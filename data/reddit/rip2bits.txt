Exodus encrypts transaction data locally for your eyes only. Your private wallet info is never stored on their servers, just on your computer. Therefore, there is nothing for them to share! Why do you believe they will be giving your wallet details to ShapeShift? Did you read that somewhere?

Hi Navajubble. I'm Davey one of the support engineers at Exodus. This is a heartbreaking story to read. :(
Have you emailed [support so we can help investigate how this happened? If not, please do so. I don't want to jump to any conclusions based on your summary above so it'd be good to ask more questions and pin point how this happened. Above all, we need to make sure your computer and any online accounts you have are safe.

What is your experience so far with the Nano S? If you're happy with the Nano, no real reason to change. 
The Model T may be more comfortable since it doesn't require a bunch of apps to manage each coin though. Plus, you can use it with Exodus wallet and easily manage and exchange your Trezor held assets using the Exodus interface.
