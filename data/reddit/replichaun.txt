Bitcoin Trumper here. I believe strongly in Bitcoin, but I also believe that Trump is speaking the truth. 
Bitcoin is currently, and will continue to grow as a conduit for funding illegal activity.  This is a side effect of its inherent ability to resist regulation. 
Bitcoin is a potential threat to the U.S. dollar. Trump is only doing what is expected to avoid that. 
Bitcoin is not backed by anything. 
Facebook’s Libra is not a true cryptocurrency and it can and should be regulated.
With that said, I hope that he realizes that fighting Bitcoin is futile.

If you have 100k to invest in Bitcoin, do it. 
Except you won’t.  Because you play it safe, and who tf am I?
But you’ll remember the time when you were ^this close to buying 8.75 BTC for 100k.

You just gotta HODL. 
When you check Bitcoin price and see that it’s plummeted? HODL. 
When you check it again and see that it’s even lower? HODL
When it ticks back up a few points? Still HODL. 
You just gotta HODL full throttle, so tight that you know those girls are HEDL.

Definitely won’t break 13k tonight ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:22:23
That’s not going to happen. A lot of open sell orders as you approach 12k. 
I should add that I only made this comment because Bitcoin always does the opposite of what I say it will.

Things have gotten screwy. 
After checking on blockchain.info, it seems that the transaction was rejected by the server for having no fees. The other major block chain browsers don't list the transaction at all. 
I didn't think that this was possible. 
Additionally, the ledger wallet app alternates between listing the transaction as unconfirmed, and not listing the transaction at all. The BTC balance is reflected accordingly. 
Now I am not sure if this transaction has really been rejected, or if it is stuck in an unconfirmed status. 
EDIT: I should add that I am unable to duplicate the transaction with an added fee. I get a "rejected by server" message. 
EDIT: ledger support team has been unresponsive so far. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:54:25
I suppose I'll just wait it out. 
What has me baffled though is that the blockchain's only record of the transaction is a rejection, yet the coins are still "stuck". 
When I reset the Ledger interface it recognizes my balance and doesn't display the rejected confirmation. Everything is fine. 
If I try to repeat the transaction, however, it clears the interface but becomes immediately rejected at the block chain level. Also, whenever I refresh the Ledger interface after resetting it, the failed transaction displays as "unconfirmed" and my BTC balance drops accordingly. 
What this tells me is that some nodes must still be queuing this transaction while others have already forgotten. I just don't understand why all new transactions are being rejected.

Well, they can also legally share client data with Google, Facebook, Amazon. It doesn’t change the fact that a crypto exchange engaging in politics and blacklists raises red flags.
