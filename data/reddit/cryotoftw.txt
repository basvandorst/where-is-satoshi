What do you think it will be?

I live this story. I wish i would have jumped in earlier. A friend got me in it. I was resistant few a while, and finally jumped in. I wish i would have listened to him earlier, as i missed June 2017 massive pump. My own fault. I am in now and doing what you said, putting 5% of paycheck, and any other funds i can gather up. I want to be retired early like you. 
The guy who got my friend into it is well one his way to retirement and no debt. No wonder big banks hate crypto. I need to get to that point before powers that be, big banks and govt ruin it for the average joe. They wont let us win like this IMHO. I’m not saying crypto will go away, just they will fuck it up for the little guy. Again, my opinion.

Moral judgement? Was project Ajax shitty, ya. So Iran has a revolution and kidnaps Americans and hold the hostage for 400 days. OPEC stops selling oil to the US which caused serious issues in 70....Tit for tat
Fast forward a few decades, Iran is the biggest funder of global terrorism. Killed many US troops in Iraq. Funds ISIS, who mass murder village after village. Burning people alive, cutting off heads, etc. Syria, ya Iran supported the murderous dictator there too. Now they have nukes. The EXACT people you don’t want having nukes, have nukes. They will Proliferate to terrorist and there will be a dirty bomb go off somewhere. But, America is the evil empire. Stfu. 
Not saying we have not done some shady shit (Iraq war) but trying to keep the oil flowing and capitalism alive in Iran is not one. The was part of the Cold War and what needed to be done. 
Moral judge that shit.

Ya, its awesome. The can keep the terrorist funded well. Way to go idiot. Oh, and “illegal sanctions? “. They repeatedly broke every rule in the deal they made. Maybe we should drop ship a few more c130’s loaded with pallets of cash to fund their terror and nuke program. That worked well. How much should we send? Another 400 billion? Double it?  Or let’s just do a trillion in hundreds. Ffs
Do you actually pay attention to what’s going on there, or just doing the ole trendy hate America thing?
@_date: 2019-07-11 02:16:20
Not ducking shit. All that bs you posted is fact-less. No, we didn’t cause a bunch on religious radicals to become dictators or kill whom ever does not believe what they believe. Why don’t you move there, kiss a girl in public and be lashed to death. Their whole way of life is formed on radical religion and you don’t know shit about it. 
And you’re an idiot if you think we assassinated out own president. Really should not waste time with someone so uninformed. Bye Felecia. Not worth my time explaining shit to a door knob

Never been to r/thedonald amigo. I just enjoy telling people that hate America to fuck off. yes, America is the best country ever created on this planet and because of it, you get to enjoy countless inventions that have made your life much more enjoyable and easier. I am not really going to go into the products, medical advancements, and tech you surly like to talk shit on certain websites with, but it was all created here. .
The best always gets the most criticism. Enjoy the ac and free porn, amigo

Racist....way to go following the MSNBC handbook dumb ass. When all else fails, use “racist” uh?

Not sure where you live, above the north pole, etc. i am also not sure how old you are, but in 2008 a gallon was $4.50, and the economy shit the bed. There were other factors, but gas prices broke the camels back and it is that simple.    
Where ever you live, you decided to live with 7.50 per gallon. Its $2.19 at every station around me.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:42:31
Definitely, but if the people over 30, as you say, make money, they create jobs for the next generation. The next generation will be more into crypto. Crypto, unfortunately will not take off fast. Buy now, cause in ten years, when that generation has jobs, it will take off. There still needs to be easier ways to transfer money and buy coins. Until that is as simple as swiping credit cards, it will go mainstream. People are scared to use Apple Pay at the moment. Crypto has a long way to go, but I am buying now so I can retire early.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:06:02
I understand what you’re saying. If prices hit $7.50 per gallon in the US there would be another Great Depression. That would effect the global economy. 
I asked your age and where you lived not to be offensive, but 10 years ago, you may have been in high school and not remember. It may have not effected you at all. 
It was a disaster here in the states. There were other factors to the crash, but when average price per gallon hit $4.50, people were being laid off by the thousands around the country. Unemployment skyrocketed. Housing market crashed as banks stopped lending and people were foreclosing. Many lost everything they had. 
I will never forget it, and it taught me that the economy is way more fragile than I would have ever thought and to be prepared for the next crash the best I can.

The original comment was about Irans crypto and it being a wonderful thing for them. I pointed out that how stupid that is and surely it because the poster was gonna go down the ole trendy path of I hate America. That the lefts agenda, correct? That’s what is boils down to. Sorry the “orange tariffs and wall” don’t work for you. 
Does that help you understand, “dipshit?”
And don’t worry, I will get my peace. I appreciate the sentiment though.

The economy is going to be steady for a few years unless something serious happens. Gas hits $4.50 per gallon and you will get your wish, but that should not happen. WW3, I doubt that will happen too. The economy is more fragile than most think, but we should be steady for years, but there will be ups and downs, but not dramatic turns. I hope so anyway.

Best economy in the country’s history. What a piece of shit. Jobs help people BUY Bitcoin. Its not free
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:30:44
Sad part, he will get at least 40% of your $/BTC. By the time you get a check, it will be scraps of what you had after fees, etc. they will draw this out to bill more hours....you get screwed again. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:59:14
That is what im doing, but i check the market every 13 seconds.....:(
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:38:18
Seems every time something new comes out this happens. I am guilty of it. People need to think about what they are saying before opening their mouth; me included. I agree, this must have hurt to hear; especially from heros of yours
It probably gave him more gumption to make this work though. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:42:15
Yep, up voted. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:50:18
I believe we are just at the start of this. I truly believe that and even the chairman said in the SEC meeting that crypto market is in its infancy stage. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:26:44
It his damn money and should be free to buy whatever he wants. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:37:39
Watch the hearing.......
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:42:38
Such a stupid reply. Maybe we should get rid of all currencies b/c it could fund terrorism. Get real please
