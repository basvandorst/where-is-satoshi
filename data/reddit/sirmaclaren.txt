Yang has said he's pro crypto. Gabbard had to declare she invested like $1,000 into ether last bull run. Otherwise I haven't heard anything.

but I've already watched them all :(

And then they later teamed up with the Persians to kill the Athenians...

Had the same issue too (Canadian). The moble app still sent funds.

I think in the states they are just starting to get chips in their cards. (please correct if wrong)

Has there been recent news about a CT soft fork? Thought that was still far away.

Yeah, he's what you find after the swamp is drained.

Funny thing is gold is probably one the easiest things to buy online with bitcoin.

You should download the Bitcoin Core wallet and use electrum personal server. This way you can verify amounts by checking your own copy of the blockchain. Otherwise there isn't really a point in using wasabi.

That's a Bingo!

There was an inflation bug early on that required a rollback. Pretty sure there was at least one other time in the early days.

that's what the 21 weekly is saying...

There is also a positive correlation between amount of taxes paid and general happiness of the population. (Denmark, Sweden etc)
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:33:10
I agree, but if someone is going to claim taxes are harmful in general then they need to address why a positive correlation exists.

Easier to handle refunds if they funnel bitcoin through gift cards. Steam dropped bitcoin payments I think for issues related to refunds and price volatility.

Is there anyone who sells Bitcoin in 24k/22k gold coins?
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:37:19
Prob need confidential transactions before LN for more widespread spending. Having a merchant see how much you have leftover in your address is insane.

Ellen is a great stand-up. Prob find her old stuff somewhere on youtube. Pretty sure Whoopi started in stand-up too. Say what you will of their recent work though...

This guy knows how to HODL

Yeah it's just an extra layer of security that can be easily done without a computer. If your safe gets stolen/broken into, gives you a better chance to win the race against some subset of attackers.

The keystone XL pipeline was suppose to bypass the need to get Venezuela oil for the Koch industries refinery in Corpus Christi TX. But that is getting held up in the courts so now time for plan B. Them Koch brothers need their oil...
