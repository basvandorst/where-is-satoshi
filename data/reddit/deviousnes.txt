Yesterday were presented at CeBIT, the Linux New Media Awards. The Bitcoin received the award in the category "most innovative open source project".Representing the Federation Bitcoin and the scene has Flaskämper Oliver, Managing Director of Bitcoin.de, accepted the award.
The Medialinx AG, headquartered in Munich, is the world's largest content providers around Linux and open source.Together with the CeBIT Open Source, the company distinguished once a year out projects, organizations, individuals and companies for their outstanding services around Linux and open source.
Yesterday it was at CeBIT that time again. When it came to the presentation of the award for the most innovative open source project, presented moderator Michael Fellner the microphone to the open-source expert Thomas Uhl. This said, the units awarded project was "a bit of it" - he shook his smartphone - and "a bit cryptography. Damn a lot of cryptography. "Some would say it's a gamble, others that it was fraud, and still others that one could lose a lot of money and the next said it was no money at all, while others said it was the future of the Digital Economy .
Would not you know after the second sentence, what it's about, right? As the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, was not available because of its continuous anonymity, Uhl presented the award to Oliver Flaskämper, which she took in his capacity as a board member of the Association of Bitcoins as well as representative of the German Bitcoin scene.
In his acceptance speech, Oliver Flaskämper explained that Bitcoin.de the largest Bitcoin marketplace in Europe is well, but he hoped that there will soon be more exciting: "We need much more infrastructure." Then he was still following nice set of itself: "Wikipedia has revolutionized the knowledge, twitter and facebook freedom of expression, and the Bitcoin revolutionized the money."
There is nothing more to add to, just a final note: The ceremony will soon stream on the website of the Linux magazine to be seen.

This just in: Bitcoin may destroy our Utopian society!
There is a new virtual currency threatening to soil the very fabric of our existence.  It's called Bitcoin and it has the potential to introduce CRIME!  Yes crime people!   The virtual currency allows people to act selfishly because they are anonymous when using it.  Even in person Bitcoin can hide the identify of the people using it, because of it's extreme complexity.  We must act now or Bitcoin might cause human extinction by infecting everyone with its selfishness!  So grab a sheet and a cross and let's find these "Bitcoiners"!!!

@_date: 2014-01-14 23:30:17
I would too, but doesn't the price not moving imply that as a community we trust them to do the right thing? I thought the point of the blockchain was to remove the need to "trust" a third party.  Wither they do anything or not, achieving more than 50% breaks this, or am I missing something?

On a serious note, could they gain 100% control by only propagating their own new blocks?  If so couldn't they do whatever they wanted, or am I missing something?  I don't think they could spend others nmc as they wouldn't have the private keys, but I'm not sure that's the case.

I've been looking at setting one of these up, but can't keep it running long enough.  I just rebuilt on a fresh OS and have had over 12h uptime, a first for me since the beta release.  However that's just with me using it.  I tried setting up a cron job to restart it every so often, but have had no luck with that.  It's nothing special, just
/OpenBazaar/./stop.sh &amp;&amp; /OpenBazaar/./run.sh

Yes, the first time I did this the waitress needed help (she was new.)  I walked in Applebee's with no cash, and a tablet with a Bitcoin wallet.  Jumped on their WiFi, opened up gyft and ordered a gift card after ordering the food.  When it was time to pay they entered the card info from the tablet screen and had me sign a receipt, as if I'd payee with a cc.  I've done this numerous times now and would suggest purchasing the gyft card before going, just in case, but I've never had a problem. You can tip from the gyft card as well.  Not near as cool as paying directly in btc, but works great in the mean time.

This is not a fuckin' thing you should gamble on, all right?

I hope he takes karp place on Bitcoin foundation, it would certainly give them a sense of legitimacy. Perhaps he could light a fire under their proverbial ass and they may actually help BTC rather than just saying they do...
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:58:08
Sounds like they may be needing another bailout.
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:12:35
New reddit user?  Hmmm
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:27:02
Go for it ☺
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:25:01
OpenSource and decentralization, is it perfect?  No, it's just a hell of a lot better than we have now.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:38:56
I hope not

Awesome!  I think it was the web browser opening up that was causing the problem.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-17 16:15:17
The code is far from complete, for example Bitcoin can not handle anywhere near the amount of transactions cc companies do, and if Bitcoin is going to boom, it will have to be competitive with the current solutions.
@_date: 2014-10-03 05:01:04
I used circle today, no problems...
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:04:13
That would be awesome!
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:39:07
If its that big of a deal just use namecoin.  Great article.
@_date: 2014-08-27 09:38:29
Anyone willing to stabilize this so I can watch it?  I'm on mobile...
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:17:12
It was dark market...
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:51:08
Couldn't have said it better myself
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:08:30
I am.  The only real problems I've had is getting BitMessage to work with OB.  
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:39:41
Me too, but I believe in nmc, so I don't want to bail unless it's really an issue.
@_date: 2015-05-07 11:04:16
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:23:23
Wow, that looks really good, I've been considering doing the same for my town.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:07:15
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:27:27
Your forgetting the awful ToS.  
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:29:35
Unless your Randy Blythe...

Boo!!!

I live in a small town in the middle of Nebraska, the only Bitcoin users here are so because of me.  Localbitcoins is not an option here.  I bought 2TH of mining equipment in 2013, but it doesn't make enough for even my use anymore.  Acquisition is the biggest hurdle, how pray tell would you acquire them without a 6 hour drive every week?  Your not wrong, but your solutions do not work for all use cases. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:49:31
This was my "other" for security measures.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:27:55
What the?
@_date: 2016-01-02 07:34:01
You know better than Satoshi?  Doubtful.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:20:54
@_date: 2019-06-03 19:54:11
It sure is for the person that left the $ on the exchange for the buy order.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:50:33
Thank you, that's kinds what I thought too. So is there a reason the miners wouldn't just leave BCh back to BTC when this happens? Especially with all the profits coming in for transaction fees.  
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:53:02
But, this is really cool!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:45:53
In what manner is this fud?  
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:52:45
Good gravy, that should have been edited first.  No one cares what you order.  The video should have been less than a minute long.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:34:15
I too would like to understand this better. Is there a way I can be notified when someone replies to your post?
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:24:50
Scamcoin, not news.....
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:04:53
I would participate if it happened here.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:54:48
username checks out
@_date: 2015-11-15 22:25:08
Ya it's not on Reddit, so not interested....
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:16:18
Those are FUTURE plans right?  Ya, ISN'T Open Source, CAN'T be used without scam coin.  Pull your head out of your ass and stop saying what MAY be SOMEDAY, is.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:56:41
Exactly.  Apples and oranges.
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:14:40
Your a dip shit.  Show me source code.
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:56:17
1. Not Open Source
2. Uses a pump n dump scam coin.
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:12:42
To be clear the "gold" standards of the past were inflated as well, by reducing purity and even gold coating.  This is not possible with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-26 03:08:32
Is there no video?
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:27:37
Every time I try to create an account, I get "Application error 500"
Even though all the form fields get a green check mark, including pgp...
No trades for me :-(
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:27:25
Wanna sell that? :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:17:42
Funny I've been looking into doing this for a couple weeks. Nebraska winters suck and Belize sounds divine right about now.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:32:35
I've been trying to sign up for three days now, same error every time.
500 Application error.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:09:31
Wow, those are awesome!  
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:19:52
Check out coinpunk, it allows you to use a web browser as a wallet, including camera qr scanning
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:17:29
If I understand it correctly miners still need the whole blockchain. If growth, particularly in retail, accelerates and we are doing even a small amount of credit card transaction numbers, miners will need large arrays to hold all of it. Or is that changing as well?
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:41:35
It's the new trading engine. If so litecoin may be coming to gox soon!)
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:24:50
If you aren't afraid of running your own server, you should consider coinpunk.
It's a web based wallet you host on your own, and it's got web based phone camera support, so even if an app is blocked (apple), you can still use your btc!
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:20:05
Perhaps they are about ready to implement midas?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:16:42
They are adding features all the time, but it's in beta and available.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:29:22
Yes, please do this!
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:56:56
Just ordered the latest CD with Bitcoin.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:48:38
Just made a donation!-)

Application error 500 every time attempting to sign up... For days same thing... :-(
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:26:02

Let's see if I can do this...
