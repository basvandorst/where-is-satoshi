Misleading title.
Bernanke did not state this, ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King is the one who stated the quote in question. 
"King said that one of the lessons learned from that financial crisis is that one should not invest in things that one does not understand. He proved this point by stating:
"The algorithm used to help determine the value of bitcoin may prove problematic.""

This. As a owner of a large farm, I would love this.

We use Bitpay for our Shopify store... might look into this.

We have been accepting bitcoin for months on Shopify, using bitpay. Does Shopify's built in not support being paid out in BTC?

RockMiner is one of the first, so we are carrying their R-Box and X-box line of products. The big one should be available in end of june, small one is available now.

We will be carrying these as soon as they are available, we already have the small R-Boxes that do 35-40gh @ ~1w/gh.

Not when you can go into a physical microcenter store and *gasp* purchase one then and there.
