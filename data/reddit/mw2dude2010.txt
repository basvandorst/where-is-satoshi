I'm also in eight grade and I would like to say that it is very rare for a 14 year old to know about bitcoin.

I'm 14 and my dad asked my sisters boyfriend who is a financial planner if it would be a good idea to invest in bitcoin before he would let me buy a coin. He said no because it was "unstable", that was last month and now its at 780.
