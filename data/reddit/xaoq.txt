Aren't there virtual cards available where you are? I have a couple of them - it's basically .pdf with card details, load it with cash and can pay online just fine. I didn't even register them on real name, no one cares. I can hook you up with such "card" if you like, you just need 15 min and google translator. I registered those through tor just fine.
Also, I can use my debit card like that as well. Can set my own limits, but of course it won't ever go negative, unlike real credit cards.

Neither of my vpns also care about DMCA bullshit. They are simply better and safer to use than ip-logging-dmca-happy vpn.
Let me emphasize that: **We will store a time stamp and IP address when you connect and disconnect to our VPN service together with the IP address of the individual VPN server used by you.**
This is outright matching users private IP with the VPN server he uses, which means **it is by no means safe vpn**

Wrong. Your fault for using the same machine for bitcoin AND surfing. Guess how antivirus works: it detects and disables/removes KNOWN virii. If it's not known, and heuristics not catch it, then virus will work just fine. 
Never go anywhere near bitcoin with your windows machines or any machines that you browse internet from.
Just buy old $50 thinkpad, add $50 SSD, slap some linux on it (make sure to enable full disk encryption) and install bitcoin-qt there. Don't do anything else, in fact, remove all browsers, email clients, IM etc.
As a matter of fact, I don't even have my bitcoin laptop connected to internet: on a router level (openwrt + custom iptables) it is ONLY allowed to one IP on my local network, and ONLY one port: bitcoin. This bitcoin-machine can ONLY connect to other bitcoin-qt running, with no funds on, only to relay transactions and blockchain.

I get it, a healthy amount of ridicule against that idiot who wants BitLicense is fine. But in the end, he has NO POWER to do anything. We would have to collectively agree to give him that power.

Or better, buy $100 laptop, install linux on it and only use for bitcoins and nothing more. Make sure firewall is in place - and if you're extra paranoid, only allow connection to one, specified ip:port which is a trusted bitcoind running on other computer (empty, it's just to relay transactions), to protect from attacks against the program if it'd be found to have bugs in how it handle connections.

I don't agree with you, but this is a moot discussion anyway: they've been accepting it [for quite some time already]( - damage, if any, has been done, and that was when bitcoin was much much much more vulnerable.

I don't know why, but if you'd look at the older posts here (and bitcointalk maybe) about wikipedia you'll see this notion. In general, wikipedia editors are VERY and openly anti-bitcoin. If someone outside of their clique tries to edit that, they will simply revert it.
You can even notice it still includes "ponzi scheme" allegation there, because someone somewhere said that. That was accepted as valid source. But to be accepted as currency definition, 10 times better sources were not enough.

You're missing my point. You can write the absolutely perfect PHP code, make sure everything is working fine. Since you're responsible sysadmin you keep your packages updated - and one day it turns out that your newly installed php [no longer returns hashes, now it returns only salt]( You can say that no one uses this function like that - ok. But how in the fucking world did this EVER happen?! Where is the testing? How did this get marked as "stable"? Stable but never tested?!
Besides, PHP is always a shit code. No real exception handling, completely retarded comparision operator (you can prove true == false with it) etc. Also the way it is deployed is fucking retarded too. Yes, just put .php file in webserver dir and it'll be executed? What could go wrong? Oh right, bad script will let you write another script into file. Forgot this part.
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:44:13
Chrome can and will automatically update extensions. Probably periodic check on the KK found instruction to not update, but delete.
I suggest that anyone using chrome, go to ~/.config/chromium/Default and edit file Preferences. There, change
    "update_url": "
    "update_url": "
\- Do it for every extension. Also, just to be sure, append
    0.0.0.0 clients2.google.com
to /etc/hosts. This should prevent it from auto-updating.

I'm referencing a bug in **STABLE** version that should never have gotten there in the first place. It's just one of many bugs too, you think it's something unusual for php?


File upload with progress indicator. Real-world example of web-app that would be useful. 
Because of how php is deployed, it will get to know about file's presence only after it's been uploaded in full. (just please don't google now an example shit code that relies on bizzarre hacky techniques, or, most of the time, just using nginx upload module and call it php upload)

So you have datacenters in other parts of the world, but you are still USA company, correct? So you still have to respond to all kinds of USA's secret service demands? Handing over customer data, backdoor their servers etc, and of course can't notify them? After the NSA revelations we all have to be extra careful. 


That would be great, but let me ask you, is that really needed?
1. No chargebacks. No one can put you at risk of losing money. I'm a fan of using bit-pay or simillar for payments.
2. Terms of use apply to everyone, so you can just kick out the abusers, no matter how they paid

There are 21'000'000  full bitcoins, but each bitcoin can be represented as 1.00000000 (and possibly more zero's in the future). Which means there are
2'100'000'000'000'000 units that can be traded. 21 million + 8 zeroes.

Only way to tell if given server is hosting given tor address, is observing the times when tor address doesn't work AND the given server stops working. It's also not perfect and you're never sure. And you must have that server info from somewhere (e.g. you're big bad CIA network and you put that server under surveliance). There are a couple more assumptions, like the server even being reachable from outside ...

What? You do realize wallet is simply a file that holds key pairs, so if you drop around parts of this file there is a chance *some* of the keys held inside will be intact and whoever found one part may gain access to one of your addresses, after  putting those keys into his wallet.dat?
Not very good idea...

Also, make this computer have no access to internet at all. Only access to another computer in your LAN on only one port (8333). The other "unsecure" computer running bitcoin to receive funds, then you send funds to secure computer acting as your bank.

Then you can just spread the whole encrypted file. And not worry that you can't recover one part out of N parts.

Something like that. It simply stores your private/public keys so you can claim bitcoins signed with them. I just want an ability to password those keys, just like i can do with gpg and ssh keys.

He said he uses cheats for at least 5 years now. I wonder what's the point of that. Even if he wins with someone, he can't say he's good or that it was good match. He knows he sucks and needs cheats to win... he knows he has no chance vs others and is simply bad and weak. 
I still play diablo 2, and there is A LOT of cheaters. I'd say 50% of all players. Good thing is that they are completely clueless of the game and still lose to good players. It always makes me wonder what's the point of cheating.

Think of it that way: if you do it that way, you only generate that wallet once and then you're ready to sweep at any second. 100% of your work will go towards increasing the number of addresses you control.

Well, bitcoin miners can do sha256, except they do it twice and on fixed length input, so pretty much useless for actual password cracking. I'm not saying I want an asic to do all kinds of hashes, but specialized - eg this is for md5, this for sha1, this for sha256 .. etc.

[Yes it is]( But you should note that it doesn't guarantee anything.

Any and all of them.
I'd probably use Scala or Erlang, but there is nothing wrong with using eg. python, ruby, java, javascript (nodejs)... those can be perfectly safe and are easy to code for the web.
Only if we choose eg. ruby or python, some of the backend parts have to be coded in "faster" language, or we might end up with mtgox style lag. 
Also: even more important, database. Fuck mysql, for transactions we should be using some nosql database like mongodb, couchdb, mnesia ... and sql, if any, only for stuff like account settings, profile etc.

Basically, you never want a server in your own country or country that most of your visitors are from.
But then, I strongly recommend Iceland. orangewebsite.com accepts bitcoins! I have few servers with them, awesome support, friendly, but prices are kinda high.
Other than that, Netherlands and Sweden are decent hosting places. 
"Exotic" places are good too, but usually expensive (and limited bandwidth): Malaysia, Hong-kong, Panama, Bahamas, Signapore.
Romania is very often recommended by hostings as well. Cheap and good.

Wikipedia is kinda weird when it comes to bitcoin.
Editors actively seek and remove any information even remotely regarding bitcoin as a currency, instead they leave out things like "Ponzi scheme". I know anyone can edit, but those edits get reverted and it's left with "Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's Ponzi scheme. Wikipedia doesn't accept ponzi scheme" ... I wonder if that will ever change?

And what programs would that be? Suddenly, it feels like 100% of comments about it are from users absolutely needing a variety of very specialized programs only running on windows ... if I wanted I could probably find someone who absolutely can't leave his VMS and use windows ;-)
Also: are those programs really that much more important than your safety and privacy?
either way, a pendrive with secure linux install and your coins costs $5, and a dedicated netbook you can keep in your safe is $250 or maybe less 
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:39:54
Also look at last week. People crying "bitcoin is over!!!11oneoneone" because it dropped some, but is still worth more than last week, are just fucking dumb

I mean, if a dedicated server costs $2000 a year, we can get 50 years worth of hosting of 5 servers for $500000, assuming its 1 btc = $100, that's 5000 btc. Remaining 1000 btc (or $100.000) can easily buy you a proper development team.

Best secure alternative - self-hosted server in Iceland or simillar. It's not that hard to setup, and the result is actually secure for you and your friends. Make sure the disk is encrypted and you're good to go.

The GSM chip is a proprietary blob of wires, which is accompanied with binary blob of code to use it. There was a leaked 4000-page long technical documentation book for one. But in short: if you'd be to start the next samsung/nokia/wtf, you would have to licence those chips and use them as they want you to. In short: no
BUT! Some older phones allowed you to change the IMEI, be it with special software (usually only available for technicians... EXCEPT we have internet now) or even by short codes, procedure simillar to removing sim-lock. Quick google told me, for example, nokia 9210, type "* and it should change your IMEI. To which? No idea. But it's worth checking which phones allow that.
Also, there was an OpenMoko phone, which was pretty much 100% free, hardware, software.. except binary blob to use gsm chip and the chip itself. I have asked developers once how to change imei, but they were reluctant to answer. NDA most likely, but on openmoko I would need special hardware anyway, they said, hardware only they had.

The louhi nameservers return netherlands ip server, the forum is on it.
The cloudflare's nameservers return cloudflare IPs, and that doesn't quite work. Cloudflare is unable to connect to backend server they setup.
So tl;dr it seems they are doing some server changes. I don't know if they migrate TO cloudflare or FROM but it's either one of that, and cloudflare setup doesn't work (yet or anymore)

It baffles me that there is still a lot of wikipedia editors who actively oppose bitcoin. Not the "I don't like bitcoin", not "I don't believe it works", nor "I first hear of it".

I would say, either one of ewallets or those -lite clients for his smartphone.

Your forum is not a solution. If anything, look up the old bitcointalk thread about things they want integrated and supported by forum; there was a treasure trove for those who develop it. Make up something like that and you might have a chance at being the accepted forum.

I don't really see anything wrong with JS. It's implementation is really fast and designed to handle really big load without problems. The big problem is the way of coding in it, everything is asynchronous so it takes time to get used to it. Besides, frontend, the web part shouldn't be doing any operations by itself, only queue them for being checked &amp; executed by the backend.
I have actually tried to find some "real-time" databases, nada.. closest thing are just very fast key-value stores, which obviously can be replicated to traditional database as archive.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:35:39
If you have 1 BTC consisting of thousands of inputs, it might require more fees than one made of one input, hence being worth a little less. Or even not possible to be spent in one transaction, requiring several of them so it won't exceed the transaction size limit.
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:46:17
Exactly that's why it's easier and more feasible to get a list of common words, phrases from books and movies and be within VERY reasonable number of, lets say, million addresses. Have them up for instant use, whenever a coin shows up. INSTEAD of trying to find collisions.

@_date: 2013-04-24 20:33:37
I think the only thing it means is that PayPal would try and own the bitcoin. Fund your account in bitcoin but never be able to withdraw bitcoins from them again. Money funded by bitcoin will be under extra scrutiny. Slowly, paypal will start to hold on to majority of currency and never releasing it.
There will be a group of people who don't like that, and will never use paypal with bitcoin, but that doesn't matter. Because they can either never spend the coins (so it'll be as useful as that collection of rocks you had in 3rd grade) or if they spend it, sooner or later someone else will fund paypal with them. Sooner or later, bitcoin will be dead, because it'll only exist in limbo of paypal and few collectors who - if ever try to do a transaction with it - will only indirectly send it to the limbo anyway.
I think it would be a disaster ...

And what's the alternative? Going through a list of words and phrases, checking one by one until you find something with enough funds? That is very very slow. And needs to be re-checked every now and then to be effective. Instead, do it once but store results in a wallet.
Kinda like rainbow tables.

There is plenty of medicore hosts that accept bitcoin, but only a handful (so far found one) that:
- politically friendly country - no DMCA bullshit, no censorship. Nordic EU countries rule.
- Do not require anything but email. Seriously, there is one ALMOST PERFECT hosting but... they require email validation, phone validation and can request scanned ID. Bullshit, no thanks.
- good hosting packages, eg. decent hardware, bandwidth for decent prices.
- Be flexible. For example if someone wants extra hardware allow it. That includes KVM-over-ip, anti-ddos firewalls etc.
What I want right now, and willing to pay?
- Good Xeon/i7 based systems (with enough ram, disks etc)
- kvm-over-ip REQUIRED AT ALL TIMES :)
- no-questions-asked no-bullshit hosting in EU or eg. Bahamas, Russia etc.
- decent bandwidth, extra ip's possible, maybe 1gbit network (shared, burst)
- choice of operating systems, SAY NO TO CENTOS
- decent price, maybe with discounts if you go for longer term payments
One company I really like is orangewebsite. It's not cheap but their service and support is awesome, and they're in about the most internet-friendly country in the world. Take a look at them and see if you can go for that :)
That for dedis. VPS, I have much different requirements, but in general:
- decent RAM. Nothing too crazy but 1gb would be nice.
- decent disk. Most of VPS have about 10-20 gb... sometimes it's more than enough, sometimes it's less than RAM I have on other servers
- some kind of control panel so that I can reboot it
Two first points configurable, just what I mean is ability to get what I need without arbitrary hard limits.
(note that personally I have no interrest in cheap shared hosting. Just doesn't cut it)

Basically, I consider the way of deploying php a bad practice. Throw a code into webserver accessible place and get it executed? Really? That sounds really bad. And that is the reason why all the php based software is vulnerable. From what I saw in other threads, it's likely the reason why bitcointalk was hacked.
Every other language that deals with webapps is done differently. Off the top of my head, scala+lift (which I really want to explore soon), erlang+mochiweb/chicagoboss, nodejs, ruby+rails/sinatra, python+django/pylons etc etc. All of them are actually deployed, not just put at random into webserver root. You control the process, you can inspect it live. I feel that any and all of the above are way better endgame solutions than template language hacked into standalone language [that is just broken](

    256 MB Sun HBA RAID (0/1/5/6/10/50/60 RAID capability)  - what's that? 256 mb??

Use an old thinkpad (like x60) that has been tested to the core; install Coreboot on it (replaces stock BIOS); remove wifi/bluetooth if possible.
Also I don't believe in universal BIOS virus that can infect every machine. There were PoC virii infecting BIOS, but only of very specific machines at a time, and that didn't even have perfect chance to work either; sometimes it could even brick the computer.
There is MUCH bigger chance that there is a bug in armory/bitcoin-qt/electrum/wtf than there is of a virus infecting every computer through an unspecified bug in BIOS that apparently works for every single machine, even if there is no BIOS at all (Macs and their EFI-only-no-bios-emulated)

This algorithm is VERY slow, likely allows for ~500 hashes/sec, and that on optimized GPU code, multiple cards etc. And for each user it needs to hash separately, so wordlist of eg. 10000 words times 150000 users ... you're looking for days of work just for one wordlist, which won't crack everything, more like ~30% if that's first attack on the line and wordlist is good.
