Got a full refund, also paid through paypal. They have a... queue that you must sit in before your request gets answered. Took about a week, but it eventually happened.
I don't think it is a scam, I just think it is poor execution and bad social communication. A company that complains about their efforts to the public does not carry a professional image. imo.
