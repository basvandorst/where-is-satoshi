There's a reason people are more inclined to give their money to people like Steve Jobs, though. It's because, whatever you may think about him as a person, he was one of the most successful CEOs ever. Of course people will listen to what he has to say! If Steve Jobs were alive today and he offered you an opportunity to invest in one of his new ideas, wouldn't you take it a bit more seriously than if I, Joe Schmoe Redditor, tried to sell you one of my own ideas? The difference being that one of us has a proven track record of producing excellent results, and the other one (sadly) doesn't.  It's ludicrous to imply that some imagined moral superiority is the only thing keeping us from making billions.

Why are the axes of his graph set up that way? It seems to me that distorting the chart in such a way would make any sort of technical analysis completely useless.

Yeah, I'll bet his poor moral compass is why people chose to give him their money...

Why don't we just let the free market sort it out?

The lack of self-awareness here is astounding. Someone states some concerns with a generally unhelpful and unfriendly community, and your response is to accuse them of lying? What are you even basing your accusation on? Would you ask the same of someone who was saying nice things about the community? 
Unless there is some joke I'm missing out on...

How would you feel if your child's history teacher tried to convert your kids to a different religion than your own? Would it be any better if it was done under the pretense of learning more history?

So do you feel that there is no way that supporters are overestimating the utility of Bitcoin due to their own vested interests?
