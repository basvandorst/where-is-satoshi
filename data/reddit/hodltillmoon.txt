Dont we need to use the segwit bitcoin mainet node sw? I was looking at the docker tag and see: amacneil/bitcoin:latest
Wouldnt we want something like this (provided it built:)) 0.14.2-uasfsegwit0.3
Since segwit is required, is your wallet on your bitcoin node not going through as segwit tx? Not that I am complaining:) your work is stellar thus far

i think this is what i meant:
"From Brian Armstrong, Coinbase Agent, via the coinbase support site, 11 Nov 2012:
We integrate with a variety of exchanges and also hold our own reserves. When you sell your bitcoins for USD we usually sell them to other Coinbase users at some point down the line (this is where our reserves come from), but we may cash them out if needed. In general, our goal is to abstract away some of the complexity so it's a simpler process for our users. What we have now is a good start but not finished by any means. Hope it helps!"

The entire rise to $20K was meme-powered. Limiting memes would collapse the entire bitcoin system....
