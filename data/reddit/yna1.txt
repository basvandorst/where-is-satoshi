These suck

Because there's no way to prove if it is legitimate or not. I work in BSA/AML and banks don't like it because they can't mitigate large value transactions in and out of their system. But as most transmitters between banks and bitcoin are money service businesses they have to do their own KYC checks, which Coinbase and others are now doing.

This. 100% the standard industry-wide at this point.

Reason I ask is because FPF- False instruments paid in is usually either passing bad checks or knowingly attempting to deposit bad checks.

There's something missing in this story. How did you buy the btc? How were you accepting payments?
Barclay's wouldn't completely shun a customer and hot list them for FPF over one 200gbp transaction.

Bought at 774 and couldn't cash out just shy of 800, they will be hearing about this

I firmly agree with this. When btc was below 250 I was speculating 1k by the end of the year, but that could very well be the end of the week

I bought .5 Saturday when it was 477 in anticipation of today, but then got another 1 at 774 right before it tanked, I'm still holding on for hope. Needless to say I'm out at the bar right now trying to not think about it but here I am.

I'm ready for the party! My friend from Berlin said he'd fly me in when BTC hits 1k for a party. Yna is stoked!

I would like to think that you are attempting to troll, but if not I feel very sorry for you.
