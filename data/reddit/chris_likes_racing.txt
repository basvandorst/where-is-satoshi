Thanks for your help guys. Let’s say it was an exchange with an .eu at the end

It’s not only that people won’t spend money the bigger problem are the debts. Do you think for example the US would be happy if their debts grow 2% each year just through deflation?
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:05:14
I’m sorry and I’m no expert but I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t work. Companies aim to produce their products faster and faster and they don’t want to earn 2% less money each year. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:43:14
Do you talk about how it is now? Because when you leave your money on a savings account right now your interest rate has to be higher than 2% because that’s the inflation rate right now.
I don’t want to explain every detail pls just read the wiki article not just the first paragraph. That shows that deflation is really not good for the economy.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:37:46
I think they will do even better this year! but bitcoin still won’t replace fiat :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:41:55
Yes, but the companies can’t pay the same wage each year. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:44:52
1. Look up „china bubble“
2. BTC is an asset
3. Deflation will make the gap between rich and poor even bigger!
I think you are probably invested in BTC I’m too btw. Let’s say you want to buy a candy bar or a TV or a car right NOW. Would you buy it with dollar or BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:24:09
But who would invest in stocks or real estate when the daily currency is deflationary? 
I guess all economists are wrong about deflation and it is really good instead
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:53:08
I know what you mean. But companies would run in idle because people would stop buying products. Because their money increases every day. Did you click on the link?
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:40:54
It was a nice conversation:) I’m by no means an expert but I think deflation is bad but I totally accept your opinion. Actually two weeks ago I was kind of on your side but I had a long talk with a friend and everything he said about deflation made total sense to me. Anyways because I’m writing in a foreign language it’s hard for me to make my points. But I think you know what I meant :)
Have a good day. I will reach out to you when BTC replaces fiat :) :) :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:25:45
I didn’t say we need a inflationary crypto. I just said that deflationary crypto won’t work. Ideal would be neither inflationary nor deflationary 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:14:42
You are right! I think if I buy me a sandwich because I’m hungry I will help companies like Amazon or Apple big time. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:08:08
Bitcoin would cause the biggest deflation. That’s why it will never replace fiat. If it would replace fiat then nobody would spend any money because they know it gains value every day. If nobody buys anything the companies will suffer and they will fire a lot of their employees. And so on. Just look deflation on Wikipedia 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:28:15
I don’t care about the people that have debt or cash. The countries and companies will suffer. And at the end of the loop everybody will suffer
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:55:02
Right they put their money in stocks, gold and so on. That’s because it’s deflationary. So why can’t I buy candy with stocks, and gold and real estate?
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:27:00
Because we don’t know if BTC goes up or down. If it is the only currency it will 100% go up. I don’t say we wouldn’t spend it at all. But if we would spend 10% less that would be enough to lower the prices and cripple the economy. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:50:37
Ah ok. Today I produce 1 car each day and get 1 BTC next year I produce 10 cars each day and get 1 BTC each day. The production increased but not the currency. If you want such a system then I’m ok with that :) 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:18:58
What about the student that has to pay his debt because he payed for university? His debt would grow 3% each year just through deflation.
I’m not sure if he would buy a candy bar :)
Also why would I take risks and put my money into the stock market when I make 3% just by HODLING BTC? I guess companies would be really happy if less people invest.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:52:07
Yeah crypto will replace FIAT but BTC won’t replace FIAT
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:34:50
But the companies won’t make 8% return in deflationary system. They will be happy if they can pay their employees. How do you think a contract would look like? We pay you a 6 BTC salary the first year and the next years we pay you 6 BTC - 3% each year. After 23 years u finally earn 3 BTC congratulations :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:44:24
“Lol.  Ignorance persists because it seems true to noobs. “
100% agreed :) 
So please stop ignoring facts

Because your post was so nice I will answer you again.
Warren Buffett has a net worth of over $80 billion. So let’s say there is someone like him when bitcoin has replaced fiat. That would mean over $80 billion worth of BTC are out of circulation. And there is no way to compensate that. How many bananas do you suggest he should eat?
If there is a deflationary scenario people would be dumb to not hoard their money. The people can manipulate the value of their currency. Do I have to eat? Yes! Do I have to eat fancy and expensive food? No! If 50% of the population think like you and 50% think the way I do then we are not talking about getting 1 banana today and 1.25 bananas next month. We are talking about 5 bananas next week.
So people don’t hoard because they are afraid that they can get more for the same price. People will hoard because they know they can force lower prices that way.
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:14:00
What if you just spend 450$ and hold on to 550$ because you make your lunch yourself? And save some BTC because it gains value. Holding on doesn’t mean you will spend nothing. It just means maybe you spend a little less than usually. Like you said you pay with fiat now because BTC is gaining value.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:25:45
Ok I guess all economists are amateurish then :)
I’m a noob that’s true. But even a noob with common sense can see that deflation doesn’t work.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:19:36
No, people would store their money and the companies have to lower their prices to keep the customers to buy their products. Instead the companies dept grows every year by 2%.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:29:16
100% agreed
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:54:02
Yeah that’s no argument though. Read the full wiki article 
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:44:44
Pls don’t be mad. I was polite enough to answer your first point but I just tend to ignore moronic arguments like yours.
What has deflation to do with time preference? Right, absolutely nothing!
I’m pretty sure you will find an argument why deflation is good. No one with common sense would back up this argument, economists won’t back up this argument and science won’t back up this argument but in your tini tiny brain it makes sense. And that’s totally ok. Actually it makes me feel happy for you :)
But please don’t expect me to answer again.
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:52:58
Just read about deflation yourself i‘m tired of explaining.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:57:45
I don’t know maybe because you would like to keep your job? Or maybe because in the US everybody is buying with credit card and with a deflationary system not only the currency gains more and more value but also your debts. Deflation is like rising the interest rates. You saw a couple of days ago what happened to the Dow Jones...and there where just rumors about higher interest rates.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:33:46
Yeah but BTC will never replace FIAT. That’s the same why gold is no real currency. The currency has to grow with the economy. Gold can’t do that and bitcoin can’t do that. When BTC would replace FIAT why should I buy a used car for 1 BTC if I could just wait 2 month and buy a new BMW for 1 BTC. That’s what would happen in a deflationary scenario. It sounds good at first for customers but the economy would collapse,
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:25:57
Gold was a currency. What happened to gold? Why isn’t it used in daily life anymore?
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:10:11
If we would have a deflationary currency nobody would invest in gold, stocks, real estate and so on. Just hold your deflationary currency and wait for the anarchy 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:33:12
That doesn’t make any sense. We live in a inflationary system that’s why I bought the computer now. Because in 2 month I probably get only 99% of a computer for the same money :)
Don’t get me wrong I think Blockchain is huge and BTC can be used as a store of value similar to gold. But BTC will never replace FIAT. Will a crypto ever replace FIAT? I definitely think so but not a crypto with a fix supply.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:16:18
Controlled supply is a different story. But fixed supply doesn’t work.
It could be controlled by an algorithm or something. Idk ��
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:04:14
I think he can explain it better than I ever could.
