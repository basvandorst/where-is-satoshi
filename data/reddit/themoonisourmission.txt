This is incredible. I've followed Bitcoin since 2013 when I joined reddit but have never invested unfortunately. I felt the need to comment because this is the  most amazing thing I have not only seen in r/Bitcoin, but the best thing I have seen on Reddit, EVER. The lives this money will change is unfathomable, it could be the money that solves a water crisis indefinitely for a nation and could be the money that puts food on the table for entire villages in a 3rd world country, the good this will bring to people in need is just awesome! $86 million is a lot of money and asking how to circulate it is super cool as well. Good on you OP - cheers on having the  best post to ever be on Reddit in my opinion.

'Murica is the land of knock on the door unless there is a no solicitor sign :)

For the record if the roof is missing a shingle and that style shingle is readily available at a store I cannot get a whole roof bought. I see how I put that looked bad. Simply so many people have discontinued siding or shingles and in no way is there a substitute that would look proper. That happens with almost any product that is over 10 years old which is alot of homes have discontinued roofing or siding. 90% of the time your insurance adjuster will not just pay for the whole thing and a contractor has to do the leg work.

You are uneducated.  I hope you pay them high premiums and get a storm and have a half red half orange roof then you will understand. .
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:27:15
That is true also
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:25:19
Have several stories of police doing the opposite of what should have been done and ruined lives in the making. My brother is a cop and there is a sooo much corruption it's sick.
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:25:33
Yes haha. I did get into it for easy money but its also a passion now. Sometimes im explain stuff wromg this being a time
Edit: sales is no easy money it takes alot of work. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:35:04
I know how to read your homeowners policy and that makes me a fraud?? Id say when the insurance comes out and pays to replace one piece when your policy clearly states you have full replacement and matching coverage its theninsurance company ripping off the homeowners. Thanks but im an honest dude
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:29:58
Yup and alot of people are like that. Although the majority of people dont climb their rooof every year and inspect it which I simply offer for free (after a storm) not trying to change your mind man I fucking hate people knockimg on my door also lol
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:03:16
Your previous comment already insinuated that pretty much to a T.  As yours is not mine either. Glad we understand.  I wish you the best in your bitcoin adventure and many moneys   
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:27:01
Ive stumbed upon people that were also just about to spend 14 grand out of their pocket for a new roof and they had no idea they had hail damage. After I talked with them their bill was their deductable only and the "contractor" he already had should have noticed the insurance coverable damage but didn't
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:20:57
Agreed 
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:58:37
Thats the mission

Advertisement is good - I can gaurantee if a vacuum salesman came to your door you may send him packing but will not influence you not to purchase a vacuum in the future when needed. Example.  Guy takes flyer hears 3 words from door knocker and puts flyer in garbage. 3 months later that same guy overheres a coworker talking about bitcoin and his "solid" investment. Boom he remembers the guy who knocked on his door. Trust me. People hate door knockers but word of mouth is everything 
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:58:29
Source: just fucking google it.
 Insurance companies are vultures when it comes to filing a claim. Ever wonder why the insurance company wants to evalute your damage? So they can nope right the fuck out and on to the next one
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:35:21
kids are at more risk being shot at school than I am knocking on doors I believe. But thanks for your insight.  Hey I hate when people knock on my door too. But it pays more than six figures so im game buddy.
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:31:23
Well ya of course. But here in Murica where the police collaborate between departments in an effort to look like a hero.  For instance.   Joe calls the police because sally has not been herself for a few months and he finds sally meth pipes in his house and knows sally needs help immediately.  Police show up take the pipes without even questioning sally and then has an informant ask sally to find him some meth and he will get her high.. charges sally with 1st degree sale, a charge punishable by 30 years imprisonment.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:13:49
Probably... and your probably the only one on the block with an old roof after a bad storm also
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:44:22
Haha - I try not to be dickish.. I have to really try because im a natural dick head and get myself in trouble. And im sorry if I ever knocked on your door also :) I will forever be trying to avoid the house of jtsnau
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:34:11
These police effectively turned a vulnerable addict into a full fledged cartel member just like that. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:18:26
Well thats why I make what I make.. normally im not knocking on your door unless you have recently had a bad storm and potentially have damage. Where I simply offer a free inspection. You would be surprized how many full roofs ive replaced because of one missing shingle or siding because of a few dents.. im good at what I do and the people who dont open the door. Well them guys normally have their same old crappy roof the next season after everyone in the neighborhood has gotten a new one
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:01:43
Fraud?? Hell no man. Never. Fraud would be filing a false claim . Way different buddy. The insursnce companies dont pay mme to replace roofs based on fraud. More less my knowledge on policies. Read your policy. Bet you cant underdtand it. Ask your agent (who is only an insurance salesman) to explain all the small text ha. Never fraud. Not even once.. funny u say fraud I just am like hey insurance buy this roof with a missing shingle and they pay us to do it and thats fraud???
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:05:24
I Love how going to the authorities here in America has consequences. . Go Murica. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:23:22
Ha :) I do not insult but normally thats how it goes.  And normally the roofs I replace look fine.  Hail isnt prejudice niether is wind. And especially after hailstorms if someones roof isnt leaking they think they are good. I get the insurance to buy a new roof. Normally have to do a buch of run around and matching materials but in the end of the day im helping homeowners and I have a smile on my face and make alot of money.. and you can take your piss attitude and old roof and piss off
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:40:43
Simply because their roofing materials are discontinued and you can no longer replace one or two shingles without their 10000 dollar investment now being worth about $2000 mismatch.. thats why
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:11:53
Fraud would be me causing damage and then filing a claim. Seriously,  finish high school kid. Look up the job title public adjuster... might learn something
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:32:27
I have never done fraud or deceit. What I do is the contrary and protect the homeowner from the insurance companies own fraud
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:51:32
In the insurance companies defense that black really looks like that blue that your car is so we're just going to go buy the black one because its cheaper.. Nevermind the premium you pay. And your home is your biggest investment. If your paying $1500 a year for insurance and they write the policy and I just know how to read it. Id say no lack of integrity. I wish you the best. I hope you learned something other than me being  dishonest ass
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:29:26
Good for you! I bet you got at least a few interested in bitcoin!   There is a reason why people go door to door and it is because it works. And you have balls - most people wont even consider knocking on doors for anything
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:02:22
Never said I was a hero buddy. Figuring ive helped homeowners get over a million dollars that was rightfully owed to them. Id say im doing pretty good. Your only defense is you hate door knockers.. in which case I shake hands say goodbye and go on my way. Sorry I interupted your macaroni dinner
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:51:42
I have never one time had an insurance company honor a persons full claim unless its pointed out. I have integrity and am honest. My experience is such that I can pretty much determine if they will or will not pay for the damage before they even come out and save the insurance companies a trip to the homeowners house in cases where they have no/not enough to meet deductable damage.. where am I in the wrong and can you please point it out?  Im sorry but when your car gets wrecked would you settle for a blue panel on your black car? Homeowners do it all the time because they have no clue otherwise.. I will continue to do my job with pride, integrity, an honestly.  Also just a pointer if you have homeowbers insurance make sure and pay the 100 bucks a year for a matching rider if its not built into your policy. It can save a huge headache in the future. I wish you the best in whatever you do

Here you go. Edutcate yourself. Dont like my links? Find ypur own. Or just be a sheep
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:31:54
Even door knockers hate door knockers.

Altho most countries don't have the incarceration rate of citizens as we do
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:22:01
Reworded - you would be amazed how often the insurance companies tell homeowners that their two missing shingles doesn't meet your deductible when in reality they're too missing shingles can never be replaced so in fact there replacement coverage kicks in. I simply pointing out the facts stated in the policy to the insurance company and they pay for whats owed.  I explained that in this thread already. Also I have to many downvotes can only answer every 10 mins now :(
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:08:28
I make my living by knocking on unsuspecting peoples doors :) and a pretty damn good living at that
Edit:  TIL bitcoiners especially hate door knockers :) sorry guys but I gotta keep knockin when it pays this much but I wish ya all the best
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:44:51
