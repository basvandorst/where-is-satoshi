Some of the isps require justification, normally why you can't use NAT. But for /29 they generally don't care.

Used to work for a network equipment manufacturer in the UK, when they want fire suppression in the lab they go for Inergen. Apparently still fire suppression but still breathable unlike halon. I understand it's not cheap though

This isn't their problem. They didn't make or supply the hardware or a lot of the software that runs on it. XYZ 3rd party's failure to futureproof or supply compatible software is not for MS to worry about.


You're assuming that the entire UK government is covered by the agreement, that the entire UK government is running on XP, and that every one of those employees uses a computer regularly, all aren't necessarily true.


And they'll say "tough, it's out of support, talk to the hardware vendor".


That's a massive claim to make without any evidence. Meanwhile, it's easy to find MS's written policy on support of older products.


I'm talking about a company that is similar in stature, size and recognition as MS - and the household name in its sector. The most significant customers spend billions with them in a heartbeat. Still doesn't change the fact that there's an end of support date - they've rightly recognised that it's a PITA to support every software release and hardware platform they've ever released, so they draw the line somewhere.

I meant entirely voluntary in the sense that the ISPs do not have to install filters of any kind. From the customer perspective, the more recent filters are not strictly opt out.  You have to decide one way or the other, before you are allowed onto the Internet. 
As for what some of parliament wants to do,  that does not reflect the current situation and may not reflect the future (it's not entirely certain that any necessary legislation will pass). 
As for the EFF,  your comment is the first I have heard of them being blocked,  deliberately or otherwise. Do you have a source? (but there is the argument that the filter should possibly be filtering stuff that prevents you from getting around the filter, regardless of whether it is mandatory,  voluntary, opt in,  opt out,  ISP operated,  installed on local machine or whatever)

Some like virgin media were never really his. He had a small shareholding but really it was an entirely separate company paying virgin to licence their brand and to wheel out Branson as a figurehead occasionally. 
The company did this because their own brands had been tarnished through shit customer service, and they already operated a small virgin branded ISP, so they just used it for the whole company.

This is changing though - some banks are looking at IP over DSL over a private network (worked at a hardware supplier that was involved in testing it for them).
It's not "the internet", but dial-up and ISDN is on the way out.

Any of the smaller providers usually provide them by default or by request. Some even give you an entire IP subnet.

A socket on a wall is in itself pretty meaningless. It doesn't mean that it is connected to an ethernet switch, or that it is, but the port is disabled. Not much of an attack opportunity in those cases. Or even if it is connected to an enabled port, they could be using 802.1x.

Why would they go through the effort to drain someone's account if they can't profit from it, and where it can be quickly reversed? 
Personally I notice quickly whether stuff is happening to my account that shouldn't be happening.  I sometimes question stuff that is obviously legitimate. Perhaps not everyone is this way but unless you are rich you should notice if your balance is not what it should be and that you appear to have lots of direct debit that didn't exist before. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:43:15
The direct debit guarantee provides for that, if I remember correctly. It is painless to get any money refunded.
Direct debit isn't available to everyone anyway, usually only for large businesses that require regular payments like charities and utility companies. An attacker could sign you up to a charity or something but they can't use it to shovel money into their account. 
Typically it will be obvious anyway, all of the major banks list who has direct debit agreements against your account on their online banking.

I've heard of ISPs like Plusnet (and possibly Zen) requiring you to fill out forms with proper justification, network diagrams, the works, at least for larger subnets.
IPv6 is great but it's still not totally useful when a lot of the internet is v4 only. Even in the UK the number of ISPs with IPv6 is support is small and limited to fairly niche ISPs.

It'd be nice if other government departments effortlessly managed to understand technical subjects.

Both of those ideas are entirely voluntary. Labour pushed for the child porn filters but it never got anywhere. 
The court ordered blocking of a few sites does piggyback on the child porn filters that a few ISPs have, although the government never asked for those blocks.

"we report, you decide" was / still is Fox News' slogan. 
So apt.

Why not? There will be parts of the company that made money, which helped to reduce the loss of the overall company. Shouldn't they get a bonus because they/their department did a good job?
It's the bonuses for CEOs and those who have failed that are the real problem.

He advertises in a UK political satirical magazine a lot, often saying how cheap he is compared to Savile Row and how you don't need to buy some poorly fitting cheap suit when you can go to him.

Again, the official line is that no, they won't support it until the end of time. They want you pay for a new OS and support contracts on that. 
Supporting XP forever won't be free for them and not worth the bother. This is why the support fees are eyewatering (the UK government has paid 5.5 million pounds for *one year of support*) and why they want to see evidence of a migration plan first - they're doing it to get people to switch, not because they want money from supporting an ancient OS. MS doesn't want another Internet Explorer 6.


Yes. They'll tell you to use that blank cheque to buy whatever current version of Windows is on sale and then come back to them - even if you need to buy thousands of licences. It's totally wrong to assume that they'll do anything for money.
I worked for a similar huge company with a similar support system. If you went to them with an ancient, out-of-support piece of hardware or unsupported firmware version, they'll tell you to go away until you upgrade. It doesn't matter how big you are or how much you will pay. If you're a very important customer they might have offered a nice discount on newer equipment I guess.

If oil was such a panacea, it wouldn't be Salmond himself trying to calm people down - he seems to think that Scotland will walk into the EU (despite the likes of Barroso saying that he doesn't agree) and that the UK will beg for a currency union (nope). Don't forget the whole problem of the UK debt that Scotland should really get its fair share of.
Plus there are companies that will seriously consider moving south. That's not scaremongering.

But you're going to have to buy a new terminal anyway given the impending EMV introduction in the US. Since EMV isn't new I'd be surprised if those terminals cost substantially more.
Outside the US, EMV is ubiquitous, NFC is gaining popularity

As an RBS customer before and after the credit crunch, I haven't lost a penny (our equivalent of the FDIC didn't need to step in) and I wouldn't be too worried about keeping my money there. Apart from a post-crunch IT meltdown (due to outsourcing mainframe work to poorly trained Indian staff) I didn't lose access to my money for a second. In return for the bailout, the government owns a large stake in RBS.
That's rather different to Gox, don't you think?
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:38:24
The XP non-embedded extended support is extremely expensive, escalates over the next couple of years and you have to prove to MS that you have a migration plan before they'll let you on it. It's designed for people not to be able to use it as an alternative to moving off the 13 year old OS.

The public WiFi is tunnelled/VPN to a BT server and as has been said, needs a login that is attached to an account.
Anyone asking BT who was responsible will get back the details of that account and not the that of the router's owner.

You can opt out. It's just that it doesn't always go through. Whether that's malicious or incompetence is anyone's guess. 
You can also use your own equipment and avoid the problem altogether

In terms of the Internet, there are only a few ISPs that would have anything close that could be used for "censorship".

Sometimes they go too far though, like buyers who have clearly done something fraudulent but eBay doesn't care and won't help the seller out. Being motivated by selling/value fees/paypal fees doesn't help here
Plus they've done other things to screw over sellers like not allowing them to leave anything other than positive feedback while buyers can still do what they want.
Unfortunately eBay's popularity and near monopoly means nothing will change.
