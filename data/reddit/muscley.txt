Love this project.
Here is a friendly suggestion for logo and website layout:
Keep up the great work.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:41:31
Still confusing... Maybe the first visual representation of crypto should be the Bitcoin logo at the top with arrows coming out from it, then list the other crypto you can trade it for.
Also, please do not START with bcash, maybe Ethereum or LTC, to remove further confusion.
Thanks, so excited for your excellent work.

Landing page inadvertantly promoting bitcoin.com with the pen...
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:48:12
I'm vegetarian... this works.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:08:20
Quite good. I kept watching for 20 minutes!
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:10:54
Ok, surely. But it's literally a promotional pen advertising bitcoin.com!

I've been in the game since the $200s and have always been on the BTC side..but recently some TrashCash threads had me interested. This text cleared everything up in one easy today read blurb. Thankyou.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:22:15
Just make sure the add says bitcoin.org!!

Please add BTC stats.. current price/how much to raise/ % towards goal..? Not sure if you own this site.

Looks like the mem pool is being emptied every so often, but I'm wondering why my 1sat/b transaction is not confirming..?

Maybe a breakdown of electrical use based appliance/room/family member.
Curious as to what other advantages would come from this...?

The bitcoin payment on overstock is abysmal! Amazon can do better.

Ahh, I see, ok. Thankyou for the explanation! Currently using Mycelium..I may want to rethink this..
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:25:43
This method will eventually fuck you. I go to some lengths to use VPN, hardened browsers, etc, and this method of ID goes against this all. I do nothing illegal, I just value my privacy!

I like this. I'd love to see an integrated site where you can pick a charity to contribute to.
Ps every time I think of UNICEF I think of the tiny orange box with string handle that I got as a small student and then was instructed to go around asking people for coins. This is the nerdy adult version of this!

Why move the coins there? Also, what about mycelium?

Let's get this shit rolling! Very exciting news.

How would they make profits? Mining? Lending?
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:52:12
Good point hmm
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:58:31
This really was very easy to understand!
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:20:10
Explain or link?? Thanks

Bought mine a few weeks ago and still waiting for it to ship from overseas. How about we send some of these to the US warehouse? -_-
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:35:46
Is there a blacklist of common ips?
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:16:14
No, no.. Apples and Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:34:27
This looks interesting. A lot of Privacy centered applications floating up to the surface! 
You could essentially send coins to yourself = a tumble. Has anyone done this?
I like the idea of transferring coins "taint-free".

Coinbase allows me to purchase BTC at any moment with my bank account. BTC price at purchase is locked in.
With Gemini it seems I must have USD already in my Gemini account at the time I wish to buy BTC...
Can somebody please confirm or correct me?
