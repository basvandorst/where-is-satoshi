IF it damages BTC, which IIRC, is still uncertain.  It could potentially save BTC if the other side of the debate is correct.
I personally don't care because as a user, I have no power here, I just buy and spend.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:32:27
CPUs == ASICs in most context.  Basically hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:01:56


Unfortunately, this brings us back to square 1, where SegWit/LN will never activate because the demand for larger blocks outpaces the demand for shrinking tx sizes and it would still need 95%.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:02:30
Exchanges don't matter... they will support the victor no matter what.
F2Pool hurts the BU side of things, but with miners, I suspect they'll also "get in line" so to speak.
As for not enough support, from where I see it, Bitcoin Core has an even harder problem.  I suspect SegWit will never activate given the 95% requirement, which means that if BU didn't win, Core isn't going anywhere either.
Likewise, one could say there will never be enough support for Core either since it requires 95% to activate SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:42:33
This... doesn't matter?  Right nor BU BTC and BC BTCs have no real separate value.  That only comes into play after a potential HF, right?
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:58:08


Why would that matter?  Just wondering.
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:28:27
It won't last much longer... I don't think anyone likes the status quo, and at the end of the day, the miners have the power to force the issue.  The question is: do their opponents concede peacefully?  Or do they try and take the BTC down out of spite?  I hope the HF will be so quick (&lt;1 week) that there might not be time to for any real shenanigans.  
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:30:47


Utility drives user growth, therefor value is defined by users.  The US Dollar is valuable because billions of people use it and assign value to it.  It's a safe store of wealth and can be used as money.
Bitcoin pricing out users hurts its utility and value.


You can have 5 billionaires putting their money into it, or 5 billion people, the end result is the same.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:39:04
Exactly.  All this fighting is pointless.  No one here really had any power to do anything unless you have the hashpower.  Your support for one "thing" over the other "thing" is irrelevant.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:41:42
But that's not true with all nations, right?  A miner in China doesn't need to comply with US FINCEN?
Regardless, the question I had was why an HF would be relevant to miners needing to do KYC?  Wouldn't that be the case on either side of the blockchain debate?
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:49:51
WTF is wrong with you?  How is a currency supposed to be mass adopted when it's out of reach of the poorest world residents?  You want the poor folks in India, South America, and Africa to take up Bitcoin, because more users = more value.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:15:28
By what metric did BU lose?  Just curious.  Did something happen to make people decide this?  Or was this just a few tweets?
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:36:35
Why do exchanges matter?  They're merely money-changers.  They'll handle whatever the "winner" is if they want to keep in business.  Doesn't it come down to holders and miners?  
(sorry I'm new)
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:53:10


I think this is going to happen regardless given the increased difficulties in mining BTC though.  The reason these big mining pools exist is to pool the resources and improve efficiency.  
Delaying big-blocks may make that happen faster, but it's going to happen regardless.
IMO, that's potential problem  of BTC, we're on real problem  let's figure this scaling debate first, then worry about the other things later.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:48:36
Well, the other thing is that running a BU node opens yourself up to a DDOS attack... so there is that.  It's a bit unfair to use node-counts when you have a bunch of assholes playing unfair.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:43:20


Which it isn't going to get any time soon.
@_date: 2017-03-31 14:39:36
Exactly.  Why do I care what these fuckheads think?  This whole debate is going to be resolved one way or another through the math behind the coin.  Whether that means the miners all decide to HF and make the blocks bigger, or enough nodes get SegWit activated.
Everything else is just an autistic slapfight.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:30:31


How big is this problem right now anyways?
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:41:39
Isn't this a feature?  Not a bug?  I thought Bitcoin was to be decentralized where developers don't run the show (or are needed to keep things moving).
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:06:47
Nodes would still be important during and after the hard-fork.  Mining bigger blocks shouldn't change that at all.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:48:58
Miners have all the CPU power, and in the world of BTC, that's all that matters.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:06:20
Forks aren't the end of things... If Bitcoin forks, it means Core lost and therefor the path forward is BU.  This doesn't mean the end of things like Lightning or SW either.  It just means that BTC got it's priorities straight: remove the stupid 1mb limit first, then focus on other tasks.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:31:45
[There is a solution where you don't need every node to be a full node.](  IIRC, even the whitepaper specified that full-nodes were mainly going to end up being specialized entities like the mining concerns became.


I don't think it would be a drastic change.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:02:38
SegWit cannot happen any other way without the 95% threshold.  You can't just change the rules because it's not working.
Major support is irrelevant as well, none of those stakeholders have any real power.  All that matters is the CPUs.  The miners hold that.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:17:43
But why would miners, pushing a big-block fork, do such a thing?  That's not in their interest.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:01:16
I mean, it's all autistic screeching as far as I'm concerned.  The solution is binary:
1.  Segwit will eventually hit activation threshold (IIRC, that's still 95% signaling)
2.  Miners will just conduct a 75% attack (or even 51%) and the great HF will occur
The question is, which is more likely to happen first?  Followed quickly by: will the losers fall into line?  Or will they get emotional about the whole thing?  
At the end of the day, I want to believe we all want BTC to rise in value and utility regardless of the path chosen... so I really hope we don't have a sore loser problem should either path be taken.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:40:24
Again, it's dependent on your perspective.  If you support big-blocks, a 51% vote settles the debate of on-chain scaling.  The minority chain atrophies and everyone moves to the new chain.
If you're a Core supporter, it's an attack because you already believe block size is too large and want to attack the issue of scaling differently.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:30:12


Again, the miners lead, followed by users, followed by exchanges.
I don't know why people think glorified banks matter here...


Who is calling it that?  AFAIC there is no such thing a BTU right now.


Who cares about them?  They have their own interests at play.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:28:15


So what matters?  
* Number of nodes, which can be faked?
* The economic majority? Whatever that may be?
* Hashpower?
* Reddit upvotes in one of two circlejerk chambers?
* Twitter spats?
Who's keeping score here?
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:31:00
In a sense, I agree, this whole fight is really down to a spat between developers and miners... both have their own respective echo chambers.  Both are unwilling to be convinced to concede.  Everyone else is just a spectator.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:28:24
Right.... Because he's the only one? 
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:26:11
This presumes most miners support BU because they use ASICBoost, which is not entirely true.  Some may do that, but many others simply don't like that a glorified developer is trying to make changes with 0 stake in the game.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:59:06
We'll see.  Are you gonna put your money where your mouth is?
@_date: 2017-04-13 03:27:45
I don't think so since no one uses LTC... but whatever.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:01:39
I am.  Wanna know what I learned?  You don't matter.  I don't matter.  This isn't a democracy.  Owning BTCs doesn't give you fuck-all of an opinion.  Exchanging BTCs for fiat and back again gives you no real power.  Writing code for a BTC node?  Who cares what you think.
Why should any of these stakeholder yield any power?  They have no stake in this beyond seeing the value of BTC rise.  Guess who else has those same stakes?  Oh yeah... *the miners.*
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:49:51
Bingo.  
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:28:52
I beg to differ here, since October 2016 to now, BTC's price has gone up considerably as well as BU signaling.  In fact, the only verifiable drop in BTC price had more to do with the denial of the ETF than anything else.
So BU signaling either had a positive impact on price, or no impact at all.  I'm leaning towards the latter.
@_date: 2017-04-05 01:57:23
Likewise when the BU nodes orphan the SW ones and take the hashrate with it.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:26:26


Which had more to do with the ETF news than anything else.  The price drop happened on the 15th, ETF rejected on the 10th, AntPool signaled on the 7th.  Get your dates right.


A lot of your argument was par for the course for the typical BU vs. SW/LN things.  Clearly, you're biased here.


LOL, why don't you click the link to where you blatantly admit it could've all been coincidence?
Truth hurts eh?
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:30:03
You don't need replay protection if the minority chain is destroyed.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:29:36
Again, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: *who cares?*  I'm tired of these he/she said twitter posts like these people's opinions matter.  Or, for that matter, your (or mine) opinion matters.
Bitcoin isn't a democracy.  Democracy sucks, it means asshats with no clue of what's going on have a voice.  It also means cults of personality reign supreme.  
BTC is all about the math.  This whole debate will be settled by math.  Whether that means enough signaling for SW/LN or BU or a successful 51% attack which kills a minority chain.  It'll be over and nothing you or I did will have changed it because the powers involved are beyond that of the average user.
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:09:27
Depends.  If you're a big blocker, SW isn't really innovative. Smaller coins can get away with beta testing new features and stuff because they're worthless.  No one cares enough about them.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:54:10


Fair, and I would agree... if the BTC community didn't divide itself into two concurrent circle jerks.  At that point, discussion just becomes moot and people end up hearing what they want to hear.  
Maybe if these asshats got off Twitter and sat the fuck down and talked like adults, we wouldn't be in this mess from the get go.  But no, I suspect various egos on both sides are preventing this.
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:58:48
They also have the power to not mine segwit blocks, and they can also choose to mine bigger blocks.
Users can go on reddit and cry about it or blow their money on altcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:22:54
uacomment is also signaling for UASF?  Or is the grey saying "unknown"?
This graph sucks.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:20:06
Core can activate SegWit whenever they want, but then it would be a failure.  It's essentially rage-quitting.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:48:00


Plenty of shitcoins have "innovations", but that's because they're tiny and nobody cares about them.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:35:05


Maybe instead of blithely circle-jerking in your respective echo-chambers you admit that the current solution-set simply is not sufficient and start from scratch.
You should reject both options and clamor for a new consensus.
Or... watch a 51% attack happen.  Or a UASF.


No one in that world wants to have a discussion.  Blockstream has it's opinions and solution set, BU has theirs.  Both are being hard-headed to the detriment of the rest of us.
So while these people kinda matter, it's all bullshit until they sit down and figure this out like adults.  Except instead of pressuring them to do that, we're all sitting here preaching the cult of Satoshi or clamoring for Fix A or Fix B.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:23:01


Doesn't the whitepaper basically discuss the opposite?  Satoshi basically knew that BTC would grow beyond mining using GPUs and home-brew rigs to server farms dedicated to the task.  Same with running Nodes.  Ideally miners were supposed to run the Nodes, as well as anyone who had enough BTC business who wanted to improve their tx security.
Mining centralization is not an issue because, as I've said in the past, the miners themselves don't always agree.  To flip this entire post on it's head: *If miner centralization were a problem, why haven't they HF'ed already?*
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:42:21
...and miners will remind them who has all the cards.  
I don't understand why exchanges matter here, they should just stay out of this debate, it doesn't involve them, and they're pretty much the BTC equivalent of banks.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:58:53
What article?
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:20:47


I think the thing we're both missing is the PBoC ruling which let Chinese exchanges like BTCC to begin withdrawing after the 15th.  Three largest exchanges in one of the most populous nations on earth sitting on peoples' money for a month?  The kind of FUD there would see a big withdrawal.
That combined with the ETF news, yeah, makes sense.
Oh wells, live and learn.


I think we're done here.  Relax, you'll live longer.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:42:26
Not all ATMs or exchanges have committed as your list shows.  Once the fork begins, most plan to sit it out until the dust settles anyways.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:23:57


I hate to say it, but it just comes across as another pump and dump.  LTC will go back down once the fervor is over.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:23:09
If we're going to make those correlations, then it would appear BU's slow but steady rise over the last few months has helped the price far more than segwit... even though correlation != causation 
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:26:46
I do.  I just find this slapfight amusing because everyone is so fucking sure of themselves on their side of the line.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:47:23
Math is the underlying principal behind BTC.  The whole point was to rise above this politicization commonly associated with governments and fiat currency by relying on a combination of hashpower and nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:31:06
This is a good thing then, because it avoids a protracted battle between Core and BU.  Core can't win, BU can't win, time to break the stalemate somehow and end this fight.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:49:30
Nope.  Just not enough will take that chance.  UASF isn't popular among them.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:02:59
Who cares?  If 55,000 nodes activated segwit, the remaining running non-Core will just take up the slack.  Nodes mean nothing.
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:23:24
Technically speaking: isn't the "economic majority" of BTC in this case the banks?  Exchanges move money between BTC and fiat, for instance and would effectively regulate all tx's.  They also have all upside and no downside in this argument.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:57:53










Yes, both those groups... Because clearly a fix needs to happen for a problem that's been around what? 1 year? 2 years now?
The only solution now is the UASF or HF, and even they have issues.


"No one cares about BU"... if that were true we'd still have one subreddit for BTC and not two, hahahaha


BTC is working great... then what are we fixing again?  Oh yeah, the longer tx times and higher fees... 
Every day you resist means one more day the problem isn't resolved.  The same is true for the BU side as well.  Solution is to come together and admit that neither is effective in addressing the issue.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:33:56
Right, but they have grey for unknown too.  I see it now on the left side, but it's a poor choice for colors.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:41:06


Not really.  They have no power, remember?
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:23:35
Even Core's roadmap agreed to a blocksize growth... the difference is 2-4mb versus 50mb.  It's possible.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:14:29
So I took the time to read your links, because I'm not a sockpuppet (fake account made by a 3rd party to advocate on it's behalf) or a troll (because you'd know if I was trolling you)...
1.  Your window of analysis is too narrow to draw any conclusive claims (days/hours)
2.  Plenty of other, larger, issues were happening in March (ETF?)
3.  If you're going to correlate data about BTC price to BU signaling, it needs to go all the way back to OCT2016.  Since that date though, BTC has risen considerably in lock-step with the increase in blocks mines (per last 1000).  The only irregularities last month had more to do with the impact of the ETF decision.
4.  Following the brief dip to the $900 range, BTC has been rising strongly, especially with news of Japanese acceptance.
All in all, there is nothing conclusive to support your assertion.  [On top of that, you've even admitted it here.](
Maybe you should take a lesson here: BTC is too volatile to make short term assumptions based on hourly movement.  Most experts seem to believe in a 100/200 day moving window average due to that.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:02:33
Yes.  Pretty sure.  Run through the different scenarios where hodlers or exchanges try to leverage any changes on the BTC ecosystem and you'll see they don't matter.
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:49:19
...and UASF is somehow less risky?
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:25:31
Sigh... again, so what?  I'm not arguing if it's happening or it's not (even if they are speculation and allegation), I just don't see what's wrong with it.  Smart people work smart, not hard.
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:31:18
Don't listen to him.  Even if 90% of nodes reject oversized blocks, the remaining 10% will gladly run them.  It's not a capacity issue either, you don't need a ton of nodes to keep BTC going.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:31:28
No... they don't.  You do realize the vast majority of people don't live here on Reddit and Twitter right?  It's like during 2016 all over again.  These little slapfights mean nothing because decisions like these are made by people who have real power... whether it be the economic majority or the miners or both.
This conflict will not be resolved by upboats.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:22:57


...and here we go.  


Yepp.  We're done here.


So either you pay a larger fee and get your tx faster, or pay less and it takes longer... or did I miss a beat there?
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:37:24
Bingo.  
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:07:48
Then we're back to square one...  I support hashpower-based governance because it divests us from the current bullshit of every asshole with a twitter handle giving their opinion... like they fucking matter.  Like fuck all these people out there.  I don't care if they were coding Bitcoin Core, or run an exchange, or have a million BTC.  Fuck them all.
If you want an opinion, open a mining pool.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:04:31
Looks to me that growth has stalled? 
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:29:42
The vast majority of users outside of Twitter and Reddit don't really care about this debate.  Most will just go along with whatever happens.  But the exchanges will ultimately wait.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:32:17


No miner can possibly control 75% of the hashrate.  The economic conditions of doing so would preclude that.


Because you're making a false assumption: that there are few miners and they all agree lock-step all the time.


And how many nodes are out there?  If 95% of nodes UASF, the other 5% will just cover for them.
What power do the nodes really have?
You're crazy if you think UASF is a rational path forward.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:37:21
Your own link shows plenty of sites that are either ready for both segwit/BU, or BU.
You also know that many exchanges, upon commencement of a fork, will suspend operations until a clear winner emerges.  Coinbase for instance, said they would wait it out.  Others would go with the majority chain.
So even then, being segwit ready or supportive, means nothing because they'll all play wait and see.
Problem with UASF, is that it's in no one's interest to be the first mover.  Exchanges have too much to lose, miners will get mad, etc.
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:28:36
But if only half the nodes switch, the others take up the slack.  Consensus through the node network is hard to enforce.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:24:38
Nodes validate the blockchain, and even if 80% of the nodes took themselves off the board in support of a UASF, then the other 20% would handle the load easily.
Users have no power beyond converting fiat into BTC and making the value grow.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:39:45


....and that's a crapshoot.  You can't possibly account for that given BTC's day-to-day variability.


Tanking in response?  *Checks BTC price for the last month*, where?


I did, 4 of them talked about how the down-vote button wasn't for disagreements.


No one cares about LTC pump and dump.


I did... first one distinctly had you admit that it was all coincidental.  You can't even back it up yourself.
It's a nice talking point, but the price history since you made your claims a few weeks ago seems to validate my claim that there is little to no correlation to BU surging or not.
In fact, the claim you can make is: *a protracted battle over on-chain scalability* is more important to BTC price than either solution winning out.  Hodlers just want an end to this little civil war here, they probably don't care who wins as long as the solution is achieved.  BU can "win" tomorrow and BTC can shoot up in price because apprehension about *how* an HF, SF, UASF would go about would be over, letting people get back to the business of using BTC as a currency/hold of value.
I can draw that same conclusion from the data you presented if I really wanted to.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:34:06
Until it turns out the vast majority of the BTC economy switched to the coin with less hashpower on the shortest chain.  Read up on a 51% attack and you'll see the users can have their chain killed off in a matter of days.  With 75%, the majority chain will win out in *hours*.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:13:06
Yeah.  So what?  Users activate their own fork without miners backing it.... lose their money and die off. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:22:20


This is a twisting of the term "decentralization".  All it means for BTC is that it's not governed by one central authority.
Even then, even today, we don't see all the mining pools/people agreeing.  But if they do all agree that BU is the way to go, then so be it.


Fuck the users.  I don't want a democracy.  Democracy is stupid and dominated by stupid people and cults of personality.  I see it here and there when people quote one assholes twitter versus another.  


How about a 75% attack?  What then?  Your POW change on a measly weak chain is like re-arranging deck chairs on a sinking ship.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:18:36


Nothing stopping Segwit/LN from happening after removing the block size limit... Just sayin'


Not true.  Miners want BTC to be valuable over the long term as well.  Also, no one miner can really control all the hashpower, so the decentralization thing is just another boogeyman here.
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:52:40


Only if they make a bone-headed decision to only accept one over the other ahead of any potential fork.  Which again makes me wonder why they would take that risk?
Right now, all exchanges should continue doing business as usual.  If/when a re-org happens, just wait out the few hours/days until one chain wins, and continue with that as BTC.  Done.  Not my fault exchanges want to put themselves and their users at risk by playing part in a debate they have no fucking say in.


Sure... we'll see how a bunch of nobodies throw their BTCs into the trash with a UASF.  That'll be fun. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:08:22
If you think this whole debate is over, you'll be sorely disappointed.
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:53:22
They make it easier, yes, but there are other methods of acquiring BTC.   
Again, they have no cards to hold.  Taking such a risk is silly on their part and would regret it.
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:44:04
Understood.  I'm just saying UASF is about as risky as EC all things considered.  
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:11:17
How about this: you make it so the interest of those governing BTC line up with those hodling/using BTC.  You also make it so that people investing in the governance of BTC have some real stakes in the process by owning expensive equipment and needing to recoup their investments.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:41:23
I don't see why people keep complaining about this... really getting annoying.
@_date: 2017-04-15 19:50:18
If I had a 100 Satoshi every time someone said this... 
@_date: 2017-04-03 21:18:03
Again, there are plenty of BU/Classic nodes that can pick up the slack if you opt out.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:19:17


Sure... If your really believe that.  I don't.  So I'll sit and see how the UASF experiment works.

They may not benefit from high mining fees (miners benefit there), but they benefit from fees charged in selling BTC.  They need to make money to keep the lights on too.

Okay, that example was your typical peon.  But what about a larger organization with more resources?
Like a state-actor (USA or China?) or a company backed with significant financial resources?


Because node counts don't really matter?  IIRC, BU is focused mainly through PoW/Hashpower where it's currently winning.  


Again, if you have 5000 nodes supporting UASF, but 1000 supporting the OG chain, with backing from miners and some exchanges, why would those 5000 nodes matter?
Running a UASF node is a huge risk to the person doing it, especially if they have their own BTC at stake.

@_date: 2017-05-23 20:15:16
Coming from the big-blocker side, I never was against Segwit.  I was against Segwit as a substitution for a block size increase.
I personally don't believe SW, on it's own, is a sufficient technical solution to 1mb blocks being filled up, nor is it sufficient to deter centralization by miners (this will happen regardless).  
I wanted the best of both worlds: Segwit + 2mb HF/BIP100.  We get SW, and we get a clear-cut signalling apparatus to raise the blocksize as needed.
Core fucked this up.  The easiest thing they could've done was picked one of the thousand HF big block solutions out there and swallowed one to get Segwit rolled out.
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:57:26


Only if you refuse to open your eyes and ears to the obvious solution (removing the 1mb limit) and embracing the various paths forward.


So... no longer Bitcoin then?  Got it.
"Easy to implement", "trivial" LOL.  We'll see a block-size increase before we see POS, it's such a non-starter it's not worth pursuing.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:21:51
Well that's the point I made initially.  All this FUD about centralization with BU is just as true with SW.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:13:23


Feature, not a bug.  User driven forks are even more easily manipulated using nodes than mining or any other method of signaling.
What would stop the Chinese gov't from spooling up 5 million BTC nodes with whatever they want?
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:27:06
I don't have to write it, apparently this agreement is going to produce just that.


Since the economic majority is represented here, the ball is effectively in Core's court.
If the exchanges and miners run a custom protocol, rolling out a Segwit SF, then committing to an HF at a given block height, they will get what they want, regardless of what folks running an altcoin node want.

@_date: 2017-05-08 17:47:33

@_date: 2017-05-06 02:07:05


Not everyone runs a full node.  But nothing about bigger blocks prevents this.


Reckless how?  Everyone always says this, but implementing Bip100 is a measured way to grow the block size using established consensus rules.
As for doing it... I'm signaling for that.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:02:17


Network latency is an issue that goes away as the third world modernizes.  With BIP100, the growth of block sizes will easily keep pace with that.
Same with CPU/RAM.  That shit is always getting cheaper.  Today we have more than enough capacity to do this.
Your arguments are weak if that's all you have.  Especially since BTC becomes more valuable, shelling out a few hundred USD on a better PC/network becomes cheap by comparison.


A problem which will go away as faster wireless comes online.  If BIP100 were rolled out today, you wouldn't see 4mb overnight.  The fastest you'd get there is 435 days approximately, assuming 75% hashpower signals for larger blocks every difficulty period (they won't).
Assuming you max blocksize every difficulty period, you'll hit the 32mb limit in 1080 days approx, but this would probably be much longer in practice (because 75% hashpower needs to signal each difficulty period to lock in a 5% increase).
SegWit will never fucking happen on BTC though.  Not until block sizes are uncapped.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:22:50
If that's the case then why the fuck are you people still here?  Go use LTC and stop making this bullshit happen on BTC.

Why do you hate free markets?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:38:35
But nothing concrete.  Even the explanation for why ASICBoost is not enabled in all Bitmain miners is clear-cut due to patent infringements in different countries.
So basically, Bitmain admits it has ASICBoost (nothing wrong there), doesn't enable it an all versions (patent infringement), that's it.
There is no evidence of Covert ASICBoost being used... beyond which, seeing as Bitmain/Antpool reside in China, and they own the patent to ASICBoost there, why would they do so covertly?
It's also specious reasoning to presume ASICBoost as the reason for Bitmain to block Segwit **with no concrete evidence**.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:52:11
Again... seeing as they own the patent in China (or at least filed for it), why would they need to run it covertly?
The issue of running AB isn't at stake, it's this tinfoil hat theory that they need to do it covertly which is why they're blocking SW.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:05:15


Someone figures out how to do the work smarter instead of harder and they get hated for it.  Bitmain isn't the only one with ASICBoost, other miners have access to it too.
Regardless, if BTC goes down, you can say saonara to the entire CryptoMarket.  The only thing keeping shitcoins around is the hope that late-entrants can get on the next "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:08:06
Exchanges are technically hodlers too.  Don't forget that.
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:34:09
BIP100 implements a mechanism to increase blocksize.  75% hashpower in support of an increase in blocksize during a difficulty period signals an increase of 5% over the current block-size.
It's neat, it's simple, and phases in the growth of the block overtime.  If implemented today, we could be at 4mb in about 1.5 years (assuming 75% signal an increase in every difficulty period) with max block hitting in 3 years.
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:39:10
Yes, why wouldn't you want Paypal 2.0?  Paypal is immensely successful.  Why don't you Segwit types just go use LTC... Leave BTC alone, you don't use it anyways.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:33:38
I can turn that same argument around about miners as well... They don't all have to run Antminers or the same software...
In fact, there is more decentralization in mining than there is in the development of BTC clients.
Right now, the vast majority of nodes run one set of software.  That to me is a weakness in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:39:40
Exchanges are unreliable as fuck.  They can be replaced, hacked, and manipulated by state-actors.
So... why should I care about them?  BTC doesn't need exchanges to exist.

They're preventing a SegWit activation, not a block size increase, stop assuming both are one in the same.


I'll trust the miners over some glorified app developers.  Especially ones who can't even do something as simple as Stakeholder Analysis and Requirements Development.
But that's what you get with stubborn comp sci nerds.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:58:13
The issue here is that removing the 1mb cap on blocksize is the simplest, low-risk solution out there.  SegWit is far less proven and fundamentally alters the architecture of Bitcoin.
The thinking here is: remove the 1mb cap first, then, if that is not sufficient, explore other options.  After the removal of 1mb, there is still the 32mb limit to contend with.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:21:26
[As opposed to Blockstream which shares a number of developers in Core funded by a large financial institution like AXA?](

Sybil Attack is basically using a number of pseudonym accounts in order to show there is more support for something than there really is.


Hence why UASF is effectively a Sybil attack.  Since there is no way to verify (trust) nodes as a means of signaling, or even to update BTC, it serves to undermine the security features of this currency.
IIRC, that's why Satoshi tended to equate CPU/Hashpower with votes.

Nodes are bullshit clients these days.  Running a node adds 0 value to the network because you're not mining.
The miners run nodes and mine, they're the only ones who matter.


Idiot.  Miners run nodes too, which makes them far more valuable than the rest of you BIP148 losers.  The whole reason they matter and you don't is because they have all the power to re-order blocks and reject others while simultaneously mining more blocks.  Thus continually extending the proof of work
If you run a UASF mode you're gonna fork off into a minority chain and die.  You won't have the hashpower to maintain the longer PoW, so eventually the UASF fork will whither and die in hours.


So basically re-phrasing what I said... right.  Rejecting blocks is irrelevant without hashpower to back it up.


I can't wait for you lemmings to run off the cliff.  Please put all your BTC into your stupid BIP148 wallet so you can lose it all.  This Sybil attack will fail or destroy Bitcoin, it's effectively lose-lose.
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:33:58


A node serves 1 main role: it maintains a copy of the blockchain and acts as a peer to peer transmission system for transactions/blocks.  That's it.


August 1st, a bunch of morons are going to fork off the blockchain by accepting Segwit blocks in addition to current block configs.


Hey, you might be new to all this, but re-read the whitepaper and realize nodes=miners in that context.


No they do not.  Miners (aka guys who mine blocks and run nodes) do this.


You should re-read the white paper cuz you clearly lacked the skills to comprehend it.

Really?  Because last time I checked, 90% of nodes run Core... seems pretty "centralized" to me.  Hashpower among mining pools will never be fully centralized into one entity.  
Ironic that everyone here wants a Sybil attack on BTC to kill it's value.  If UASF succeeds on August 1st, BTC will die.  It will die because it will have been successfully "hacked" by an entity with 0 PoW, and that will undermine whatever value this currency ever had.  No one wants an insecure peer-to-peer cash system.

Core are a bunch of scam artists using propaganda and censorship to subvert any opposing opinion.
For one thing, they censor any mention of alternative Bitcoin clients like BU, XT, Classic, etc.  This is part of the Core ownership of what should be a subreddit dedicated to discussing all clients.
For another, they use easily identifiable sockpuppet accounts to promote their agenda, whatever that may be.  Plenty of "redditors for 3 weeks" around here, who only post about UASF.
Again, this is Sybil 101.  It's easy to cheat when you inflate your numbers and lie about it all, **which is why we use hashpower as the mechanism to signal change in the BTC ecosystem**.  Can't fake hashpower, but you can certainly fake twitter polls, node numbers, and other crap.

Are you that naive?  Some of the most prominent coders with commits to Core code are associated with BS.  Sure, they may not make up the lion-share of the developers, but to assume there is no undue influence from BS on Core is hypocritical given the same allegations leveled at Jihan and Roger Ver.
 &gt; I can't take anyone seriously who actually believes the 100+ active Core contributors = Blockstream. That's some next-level tinfoil hat nonsense.

95% of nodes are pointless if they don't mine blocks.  You're just maintaining a ledger.  The miners are the ones that write the next page.

@_date: 2017-05-22 16:51:50
To an extent.  But yes, you're essentially eating your currency at that point.  Your fee level basically sets the bottom unit of your currency.  
Since exchanges operate on a percentage basis, this is usually fixed.  Miners operate on a bid-based system where tx fees are ordered by whomever pays the most first.  But if blocks are full, then your supply of "tx space" is limited, and supply/demand would dictate the price of tx will always go up.
To be fair, even if SegWit were activated, it still wouldn't resolve the current problems either.  Not on it's own or with its paltry 2/4mb blocksize increase.  This is why I personally support BU/SW.  Remove the 1mb blocksize, and implement SW.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:13:05

Great, so after 6 months we can go back to the same BS plaguing BTC today...  


BIP100 is a solution to that.  75% signaling rate for each period between difficulty increases means a 5% increase on the current limit.  Much simpler and streamlined than SegWit.


Irrelevant.  I can be a national government and manipulate that take rate much easier than manipulating the hashpower.

Right now, we can remove the limit and go right up to 32mb!  That's plenty of on-chain scaling for the foreseeable future.  If an when that capacity is not enough, maybe then we think about Segwit! 
The only reason folks want SW activated now is FUD due to the idea that miners, given their bigger blocks, will simply never allow SW in the future.

Actually, states can't control hashpower, but they can control the nodes that BTC is run on.  
The most common thing we see is discussion about a UASF, something that would be incredibly easy for China or the US to accomplish if it so chooses to do so.  What's stopping the Chinese government from installing a custom node on every government computer and executing their own protocol?  Nothing.  There are only 7000 nodes out there, and the Chinese gov't probably has about 10 million PCs on its networks.  
It's much more difficult to control hashpower because in order to affect changes in the ecosystem, you need to control a substantial portion (&gt;75%) of the mining pools.  Problem is, as BTC becomes more valuable, it becomes more profitable worldwide to mine it, which means more entry into mining, which makes it harder for a state actor to influence the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:26:20
UASF is never going to be safe.  If Bitcoin Core can use it to fork the chain, what's to stop a malicious state-actor from doing the same?
If all that matters is who owns the majority of nodes, then the Chinese gov't can basically own BTC through in through.
Hashpower is harder to fake and even harder to manipulate.  Implement BIP100 and we'd be over all this already.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:16:44
That argument is so fucking spent.  Bitcoin will either be centralized to the developers (core) or miners.  Except miners have an incentive to maintain value in the end.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:55:07
Okay, so hear me out: why would Bitmain (or Antpool more specifically) need to run ASICBoost covertly?  They have no reason to given the context here.
Running ASICBoost overtly is fine/dandy, it can even run on Segwit.  So where is the thinking that this is the reason Bitmain/Antpool is blocking SW to protect their covert ASICBoost?
The theory doesn't hold up because there is no reason for them to run it covertly.  It's not illegal, nor immoral.

It's very simple: You have one primary issue with many related symptoms.
**Issue:** Blocks are reaching their 1mb limit
**Symptoms:** Increased tx confirmation times, higher tx fees (to be included in next block)
**Outcomes:** If not resolved, utility of Bitcoin for average user will be reduced
A Systems Engineer would try to approach this issue within the context of the Bitcoin Whitepaper (your "source document" for Requirements) and try to figure out the easiest solution to implement.
1.  Increase blocksize.  Reduces tx times, reduces fees, improves utility
2.  Implement a rude-goldberg scaling scheme like Segwit
Clearly, option 1 improves throughput with the least amount of impact to the ecosystem.  Bitcoin remains fundamentally unchanged.  Blocks of &gt;1mb may be mined.  An upper limit can be set.
Bitcoin's security remains, and the system continues.  Segwit is needlessly complicated, and ultimately will not resolve scaling issues down the line.  It basically exists as a big "Fuck you" to those who secure the network (miners).  Especially considering the only "nodes" that matter are ones who actually mine coin, and aren't just running Core on a PC somewhere.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:33:46
There aren't any.

@_date: 2017-05-23 20:11:22


The reason the HK Agreement failed is that there was no guarantee for the implementation of a blocksize increase via HF.
If I understand this proposal correctly, the HF to 2mb is coded in to trigger at a specific point in time following the Segwit roll out.
This whole mess could've been avoided if Core/Blockstream did something similar in their client to roll out an 2mb HF at a specific block height following the SW SF.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:43:56
The issue here is the economic majority technically includes:
* Merchants (who exchange goods for BTC) -- Wants lower fees, faster processing time.
* Exchanges (who exchange BTC for fiat and vice versa) -- wants higher fees, indifferent to processing time
* Miners (who mine BTC and order txs) -- Wants higher BTC value, which means fees are worth more
You can't just split those three up.  Thing is: if I'm an exchange or a miner, what incentive do I have to support UASF?  It's simpler and less risky to do nothing than to get political here.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:22:28
PSA: There is no direct evidence to support the assertion that miners are rejecting SegWit activation to protect their covert use of ASICBoost.
None, zero, zip.  It's all speculation up to this point.

Okay, so it's inferior.


It's fine.  By the time we get to worrisome blocksizes a few things will happen:
1.  Costs of CPU power and storage will go down while capacity increases
2.  We'll be living on the moon


All I see are a bunch of shills who want to change Bitcoin *into something else*.

Miners **need** BTC to increase in value to keep up with the increasing energy costs from the difficulty in mining new blocks which is why I find the argument that miners would somehow conspire to destroy BTC to be so ludicrous.  They're the only ones around who's lifeblood depends on BTC succeeding.
Exchanges and merchants don't even care much about that.  Exchanges can always hop to the next big altcoin, and merchants can do the same.
From an analysis of stakeholders, miners are the ones most vested in the success of any coin.  Especially seeing as starting a mining pool has significant upfront capital costs (rigs and power) before turning over your first unit of profit.  Even when you're making money off of mining and fees, you still need to re-invest a portion of that to maintain your hashpower lead.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:04:54
The exchanges should not reward Sybil attacks.  I don't know why these posts are being allowed here.  UASF has no support beyond a bunch of nodes on some idiot's computers.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:22:47
He wouldn't need to.  If the HF happens, all his BTC becomes BCC. 
He's also not an idiot.  From what we've seen from the ETH fork, selling immediately is usually a money-losing proposition.  A lot of people who sold ETC for ETH missed out on a lot of potential gains.

I mean... we even have people on this very sub basically spooling up two or three nodes on their home PCs... isn't this why node-counts are generally unreliable for consensus changes?  Why we initially stuck with hashpower/POW?

@_date: 2017-07-28 00:34:31
IIRC, no.  Because you tx to the new wallet will be on the BTC/SW chain, while your old wallet will be on the BTC/BCC chain.

Why wouldn't you be able to run a node?  The biggest issue cited is that storage space will be an issue, but we have enough storage within mass market reach to accomplish that today.
Plus with bip100 the block growth would be 5% each difficulty adjustment... Assuming 75% hashpower signals in favor of it.

@_date: 2017-07-25 12:46:11
Based on what evidence?  
EVERYONE, including Ver, Bitmain, etc. have said multiple times they are committed to supporting the NY Agreement for Segwit2x.
BCC/Bitcoin ABC is a backup plan should those perfidious Segwit supporters back out of that agreement.
Jihan was already burned once by this whole debate when Bitcoin Core devs waffled on Hong Kong agreement, so this is leverage to avoid that.  
**Make no mistake, the only reason Segwit is being activated is because of the NYA.  Segwit2x will succeed as long as the planned HF occurs.  If that does not occur, then expect war.**
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:36:40
Disagree all you want, but the math is always in my favor here.  Segwit is not even a good short-term solution for the long-term problems of Bitcoin.  It is a size reduction of block data, but what happens when those blocks invariably become full again?
Just fucking HF the thing to bigger blocks, and call it a day.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:13:05
I meant fees for buying BTC from them, not mining fees.  These fees encompass both processing fees (from fiat/credit-to-BTC) and the fees they charge to keep the lights on.

@_date: 2017-07-25 15:31:53


Why indeed?  Miners are the only ones that matter.


Technically incorrect.  BIP50 resolved due to the fact that hashpower backed pre-0.8 compatible nodes.  
If the hashpower were in favor of 0.8 compatibility, then that chain would've continued.
Again, this simply re-affirms that mining nodes (and the client they use) is all that matters.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:35:07

Aren't his personal interests more in line with the community than say... Bitcoin Core?
Jihan has invested millions of dollars in infrastructure to develop the mining hashpower to be a leader in that area.  It's in his best interest to ensure that BTC's value increases over time (because that's how mining stays profitable).  Therefor, his interests are aligned with users.
Bitcoin Core has 0 stake in this game, except to implement SegWit.  SegWit is needed to remove power from the miners, therefor reducing the security of Bitcoin.  Something people in the banking industry would love as it removes competition to their monopoly.
There are also the shady links by AXA and blockstream and Core developers.  
At the end of the day, why should I trust a bunch of glorified coding-retards?  I'll put my money on the people with skin in the game every time over those with none.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:36:10
Contentious to whom?  The only people who would care are h0lders and even then it would settle down after a month or so.
Worse comes to worse there is some mild turmoil until the hashpower settles on one standard or we have a chain split.  Big deal.
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:11:23
You already trust strangers to verify your transactions.   
Again, the easiest solution is to implement bip100 and then do segwit.

@_date: 2017-07-28 00:41:24
Except, if SegwitCoin offers less incentive for miners to continue mining it, the miners will go to alts like BCC or ETH, etc.
If 2nd layer bullshit like LN takes off, that's even fewer fees to miners, further breaking the incentives to secure the network.
It's ultimately why Segwit/2X is the best compromise because you get fixes and you get on-chain scaling.  But if 2X is abandoned, I expect the miners will just pick up and leave... even attacking the original chain until it's demise as well.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:09:38
You're argument makes no logical or reasonable sense.  There is no such thing as miner centralization.  The miners are the only ones who have stake in Bitcoin to ensure its value continually rises.  Why would they do anything to undermine that?  Think about it. 
Segwit is unproven, it's dangerous, and irreversible.  It fundamentally changes the structure of the coin.  I mean for fucks sake, this subreddit is basically promoting a Sybil attack on Bitcoin on August 1st.  Fuck these people.   
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:11:49






Okay.... Lemme set you straight here: compared to today, how many more txs would Segwit add?
How many txs would an 2 (or 4) mb HF add?








Sure, because whole Segwit only works once, you can erstwhile keep increasing the block size.  Once 2mb are full, go 4.  Then go 8.  Then go 16.  Etc.
Want to try again? 
God, do you people ever stop and think?  Or does the shill machine run non stop.

Bullshit.  If they want to be the lead developers in the BTC ecosystem, then they need to be part of the solution, not the cause of the problem.


Currently sitting around 40-43%.  All it takes is two or three smaller pools jumping ship and we get that *contentious* HF we've all wanted to avoid.


Yes there is.  Since Hong Kong, everyone has wanted at least a 2mb HF.  But Bitcoin Core is insistent that Segwit be part and parcel of that.
The fact they prioritized Segwit first is a testament to that.  They never had intentions of supporting an HF.
You want this fucking problem fixed, the issue at hand here is Bitcoin Core.  They're fucking things up here.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:17:18
Dude, even UASF still depends on miners to fucking work.  You're being really myopic here.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:40:53


95% of the network is meaningless in the grand scheme of things.  If people fail to update, then they will simply no longer be part of Bitcoin.  
Remember, miners secure the network.  Not full nodes.  If one miner mines a block, and the others validate that, then it's a valid block.  If they build on that block, that becomes the longest PoW.  The longer and longer that occurs, the more secure that chain is, and whatever chain "full-nodes" support becomes moot.  The longest chain, given a consistent PoW Algorithm is dominated by the side with the most hashpower as they have the highest probability of mining the next block.
As Satoshi said, nodes can choose to enter and leave the network, but ultimately, it comes down to mining consensus.


If Coinbase supports SW2X as well as other major fiat-to-BTC exchanges, then they would invariably dominate the network, since there are probably more of those transactions than any others in BTC these days.  
Your node wouldn't matter.


This entire argument assumes all nodes ignore new rules.  Except, what happens if there are nodes which do accept new rules?  The entire argument falls apart.
For instance, say you run a BIP148 node and only want Segwit, but enough people run Segwit2X, all the miners run 2x?  Then what?  Congrats, you just forked yourself off the network and no longer matter.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:54:39


It's just as ready as Segwit and can be activated much sooner.  Unlike Segwit, BIP100 isn't a drastic change to the BTC architecture, it also has clear-cut consensus mechanisms and schedules for block size increases.


I don't think users have a choice in this matter really.  BTC isn't a democracy.  The only option they have as stakeholders is to use BTC or not to use it.


Far easier to manipulate than relying on consensus through hashpower for mining.  What's easier for someone to do?  Manipulate a ton of nodes?  Or own/run a mining concern?


Governments can't manipulate major exchanges??  Oh wee... so all that stuff with Bitfinex is just complete BS? ;)

There you go.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:33:37


Except they won't soooooooooooooooooooooo.


There are no sides, only miners.  Developers should just make what the miners want to run.  It's very simple.  


Miners want Bitcoin to be more valuable.  I want Bitcoin to be more valuable.  Exchanges want it to be more valuable.  Value comes from the price of the coin.  The price is driven by holding and usage.  To improve usage, you need faster confirmation times and lower tx fees.  Segwit is not the answer, HF2MB is a good start.  Segwit can be implemented later on.
Miners support an HF to at least 2mb to begin with, 8mb on the mid-size, or 32mb on the yolo side.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:12:53
They're not blocking shit.  They clearly want a 2mb hard fork and aren't willing to accept an IOU for it.
Bitcoin Core: "we'll totally code a 2mb HF, but only after Segwit activation... Pinky promise".
The problem is that there is no reason to trust an HF would ever happen.  If anything, Segwit and a 2mb increase should be done at the same time via fork.
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:14:29


You do realize no blocksize cap != unlimited blocks all the time... right?  Miners would still control the size of the blocks they mine and would have the incentive to grow blocksize to keep txs quick while balancing that with fees.
For instance, if we went to 2mb blocks right now, it would alleviate much of the pressure on the system, but the fees would still be there.  They would just be spread out over more txs which would be helpful overall.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:29:13


It would likely be miners and major economic nodes (exchanges) and those with large numbers of Bitcoins.


By what mechanism would this occur?
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:52:31


Yes.  They won't change the rules in a way which:
1. Devalues BTC
2. Reduces their fees/control


Reduce is an understatement.  It would fundamentally destroy the value in the coin.


This has been attempted in the past, but luckily, mining (and BTC) is decentralized to the point it's a non-issue.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:17:25

Clearly you're missing my point.  You can be open-source and still work with your critical stakeholders to implement changes.
The only way to implement changes on BTC is through the miners.  Segwit, Big Blocks, etc.  At the end of the day, they are a critical stakeholder.
A good developer prioritizes them first, captures their needs/wants for the future of the coin and works with them to develop a change.
Segwit, it appears, is not that solution.  Therefor, it's time for something else.
We can't be victims of Bitcoin Core's **Sunk Cost Fallacy**.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:03:45
My question to you is: *what is Blockstream doing to allow a group like the Bilderbergs to recoup their investment at a sum vastly greater than originally given?*
Answer: something about Segwit will allow rich people in the banking sector to get rich off of BTC, at the expense of something else.  Right now, the miners, but in the future?  
Fuck these guys, I'll trust the Chinese over them.

Or we can have bigger blocks and do the same thing without having to bend over for the Bilderbergs.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:10:05
This is stupid.  You realize that it would only encourage more miners to enter the game to take advantage of bitcoins higher price and to cash in on fees.
Also, miners are clearly incentived to keep the value in the coin high.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:53:48
I think UASF is beyond mere technical considerations... at the end of the day, if you're not a miner, your opinion effectively doesn't matter.  So says the Bitcoin Whitepaper.
I mean, you guys go right ahead.  This is how things are supposed to work.  You can choose to leave the network and come back in.  This is the same reason I don't care if Hard Forks are contentious.  Bitcoin doesn't need consensus, you can have multiple chains going, but eventually one wins out.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:57:53

Nobody gives a shit.  Segwit = shitwit at this point.
You guys have become **insane**. You keep trying the same thing and expecting a different result.  Stop making "fetch" happen.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:00:27
Issue is: if BTC is not longer useful, and it's value plummets, even those fees rising will not overcome the overall loss that comes with users moving to alts like ETH.  
When that happens, you can see miners moving away from BTC to other cryptos to make their money there (if they can reuse their hardware).

Segwit now, 2mb hard fork pinky promise was a bad idea.  Miners want that 2mb HF guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:29:39
Like SegWit, FlexTrans would require folks to update.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:51:47
Man, did you even read the fucking Bitcoin whitepaper?
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:11:12
No, it just means no one gives a shit about a shitcoin.  Segwit is supposed to alleviate issues and add features that aren't present in Litecoin due to a lack of usage/stress.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:15:11
The 40% of hashpower which wants bigger blocks.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:14:05
It's not my cause.  I personally don't give a flying fuck.  I'm just pointing out to tards like yourself that the only way a solution gets implemented is with help from the miners.
If they don't want Segwit (by itself), it's not gonna happen.  EVER.  There is nothing you can do about it.
So instead of commiserating here about it, maybe it's time to do something the miners seem to be willing to implement: *a 2mb blocksize increase.*  Or at the very least, a hard-fork encompassing both a blocksize increase and Segwit **at the same time**.
Why?  Because why should we trust Bitcoin Core or DCG to carry through what is essentially a "pinky promise" of Segwit now and maybe a 2mb blocksize increase.  There is no enforcement mechanism of that rule, and therefor it's bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:35:52
So has Flexible Transaction, which also has added benefits over Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:27:08
But it doesn't erase old transaction types, it basically doesn't allow new transactions using those formats.  Basically, you'd get an error saying your transaction wouldn't be compete until you update your client.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:25:12
Plenty, but much of it is surrounding how to make money off of it in the form of exchanges or re-packaging it into financial instruments to get it out to a wider audience.
Only Blockstream seeks to fundamentally transform it.  Everyone else is just trying to cash in on it.


LOL, okay, fine.  Enjoy CorporateCoin there buddy.  Maybe they'll let you earn some money after they've had theirs.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:02:25
They aren't (all) pumping ETH, but generally watching its rise relative to BTC.  Basically the "flippening-watch" is all about pointing out how the 1mb blocksize limit is strangling BTC's growth allowing competitors to rise.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:58:03


This current scaling debate is holding down the value of BTC.  Especially as it's usability diminishes due to high-fees and long confirmation times.
Current estimates point out BTC could be 3-4x more valuable if we resolve the scaling debate.  I think that would sufficiently cover the loss in expected fees, no?


@_date: 2017-06-14 01:36:28


Blame the Segtards here for that.  They seem to be resisting this for no good reason.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:52:50
...and for some reason that's bad right?
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:33:42
About fucking time.  This is how protocol upgrades should be done.
It's clear, concise, secure, and protects against UASF/Sybil attacks.  It even has replay-protection.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:52:45
As a Systems Engineer, the developers committed a gross act of negligence in their "solution" to the current problem.  They ignored their key stakeholders and failed to secure their cooperation in rolling out a solution.
Segwit could work out great as a technical solution, but it's chance of implementation means its a bad solution.
Segwit in the SE world contains a lot of "gold plating" (aka, things it does that aren't really needed or widely wanted) to fix a very small and easy problem.  Sure it's a kick-ass solution, but Bitcoin doesn't need LN or other bullcrap.  It just needs faster tx confirmations.  
Simplest solution?  Develop a HardFork that scales on chain through blocksize increases... like BIP100 or one of the other Big Block BIPs.  
Core could've easily shelved their "idea" and helped fix the problem.  But they didn't.  The miners don't trust Core, Core has no support from the miners, and here we are.
So now, given Core's failing, a vacuum exists.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:52:16
I get that, but not every Chinese person is a commie spy.  They're people, just like you and I.
Bitcoin is beholden to no one, so why are we acting like it is?
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:10:47
...and Segwit probably is too!
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:53:38
How do we know that's spam though?  What do you define as spam?  Maybe someone is moving coin around? Using a tumbler, etc?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:57:28
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:18:04
Big blocks now, it's the simplest and most elegant fix to all of our issues.  Segwit undermines aspects of Bitcoin's security by moving tx off the chain.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:18:10
Bigger blocks have more support than Segwit right now.  If Bitcoin Core release a client supporting Big Blocks and no Segwit, this fucking debate would be done and over with by next week.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:46:45


Again, by the whitepaper, the only ones who should be gatekeepers are people with the CPU power.  AKA, the miners.  Everyone else is just a user.


I see no reason to compromise with a company who's interest in Bitcoin is unclear.  Blockstream needs to monetize Segwit *somehow*, folks like the Bilderbergs don't get rich by giving away millions of dollars for free.
Are you saying that doesn't scare you?  At all?
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:16:07
Diversification is a smart move... Especially if the UASF terrorists pull off their Sybil in August.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:11:48
News flash: *any major protocol change requires a fucking fork*.  Want Segwit?  Needs to fork.  Want bigger blocks? Needs to fork.
Even UASF is a fork which depends on miners doing the fucking fork.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:20:42
No it isn't.  Elegance implies: *pleasingly ingenious and simple*.  Segwit is neither.  Raising the blocksize is easy and simple.
Also, other fixes have been proposed in addition to bigger blocks, like Flextrans.  But because your overlords at Blockstream got money from Big Banking^tm, they need the solution which enables those banks to monetize bitcoin and to control it.  
Big Banking^tm wants to control BTC.  Doing that means undermining the miners.


They have.  BIPs 100, 101, 102, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:19:16
You do realize that passive support is still support, right?  Like Donald Trump not directly denouncing white supremacists but still benefiting from them indirectly. 
To clarify: *if you support Segwit, then you technically support Blockstream because their end goal is Segwit too*.  Regardless of commits. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:17:13
You can't just pay yourself like that.  You get nothing out of it.  
Spamming the system is just a red herring that is tougher to do now more than ever.  Especially since Bitcoin costs a lot of money compared to what it was when the 1mb limit was instituted.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:20:45
I agree.  Which is weird, because everyone on the fucking Bitcoin Core team are all privileged first-world types who laugh at small dollar purchases.
Everyone here likes to joke that Bitcoin isn't about paying for your morning coffee... but in places like Africa and India, where the comparative cost (USD) of your morning coffee is more than you make in a day, it's a big fucking transaction.
Unlock the blocks, keep the scaling on-chain.  Later on, if that solution eventually runs out, then maybe implement Segwit+Off Chain Scaling.
Fuck, let Litecoin beta test for a few years and work out the issues and vaporware there.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:54:49
Right, so if mining remains profitable, why would it ever centralize?
In a few years, I predict mining to return to places like the USA, especially as Chinese energy costs inevitably rise.
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:35:31
That's a lie.  Nothing reckless about it.  Bitcoin wasn't designed to be capped at 1mb from the outset.  That change was added after, and that change was always meant to be temporary.
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:35:41
Except Segwit won't activate.... So it's not a good solution.  It's a complete failure by any metric and continues to get pushed by folks trapped in a sunk cost fallacy.
Bigger blocks are easier and can happen sooner.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:31:36
Lol, okay...
How about this: what's the simplest path to alleviating the current situation that the miners (a large majority) of them will agree to?  Clearly, the answer is not Segwit because it's not gonna happen.
The easiest solution isn't always the best, but it's the one we can implement.  As the ol' saying goes *"I'll take an 80% solution today over a 100% solution in 10 years"*.  Or...*"better is the enemy of good enough"*
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:34:01
Opposition from who?  You realize the miners can just practice EC and control the block growth rate that way.  Or implement a BIP that sets clear signaling metrics for growth.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:02:34
In how many *years*?  By then memory will likely be cheaper and plentiful than today.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:50:34
I don't trust anyone on the Segwit side because they want to force people to trust things (no be trustless).  Bigger blocks don't rely on me trusting anyone because it continues the current paradigm where miners=nodes that matter.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:52:28
Nope.  Why?  If I need to transact something I'll just use a wallet on my phone or blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:44:55
Wow... one comment... 
Even though Roger is *technically* correct that mining nodes are the only ones which matter.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:59:46
Probably not because it makes the same mistake Hong Kong did.  Right now, the order of operations should be: *immediate* HF to 32mb, then SW if we need to use it later on.
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:16:55


Use FlexTrans.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:57:14
It'll be fine.  So what if the price tanks, it means cheaper coins to buy back in.
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:33:55


I vaguely recall it.  As I understand it, the community voted to change the rules to recover stolen funds.  I would still side with the miners, because its harder for them to make rule changes.


But the value of each BTC will rise.


How do you think Bitmain got ASICBoost?
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:57:42


So... it's not like this would be easy to accomplish, nor would it get sufficient support.


You may need to elaborate more for me please?  
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:03:27
Hardforks are fine, don't worry about it.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:15:06


But why would I use BTC for this when I have my credit card?
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:34:24
Because the Treasury has the power to charter a bank, right?
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:10:07
I mean, I'm hedging my bets... and Ethereum is something I bought months ago so I'm happy with it.  But I feel they have fundamental issues they will have to deal with in the future that Bitcoin is dealing with as well.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:39:49
If anything, miners are the ultimate users.  They secure the network.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:23:25
The current paradigm is that the miners have **all the power** which is the underlying foundation of bitcoin.  Segwit changes that fundamental premise to give power to other parties.
1mb is a temporary measure, it always was.  Satoshi said it itself.  Remove the 1mb limit (the next one would be the 32mb messaging limit) entirely.
Segwit can fucking wait or die in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:40:23
Same here.  Love how the UASF sockpuppets died when Bitcoin Core dropped the hammer on that idea.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:05:53
Which they aren't on Litecoin...
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:15:48
80% support SW+2mbHF... they will reject UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:07:23
Again, make the case that someone will attempt it at Bitcoin's current price?  The only reason it was a problem before is because Bitcoin was worthless.  Today it's different.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:17:12


But they don't have miners, so fuck em'.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:18:35


Right, which undercuts a core component if Bitcoin's security, where everything is verified *on the blockchain*.
Also, why should miners be cut out of their hard-earned fees?  They're being paid to secure the system.


Satoshi has spoken to this issue at length in the past.  His guidance on the matter still remains relevant.


Except, the miners are the ones getting money for doing something.
Blockstream got money from investors to do what exactly?  It's not like these people give them cash out of the goodness of their hearts, they expect some form of monetization out of this.
Bitmain's motives are far clearer: *mine bitcoin/make money from fees/sell coins*.
What are Blockstream's motivations?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:32:32
They sell drugs on Amazon?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:07:12


Economic majority includes the miners...
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:32:00


That's a feature, not a bug.  Wallet Nodes are fucking pointless.
