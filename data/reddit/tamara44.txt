I agree, and i do not support it, and I did not smash my iPhone. But let's talk more about why the Apple's decision is equally retarded, that's the crux of the matter.

But you are not mentioning, that for iPhone users who just needs mobile bitcoin wallet, this Apple decision will cost them quite a lot of money. For example, some people suggest, that if you don't like Apple phone, you should just buy Android phone. But what does this mean in practice?
1) You need to buy new smartphone
2) You need to research the app store for equivalent iOS apps you were using on your iPhone - that my take many hours, since you have to evaluate a lot of apps to find those you like most
3) Some Android apps are also not free, which is another investment.
4) Your iOS apps are useless, you will not get any refund for those.
5) Yes, you can sell your old iPhone device, but this do not counterbalance the first four points.
From this perspective, Apple decision will cost those people money and time, and Apple not only would not apologize for that, they even do not try to explain their decision to their own customers!

Try to think about it more and I believe you will figure it out yourself. (hint: they probably don't hate capitalism, they hate one particular Apple decision).

Maybe, but not more than the decision to block bitcoin apps on Apple devices. Seems similarly retarded to me.

How many bitcoins to they own overall? They are working overtime since they are motivated to... it's not they are doing some heroic selfless feat. ;-)

Fair point. I didn't want to downplay their contribution. I just wanted to say that they have a huge financial incentive to work on it.

Many people will disapprove of such action -&gt; will think bitcoin believers are strange -&gt; will not invest into bitcoin -&gt; bitcoin market cap will grow slower.
