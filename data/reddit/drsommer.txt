Is it just me, or has this kind of circlejerk gotten worse over the last couple weeks? I'm seeing more and more "DAE fuck tha government?" posts, accompanied by quotes of famous investors used to illustrate how wrong they are about crypto. Not to forget the daily dose of "hurr durr I can buy drugs with dollars, let's ban dollars!".
I thought we were over that phase :(

Guess who's going to be their third in about two weeks!

I'm assuming that this is the case. ~~When~~ If shit really hits the fan and Gox goes down, Dollars are harder to hide than bitcoins. Even if it takes years of lawsuits and investigations, chances of you getting your $$$ back are slightly better than getting your bitcoins back.

What happens if you're in the middle of a download when it changes the IP? Does the download continue?

Haha, I didn't ask. Judging by the clerks reaction though, paying with bitcoin is still not a very common occurence.

You know, I think that's what most people consider to be the problem.

Because a frustratingly huge amount of Germans doesn't give a single fuck about Bitcoins. Most people who have the influence and/or money to actually start a Bitcoin-related business are too backward to even use the internet, let alone a cryptocurrency.

Hi Dad! I didn't know you use reddit.

As far as I know, Germany isn't exactly "Bitcoin-friendly". Our government gives too little of a shit to even bother taxing them, and virtually no one here knows about them.
Source: living in Germanys second biggest city and not having seen a single "Bitcoin accepted here" sign. Also, not having met a single person in real life who knows about Bitcoins.
At least in Germany, we're *very* far from a global player such as DHL accepting bitcoin. Current legal situation is unclear (therefore way too risky for a big company to adopt Bitcoins), also there's virtually no demand here. They simply don't have a reason to adopt it (yet).
With the US population and media being lightyears in front of Germany in that matter, let's hope the US branch of DHL is capable of doing the right decision. Best of luck to you guys!

Worked Flawlessly! It was the first time I paid something IRL with bitcoin, so I was a little nervous, but it worked really good. Got there just in time before the price drop :)

If that is true, I'm done with these fuckers. I don't even use gox or btc-e, all of my fiat-to-bitcoin transfers go over bitcoin.de, but I just can't stand the fact that a bank patronizes its clients. Does anyone know a bitcoin-friendly bank in Germany that has a reasonable number of accessible (fee-less) ATMs?

I am an engineering student in Germany and maybe 5% of the students I've talked to have heard of bitcoin.

No. Actually, you should delete this post. The less attention this shit gets, the better. Shit like this damages the reputation of the bitcoin system.

Does fidor have their own ATMs, or do they at least have contracts with other banks that allow me to withdraw Euros at their ATMs?
