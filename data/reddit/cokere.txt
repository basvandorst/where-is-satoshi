I would say that's over the top. Crypto is mostly well understood and if you use 'standard' tools you should be OK.  In this case, bitcoin would handle the cryptographic stuff for you.  All this does is provide a web front end for transactions.  They're not storing people's wallets or giving them accounts. 
The way this system is setup, the only one with anything at risk would be Willet. They have the bitcoins in their account for a short time, then forward them to you. You don't have an account with them, they have nothing of yours that hackers could steal.

Rainbow Tables are a little more complicated then that.

I don't think were anywhere near the cost of electricity yet. If a machine draws 1kwatts of electricity, it uses 24Kwatt hours of electricity per day. A kwatt hour costs about 25 cents, so that's $6. If the machine is pumping 1 bitcoin per day (let's say, what 1.7Ghashes/sec?) then that's mostly profit. 
Otoh, it's questionable whether or not, with the power costs, you'll make money on a new investment.

Ah. I was actually thinking about doing the same thing you guys just did, but I figured you could 1) let the user enter the address they are going to send from, or 2) give them a token to include in the bitcoin message.
@_date: 2011-06-29 04:43:09
Well, that's a reasonable point but I meant more knowing the actual algorithms and how, mathematically you can do cryptanalysis and that kind of thing. The algorithms aren't actually that hard, I've actually implemented RSA myself. 
@_date: 2011-07-02 05:28:38
I actually don't know that that would be possible.  The PAC needs to keep track of it's donors, and if they took bitcoin, they wouldn't know who sent them the money.

What about resale value? The question is whether or not you'll make more then the deprecation on your hardware, not whether or not you'll make back the full purchase price. 
On the other hand, the more people who invest in mining, the less for everyone who is currently doing it.  So yeah, stop everyone. :)

1) Hmm, that's annoying.  I actually haven't sent any bitcoins yet. 
2) As for number two, looking at the structure of the [tx message]( however the system is ridiculously flexible.  You could just include the token as data after the end of the 'program' that runs, or the spec actually suggest using ['OP_DROP' to include a message]( 


So, you could include a token with a product ID or you could even encrypt the product ID with the public key of the recipient. 
I don't know if the standard bitcoin client supports that, though.

A 1 difficulty, I think, means that submitting 1 share would, on average, get you 50 bitcoins.

Way over priced. The cost to build a rig should be about $1/Mash, or maybe a bit more, without overclocking.

Hey everyone.
Okay so I've been a redditor for a whilebut I want that account to stay anonymous (but my main account has a ton of Karma, really!).   Anyway I've actually gotten really into bitcoin lately and right now I've been more interested in building mining rigs (Hey, an excuse to build a super computer!  If bitcoin fails I'll still have supercomputers! How awesome I that?) but I'd love to get involved in programming for the community to help bitcoin be a success.  Aside from everything else, as a developer it has a huge potential to be used for real micro payments for games and things like that - which is good because I hate advertising.
Anyway, I've had some cool ideas for bitcoin services: Basically I posted this in another thread but a web based (that you could host on your own server -- or desktop of you want) system that allowed users to work with bitcoin like any other web based system and did a remote multi-system backup (again, to a servers you control if you want) with each transaction.  The idea would be that non-technically adept users would be able to manage their bitcoins as easily as anything else on the web, with no risk of corrupting their wallet.dat file.  If the system was successful, you could even insure the bitcoins against data corruption.

Plenty of nvidias.

Optimized for floating point, not integer operations used in hashing, I would guess. Actually ATis are a *little* better at raw floating point compared to Nvidia, but Nvidia has a longer history with scientific computing so a lot of people use their GPUs and program them with CUDA. 
But yeah mostly about integer vs. floating point speed.  The hashing algorithm uses a bunch of bitwise ands and ors, and if the hardware is optimized to do floating point calculations, it won't work well for that.

It would be hilarious if the U.S decided to sell off it's gold supply in order to pay bills while negotiations are ongoing.  The price would collapse, and all those goldbugs would be totally screwed.  
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:54:19
Why use an intermediary account? Couldn't you just have the funds sent directly to the users's wallet, then monitor the block for the transaction to show up?

If you have the fans at 100% it's easy to stay at or under 70 C with a 6870 or 6970. Even multiple 6870s.

Apparently it was just a domain name they had sitting around (it sounds like the site was sold at some point, either before or after BTC took off, I'm not sure).   I have a bunch of domains I'm not using for various ideas I had over the years, but even then I think I would probably get a real domain for something like this 
(in fact, I actually just registered a bitcoin related domain the other day :P)

You should really measure your power use though.  I had a cheapo 850 watt PSU and it drew ~820 watts to power 4x 6870s.  Then it blew a capacitor (after about six hours) 
I replaced it with an "80+ bronze" certified unit and the power draw dropped to 665watts.  That means, running full time over a month it would wasted 200 watts or 1 kWh of electricity every five hours. That's almost 150 1 kWh a month, or potentially $30/mo. 
A high efficiency PSU will **literally** pay for itself in a month or two.

You can install it on another machine, just copy the wallet.dat file.  As long as you don't generate any new transactions you should be able to keep them in synch.

Yeah, but SATA SSDs are overkill.  I'm using Ubuntu on a $15 USB stick. That guy has 12 machines.  He said he was using 30g (30!) OCZs, which cost $75 on newegg. Assuming $15 for an 8g stick (you might be able to squeeze it to 4 if you wanted) That's $60*12 = $720 completely wasted.  He's also getting overpriced cases.

I would guess that they make the bulk of their money from embedded GPUs for laptops and smartphones, not high-end graphics cards which are more about R&amp;D.
Still, this will help AMD gain market share on Nvidia in terms of using GPUs for scientific applications.  AMD cards are more powerful, but people preferred programming in CUDA over OpenCL.  Lots of people are learning OpenCL and it's being used on probably the world's largest distributed system.

They have a [7.82% profit margin]( and analysts estimate 0.08 cents per share next quarter

That was written today and doesn't mention the fact that bitcoin's value bounced back and hit $17 again?

Yeah, bitcoin can't go 'bankrupt' since it can't take on debt. It's price might drop to near zero, but at least some people might like them as 'collectibles'. In theory it could die if enough people lost interest in being on the network that it became easy for people to takeover.

Buying bitcoins is against Paypal's TOS. If someone finds out you're selling bitcoins via Paypal, they'll freeze the account.

maybe in the future muggers will steal your cellphone with your wallet then force you to give up the password at gunpoint (presumably by then wallet.dat files will be encrypted by default). 
Of course, if the system is setup with deniable cryptography (which truecrypt supports right now) you could store a couple bucks in a wallet that you give out, and the rest secured elsewhere)

I actually tried (mostly out of curiosity) that with EC2, IIRC I got about 180 MHashes per second.  A bit lower then a mid-range AMD/ATi card. Each GPU got me 80Mhashes/second and each CPU (there were 8) got me 2.5. 
In the end though, after 7 hours I had rung up about $14 in fees, about half the price of a bitcoin.
Also, I have no idea why but the second GPU would crap out on me after about an hour.  This happened twice.  I'm not sure what the deal is. 
The Irony is, before bitcoin NVidia was the king of GPUs, despite lower performance (people loved CUDA).  But now people are going crazy for AMD cards. 
It's not worth it. Just build a mining system with some AMD/ATi cards.

No kidding.  I have Ubuntu running of a $15 USB stick.  No need for a hard drive at all.

The awesome thing about bitcoin is that you don't need any encryption to ACCEPT funds.  You can leave your wallet encrypted and offline, you don't even need access to it. Just monitor the blocks for your transaction to go through. 
The only weakness here is that BitWillet holds the money for a short period of time (untill the transaction is authenticated).  If they got hacked, presumably the hackers could get whatever BitWillet was holding. 
I'm not sure that is though.  They could just send the money directly to the website's wallet, and simply monitor the transaction for them.  So I'm curious about why that is. 
And as others mentioned, very few people have degrees in encryption. The basic concepts and how to use the tools aren't that difficult. You don't necessarily need to know "the math" in order to use crypto libraries. The trick is the 'gotchas' like using things slightly incorrectly (like MtGox using MD5) but that can happen even if you know the math. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 04:16:51
Actually it might be better to just send a message to the website that someone tried to pay, then a follow message when the transaction is confirmed. 
For the user, you could give them a link to check and see on the status of the transaction

It didn't lose 99.9% of it's value in a day.  The price crashed on one exchange, but it lost about 50% of it's value across the board, then bounced back.  That's similar to what you'd see in the price of a new stock that's just been listed on NASDAQ or something. They're not all doomed to fail.
