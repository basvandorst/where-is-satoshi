And the "stealth" address never appears in the blockchain.  How does this harm anonymity in any way?

I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted; you make some valid points.


True, but it's possible the blockchain is one of the only ways of transmitting that information securely and reliably.  


Yeah, a concern of mine.  Imagine 50 stealth address payments in the same transactions.  That's 50 ECC multiplies along with 50 equality checks for each of the 50 outputs.  Sounds like it doesn't scale well for large transactions.  Most payments aren't large, though.


It's worth noting that it makes use of provable prunable outputs (OP_RETURN &lt;data&gt;).  I'm not sure I'd call it "pollution", but it does add some space requirements.


If I wanted to use BIP32 to send a payment to you using a new address every time, I'd have to transmit to you in one way or another which keypair index I used to produce the key.  BIP32 combined with OP_RETURN &lt;encrypted keypair index&gt; seems like a sleeker way of implementing stealth addresses.
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:35:41


BIP32 keypair indexes are 31-bit, though, and not a ridiculous argument to propose that one could brute-force scan the entire space.  You can derive deeper paths, but that's just more information to transmit.  Pubkey addition (where the addend is a shared secret) seems simpler and better for privacy.

This normalized txid is insufficient, I believe. It also feels kinda hacky, since it breaks down when used with nontraditional transaction types. I propose the following in order to track transactions reliably:
When a customer issues a withdraw of bitcoins, first create a new private key. Use this private key to sign a non-malleable part of the txn. I like the set of input prevouts [(txhash0,n0) || ...] for what to sign. Don't use 0-confirmation inputs. Then add an extra OP_RETURN output with that signature as the data. 
If someone modifies the outputs of the transaction, the sigs in the inputs become invalid.  If someone includes this OP_RETURN output in another txn, the signature won't verify. MtGox (and anyone, really) can verify this is their tx by checking transaction outputs for this particular OP_RETURN output and verifying the signature. 
If a customer claims the coins were never delivered, mount gox can undeniably prove they created a transaction and point to it in the blockchain.

Hey, author of  here.  Thanks for mentioning my site, and I'm glad you've found it useful.
Like you, I also store Bitcoins in a P2SH multisig wallet but I derive my keys differently.   I make use of BIP32 deterministic wallets (see my other site  so that I only need to save one set of keys. From that, I can produce all the wallet addresses I'll ever need.

Author of ms-brainwallet.org here. 
ms-brainwallet does not use Math.random() to generate private keys like brainwallet.org, so my site does not suffer from the same vulnerabilities that brainwallet.org does. However, even though I use it for my own personal multisig wallets I recommend everyone use it with caution and **definitely** offline for large amounts. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:40:43
BIP32 is a strategy for deriving a wallet full of addresses in a deterministic manner.  BIP38  is a strategy for encrypting a single private key.  They're two of the most mentioned BIPs bit they are indeed quite different.

Out of curiosity, suppose you **do** have a reliable, secure two-way communication for payments and still want to make use of stealth payments. Instead of publishing the ephemeral public key as part of OP_RETURN &lt;pubkey&gt;, I could just give it to the recipient and tell him to look for a stealth address based on that pubkey.  In this way, people looking at the transaction wouldn't even know whether it's a normal send or stealth-address send.
If you don't have a reliable and secure communication channel to transmit the pubkey, but you do have two-way communication, you can encrypt the ephemeral key using the public key of the recipient.
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:23:55
So? You don't *have* to interact with counterparties this way.  
It would be like putting your BTC address in your bitcointalk.org forum signature. Counterparties know your forum handle.  So what?
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:21:51
ms-brainwallet.org also supports BIP32 derived multisig wallets/addresses.  It has for a while now, but it's unfortunately not really meant for the layman to use.

As the headline says, I just released bip32.org, a BIP32 deterministic address generator.  
It's a great tool if you want to learn about BIP32 or actually use them as brain wallets.

Hey Gavin!
What are you thoughts on a fragmented (read: democratized) full node world?  In other words, is it better to have one reference implementation of Bitcoin (i.e., Bitcoin Core) plus other various small Bitcoin nodes, or no reference implementation and the network consisting of many different implementations?  I can see pros and cons to both sides, but do you have a preference?
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:04:14


I publish my bitcoin (stealth) address.  No 3rd party is capable of seeing how much people have sent to it.  Period.
If I spend from one of those payments, the recipient of my spend cannot connect two separate payments to my stealth address (he wouldn't know what to look for).

My site  has supported HD multisig since day  Maybe I should market this better? :-)

And your answer: it doesn't have significance other than an arbitrary choice.
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:37:31
Back "in the day" humans decided somewhere to divy up time into segments called days.  We went with 24 hours, though later figured out that it was somewhere between 23:59 and 24:00 that described a full revolution of the earth about its pole.
As humans progressed, we started tracking change of "things" in "days".  For instance, the high temperature of today might be 79 degrees F.  That "of today" refers to the "time" between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.  Why did we pick those times? No idea, but we did.
So what's the significance of picking midnight UTC?  Well, UTC, as its name might imply, is kind of a generally accepted "universal" day change.  We might speak of a high price or low price, or a price at 00:00:00 (open) and a price at 23:59:59 (close) of any given asset.

In fact, better than 2FA where you have to trust a 3rd party server, use multisignature cold storage.  One key is produced by software like Multibit, another produced from brainwallet and the third produced by a friend or relative.  You control two out of three keys, and can spend without the third, but the third is available in case one of your two keys have been lost. FWIW, I've already implemented this. See

A valid complaint! Two things of note: 1) the code is available on github so you can clone it to an offline machine, just as you can with brainwallet.org.  2) I'm considering paying some big names in the Bitcoin community to do a source code audit.  Would that be something you (and people like you) would appreciate?


I hadn't considered https since there's no secure data being transferred but I suppose it'd be nice to be assured the code wasn't modified in transit. I'll look into getting https working (FWIW, brainwallet.org doesn't support https, either).

I think this is why it's important to clone the source code locally and verify checksums if you're really paranoid.  Running the code offline is also the next best thing you can do for securing your coins.
