This.  So many scams. So many people trying to avoid major exchanges because of bad customer service only to choose a fraudulent seller and lose their purchase.
Just stick with legit sources.

It’s normal. If you are in US, it’s a bank holiday weekend as well.

Coinbase, GDAX, Gemini, Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex and others.  But you’ll get many people blasting some portion of my list. 
Transfers typically take 5 business days. People in a hurry pay a steep price with credit card purchases. 
Don’t use the apps, use their websites.

They are exposed to hacks, exchange shutdowns and government intervention. Google Mt Gox and read that story. Basically that exchange failed, shut down and account holders lost their money. Phishing is widespread in the crypto world, too.

Yes. You can give anyone an address and they can send bitcoin to it.

Cross post response from your other thread. Coinbase fees can be as high as 4.5% over GDAX last trade if using a credit card to purchase. 
Otherwise great info for beginners. Thanks.

I think you might need to review math. If bitcoin goes up 100% in 2018, it will be worth $18k. 100% represents a doubling of the value. 200% is 3x and so one. 
If bitcoin rises 1000%, it would be worth $90k.

Trezor.io is the official site and store for their products. 
If you move bitcoin to hardware wallet addresses, you will need to send it back to your exchange deposit address when you wish to sell.

It was 2 errors and not just an extra zero. 100% would not be $90k. That’s 1000%. Your example assumed a 100% price rise. That’s $18k and can be reached if that rate stayed steady. And $900k would be 10,000% rise.

Yes. It is one way only.  Once they send bitcoin, the transaction cannot be canceled or reversed. No challenge or refund unless you manually send them bitcoin refund. 
You should create a new bitcoin address for each payment and then share the public key with the payer. Be sure you understand how public and private keys work and how moving bitcoin around occurs in different types of storage or wallets.
