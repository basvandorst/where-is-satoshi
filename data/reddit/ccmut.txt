Of course they would still try and control and serveil us. No they most likely wont use btc for taxes they will still use the same system they use now based on the dollar without the actual dollars. Fed wouldnt be giving anything up do you really think that when the gov says its going to print more money they actually sit there and print it out on green little notes? There is a large influx of people into crypto that are just speculating to make a dollar that doesnt change the principle or the use case.

I see. No it wont get rid of taxes but it does stop the goverment from controlling us through finance. We no longer have to depend on them to issue our currency or fall prey to their activities. 10% hair cuts for the "wealthy",  inflation,  control through survalence and profiling ect... Bitcoin may not be what we use in the future but it has opened the door for us to self issue our money and wealth and that is a scary thing for big banks and gov

What happens if the fed reserve walks into the white house and says we are starting today going to get rid of cash the banks will recieve cash deposits for the next 6 months, and will no longer issue cash to anyone. We encourage all citizens to bring their cash in and open an accout. What choice would we as the citizens have but to go to the bank and register in their system. Millions of people would be forced to join the credit/debit system or starve. With btc and other decentralized crypto no one can do that. That is the value. 
People in india greece and other contries have already been subject to these types of control

What do you mean the supply doesnt grow at a predictable rate? It grows at a completely predictable rate i believe it will be 2145 when the last satoshi is mined and you can canculate the exact amount of btc there will be between now and then. The inherit use of it could easily be the network or maybe the fact that we no longer have to live under the control of a central bank or goverment.

Lending money out of thin air which is commonly refered to as printing money. The point isnt for the gov to adopt bitcoin and use it that is not going to happen they will continue same as always the point is people like you and me have a choice now to use something outside of their control.
They cant loan more btc into existence they cant errode my wealth through inflation or stop me from buying selling or paying anyone i choose in btc. With this technology we have found a way to do money without central authority the possibilities are endless. If you dont like btc then create your own crypto currency if its usefull people will use it

It has happened all over the world in some if the biggest economys and is being proposed in the
US right now. 
India already removed their large bills from circulation. The US plans to follow the same route.
Everything will still be done in dollars probably on a larger global scale than now. That 90% of the world you speak of doesnt not carry around brief cases filled with cash they use the credit/debit US denominated system. I said what if they ban cash not US dollars. The point of btc weither all these new people flooding the market know it or not is to remove the need for central authority for issuance/control of currency. So we as people no longer have to be subjugated to it with our ��. When they do this ban on cash and they are and will. Ill be glad i have another choice.

The network and there for the miners only care if a transaction meets the requirements and has proper amount of fees. Its in there own personal intrest $$$ to process every valid transaction. 
Here is a good explanation. The bit of centralization in mining isnt a huge deal.

Trying to point out the fact that everyone doesnt like bcash until it starts to be profitable for them

The way i understand it is the bitcoin is pre purchased so when you use the atm your purchase is instant

Burst in what USD. The end game of all fiat is inflation to infinity and when it fails they put out a new one. In the process stealing your mine our parents and children true wealth our time and freedom. If bought bitcoin at $4 or $200 its gotta go along way to devealuate as much as your precious dollars have in the last 10yr. We were at 5k 6 months ago and at 1k a yr ago im still up like alot alot
