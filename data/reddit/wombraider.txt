Or send you to a for profit prison so you can spend your days building cheap furniture so Boss Hogg gets richer.

John McAfee offered something tangible... if not... substantial... to him at least.

R34 Gtr, R35 Gtr, S15 (already had one), Jzx100, Mk4 Supra, and a Lexus GSF to daily drive. 
Might get a nice manual M3 or M4 too. 
And the crown jewel will be a 1974 Datsun 240z with a 2JZ big single turbo swap. 
Wouldn't mind a Toyota Landcruiser modified post apocalyptic style for when I have to leave the Citadel.

Cock and Ball Torture? Sounds like you should do a session with McAfee...

America was the greatest idea ever. A republic by and for the people. Man it had the potential to be so beautiful. 
But, 200 years of successive centralised bankers and their political pets (Shillary is a prime example) chipping away at and eroding your freedoms and rights has left it a banana republic, beholden to dark financial powers and forced to play the world policeman. 
Income inequality in the West is getting worse all around the world. There’s not really anywhere good left. There are too many people on earth and what used to be good about the west (owning property and lower populations) is being eroded by a constant influx of third worlders to prop up the failing growth at any cost deflationary economic system. Please believe that there is no racial undertone in that statement. 
Long story short, I’m just waiting for the world to hurry up and crash so I can go live in a bitcoin citadel. Hopefully sans compulsory microchip.
