Any Lengths Resources. It's a halfway house in Bessermer, Al. It saved my life from drugs. It's not a flop house at all.  You have to go to groups, works the steps, get a sponsor, go to one meeting everyday and get a job. They also just opened one up in Pensacola, FL. It has a higher success rate than most rehabs in the country. The money could help with the entrance fee and first month rent which equals 1200. A lot of those guys don't have family to pay theirs way and that way they cAn get in, get a month under their belt and get a job and pay on their own. They could also use the money to start a new one somewhere else or add on to the existing ones to have more beds. There's always a waiting list.

I've known about bitcoin for 3 or 4 years, and it is in the mainstream news it seems like now more than back then. It's just not new to people like us anymore. You know, people who understand it.

You shouldn't buy bitcoin with the intention of just sitting on all of it while waiting on a big run.  The people who are just letting the coin sit in their wallet need to go spend some money with one or several of the companies that take it as payment now. Say you have 10 btc and are waiting and waiting for this thing to take off again. Well if you and the other million people sitting on 10 btc would go spend 1 btc, then those 9 you have left will be worth more than the 10 that was just sitting there.

Black markets have existed since the beginning of civilization. The media who is controlled by the bankers that control this country are going keep bringing these markets up, trying to make it look like bitcoin started the idea of blackmarkets. Selling drugs on the internet is nothing new. Sadly this will keep a lot of people away from it.

I agree. That's just my opinion on how to get it stimulated.  Something really must have chapped your ass regarding BTC. Why would you even go out of your way to make that comment?
