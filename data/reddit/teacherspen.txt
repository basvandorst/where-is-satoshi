How do you access these if you bought on coinbase?

I just saw this on their wiki " If the tippee has not yet connected to ChangeTip, then the tippee is sent a private message with information on how to collect their tip, and tip will be listed as 'Out for Delivery' while the tippee gets connected. If the tippee does not collect the tip, then it is refunded to the tipper automatically after 15 days".... perhaps you didn't collect within those 15 days. I think thats what happened to me as well.

Same thing here. Says I have no account. If you figure it out post an update! Thanks!

Thank you for the reply. That was one of my worries. When you purchased, did it come with an easy set up guide? I've tried looking online for a simple explanation of what steps are involved but couldn't find one. Also, do you need to keep your password for it hidden in a separate place as the device? Sorry, I'm sure thats a silly question

Perfect. Thank you!

Quick question - Someone tipped me a few years ago, but when I click the link it says there is no matching reddit account. Any guesses as to why? I might have withdrawn it but can't remember.

Thanks so much! So if I bought a few months ago, and I transfer it now, did I miss out on the forks that already happened?

Awesome. Someone tipped me some btc a while ago and I never collected it and forgot about it. Was so excited to check on it when I remembered last month and found out that changetip shut down. Fun times!
