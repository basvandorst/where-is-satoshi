@_date: 2014-06-10 02:31:18
Does this mean I can remit money for very little !?
@_date: 2014-06-14 12:15:13
If it gets too hot to mine buy the coin instead.  It's cheaper that way.   No hardware to buy no electricity to pay.   At that point you are speculating the future.  Poker is a fun game.

So to slow down BItcoin make it so long to hash that transactions takes days.  To keep the ledger it takes terabytes ��
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:48:08
More miners from Russia ftw 
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:52:25

@_date: 2017-01-04 01:51:27

When is the next halving 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:14:04
Lagging indicator but more like a confirmation indicator 
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:32:36
I'd say if you bought on 2014 you lagged already.  I'd consider 2010 2011 2012 early adopters

How could you  run a node without getting into a risk of being exposed ?   I read an article where a couple were raided due to being a node 
@_date: 2017-05-15 23:00:29
He said "hmmmm".    Omg he's considering it!
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:20:43
