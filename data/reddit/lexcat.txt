Not a big deal. The NSA already knows your screen names and about those coinbase transactions.

Password was password or an attempt to social engineer us out of bitcoins?

Until someone is lining the politicians in Washington pockets with bitcoins, it is not going to take off.  Money rules Washington. If no to bitcoin money outweighs the yes to bitcoin, it will not stand a chance.

I believe Atlantis was a honeypot. A couple weeks later a SR seizure. In light of this I now  believe this was the case even more.

I had a hard time locating it at first as well. Suddenly, it occurred to me it was right under my nose.

If they can prove one had something to do with SR, yes. The bitcoins spent and generated through SR dealings all may be seized. This includes other items bought with the funds like property, vehicles, electronics, etc.. Most likely the site data will be examined and expect more arrest of users of the site.

Please explain how one can roll up a bitcoin and do a line.  
@_date: 2013-08-04 08:23:02
I will help too. Only way I'll ever have a chance at a full BTC while mining since i just started!

Even though you stated you trust the roommate, when you typed the account was in his name, my first thought was the roomie cleaned out the account. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:05:23
Nope. They'll be seized. Same as a cash, in cases such as these.

Depends on what a bitcoin is worth to you. For some it may be 1$ or may be 1,000,000$ for another.

Yes.
