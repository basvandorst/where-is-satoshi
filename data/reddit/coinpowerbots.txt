If those Bakkt manipulators don't postpone it. The market will most likely dump at the launch of these futures! why..? Precisely because everyone expects it to rise. A pump will probably come after this dump.

libra will never go live! it has been developed for 1 purpose and that is to make governments move to regulation. They have now created a problem (libra) that needs to be solved. it is the same game. and everyone here should know that facebook can never exist without the elite. the libra is a distraction and the goal is to introduce extreme regulations. Bitcoin must be solved and the libra is the starting shot for extreme regulations on bitcoin! once these are introduced, facebook will probably say that they have stopped their project or something like that. everybody knows the game now, right? create a problem (libra) and come up with a solution (extreme regulation) this is mainly focused on bitcoin. I don't know what this guy is smoking but it's not the weed that I can get here..

Uhh yes there is..? you submit all your data with kyc. is it not the whole point of bitcoin to not do this? You talk about "clean money" but bitcoin is seen as "dirty money" regardless of what you do with it. The elite want your info more than ever when it comes to crypto. So for your own safety always try to keep your data in front of you. it is better to pay more to those scammers of those atm's than to those control freaks who apply kyc to our entire community and that way we are all registering.
 
and having said this.
with an ATM you also pay around $ 6 for every transaction regardless of your purchase amount. so this amount comes on top of the already incredible fees they charge.

In Morocco bitcoin is “illegal” and not yellow “restricted”!

like the yellow vests in france that called for a bank run? And while everyone thought the price rose, it suddenly fell, you mean that bank run? Yes, let's repeat it again and believe this nonsense so that the 1% can pull you out. Yes Lets do that again.

Agree !

why your neighbor is not talking about it yet because the old alttime high has not yet been reached. The real FOMO only starts at 20k. we are currently still in a recovery phase. This is also the reason why altcoins are not yet pumping. These will only start pumping when FOMO is created worldwide. And This will only happen once we have recovered from the last alttime high or just before around 18k. Sorry but this is no different than other times it's just bitcoin. these kinds of messages actually cause people to lose money
