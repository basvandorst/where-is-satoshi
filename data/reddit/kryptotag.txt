Thank you for your feedback - I am very new to web design so I know a lot needs to be changed. For the message most people have just been putting "Thank You" or something on the lines of that. I imagine some people using it to say what the bitcoin will be used for or a description of a product if they are selling something. Thanks for looking at the app too.

Okay I just sent you some bits! The point is to make it easy to remember someones bitcoin address - if I see your bitcoin address or QR code and want to send you bitcoins later I will have to look either one of them up. With Kryptotag I would just have to remember that yours is CRYPTY. This makes it easier to advertise on television/radio where you do not have much time to scan a QR code. (In addition to providing advertising for bitcoin by showing people how it can be used) Right now you can only do p2p transactions but the next steps are to create a verified version for companies to sell products / charities to solicit donations.
I will try to explain this better on the website! Thanks for the feedback.

Just sent you 500 bits and you are welcome! Thank you for being the first person to try it out. In order to send bitcoins to someone else using their kryptotag you need the android mobile app. (Search Kryptotag on google play)

Okay I just sent you 500 bits. Do you have any specific design improvements? You can download the kryptotag mobile app if you have an android device then you can send bitcoin to other people by typing in their Kryptotag.
