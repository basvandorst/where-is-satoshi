I'm looking to make a quick deal, because we really need the money to invest in another businessidea. We can manage a lower bid as well even if it means that we'll loose some money Let me know what's possible.

This Thursday a couple of people involved in the bitcoin community will go to the assemblea and make a short presentation. 
No, it's not officially banned but these responses from the central bank and superintendencia de bancos y seguros at least in my interpretation says that it will be very difficult to do anything related to bitcoin as long as we have no official support. The new financial code can easily be used in practice to criminalize bitcoins, it's written very broadly in that sense that it can be used against any cryptocurrency not issued by the central bank of Ecuador. And in there lies a great risk introducing a bitcoinbased business model in Ecuador at this moment.
We'll see what the meeting on Thursday results in, will update the thread.

What if I GIVE it away, does somebody want it then?
It's about $1135 to ship it to the US with FedEx.

The central bank don't make the laws, but the central bank and the superintendencia de bancos y seguros are acting upon the orders they have been given from above by the government. 
The assemblea is where the laws are made and the government are supposed to put the laws into practice.

Even better, I'll give you a %10 commision on the final price excluding shipping if you help me sell it somehow.

Well, information from the outside world is usually filtered through national media since most pepole don't speak English. Bitcoin has not been part of the government propaganda programming so very few people have ever heard about BTC, but there are individuals that are interested in btc even here. Internet is mostly used for facebooking and funny cats on Youtube, online shopping is almost non-existing. Bitcoin could change that.

I wish we could go rouge, but the new financial code that's coming up defines the fines for players other then the Ecuadorian Central Bank" emitting money" and they would crush us financially if we go against them. You don't go against the government in this type of political climate unless you are highly masochistic and enjoy being punished and humiliated.
