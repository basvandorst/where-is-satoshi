So... the supposed idea behind ~~stealing~~ 'forfeiting' cash is that anyone carrying large quantities of physical is acting suspiciously and could potentially be transporting criminal proceeds. Whereas keeping your whole life savings on a debit card is normal for a lot of people. What possible justification could they have for seizing it? I can't see how this is anything other than legalized piracy.

The [Bitcoin.com news section]( gets my "most improved" vote for crypto news in 2016.

In a nutshell: no, it's gone.

Mow is too chicken to debate Roger in person, his main skill is Twitter trolling.

I wish it was, but they're talking about the deal you get with loyalty points there.

I'm like "Bitcoin is always on the front page!" - and then I realized I only ever read bitcoin subs.

Ha ha, you won't get both sides of the story here.

The tax discount is for non-residents, they wouldn't give that to locals.

Having to explain it is the fun part :)

So Satoshi just handed the alert keys to some random guy because he got bored?

Banks: Technology aimed at rendering us obsolete may present a risk. Of course, it's been a long time since banks were interested in anything to do with consumer accounts anyway.

Sometimes I wonder if being the most popular BTC exchange is a kind of poisoned chalice. You're a constant target for something or other whether it's hackers, banks or regulators.

This is Actually Good News.

Well PwC have been [encouraging their clients]( to pay their staff in Bitcoin, so I'd say they get it too.

If you say 'blockchain' three times fast, and notarize it with a service like Factom, history will record from now until the heat death of the universe that you said it at that exact place &amp; time, and you will never be able to claim otherwise.

Nice to see someone being so honest about the role Bitcoin plays in all this, and publicly so.

I lost a whole 0.1 BTC like that -- even wrote down the password, can't for the life of me figure out how/where I got it wrong. If that 0.1 is ever worth a substantial amount of money in future, I might try &amp; get an expert to crack it (since I'm pretty sure I have it 99% right). But it's not worth the effort/expense yet.

The concept of this is just too weird for anyone outside East Asia to understand.

We'll forget about it when we're allowed to have other alternatives. At the moment, our overlords still insist we use clunky old credit/debit cards.

That chart you linked to has the Pirate Party clearly in the lead.

Dude... it's CoinTelegraph. No-one has taken them seriously as a crypto news source since, well, forever really. Maybe they had one or two good writers in the past but most of the stuff there now is just beat-ups, conjecture, or straight-out plagiarism from other sites, all written in weird English. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:00:38
Ah. Well even if they're not technically the largest, they're still going to be a powerful force in the parliament.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:38:40
Yeah it's like, instead of needing to send cash to relatives back home, you can just pay their bills with BTC instead.

I agree, if someone ever asked me "would you rather live to see the first human land on Mars, or VR porn?" I'd have to go for the porn.

Sometimes seeing crap like this makes me want to drop everything worthwhile I do and just start selling dreams to the gullible.
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:55:02
Ha, that actually makes it 10x better

Oh man... when this thing goes down it's going to be a humanitarian crisis. Life savings lost, divorces, families broken up, probably suicides. I wonder how many they've duped &amp; how much money has poured into it.

I gained weight in Japan because the portions are so small I always had to order two meals.

I suspect some premium tycoons are gonna feel very un-tycoonish very soon.

Also were they metric droves or the American kind? I think metric ones have fewer people.

mini-review: tried it, nice app, good to see Chinese companies making bitcoin products for the international market. English interface could do with some polish but everything works OK.

Totally real, I was there &amp; saw it all.

Well he's been charged with embezzlement &amp; Japan has a 99%+ conviction rate, so I hope he still has his cat minder's phone number. That said, corporate crimes in Japan usually get you a slap on the wrist, a promotion and probably a seat in parliament so he should be OK.
