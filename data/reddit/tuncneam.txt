I'm kind of against prints/digital reproductions due to my personal code of principles in my artwork-- to me part of the worth of a work is that it is novel, or unique. Even when I make multiples I make woodcuts and print each with the ink applied by palette knife so that each becomes a hybrid monoprint of sorts. I'm a relic in an age of mass production/simple replication and don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I love Beuys and plenty of artists who produce multiples, it's just not my bag.
(3) is a fantastic idea.
(5 on) A DAO is an interesting idea, but I'd like to see more maturity in the concept-- and I see the same opportunities under a different moniker with a number of alts most notably Devcoin. My concern is also I prefer to be egalitarian whenever possible (that's why every work is the same price and, frankly, dirt cheap) and the idea of crowd-funding in any hierarchical manner leaves a bad taste in my mouth. There is a lot to think about here and definitely plenty of opportunity.
I appreciate your thoughtful response, cheers!

Thanks for the solid feedback! Those are definitely ideas I need to incorporate into the site. I'm going to muse over a tasteful way to offer a "pay with BTC" discount.

It's a way to differentiate between a carpenter and a poet. [Wiki](

Glad you noticed! Hopefully you were able to take advantage of the +1500% bump SXC took shortly after this post :)
