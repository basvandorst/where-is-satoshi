Download this 
Find "index.html" in the downloaded file and doubleclick on it
Now you will be led to a website. This website is the "tool".
You will see "Dark Wallet Passphrase" right at the top.
Enter your wallets passphrase in this field. (The passphrase is the strange word sequence you will need to remember, when you create a wallet)
Then change the m/0'/0/0 "Custom Path" area to be m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 and see if that's your address below.
If it is, you can use the keys provided below to sweep them to an Electrum wallet.
That's done by opening the Electrum exe and clicking on wallet -&gt; private keys -&gt; sweep
Enter key provided by the tool's website.
Let "Address" unchanged and then click on "sweep" 
Hope that works. Good luck and sorry for accidentaly letting you wait for so long!

Thanks for the recommendation!
Well, other wallet services don't take my Dark Wallet's private key for some reason... is it even possible, to export keys, without the wallet-server being online?
Thanks a lot anyways.
EDIT: Oh yeah! And also is it still possible to recieve bitcoin on an imported key in the source wallet?
