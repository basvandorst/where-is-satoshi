This doesn't sound like bubble talk to you?

No one said he was all knowing. Also I don't think anyone in 1996 saw what apple was going to become.

Well for every seller there has to be a buyer.

Not likely. I don't see the value in bitcoin if it doesn't have the ability to really purchase things. If it is just held as an investment like gold it makes no sense.
Why don't people invest in pieces of paper that I sign? It would be the same principle. Bitcoin isn't a physical product and therefor only gains its value for ease of transactions and crypto nature being able to hide from the state. Take those away and bitcoin never would have went anywhere.

Electronic prices and quality are deflationary though, at time of purchase. Why buy a computer today when you can get a better one for the same price next month? And so on as the argument goes. People don't have a high enough time preference to not buy computers or electronics. In a deflationary money system people won't be able to either.

Since it went up to $900 dollars at some point and then proceeded to lose about 44% of value I'd say that is a pop.

So fake. FDR is standing up.

I'm all for 100K, but I don't see that as rational. I don't see something built on hype being worth insane amounts of money. Same goes for Gold or silver.

It happened? I don't actually follow bitcoin prices that closely. 
Edit- Just looked at the price and it was $505. Guess I did good. I think we'll start to see acceleration up in price though. Bitcoin is getting a lot of media etc. It does depend on how many people are weak kneed and sell.

Nothing wrong with that. Pocket your profit and keep your money for investing back in when it dips again. Set a point for it to reach and sell it when it reaches that point and then wait for another dip. Rinse and repeat.

Bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme, because bit coin isn't an investment/speculatative tool. It is a crypto currency that allows anonymous purchases and tax evasion. 
It's a currency not backed up by a commodity, but by a service.

Interesting response. I like your point about them not purchasing bitcoin. I think two other great examples would be stockmarkets and electronics.
Historically the stock market is deflationary too. So why doesn't everyone save up every nickel and penny they have and purchase index funds and never spend any money? 
Electronics are deflationary, but I'm sure the author has a computer and a cell phone and maybe a tablet. Why did he buy all those things when he did and not wait a year? And when that year came why not wait another year? 
The middle part seemed a little preachy, but I picked up a new argument and a new  perspective. A-

"See, in just the last month, one bitcoin has gone from closing at a then-record $192 to reaching $788 on Monday."
Someone can't read a graph they put in their own article. Several months before bitcoin was over $200. Derp. This person really pays attention to details. Volatility seems pretty reasonable with it being in the news, more people joining, and a shit ton of speculators. 
Why not let it go farther before making a judgment call? Things are just starting to pick up and it had to start somewhere. It couldn't just be adopted by people, stores, and governments all in a day therefor removing a lot of the volatility. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:37:51
I think this is pretty ridiculous. Bitcoin is so young and you are making fun of people that for waiting a few months? Give me a break. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:05:37
Wouldn't it be exponential since this is a logarithmic graph? 
The main thing to remember is you should never expect exponential growth to continue.

My opinion is you shouldn't invest in crypto currencies. They're a tool for evasion. You should use a crypto currency to evade the state. Whether that means long term holdings or short term holdings is up to you. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:26:52
The words norm and bitcoin don't go together. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:56:44
Or you spend them when you need something and then just buy more bitcoins later, like when you get paid. Tons of people do that, but with USD. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:01:22


Very high and noble of you, but I think efforts to sensor Nazi propaganda or propaganda from other governments is perfectly fine.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:34:15
What makes you say right now though, and not sometime down the road say two decades or more? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:59:54
The bubble will probably pop at +/- $100 of a thousand dollars a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:35:30
I don't own bitcoin. I'm just a poor college student. If I did have bitcions of course I would have sold. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:09:52


No you don't. Likely the best deal will be right before you die, but you aren't going to wait right tell you die to spend all your bitcion. 
You obviously overlooked/didn't understand my computer example. Why did you buy your electronic device when you did and not wait another year? Obviously you have a time preference. Hence why even in deflationary money it is still spent.

I feel like that should be extra credit, unless you were trying to be a dick. Which is probably what a lot of teachers would have thought. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:48:48
Plot twist! Large inflation ruins the dollar and a million USD is only worth about $5k in today's money. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:33:20
Based off of what quantifiable analysis? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:48:27


Well depending on how low it goes you might be real mad at yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:02:47
Because the deflationary argument is absurd. There is such a thing as time preference and you will want something some day and you will spend bitcoin for it. 
Here is a perfect example. Why did you buy the computer or mobile device you are using right now? Why didn't you wait a year or two for the price to be cut in half or the power to double? At that year or two point why wouldn't you wait again another year or two? And so on. The fact that the electronics industry exists at all is proof positive that a market can successfully operate in a deflationary environment. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:50:13
Wild manipulation? If bitcoin is too wild west for you or anyone else feel free to enter the stock market, hold precious metals, or just USD. The point of bitcoin is that it is unregulated. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:45:07
They started investing when the were around $15, so I'm going out on a limb and saying they've probably made a profit. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:17:56
But why did you buy the electronic device you are using now? Why didn't you wait? You have time preference. As shown by your first sentence. 
I've proven you wrong, have a good day. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:04:41
Exactly what line of evidence draws you to the conclusion that the whole fiat system is on the verge of meltdown?
