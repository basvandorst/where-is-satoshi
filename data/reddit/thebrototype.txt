True, ETH is appearing more and more to be a good hedge against BTC corrections. I own both.

Yep, I used to be a big believer in Peter Schiff but now I think he's the definition of "a broken clock is right twice a day." In 2011-12 he was claiming we were heading for a big double dip recession and then the stock market ripped higher on one of the biggest bull runs in history. If you followed his advice (like I did) you would've missed out. When the stock market finally does correct, he'll say he was right all along, even tho it's years after his original prognostication. Used to have a lot of respect for the guy, now I just think he's a gold shill and a blind perma-bear.

I've toyed with the idea of making a Flurbo coin.

I think the dollar will more or less be fine. I'm not investing in BTC because I think the dollar will collapse. I think crypto is a better form of currency, but I don't think it's success needs to be tied to the demise of fiat. Some in the community (looking at you Max Keiser) seem to be pushing that narrative, but I think it actually hurts the crypto community. I don't think crypto needs to be tied to any agenda (libertarians, dollar demise people etc.). The more we push certain narratives on to crypto, the less universal the crypto thesis becomes.

The ultimate measure of a man is not how he hodls in times of comfort and convenience, but how he hodls in times of adversity and challenge.

Krugman's disparagement is a conviction buy signal for me.

More fake news from mainstream media, what a surprise.
