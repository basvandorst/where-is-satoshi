Yes BTC is obviously on it's way to $0,00
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:40:25
Why would Bitcoin never reach the level of adoption it received over the last couple months? I remember people saying that when it went from 400 to 2k and dropped back to 1k.
Also when it went from 3k to 7k and back to 5k...
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:27
It has always been like that... And makes absolutly no difference. Let these people sell their coins and take their profit while the world slowly learns about economics. That's what a correction is (short term traders taking their profits). In other words, you can say Bitcoin is over for those who think of it as a pump coin or a way to make easy money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:45
the way you talk seems like this is the biggest correction of all times... it's 10% bigger than the 40% corrections we were having (we are at -47% of the ATH right now) and exactly 30 days on a "downtrend" (July's corrections took like 34)
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:47
Exactly, all It matters is the amount you invest.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:22:00
Keep thinking you are a god and that trading is easy... I heard that's exactly what the guy who lost 300 BTC was thinking when he made 300 out of 2.

Bitcoin is a better kind of money than any other the world has ever seen. That's all you have to know about it.

I'm not a sheep by your definiton because I'm a full time trader but I don't think I'm better than anyone because of that. I also know that trading is a more risky way to invest than holding and some people just like to take less risks.

The price of the unity is irrelevant since you can buy fractions and since what really matters is the value of the market
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:51
Well I still think you got nothing about the idea of Bitcoin. First of all, you are talking about the end of an speculation and not the end of the real idea. If the point is to be used as a currency with no inflation and no centralized government, why would the (less) possibility of the price growth make you think bitcoin is over? Again, you sound like someone who believes BTC's objective is to double it's price every week so people can make profit on it. It's not.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:34:58
BTC isn't deflating for at least the next 120 years...
And you should research inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:25:03
He already said that people use their BTC to buy and invest in other stuff right now, why would they stop doing that if the markets tends to stabilize more and more as it grows?

@_date: 2018-05-14 14:49:59
You are getting things wrong. Hyper inflation isn't natural but you and 99% of the society think that's cool. BTC is gaining value against fiat because it's new - any new asset will grow exponentially as it becomes mainstream, and that would also happen if we were still living under a gold monetary policiy. And yes, the governments and their friends steals people when they print money.
PS: I do not own a house, but why don't you ask a venezuelan if he prefers hyper inflation or just a stable economy where he can save whatever he wants from his salary?
PS2: Houses are horrible example as lands are scarce and will always appreciate. We don't need inflation to do that.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:57:48

@_date: 2018-05-14 20:52:26
There is nothing wrong with wage constantly going down... That's the whole point, how did you not get it? Venezuelans are getting exponential growth on their wages, should they be living better than USA?
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:32:38
Housing market crash happened exactly because of inflation caused by the FED through easy credit. And obviously, during the crash, prices deflated. And the dollar itself didn't deflate during the crashes - bush and obama printed more dollars than ever in US history. You are again getting things backwards.
The value of assets can grow without inflation - that happens if the demand increases. Creating value out of thin air is EXACTLY what printing money is. You should study some economics.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:31:58
Are you telling me prices getting cheaper isn't good? Lol keynesians
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:50:58
I'm talking from a monetary perspective. And you know we are all talking about the situation where prices decrease because of a loss on the monetary supply. Anyway, you said that BTC's policy for the next 100 years will be deflation, and this is false as you can't even be sure that prices will keep falling against BTC for the next 100 years.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:48:59
Yes, if the population increases and the amount of money stays the same, each person should get less amount of money over time. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that... Doesn't matter if a person has 1 dolar or 1 trillion dollar, what matters is how much goods and services someone can buy with a certain amount of money. That's why you get things backwards. You don't create value by printing money you create value producing stuff and services.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:47:44
Fork isn't inflation and we don't need inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-14 23:26:01
USA and German both faced deflation for 2 decades at the end of XIX century and still, people had enjoyed such a great economic growth that it led to the first big crisis of the socialist theory. I don't have to convince people, this happens naturally. BTC is here to stay, the era of inflation is coming to an end.

You sound like a very jealous person. Most of people from this sub was already here when btc was 1k. Crashes and people getting liquidated trading happens on every market - since ever. If you dont know that the joke is on you.

Dont buy it then. So far everyone who ever bought btc and held for the long term has made a lot of money...

I dont get it. We dont know how much hashpower LTC has?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:27:43
Negative for u who bought it at 20k, lets not forget this sub was already big when btc was 1k...
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:46:04
No, if he only did that he wouldnt have got liquidated. He tried to trade and thats different than holding. And holding btc long term is one of the best advices he could get.
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:12:45
I either didnt understand this right or this is fucking huge
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:27:46
But this could happen with other pow coins too, right? With btc is much harder because of the great amount of hashpower but this could be done with LTC, for example?

But the confidence on that debt is based on the fact that the US will always pay their debts (as they always did, by printing money). And right now they either print tenths of trillions of dollars or don't pay it. That is impossible to happen with BTC. I don't think anyone is ever going to be dumb enough to lend products/service and hope to be paid 180 millions BTC for it.

@_date: 2018-02-02 05:44:51
No, they deleted 30 million more of USDT after the panic started... And I'm not a Tether supporter, only way I use it is to short it
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:46:30
I think 2019 will be the stocks crash (which is already happening) but that will make the dollar a little stronger on the short term. Things will start to get messy when they cut rates and start QE rounds again and that will probably happen by 2020 or 21...
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:51:15
Hm I would guess over 1.4b are fakes... Those are the ones printed in huge waves since november. But you also have to remember how was the market from 1 to 3 months ago... I do believe hundreads of millions and probrably billions flowed into Tether in that period... And I'm very certain that billions of dollars flowed into crypto through other exchanges that deal directly with fiat like coinbase and bithumb.
Yes that one seems like the "main" wallet but they have some others like this one:
over 200m tether moved yesterday

Last transaction of the issuer wallet was a "Revoke Tokens" of 30M USDT to an address "Tokens Deleted".
I'm a day trader so my job will continue weather it hits 20k or 2k... As for my long term investments I'm not worried at all. Tether collapse is great for cryptos in the long term. I just don't think it will collapse.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:00:55
I know people with millions worth of it, and people who already cashed out millions.
I also invested like R$2.000 (2015), cashed out more than R$40.000 and still have most of my coins.
Oh, and as a day trader I made 300 dollars yesterday (sometimes 500, sometimes -50, but around 3k a month). And no, not counting the 2.5k recover from last week - which made me a few thousands.

Same thing every year bla bla bla even if they don't have enough dollars to back the Tethers they have investors with money to back them. This is FUD until someone proves it or they stop paying withdrawals.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:45:26
-1. I know you didn't state bots are new, but they have been there for year and not only on BTC. The point is, we don't see assets "dying" because of bots.
2. Bots are increasing in number, the traders are increasing in number, the money flowing to the market is increasing... The market is growing, we are obviously going to see more of everything.
3. No one loses money because of bots if they don't wish to withdrawal their investments in a short term. You are, again, saying that bots are causing a downtrend and that is making people lose money. That's not true, bots or not this was a healthy and needed correction.
I'm not saying crypto will lose vollatility when it grows because of the stock market... That happens with absolutely every asstet in the world, it's just one of the most simple economics principle... High volumes tends to find a "medium" price. (Actually, that is applied to everything when it comes to a medium point.)
When I talk about the true value of BTC I mean, if this is the technology that is going to replace the fiat system, the value of it isn't what we are seeing right now. It also isn't represented by everyone who buys and sells it looking for some short profit - everyone knows that doesn't work and any asset surviving only on this is faded to die. All these pumps and dumps, FOMO and FUD is just BTC building it's way to the mainstream. If bots and short traders can kill the market, this theory is wrong and BTC is just a pump and dump asset which isn't even worth the risk of investing in.
Anyway, I'm pretty sure this correction wasn't caused by any bots. Too many new and short traders came looking for profits and thinking BTC would become full mainstream in a couple weeks. We've seen volumes 100x higher than 1 year before, prices 20-30x higher. Anyone who thinks it's dead because of that drop should really leave the market and stop risking it's money on a short period. And who knows, maybe january 2019 they will learn their lessons hehe
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:44:11
Stupid research. You can't even know how much BTC someone owns. Data analysis doesn't tell you if someone owns more than 1 wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:35:02
What if they already bought back all the Tethers printed? And what if they did print Tether to buy crypto but they have someone to back the, at least at some level?
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:52:19
No you didn't but you used the topic that fit better with what you were trying to say, even that been false. We are not talking about the difference between paper money and money on banks systems. Doesn't matter what money market accounts invesnts in, they are accounts holding currencies and paying interest rates to their owners. Accounts holding money.
As I told you already, I'm talking about dollars and how there are hundreads of trillions of them out there on circulating money and debts and I think everyone knows even with 120389123 millions researches you can't accurately tell how many dollars exists at the moment. And that's not the point.
"What I mean and what I'm trying to say" is there are at least 200 trillion dollars gap waiting for a currency to take it's place in case the fiat currencies ever fail and cryptos takes its place. If I haven't made that clear in the first comment I don't know how to.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:41:50
I've been watching it the last few days and I found 3 or 4 wallets. I can only find 3 of them right now and there are over 700M all together.
How can you tell how much of the 2.2b Tethers are fake ones and how much of them are actually backed by 1 dollar bought by a client?
edit: I'm pretty sure I didn't find all the wallets, lol

That's a 16-18 trillion market cap, around 2.2-2.5x current gold mkt cap... But if we ever defeat fiat currencies, let's not forget there are like 200 trillion dollars out there.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:59:20
Government backed = they can print as many as they want. And you are calling Tether a scam exactly because of that.

If you didnt laugh at this you are not ready to buy yet
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:23:44
Here is my source: 
I'm talking about dollar not global debts... Anyway, I think I made my point: there are hundreads of trillions of dollars around the world. Doesn't matter if they aren't actually printed, if the US government is getting services/products in exchange of debts just because everyone knows they own the power of printing money it is the same as printing money, in terms of mkt value.
Total amount of currency in the world is about 7.6 trillion of what? Didn't get that
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:52:01
Same thing with BTC. People expect a huge increase in the value in the next years/decades because it's new but that doesn't mean they won't (or don't) sell and buy things with BTC. Also, lots of governments, companies and people holds billions and trillions of dollars as investments. It's just the safest investment in the world... Or was.

Why are you so pissed? I think you bought ATH and sold at 6k and now you are just pretending to be a day trader here hahaha.
Say whatever you want. People say it's impossible for BTC to grow since it's 1 cent and we have reached 20k. If it ever breaks 1-2T mkt cap and governments start joining the boat I'm pretty sure there is no way dollar can hold it's value. Fiat is for losers.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:38:35
700m total but I'm almost sure there was one more with over 300m. Seems like they bought 200-300m yesterday.

@_date: 2018-02-13 19:23:37
Your argument is basically "people only buy BTC because they want profit next month and no one is going to buy it after a downtrend (caused by bots)"
If people only buy BTC because they want profit next month BTC was never really alive. And bots or not, there is not a single asset in the world that doesn't go through market trends before losing vollatility as it becomes massively adopted.
People can day trade and try to win against the market but your mistake is to think these people holds the true value of BTC... And I bet thousands of ppl already said the same thing you posted here, specially on 2014 "Market manipulation, no liquidity, people buying expecting huge profits and bots causing a downtrend and no one is going to buy it anymore"
Edit: no, bot isn't a new thing and you didn't need a bot to sell it at the 20k peak.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:04:56
And 90 trillion held on debts - that we know of.

@_date: 2018-02-02 04:55:19
I've been watching it too. Also searching for Bitfinex adresses at Tether explorer you can find out they bought back almost 700m last 3 or 4 days. I think they are buying back their Tethers after they got rekt trying to trade with printed money. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:58:39
Why doesn't the same thing apply to the dollar?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:56:58
Hahahahahah bunch of fools
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:17:31
That's not correct. As humans we can also learn things through logic and cryptocurrencies can't be compared to the Tulips or stock markets because it's a currency and not something that 100% of its value is based on speculation of prices growth. The fact that Bitcoin may become mainstream and used as currency to buy stuff and store value makes it different than any other bubble case. Even when compared to fiat crises, it is different because we don't have inflation, characterisct present on every fiat crises.
The real question is: will BTC become mainstream? If not, it's just a bubble. If yes, market cap should go over trillions.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:57:46
The ones who stay with fiat are the losers
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:26:45
So you actually believe that money is only the one printed on paper or metal? Because your own source says there are 90.4 trillion on banks accounts...
And I guess I was wrong about the US debt, not 90 trillion, only 70. I added national debt to total debt and that was my mistake.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:44:17
I did sell some - bought them back at 9.520, sold at 9.680, bought again at 9.120 and waiting to buy more if it breaks 9k. But none of these trades were made because of your "advice"... I see people claiming they have programs that predicts the future, people claiming they are gods because of technical analysis and people saying BTC will drop, over 50 times everyday. You are just one more of those sheeps.
PS: if you check some Tether adresses, you can see Bitfinex is buying them back. Over 300 million the last couple days, 700m total from the last week - and those are only the ones I found. Add this to the fact that they are under investigation and you come to the conclusion that they printed Tether during the 3-20k pump and now they have to fix the balances. Logical thinking and a few experience on charts analysis and you won't need programs to know when to sell.
PS2: "exact"BtcTrading missed "next stop" for 2k and 2 days, so far... I see how exact your program is.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:36:34
I never said you think you are a god because you are trading, I said you think you are a god because of the way you talk. Trading isn't easy, making a few bets and getting it right makes any noob trader thinks he is invincible like you do. Saying you are better than others because you trade and calling them "sheeps" is just ridiculous.
And no, I did not search about your program, don't even care about it - all I know is you are bragging all over reddit about how you were right on 2 out of 150 drops btc made last month. It also didn't touch your price yet (7k) and I sold the amount I use for day trade yesterday at 10.200 because I saw Bitfinex is buying back their Tether. No math, no program.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:52:03
So even if the dollar starts collapsing because of BTC adoption, you won't buy it back?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:15:43
Hahaha agreed
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:07:06
Not all people use Bitcoin to escape 100% from third party. No inflation and the fact that its still a growing market are characteristics that make a lot of people use Bitcoin and still use a third party on their daily transactions.

No problem but what money?

I think it's good to watch them for a while... If at some point the market finds a bottom and this tethers start leaving the wallets again...

"mimimi blablabla sold at 6k now im cryinng mimimi"
don't worry buddy you may have a chance to get it back at 6k but I wouldn't count too much on it

No it's not. Even if all those "bad guys" wanted to do the worst thing with BTC (to destroy it, by manipulating the price or whatever) they wouldn't be able to. All they can do is buy and sell and there is nothing wrong with that. And you are looking at the picture from the wrong side: as the market grows it becomes harder to manipulate, not easier.

Ask him if he is going to share his amount in case he gets the assets. Those 120 BTC will be in his pocket very soon man hahaha
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:36:44
You cant be sure of that

There are other comments where he implies that any money he would get in the future would be lost to taxes. He is saying if he receives the money he won't share it.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:03:34
Oh so if you get the money you will keep it because it will be too expensive to split it back to the victims?
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:18:43
I think you are a liar, I think MTGox tryed to trade those BTC's during this last 4 months and is still trying. This post is something like "Hahahah bunch of idiots we took your money, crashed the market twice and you all paid us billions of dollars for that! Thanks and don't forget we will crash the market again in the near future!"
I just hope you all sell those coins trying to crash the market and get rekt at some point.

No it's not, it's about probability and risk management. Knowing where supports and resistances are and working on them makes you have a better % of success. It's impossible to know for sure what price it's going to hit, specially tomorrow's price and if your several friends tell you that, they either don't know what TA is or don't care about explaning it to you.

Well there is always a good side: now you can use your billions to open another company (like an exchange), get stolen after you accumulate hundreads of thousands of client's bitcoins and lock in that money to liquidate at some point in the future, pay the victims and keep some other billions!
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:49:14
You don't know what TA is if you think it's about predicting prices.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:47:56
If you are a good guy, when you receive your money you will split it with all MTGox vitcims. Wouldn't keep anything from those coins.
That's an idea, right? If you are such a good guy who doesn't want to make profit because of your mistakes that led to other people losses, who doesn't want to indirectly steal from your clients (because if you keep the money that's exactly what you will be doing) you should just give them back their money even if the government gives it to you.

see you at 30k when you buy the top again
btw last few months stocks are like in the same situation as crypto

He came here to brag. He is showing us how they fucked everybody and got paid for that.
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:34:26
That's basically a bet, because to get out of there you'd have to pay 6% more for a BTC that you won't get it back.
Some people just prefer to risk and keep it there. Others even would want to sell for USD there and wait for the dust to settle and try profit a little bit...

Is it easy to buy/sell btc there? Do you think its possible to have a btc based economy or is the government able to stop people from using it?
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:10:57
And they don't bother to investigate the bank that caused all this shit right??
