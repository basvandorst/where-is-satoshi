So the only field where Bitcoin is useful is in the Cryptocurrencies?
Because, when i did some research on the web i found some said that it can be used in:
Healthcare, IoT, Insurance, Real Estate, Supply Chain, Contracts. But i didn't understand how, and how can miners mine and what will be the Reward and why using a Peer to Peer instead of having a centralized entity and who will be the miners?

Social media for example, how can blockchain work? Who will be the miners and what will be reward? and what will be stored in the ledger?

Yes, i'm totally agree with you. What i wanted to know is how the proof of work is done on those "Blockchain" like technologies, since the Blockchain is supposed to be P2P so how can a company use it ? and who can be the miners?

Well understood..
Thank youu

For those examples that you have cited, how does the proof of work work, and are they decentralised ? if yes, how are the miners?
Please, if you can, i want just a small example of a use of that :)

That doesn't answer to the applications of Blockchain question

Smart contracts is one of the applications of Blockchain as i read. And it's still not convincing cause i don't know how to get miners and do the proof of work in that case (since there will be no reward as the Bitcoin protocol gives)

That was the point of the question. Because i saw that many websites that put donate button via bitcoin, they have always the same address, Is that mean that they don't generate the keys? And also for the ransomwares, there is only one fixed address. So all transactions are sent to the same address?
Is that right?

Making new address means making new wallet? Right? So you have to store all the keys of all the wallets?
Then for example if i have 2 wallets, each one of them has 0.5BTC. And i want to send you 1BTC. How can i do that if the 2 wallets are separated?
