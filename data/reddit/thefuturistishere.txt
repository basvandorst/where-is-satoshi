I like your verbage. This is pretty much what I do with some of my income now but it's going to EJ, I just need to figure out which app for Bitcoin would work best for me and start putting some there.

I grew up poor, like 1 head of iceberg lettuce for dinner sometimes poor, red water from rusted pipes in slumlord farm homes poor. Because of this way of life growing up, money is weird to me now. I work full time at a little more than double minimum wage per hour and it barely covers the bills and I'm not even in a metropolitan area. I work side jobs with photography to earn money for the more fun stuff like weekend travels to national parks sort of stuff. Diversifying is my goal, I don't want it all sitting in just stocks. In total its not enough to put towards land or apartment/home ownership though.

Read: agoraphobia due to severe trauma in my op.
You don't know how much I wish things were different for me back then. A mentally unstable stalker that took things to the next level is something I wouldn't wish on anyone. Cops could never keep him locked up for more than a week. Anytime I left the house he found me, everytime I changed phone numbers, he'd get it somehow and call nonstop for hours from random numbers. Would break into my house and things were just bad, to worse, to unspeakable. So I eventually moved in with parents and stopped working or going out at all until I recovered which took a few years. So mining without a computer and buying in with no money wasn't exactly feasible. So no, I don't feel sick for not buying in back then because I was in a shitty situation that I've since crawled out from through hard work and determination. But yes, I regret not buying a few months ago when I put Bitcoin back on my radar.

My aim is to not make any emotional decisions, hence why I've been trying to do research and gain a better understanding of how it works these days in better detail and why I'm trying to get advice from those who know more than me since I pushed bitcoin out of my mind for several years until more recently.

Thank you for the advice, ideally I wouldn't want to put more than 15% of my money into bitcoin atm. That much shouldn't affect me long term in any way.

Are you here for a troll toll?

Luckily I have found happiness, I'm easily the happiest I've ever been in my life over the past few years, and it feels great. All of this is a relatively minor thing in a way, I don't want to lose what my grandfather worked hard to leave for me. It would also be nice to have more backup funds for a medical issue I have that could cost me a bit someday.

I will watch, thanks!

Thank you for the suggestions!

It's more so that I took my uncle's advice, and he doesn't even know what cryptocurrency is, and I took my EJ advisors advice, who advocates against cryptocurrencies, and after essentially ignoring my inheritance for the past couple years to let it do its thing I've been wanting to finally get into Bitcoin now that I'm in a place where I can. I'm only feeling the regret of not buying a few months ago when I first started thinking I should.

I think if I had bought in some weeks ago, I would just let it be and see where it goes for a while. Sucks that you lost your initial amount though!

I know I must.
