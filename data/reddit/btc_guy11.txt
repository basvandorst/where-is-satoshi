The user name isn't helping either

This is going to happen everywhere at risk of deposit haircuts. The capital outflow from the euro periphery is going to be what leads to bailouts being required. Such a joke

Exactly. Thanks.

'Has' is actually correct in this case. It refers to the 'Quarter' (singular), not the 'consumers' (plural).

DON'T TELL ME TO SETTLE DOWN

Yea that's what it seems like. I think the concern is that there's plenty of businesses and even individuals with money over that amount who are at risk of bailing out the bank

Many folks are dead set in traditional ways of thinking that would indicate this is necessary. It just shows how deeply ingrained these types of thoughts are in our society.

The author notes that it's after the market settled which makes sense - unfortunately there's limited data available for bitcoin. I'm not sure what there is to 'not buy' in a 0.9 correlation over 7 weeks. I'd imagine this changes over time. It's still a young currency.

uhhh... wat?

Agreed. There's a huge difference between centralized and decentralized when it comes to virtual currencies. One is a single company/person with an agenda, the other is a network of people buying into an idea.

Just shows how much room for growth is left

This has been a huge week for the libertarian movement. DOMA passes, drug site openly advertising, countries across the globe coming out in support of Snowden in the face of the US government. Rock on.

The subject of the sentence is 'A quarter.' There are many people in the group, but it is a singular group and the verb is conjugated accordingly. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 18:38:26
Seriously. That was some pretty deep stuff.

It still doesn't say how they found the guy. Just goes from ransom to caught. Anyone have any further info?

Meh, everything's a scam until it's not. The same thing was said about ASICMiner when they were anonymous at first. Now with bigger dividends every week people have pulled back. Same with BFL not shipping. They're still getting pre-orders.
Like anything in bitcoin mining - buyer beware.

he is running that operation perfectly. other btc companies need to take example from him
