Transaction fees are based not on the amount you spend, but on the size of the transaction you broadcast. The size of the transaction (in kb) depends on the number of *inputs* the transaction is made of.   
**An easy way to understand is like this:**  
Bob sends you 1 bitcoin. Amy sends you another bitcoin. You now have 2 Bitcoin, composed of 2 inputs. If you then send that 2 bitcoins on in one transaction, you get charged the "fee per input" price which is currently the minimum to actually get your transaction processed. Right now, that appears to be around $30 per input.     
.   
So, to go back to my post, if you have received $30 to your wallet (as one chunk), you will need to spend the whole amount on the fees and be left with nothing to actually *send*. There are many people who have received a few dollars of bitcoin at a time and have say $500 made of 100 inputs. They would need to spend $3000 in fees to move that $500, so that money is basically stuck.  
It's a very real problem, and if Bitcoin evolves into pure settlement layer with no reduction in fees, there really needs to be some solution for these people, as they have otherwise basically lost those funds forever unless a very very low fee day comes around. It would be great to fix that problem for early adopters who used bitcoin in good faith.   
Someone will be along to tell me they should have sweeped the transactions earlier, but hindsight is 20-20 and not it doesnt change the fact that we are we are right now

1 input per $30 : may never be able to spend or withdraw, fees higher than their balance  
  
1 input per $60 : will only lose half of their funds when they spend    
1 input per $120 : will only lose 1 quarter of their funds when they spend    
1 input per $240 : can actually spend their funds and only lose 12.5% of their funds!  
1 input per $480+ : are actually able to use Bitcoin!      
If you bought/received bitcoin before the fees ramped up, sorry bad luck, thankyou for playing though!    
Think twice before downvoting, this is a real problem. I am against BCH and continual block size inceases, but that doesnt mean Bitcoin is in a good situation right now.
