I've had no issues with them. I think they are the biggest bitcoin poker site. The stakes vary from micro up.

10% is nothing, go sell your stuff in an auction and see what the auction house charges. always shits on eBay, should they be giving you a service for free? That's like going to the gas station and getting mad when they charge you for the gas.

You said 10% is laughable, I said 10% is cheap compared to other options.
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:38:44

Stupid question, im assuming i should be looking at trade history for "last price" is that correct? and what are the % on the currency selector. awesome site. bte-c has been killing me recently. ive been relying on bitcoin paranoid on my phone for prices
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:23:19
They charge 10% now. but look at a normal auction house and 10% isnt that bad.
