Just know that libertarians have been predicting the crash of the dollar since before the internet existed.

Buying some bitcoin and going to doesn't make you an investment professional.

It was just a printout the ad that was posted here a few weeks ago, I and few other people printed some out to distribute.
Here is what it looks like: 
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:42:49
Oh crap sorry, when I googled the price for 1 coin a few hours ago it was $350, now its $340.Same question though, are they really worth $3400?

It was the Jlaw/Apple pic that got upvoted to the front page.

You're trolling right? Please tell me you didn't actually do this....
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:40:40




Then do business with a better bank. This has nothing to do with bitcoin.

As a paid Western Union shill, I have to say the most effective way to combat me is to upvote me. I get paid by the downvote, since 1 downvote = 1 person reading my comment and making an effort to dislike it. My employer does not like upvotes however, my supervisor says that if someone is upvoting my post here on then I am not doing my job correctly.

Hey thanks for the link heres some bitcoin 1 satoshi private
Will be worth thousands as you know, your welcome!
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:37:17
No, miners are just random number generators, completely worthless outside of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-29 07:25:38
Exactly, the only way money should be created is by Chinese ASIC mining farms. (or basement gpu mining rigs)

Yes I troll so what? I've owned bitcoins since 2011.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:53:37
My bank offers free transfers to any bank for free, 5000 daily limit. Sounds like you need to find a better bank/CU.

I'm not a troll anymore, I read Satoshi's white paper, praise be upon him, and learned to love the one true currency.

Then switch banks, why would you ever use a bank that doesn't offer free transfers.

Why would I pay taxes? If they want my bitcoin they're going to have break into my cold storage.

For anyone doubting I bought 25 thousand in bitcoin, here you go:
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:52:00
Someone said the same thing to me in late 2013, when the price crashed.
That account has been shadowbanned, but the reply was something like this, "lol buttcoiner mad he missed the boat, this correction will end soon and we'll be back at 1200 in a few weeks"!
Tell me again why butts are now anything but a pump and dump? At least back in 2010 it had people who believed in it, now its just daytraders  and bagholders.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:19:34
I posted proof of my how much bitcoin I hold, what else do you need? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:37:08
Sort of, but I'd have to take out more loans, although they would be private instead of federal. Do you think bitcoin will be higher than ~265 in 2 years or so?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:05:45
I get paid in bitcoin, and I'll just buy gift cards to amazon and use prime pantry. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:26:45
I agree, put all your money in bitcoin right now, price is about to reach 1k+
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:04:34
Well then what is the point of using butts, it's too bad Nymeria dies in Arya's new chapter, Mercy.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:56:01
That's certainly part of it, but Aegon is confirmed a Blackfyre in the new World of Ice and Fire.

I have a few people that buy bitcoin from me, I'll just have them pay my bills in their worthless fiat, and I'll trade them some bitcoin.
Simple free market solutions, no need for government currency.

I don't want to belong to the old system, I want to belong to the future. 
Imagine if the guy who bought the pizzas with bitcoin in 2010 hadn't done so, we wouldn't be here.

The second winner was affected, her bitcoin donations lost half their value before she could figure out how to sell them for $. 
Lets hope that it doesn't happen to this new winner.

When I need to send money to a family member, I just transfer it from my bank account to theirs. Free and instant. My money is safe from being goxxed, and I don't need to worry about shady startup exchanges like Circle.
Tell me again why you need to involve butts at all?
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:43:56
The same reason everyone else, because Jon dies at the end of book 5.
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:48:43


implying this is even real
So your family has ways to cash out butts to real money for free? Or are they going to keep it in butts?
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:15:44
They're subsidized federal loans. In 3 years when bitcoin is at $10k per coin I will pay it all back in one payment.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:52:57
@_date: 2015-07-09 04:53:28
I asked google if they wanted bitcoin and they said no. I told them they should expect to lose at least 3 angry customers who want to give them money.
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:29:51
So what if its spam? It's good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:03:57
If you didn't sell any bitcoin then you don't have any capital losses. You don't have anything to report.
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:38:50
It's a win win for everyone involved.
Valve saves money. (CC fees)
Bitcoin gets exposed to millions of gamers.
Mod developers don't have to be exposed to chargebacks.
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:06:27
Well their bitcoin sales dropped to nearly zero, this announcement sounds like damage control to me.
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:24:06
Steam is the best platform available. All these "alt sites" are just shit copies of steam that might as well be scams.
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:24:47
These buttcoin trolls need to fuck off. Bitcoin is stronger than ever, especially with our dedicated community!
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:59:23
Paid mods are the future of indie development. You're just like one of those bankster shills that fight against bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:57:16
You're a paycoin shill, paid by Josh Garza to troll this community. I wont be responding to these blasphemous accusations.

The bitcoin revolution can be stoppped by them, we have to fight back against the bank shills
We would be at 100000 a coin if buttcoin were banned

You need to read the wiki brother, I had the same doubts but satoshi showed me the light, embrace it!
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:30:24
when buttcoin brigades this sub its not free speech buddy
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:29:16
Don't you understand? they are hurting our investment, how will we ever reach 10k so we can cash out? My feelings aren't hurt, just my wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:29:57
no but they should be removing posts that are brigaded by buttcoin
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:08:06
They stalk the new section like I said, go into any new post and you'll see the positive posts like mine are downvoted, while negative posts go to the top
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:58:08


Thats because buttcoin is brigading it


They stalk the new section every day, go asks their mods and they'll confirm, they are paid by paycoin and butterfly labs
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:19:41


It's been deleted by now, but it was a pencil drawing of satoshi. They made fun of it and mocked me.

wow why didn't they tell me that before, fucking assholes, they told me to buy some bitcoin in case newegg does a bitcoin deal again, since it takes a while to get verified on circle

@_date: 2015-03-09 03:49:03


they linked to the posts and asked everyone to "vote it to the top"


Brigading is against this sites rules, free speech isn't even a relevant thing to consider, and in the future where bitcoin reigns supreme, breaking a companies rules will be punishable by death.
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:22:54
The idea of a decentralized currency not controlled by tyrants is absurd to the majority of the world, but here we are.

So I have the same amount of bitcoin but its worth less? Why would that person tell me its great for buying things online when this happens?

why are you defending them, satoshi wouldn't want this and neither do I

I can tell you're new to butts since you don't know all the dank memes yet.

The guy on r/millionairemakers told me it was great for online purchases, so it turns out it actually isn't?

Gotta make up for those losses right?

That satoshi will be worth 1 trillion "2015 dollars".

More like, "bitcoin doesn't offer enough advantages to replace anything".
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:19:45
Yes but there are a lot of ways to transfer money/value online, bitcoin wasn't the first.
