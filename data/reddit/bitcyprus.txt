Advocates of short selling argue that the practice is an essential part of the price discovery mechanism.[43] Financial researchers at Duke University said in a study that short interest is an indicator of poor future stock performance (the self-fulfilling aspect) and that short sellers exploit market mistakes about firms' fundamentals.[44]
Such noted investors as Seth Klarman and Warren Buffett have said that short sellers help the market. Klarman argued that short sellers are a useful counterweight to the widespread bullishness on Wall Street,[45] while Buffett believes that short sellers are useful in uncovering fraudulent accounting and other problems at companies.[46]
Shortseller James Chanos received widespread publicity when he was an early critic of the accounting practices of Enron.[47] Chanos responds to critics of short-selling by pointing to the critical role they played in identifying problems at Enron, Boston Market and other "financial disasters" over the years.[48] In 2011, research oriented short sellers were widely acknowledged for exposing the China stock frauds.[49]
Commentator Jim Cramer has expressed concern about short selling and started a petition calling for the reintroduction of the uptick rule.[50] Books like Don't Blame the Shorts by Robert Sloan and Fubarnomics by Robert E. Wright suggest Cramer exaggerated the costs of short selling and underestimated the benefits, which may include the ex ante identification of asset bubbles.
Individual short sellers have been subject to criticism and even litigation. Manuel P. Asensio, for example, engaged in a lengthy legal battle with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Hemispherx Biopharma.[51]
Several studies of the effectiveness of short selling bans indicate that short selling bans do not contribute to more moderate market dynamics.

This is by far the most exciting security I have invested in. It's hard to believe that shares are still being traded for the IPVO price of 0.003 btc. Let's see how long that lasts! 
[–]BitCyprus 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago
The price on Havelock was stuck at 0.003 BTC in view of the fact that the IPVO (that ends today) was at 0.003 BTC too.
As from today the price at Havelock has started moving above the IPVO price (current price 0.00319).
I believe once the IPVO ends, the price on Havelock will be free from any weights and will start moving up.
Will see.
Once the IPVO closed today at 0.003 BTC the price jumped close to 0.005, a 67% return in a day.
You need not be a genius to have predicted that!

It is logical for the stock not to move given that investors can buy shares directly from the company at 0.003 via the IPVO that ends tonight 12.00 USA time.
Why would anybody buy above 0.003? 
It is only today that the stock has started doing transactions &gt;0.003 BTC (up to 8% above the IPVO price).
Once the IPVO closes, and provided the news coming out are positive, it has the potential to shoot through the roof.

"What is causing this"?
Answer: THIS! (read below)
Revenue &amp; Customs Brief 09/14
 
Tax treatment of activities involving Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies
Purpose of this Brief
This brief sets out HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) position on the tax treatment of income received from, and charges made in connection with, activities involving Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies, specifically for Value Added Tax (VAT), Corporation Tax (CT), Income Tax (IT) and Capital Gains Tax (CGT). 
Anyone making charges or otherwise receiving income, in whatever form, from activities involving Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies), including:
• Bitcoin miners
• Bitcoin traders
• Bitcoin exchanges
• Bitcoin payment processers
• Other Bitcoin service providers
Bitcoin is seen as the world's first decentralised digital currency, otherwise known as a 'cryptocurrency'. The advent of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is a new and evolving area and determining their legal and regulatory status is ongoing. Cryptocurrencies have a unique identity and cannot therefore be directly compared to any other form of investment activity or payment mechanism. 
 HMRC understands that Bitcoin operates via a peer to peer network, independent of any central authority or bank. All functions such as issue, transaction processing and verification are managed collectively by this network. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a shared public database called a 'block-chain'. New Bitcoin is produced when a new block is attached to the chain. A new block can only be added to the chain when the answer to a complex cryptographic algorithm is solved. Participants in this activity are known as ‘miners’.
As well as mining, activities include the buying and selling of Bitcoin and providing exchange facilities for parties to trade Bitcoin with recognised currencies. Bitcoin may be held as an investment or used to pay for goods or services at merchants where it is accepted. In the UK, there are already a number of outlets, including pubs, restaurants and internet retailers, that accept payment by Bitcoin.
VAT treatment of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies
As an EU tax, the VAT treatment for cryptocurrencies adopted by the UK must be consistent with any treatment that may eventually be implemented across the EU. 
 Given this, the evolutionary nature of these cryptocurrencies and the legal and regulatory environments in which they currently operate, this brief outlines HMRC’s provisional VAT treatment pending further developments; in particular, in respect of the regulatory and EU VAT position. Taxpayers can rely on the VAT treatment outlined below unless and until HMRC announces any changes. Any changes will not apply retrospectively.
For VAT purposes Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies will be treated as follows below, this in no way reflects on how they are treated for regulatory or other purposes:
•1.Income received from Bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT on the basis that the activity does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes because there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received.
• 2.Income received by miners for other activities, such as for the provision of services in connection with the verification of specific transactions for which specific charges are made, will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) of the EU VAT Directive as falling within the definition of 'transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments.'
• 3. When Bitcoin is exchanged for Sterling or for foreign currencies, such as Euros or Dollars, no VAT will be due on the value of the Bitcoins themselves.
• 4. Charges (in whatever form) made over and above the value of the Bitcoin for arranging or carrying out any transactions in Bitcoin will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) as outlined at 2 above. 
However, in all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency. The value of the supply of goods or services on which VAT is due will be the sterling value of the cryptocurrency at the point the transaction takes place
Corporation Tax, Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax treatment of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies 
As with any other activity, whether the treatment of income received from, and charges made in connection with, activities involving Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies will be subject to Corporation Tax, Income Tax or Capital Gains Tax depends on the activities and the parties involved.
 Whether any profit or gain is chargeable or any loss is allowable will be looked at on a case-by-case basis taking into account the specific facts. Each case will be considered on the basis of its own individual facts and circumstances. The relevant legislation and case law will be applied to determine the correct tax treatment. Therefore, depending on the facts, a transaction may be so highly speculative that it is not taxable or any losses relievable.. For example gambling or betting wins are not taxable and gambling losses cannot be offset against other taxable profits. 
For businesses which accept payment for goods or services in Bitcoin there is no change to when revenue is recognised or how taxable profits are calculated. 
• Corporation Tax: The profits or losses on exchange movements between currencies are taxable. For the tax treatment of virtual currencies, the general rules on foreign exchange and loan relationships apply. We have not at this stage identified any need to consider bespoke rules. 
 For companies, exchange movements are determined between the company’s functional currency (usually the currency in which the accounts are prepared) and the other currency in question. If there is an exchange rate between Bitcoin and the functional currency then this analysis applies. Therefore no special tax rules for Bitcoin transactions are required. The profits and losses of a company entering into transactions involving Bitcoin would be reflected in accounts and taxable under normal Corporation Tax rules.
• Income Tax: The profits and losses of a non-incorporated business on Bitcoin transactions must be reflected in their accounts and will be taxable on normal income tax rules.
• Chargeable gains - Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax: If a profit or loss on a currency contract is not within trading profits or otherwise within the loan relationship rules, it would normally be taxable as a chargeable gain or allowable as a loss for Corporation Tax or Capital Gains Tax purposes. Gains and losses incurred on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are chargeable or allowable for Capital Gains Tax if they accrue to an individual or, for Corporation Tax on chargeable gains if they accrue to a company.
Future implications
The tax treatments outlined in this brief are for tax purposes only. They in no way reflect on the treatment of cryptocurrencies for regulatory or other purposes.
 Given the evolutionary nature of these cryptocurrencies, HMRC will issue further guidance as appropriate

The success of bitcoin is inversely related to its price. That is 100% true, unless people start using it as an investment/store of value. 
Until now, those who have attempted to use it as a store of value have been slaughtered by the market price.

THE MARKETS BET THAT BITCOIN PRICE IS GOINF TO FALL
Read this: 
Swaps activity spikes
A look at the swaps activity on Bitfinex reveals more bearish indicators. The sum of active BTC swaps began to rise sharply on 25th October suggesting that traders are betting that the bitcoin price will fall further.
A BTC swap takes place when traders borrow bitcoin at one price to trade it for US dollars, hoping the price will fall by the time they purchase bitcoin again to return it to the lender. Total BTC swaps on Bitfinex nearly doubled from 8,799 BTC on 25th October to 16,281 BTC the next day.
Examining the swap data in greater detail also suggests that shorts profited from the mid-week price drop. Bitcoin swaps spiked as the price tumbled on the morning of 23rd October, potentially driving the price down.
As the week ended, total active swaps stood at over 18,000 BTC, the highest level since April 2013, according to Bitfinex data. Swap volume also depends on the amount of customers using a particular exchange, of course, and Bitfinex's trading volume and user base has only become significant since last October, according to Bitcoinity volume data.

Agree 100% with the "Evaporation in bitcoin value" theory.
Bitcoin is the greatest invention of manking since the invention of PCs in the 70s and the internet in the 90s, however its success is inversely related to its value.
As it becomes more successful, accepted and adopted, its price is more likely to fall than to rise.

The best thing that happened to Bitcoin is the complete isolation of China from BTC because, until December's crash the world BTC markets have been following the BTC China price.
Thanks to the world's biggest dictatorship, the bloody chinese markets are simply non-relevant any more.

Most probably BTC will be treated as in Germany, as a financial instrument and CGT will be 0%.

Traditionally the big panics happen on Sundays when the banks are closed and people cannot transfer cash to the trading accounts.
I believe later today and tomorrow the market will test new lows.

Some people never learn.
You have been warned.
The price will settle around $10.

I was in a bar a couple of weeks ago (before it was unveiled that Neo had to do with Bitcoin) watching a football game when suddenly the first ads starting popping up with the Bitcoin logo and the Neo logo. Everybody was wondering what that B logo was, literally no one new!
A couple of weeks later, the whole country is talking about Bitcoin! 
Well done guys :)

Very proud to attend this.
University Of Nicosia: University Of Bitcoin
A Wall Street Journal article from around the time of the University of Nicosia’s first announcement of their Digital Currency Initiative referred to the University, as the “University of Bitcoin.”  Shortly after the University revealed their commitment to Digital Currencies in 2013, African student Francois Rossouw became the first student in history to pay tuition using Bitcoin.  Of course, the University also accepts Bitcoin payments for their MSc in Digital Currency program and has also received their first Bitcoin tuition payment towards the MSc programme.  Digital Currency used to pay for a degree about Digital Currency… Sure seems like the start of a complete economy to me!
Stay tuned to CCN for the latest about the University of Nicosia’s MSc in Digital Currency!

You have been celebrating that you have killed the bearwhale at $300.
How do you feel that effectively he has cashed in at your expense?
The price of bitcoin is inversely related to its success.
Keep it in your portfolio until it goes to $10. That is its true value as an investment.

You are getting yourself slaughtered. Are you blind?
The price goes slowly and steadily to its fair value.
A couple of dollars.
