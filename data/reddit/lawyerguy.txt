Instant buys are back! My friend just got one. Beware though that your first purchase is the ONLY purchase you will be able to make.

My history has not changed, and I cancelled my auto-buy as I received this email: 
I guess the first purchase needs to be verified first before you can set up a recurring. Sucks.

I already have instant verification. I bought one last night @ 550 and it's pending. I don't see the recurring buy in my history. It just says active on the recurring page.

Sounds like your account has been compromised. Check ALL of your security, change passwords, etc. Someone has your password.

BUY! TO THE MOTHER FUCKING MOOOOOOON!

I'm curious too.

Welcome. TO THE MOON!!!
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:24:35
No. It was a gift.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:58:43
omg awesome good luck to us all!

You should probably transfer everything to a new wallet, truecrypt it, run virus scans, check IP logs on emails, etc. Maybe someone you know keylogged you? Cover all of your bases.

TO THE MOON! BUY NOW!
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:41:58
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:47:25
Have you made a successful purchase before?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:15:37
Ah well that explains it. Wish I bought in sooner lol
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:15:01
I did that and it has not locked in a price. How will I know that it's been finalized?

I am experiencing exactly what packpride is. No payment value, no price, no guarantee, no transaction history.
