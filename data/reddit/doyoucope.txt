Yes the US government has lots of money, but that does not imply it can "frivolously" spend, or do anything effectively or efficiently with said money. 
An easy example I know of is Wall Street. We have the SEC and investment banks in an information arms race. The best and brightest are not in the SEC, they are in the investment banks. For one reason: investment banks pay a lot more.

Except it has. Apple marketshare dropping = more people choosing to use Android instead of Apple.

You have a lot left to learn about reading comprehension. 
Point of parent post: as people move from iOS to Android, their stock prices will drop. 
Then people conflate monetary (stock/capital, call it whatever you want) marketshare with unit market share. As you have done as well. Apple has plenty of other products that keep its monetary marketshare large. 
However, it's unit marketshare in the mobile market that this thread is talking about; which makes sense because the OP is on an app being removed. 
I made no comment on Apple market cap or how people switching to Android affects that. 
My direct response is that yes, in fact, over the past several quarters, Android has killed iOS in terms of sales. 
I was pointing out the irrelevancy of "apple iPhone sales have increased" as a counter argument to the fact that Apple unit marketshare is shrinking.

I'm not sure I understand. The difficulty is determined at the protocol level and automatically adjusts every 2016 blocks. 
My point was that if you have 51%--and say you don't get a block-- you can go back, start that block over, and because you have 51%, you will shortly outpace the "real" blockchain and then that block you didn't originally get, you will now have (and now you are once again the legitimate blockchain). You don't need to delay the propagation of blocks to get them, though maybe in practice that makes it easier.

I know I'm a bit late here, but your step 1 says "Send 0.0101337 BTC to your favorite Bitcoin organization."
Yet every txid I've looked at, everyone is donating .001 BTC to YOU (at an address that I don't see anymore), and you've given them VPS's, am I missing something?
I see your edit3, but maybe I'm not understanding...
Lastly, are there any VPS available still? If so, I'll explain the project I've been working on :)

Wow, really fast response, and I just saw your updated OP, awesome.

What I want to see eventually is far more bitcoin infrastructure and access (exchanges, ATMs, vendors) here in the US. 
That's a pretty lofty goal for someone who's still in college, so I've started out smaller.  Currently a friend and I are working on making a trading platform (a testbed, basically) for sending/receiving a large volume of transactions and data. The ultimate goal would be to actually create an exchange; but at the very least, it's a proof of concept that could be used for another service.
A VPS with multiple IPs would do wonders for development, specifically for remote testing.

Thank you very much! This is so great :)!

It's simple, one is /monetary/ inflation and one is /price/ inflation. Two /different/ concepts, /each/ with their /own/ definition. But when the the average person says "inflation" they mean price inflation; I should have been clearer. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 04:43:44
There really aren't two definitions for each. It's prices. 
Increasing (or decreasing) the money supply is not inherently inflationary (or deflationary).

Length means nothing, it's the fork with more cumulative hashing power that gets accepted. That's the idea behind proof of work.
So if they have 51%, they can always get the block, regardless of network delay.

Well I completely agree with your example; and it's a good one given your context. 
I don't think anyone literally believes that we can somehow divine whether customers are switching or not from sale data. 
What matters is the growth and aggregate sales. So the fact that Apple's marketshare is going down is very telling, regardless of the actual reason. In addition, not only is their marketshare dropping, more Android devices are sold than iOS. So you'd have to switch the iOS and Android sale numbers, the 5 and 4 Million. 
One of the first links I saw was: 
Ultimately I'm not sure why people are up voting erroneous information and down voting correct information, though.

@_date: 2014-03-08 22:33:17
Haha yeah I'm not sure what's up with down voting correct information. The truth is both Apple's marketshare and number of devices shipped per quarter are losing to Android, that's the numbers and not my opinion. 
But I've had an iPhone for a long time; I recently discovered the nexus line--it's wonderful. And I'm glad people are finally choosing platforms for what they can do for you as the user, and not just via fiat by name. That's how it should be. 
Ultimately I think that's why Android is taking over; there are so many more possibilities compared to iOS.

That isn't just anti bank, it's being an ahole. 
There's probably nothing wrong "with being anti bank to the newbs" /as long as they don't act stupidly condescending/
