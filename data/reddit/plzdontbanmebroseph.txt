When counterfeit money is being used to prop up the price of something, artificially pump demand and reduce supply.. then the rug is pulled out from under the market, evaporating billions of fake USD from the market.. YEAH.. its gonna crash.  Cryptocurrency is overpriced by 90%+

Who is this "we" you're talking about?  you think EVERYONE gives a  FUCK about this SHIT because you do?  Get a CLUE brother, 99% of the people here dont care about technology or politics.  They want a lambo.  If Bitcoin doesn't give them a quick lambo, they ride off in their pinto with a middle finger fully extended in YOUR direction BITCH.

You're a cult member, not an investor.  You are a ponzi scheme spreading get rich quicker.  The people you are CONvincing to buy bitcoin will lose a lot of money and hate you for it.  Keep that in mind please.

I would recommend selling the BTC for cash and going to your local coin shop.  There are websites out there but then you gotta worry about it being shipped to you and such, not worth the risk IMO.

It depends on how much money the hodler trolls have to make a put stick.  Most of these people here see BitCoin as a religion and their ticket out of having to do actual work.  So they'll throw as much good money after bad trying to stabilize the price as long as they can.  The main goal of this sub is a long term pump and dump operation, the people here just don't realize it yet.  But they want to pump pump pump and hate on anyone who takes profit...  It's the stupidest investment strategy I've ever seen...  If you bought at 3000$ and don't sell at 5000$, you're a fool who just missed out on making money.  Just to not disappoint some random guys on reddit you'll never meet.   BitCoin is not the currency of the future.... It's not going to 100,000$ per coin...  Just pump and dump it frequently if that's what makes you happy but realize that one day it will be worth nothing and some other, probably ECB backed Crypto will be standardized leaving bitcoin some obscure currency used only for illegal activities...  
TLDR: Get out while you can.

I love how people are so arrogant.. they really think making a post on reddit is going to change the market lol  yes, we all know by now there was some bad reporting in the media.. get over it.

Yo... This BitCoin hype is a circle jerk ponzi scheme...  All you guys do is beg "hodl! hodl!"... because you know that you're only here for a get rich quick scheme...  you can only make money if other people buy into the hype of also getting rich quick.  That's the very definition of a pyramid scheme....  The conmen who talked YOU into buying at 4,000+ $ per coin sold at 4,500 $ and now you lost 1000$ ... the only way you can regain your losses is by CONNING other people into wasting their money so you can sell at breaking even.  Wake up, fool.  You were conned.

The price will stabilize today... then drop HARD.  It's called a Bull Trap. When the price goes back up a bit, some nervous speculators who were too late to sell for a high price will feel better about selling. Then it will fall FAST AND HARD.  Watch, by next week this thing will be at 2,400$ if you're lucky.  Bitcoin is worth zero.  Totally worthless.  Theres 1000 other crypo currencies out there and many with better technology.  More and more governments will ban the use of bitcoin and introduce their own cryptocurrencies to compete.. you think fiat currency is bad because of inflation??? Just wait until the number of cryptos goes to the moon and back.  Tell your parents you got conned into a ponzi scheme and that they should buy physical gold &amp; silver with their bitcoins.
