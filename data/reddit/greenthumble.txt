Thanks. This has been sitting open in a tab in my browser a while. Read it yesterday and was thinking about this.
My app needs to do some secure comms with the server. It's a convenient way to verify identity, I'm not trying to hide stuff from the users. My solution uses a privately generated key, so no CAs are involved or anything like that.
If the user needs to inspect network traffic it can be done by identifying the high level networking functions in the app that do TLS and dumping the requests and responses to a file. If the app is open source then I fail to see any issue with using it.

Yeah the screenshot looked like BofA's site to me also. They may refund those fees just talk to them. I've had it go both ways. One time they just flat out refused to refund any fees. Other times they have waived some or even all of the fees. One time their ATM dispensed an incorrect amount of bills (it looked like I was supposed to get 2 50's and a twenty because after asking for $120 the machine gave me 3 twenties) and they actually refunded this in full.
I bet if you're persistent you'll get at least half of it back if not all. Does suck to deal with though.

Heh well I'm not one to take buzzwords and run with them. But this does seem a bit perceptibly different. During the tech boom I knew we were in a tech boom because I was in it. During the housing boom I knew we were in a housing boom because of a huge surge of home improvement TV shows and my brother in law participating. This time it's more elusive. No obvious cause, at least not that I'm seeing. Maybe it's multiple bubbles.
Edit: thought about this later. Here's a good way to describe what I'm seeing. In those first two bubbles, tons of people were talking about things they had no idea about and normally wouldn't be discussing. My mom talking about Peapod for example. Or as mentioned my brother in law talking about flipping houses. When there's a big money pile lots of people blabber about how they're getting part of it. This time I'm missing that chatter. Is anyone hearing friends/relatives talking about new investment schemes of some kind? Are people investing in student loans as per 's suggestion?

Exactly. I've seen big new rigs getting tested on testnet and the blocks started flying. One day that I remember blocks were being found at a rate of every few seconds. Someone with a huge rig running the newer version and doing it temporarily (since obviously they move to real net after testing) could easily cause this situation.

Also heh I don't care what you think. Those coins are not going to be "killed" by any Bitcoin feature, suggesting so is pretty laughable.
Edit: I should probably clarify why it is laughable to me. The target of sidechains is the altcoin developers right? The idea being to give people a place to innovate on Bitcoin itself without messing with the core chain, correct? Well, I AM an altcoin developer with 2 coins under my belt. And I'll tell you right now that sidechains are just not interesting to me. And I don't see my fellow devs in the altcoin community doing excited jumping-jacks over it. The whole idea just seems to solve a non-existent problem, a perceived "slight" against Bitcoin by the alts. I'm fairly sure this idea was doomed before it started.

A hash is a one way type deal. You put some data into the hashing algorithm and a really huge and hopefully unique number pops out. One way means if you have this number you can't go back and get the original content from it.
Deciding on some features this huge number has makes a nice little puzzle for a computer to solve. Namely, the resulting number must be below a certain given threshold called "difficulty". The larger the difficulty the fewer solutions exist to the puzzle.
Because of the one-way feature, you can't just take any old random number that satisfies this difficulty and then work backwards and get the inputs that supposedly "created" it. You *absolutely must* start with the inputs that connect this puzzle to the entire history of Bitcoin, run the algo, and see if the results satisfies this puzzle. This is what is meant by "work" when someone says "Proof of Work".
 The "proof" part is when you say "here's the inputs that connect this block i made to the rest of Bitcoin's history, and when you hash it the result that satisfies the puzzle criteria".
If you proved you solved the puzzle using the hashing algorithm, ding ding ding congrats you just won yourself 25 shiny Bitcoins.
The kicker is that the puzzle is *hard*. Difficulty is adjusted when people add hardware to the network so that the blocks are found at a consistent rate of time. And nowadays people are throwing massive computational power at solving the puzzle, so unless you have mass amounts of computing power Bitcoin is a non-starter. However, you can mine and find blocks on some of the smaller alt coins. They of course won't be worth nearly as much as Bitcoin is!
Edit: oh and of course I forgot to mention what all this is acutally for ;-) The inputs to these puzzles you solve contain people's transactions. This is what is meant by "confirmations". When your transaction is first confirmed, that means it got included into one of these puzzle blocks. Further confirmations mean other people on the peer to peer network agree that it solves the puzzle.

Thanks for posting those. Exciting things in this release. "estimatefee" RPC function looks handy. One of the first things I tried to do as a new Bitcoin user last year was to write an RPC fee function, glad it's officially there now.
The "watch-only addresses" are really neat. I don't know if this can be combined with blockchain pruning, but if it can it presents a neat new lightweight option for servers: I run the full Bitcoin client at home or somewhere handy with lots of cheap disk/cpu/network. Periodically it delivers some new pubkey addresses to the lightweight server and the private keys stay off the public webserver and behind several firewalls.
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:26:27
The tx fee is 0.0001 right? And sometimes bigger when the tx is complex. If bits are the default, transaction fees would start at 100. I think bits is dividing it too far.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:52:59
Huh well I guess I can't play then. The thing I am loving about MintPal and Bittrex is that the minimum trade is ridiculously low, 0.0001 BTC. So a poor fellow like me with $0.5 worth of BTC can play around for some fun, see what it's like doing trading. I have enjoyed it and made a few pennies here, lost a few pennies there. If I ever have a substantial amount of money to trade with I'll probably avoid Bitstamp you guys are making it sound pretty shady.

In my experience the quality and intent of the hardware supplier is not a motivating factor for open source developers, either positive or negative. The primary thing that attracts us is pretty much - hardware availability. We like making hardware work for us the way we want it to, it's our raison d'etre.
This also means whoever will take this on will either (1) own one of these machines and do it primarily for themselves but decide to make the results open source or (2) will be paid by someone who owns one of these machines to write open source software (getting paid to do that is not a contradiction) and give them physical access to a machine for as long as needed because unless you have a full emulator stack, writing software for a machine you don't have sitting in front of you is VERY difficult.
So this is not out of the realm of possibility but it will take one or two things to happen first. Quickest route to a successful solution is if a developer sees this post who happens to own one and gets pissed about the new proprietary version.

As a 20 year web dev veteran let me tell you right now nothing is ever that easy. A responsible developer would *never* do what you suggested on a live website. There will be a vetting and testing process and possibly a full review of the code in question, depending on how big client security concerns are. All parties must agree that (a) everything is working and (b) everything looks okay and (c) the end result is a secure website. 
All in all your "ten minute change" is more like at least several hours of time at minimum.
Attitudes like yours make professional web development difficult. You are setting up unrealistic expectations.

Some of them have interesting features that Bitcoin does not.
They can be traded for Bitcoin on exchanges including mintpal.com, cryptsy.com, bittrex.com, poloniex.com. These exchanges are mini stock markets with highly volatile values. You can try your hand at some trading if you want.
Dogecoin has the interesting feature that the transaction fee is very low (1/100 BTC transaction fees if I remember right) and so people love it for tipping small amounts. Dogecoins are common and easy to get ahold of and the community there is great (though they are a bit Nascar crazy at the moment!) Hang out with that crowd and you'll make some nice tip money only for participating.
Some newer coins also have interesting features, in particular a feature called "proof of stake". This is something like bank interest that rewards you for running a wallet and keeping your money in there for longer periods of time. In theory your Bitcoins can be working for you if you trade for one of these coins, hold it, trade back after getting some interest. Be careful with this and do your research before spending a lot of money.
Altcoins are fun. There is a massive and growing community that hangs around irc.freenode.net - in particular start with  and

Donno why you got downvoted. I turned nothing but tips and small bits of script writing programming work for hire into something significant a few times now through trading. Cashed out about $400 worth so far. Zero investment, just from being involved with some altcoin communities and doing things that seemed interesting. Gather for a while, get it on an exchange, and do some careful trading. It is possible. Just take it slow. Never buy because you want to buy, only buy when you have an exit plan in place. Don't buy and sell at market price, put your orders as high or as low as you think it will go and above all have patience. If something dives that you expected to go up, hold it, it's just about never worth dumping something at a low price. Every single time I've been burned the price recovered some time afterwards.

I was having a guess as I read parent post. Here's an idea: if you suspect your pool is being attacked this way, send the same work to multiple users. You reduce your effective pool hash rate while you're looking because that "bait" work is doubled up. But as soon as one miner finds a full proof of work but the other one does not you've got your culprit. Not a super efficient way to do it I'll grant you but it seems like it would find the evildoer. Major problem though is that once discovered someone perpetuating this attack could easily just get another account (even with Facebook login, I don't think that's going to stop a determined attacker).

Well heh that's functionally equivalent to Gavin's approach, at least for the next few years while we observe growth and see if it's working OK, I'd be fine with that. The ones without a solution are just begging for a fee war based on 1MB blocks though and that makes me suspicious that they have plans for fighting this war.

How do you screw up a transaction exactly in such a way that it would need to be "undone" ? My client doesn't let me send to an invalid address. Surely you copy and paste addresses and amounts and double check them?
When you purchase something online do you often go "Oh wait that's wrong" and want to undo it? If so I think you may be damaged.

Yeah I don't know what to do. The funds are lost too of course. Fortunately it was only 0.01 to 0.02 (I forget) but still. More worrying though was when I contacted them and they said "eh it's new try another method of payment". I mean, technically everything's there, or should be. My account, my payment request, the transaction. But my account can't pay with Bitcoin any more and I got no games for my donation. I should try again maybe it's been reset or something since then, tried it when they first started accepting it.

This article is terrible.
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:32:05
Yeah probable they will have a different # of coins and one of the forks will have to be entirely ditched. It may well get resolved by itself because one chain is longer, and the network gets itself back together in a connected state, and then one chain ditched based on the length (amount of work in the chain). Anyhoo 100 blocks is just a way to more say "it would take a shit-ton of work to have a chain separate from this one with this many blocks and therefore it is unlikely that one exists."
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:05:13
Actually and forgot to mention, of course regular transactions in the blocks of a failed fork (not miner's reward / coinbase tx's) just get put back into the memory pool for inclusion again in the real chain. That can actually cause # of confirmations of a tx to temporarily go back down.
The coinbase however, it represents the work that we're going to throw away. This whole thing is just about not letting people spend that reward before we're positive we have a coherent chain.
I think it can and has gotten ugly when miners lose their rewards. Things get super interesting and very chaotic when we do go over that 100 threshold. Suddenly those blocks can be spent and when we're destroying the failed chain vendors who thought they received coin from a customer could get it yanked away.

Wrong. The Bitcoins that go into a place like Cryptsy or Bittrex are not the ones that come back out after you do some trading. Off chain transactions. On top of that, someone could easily trade for an alt with privacy features, use that to mix it up, send it back to another altcoin exchange and withdraw BTC from there. The blockchain does not make all money traceable...

Huh I would say equally it's not exactly the perfect Libertarian monetary system as well to be fair here. Governments gonna take taxes from you, period. It's a ~~social~~ (edit: better word) societal contract that Bitcoin doesn't break. It's normally voluntary anyway, government doesn't come janking your bank account unless they have to. So it just remains voluntary. And the governments will find some other way to punish / obtain the keys of people trying to hide money.

I mean you voluntarily pay. Don't be a pedantic dink, there's too much of that around here. Edit: oh yeah. You are also free to move to a different country which has a tax structure you like.

Yeah not just individual coins, OP could have pointed it at a mining rental service and then not even run the thing until someone wants to rent it at OP's specified rate and collected BTC directly. Someone will want to mine SHA256 alts even if nobody in this thread or OP does. Win/win.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:58:27
Eh all that means is that this coin was recently generated as a block reward. We wait like 100 (is it? I'm typing this before coffee) blocks before you can spend coin that was mined. Makes sense to wait at least a little while to ensure the block is actually on the right chain fork before it can be spent. 100 might be a bit excessive.
@_date: 2015-05-08 00:57:59
Well then enlighten us. What stops the memory pool overflowing and causing one of the three very well known scenarios in that list from happening to many nodes at once and bringing the system to a grinding halt? Point to code in Bitcoin core please.

Yeah this is the root of your misunderstanding. Yes, this is true for you. And me. And some dude in China. So let's say now that China disconnects itself from the rest of the internet. Miners there will be making a valid chain and the clients behind the great firewall will be all happy with their one chain. Meanwhile, outside, we will be experiencing the same but on our own, different chain. Once we realize what's happening and go to glue them back together, that's where we have trouble.
Edit: oh and censorship isn't the only cause. Bugs can cause it too, or even like an announcement of an upcoming hard fork and a big enough percent of users doesn't upgrade, network can splinter.
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:58:40
If there the chain forks that means there are temporarily two chains. Before it's resolved it could be, because of a bug or because the network is having trouble connecting disparate parts, that several blocks are mined on both chains. When we resolve this back to a single chain we have to ditch one of those forks. Any blocks mined on the losing fork, those coins don't exist, exactly as if they never were mined to begin with. The buffer of 100 blocks gives us time to fix such a fork before spending happens which makes it worse.
Edit: missing words.
Oh and edit again: yeah I remember this happening on some altcoins. They called it a "happy chain" because the difficulty on those coins was adjusted very quickly, every block if I remember right. So once disconnected from the rest, certain miners were finding lots of blocks simply because they were separated from the competition.
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:54:46
Eh then stop talking in absolutes if you don't want an absolute answer.

News flash: prosecutor does the thing that doesn't tank his case.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:47:14
I think it's because if you have a normal tx that is on a bad fork well we can still trace the lineage of those coins backwards to where they existed before the fork. Newly minted ones have no lineage yet. So it's like a safeguard I guess, no way to spend coins that can evaporate into the ether. But yeah I do think 100 is probably high. It's not really that long though, what like a (edit: half) day? Doesn't seem like a big deal for miners though I could be wrong, never heard one complain about it.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:11:19
Donno why you were downvoted for that perfectly factual statement. Have a dink back up. Yeah they don't all use SHA256 for a mining algo (some use Scrypt, some use X13, some don't mine normally but use "proof of stake"... etc). But the ones that do use SHA256 it would work fine.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:50:22


The order of the transactions matters. The merkle root will change based on how you ordered them as a miner. So if you went through all nonce values and didn't hit, you can shuffle and try again.
Also remember - by the time you have searched all the nonces, there is a very good chance that a bunch more transactions will have appeared in the transaction memory pool.
So, *eventually* a solution will be found pretty much no matter what.
Edit: oh and I believe what you said isn't exactly correct. Difficulty won't decrease mid-block.

At some point [this]( will overflow the available space in 1MB blocks. So we do have to deal with this volume at some point, therefore *something* "needs to be done". Gavin's solution is simple code-wise and I certainly trust his ability to test Bitcoin, don't know about you. Therefore yes, it (or other solution for more tx) needs to be done. And the reason for "sooner the better" of course is that the more clients that are running in the world means more people not updating to the new solution at fork time (the percentage of people who don't upgrade will be similar the raw number will be higher).

By the way the 0.10 branch relaxes what is considered to be a "standard" transaction, so scripts are no longer limited to a few predefined templates.
Could get interesting.
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:38:32
Why the hate for altcoins? Bitcoin is open source right? So what you're saying you advocate is an open source system that should never be forked. I think the alt hating crowd is missing a couple basic things here.
(1) Bitcoin is open source. It's open source. Open source. You understand that term right or should I look it up for you.
(2) Altcoins do not hurt or lower the value of Bitcoin.
(3) People like making them.
(4) Bloat Bitcoin's chain, WHY?! It's already like 30GB right? Sidechains?!
Edit: to me what you guys are saying is similar to "we invented a whole new kind of database technology. but only ONE database ever needs to exist."
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:20:54
That's possibly true. However the alternative (which I mentioned in another post here) is for the network to start overflowing the block size. *There is no facility to deal with this currently*. What will happen is that the memory pool will grow and grow and the transactions will never end up in a block and eventually the memory pool will be larger than pretty much everyone's RAM memory.
I don't understand why this is difficult to understand and literally I've said this three times in the past couple of days.
Everyone not on Gavin's side on this all act like low / zero fee transactions just disappear into the ether. They most certainly do not. If (when) the average block size exceeds 1MB these lower fee transactions will overrun the entire system. Servers running bitcoind will start swapping to disk instead of using memory. At that point the entire network would go down.

Those hits were really interesting. I feel like looking at this whole thing objectively, it's super clear that Ross was getting scammed out of BTC on every one of those. You'd have to be simple to think that you can order murders over the internet and then to accept photos as "proof" is just more stupidity on top. Movies and artists stage convincing deaths all the time, it's pretty easy.
Then again, maybe your brain starts shutting off when enough people tell you you're Che Guevara and you start to believe it. Who knows. I can't say if he was dumb or just insanely wrapped up in his own shit and being cheered on to do so.

Only, your idea breaks zero confirmation transactions. Software and people will start to have to worry if their sent tx went through and engage in the bidding war. This is not currently the case.
Basically, your "simple" solution screws with tons of existing services and will likely cost Bitcoin businesses a lot of money.
Gavin's solution is actually simple. Bump the limit. Then as others here have mentioned, mitigate problems by delaying the deployment.
Edit: other things your "simple" solution needs: RPC changes to notify someone that their TX was purged. UI changes to notify desktop users that the funds came back. What a joke.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:30:29
If the average size per block goes over 1MB then there certainly will be a problem. Then what we have is an ever growing tx memory pool that can never be satisfied. This is not rocket science.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:21:23
That's weird. I would think the opposite. If you stuff more transactions into each block you got more fees coming in every 10 minutes.

The problem I have with this is SSD. Hosting companies are switching almost exclusively to them and the disk space available in hosting packages seems to have actually gone down in the past couple of years.

I think burnte is talking about services like Bitpay that turn BTC into US dollars and deposit it to seller's bank account.
I'm not convinced this would be an "end run" as burnte said though, that type of exchange business is pretty heavily regulated and subject to anti money laundering / "know your customer" laws.
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:56:47
I made something to generate burn addresses a while ago. Needs Python 3.
This produces the address linked in the title of this post :)
You can just change the first part of the address before where the "zzzzz" starts and it will calculate the checksum and replace the end part.

What a complete and utter moron you are being. Guessing at how Bitcoin works.
Well, it doesn't work like that. A transaction that is valid stays in the mempool until it's placed into a block (or some corner cases where it conflicts, or the coinbase is immature).
So it's great that you're taking an interest in how Bitcoin works. But maybe you should learn a bit about the internals before opening your big mouth.
@_date: 2015-01-09 03:09:43

By every measure the chart I linked to is *rising*. Even with your "transaction waves" and other assorted nonsense in your post you are completely ignoring how the very bottoms of the chart, the lowest point of your "waves" are steadily increasing. Thinking this *won't* hit the 1MB block where low and no-fee transactions start getting ignored is just putting your head in the sand.

@_date: 2015-01-12 03:36:37
You do realize that transactions, even zero fee ones, stick around in the memory pool until satisfied right? So if the average block size is &gt; 1MB then this grows without bounds. Filling up everyone's memory because we can't make blocks fast enough.
And you're just fine with waiting and watching this happen? FFS.

Yeah it seems to be quickly becoming something that not-so-clever people say to make themselves sound smarter. Reminds me of pot legalization discussions in California in 2008. Several different people (who were smokers) told me that "this is not the right plan for CA" and "now is not the right time" and when pressed for details not a single one was provided. Fast forward four years and CO and WA pass similar laws without incident. Gah.
People don't want to think or understand minutia. They want to be told what is smart so they can repeat that. It sucks. (Edit: oops too fast itchy trigger finger) And seems to be hugely susceptible to manipulation - all you have to do is find something that sounds smart/clever and fits the narrative you want to pitch. People will repeat that shit like a Mocking Jay.

Heh yeah Gavin's critics seem to be hoping for a magical equilibrium. Or like the magic hand of the market is going to fix this and in the process prove something. Or perhaps they see it as an opportunity to make money, fighting in the fee wars. The best thing that can happen at this point is that those ideas all fail miserably as they are bound to, and we can just do the sane technical solution and get past this.
Edit: oh and just incase anyone just thinks I'm being a mindless Gavin fanboy, that is absolutely not the case. I have a github pull request pending that Gavin basically stopped in it's tracks with a complete misunderstanding of what it was achieving. So I'll agree with him when he's right, not because he's him.
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:59:43
Heh well it doesn't need any real coding to get burn addresses out of it. Just change the last line. The characters in that string (in the pastebin it says "1111111111111111111fzzzzz") must be from the set of chars listed in "digits58".
If you're interested in the details, the burnaddr function is the meat of this. (1) Decode the string using base58. This produces a byte array with the decoded values. (2) Checksum: take everything except the last 4 bytes and sha256(sha256(v)) on it. (3) Take everything except for the last 4 bytes again, and add the new 4 byte checksum at the end (we're at line 38 now). (4) re-encode to base58 and check that the result is a valid address.

Eh just because you see CSV doesn't mean the original is in that format. I could write a SQL query in about 3 seconds to output that relatively legible comma separated format (kinda important really to show what you've got for sale rather than showing raw SQL or spending more time making pretty HTML). Giving proof that you have access to a db requires the records for proof, not some random SQL.

I don't know how "laborious" it is. Watch feeds, scrape sites for links, filter old content, anything that already has a DVD release is not worth looking at. Download anything that gets past that. I bet it could be handled with a fairly modest server farm, especially if Hollywood money were investing.
Edit: also DERP. These guys would have a whitelist of things they're looking for. Because Hollywood production companies would tell them which movies they embedded this weird thing into, or at least they *should*. Then you have a targeted list of things to DL which is much smaller than the set of all torrents that appear daily.

Why bother? My guess is this is what happened: Someone took over through a PHP or shell hack. Found the database connect info in a PHP file or similar. Connected, did `show tables`, found the users table. Dumped it into a file with CSVs. Grabbed the first 1k, threw together an index.html and replaced the front page. Download the CSV file and send it to anyone who pays.
Or it's an inside job, in which case only the first part about the initial hacking changes, the rest is just the minimal work necessary to sell it.

See but that doesn't matter at all. When I said "smart" earlier they were only smart in context - they were the big fish in the small pond of an altcoin IRC channel.
All that matters when making something like this to get the users of the original sub onboard is to do it better. To avoid the shitstorm of everyone criticizing the winner's history (thread OP linked).
@_date: 2015-04-27 05:02:38
Look, one of the fundamental rules of the sub in question that is attempting to be replaced is that only redditors that have been active for the past few months are eligible.
The reason for this is simple: the original idea for the sub came from an post where someone suggested we could make a millionaire if everyone on reddit gave them a dollar.
This is orthogonal to a perfectly fair lottery that is being suggested by OP which is weighted by entries aka "tickets".
And the war of the idiot gambling addicted whales *will* occur in a perfectly fair anonymous system.

Well I just tried a plain old tx, faucet -&gt; qt desktop client and all went fine. One strange thing about it though, sent this about an hour ago and since then it has been confirmed with 1187 (and rising fast) confirmations.
As to your original question, yes you can be "blacklisted" for misbehaving. Your peers keep a score on you and if you drop below a certain threshold they'll drop. But it won't keep you connected and then reject your tx, it will drop you entirely and put you in a timeout box for a while, not letting your peer even connect.
Edit: 22 minutes later and now 2908 confirms. That's 1721 blocks in 20 minutes. Someone is testing out some big new gear. Perhaps the super fast block times of this is throwing off your systems?

I was responding to the OP. Are we in the same thread here?
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:20:31
That's what I mean by a sweep though. My solution was "pure" (if you had looked at the code and what I said about using it this is perfectly clear) - it entirely chooses a winner weighted based on how much coin they put in exactly. So a few small people knock in with their tips, put in a few pennies worth of coin each, all with similar odds. Then 2 minutes before draw, big guy puts in a hundred bucks worth. See how this is ending up? The only cost in my system was a teeny percent fee that I took.
In a small community like the alts on IRC, there's probably only a couple big guys paying attention at all. Therefore the chances become ridiculously skewed towards them. This is not anecdotal I watched it happen a dozen times on different coins (out of probably several hundred lotteries run).
Here on reddit my guess what would happen is that several big guys would do this against eachother and literally they would be the only winners. Any attempt to weight your chances based on your identity will fail.
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:46:18
Eh that's perfectly calculable. Very easy to calculate. The bot showed who's playing and what they were in for, what the jackpot was of course. How hard is it to place a bet where my fee doesn't overrun that.
How am I missing that? Or are you just making a mountain of a molehill?
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:15:09
No, it's not irrelevant in any way. It allowed him to calculate the fee like we said 4 seconds ago.
The lack of competition I mentioned earlier, and the awkwardness (takes at least like 10-20 mins to get cash into the bot) of loading money plus knowing the bets of everyone else...
I mean how is this rocket science to you? You've got some kind of mental block that won't allow you to accept that the circumstances of the small environment allowed these people to thrive.
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:38:11

I have built a lottery bot for altcoins on IRC before. It is not too difficult, I believe the whole thing was a couple hundred lines of Python.
Choosing a winner with a weighted choice like multiple lotto entries is pretty simple 
The one crazy thing that kept happening is that smart players with a lot of coin would wait until the very last minute, watch the total entries and then come in with a riduclous amount of coin and sweep the thing, putting their chances at 90%+. I suspect some kind of limits will be needed on user entries per contest but since it is anonymized then that just means someone needs to do a bit of clever scripting...
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:38:19
A similar thing happened to me at Humble Bundle. I was an idiot and went to the page and made my selections and then to the checkout screen - but my funds weren't together in one place, had a bit on an exchange and a bit in a local wallet. By the time I had combined them the page had timed out and Bitcoin disappeared as a payment option for me. Why the heck would someone accepting Bitcoin make a timeout so low... gah. Make it like 1/4 of a day or something people sheesh!

There is no "ticket price".
The minimum ticket I guess would be one satoshi (or whatever the equiv would be for an alt coin).
The fee is flat and off the top of the jackpot. You'll also notice when I first mentioned this I said they'd come in *at the last minute*.
The first guy who did this said he just told Siri to remind him 2 minutes before jackpot, checked everything out, walked away with a bundle.
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:31:46
The jackpot is the sum of the bets. The only way for them to have gone over in my system is where the fee overruns the other player's bets. Super easy to calculate and why the players bet last minute.
I'm guessing this solution on reddit would not even have fees if it's a replacement for Edit: oh yeah though I guess we'd be talking about multiple whales against eachother here on reddit. Of course all perfectly "fair" to those who paid in, but not in the spirit at all of the sub we're trying to replace here.
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:41:03
I never said it wasn't fair. Look yes this really is simple.
The code I linked does this:
input [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5]
expected output: (index 1) 10% (index 2) 10% (index 3) 10% (index 4) 10% (index 5) 10% (index 6) 50%
Now imagine that except the 5 is a 5 thousand.
It's perfectly, wonderfully fair. That's why I coded it up this way.
It's also like I said, really clever that those guys took advantage the way they did.
on the other hand only allows one entry per reddit user. That's because it's not a pure lottery like I've said about 6 times in this thread.
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:42:41
I think might be missing the point of It's not to make rich people richer you know.
I have no idea what an negative EV bet is. I linked the source code that chose winners using their bets as input weights. They certainly are smart, unless another whale jumped with a similar amount of coin they were virtually guaranteed a win.

Hey I noticed you downvoted me after I offered proof that numbers aren't stored that way. JSON is a reasonable way to represent the number for *transmission* but I seriously hope you are not using floats or doubles in code. Multiply by 10000000 and use an integer type. Seriously, programming languages deal with this way better and it's how professional financial institutes store numbers. I'm telling you this not for internet points, this thread has sailed. I'm telling you this so you don't write some serious disaster waiting to happen.
Edit: you still can't offer any proof to the contrary right? So you just downvote me after I try to be nice and convey to you what the actual current best practice is. Downvotes are all you have here when there is miles of evidence to the contrary. I feel sorry if anyone hires you as a programmer.

Agreed but here's the thing and what I've been hinting at here. A pure blockchain solution *is* a lottery. In order to do this right it's going to take some kind of way to tie this to real Reddit users. The trick is going to be where that process doesn't become this shitstorm that does when vetting.

Someone in my post said it's spam, but to me it just seems like a normal amount of transactions for the 2 hour block. Since then, every block has been filled to capacity with miners trying to clear the backlog. The fee wars people are getting what they want.

@_date: 2015-03-07 07:17:27
There's a couple glib responses here.
Bitcoin, like every open source project, must keep innovating to keep people on board. If that stops, it opens avenues for the other coins. Same thing with any open source project. If a popular project slows or dies because of developer stagnation, someone will step up and fork it. If the fork continues the incremental improvements while the original project stopped producing releases, there is a very good chance the fork will take over entirely. The "network effect" mentioned in other posts here is just momentum. Take that momentum away and there's not much to stand on.
Where we are right now is that Bitcoin is the only true innovator in this space. None of the alts have managed to produce anything with significantly better utility than Bitcoin itself has.
I wouldn't worry too much. Bitcoin has the most contributing developers, and some of the most talented ones. It's making all the real progress in this space. I think it will be painfully clear if dev starts stagnating.
@_date: 2015-03-07 08:46:22

Hmm yeah it's tapered off. I guess I'm not saying this well, that was 3am hehe. By then, mining will not be the same as it is now. The amount of hardware will be relative to the number of transactions and fees since there is no magic huge reward. Didn't really mean to imply that it happens all at once.

Okay so it's a drain on resources... tempered by Capitalism. Fair enough. It's still a drain and that's the nub of the skeptic argument.
Now, looking at the positive side, because I'm getting sick of trying to think like these skeptics, is this: really it's just a transformation of energy. This expense enables some commerce transactions that would not otherwise have happened or be possible. Meaning the energy expended is improving peoples lives, which is the main point right?

Ok fair enough. Sick of everyone here saying it's my argument. I apologize.
Now, here's the problem with your actual argument. If it is a straw man then the entire argument about wastefulness is because I believe what the "bitcoin wasteful" crowd is actually talking about is electricity and the resources and work necessary to producing transactions.
Maybe it is a straw man. But I can see where these people are coming from. I do not put my head in the sand and say "electricty is not a cost of running Bitcoin".
So once again I get down to it: either you think the utility of Bitcoin outweighs this expenditure in resources or you do not. I don't think that can actually change.
There are 2 things I think CAN change for the better:
(1) People embrace and understand the usefulness.
(2) We try to reduce the amount of energy required to build the blockchain.
Number 2 seems a lot harder than 1.
Edit: (3) More transactions per block == less energy per tx. Ties in with  more people using it means more tx. (thanks !)

I just looked at OP's history. It seems the "shills" he's talking about are people trying to convince OP that tipping people (edit: specifically wait staff at restaurants) in BTC when they didn't ask for that (or work in some obv Bitcoin friendly business) is just plain rude. Edit: in case I'm not being clear, OP is a bundle of sticks looking for sympathy after being downvoted to hades.

It's embarrassing as all hell. And just keeps doubling down deep into that thread.
Maybe we need an evangelist's guide to proselytizing Bitcoin. Things not to do:  tipping waitresses BTC.

Haha! You really think that? Wrong. The big mining facilities choose their location by the cost of electricity, they don't just accept what they have. Dogecoin miners excepted.

For the Bitcoin devs and ecosystem developers what you said may be true ;-&gt;
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:56:32
So, ignore completely the practical reality of what's happening now in favor of a utopian vision where electricity never runs out and is not depleting resources. Gotcha.
Edit: I think I have this slightly wrong. What you're actually saying is that it's fine that Bitcoin uses lots of energy because when coal and gas et al run out that we'll have some other solution based on something else. Just because that may be true does not absolve Bitcoin from it's usage of power, or the resources that it's currently using.

Good work, Middle Man. You've earned that coffee. He paid for it with Bitcoin. Soy skinny latte, 0.25 BTC. EVERYTHING IS AWESOME! Little known fact, not shown in the comic Superman died in the fire and Middle Man went on to produce *CSI Miami*.

The miner chooses his electricity provider. That is how I have "refuted your point that waste has to do with the miners". If Bitcoin miners were conscientious about this, they would chose the technologies you mention over the cheap/dirty. Yet they do not. They are motivated by greed of course, else they would not be opening a mining facility.


What? It does not reflect that. It reflects the availability of raw materials more than anything else. Which is the "expense" I've been talking about all along, not really anything to do with the price or efficiency. Sheesh you'd think this is rocket science.

I was watching them flow by on blockchain.info earlier today. It's gotten to the point if you see something interesting go by in that list it's quite a challenge to even click it they go by so fast.

You are using capitalism to obfuscate the fact that there are less resources available here on Earth than there are in a parallel Earth with no Satoshi. Not by much, I think this argument is overblown. There are decent solutions actually.
But still, in the mind of a skeptic, this is wasteful because they don't see any positive usefulness from this expense.
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:34:55
Hmm. I think the wastefulness argument stems from how much work gets done (how many transactions are served, not the value to the miners) vs how much electricity it costs to make that happen. For example, in trust based systems, inserting a transaction takes minimal electricity. A little bit of code runs to verify things and then a database insert, done. Mining however requires a vast amount of electricity per transaction, a long search for a valid block. Having lots of miners exacerbates this by pushing up the difficulty, causing more electricity to be used per transaction. So I don't think it's monetary waste. More like planetary waste.
Edit: I DO NOT agree with this philosophy that it is overly wasteful. Read my reply below. The utility outweighs the wastefulness. Here I am merely trying to understand the wastefulness argument. So if you could stop downvoting that'd be great.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:38:50
Yeah. The range of escrow services that can be built on P2SH addresses is astounding.
I'm just learning about them but I quickly realized that if any old escrow service takes on the bank security role (1) they themselves can't spend the funds and (2) in order for a bank robbing criminal to spend they would additionally need to break into customer's personal or office computers or whatever and steal another key. Heh which from what I read today the NSA might be able to do (but if they wanted to fuck with you they could freeze your normal bank accounts easily anyway). So I may be drinking the kool-aid here, but this actually seems like a much better way to secure funds than a bank is (volatility aside for sake of argument).
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:02:58
Sure of course. I'm not arguing that it's bad or even one of the ones making the wastefulness argument. To us faithful who have embraced the utility of Bitcoin, the electricity expenditure is totally worth it. To an outsider skeptic, it must look like a vast waste of resources.
Edit: case in point, craigyoureajerk below says this:


This is the nub of this. Either (1) you believe in the benefits and utility of Bitcoin strongly enough that the electricity waste is not a large concern vs (2) you don't so it looks like a vast waste of resources.
Edit 2: oh and btw even though you keep mistaking this as me attacking you and everyone else does too and it's suddenly my "plantary waste" um... 


That is NOT AT ALL what I'm saying. It takes resources to produce electricity. Coal. Gasoline. Uranium. These certainly ARE finite resources. I don't know what's up with your free energy argument here. Aren't you ~~Eric Vorhees~~ Erik Voorhees (should have looked it up rather than memory)? I thought you were smarter than that.
