While we're waiting for SpinforCoin.com, go over to [Kingcoin]( for a fun spin-the-wheel game that's provably fair. And you can play for free before you play for real Bitcoin!

Thanks! If it meets with even a little bit of success, I'll optimize it for mobile. The touch idea is good.

Thank you! Nice screenshot. :) Maybe I should limit how much you can go into the negative!

Sorry, sgornick, you are right--there was a small bug that I have since fixed. Thank you for pointing this out.

Ah, good catch, but you can do this only when you're playing without real BTC on the line! But I think I'll change this so that even in "free" mode, you can't bet what you don't have. Otherwise the score in "free" mode is meaningless... Thanks for the tip.

The game is provably fair. I use Bitzino's method to prove that the wheel is created randomly (except for the black slice, which is a fixed size for every game) and to prove that the spins of the wheel are also random. There is simply no way to rig the game.
Yes, the game works exactly the same whether you're playing for real BTC or in "free" mode.
Your feedback is valuable. Thank you. Is there anything I could do (aside from the mathematical proof which shows each game to be fair) to make you feel better about playing for real BTC?
Edit: Here's a link to Bitzino's post:  (see my slight modifications to the algorithm in the About page to make it work for a wheel game).

The client seed for the division of the wheel uses just a timestamp. The client seed for the spin outcomes is user-controlled.

Thanks for the suggestions and kind words. Really happy to see encouragement coming from you. I will add min and max bets (right now it's unlimited...which is bad!). I'm still a newbie on bitcointalk.org, but hopefully soon I'll "graduate." Will also do HTTPS.

sgornick is correct. Provably fair means you can mathematically prove that the game is not cheating--it is playing by the stated rules. This doesn't necessarily mean the house does not have an advantage over the long run.
Thanks for trying it out, Throwing_Hard!

Yep, did this, but the rules of are that a single site may not be promoted more than once... But yes, reddit works the best in many ways.
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:47:18
Yep, but rules say no promoting twice.

I tried coinli.com (back when it was a Bitcoin Gem-like site where you bought the top spot from the previous owner), and it didn't work at all. Fortunately, someone bought the spot from me later so I got paid 10%.

Thanks for the info, SlickTheNick! I will definitely try your site. Yes, I'm realizing how cheap it is to get visitors with services like yours (as opposed to, say, CoinURL which is more than 10x more expensive).
Thanks for your kind offer! I'll sign up later today.
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:45:14
Thanks! I will look into this site.

Hello from North Seattle (near Northgate). I am a Bitcoin enthusiast. I've been operating  the web's most fun provably fair spin-the-wheel game, for a few months now. I'm now working on a second project with Bitcoin (generally speaking, an event outcome prediction site where users can bet on the outcome of events like sports games, elections, the Oscars, etc.).
