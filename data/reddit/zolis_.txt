Every no-coiner opinion matters. If you can't counter his or her argument with ease, than either there is a flaw in bitcoin or you should learn more.

That is why this Facebook coin never going to work. It's centralized and fixed to the dollar. What's the use then?
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:27:30
Just ban the internet. That'll solve the problem.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:20:36


Yes, but the whole point of taxation is they doing nothing and you giving them money.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:46:34
This could happen in the DISTANT future. Sad, none of us will live to see it. Bitcoin will be there though....

"worlds leading currency"
Governments will oppose it. They have monopoly over creating money, they will not let that out of their hands. In the long run this may also pose a danger to bitcoin itself. If bitcoin and the crypto world becomes too big, the world governments will do something about it. You can't just channel the world's fiat supply to a "private" circulation. It's like taking the FED's money and putting it somewhere they cannot reach it. From their perspective, it is thievery.

Next year is halving year!
@_date: 2019-07-31 08:20:01
So what? No financial product on the market can do what BTC does. HODL.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:09:56
Are you an expert? He specifically asked for an exper's opinion, someone who KNOWS where the price is headed. (Okay, off with the sarcasm..:))

Mr President knows that you should always buy when prices are highest. Buy exepsive, sell cheap. Instant formula for success.

@_date: 2019-11-26 07:04:37
Okay, so I'm gonna be that guy, but we still have problems with the following three things: blocksize, transfer time and transfer fees.  As we all know, the more the price increases, so do the transactions. I have no idea what 1M/BTC would do to the system, but it certainly wouldn't be good. Huge waiting times with even larger transaction fees. So, even if people were willing to buy and sell 1 BTC for 1M, it would be at huuuuge costs.
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:26:48
Bitcoin can only be killed with a 50%+1 attack. So long as it does not happen, bitcoin's gonna live.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:49:47
Actually if you come from a country where the currency is not worth that much (Hungary / Forint) it's even more interesting.
@_date: 2019-11-03 17:50:31
Well, I would rather say the semi-rise of 2015 (October) and 2019 (May?). Usually a year and a half before the halving and the (probable) bull market.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:15:36
I honestly don't understand this "bubble" theory. Okay, so bitcoin drops to, I don't know, very low, maybe lower than 1k. So what? What about the next day? And the one after that? Is it going to stay there? No! As long as it exists people are going to trade it, which has its highs and lows. Sure, there's a bear market now, but tomorrow's a new day. And the one after that and after that. Bitcoin's going to be around even when you're long gone from this world!
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:43:57
Wow! So many answers. So then answer me this: what is a rare painting? What is a piece of art? Something unique, that can not be replicated, thus to a certain group of people has a certain value. Check out CryptoKitties and ERC-721!
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:10:24
Can you do it with HDD? Or is speed that crucial?
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:31:45
I always though trading can be made into somekinda 3d computer game, and now here it is!
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:18:02
Question: is the foreseeable bull run 2020 (after the halvening) or 2021 (according to the 4-year-period)? What do you think?
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:49:42
And anyway, too much hassle. Bitcoin is the easiest investment.
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:52:26
Ever? If you think about it, you should never sell your bitcoin..:) As time passes by, it will become a rarity, a collectible ever increasing in value. No matter how old you are, it'll outlive you!
@_date: 2019-08-30 08:26:26
Bitcoin does not work without the Internet, BUT! Let's say there's major outage of internet/electricity somewhere. The cause could be anything, all from network failure to a war. So bitcoin is not available in that certain area. That does not mean your bitcoin is lost. If the mountain does not come to you then, obviously you have to change locations. But until you do, your bitcoin and your values with that are safe on the blockchain, should the day ever come you can access it again.
@_date: 2019-08-16 07:36:28
Okay, but to wait with something, first you have to buy...:)
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:18:32
Congratulations. For all our sake let's hope someday it will be worth a thousand times that 81,01 USD it is worth now.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:24:12
For rarity, there's always cryptokitties!
@_date: 2019-10-26 13:02:23
Why would anyone short-term trade with BTC? If you know where the price is going, you might as well know the winning lottery numbers.
@_date: 2019-08-31 07:51:01
Take your time! We got all the time in the world!
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:42:00
Okay, but what option to choose? [  It should be somewhere here, but no.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:01:52
I think this is this Google-quantum-computing again, people are afraid Google is going to steal their 0,1 BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:41:50
Actually, I think it's the revolutionary concept of noone "being at the top" why it's so hard to understand. It's a self-sustaining system, so long as there is people mining it and someone does not own 50%+1 of the mining power, it's gonna kepp on ticking. The computer is the "boss" which is hard to comprehend.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:08:29
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:50:56
.13 BTC
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:33:38
Is this selfpay?
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:20:23
I don't think we have time for that. Or maybe we do. But halving is next May and the clock is ticking.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:36:20
It's that quantum supremacy sh\*t like last time. Nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:43:29
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:24:08
So this is what 7 000 000 000 to 21 000 000 looks like? (or vica versa)
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:40:10
When is that exatcly?
@_date: 2019-10-31 13:12:46
I've been thinking about this. What is a "dead coin" anyway? Or "dead blockchain"? Is there such a thing? Okay, no people invest in a certain project *for the moment!* But time passes and if we hit a bull market again, there is no "guarantee" that these dead coins are not going to come back to life, to live a life of their own. Unless, of course someone 51% attacks them. But in any other case, they will be there as long as they exist.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:55:36
2024: The same with 100k.
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:44:15
You'll be dead by then. The world is big and BTC is just a tiny portion of it.

Why? You just sweat it out in prison, when you get out you'll have all the money for your AIDS treatmenrt.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:36:05
Yes, maybe. We don't know.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:49:25
Well, we have a little more than half a year to be this productive.
@_date: 2019-08-22 06:23:03
Now I get it!
@_date: 2019-10-24 08:48:15
Fow what? Encyrption in general? Then your 0.1 BTC is going to be the least of your worries. If they break cyrptography, then goodbye netbanking!
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:06:04
10080? Of course during the year, around summer it goes up to 15k, just for kicks (and the halving), then by December 10k.
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:24:34
I only buy the top.....
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:41:06

@_date: 2019-09-27 11:27:15
Could you be more specific? Which street, which ATM?
@_date: 2019-09-13 05:49:35
THEY ALL MOON DOWN HERE!!!
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:47:44
I wonder how big a dip it's going to be? And what are the long-term effects? I mean, if they want to keep the price low, they could just keep inventing quantum computers every day, don't they? Keep crying wolf, the investors will listen.
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:49:38


No. Money is the biggest ponzi in the world. Especially that you can print as much money as you want. I mean some poeople can print as much money as they want. You can only use it.
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:49:26
The only question is: can bitcoin handle that much market cap? Because as I witnessed, the bigger BTC grows, so do the transactions (and the fees). Won't this make Bitcoin a super-expensive, super-slow way to transfer money?
@_date: 2019-09-06 23:34:59
He's more like a major shareholder of a company that provides a service. It's like buying shares in a bank. Of course the CEO makes big money and holds most of the shares, that does not mean you cannot make money. But good answer nontheless. That could confuse a beginner.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:44:02
So isn't this bear run because of the quantum supremacy? I mean they spread the FUD of potentially breaking bitcoin. That's how the public percieves it. Can this be undone?
@_date: 2019-09-14 07:05:19
And even if, what's the use? Who cares?
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:47:36
Easy: if it's a Pozi scheme, who's at the top?
Edit: but one question: what happens when a mining pool grows so big it can perform the 50%+1 attack?
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:22:04
Sure it's late. You've only got a few thousand years left (or as much time as our civilization lasts) anyway.
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:50:38
What prophecy?
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:02:47
Can Bitcoin handle 100k?
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:50:12
I still think that this "quantum supremacy" is behind all of it. As soon as people realize that Google isn't going to steal their bitcoins tomorrow, the price will be back on track.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:31:04
