Prior to the fall of the Roman Republic during the Social War (91-88 BC).  Creditors foreclosed and put more land on the market decreasing land values.  This contributed to instability and civil war between Sulla and Marius.  Finally in 86 BC the government provided debt relief.  This finally provided stability to land prices.

OP was probably talking about expensive elastic goods and services.  You may think that you can buy a nicer car or have a longer vacation if you wait for the asset to increase in value for another year.

People were uncertain during the time of the Social War about the future so they started hoarding money which was part of the start of the deflationary spiral.  People were unsure if Rome would keep control over the Italian peninsula.  Also, King Mithridates VI of Pontus massacred Roman settlers in Asia Minor in 88 BC.  Romans that had lent out considerable sums of money to these settlers lost considerable sums of money.  Since the repayment of Roman loans in Asia was threatened, Roman lenders experienced a liquidity crisis and had trouble servicing their own debts. In turn, other creditors were bankrupted.  This trickled down to those that had lent money for land in Italy.  In order to raise cash they started calling in the loans and selling off their assets.

Yes, the internal and external shocks caused a deflationary spiral to the Roman economy.  The social war can be seen as an internal shock as many cities that had been loyal to Rome suddenly rose against Rome.  These cities were counting on becoming Roman citizens in the long run.  Things looked good as the tribune of the plebeians Drusus supported these legislative reforms. However, the response of the Roman senatorial elite to Drusus' proposals was to reject his ideas and assassinate him late in 91 BC.  This caused a sudden outbreak of the Social War.
