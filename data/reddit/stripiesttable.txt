I love you, you fucking tickle me at times lol
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:36:37
Same I hope I made the right call....
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:19:16
Tea leaves or crystal ball?
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:57:36
I don't just like everyone else its a guessing game
Just had a feeling we would not sustain 10k right now
I could be massively wrong then you can all laugh at me
I am ready to buy back in as I sold the lot 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:03:37
I bet you the fight is boring tonight
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:21:17
Come on drop ya bastard
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:53:32
username checks out
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:26:18
Please tell me you sold when you broke even
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:14:14
Neither are shitcoins
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:51:06
Well I sold the lot at 1am last night UK time just before I went to bed as there was a huge red dildo
Now sitting here 100% fiat
Wonder if your 12k prediction is still good?
If so that would make this a good time to FOMO back in
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:32:13
Wow she is a crypto warrior
Would bang it
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:25:19
What makes you say that? 
From a 'noob' I really would appreciate your input 
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:01:30
I don't get all the negativity
A slight dip and its the end of the world
I thought you lot were made of sterner stuff where has all the positivity gone
Its a great buy in opportunity
Facebook are releasing a shitcoin
Lots of investment this year
I think most of us are bullish long term
Man up bois
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:08:22
The last time BTC hit 10k it went to 11.7k then tanked to 6.5k
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:50:16
No you said the 5th lol
As I said then I hope you are right
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:28:02
Tea leaves or crystal ball?
Plus I hope you are right
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:17:25
Tea leaves or crystal ball?
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:22:56
Same relatively new to this space but one message the more seasoned pro's keep giving me is take profits
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:56:42
Probably 
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:31:45
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:52:36
I believe in BTC but I try not to get emotionally involved
Bcash was 500 euros a month later it was 1500 euros
He might be a prick but I like money
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:47:53
I actually believe this is temporary 
Waiting for the right buy back in price
It has dropped a few hundred not thousands lol
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:46:29
Well its being tested today.... could go either way
You have done well to stay strong so well done
If I was even I would get my fiat back and start again
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:44:03
Wont make me popular here :)
Sold the lot at 9600k
Want this sucker to drop
Fuck hodling take profits and get back in lower
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:21:47
Hopefully buy some now and profit Wednesday
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:20:44
More fool you, you could have sold at 15k tripled your profits and bought back in 7.5k for example
Yes I firmly believe one day it will moon but your mindset is bonkers
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:51:30
Based off what?
 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:14:53
I agree but while its volatile I will take my chances
Its too mundane just doing nothing
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:51:46
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:19:12
Thanks about to buy back in at a lower price
Buy high sell low?
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:26:30
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:37:57
You did call 12k on the 5th
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:33:04
Bummer :(
Did you short or long?
Edit: Try not worry too much I sold at 9600k and should have sold at 9900k
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:14:36
Ok pondering whether to load up now
Edit: might wait to see if it drops to the high 7's first (euros)
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:58:00
Fight has not started yet haye v bellew
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:18:48
Good for you hope you make lots of green
Never let emotions sway your decisions trade smart
Wish I had loaded up on them now
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:20:41
I know sort of ruing that decision
But as you know in this game forget what happened yesterday....
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:09:22
BGD's always lighten the mood till they get shorted 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:01:34
Already reasonably positioned pondering whether to FOMO in with some additional funds at my disposal
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:41:27
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:43:54
Smart investors will be stocking up on shitcoins right now
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:22:32
Sell the lot and buy back in later
I have a feeling we are gonna dip slightly once we hit 10k
Tea leaves of course
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:10:57
So basically you repeated what I said
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:13:44
Funny how the comments are still 'roughly' the same and apply to the current market
Am slowly coming to the realization that you just buckle in and wait.... 
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:29:46
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:25:26
Hmmm buy more... FOMO is a bitch
Already 'in deep'
Don't really buy into the don't spend more than you afford to lose
If it moons.... whether it be in 2 weeks/months/years I firmly believe new ATH will happen
Tea leaves of course
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:22:40
Go outside bro :p
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:31:24
what exchange did you use?
May as well have a dabble at that price
@_date: 2018-06-03 08:35:23
I cannot find a lot of information about BTCC I like to do my research before 'investing'
Is there any decent links/Reddit sub etc?
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:56:02
It might go up/down/sideways
We would all be rich if we knew
You are best to DCA
Or do what I do and just say fuck it, go all in when you get a feeling
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:55:57
I must be a moron

ok cheers ears

Had an interesting conversation with my wife this morning:
Her: The price of BTC has dropped because a third of it was stolen at the weekend
Bear this in mind she does not care about BTC we rarely discuss it
She is massively into shitbook, love island and all that bollocks
I asked her where she read this, she replied she did not know
Intrigued me that's the kind of battle 'we' are up against
Just a random throwaway article she has read somewhere
@_date: 2018-06-04 08:31:26
Never EVER tell anyone how much crypto you own
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:10:29
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:34:05

@_date: 2018-03-31 15:16:07
Funnily enough I am in your situation right now, I have around £20k, well not technically as I bought some yesterday but still have around £11k to invest. Maybe I can take some pointers from you? I am actually thinking of putting more in atm, I just have this feeling it is going to bounce back in the next 12 months...
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:58:39

Visited Malta three weeks ago for a long weekend what a lovely place, stayed in Sliema, visited the fish market, St Pauls Bay, St Julians
Could not recommend this place enough and the sockets in the hotel were 3 pin UK type. local boozer was ace as well 'The Salisbury Arms'
Now they are Crypto friendly as well jobs a good un
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:59:18
Fuck it went all in this morning (UK) wish me luck
Go big or go home lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:24:16

No one I know would entertain it
I do try to spread the word and fight the good fight :)

@_date: 2018-04-17 21:22:10
If I buy it drops, if I sell it goes up
Lol, always somehow end up back in profit though
Think I am addicted to this shit now, there is no way out

I just bought 1 btc for 6350 euros I guarantee the price will drop now
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:26:30
Ok thanks
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:08:34
It took me about 3 days to get my head fully around it all and that mainly consisted of watching the hundreds of youtube tutorials
It is super simple to get 'setup' the hard part is when to buy/sell/hodl
I just use GDAX have never bothered looking at another exchange and I only buy BTC
Get your finger out of your ass grow a pair of bollocks and man up
Good luck :)
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:08:06

@_date: 2018-04-13 17:01:18
Because if I had held my nerve I would be a lot better off now
I know in this game you have to follow through on your convictions and not think about 'what could have been'
Anyhow would you buy now or wait?
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:05:02
I have been in this space for about 3 months now have never fully commuted just buying a couple of btc here and there
Considering going all in ie 10 btc I have a hunch we will see gains in the near future
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:57:53
nocoiner confirmed
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:25:13
It did drop to 67k again like I said
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:49:05
Serious question what makes you say that?
I am gonna wait for another 48 hours before I make a decision have around 20 -30k GBP on the sidelines
If you look at my previous posts you will get an idea of where I am at, have not lost any money yet but have not gone 'big' yet
Have generally bought 2 btc and sold here and there to make smallish profits
Longterm plan is to hodl but I like the buying/selling its addictive
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:03:12
For me that all depends on your strategy
If you are a day trader you are watching like a hawk one would assume
If you are a hodler then you maybe check in hourly or every few hours or even every few days
I am a bit of both but if I am really busy I will check when I wake up then maybe at 6pm
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:02:27
Same speak euro for us europeans :)

Come on give the kid a break its scary when you first get in, once your confidence is up you spend every last penny you can spare...
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:22:14
But I did all the way through the dips just yesterday I was in a fuck it mood so I went a bit mad
If you look through my previous post's I generally am not the best at timing the market but I have never lost money 'yet'
For instance if it was at 10-20k I would not going all in but its still 'loose change' atm
But I agree in principle with your last statement 'how do you make sure you do that next time?'
I get bored if I am not 'doing something'
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:23:03
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:58:38
Ya know what I mean :)

@_date: 2018-04-25 13:55:35
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:00:26
so is 20k?
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:04:21
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:58:20
It took 3 days because I am thorough in my research
In reality it took a couple of hours, just when it comes to money/tech etc I like to be somewhat 'educated'
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:59:41
Will do, thanks buddy
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:21:46
So you had been robbed twice previously, let me weigh this up
You decide to go on a Saturday night with 4500 cash
No matter what city you live in anywhere in the world I would not seen carrying 4500 cash especially if I had been mugged twice previously
Monday morning maybe 
And I do not mean to insult you in any way
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:21:54
I predict a dump shortly in the next couple of hours
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:05:27
I am learning one thing slowly don't sell when it does 'something'
Oh and thanks :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:09:42
I went all in yesterday
I am currently down on my initial investment 5&amp;
Might buy some more fuck it
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:19:18
A bit late 'after the fact'
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:01:23
Its great when people try to tell you how to spend your money
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:56:09
We may not see a fall in the short term now that the trend is upwards, this will attract new investment methinks
I am thinking now is still a good time to get in, will wait to see what happens in the next few days
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:23:40
Ok let me rephrase stop being a tit
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:35:45
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:28:00
Fantastic story, good for you
Also your english is fine
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:07:06
Samourai wallet still in test phase but you can get it on the playstore
Not sure if its available for the apple nerds

@_date: 2018-04-14 23:09:47
I concur
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:08:16
But I didn't ask you yesterday, I made a conscious decision to buy based on FOMO which partially was the wrong decision
Thing is no one knows when its the high/low/sideways its all guesswork
Thats why TA is a load of shite
If it goes to 20k next week I can say I bought in at the two month high what a fool I was
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:04:58
This. I hate when people jump over others misery, 'you should have done this'
We do what we do with the best intentions, sometimes it works sometimes it does not
If its 20k next week you made the right decision
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:39:19
No I mean I predict a dump, still waiting to buy 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:05:13
Pancake mmmm
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:32:44
How many time are you gonna repeat that 
Apparently its been happening since 20k to 6k
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:48:56
Why reply to nocoiners
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:55:36
I really fcked up yesterday trying to be a smartass
Bought in last week at 5449 euros and sold yesterday at 5915 euros thinking it was a pump and dump during the 'happy hour'
Totally fell for the FOMO - I know this is scant consolation but I have not lost any money yet in my careful buying and selling just taking small gains here and there
Ok so what are my options now, would you wait for a few days or buy atm?
Have about 20k GBP good to go
And yes I know I am a fcking dick
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:45:42
It will go up/down/sideways
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:47:46
I hope it keeps going up good luck to you all I made a profit I was happy with
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:38:48
Sick of waiting for the 'right moment'
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:25:05
Non I just make random buys/sells when I see change
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:46:50
FOMO pure and simple
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:58:40
I have been trying to understand what shorting is for the last few days and I have a rough idea after some reading.
Please educate me here people, so I was basically thinking about what I think happened today, if huge numbers of people were shorting surely if enough people buy at a certain point then that would stop this trend?
My main concerns in the last week or so have been what happens if people just keep shorting continually the price will never move ie pump and dump continually?
Lastly do the shorters have a get out card ie a stop loss trigger
Again you need to speak to me like a 6 year old I am learning slowly
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:31:40
Well I just sold hope I made the right decision :/
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:50:22
