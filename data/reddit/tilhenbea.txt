I have a different perspective on food production and the costs. My family grows Produce, strawberries to be specific. The cost of growing is going up to the point where we are barely able to make any money on the farm. Gas, rent, labor, healthcare costs, are all growing and if retails ARE on average going up, those pennies are definitely not passed on to us, the producer.

So are all of the crazy price changes due to transactions that were placed days ago but are just now being processed?

Thanks for this. So why does the difficulty change over time?

How does the profitability change?

That’s crazy. It’s tough enough to make a decision to buy or sell without having to wait days for that action to take place.  
Am I right to think that all BTC transactions we are seeing NOW (whether buying, selling, exchanging or transferring) and the resulting price changes we are seeing NOW, actually took place 12-48 hours ago?

thank you...., yep I have the seed words, but didn’t know if that was the key or what!? Should I try to get the private key for the btc I have on trezor or is the seed good enough?

Thank you

Thx for the info and your time... Do you have a minute to explain the significance of  “Current Mining Pool Support” - 83.5% ?

This seems like a wise group so I would like your inputs on bitcoin’s volatility. I’m having a hard time believing it can ever NOT be volatile if it can be traded for a fiat currency or other coins at any time. If the value of bitcoin continues to rise, won’t there always be “cashing out” to realize gains?

When is the next fork scheduled to take place?

Great analogy! That was very helpful. Thanks for your input.
