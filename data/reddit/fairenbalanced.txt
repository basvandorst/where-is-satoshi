The problem with Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) is not necessarily the technology, its the economics. Do most people really need this technology in the first place? (Hint: no). 
Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency are fighting for a share of an already small "currency" market, mainly that of people who want a currency that  they can transact with anonymously, and perhaps, globally.
As an "investment"  however, all these cryptocurrencies are nothing but pyramids, with each buyer hoping to sell it to someone else for more than what they bought it for.

1) The security of cryptocurrencies is NOT proven in real world scenario. It is a theoretican construct. Can cryptos exist without being taken over by the Chinese government? We do not know that. Are they safer or more prone to high volatility due to the unregulated, online nature? We do not know that either.
2) Scalability is not proven in real life either. 
3) There is also the possibility of manipulation by inside players, which is definitely accounted for in the design, but we never know what issue might crop up in the real world.
 
There is a full possibility that cryptocurrency as a concept, is flawed and will never be adopted in real life.  At best, it is a really unproven concept that is subject to a mass frenzy right now.
What we have right now, is a classic bubble where some people are making wild claims to take money from the gullible / greedy masses.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:43:35
Bernie Madoff had a 38 year track record. Time doesn't prove anything. Bitcoin may have a value in terms of uses but it is a niche, not a major player in the world of currencies. Right now its valued as if it is a major player. Add to that, the niche world that actually requires cryptocurrency is being competed for by 1000+ players. The barrier of entry is non-existent for crypto technology. One of these days a government is going to start using blockchain technology for their own currency and that will be the end of these unregulated science projects.

@_date: 2017-12-22 23:55:31
Internationally, the US dollar is literally backed by the US economy because international exchange rates are set based on international trade, export-import, how much demand there is for the US dollar internationally and so on. Countries need the US dollar to buy oil for example. Also countries that try to use other currencies face sanctions or worse from the US. So there are many reasons for the dollar's pre-eminence internationally.
Within the US, absolutely, people accept it because they think they have no choice.. and if you are suggesting that Bitcoin out of all the 1000's or 10000s of crypto that can and will come up in the future, will even come close to replacing the US government backed currency in the US without massive intervention from the government,  I cannot help you there. Right now Bitcoin is in a speculative bubble where people are valuing it more than what its really going to be worth as a currency, that is my honest opinion.  
Anyway, why not read books on how currencies are valued and how money works, maybe you may get a fair idea.

But you are trusting the majority miners sitting in China, and the programmers of the currency, the mathematical soundness and the economic soundness of the concept and design, and the major holders and the centralized exchanges to not game the system.

There is no comparison between stocks and this speculative market of crypto. 
Many people hold stocks for the long term based on the company's history, its prospects, the current market for its products and services, its management and so on. If you perform value investing, long term investing barring a once in a lifetime event such as a market crash, your investments will mostly be stable, and even provide dividends.
Sure stock market buys can be gambling depending on the sector, the company, and all kinds of variables. But let's say you put your money in a blue chip, you can expect not to lose most of that money even if you leave it there for 5 years, and in some cases you can expect to get some returns as well.
With Bitcoin we don't know where our investment will be in the next 5 hours.  
To be honest, I don't really want to explain the difference between gambling and investing out here, there are enough books out there to help you out.

Any country knows, that if they have dollars, they will be able to buy oil from the middle east, among other things.

Internet is the wrong comparison to be honest. At best blockchain is 
somewhat comparable to the RDBMS and cryptocurrencies are applications built on top of the database. There are many successful applications, including Amazon (Apple sells hardware, so it does not count) and Google, but there are many more flops too.
And remember all these applications(cryptocurrencies) are fighting for a slice of a much more limited pie than the internet companies were fighting for.

Equating gold to sports memorabilia is like comparing Tom Cruise to a character actor in Kazakhstan. 
Gold is recognized and valued the world over, for all its wonderful properties as are diamonds Sports memorabilia is highly niche. If you ever visit South India you will be overwhelmed by the amount of Gold the men and women out there wear. Gold is a globally valued asset.
Baseball cards may have a market in the US, (to be honest I wouldn't know a valuable baseball card if I fell over it) and Soccer cards may have some value in brazil, but try and sell a highly valuable baseball card in Brazil, and you are unlikely to get any money for it.  
There are very few things like Gold, Diamond and Platinum that are a known and recognized store of value and in-demand the world over.

If bitcoin had a monopoly on the world of cryptocurrency, I would say yes, it may even be worth a trillion or so in terms of its true value, although I would be guessing (assuming that the technology behind it really can scale and has no serious unknown flaws). It doesn't, not nearly.
So you seriously think that out of the 1000s of crypto currencies out there, Bitcoin will capture the entire market share of the market that cryptocurrencies purport to serve (which is the anonymous / online cash market) , and will never have any competition, in the form of existing or upcoming cryptocurrencies, will never be regulated by the government  (or governments by agreement) and so on. I personally don't believe it for a second.

I am not convinced that bitcoin will make the dollar irrelevant just by going up in value though. Bitcoin is currently being treated as a commodity like a piece of gold or diamond, or a picasso or a van gogh painting. It could go up to any number without affecting the validity of other currencies.
What would make the dollar irrelevant is large scale adoption of bitcoin (or some cryptocurrency) for day to day transactions, not just by people, but also by governments. Governments use the USD today to buy oil. If governments start using bitcoin to buy oil, then the USD will crash. I somehow do not see this happening though.

Sure the dollar is relatively more stable than many asian currencies (and even the pound or the Euro), but the asian currencies are nowhere near as unstable as any of the crypto currencies out there. I mean compared to cryptocurrencies they are solid as rock.

You should look up Bernie Madoff. His "too complicated for outsiders to understand" Ponzi scheme started in the early 1970's and was discovered around 2008, so it took 38 years for the public to finally catch on to the fraud. 
Now I am not saying that Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is  fraud, and in fact I believe in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but in the absence of any real understanding of where Bitcoin fits in among all the other currencies, crypto and non, how its technology will scale, what issues could crop up in the future including government control and so on, will bitcoin ever reach adoption levels to match its valuation etc, there are a lot of wild claims being made, in other words, rampant speculation, mostly encouraging people to put their hard earned money into it. 
What is "Fair value" for bitcoin, no one knows, but the people who want to get rich off it are encouraging others to join the game by presenting all sorts of charts and analysis which I simply do not believe they can have any sort of certainty over. It is more advertising than analysis. Now wall st has also jumped in the game. Things like this don't usually end well for a vast majority of investors, and many times the general public too..

Cryptocurrency (not necessarily bitcoin) has some value because it is a technology whose design (the distributed ledger) promises an anonymous , secure , online medium of exchange ( a bit like cash in the real world), which is something some people value a lot. Something that can be hidden from governments to evade taxes, and protect activists from government intrusion alike.
  
For example, most people are quite happy using Visa or Mastercard to buy stuff online (like at amazon.com), but others may want to buy dodgy stuff (like weed) that they  don't want traced back to them in case the seller gets arrested, they don't want the seller's records showing the buyer's names and addresses. They have here a coin that they can send to transfer value anonymously, and instantly. 
As another example, people may want to send money to their relatives in some african country whose own currency is crap, and a cryptocurrency promises to meet an easy way to instantly transfer value online without involving banks, or corporations, or any government. Way better than sending diamonds via fedex!!
So in theory, cryptocurrencies have a number of applications. Now the question is -- are the current currency designs scalable and bulletproof in terms of security? Are they bulletproof in terms of international economics? Is this even a practical technology, or not, or can maybe governments or big corporations make it work or can these decentralized guys do it? All questions for the future.. 
Sure, if bitcoin is absolutely perfect and can tackle all these questions and more, yes it has some value depending on how big the market for using anonymous digital currencies finally is.. but we still can have no idea how much.

I think your question should be, "why is it worth US Dollar 14000 when it was US Dollar 1000 a year ago, and is 1 BTC to 14000 USD fair value?". 
The answer is that people are speculating on the back of wild claims (BTC 1 million, BTC 5 million, will replace USD!!) by some vested interests to spark the average joe's greedy lizard brain, an impression of scarcity (21 million ONLY!) 
Conveniently ignoring any countering logic for example: 
-There are 1000 other competitors out there and any company / government can roll their own crypto, and thus the supply of digital coins is not limited, it is infinite, 
- Bitcoin is one in 1000 currencies fighting for a share of a niche market of people who want currencies that they can spend anonymously, with an unproven design.
- We have no idea how these currency designs will work in practice, and what problems they will encounter.
- How governments will react if these coins really do start becoming inconvenient
- The impact of price volatility on their viability as a currency
.....and so on
So to answer your question, there is a bubble based on wild speculation, and no one really knows what the real value of bitcoin or any other crypto currency is, into the uncertainty are jumping both greedy people trying to get rich quick and sharks trying to take money from the masses as usual, but ultimately no one really knows where these crypto currencies will end up in terms of value.
EDIT: You did say "sensational bs", so I am guessing you are also seeing the BS so will have some perspective.

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:07:58
It's chicken and egg right.. 
Also there are other reasons for people not to want to take bitcoin as payment other than price instability -- is it undeniably secure, or are we simply handing off control to the Chinese government? Will the US government intervene if it does start to challenge the Dollar? These are all questions that are unanswered at the moment IMO..

It's not just computer skills that are required though, its also a deep understanding of Economics and Finance that is needed to evaluate Bitcoin and other currencies, which, at the best of times is a highly inexact science.
In fact the science of people manipulation and greed through false advertising and wild claims is more exact and is probably what is in play at the moment.

All I want to say is, you are analyzing something that cannot be analyzed, and you are probably looking at the wrong thing. Its not the technology that you should be looking at, its economics and politics. Bitcoin is a big fail in both areas (as are other decentralized cryptocurrencies)
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:22






So, firstly, I did not ask the original question, it was someone else.
It is not just the military, it is also the perceived economic power of the country, the amount it exports vs the amount it imports, is it long term trusted vis a vis its debt, and so on. In short, the economic and military credibility of the country vis a vis other countries backs the currency. This is not "network effect", the exchange rates are set between international bankers and governments based on relative supply demand of goods and services... we need books to help explain the reason why currencies are valued the way they are, cannot be done in a reddit post.
Every now and then there are collapses in a country's currency, but such events are few and far between. Most currencies are pretty stable day to day in terms of their value. The collapse of communism was a once in a lifetime event, for example.
Many countries are simply not strong enough to achieve global recognition of their currency. Try spending a Pakistani rupee in Europe or in America. Now try spending a US dollar in Europe or in Pakistan. This kind of power is not easily achieved.

All these questions are impossible to answer with any degree of certainty for experts, let alone non experts. This whole crypto is an unproven technology. What's worse is that the business model at this scale is unproven as well. 
You need people with years of experience as economists , mathematicians and computer scientists to come together and debate and discuss before you can even begin to get close to answering these questions accurately. The rest of it is  wild speculation.

But for a global agreement to develop, where billions of people think that something has value, and nearly the same value in every country, you need government backing, or multinational corporation backing, or a historical global acknowledgement of value as exists in the case of gold and diamonds.
Often, even currencies issued by governments don't reach this level of acceptance. Try spending a pakistani rupee in the US vs try spending a US dollar in Pakistan. (Hint: you won't be able to spend the rupee)

The internet is a bad comparison for blockchain. The internet involves a whole host of hardware and software technologies along with all kinds of international standards organizations and governments coming together.
Blockchain is really a secure database, and if you called it something like RDBMS (Oracle), yes, I would tend to agree with you, even though that is stretching it a bit given the power of the RDBMS. But the entire internet? Hyperbole.
Of course, if one was trying to sell people on Bitcoin, one would use all kinds of ridiculous comparisons.

Price per coin multiplied by number of coins determines Market Cap.  Same goes for stocks. Market cap of a company (stocks multiplied by price per stock) tells you what the company is worth, as per the stock market. For example, market cap of Apple is 900 Billion dollars. Is Apple really worth 900 billion dollars? To get even close to answering that question that you have to do a lot of hard core analysis of the company, its underlying business, its future prospects. The Market cap of the stock is an indicator of what the market thinks that the stock is worth, nothing more, nothing less.
As far as bitcoin goes, its huge market cap tells you nothing but that all the speculative people buying bitcoin in this huge bubble bitcoin market are failing to do due diligence, and simply do have enough of an understanding of economics nor technology, and therefore think it is worth way more than it really is worth. All they want is to jump on the bandwagon and make money. 
If you think all these people buying and selling bitcoin (the bitcoin market) have done any analysis other than reading memes on reddit and watching salesmen on youtube, you are sadly mistaken. I doubt that there is actually any way to actually analyze bitcoin to arrive at its "true" value except in hindsight.

This is a good satire on the real problem with bitcoin. If only a few people hold most of the coin out there, they can charge anything they want from the people desperate to acquire it -- a bit like the price of food during wartime -- so the price of bitcoin in terms of USD could simply not reflect its real value in any sense, its just hoarding and profit taking by the hoarders on the back of all the bitcoin mania.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:41:51
You don't seem to understand international politics. Currency absolutely has value because of the military. Countries all over the world buy oil in what currency? In dollars. How do you think America protects that monopoly over the currency used to buy and sell energy? With its military. Saddam Hussein tried to use other currencies to buy and sell his oil, and look what happened to him. You seem to have no idea how the world works bro. If a country wants to buy oil, it needs dollars, that is why the US can get away with printing dollars and yet the dollar remains strong against other currencies.
Of course this is oversimplified, and the US dollar has value for reasons other than fear, namely the high GDP of the US, the large corporations that sell their stuff all over the world and so on, but the US backing is the only reason that the dollar has value.

I don't think he is right here. Sure, bubbles may be impossible in terms of blockchain and cryptocurrency, but the bubble right now is in the exchange price of bitcoin to the US dollar and other currencies, which is eminently possible and not precluded by the ledger technology.
In other words, yes, in the world of cryptocurrency there will be no inflation and it will be all roses and songbirds, but what we are looking at is bitcoin being treated as a commodity priced in fiat currency, and commodity price bubbles in fiat currency are not a new thing.

Tell you what.. the reason that Bitcoin's price has risen so much and so fast is not because the people investing are planning to ditch the US dollar and use bitcoin to buy groceries and pizza and to send it to their relatives in Greece and whatnot. 
People are looking at bitcoin as a commodity, much like gold, or silver, or diamonds, or a painting by van gogh. Something that they expect will rise in value so that they can sell it for more *in US dollars*. This expectation is being pumped up by the marketing machine that says its the next internet, the next Facebook, the next this the next that. Its also an online thing, so trading in bitcoin is really quick and easy - at least buying bitcoin is.
Are they really critically analyzing the technology behind bitcoin, the likelihood of it replacing regular currencies that are used not only by most people to buy groceries and whatnot but also by governments to conduct trade with each other, to buy oil, the drawbacks of bitcoin and so on? I doubt that most people currently involved in the frenzy are thinking of all that. 
So people are buying bitcoin with the expectation that it will appreciate, like a stock or a commodity, and they are expecting to sell it back for US dollars or whatever currency, so that they can go out and buy cars and houses and whatnot. 
The irony of this is completely lost on people - that the majority of bitcoin investors want to cash out of it when it goes high enough and convert it back to fiat currency and they are trash talking the same fiat currency all the way.

But seriously speaking.. bitcoin is a commodity at the moment that anyone in the world can buy with relative ease. Young people around the world - India, China Japan, Korea, NA are putting money into it with the expectation of making a lot of money. It is a truly global bubble IMO, unlike stock or currency bubbles which are generally restricted to certain countries. 
There is also the possibility of illegal shenanigans going on - after all so many East European countries involved, China involved, you cannot discount the possibility of organized crime or even crooked governments being involved in pumping the price up somehow. 
Or it could just be a billion average Joe shmoes like you and me trying to better their lives and make hay while the sun shines.
One thing is for sure as far as I am concerned -- I doubt that these guys are all buying bitcoin so that they can use it to buy groceries and pizzas and sent it to Aunt Jane in Senegal. They all want it to rise rise rise so they can sell it for more than what they bought it for.

Yeah the paper money backed by the US government and the US economy, only the richest, most powerful economy in the world bar none. A piece of paper that you can spend in any country you want and buy goods and services, no questions asked. Even many countries cannot claim that recognition and strength for their currencies - try spending a Sri Lankan rupee in the US or Europe at some random store. Now try spending a US dollar anywhere in Europe or Sri Lanka. That is power, and not easy to achieve for a currency by the way. There are whole books in the fields of international trade and economics that explain why currencies get their value.
Mainstream economists have been calling bitcoin and other crypto play money and ponzi scheme for years, yes, but this is the first time the general investing public also gets to see the pretend "emperor" in his full naked glory. Not a good sight.

It is actually close to the total amount that has been invested in it. You can deduce from the market cap, how much the current bitcoin holders in total have spent to buy all the coins they hold. 
Right now, the market cap of bitcoin is 271 Billion. This means that if you sum (the dollar bank balances of all the people who hold bitcoin today minus their balances when they did not have the specific bitcoin they are holding right now), the total should come pretty close to 271 billion dollars. 
Now I am only saying dollars, but since bitcoin is global, you have to use each countries' own currency for the holders who paid in that currency and convert it to dollars in your calculation. You also have to account for all the other cryptocurrencies since they are also interchangeable with bitcoin, and the same person could be holding multiple cryptocurrencies, so the calculation should be somewhat complicated.
If you ask me to guess, I would say that the total amount invested in bitcoin is closer to Market Cap of bitcoin - 30 billion USD.

Far as I know, its just that this is a volatile asset, so this is normal.

This is BS.. First, most major inventions happen with slow painstaking research, over a lot of time and build upon research and the work of many people. No irrational exuberance there, and many times, very little money.
Major inventions and discoveries are popularized or adopted by the public through work done by large corporations and governments, yes, but the adoption curves are unlikely to be irrational, and secondly have little to do with exuberance on the part of the public. 
Irrational exuberance just leads to money being transferred from a lot of unfortunate souls to a few lucky / predatory people. It leads to gambling and speculation,  economic collapse and job losses.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:22
I would rather be smart than tough. And humble enough to admit that I neither understand economics, nor mathematics enough nor can I see the future, so if I put money on this crypto crap, I am gambling blind.
None of that 50,000, 1 million crap
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:47:26
I personally think its the people who are the latest to the party, the last batch which is also necessarily the biggest batch who put in the most money for the least gains and ultimately the biggest losses.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:28
IMO 1 million BTC is a cruel joke being played by the bitcoin hoarders on the lemmings transfering their hard earned money to them.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:43:59
So thats 1500% in 40 years (tuition) vs 1500% in one year (Bitbubble).. I guess the bitcoiners have no idea how to spot logical fallacies.. no wonder there is a bubble..
There is real irony here... If all the people who are inflating the bitcoin bubble really paid attention in college, there might not have been a bubble...
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:05
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:23:52
I've been wondering that too..
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:04:57
Well, people in a bubble usually see it in hindsight only.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:02
Crypto, issued and backed by governments or large corporations, sure, not this play money crap.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:22:43
You have a choice, of 1 of 1000 plus (and growing cryptos), sure, and you also don't know when that choice will be shut down by any given government either.

Good for u --- best kind of luck!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:48:45
"Brilliant young minds" you are kidding me. The vast population investing in this crap is just people trying to get rich quick who have neither the time nor the money to understand technology or more importantly, international economics. 
Its the brilliant minds who are telling you that its a bubble, stay away from it.

Like issue cryptocurrency and give them cool names like "Bitcoin" "Litecoin" "Cryptocrackcoin" and so on.

Ive been saying this since bitcoin was last 12K, all the way to 19K, and now back down to 12K and still no one wants to know the truth it seems.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:20
No, I think its closer to 84.445%
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:19:24
No one can know if any given crypto has value or not, it's all marketing to pump up the price. Cryptocurrency is an unproven technology and bitcoin is in a huge speculative bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:26:46
This whole crypto bubble is a big pump and dump

Finally the plankton begins to see the light...

Ok... what does that have to do with anything?!
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:26:06
To be honest, this is FUD
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:29:54
No one knows the value of any given crypto, especially not the guys speculating on it. You really need an economist and a mathematician with no vested interest to help you out there.

Im questioning the term "investment". 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:37:42
Well, the bitcoiners want to get out of Fiat currency, right? So here it is!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:08:41
Well, the current valuation of cryptocurrency is based on the "greater fool" theory, that there is always a greater fool to buy the currency than the price the current fool paid for it. However, yes, the fools will get a bit scared by this volatility. 
None the less, fools lack long term memory capacity in addition to lacking basic reasoning skills, so I would not be surprised if they dip their feet into the shark infested pond again in a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:51:45
Yeah it wont be much different from 2017 actually, most people don't own any bitcoin now, and they won't own any bitcoin in 2018.

Err.. actually this part is not for you, it's to protect the merchant from customers who take delivery of the product or the service and then stop the credit card payment or cancel the check . This happens a lot and it costs business billions of dollars per year. This kind of feature helps adoption by businesses.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:45:51
Except that most people cannot keep money locked up like that for years on end.. they have life events, marriages, illnesses, kids etc that they need liquid cash for.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:35:42


Yes, but you are neglecting to mention the basis for the agreement / discussion, which is the credibility and power of: 
- the institution backing the currency (in case of fiat currency),
- the perceived value and scarcity of the physical substance itself by human society (in case of gold and diamonds and platinum)
- the perceived value and credibility of the technology backing the cryptocurrency, and the perceived future size of the market (in the case of crypto currencies)

They probably placed a $2 million bet that its price will be $100 in 2018 as well! That's how traders work.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:45
These comparisons are meaningless, I can quote a thousand poorly designed projects that failed to scale. Cryptocurrency especially is critically dependent on its design being bulletproof from a perspective of both scaling and security. I think we will find out in hindsight that neither design goals were met.

Ask yourself this, would you spend the bitcoin on a pizza and diet coke if you knew its value would have doubled in a couple of weeks' time? If yes, then that's the kind of attitude Bitcoin needs.
