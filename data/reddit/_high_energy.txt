Just for context. Bitfinex changed yesterday which meant every single major exchange had dropped the bcash name. 
Then when bitstamp listed with the name people freaked out. 
I kind of feel bitstamp did this intentionally for free advertising. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:06:44
A 51% attack doesn't really work in reality. If someone tried it the big nodes would just blacklist any block in the attack chain. So who is going to pay millions for an attack that won't do much other then prove the futility of the 51% attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:11:24
Where did you get the idea to call it bcash? If the detractors invented the name and use that name why do you use it?

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:58:22
You are correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:30:56
Well yes but this post is really about lighting channels not lighting network. It isn't clear how the network version will work practically yet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:36:37
They have a smaller full node blockchain and it grows slower as well because they actually prune. You have been misled by people pointing to historical node size which are nodes of no use. 
They have already implemented uRaiden on the main net which is the same as lighting channels. That was just last week. 
They have sharding in the roadmap which Bitcoin has no equivalent for planned. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:56:00
Well I'm just saying if you call it "Bcash" you look as silly as people who call Bitcoin "Bitcore" or "Segcoin". I care because its a "stupid flame war is toxic to both communities" and I would like it to stop.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:51:32
The masses that use it don't call it Bcash. Name a exchange that still uses that name. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:36:04
Core doesn't own Bitcoin. They make the most popular implementation. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:08:49

Um they pretty much are the  community for people who use or are invested in Bitcoin Cash. Can you name a bigger one?
And what does have to do with anything?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:21:31
What is BCash short for?  You see the inherent problem with trying to argue that is it's official name. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:20:40
Its not trivial and they have stated they are working on it.
Considering segwit usage has dropped below 10% again I don't why coinbase is being singled out here. The all time high was 18% a month ago.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:17:01
I'm interested in how they define bitcoin legally. If it is approved their definition will have to be considered. Lets say bitcoin hardforks into to chains (A and B). If chain B fits their definition it will have a big value boost as it would the chain linked to the EFT. 
Actually the difficulty of defining this makes me think the EFT won't be approved.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:50:31
How exactly does increased supply of space in blocks increase prices?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:02:29
If that is the case Bitcoin is dead without a pow change. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:07:43
Possibly he could be referring to the selfish mining strategy where a coalition with 25%-50% of hashing power can share blocks internally and release in batches. This hurts everyone but it hurts anyone not part of the coalition the most which can force them into submission.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:45:00
BU allows for bigger blocks. Nothing says they would use them. The ones that keep mining empty blocks could even want to make blocks smaller. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:39:42
120 million dollars? or ~1% of mined bitcoins that are likely not lost. Yes that is quite a bit. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:58:37
True but completely misses the point. Not having the majority of hashing power means the miners could use Nakamoto concensus to erase a days worth of transactions. In other words the minority chain is insecure.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:29:00
They can orphan any block that doesn't signal BU. 
51% is 100% if they are determined enough. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:30:25
Proving a hard fork doesn't matter would increase confidence.

Which chain would the Winklevoss EFT be linked to? Does anyone have an idea how they define what bitcoin is?
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:59:35
BU sounds pretty stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:43:09


The only thing that matters.


That's where your wrong. If difficulty drops then your chain is no longer secure against the hash power of BU miners who could easily reak havoc on your unsecured chain.
Bitcoin is secured by proof-of-work. It's value is based on its security. The miners do the work. Without them doing the work the chain is not secure and the value would plummet.
In the context of the comment chain we are replying to the Winklevoss EFT explicitly has said they would side with the hashing power winner (after 48 hours) in case of a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:10:48
Sue? I would think they would be bankrupt if this happened​. No money to spend on a frivolous law suit. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:03:26
That is beyond retarded. If BU does their hard fork and has the computation power for 48 hours (which they would) then the EFT would say they are the real Bitcoin. If BU then collapses what happens to holders of the EFT?  
The EFT should maintain coins from each chain to maximize the shareholders value. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:55:25


I think your going to want to set your sights lower. lol.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:13:45
And it doesn't occur to you the miners could completely screw over your unsecured network if you fork them off. How did everyone here seem to forget Bitcoin is secured by proof of work. The miners are the only ones who do that work. Without the majority of them your network is not secure regardless of how many big players support it economically or in theory.   
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:06:09
Sounds like a legal way for the twins to pocket a shit load of money if something this stupid gets approved. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:33:02
Not yet since you ​can't really trade for BU yet (a future that expires in less than a year isn't the same thing). If he wouldn't make the trade after the hard fork then yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:52:29
By spoofing timestamps they don't even need to stop mining to reduce difficulty.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:13:38
They have the difficulty releif cheat so it actually doesn't matter to them.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:32:28

@_date: 2017-08-22 03:16:56
Especially easy if the two miners are the same person.

So if it wasn't profitable again and no one mines it then it will EDA again and again until it is more profitable. EDA is an attack on BTC and it will be successful if no one here admits it.  Why can't Bitcoin have continuous difficulty adjustment like ethereum?

Sorry for your loss but this is another example of why "if I only bought back in..." is fallacious. Lots of people bought and then lost their coins in various ways.

The distributed routing part is the vaporware part that lighting network skeptics don't think will happen. Instead we will get a spoke network with a Visa/Mastercard type  sitting in the middle collecting fees. Since onchain transaction will cost a fortune we won't have a choice except pay the fee to those companies.

Okay then. So you are going to stick to the sentiment that "a raspberry pi can handle 1mb but a desktop can't handle 8mb".

@_date: 2017-11-12 21:11:17
It will stabilize blocks at an average of 1 per 10 minute. That means no more extra inflation which OP correctly points out is a bad thing for price and reward schedule.
Where do you get the idea increased difficulty lowers price? I don't think there is a causal relationship, but if there were it has always been price and difficulty increase together.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:10:11
So if a temporary 30% hashrate drop caused that. What does 30% more users do permanently.

Also depending on security features you could feed that same cash through over and over to buy Bitcoin.

You mean my pretty standard PC can't handle 8mb blocks? That's where your wrong.

If you do like Bitcoin also don't use it because with those fees.... something something...

Since the fork is still following all the regular consensus rules it can still be accepted by the non updated nodes if it is the highest block, whereas is they expanded the consensus rules the fork would never be accepted by non updated nodes (hard fork).
But I'm seriously interested in how the original concept for UASF would work to reach 95% segwit support if it didn't involve orphaning non-segwit blocks?
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:13:54
Segwit allows Lighting Network which allows trust-less off-chain payment channels that only need on chain transactions to settle a channel.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:27:42
Check the price after the UASF? Was that to complicated for you?

So then why did you write a post saying it is insanely underpriced?

Bitcoin price near all time high doesn't make sense for timing?
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:50:56
The UASF doesn't require any number of nodes to activate. If only one node joined that node would activate the UASF on the prescribed date and would sit in forked chain by itself.
Since the number of nodes doesn't matter a Sybil attack is completely irrelevant.

I think the global activation condition is clear (specific date), what isn't clear is the conditions that individual operators should activate UASF nodes ahead of the global activation condition.

Even if they got 33% support you would still have blocks every 30 minutes. An inconvenience for a month.

@_date: 2017-04-11 05:21:19
If it has majority of hashrate then there wouldn't be any fork, as the non-UASF miners will still try to mine the longest chain which would be the UASF chain. So there would only be one coin still.

The difference is in Bitcoin they might actually use the larger blocks. The BCH isn't really tested since they average about 13 txs per block. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:06:27
BU was about emergent concensus, sticky gates and all that stuff. BCH is just hardcoded bigger blocks.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:19:12
I don't spam ethereum stuff in this forum out of respect for the no altcoin rule, however if you guys want to go into it....
Ethereum full nodes don't require to keep all the data. The pruning is so advanced that the true size is something like 6-11gb depending on the client you use. The rest is just archival data of no use to anyone.
Ethereum is used. In fact over the last half year it consistently processes more transactions then Bitcoin. 
Ethereum is actually working towards the long term solution to dealing with centralized mining cartels. PoS is hard to get right but destroying centralization and saving half a billion on electricity a year is nothing to scoff at.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:23:43
Well ethereum has more then double the nodes. Pruning really works.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:46:38

As BTC is hitting 57% market share (down from a stable &gt;80% a year ago) and a "solution" 14 months from now is suppose to be comforting.
Don't forget LTC was identical to BTC in almost every way. Now it is 14 months ahead. Lots of greedy speculators are diving into it right now causing a bubble probably, but that bubble can gets news bringing in more speculators and things can get out of control for BTC.
"Solution" is in marks because a UASF might not even work. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:11:32


That is the dream isn't it. But the best hope now is a UASF 14 months from now.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:23:10
Look how the total number of nodes increases at the exact same time the UASF nodes increase. This means the established nodes (exchanges, miners, etc..) are probably not the ones making up the UASF support.

Except he has tweeted that he has used it on test net. Why believe he wouldn't use it on the main chain as well? Unless he simply likes wasting electricity which is pretty unbelievable.


I never said otherwise. The $100 million dollar advantage is the saved electricity. Now is it wrong of him to save energy. Certainly not. He is just playing by the rules and nobody should fault him for that. But it is wrong to block technical advancements for the sole purpose of keeping the rules working to his advantage when that advantage is of zero benefit to the network as a whole.


Do you have any idea how big bitcoin is? Anyway he has done a fairly good job of taking control of bitcoin don't you think?

That is a good thing. They should cost less because they place less burden on the network.

Does the method used to create the coins matter intrinsically? I think the real question is how much of the alt market share is not accessible to the market. 
I think the [57% figure]( excludes coins that purposely hold back a huge number of coins just for the purpose of inflating market cap.

Unless you're a purist it doesn't make a difference where the coins started for someone buying now.

We don't know the final total but that is irrelevant, because we do know its growth rate. The bitcoin price and ethereum market prices both have their coin distribution schemes priced in. Perhaps ethereum being non capped pushes down its price, but that is known and already factored into the price.

Ethereum for one. Very profitable at the moment if you have under 20 cent electricity.  
I would probably only run that card at 50-66% so you don't damage it.

So I'm mining ethereum on my PC. Explain that.  
Also how is ETC possible if they are centralized?

I'm not sure if you understood what he meant?
The blockchain of ETH is immutable under the rules of ETH, but just like BTC people can do whatever they want in a hardfork. BTC doesn't have any additional feature that ETH didn't have that prevents users hard forking to rewrite the blockchain. ETC still exists for those users that didn't agree with forking.

Trade volume is also easier then market cap to artificially inflate.

Rebought from who? Well whoever that person is now takes the USD out of bitcoin.
I still don't think you have fully thought through the fact that every sale has a buyer and a seller.

So if I sell 1 coin back and forth between me and my friend for $1000 1000 times what does your method give?
If you suggest some net measurement of buys and sells then remember every buy is also a sell so there is zero dollars flowing into Bitcoin.

How is staying in a chain that likely will be erased by a reorganization into the UASF chain a valid option? I guess there are 3 choices but that one is just suicidal.

The keyword is "from". Of course the node sees the other transactions.
