Yes - if there was an alternative.
I have been waiting forever on Bitstamp (sent KYC, id etc. - waiting for them to process).
Kraken - well. I don't really trust or like them.
What are my alternatives?
Also I actually do like Gdax.
* It's faster/better working than the other exchanges I have tried (which does not handle FIAT).
* It has 0% fee for maker.
* It has zero fee on outgoing BTC transfers - so I can send my money to e.g. Binance for free!

And if you leveled you probably would be broke.

I don't agree.
Choosing a good brainwallet isn't easy. And all the obvoius ones will be hacked. But that's not to say that brainwallet doesn't work!
If you take e.g. a bible verse from even and old translation in a different language (e.g. dutch, swedish or another "small" language) I am still convinced that you'll be an easy target!
Even if you "misspell" a few words (e.g. using leet/H4x0r etc) you'll still be a rather easy target.
But if you do it "right" and combine different things, - something personal to you or something that's not to hard for you to remember. I do believe that it'll work and that you'll be able to remember the code forever - even if you harddisk dies!
If could (and this is of course just and example) be:
11Jan2001 Peter Nelson "One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!" 1 3 7 11 12 21 24 28
If you got married on january the 11th 2001 to a guy called Peter Nelson and you happend to like Star Trek, and have the lotto number 1, 3, 7, 11, 12, 21, 24 and 28 that use use again and again (e.g. because 1 and 11 is the date for you husband Peter Nelson and the rest is probably for you and your children/siblings/...)
The key is, I believe:
1. There are two type of attackers - one who attacks (or tries) everyone. They will use all kind of dictionaries and add stuff and use common misspelling systems etc. etc. This is especially easy on cryptocurrency since the blockchain can be downloaded. So without EVER exposing you ill intend you can just go ahead, make you tables and look for a fool. And whenever someone transfer money to an adress in you table, - you react quickly and takes the money.
2. Someone attacking just you. They will know even more about you, but there will be quite a few who will try though.
It is important that you address both! So All of your names and birthdays for everyone in your family will not be enough! Probably it will be enough for 1), but certainly not for 2! One or a few concatenated quotes probably is enough for 2), but certainly not for 1!
Of course every one is paranoid, - and so are you. So you might add just a little bit more. Perhaps ending up with:
Only the paranoid will survive! 11Jan2001 Peter Nelson "One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!" 1 3 7 11 12 21 24 28
Could it be hacked? Obviously. No matter what you do, brainwallet or not, you could be hacked. But I am quite certain that this is as safe as anything else you can come up with.
