You could mine alt currency at a very slow rate and hope, I guess.

PayPal did this to me and froze a lot of money because of it. Amazon Payments will also shut down your processing, so be aware of that. As will Square. And many other payment gateways will not work with Bitcoin related companies.
I've gone through many.

It's the smallest dividable fraction of Bitcoin. Still pretty great, though.

Feel free to ask any questions here or PM me. It's geared towards those who do not want to deal with any equipment (or can't) and want to join in on the Bitcoin market.
I pay out share dividends in Bitcoin or USD, and aim to protect the privacy of my shareholders. If you want to be anonymous, you can join using Bitcoin and have only a wallet address as your identifying info (no name, email, etc.) for payouts.
I am also looking at other mining rigs and might move away from BFL if they continue their delays. Their customer service has been really good for me so far on my already placed orders. I aim to make the first shareholder payout in September.

I posted this before and received a lot of skepticism. I thought I'd reshare now that I've paid out a few dozen Bitcoin to the early investors.
On a side note, getting a credit card authorization portal linked to a website that deals with Bitcoin is pretty much impossible. I was really surprised.

I'll look into what they've been doing. Sounds like a good way of putting it together.
This is indeed the closest thing to what I meant. I like it. I put together a quick version of my own more e-commerce centric with no cap on the number of seats (I'm calling them shares and defining a share as a 1 Gh/s portion of the final operation) here:
Any thoughts?

I have invested a lot of my own money already. I'll already be managing quite a lot of BFL equipment when it comes in. I looked into venture capital and bank loans for doing larger orders, but honestly I like the idea of building a cooperative much more than running my own solo mining rig. It plays more to the backbone idea of Bitcoin and my personal philosophy (I've been a part of starting two flat organizations, one of which was non-profit). I don't consider the shares purchased as loans at all, more of a way of spreading Bitcoin through individual small investors and taking a lot of power away from the major individual miners. 
I understand that you wouldn't invest with someone you thought was bad at business. I've held director titles at three different organizations and C level titles at two, and I've been a founding member of three different start-ups. That doesn't prove I know what I'm doing, for sure, but it at least shows you I must be competent at something.
The plan is to take all the money from purchased shares and invest it in ASIC equipment. My cost on ASIC equipment will vary depending on the volume I can order, but we're basically looking at $65 per Gh/s, which means, after costs of doing business (hosting fees, transaction fees, etc) I'll basically be able to order 2 Gh/s for every share purchased. That leaves 1 Gh/s to cover operating and expansion costs per share sold, which is plenty.
I'll put together a blog post that answers these questions more directly, I think.

Security, efficiency, ease of use... online payments are a huge pain to deal with both as a merchant and as a customer, and Bitcoin does make it easier and will continue to improve. PayPal and Authorize.net own the vast majority of online transactions, and they skim a much higher percentage than they need to. PayPal also has a history of making remarkably evil business decisions with their merchants, seizing and holding funds with no recourse and without merit, honoring obviously fraudulent charge backs, and severing/black listing merchants for confusing reasons. It's a really terrible field to work with and Bitcoin is a very good way to circumvent many of the problems.

The fact that you think anyone can teach without studying it shows your ignorance. I would like to see your backing evidence for this. 
I don't believe you about the diversity of your home school. Please site figures for socio-economic and ethnic diversity in your classroom, as well as special needs students.

There's a difference between the consumption you refer to as "mania" and the good of consumption overall. Consumption is good, to a degree. It needs to be in balance, but without consumption we do not create revenue. Without revenue, we do not create anything else.
Do you have to throw "liberal" around as a bad word? I can do the same with Libertarians, Conservatives, you name it. Everyone has apparent hypocrisy in the surface of their beliefs.
Informed, measured consumption leads to controlled growth and the increasing of the standard of living, all other things held constant.

I'm not attempting to perpetrate a scam. All the correct paperwork has been filed and my real address and business phone number are available on the site. 
If there's something specific that makes this seem like a scam I'd appreciate details. I don't want it to come across that way. The upside for me is very clearly spelled out on the website. I'm not trying to trick anyone.

I am discounting the leases of whole machines heavily for Black Friday! I will also be awarding an additional lease for every five leases bought. For example, buy 5 Gh/s worth of Bitcoin leases and I'll give you the 6th for free!
Feel free to email me with questions! mike

That's a good idea. I'll get some pictures up of the current setup put up soon if I can get good ones. Proof of what's on order is a bit different. If you email me I can send you receipts from BFL.
It's very similar to dividend paying groups. Just the nomenclature is slightly different and the method of acquiring a share is slightly different.
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:52:15
At current difficulty rates and market price, yes, this would be the return. That is not a guarantee and I spell it out a few places on the website what the worst case and likely best case scenarios are.
I have invested a substantial amount of my own capital into the mining operation, and each share purchased will add to the mining operation's output. I addressed this concern in a blog post just now with much more detail about what is being acquired for each shareholder and what BitCoop gets out of it.
Basically, one share is 1 Gh/s of output, which I am selling at $150. I will be spending that $150 on approx. 2 Gh/s of output, with the excess used to cover operational expenses and expansion.
I'm using crowd sourcing instead of VC funding for the project because I believe it is more in line with the backing philosophy of Bitcoin and it definitely aligns with my personal philosophy on responsible business practices. If you have any questions please read the blog post:
And then email me/post here/post there/PM me/call me... whichever.

All of these students opted into achievement tests, and were from a startlingly narrow demographic. Apples to apples comparison, this is not. It's also not even an indicator of general home schooling effectiveness because of the opt in nature of the testing. There is no way to do a full general evaluation of home schooling because of the lack of any kind of requirement on the parents involved for any data metric. 
Edit: For fairness, this would need to control for demographic (socio economic, special needs, etc.) and do an apples to apples comparison. It's possible to do that with the data they have, at least to some degree, but it is not done in the study linked.
@_date: 2013-09-18 23:49:11
No, they wouldn't. Competent teaching takes a lot more than content knowledge. Nearly anyone could TUTOR that subject, and through one on one instruction eventually, maybe, help bring an average or better student to understand it, but to be a competent teacher takes much more. That's why it takes additional schooling to become one, additional credentialing, continuing education, and years of experience before you are competent enough to solidly teach a given subject.
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:24:34
Teacher here: The worst prepared student I ever had was a 16 year old home schooled freshman. The best home schooled kids I ever had were all about on par with the best public and private school kids. Home schooling works about as well as traditional schooling when done perfectly, and is orders of magnitude worse than the worst traditional schools when done badly.

Drop of Bitcoins? I don't know what that means. Is there a typo somewhere?
@_date: 2013-06-11 00:35:01
I agree, the market is changing, pretty rapidly. The cost of acquiring equipment remains similar, though.
I have put into the business plan the possibility of greater benefits from economies of scale (say, if 1000 shares are sold) to order much larger mining rigs, and thus drop the price per Gh significantly. If this happens, I will be increasing the value of each share in Ghs to match. In the end, I want to have twice the mining capacity than the number of shareholders would require, so if I end up with 3600 Gh/s and only 900 shares sold, I'll increase everyone's share worth to 2 Gh/s instead of 1. The excess goes to paying the operating costs and expansion.
This is essentially similar to any shared mining endeavor, of which there are several very successful ones, but the difference is in the management charge. I am not going to be taking 5% off the top for managing the operation. I take the operating profit at the point of initial sale and maintain the operation based on that investment. It's cheaper in the long run for shareholders and more beneficial in the initial phase to BitCoop.
I do have a bunch of BFL equipment on order, and I've been talking to KnCMiner and Cryonics and will have units on order from each (assuming I can verify a few things about their existence). The mining operation itself is approaching the terrahash rate. I do more specifically go into the possibility of changes in a few places on bitcoop.org, but I think I'll lay it out in a blog post as well.
I'm not mining Namecoin, I just DID mine Namecoin for about 10 minutes so it sticks there in the stats forever.
Does that answer some of your questions?
