Holy shit what is wrong with some of you people. You bash other coins like they are some sort of threat to bitcoin. Don't get me wrong I love bitcoin, but you should work to support other coins and respect them. Attacking other coins just makes you look like total assholes. 
Let dogecoin be dogecoin, let peercoin be peercoin, let whatevercoin be whatevercoin and stop being total assholes. 
As for op, I personally hold a small stake in both doge and btc, but a common word people use when talking about investing is diversification. Wishing you the best though.

You can use weselldoges.com, and then transfer the doge into bitcoin. You'll pay quite the premium though.

Because cryptocurrency as a whole is an AWESOME thing. New coins, can create innovation. The code for Bitcoin has changed a lot since it was first created, so new coins can create new ideas which Bitcoin can then build off of.  
I would also suggest refraining from calling someone an idiot for making a cryptocurrency, because you probably couldn't make one yourself.
