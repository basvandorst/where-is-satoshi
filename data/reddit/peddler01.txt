Yeah probably was a flub on Coinjar's end.  I have had that happen before with other sites then you have to contact support.  Its quite annoying.  This is why its better to hold your own private keys like in your mycelium wallet as much as possible.  Full control over your own funds.

Not sure how new you are, or if you would prefer not having to download the whole chain.  If you rather get set up quickly and easily you can try [electrum](  It is a light weight wallet where you don't have to download any of the blockchain at all.

2014 was a glorious year.  The amount of innovation, new users, and giant companies accepting Bitcoin was huge.  The amount of funding by VCs put into Bitcoin startups remains high if not higher than ever this year.
Calling Bitcoiners a cult and stuff and accusing them of faking stuff to get attention makes it seem like you are a buttcoiner troll from here to troll us.

Banks don't love me.  Actually I never fucked up.  They fucked up by charging me with bullshit on 15 year old savings accounts that have been empty for decades.  So I withdrew all of my money.  What is a bad idea, is allowing banks to rape you, so enjoy that.
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:08:19
Yeah I won't even go to a credit union, because they will rape your private data with KYC/AML laws, and file SARs on you for using your own money.

I think its because the inflation is so high right now.  In two years the inflation will be much lower.  After the halving it will be less than 5% monetary inflation per year.  The inflation is probably even much greater than 10% right now, because there seems to be many many coins that were lost or destroyed forever.  It doesn't make sense for them to pump the price yet.
Also VCs have already dumped $400 million into Bitcoin startups.  This is a huge number compared to Bitcoin's market cap of only $4.6 billion.  VCs also want some time for their startup companies to mature creating the infrastructure needed for prime time.  They don't want to start the next hype cycle until their companies are ready to handle the volume and have the tools in place to cater to mainstream users.

Hey man, my bank dicked me recently too.  If I were you, probably I would just refuse to pay it, and abandon my bank account. Actually I did that exact thing recently to Bank of America.  Im using Bitcoin and cash only from now on.  It feels good.
I have been trying to give away these 200 bits Please take them.

Not sure.  Was the transaction on blockchain.info but just unconfirmed this whole time?  If not, then perhaps its just coinjar's fault.  Sometimes exchanges run into problems, and withdrawals get delayed.
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:28:05
ok :)
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:20:59
Its still the distribution stage.  They don't want to pump the price too high yet because the inflation is 10% per year right now.  They want to keep the price low so they can slowly accumulate as much as possible before pumping the price to new highs in a year or two.

Governments don't provide needs to society, people and the freemarket are what provides for society.  Governments only suck off of the real producers like parasites and hinder the free market from providing society's needs.  Government has an interest in surpressing your needs, because as long as they keep you in need, it gives them a reason to pretend to exist.  You think government solves problems, so you will give them more money and power to solve problems that they create.  This incentivizes them to create even more problems, then when things are worse you will give them even more money and power, and its a vicious cycle.
Bitcoin doesn't require permission, so it allows us to bypass the government's restrictions on the free market.  This allows more freedom, wealth and prosperity.  Soon light bulbs will be illegal along with increasingly more things.  You won't be able to buy and sell them on ebay.  But on openbazaar, you can buy and sell anything for Bitcoin without permission.
Redistribution of wealth is a horrible idea, unless it is the free market that is redistributing it naturally.  Right now we have a lot of corporations and monopolies/oligopolies who stole their wealth through government scams.  They captured regulators through a process known as "regulatory capture", and that is where their wealth comes from.  Central banks are printing the money out of thin air distributing it not to you or the common man, but to corrupt bankers and monopoly men.  Bitcoin would allow freedom, and a transfer of wealth away from scammer monopoly men, towards the common man, and towards those who actually offer economic value.

Well I am not really sure about that.  I don't think its too risky to use a lightweight wallet. I don't really think it takes much longer to receive payments, maybe a few seconds? You can always check a blockexplorer like blockchain.info to verify you received the payment as well. 
But it is good to run a node, or even a full node as it helps contribute to the network and makes Bitcoin more secure.  If you want to run a true full node, you have to open port 8333 on your router, which will allow incoming connections, so you can get more than 8 active connections on your Bitcoin Core wallet.

They could change the code to make more Bitcoins in the future as well, as long as miner's and the network agree to accept the changes.  The only difference is its easier for a centrally controlled company to arbitrarily make more.
People can make more of many types of goods, like cars, paintings, statues.  Are those goods also not rivalrous or excludable?  Are those goods not private goods?  You just dont want to pay me my 1 BTC :P

My question is how is a scam fiat system, with QE money printing, with giant too-big-to-fail banker bailouts legal?
Bitcoin is decentralized, so it can't be shut down.  Soon they will tell everybody its illegal though.
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:45:05
Trezor is probably the best.  Ledger wallet may be a cheaper alternative, but possibly not quite as secure.
Electrum version 2.0 will be released soon with Trezor support

How come no mention that they can pay for subscripton of Time magazine?  Only the smaller ones?
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:09:58
Paintings can't be viewed by anybody if its in my basement. It can only be viewed by me or who I want to view it.  Otherwise you can pick a different example, like socks. Also anyone can view Bitcoin's on a blockchain, does this make it not a private good similar to paintings?
I think its useless really think of such definitions anyways.  The world is not government by simple definitions, but is rather much more complex, of which Bitcoin is a good example.

How long has shadowcash been around?  What is their coin distribution schedule?  Do you think that this news will cause the price of shadowcash to increase?
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:28:45
Get a wallet where you control your own private keys like [electrum]( wallet for a PC. Its good because you don't have to download the whole blockchain which can take like 3 days.  Just write down the 12 word seed when creating the wallet as your one time backup.  Or if you have a smart phone try out bread wallet for i-phone, or mycelium wallet for android.
Also try out changetip, just link your reddit account automatically, no e-mail or anything needed.

Excellent speech by a man that really gets it.  Too bad we don't have more Milton Friedmans in the world today.
Here are some other gems that people should watch:
He also predicted Bitcoin in 1999:

Ok, what about World of Warcraft gold, or swords traded for real money in MMORPG games?  Weren't those private goods as well that existed before Bitcoin?  Can I has 1 BTC now? :)

Cool, sounds really important and awesome.  People who say its only for criminals really should have their head examined.
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:24:54
Looks like its confirmed now: 
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:39:30
I am just barely grasping the concept of zero knowledge transactions, but it does sound important.  I have not yet played around with stealth addresses like with dark wallet yet, but is this similar to stealth addresses, or a different concept altogether?
