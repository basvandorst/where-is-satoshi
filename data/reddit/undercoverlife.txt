NO WAY.

I’m calling it’ll drop to mid 8ks, lowest will be high 7ks. I don’t think it’ll bull.
@_date: 2019-10-06 07:34:07
I agree. I cancelled that person's downvote.

It’s testing its supports right now. As you can see, the price is consolidating. And once it’s done, it’ll either skyrocket or plummet, one or the other. ANYONE telling you they know what will happen within the next few months is lying. We have no idea how a recession will affect Bitcoin. The price dipping or jumping can be argued both ways.

Halvenings do not technically spike BTC price: investors have always just happened to be optimistic after each halvening. You can call Ethereum’s behavior different, sure, but ETH just had their halvening in August and the price crashed.

You are out of your mind if you think 250K is within a couple of years.

You can assume whatever you want about me but I have a stellar education in economics, but that's completely irrelevant and you're just looking to up yourself.
Can you read? Did I say that a halvening has "no meaningful impact on price"? All I said is that it does not guarantee a skyrocket. You can't read.
And reread this sentence of yours?


**What the HELL is negative compensation?** What does this sentence even mean? You're trying to berate my intelligence and you spit this out at me? Painfully obvious that you're merely stringing big words together. You're the one who doesn't have a clue on this matter. You're projecting your ignorance onto me in an attempt to level yourself. What a JOKE.

I don’t know what to say to that. I don’t know much about ETH.

Bitcoin holders who have an adequate amount of BTC to liquidate for expenses when income is low.
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:55:32
And dude a halvening is not a "supply shock" for normal consumers like you and I, it's just a smaller reward for miners... again, your ignorance (and arrogance) is incredibly obvious when you say words like "supply shock", like come on. You're only fooling people who are new to Bitcoin with that rhetoric.
@_date: 2019-09-18 00:02:34
A halvening isn't a supply shock: a halvening only affects mining rewards. It doesn't affect the circulation of supply at all. You're spreading misinformation like it's funny.
"For everyone else watching" you're just clowning for other people's attention... I knew I shouldn't take a redditor who participates in r/The_Donald seriously.

That's awesome. I have no idea how I didn't stumble upon this. Thanks again!

They are still down, but there are still some stores that have already been transitioned, and they appear on the LibertyX app.
@_date: 2016-05-31 03:46:21
Is it that simple? I downloaded the app and it looks really easy! Thanks for the recommendation.

"a countries economy and currency were just seen relative to other countries"
"The US dollar seems strong but thats because everything else is just relatively beyond weak"
Here come the downvotes but I think you're kind of misinformed. The U.S. Dollar was established as the overarching mode of all international transactions after the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. Because of this move, the U.S. Dollar has way more worth than any other currency in the world (aside other reserve currencies, like the Yen) because it has more inherent worth as a token for international transactions, which can make a lot of Foreign Direct Investments possible. That doesn't mean that every nation's economy is entirely dependent (or relative) on one another, like you claimed. However, other nations do rely on other nations' economies simply because of trade deals and other logistics, so you're correct to some extent.  Nonetheless, this fact doesn't validate that "everything else (other currencies) is just relatively beyond weak."
Moreover, from what I've seen from my personal ventures of trading Bitcoin, it's apparent that Bitcoin isn't strong enough to sustain itself as its own currency. It's a bubble. It's been a bubble for quite sometime now. It fluctuates like crazy. Just because Bitcoin is established as a separate monetary system on the internet doesn't mean it has the power serve as an entirely new economy for supranational entities. There's simply not enough evidence to prove that a decentralized currency - one that no banks do business with - can provide a superpower like the United States with an entirely new economy: the United States does not regulate Bitcoin transactions at all. Can an economy exist without durative growth? That's only possible when strong institutions (like banks and the government) can lend and save that currency for profit - processes like these are not sustainable without regulation, which is the exact opposite purpose of Bitcoin's existence.
I do like this point you make, however: "Think of the internet as a new country with its own currency and it is growing like a free trade zone inside every country simutaneously". It makes me question, to what extent can governments regulate the internet? If we actually were to leave the internet open as a free, uninhibited sector of finance and information, Bitcoin could potentially establish itself as the internet's currency. Still, can Bitcoin invoke a dual economy for countries today? I don't believe so. Too many countries are banning it, plus it cannot be lent or traced by a country's government, which is a big no no for superpowers like China and the United States.

I feel you just threw the name Keynes out there for no reason, has little to do what wookiesvendtta said?
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:04:01
EXACTLY. I don't understand why people think Bitcoin can ever create a dual-economy scenario for any superpower today: it cannot be lent, traced or regulated.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:11:04
This doesn't make any sense.
