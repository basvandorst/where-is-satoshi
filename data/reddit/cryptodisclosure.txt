Any reputable online wallet will work just fine.  Also keeping it on your physical wallet is cool, too.  Either way. :D

My analysis puts it at 8,800 by end of year.  We'll see!

Ah dude.. i wrote an article about the first bitcoin transaction.  an 18yr old kid took 10k bitcoin in exchange for ordering the seller 2 pizzas.  Today that kid is 26 and has nothing.. imagine the regret. :I

Okay so kind of weird.  Had a vivid dream last night.  It was me like 20 years from now in a suit super fancy house party.  I was talking to someone else, telling them about the owner of the home and saying in exacerbation "He owns an ENTIRE BITCOIN".  Fn weird, I know.. but I think there's that kind of potential.

Lol, an oldie but a goodie, for those who missed.

Exactly why there's so much illogical criticism.  It's because they are Kmart and Bitcoin is Amazon.

Bitcoin is great as a speculative investment and maybe for larger xfers.  For the daily coffee? I'd say ripple is more practical.  Even Tether was supposed to mirror the USD - but does Tether adjust as the dollar would?
