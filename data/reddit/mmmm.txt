their pilot is acceptance of bitcoin payments through their liqpay arm. 
further on, they have plans to trade it just like any other foreign currency. like any exchange which does it now. protocol has nothing to do with that.

a few key facts from it:
- bitcoin lab in privatbank is active and working
- bitcoin is accepted via liqpay, which is their subsidiary, at 10000 PoS points around Ukraine. 
- they understand that they don't give best exchange rate now due to outsourced exchange operations, but if people use it, they hinted that they will probably run their own.

@_date: 2014-04-02 20:02:36
the reality is, i couldn't care less about academic definitions. i know perfectly well that falling prices are connected to scarce supply of a currency in which these prices are reflected, and the opposite is also true. now you're watching prices on goods denominated in bitcoins going up. same with gold. it doesn't go into what some folks are calling deflationary spiral, plain and simple :)
@_date: 2014-01-05 11:47:29
if you can't come up with applications which would be better with bitcoin, it's the lack of creativity. i'd rather take my bitcoins to car dealer, because it involves a lot of hassle with domestic wire and payment lookup where i live. or if i can leave a table in a restaurant earlier, i'd definitely prefer it. we're in the early stages of integration, so i think much more applications will pop up.

most folks here suggest returning USDs and i would agree.

@_date: 2014-04-02 20:14:04
so there's no currency which is always inflationary or deflationary. no point in initial question, right? no hoarding will hurt us. hoarding leads to price decrease, then weak hands are getting rid of currency, strong hands are picking, giving more value, price increases, leads to more hoarding.... rinse repeat.

i think from all that rumors we can get to the conclusion: China will let bitcoin live and not try to fight it if it is relatively small. they don't want to ban it unless other countries ban it, but they don't want it to take over their economy. a cautious wait and see approach.

i've said it a few times here, i'll say it once more. feel free to correct me if you're aware of the situation. 
- RCB never told directly and explicitly that Bitcoin is a money surrogate. 
- now, an assumption, even if they had told us so: the chapter which they refer to says that "issuing surrogates in Russian Federation" is illegal, but it doesn't say a word about using such "surrogates". moreover, they never define what's "issuing". was Satoshi "issuing" a "surrogate"? are miners doing it? it remains a mystery yet to be solved. 
- the tonality of said chapter is more like "only Russian Rouble should be used as legal tender, you can't make a legal tender of your own". 
the rest is mumbo jumbo on terrorism and laundering, which is still there anyway.

"потенциальная вовлеченность в осуществление сомнительных операций в соответствии с законодательством о противодействии легализации (отмыванию) доходов, полученных преступным путем, и финансированию терроризма"

@_date: 2016-01-15 08:16:39
i agree. 
instead of doing alt implementations, introducing endless BIPs on that and such, core devs should get their shit together, make consensus, increase the block size and stop trying to shift responsibility to miners, china or the moon. 
if not, they all must go.

i don't believe that will happen. many bitcoiners supported Trump. Trump voter and average bitcoiner have so much in common. 
take a look:
The 'average Bitcoin user' is male (96%), 32.7 years old, libertarian / anarcho-capitalist (37%), non-religious (61%), with a full time job (43%), and is in a relationship (56%). 
The study found Trump supporters are more likely to be male, blue-collar workers with lower levels of education. But one thing they aren't is poor. Instead, they "earn relative high household incomes."

Law360, New York (April 21, 2015, 2:12 PM ET) -- New York’s top financial regulator on Tuesday said his agency will release a final version of its licensing regime for Bitcoin and other virtual currency businesses in the coming weeks, and opened the door to potential changes if other states come up with radically different rules.
New York Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin M. Lawsky
New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin M. Lawsky said that the final BitLicense would be release by the end of May “at the latest.”
While New York is poised to be the first state regulator to release virtual currency licensing rules, it will not be the last. Lawsky said that the New York Department of Financial Services had been in close contact with other states, including California, that are looking to develop their own licensing regime for virtual currency businesses through its membership on a Conference of State Bank Supervisors panel on the issue and other contacts.
Although there is room for other states to have different regulations for virtual currency firms, there is a need for at least some consistency, Lawsky said.
“We’re going to see how this all shakes out. I think there’s room for federalism, but at the same time if you have a whole series of different rules and it becomes a crazy quilt patchwork, that can get hard to comply with,” Lawsky said on the sidelines of an event hosted by Dow Jones.
“We’ll have to see what other states do and other countries do, and if things don’t make sense we will take the next step,” he added.
The BitLicense, which Lawsky and the DFS unveiled in July, would for the first time subject Bitcoin businesses to anti-money laundering, consumer protection and cyber security standards that have become commonplace in the more traditional financial services sector.
However, Lawsky has repeatedly stated that he does not want the licensing regime to be so stringent as to hamper innovation in the digital currency space.
The latest version of the New York Department of Financial Services’ BitLicense proposal, released in February in response to around 7,000 comments on the original proposal, includes a two-year conditional BitLicense for small startup firms that want to operate Bitcoin businesses in New York.
The two-year transitional BitLicense will be available to startups and small businesses that are unable to meet the high regulatory bar set by the DFS.
The BitLicense proposal also includes a requirement that firms report suspicious transactions to the DFS. Typically such reporting is done to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a unit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
Advocates for virtual currencies have bristled at the state-level AML reporting requirement, however.
There have also been calls for additional safe harbors to be included in the rule.
New York’s BitLicense revised proposal did make some changes that were welcomed by the virtual currency world.
As an example, the proposal eliminates previous language requiring any firm operating with a BitLicense to obtain the addresses and transaction data for all parties to a virtual currency transaction.
Instead, firms will only have to get that information for their own customers and, where they can, the counterparties to a transaction.
Technology firms and other companies that are using virtual currencies for nonfinancial purposes, including the miners that use high-powered computers to mine for Bitcoin, will also not have to register for a BitLicense under the revised proposal.

it's all about balancing act... convenience and probability of compromise. i consider myself an advanced user of crypto applications (i know concepts behind RNG, entropy, sha-256 and elliptic curve). it's rather hard to concentrate and invent a good brainwallet passphrase to remember while shelling goes on nearby. so i figured a cloud storage (which i consider to be semi-private, since it stores data server-side) and a wallet file encryption with good passphrase in a secure environment would do the trick for me.

are you serious? try telling that to Russia or Saudi Arabia where 50 to 80% of their currency backing is oil. guess what pays for their groceries. try telling that to yourself every time you drive to the gas station. 
turns out it's just more convenient to drive a car than to drive a bicycle. that's why folks are forking their precious dollars and euros and whatelse for oil. bitcoin should become just like that, more convenient, more useful than your paper cash. then your perception of units of account will change.

also, an important point. if it works good for the bank, they will see value in it. meaning they could use bitcoin's strong points (sending value fast, at low fee, instantly, across distributed network) and use it with their capital for their purposes, bringing additional liquidity. 
theoretically, if many banks have access to exchanges and exchange rates are good, they can eventually divert from SWIFT/NACHA to favor of bitcoin. 
so, it's actually a win-win solution. instead of messing with "verification queue" and "wire to Shibuya, Japan", do it right. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:43:52
only because it's tangible. be it in cash, they'd take it no matter what. if it's offshore account, that would be next to impossible for them. confiscating bitcoins - well, it's like a space flight to jupiter for them, their tech skills are usually lacking. but the most important thing is, if we had complex regulations in place almost prohibiting companies from selling it for dollars and gov would try to pull just that - they'd be grilled.

i think bitcoin can accommodate both types of people, just like cash or any other form of money. both good guys and bad guys can hold cash or a bank account. it's not what it makes them good or bad. time for people to realize, it can be anonymous for some AND mainstream for the others at the same time. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:45:17
it is unusable for far more reasons than that. you can't afford to have 20% price swings during the day. it makes you a currency trader and not a mom-and-pop merchant. it puts your customers in the same pit, instantly. please realize that. 
it's a great playground for a trader since it's unregulated and lots of folks sit here with their money, "because 10% up a day". with some technical charting and proper limit orders on major exchange or two, knowledge of fundamentals (like mtgox queue/news tonality) it's a quick money to be made.

well, try to analyze the risks. I don't know the US regulations particularly good enough to give advise, but perhaps it's worth asking fincen directly how to keep everything in line? at least if you have their approval, it is something to show other regulatory bodies. perhaps do case studies of coinbase, coinlab/svb? i do understand that pioneering in this area brings risk, but risk also means profit?

money created on demand is purely keynesian approach. it is exactly what we have now. when in trouble, dollar liquidity is injected into economy. government tries to regulate which economy areas have more money. 
bitcoin comes from the opposite side, scarcity. everyone is fighting for that holy bitcoin. miners are kings. 
there's also planned economy method, it's when central authority regulates everything, including price fixing. this is socialism approach, and one can argue that it's keynesian on steroids, given the government's even bigger role (i do realize that this one is subjective). 
which one do you suggest?

the only concept i like so far is proof-of-stake. if we can take it to instant transactions and non-miners blocks, i tend to think it would be beneficial for the network. until then, all altcoins look like junk to me. 
rate of adoption is another reason i don't like altcoins. there is a number of metals which are more scarce than gold, and they don't have instantly recognizable trade value, or maybe no trade value at all (limited market liquidity etc).

FBI (and US gov) is the world's largest owner and operator of bitcoins at the moment. mind you, bitcoin is an item no financial institution in the US wants to touch. if they auction it and accept wire transfer for it, what bank will they use? how is it different from coinbase or whatever other exchange is? are they operating above the law? this whole deal raises whopping lot of questions, tough ones.

perhaps this paves the way to faster bank transfers worldwide. perhaps not. btw, would be interesting to see what the transfer fees are when said fees represent substantial amount of miners revenue. currently, they're about 1% of their income, what would happen later, noone knows. really, a complexity of bitcoin is underestimated.

i think fear of deflation is only relevant with government-issued money and not with an alternative currency system like bitcoin. too much hoarding will result in decreased spending of bitcoins and at the same time increased use of fiat. markets will react to that and value of bitcoin drops, so hoarding is probably a wrong strategy in the long run.

these risks can be mitigated by authority of miner and clear rules of initial coins distribution. ripple lacks the second part. when community sees that first miner isn't interested in holding/profiting from holding, they can increase in value. 
bitcoins didn't cost anything too, it's the market which lifted up the value. 
fourth reason touches inflation vs deflation argument, and it's too complex to begin with. interest to this hypothetical system can be spurred by advantages over bitcoin. maybe pre-mined holder could offer some incentives for exchanges too, like cheaper supply. 
startup idea for this system should be to distribute these units for cheap to persons who're going to be useful for network.

i don't really care about downvoting, i also see value in bitcoin as it is promising platform for fast/inexpensive transactions. but i don't see any investment in it, at least, so far, when adoption rate is so low and no institutional players are considering it. besides, markets cannot go up in geometrical progression forever, sometimes it just stops. i wish that bitcoin was more liquid and less volatile. now it reminds me an iphone rush all over again, really.

i understand your points, they're very reasonable. 
it's up to the US if they will introduce bitcoin to their banking system with reasonable regulations (currently, i don't think it's reasonable, since many businesses are getting out of it). 
if they do, it will skyrocket. 
if they don't, it would operate to the likes of hawala. no matter how you fight it, it has it's usages and it's users.

i think that we still have centralized system. shut down 5 biggest exchanges and bitcoin might not survive it. shut down 5 biggest pool operators and it may well die with a big difficulty and only a handful of miners. yes, cash flows and miners might be able to regroup somehow, but chances of that look slim to me.

because it's not backed up with much real services where you can spend it. current merchants and useful services are all drop in the bucket. you know, when one guy 20000 miles away bought a coffee with it, it's not much. now crowd buys into btcs, when it realizes it can't do much with it and goes in the opposite direction, exchange rate would crash just as fast as it grows.

if coinlab had any serious plans, why not make it in their own? study mt gox weak points and start a whole new exchange? why this partnership, just to have bitcoin liquidity? sign up a few major vendors to accept btcs and you're done. have good funding methods and you'll have dollar liquidity.

unfortunately you do, although in non-direct way. bitcoins that you hold are backed by fiat mostly because mtgox is holding it (as in full-reserve banking). recent crash is a direct consequence of a lawsuit, if mtgox disappears with money (fiat ones), bitcoins can be worthless, either for a long time or forever if confidence is damaged permanently.

i don't know much about B, I or C, but i do know a thing or two about R. average people buy US dollars (and, more recently, euros) as an asset to local currency inflation. so, it's not even gold. less during few past years, but still, many people save in bucks. i don't see how people would go into bitcoin, given that buying and selling choices remain rather limited (and one can exchange rubles for USD almost everywhere). if bitcoin circulates more freely, well, there's a chance, overall internet adoption rate is pretty good and climbing. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:15:27
you're talking about the near-term situation, while the discussion is how viable bitcoins as an alternative to fiat money. near term should be very dependent on services, exchanges and merchants willing to accept bitcoins, also, user experience of mentioned services.

with bitcoin, you are free to choose a different jurisdiction, other than the US and it's SEC. your US bitcoins will be perfectly good in china or japan if you're worried about regulation. i don't really see it as a problem, unless it's completely prohibited. i think the US government don't want to fall behind in bitcoin race, probably seeing it as innovative and valid payment/investment vehicle.

if sufficient number of pools is taken out, block generation would be so slow that network will remain barely usable for a prolonged period of time until difficulty adjusts. after it does, network might be susceptible for more attacks, due to lower difficulty.

i don't know, but now it looks obvious to me. what we have is $180M invested in 45 terrahashes, and their current hashing power costs a fraction of that to produce. now, consider kncminer. 
asicminer's hashing power is like 100 jupiters. so it comes out at $700k, and kncminer sells it at premium, i believe. 
if asicminer owns more than 50% of network (now it has 25%), value of bitcoin would crash for obvious reasons, whole network becomes centralized. most likely, market would realize it and crash their stock instead. 
so their "real" value is at $1.5M, at best. ;)

i want to raise one topic... why pre-mined is so bad in public's eyes, if supply can be fixed? eventually money would change hands, especially if initial miner isn't going to focus on profit.

24/07/2013 Additional Clarification on current withdrawls from MtGox
International Transfers - Right now larger **transfers of 5 digits or more are receiving priority over smaller transfers**. Should you have multiple withdrawls underway, the value of these are added together and considered for this transfer priority.
SEPA Transfers - There are no official delays on SEPA transfers but, due to banking limits, **larger transfers may still experience delays**.
they're giving contradicting messages, i would only believe money at this point. i don't have any funds stuck in mtgox, if i had i'd buy bitcoins there and cashed out somewhere else.

biggest US terrorists in history were funded in US banks with US dollars, all under US government compliance and supervision. it's a fact documented by US investigation body. 
The best available evidence indicates that approximately $300,000 was deposited into the hijackers’ bank accounts in the United States by a variety of means. Just prior to the flights, the hijackers returned about $26,000 to one of their al Qaeda facilitators and attempted to return another $10,000, which was intercepted by the FBI after 9/11. Their primary expenses consisted of tuition for flight training, living expenses (room, board and meals, vehicles, insurance, etc.), and travel (for casing flights, meetings, and the September 11 flights themselves). The FBI believes that the funds in the bank accounts held by the hijackers were sufficient to cover their expenses. The FBI, therefore, believes it has identified all sources of funding. Our investigation has revealed nothing to suggest the contrary, although it is possible that the $300,000 estimate omits some cash that the hijackers brought into the United States and spent without depositing into a bank account or otherwise creating a record.

so you're taking down your order book claim, aren't you? they buy and sell and resort to a bigger exchange, mt gox, when they're unable to strike balance between two. so they can be considered a marketplace and not really an intermediary. by the way, your definition from that online dictionary lacks "currencies" :)

your long term focus should be to set up a local bitcoin exchange. back it with some cash and some bitcoins. maybe a person-to-person style of exchange like those listed at localbitcoins.com. start from informational/educational site regarding bitcoin in greek and work from there. good luck.

random thoughts: 
with bitcoin you can choose what's secure with your amount of money. in current system, FI chooses for you and sets limits on what you can do and cannot. i don't want a pre-set limit, i want to set limit myself. 
three factor is easily achievable with bitcoin. make a BIP38 wallet with your fingerprint or some other biometric and a passphrase and it would be that. 
why do you think we need to use bitcoin debit card? try thinking out of the box. we probably need secure smartphone apps much more than that. 
current system makes data protection unnecessary and users are not encouraged to maintain privacy of their data. bitcoin is exactly otherwise.

they didn't comment on libertyreserve and egold for years, they happily existed, then one day boom, and crackdown. cyprus, deposits are in the banks, the other day, a haircut. i can go on and on, but if a government decides that it's short of cash, they will take it from you, no matter what. this is how they operate, they change rules overnight. no FUD, but facts. a good lobbying can only slow it down somehow, better than nothing, still not enough. 
i say decentralize exchanges. ideally, same pool of liquidity, many operators from all over the world. be it through ripple, opentransactions or god knows what else.

i carefully thought on more or less the same issue, of everyone hoarding the btc (aka deflationary spiral).

from the article. i don't understand one common thing about bitcoin teller machines. wouldn't it be more appropriate to code interface into a mobile/website app, since everyone is already using smartphone or a computer, and leave only dispenser/cash register for the actual ATM? 
it could work like this - you send your bitcoin online to the company which owns atm, they acknowledge it (again online), you get your cash from the machine with one-time code (qr or whatever)? 
even more secure and cheaper for the end-unit, no?

if they start straight from asking for collateral and subpoena every (relatively) big bitcoin business in their area, does that look like an act of friendliness to you? did they even outline their consumer protection mechanisms that they might employ for bitcoin, or did they just ask for money and control upfront? 
call me crazy or an extremely risky guy, but i have a total of 10% of my cash assets sitting in bitcoins. i diversify, that's how i try to mitigate risks. 
i do see bitcoin ETF boosting value, that's obvious to me, but there is no need (as per my opinion) for SEC regulation of bitcoins. SEC doesn't regulate emerging markets, for example, and there's an ETF for that. they might be regulating ETFs, but not the underlying markets. 
why would i want government involvement and how it's going to boost value? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:04:32
my view is: 
current rate of climb only supported by more people buying in (these are plentiful) and not by actual useful services/products offered (these are still scarce). once we lose media focus, rate climb would stop, most likely reverse. 
but it's only through up and down rate swings the whole idea of bitcoins will prove viability. it survived first major crash in 2011, if it can survive second, third etc subsequent crashes, it would be good enough for more people to consider.
