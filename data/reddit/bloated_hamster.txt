Verge is a joke. It's down to 8 cents after a price pump to 24 cents. Seems like pump and dump scam to me. I kept telling my Dad not to buy it but he's into alts, luckily I convinced him to sell at 11 cents after he bought at 16 and minimized his losses.

You asked how all cryptos would not be legal if bitcoin was accepted as legal tender. The Us government recognized the US dollar as legitimate currency. It did not recognize monopoly money just because it is  made of the same (or rather similar, as paper money is closer to cloth than paper) material as the us dollar. In the same vein, the us would not have to recognize all cryptos as legal tender if they recognize bitcoin. This is because while bitcoin and for example bcash are made of the same "ones and zeros," they are not the same, just like how monopoly money, though similar to paper money, is not a recognized currency. Just because one crypto is legal does not mean all cryptos must be legal.

In the same way declaring paper US dollars legal tender doesn't make monopoly money legal tender. It would open the door to the possibility of other cryptos becoming legal tender but has no bearing on the status of other coins just because they are made with the same medium.

BCash is even worse. If you even mention Roger Ver getting arrested on the other subreddit you get bombarded by comments about how it was setup by the government to take down libertarians and how we need to get rid of the Us dollar and make Bcash the money everyone uses after we put ver and ron paul's faces on each side of the bcash logo.

Bcash isn't like improving your engine instead of getting a rocket. It's like putting a second engine in your trunk instead of improving the one engine you have now. And then when you need your car to go faster bcash will just stick another engine in the back seat. It works in the short term but eventually you get overwhelmed by the size and number of engines you have.

Ignore that guy. Bitcoin cash is a fake, wanna be bitcoin. He's basically lying to you. Don't sell what you bought, you'll just get kicked in the balls by fees. You're alright, you should just research more. BTc is the real bitcoin, bitcoin cash is what's called a "fork" where a bunch of people tried to make a replacement bitcoin to get rich. It failed. Comparing the price of one bitcoin which is at $6600 currently and one bitcoin cash which is $500 and you can see which ine is more valuable. There are a lot of people who will lye to you. Please research the difference between bitcoin and the different forked amd alt coins.

So what would be left to discuss? Technology advances happen only every once in a while and you only need one post about each one. So will this sub consist of three posts?

Isn't the whole idea of bitcoin that it will be adopted into main stream use in the future, that'll never happen if people refuse to answer questions and instead just tell people they shouldn't have bitcoin.

Bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, et all have all lived in harmony. When Bcash came along, with the intention to, as one of the Bcash devs put it, "send Bitcoin into a death-spiral." We have never had any problems with alts until Bcash came along trying to make Ver and Jihan richer.

It keeps going up because people are buying in as new ways to use bitcoin are developed. Eventually the price will settle as it becomes easy and cheap to use and people stop speculating with it. There isn't the technology yet to cheaply and easily use bitcoin in your every day life, which means right now it is worth more as a speculation than a currency. But once the technology makes it a viable day to day currency it will settle and be usable without loss.

Wait to transfer it. With that small an investment the security of where it is will be fine. Once the backlog on the chain clears in a few days the fees should go down. So just wait until things return to normal and then transfer it to your long term wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:52:26
For the people forking? Usually to get rich. But the idea is that a fork involves changing the rules of bitcoin. If everyone agrees it is called a soft fork and everyone just starts to use the new rules. But when there is disagreement on what should happen, the group that advocates the change will "fork off" the core chain of "Bitcoin" and continue the chain with their own rules. Thus, there will be two chains with different rules. Segwit 2x is this second chain. It has happened a few times in the past with bitcoin gold and bitcoin cash, but they pretty much universally fail to really even compete with bitcoin.

I first heard about Bitcoin 4 years ago when it was still ~$200. I really wanted to buy some but I was a broke high school freshman. I could have bought a new car now if I had invested the $500 I wanted to put in at the time. Just got interested in Bitcoin again a few weeks ago and i'm gonna buy while we are still sub $4000.

We aren't the PR department for bitcoin. Noone here is out to impress you or cater to your needs. If you find these communities bad and you think other people do to, start an r/bitcoinsafespace or something. You act like we need you to join our community. We're just a bunch of people who like bitcoin, shitty memes and reveling in our profits (and mourning out losses) together. We also hate people who scam and spread false info so when shitty subreddits do that we're gonna call them out. So either join the shitposting or go start your own sub, but no one's gonna cry is you leave.
