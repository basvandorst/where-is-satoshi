I try, selling signed copies of my books for bitcoin (and other crypto's and cash).  11 bucks cdn plus shipping (here:  ), the problem  is there isn't a huge crossover between Indie fiction readers and bitcoin users.  Would be nice but I'm stuck buying (for now).

I might try that. Thanks

If a solar flare large enough to take down the internet happened bitcoin would be useless, but so would the stock market,  your bank account and the government.  At that point you will be more worried about food, water and shelter, bitcoin will be the least of your worries.
If you're genuinely worried about scenarios such as super massive solar flares I would invest in lead.

Just happens, this is a bitcoin sub so naturally people will gravitate more toward bitcoin not the alternatives.

Running a node has no reward. The "reward" is the fact that it helps the network and if you actually own any coins you need that network.

Easiest way, sell it to someone directly (even though that might not be easy as finding a buyer could be hard).  Other than that I think there is a market but the name escapes me.

For the pay what you want ebook versions.

This is what I was looking for, thank you.  I feel you provide an honest answer as to why people (like yourself) hate bitcoiners.  I misunderstood where the hate was placed, hating a currency makes no sense, it's inanimate, hating the people that use and push that currency makes more sense.
I haven't been areound this sub all that long, I check in from time to time and was curious as to why there was so much conflict and I think you summerized it well.  I agree with some of your points of contention, the buy and hold idea doesn't make sense to me either, if it's a currency it's supposed to be used, if everyone holds then there can be no value.
With out getting side tracked though I think you describe it well and helped me understand where the dislike comes from, thank you.

Lot of those seem related to evolution and other dark net markets scamming people but I'll keep browsing.

I honestly feel that you have a greater chance of loosing them to human error then to a hack

I see you got a lot flak for your point but thanks for being honest. I have to agree with you about people pushing it on others that don't fully understand it.  I wouldn't compare it to a penny stock but your point is valid (I'm not a fan of any one pushing investment asvice though I'm more a fan of telling people and letting them learn and decide on their own). Thanks for the insight though

No problem, hope you like it.

So it's possible but only by keylogging or through team viewer. Basically the same way credit card info would be stolen.

Oh neat 
@_date: 2015-02-28 16:02:17
Cool, thanks.  I know nothing is 100% safe (banks included) but getting as close to 100% safe as possible is the goal.

Donating / tipping is easier, quicker to impliment and more goes to the artist.  I tried the same with paypal and when all is said and done the most that goes to the artist is 90%.  This is more direct.  I know it's not the most unique thing but I think it offers an interesting option for artists.

  seems simple enough with just basic account making (email, user name).  I've never used it though, being Canadian I use quickbt but not sure that works in the states.
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:08:58
Woo for the set.
@_date: 2015-02-28 16:01:14
That's what I was thinking, multiple copies so if something happened there would be back up's.  Thanks
