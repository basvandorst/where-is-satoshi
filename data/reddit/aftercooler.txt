Your insight is impeccable.

Thank you for the suggestions! From one multi-planetary being to another, I look forward to toasting you in zero gravity!

As a few posters have stated, Lightning will enable a node(hop) to specify the fees for transferring funds to the next hop along a senders route. Another cool ability will be for wallet implementations more widely supporting routing protocols such as SPHINX to clearly display the fees of various routes, and enable by default to select the least expensive route.

The only disadvantage to speak of here is due to the patenting of this, and the resulting non-open use of that patent at this time. Were it to be opened to all, the protocol could be left as is, and all hardware makers could use it if they wanted to further optimize. 
There is an argument that by putting the prevention of this in at the protocol level, it increases complexity at the protocol level, because now it has to do additional verifications that ensure ASICBOOST is not being used, which in theory could be pushed out to the edges (the miners) by requiring them to add it to their next chip tapeout.

Clearly you missed the point, because banks don't need legal precedent today to block transfers from bitcoin exchanges, which is exactly why they are suing Wells.  As banks, they have guidelines for how to treat MSB's, and rather than identifying whether or not a bitcoin business operating as an MSB is following the same standard of regulatory KYC/AML policy and procedures as non-bitcoin MSB's, the banks instead simply deny services, or create hold-ups.  These businesses rely on banks for traders that want to trade fiat, and not just crypto.

This case could provide a catalyst to transform the way corresponding banks handle MSB's involved in using bitcoin.

As I mentioned, the only major disadvantage stems from the closed patent, not being available to all. My phrasing around the additional argument could have been better, as I don't believe that argument either re complexity/verification to be correct, it was an argument I've read and was trying to use it for contrast but failed to preface things better - you are correct, that is not how it works.

You explained the technical details, that is a generosity that extends being plain niceties.  His response did not address the issue, and instead insulted you, questioned your motives, and attempted to divert the entire conversation towards it being a competition of performance between Xthin and CB, rather than addressing the actual bug raised. His response would have been better for a blog post, after he deactivated his buggy code, fixed it, re-implemented it, and then showed the performance vs CB. He failed to do any of those things, due to his ego being bruised.

Yes, this should be possible, if implemented correctly.  In the case of Liquid by Blockstream, a pegout amount can differ from a pegin amount. Mainchain txFees must be accounted for, of course.

Hi OP,
Here's a made-up example scenario (below) of how you might utilize a combination of techniques such as BIP-38 Encrypted Paper Wallets to generate an encrypted private key, and to then split that key using Shamir. This would provide you with additive security (assuming you can remember your password). You could also combine the two methods even further, by splitting the password used to BIP-38 Encrypt, and providing those parts to different parties.
Alice has 3 brothers, Bob, Tom, and John.
Alice BIP-38 encrypts her a new wallet using the passphrase 'this is my favorite password'
Example: 
Alice uses SSSS to split her password 4 parts, with a 3 of 4 threshold, and gives each brother one part, and keeps one to herself (in-case she forgets and only needs two of them to reconstruct it).
Alice then splits her encrypted private key into 5-parts, with a 4 of 5 threshold. She provides one part to each brother, keeps one part, and places the other into her family trust, to be presented to the other brothers upon her death. Alice also keeps 3 of these parts, hidden in different locations.
