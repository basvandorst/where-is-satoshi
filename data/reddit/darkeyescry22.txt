Fees are significantly higher than $6. They're currently between $15-20 to get them into a block in a reasonable amount of time.

There is no strategy that lets you hit the highs and lows with accuracy. In theory, you can make millions of dollars by trading every little fluctuation in any asset. The only reason people have any luck with that strategy with Bitcoin is because of the dramatic volatility and because people just believe Bitcoin will go up forever, and have happened to be right.

If the transaction ever goes through, you could potentially request a refund, but I have no experience there.
If it takes long enough, your transaction might be evicted (cancelled), and you'll get your money back.

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:32:11
Do you understand how bitcoin works? Genuine question. I don’t want to explain something you already know, so just let me know what you know, and I’ll fill in the gaps.

Clearly yes. They had information that no one in the public had about what their company was going to do. As you already said, the immediate impact of that action was rather easy to predict.
If someone who had access to this information acted on it, in order to make a profit, that is insider trading. However, in this situation it is not illegal. Crypto markets are not well regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:11
Insider trading isn’t dependent on market cap. It could be done at any time. It’s a pretty unavoidable problem, unless you make it illegal. It will still happen if you do, but less frequently.
Personally, I think we in the crypto space have to take the bullet on this one. Just like we have to take the bullet on the markets being open 24/7, and with the lack of IP protections.
I’m ok with all of those things, because I think the benefits are more important, but they are facts about our market that we should be aware of.

Ok, I see the problem. What you are describing is not insider trading.
Insider trading is using information about your companies future activities, which the public is unaware of, in order to make a profit.
If someone inside Coinbase, who knew this announcement was coming, bought BCH or sold BTC on the basis of that knowledge, they insider traded.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:42:25
Like I said, moving the goalposts. I never said they could handle that kind of load. They still do much better than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:41:55
You’re right! I shouldn’t have said that they converge. They shoot off in opposite directions
That said, for most applications, 1/0 is still assumed to be positive infinity, because it’s usually given that x is positive. And in either case, the answer is still essentially infinity. Saying “no, it’s not infinity, it’s undefined” is something that only a person who didn’t know the relevant math would say. Anyone who has taken calculus would have understood that statement, and that is what I was taking issue with.
But yes, you are correct that 1/0 is technically undefined, because it could either be positive or negative infinity. However, I do think it’s important to recognize that |1/0| is infinity, and cannot take on any other value. It’s undefined, but not in the sense that we have no idea what it could possibly be. We know what it is, it’s just a matter of defining the sign.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:58:27
What is one divided by a very small number? A very large number.
What about one divided by the very smallest number? The very largest number.
What is the very smallest number? Infinitesimal (very very very close to zero)
What is the very largest number? Infinity.
Sure, you can argue that 1/0 is undefined, but the left and right limits are defined and both converge on infinity. Arguing that any number divided by zero is not infinite is not an argument that means very much.

Monero has an adjustable blocksize. With bulletproof coming in 2018, capacity will be much higher. Cash has 8x the capacity, and also has the ability to increase that capacity through EC. LTC has 4x the capacity of bitcoin without Segwit, and people actually use Segwit on it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:05:01
You can call it whatever you want. People inside Coinbase obviously knew this announcement was coming. If anyone who knew that ahead of time bought BCH or sold BTC because of it, they insider traded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:35:58
Would you be willing to use it at $30 per transaction?
Bitcoin used to be useful, but it has hit capacity, and is now useless.

It’s not a scam. It’s just not able to handle the load anymore, because of the small block worshippers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:46
I didn’t say any of them could handle that kind of load. I was just countering your claim that they could only handle slightly more than bitcoin.
You’re moving the goalposts.

I doubt it will ever be useful again. LN is 18 months out TM. Do you think anyone will still be using it by then?
Monero, Cash, LTC, etc. are all functioning right now, and they aren’t going to run into these issues that bitcoin is facing.
Bitcoin is the classic example of a first mover that failed to innovate.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:06:13
Insider trading doesn’t have a particularly large impact either way. No more so than any other trade.
The negative of insider trading isn’t really about moving the price. The problem is that it’s an imperfection in the market.
Market theory assumes perfect knowledge by everyone in the market. Insider trading violates this assumption, which means it’s not a fair market.
Price manipulation is a different issue, which is dependent on market cap, but it’s not related to insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:10
It seems fairly obvious that a legal definition that doesn’t apply to cryptocurrencies wouldn’t apply to a situation about cryptocurrencies. The terminology is the only difference here. The actual activity is the same.
Like I said, you can call it whatever you want. I don’t have any attachment to the term insider trading. If you want to come up with a new one, I’m glad to use it. If you aren’t going to do that, I’m going to stick with this term, because it’s already in use and most people have understood what it meant so far.

You realize core is the one who would start the fork, right? BU is only going to activate when they have a majority of hashing power. At that point, that is btc. If core continues to use the short chain, they are the ones who forked, not BU.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:11:15
It's not about faith. It's about reality. Bitcoins price fluctuates an absurd amount to be putting literally all of your money into it.
There's also the tiny part where china could, at any moment, completely bankrupt you by banning BTC.
If you want to do it, that's your business, but don't act like a dick to the people who are pointing out that it's an exceptionally risky thing to do.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:35:29
Yeah. Again, that's how every other vehicle of investment works.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:07:42
It's no more of a pyramid scheme than gold or silver or any countries' fiat currency.
Right now, BTC isn't saturated. There's still more people buying than selling. That means it's a good point to buy in, if you want to make money.
Eventually, that growth will stop, and an oscillatory period will start.
At that point, the only way to make money would be to trade it, like what happens in a foreign exchange market.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:54:19
The value of bitcoin is roughly equal to the amount of money people have collectively spent on buying bitcoin divided by the total number of bitcoins in existence.
The "extra money" comes from people buying more than their selling.
This is the same mechanism that forms the "extra money" in foreign exchange markets, gold, silver, stocks, bonds, and oranges.

Did you really put that little research into how bitcoin works before you put money into it?

Sure, if you're a dipshit who sells low and buys high. The same could be said of any investment vehicle. Bitcoin is riskier than most, but that doesn't mean its inherently a net loss.

The consensus is determined by who has the hashing power. Yes, BU would start the fork, but it would be 100% on core if they continued to work on the short chain.

Let's pretend we're going back in time to the moment the very first person found gold.
They think it's a pretty metal, so they expend some energy to mine and process the metal.
Now, someone else sees the gold and they decide they want it. They offer the miner a chicken for a gram of gold, and the miner agrees to the trade.
At this point in time, the value of gold is one chicken per gram.
Now, the miners keeps mining, and more people start hearing about the new metal. For now, mining is going at a steady rate, and people have started trading gold for chickens and vice versa, but the net effect is more people trying to get gold than chickens, so the chicken/gold ratio goes up.
In economics terms, the supply curve is shifting to the right, and so is the demand curve, but demand is moving faster.
Next, you start mining all of the gold. It gets harder and harder to mine, as the amount of gold in the earth goes down. That means the rate supply is increasing goes down, but it's still increasing. Demand, is still increasing at roughly the same rate as before. At this point, the chicken to gold ratio is increasing faster than before.
After that, we run into the situation where demand stops increasing. This is the saturation of demand. Everyone knows about the new metal, and they have already established a personal judgment on its worth. This can change over time, but not at anywhere near the rate as in the previous phase. Supply is still increasing, but at an even slower rate. The chicken to gold ratio is now going down, but not a rapidly as it went up.
Finally, supply stops growing. All of the gold is out of the earth, and there's no more to be had. Demand is still in the same situation as before: small movements, but no general trend. At this point, the equilibrium has been reached, and the chicken to gold ratio stays relatively constant.
This is exactly the same as bitcoin, except for the fact that gold's limit and mining rate are physically defined, while BTC's are programmed, and the fact that gold can be shaped and used in other ways, while BTC can really only be used as BTC.

They matter a shit ton. If the price drops when your rent is due, you can't just say, "hold on a few days while my other currency recovers". You have to pay it then and there.
Bitcoin is great, and I am also invested in it, but putting all your egg in one basket is just irresponsible. If you don't want to wake up and find out your rent is twice as expensive, don't exclusively hold a "foreign" currency.

I didn't say to assume you were safe. I said that exploits are almost always found more quickly with Linux, because it is open source, and people outside of the developer group can check the code.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:36:30
I mean, they won't do it, but their miners will.
If BU waits until they have 70-80% of the hashpower, core is dead. Either they have to hardfork to adjust the difficulty, or they grind to a halt.
Considering they can't get anyone to agree to Segwit, I'm guessing the hardfork would be pretty disastrous for them.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:23:24
No, it's a system to allow market forces to determine the "correct" blocksize. Everyone independently sets their own parameters, and either they are compatible with the rest of the network, or the miner losses out on revenue.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:36:14
The claims that BU is trying to take over bitcoin.
The claims that BU is trying to force people to work for the dev team.
The claims that everyone wants to fork to reduce to difficulty.
And on and on and on. You've made so many intentionally misleading, or maybe just misinformed, statements that I couldn't possibly list them all out. If you want a complete list, just reread my comments.
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:58:40


Overblown statement. The bugs had almost zero impact on the network. Nodes went down for a few minutes.
Anyways, I'm not talking about the actual code. I'm talking about the goal. If a calculator messes up and starts saying 1 instead of 3, does that mean math doesn't work? No. It means there's a bug in the code.


That is 100% an opinion.


No it doesn't. You repeat this over and over again, but it's not true. This is a fallacy called "proof by assertion".


If you slowly increase the blocksize, nodes will be able to keep up just fine. The average speed of US internet users was [50Mbps down in 2016]( And that is obviously growing. It took several years to even get to 1MB blocks. There's no reason to think we'll be hitting anywhere near 6MB before internet speeds increase more.


Again, repeating things over and over again doesn't make it true. As others have already pointed out, BU doesn't make this an option any more than core does now. The dev was simply pointing out that a 1% inflation rate wouldn't obliterate bitcoin.


Before a couple of months ago, BU and Segwit combined made up less than half the miners. This myth that BU is somehow blocking Segwit is yet another "proof by repetition".
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:01:02
BU is growing in hash power, node count, blocks mined, and every other metric.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:37:09
That's not true any more. We're at the capacity, as far as transactions go. If you low ball the fee, and the fees continue to rise, your transaction will never go through.

Both of which are pretty sure bets. Sure, the CIA could exploit bugs in smaller distros, but the larger ones, like ubuntu or Debian, have tons of users. Many of those user check the source code with every update, and several of those people are computer science experts.
The CIA has money. That doesn't mean they have magical powers to come up with code that no one can comprehend.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:55:11
That's fine. I was simply dispelling this false claim:


That's not the worst case for core.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:18:31
Miners already have all the control. I don't get why this is so hard for everyone to understand. The only thing BU does is create a nonforking mechanism for block size changes.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:29:41
BU won't fork until they get 70-80% of the hashpower.
As much as you lot would like BU to suicide, they aren't going to do that. When they fork, BTC-c will have no choice but to die, or adjust the difficulty via a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:34:44
Then do it.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:23:21
It's not a popularity contest. BU still has a third of the network now.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:13:06
That is completely unrelated to what I said.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:46:33
And all of those places will do whatever happens to be economically beneficial to them. If the miners decided to change the block size, the majority of businesses would continue to accept bitcoin, because they don't give a shit about this philosophical civil war between a few thousand users.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:36:14

And that program would be...? How do you plan on educating 20% of the population, which can't afford education, without taxing the other 80%?


What is the alternative, which doesn't use taxation or truancy laws, but manages to educate the entire population?


You are, actually. Get rid of publicly funded education and you are doing exactly that.


The government doesn't run schools at a profit. If you want to dispute that fact, get some numbers (and not from your ass).
The rest of this paragraph is just weird rambling, so I don't know how to reply to it.
I'm a liberty minded person, and I see the incredibly obvious fact that educated people are more likely to want freedom than uneducated people. I also see that countries with high levels of education have higher GDPs.
No I'm not a bot.


So your plan to reduce government inefficiency is to require the government to look at every child individually, and assess their needs? Great plan...
Anyways, you're missing the point. I'm saying that shifting education to local government **increases** the total amount of inefficiency in the system, and increases the "size" of government.


I realize the date, thanks. And yes, the internet exists and will be an extremely useful tool for education. However, just giving kids a computer and telling them to learn isn't helpful. You still need standards for what must be learned to properly function in society (basic math, science, reading, history, etc.). Sure, there are plenty of ways to individualize education, via the internet, but that's a completely separate issue. You can do that with federal standards, state standards, local standards, or no standards at all. That's not what we're talking about.


If the state never arrests anyone, the "threat" of violence is nonexistent.


The state is given the power to do that **by the people**. If the state couldn't arrest anyone, everything (including murder, rape, theft, etc.) would be perfectly legal. The only enforcement would be other people. Without arbitration, a lot of innocent people would die from such a policy.


Yep! You're learning!
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:19:50
Can you seriously not see why a huge drop in the number of transactions, coupled with a significant drop in the price, might be just a little bit of a bid sign for bitcoin?
In case you can't put two and two together, **people are selling their BTC, because the current system has hit capacity**.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:42:10
Most is not the same as "everyone outside is fringe cases". Fringe cases implies that very few people fall in to that category, which is obviously not true. As you can see [here]( just under 20% of the country brings in less than $20,000/year of gross income. If schools were privatized, a quart to a half of their **gross** income would go to education **per kid**.
Also, the people who are too sparsely populated wouldn't go to school, either. I don't have the number of people who would have this problem, as no one has ever legitimately considered getting rid of public schools before, but I would guess that it's at least 1-5% of the country.
That big of a chunk of people who would be uneducated and locked in poverty is absolutely unacceptable.
And we aren't talking about college right now. I'm not saying everyone should get free college, but nice try ignoring the point. All I'm saying is that it's clear large number of parents would rather save their money than contribute to their child's education. By doing this, I'm doing something called providing supporting evidence for my argument.


No, it's not a business. It's a nonprofit. And very good. Schools are funded by taxes.
What I assume you are trying to say is that those things are bad, but again, you need to support your argument and say **why** they are bad.


Again, why? And why is this not one of those cases?


The federal government should set standards for all subjects. Social sciences are just as easily taught without bias as other subjects. If a teacher is teaching with a bias, they should be reprimanded or fired. That's not a flaw with the system, it's a flaw with the individual.
No, it shouldn't. Parents don't know jack shit about how to properly implement a curriculum. Implementation, just like conception, should be left to the people who have gone to school for several years to learn how to teach effectively.


You've got to be joking. How on earth is it better for a local representative to implement curriculum than for experts to do it?


And it would work fine for private schools. That doesn't get rid of the 20-25% of the country that has no access to education, or the however large group of people who's parents would rather save the money.


So you want them to... ask nicely? If there is no enforcement of the rules, the rules don't exist. If you just mean physical violence, I'm pretty sure that no school has ever been physically threatened by the government.


And that's fine! I support that! But your plan is blatantly ignoring massive problems. If you want private schools to be able to compete, set universal minimum standards for public and private schools, let individual schools teach beyond that, so long as the additional curriculum isn't biased (yes, that means no schools that exclusively teach creationism or anything like that), and then use a voucher system for all schools that comply.
That gives you free market competition, reduces indoctrination of children, and avoids widespread reduction in education levels.

Again, miners *could* do something stupid by intentionally forking their blocks, but they can do that now, too.
They don't. You know why? Because people don't like to piss away money.
So no, this doesn't worry me. People can put their settings wherever they want, but if they don't stick with the longest chain, it doesn't matter. They just lose money. Everyone else continues on as normal.

The bug had no impact on the network properly functioning. Nonmining nodes going down really doesn't matter very much.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:33:39
We used to have private schools. Turns out a lot of parents would rather save the several thousand dollars a year, and screw their children.
The concept is fine and dandy, but when you look at the reality of the situation, you're talking about taking away one of the most important tools to create economic mobility. Children don't have money to find a school, if their parents say no.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:00:32
I agree that there should be a split? The only people who don't think that are core supporters. The BU plan is to split, after they get a large enough majority.
There's no plans for a "hostile takeover" or any other propaganda bullshit. The plan is to fork, end of story.
So we want the same thing.
Edit: also, a majority of support in the dev community is about as important as a majority of support among nodes. It means fuck all.

It's not that fringe, actually. Tons of parents don't pay for their kids college education. And the number of parents who actually can't afford to pay for basic education is fairly high.
Also, it's not short term profit. It currently costs ~$10,000 per year, to send a kid to school. Even if you are extremely generous, and assume costs would go down by 50%, if schools were privatized, $5,000 x 13 years is $65,000 per child. For many people, that's three or four years of salary. With a reasonable 7% annual yield, that's ~$500,000 in 30 years (ignoring the interest earned during the first 13 years, when the kid would be in school.
Also, the idea that localizing schools is in any way "better" than federalizing the system is backed up by absolutely nothing. There is no evidence that it's more efficient, or that it provides better results. This is just a random anti government talking point used by republicans.
On the other hand, there is a very strong argument to make, that a child's education should not be based on where they live. Basic facts and methods don't change because you live in Texas, instead of New York. 2+3=5, no matter where you were born.
There is a valid argument about indoctrination, but I don't see how this is in any way mitigated by giving local governments control. They are still just as capable of indoctrination as the federal government, and history has shown that they are more willing to do so.
If you actually want to fix his problem, the answer is pretty easy. Don't teach opinions as facts. Require teachers to teach the kids multiple opinions, so that the kids are able to form their own.
For example, don't require teachers to only teach creationism or evolution/Big Bang. Have them teach both, and then provide the supplementary evidence. In this case, a 3000 year old book or fossil records, DNA evidence, and the CMB, etc.

I never said anything about what's happening **right now**. I was talking about the obvious mathematical fact that bitcoin transaction rates are limited, with the current set up.
Whatever else you think I was saying came from your imagination.

I already answered that. I said yes.
And no, it doesn't. See [here](

Honestly, I don't even have much of an opinion on BU. To me, it's a valid solution, by no means the only one.
But I am absolutely fed up with the bullshit in this subreddit. Every time I try to engage people to discuss the technical details of Segwi, BU, and LN, I just get called a shill or a dumbass, but I never get an actual response.
The biggest thing I've learned is that none of the loud mouth cunts know a damn thing about any of them. They just know they're supposed to hate one or the other.
And for a second, can we just appreciate how fucking ridiculous it is that people **hate** a piece of software? Not malware, software. And beyond that, they **hate** the fucking people who use it. **Its there fucking property** that they're installing this stuff on, but these people act like they're dumping uranium in a public lake or something.
This whole thing just blows me away.

If you double the number of coins, you halve the value of each coin.
It's not that anyone really loses out that much, but the cost of moving the money around would reduce the total value of the market by a sizable amount.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:01:38
I never said BU wasn't a hardfork? Are you really incapable of having a conversation without lying?
I have no basic misunderstanding of how bitcoin works.
Miners do set the rules. Users can choose to use their product or not, but users can't tell miners what to do.
I'm not misunderstanding or spreading disinformation.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:55:08
You're kind of missing the point. A parent has no incentive to send a kid to school, except altruism.
If a parent decided to not send their kids to school, and just saved/invested the money instead, they would be significantly better off, but their kids wouldn't be.
Their kids couldn't get a job, or even do basic math, or even read. They would be completely nonfunctional in the modern world, but they had absolutely zero say in that. Their parents screwed them.
Now, you can say something like, "parents care about their kids", but that is simply untrue. Many parents care about their kids, and would happily pay for their kids education, but many would not.
That means economic mobility is no longer a thing. Your success in life suddenly depends entirely on your parents.
Now, if your plan is to still enforce truancy laws, while also getting rid of public schools, you run into a whole different set of issues.
First of all, people who can't afford education are now being arrested. This further reduces economic mobility.
Also, you run into the issue of economically unviable schools. Some towns simply can not support a school, due to the size of their population and other similar factors.
If you have public schools, that doesn't matter. You just absorb the loss with the economic capacity of an entire state, or country.
If you don't, then those people don't get to have a school. But you made that illegal, so they now have to drive hours away, or he parents have to quit their job, and homeschool. Again, decreasing economic mobility.
There are ways to privatize education, like voucher systems, and online education, but even in those systems, you need a public option, or you end up in a situation where someone with poor parents has no choice but to be poor too. That is fundamentally against a functional capitalistic society.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:57:30
That's some nice bullshit, mate. Miners already have the power to do anything they want. They are the ones who make bitcoin work.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:41:13
Oh I get what you're saying now. I thought you were saying you couldn't get one, where you were, which is why I was confused.

Linux will welcome you with open arms!
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:38:16
What kind of bull shit logic is that? If BU forks, it will be after they already have 70-80% of miners signaling from them. The idea that anyone would favor the coin that takes over 40 minutes to verify a transaction (assuming all non BU miners were willing to operate at a significant loss for 2 months, to hit the difficulty reset) is just obnoxious.
If the fork happens, core has already lost the fight, and they have no more power.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:42:30
Good news on that front as well! There are open source routers. You can also configure your own router, if you want.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:12:07
And guess what? If miners don't produce any blocks that nodes reject, it doesn't matter. The nodes that accept the block propagate it to other nodes that will accept it.
Meanwhile, the hold outs wait for longer and longer periods of time for block that they will accept. That chain grows slower and slower, the transactions take longer and longer, and everyone stops using it, because it no longer does the one thing that a cryptocurrency is supposed to do; move value from one person to another.
Nodes can reject anything they want. So can you. It doesn't mean anything. There will always be some nodes that accept the blocks, and those nodes can operate independently of the do nothing nodes.
If companies want to make an ethical stance and stick with the nonexistent core remains, they are free to do so, but they will no longer be offering a product that's worth anything.
Again, if you believe so strongly in the power of nodes to control the network, just go invest in enough to keep BU from happening, and go ahead and give yourself 10 million bitcoins while your at it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:25:57
I assumed it was obvious that immediately was a hyperbole. I didn't realize that I am only allowed to use hard literals.

Saying things doesn't make it so. It does work.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:27:02
Lmfao, mate it would take two months for a difficulty reset to trigger. And that's assuming all the core miners will be willing to run their rigs at a dramatic loss for that entire time.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:16:08
They also had two recent bugs, which BU kindly told them about, quietly. You know, instead of just tweeting about them.
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:11:20
Mate, you're completely ignoring what I said. You're just saying you don't like BU. Good for you. That doesn't disprove the arguments I made.
I don't care what you believe, so long as you can defend it. So far, you have not done that.
If you don't have anything to add to the debate, just stop replying. You just keep using logical fallacies and throwing out insults. There's no point. You're not going to change my mind by calling me names, and no one else is reading this.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:19:52
Based on what? It's now responsible for a third of the network, and the pressure is on to get rid of the 1MB limit, now that transactions can't go through.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:33:18
I know what a node does. It's role in deciding blocksize is minuscule. Nodes are cheap and cost very little to maintain. Mining rigs are expensive and cost large amounts of money to operate.
The core nodes can reject BU blocks all day, but that won't stop them from propagating them. Those nodes that refused to conform to the standard would simply become irrelevant.
If you want to test this, go set up 100,000 nodes that only accept blocks with more than 1 MB, and watch absolutely nothing happen.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:41:17
Jesus Christ dude, no one is telling you or core to "just give up and let BU win". Core can do anything they want.
You people and your victim complexes.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:26:11
I didn't say they were like this. Learning to read really helps with debates. You should try it some time.
Assuming you managed to get through that monster of a paragraph, we can now talk about the point you were trying to make.
The core bugs were smaller, yes, but they were also handled under the table. BU didn't send out a tweet about them like Core did. They privately told them about it, so they could fix the bugs without hurting the network.
Core, on the other hand, thought it would be funny to put a third of the network at risk by publicly announcing the security flaw.
Luckily, their spite driven stupidity didn't cause too much harm, because a hot fix was already released, and most BU miners are intelligent enough to not leave their set up vulnerable to this kind of attack.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:31:13
Yup. It "crashed" all the way to an all time high in hashing power.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:42:49
The low fees exist because you don't use bitcoin.
It's like when there's heavy traffic on the freeway, so everyone goes on back roads. Then everyone takes the freeway, because it's empty. And then it's full again.
Nothing has actually changed. People just lost interest in the useless transaction system.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:07:30
Saying things doesn't make them true. The fact that you couldn't even come up with an example shows that you're just pulling things out of your ass to attack me with.
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:04:57
No worries! As long as you're civil, and you don't make bullshit/dishonest arguments, I'm perfectly happy to chat with you. It's the people who insist on throwing out insults and fallacious arguments that bother me.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:10:09
No, they get paid either way. Miners get both the reward **and** the transaction fees.
Miners could choose to pay themselves additional coins, but I would think that the other miners would probably just reject the block, as it directly reduces the value of their holdings.
Also, miners are disincentivized to give themselves a reward, as that would make bitcoin inflationary, which would probably make some users sell off their holdings.
I think it's important to once again point out that these things are possible **right now**. You can go mine a block and give yourself 10,000,000 btc, if you felt like it. But all the other miners would reject your block, and even if they didn't, everyone would immediately stop using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:55:56
Well no shit. That doesn't magically get rid of the people who don't pay the higher fees.
There is an absolute limit to the number of transaction/time that can be processed by btc. That's a purely mathematical fact.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:28:32
Oh I'm sorry. I forgot about the entirely irrelevant metric that you're using to determine who's closer to activation.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:21:58
That's all fine and dandy, but it's pretty stupid to just let your savings lose 25% of its value in a couple of week, just to make a weird ethical stand.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:23:03
No, we don't. I don't care what core does. They are perfectly to make any changes to their code that they want. I don't care.

That's fine. They are free to do what they want. Doesn't change the fact that some nodes will.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:04:45
Yes, that's where the issue comes from.
I just don't give a shit. The reality is that whatever costs money is what controls the system.
Nodes are cheap, mining rigs are not. If the miners change the code, everyone else either stops using their product or the use it. That's the only say nodes and users have.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:34:52
No one is making anyone do anything. This isn't happening. It's 100% made up in your head.
BU is waiting for miners to decide **with their own free will** to switch to BU. They literally aren't doing anything to hurt core right now.
If miners don't switch, BU doesn't fork, core continues on forever, unimpeded. If miners do **choose** to switch to BU, BU forks, core deals with their own problems, and everyone moves on with their lives.
No one is "forcing" anyone to do anything.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:41:12
What? Those are completely unrelated things.
What they mean is that hashrate is the only meaningful measurement of how effective BU will be after a fork. That is 100% true.
If they fork now (33%), that fork will not be able to confirm transactions in any reasonable amount of time.
If they get 50%, there will be two roughly equal powered chains, both of which can technically survive.
If they get 70-80%, only BU will survive, because core will no longer be able to confirm transactions.
That's what they mean by "only hash rate matters", and they are absolutely right, in that regard.
What the quote you linked to is saying, is that there are different kinds of nodes. Some mine blocks, while others simply watch and keep track of the network.
Pretty much anyone from that sub could tell you the same thing. That doesn't change the fact that node count has nothing to do with forking potential.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:37:32

Great propaganda skills, mate.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:17:06
None of what you just said is backed up by anything. Like I already pointed out, **nodes have no control**. If miners want to change bitcoin, they can. They don't need BU to do that.
Also, nodes are perfectly free to ignore BU blocks, if they want to. If they have as much power as you pretend, they could just ignore this debate altogether.
You're spreading propaganda that doesn't make any sense. If nodes have the power, no amount of hashpower could change BTC, yet you claim BU will magically make it so nodes have no power **by having more hashpower**.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:49:30
This is exactly what politicians are saying when they say shit like "give governments back doors for encryption".

Those are exceptions, not the rule. How many exploits do get caught, in a timely manner? A huge number. Far more than with closed source software.
Immediate was obviously a hyperbole, but once again I overestimated the intelligence of the average Reddit user. Maybe one day I'll remember that I have to explicitly say everything about everything to avoid dipshits getting upset with me. L
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:32:36
That's another nice pile of unfounded bullshit.
The extremely vast majority of bitcoin users don't give a single fuck how big the blocksize is. They will use the coin that works. Any business that attempts to not support that coin will be operating at a loss, as that network won't be able to mine blocks.
You believe people are willing to do things that are economically harmful just to make an ethical stand on blocksize. That's an assumption that makes no sense, and until you let go of it, you'll hold fallacious beliefs.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:35:40
Again, you're saying that, but not showing any proof. The price **is changing**. You can't just say it's not because of BU.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:09:29
No, they aren't binding. But they are signaling for BU. You can twist that in whatever unfounded way you need to to support your delusion, but that's the fact of the situation.
And when it comes to forking, miners are the only part of the network that matters.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:54:27
I like how you just throw that out like it's not an opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:14:54
What he's saying is that it's ironic that you consider this sub to be a place where differing opinions are openly discussed, when discussing alternatives to core will get you banned.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:15:44
BU won't fork until they have 70-80% of the hashing power.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:24:18
The most obvious reason not to do that is the large cost of selling all of the bitcoins to buy the new coins.
Aside from that, there's the issue that miners would have to switch to the new coin, which doesn't make a whole lot of economic sense for them, as they would basically be working for free, at least for a little while.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:58:30
I'm sure the fact that it's lining up with the average block size hitting 1MB is purely coincidental...
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:56:27
Well yeah, everyone gets that. The point is that the rules are against alternative views, which is what you are saying is wrong with BU supporters.
So why is it ok for the subreddit rules to discriminate against people who disagree with you, but it's not ok for people who disagree with you to complain about the rules that stop them from giving you a legitimate argument against your beliefs?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:39:14
Again, no evidence, no support, just name calling.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:25:52
You don't need everyone to see the code. You need one person to see it, and tell everyone else about it.
Considering there are quite a few people who check every release of their distro of choice, I seriously question anyone who think this form of attack would be even remotely effective.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:29:15
Ah, sorry I misread your comment.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:25:39
Right now, sure. But no one is talking about forking **right now**. BU won't fork until they **at least** have 50% of the network. Realistically, they will shoot for 70-80%.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:35:58
I don't see any reason that would be the case. If you use bitcoin as your primary currency, you have pretty limited incentive to invest in companies, which is where true wealth actually comes from, in the long run.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:28:36
Those are almost universally minuscule security bugs that aren't causing large scale problems.
Also, by definition, the distros that are used the most are the most capable of fixing security flaws.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:43:28
More name calling, and absolutely no refutation to my argument. Your argument hinges on the idea that all nodes will continue to run core, despite core miners not being able to produce blocks. Since that is nonsense, so is your argument. If you want to support your argument, support that claim.
If you can't support your argument, keep calling me names.
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:20:22
And your rebuttal is nonexistent.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:33:33
That's exactly what I was thinking. The plan is basically to sell a bunch of land to people and then leave them to their own devices.

How do you figure? Most people on that sub could have told you the same thing.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:06:03
You're misunderstanding BU. It's **supposed** to orphan blocks **that don't meet the market set blocksize range**.
And the risk of double spending doesn't increase. Transactions are still validated just like before.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:42:03
That's what "not outward facing" means. They don't let random connections come in.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:49:52
Actually, they can. They can run any software they want, on their nodes. It's purely a matter of economic incentives that keeps them in consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:42:02
Just a heads up. That is not why the price dropped this morning. Also, BU is **not** threatening to fork BTC if they don't get what they want.
The price dropped because the price had reached an all time high and stayed there for a few days. From a traders perspective, that's time to sell.
Also, china once again made steps towards regulating BTC. It looks like they now plan to blacklist certain addresses, that exchanges won't be allowed to send or receive coins from.
As far as this forking business goes, a large mining pool recently decided to support BU, which brings it close to the point of forming a majority fork.
That said, no one is planning on forking right now. For BU to succeed in forking, they need at least more than 50%. Forking before that would mean the death of BU.
But realistically, BU won't fork until they get upward of 70-80%. The reason for that is that, if core attempts to maintain their minority fork, BU could counter that chain with enough hashing power to force them to stop.
This is a good thing, as two BTC chains means a large decrease in the value of BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:33:34
Ok, replace gold with any nations fiat currency, except supply never stops growing.

Then your getting your code from the wrong place...
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:00:50
My point is that there is price movement, and you are assuming it's not because of BU, but you haven't given any reason why you think that is the case.
So, to use your analogy, it's like if there were a ton of tigers around you, you picked up a rock, they all ran away, and you said "this rock has nothing to do with why they ran away".
That might be the case, but you can't prove it. Which is what I'm trying to point out.
Also, volatility is also up, so I don't get what you're saying, with your last point.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:41:05
Wow, you mean letting people trade something that currently exists for something that may never exists results in people choosing the one that does exist?
I'm stunned.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:05:43


You didn't specify specify which you were talking about. Either way, your argument doesn't refute mine.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:23:55
Woah, woah, woah. You were all right up until you said this:


A small number of exploitations doesn't make the OS unsafe.
The fact that people can easily see the code **does not** make it easier to exploit, either. The whole point I'm making is that being able to see the code means finding **and fixing** exploitations is far easier.
Black hat hackers can find the bugs, but developers will close those bugs much more quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:21:09
Sorry, the US
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:03:40
By forking, yes. That means fork, once they have enough hashing power to ensure there own survival. At which point, core is free to do what they want, but they will most likely fail, as they would have limited support at that point.
I really don't see what you guys are complaining about. If the miners don't support BU, it doesn't happen. It's really pretty reasonable. You guys just want the fork to happen now, because that would mean BU failing. Stop acting like this is some reasonable compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:43:50
And it's equally easy for a user to find the same bug and report it to the community/dev team.
Easily spotted bugs are not easily exploited bugs.
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:28:13
Mate, this is math.
Difficulty is reset every 2016 blocks.
If core miners have 25% of the total hashpower, it would take an average of 40 minutes to nine a block.
So, 40 minutes/block times 2016 blocks gives you 56 days before the reset.
Miners currently operate at a pretty thin margin, so cutting the revenue down to 25% of the current revenue means the miners would be operating at a big loss.
Now, put yourself in the miners' shoes. You have three options:
Continue operating at a loss for at least 56 days. Which means probably going bankrupt.
Switch to BU and return to roughly pre fork revenue.
Close up shop.
Which would you do?
Also, it's worth noting that the value of BTC-c would drop, as it would suddenly take at least 4x as long to confirm a transaction.
It's also worth noting that every time a miner chooses to drop core, the outlook looks even worse for the remaining holdouts.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:50:08
Miners can use any software they want. Without using BU, they can change the blocksize **right now**.
What BU does is create a mechanism to change the block size without having to coordinate a hard fork every couple of years.
So no, there's no fallacy.
Edit: but it's nice to see you're at least pretending to counter my argument. It's an improvement over your typical strategy of just calling me names (even though you still couldn't help yourself).
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:48:53
**You** are not **we**.
And it doesn't matter how much of an "old timer" someone is.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:18:59
No, it means creating a new set of rules that is not backwards comparable with the previous set.
A hard fork doesn't mean there has to be two chains.
For example, monero has hardforked in order to update, but everyone agreed to it before hand.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:30:45
Please ignore the other person who replied to you. They aren't manipulating anyone, unless you call pointing out the obvious fact that blocks are full.
They are waiting to have a larger share of the network, before forking. Initiating a fork with only a third of the network would mean certain failure of the coin.
They will need at least 50%, to successfully fork, and around 70-80%, to do so without creating two separate BTCs.
Because of the way bitcoin works, reaching that 70-80% would basically mean that BTL would never be able to confirm transactions, so everyone would just stop using it. This would also mean more miners would switch, because they would start losing money, by staying with BTL, thus further decreasing their ability to confirm transactions. Eventually, they just won't be worth anything.

A third of the blocks being mined are signaling BU.

So what metric are you using? Node count is below half, hash power is below half, blocks mined is below half.

It really isn't. You can choose to get into the nitty gritty of the OS, but you can completely ignore that, if you want.

@_date: 2017-03-16 01:13:55
Mate, if no one can spend bitcoins, they aren't worth a damn thing.
Also, again, nodes rejecting a block doesn't mean anything.
If I wanted to, I could buy 100,000 nodes for relatively little money, and have those nodes only accept blocks that start with the number 7. That doesn't suddenly decrease the value of bitcoin. Miners don't have to start adding a 7 to the start of every block.

Miners would have a perfectly acceptable day, revenue wise, as long as they are mining the dominant chain.
You can live in delusion if you want to, but that's a verifiable fact.
When it comes to hard forks, hash power is the only thing that matters.
Maybe it would help you understand if you understand how bitcoin works.
When you make a transaction, you are sending a string of information that says, "this address is sending this many bitcoins to this address" out to the network.
Miners then pull a certain number of those strings into a block, which they will try to confirm, through a highly resource intensive mathematical process. 
Hash power is a measure of how much computing resource is being put towards confirming the block. The more hash power you have, the more "guesses" you can make in an interval of time.
Whoever happens to pick the right guess first, gets to submit that block to the network.
Now comes the part where nonmining nodes do something.
The other nodes on the network now can choose to either add the block to the block chain, or reject it. Each node does this independently, and it doesn't matter to any particular node what any other node is doing.
Now for the final important point. The "difficulty" of guessing correctly, and mining a block, is based on the total hashing power on the network, and is only changed after a certain number of blocks are mined (2016, to be specific).
So that's what is happening now. Here's what happens if BU has a majority of hashing power, but core has more nodes.
Whenever a BU mining node mines a block, all BU nodes accept that block, and add it to their chain. All non compliant nodes (core) reject the block. In effect, this creates two chains. The core mining nodes will continue to try to find blocks under 1MB, but it will take significantly longer.
Because of that slow down, core miners will now make a quarter of what they used to (assuming the value of the coins stays the same, which it won't). In reality, the coins will be worth **at most** 1/2 the original value, before the fork. So best case for a core miner is 1/8th their previous profits.
For most miners, that means running for a loss. A BIG loss. Now, it's true that **eventually** the difficulty will be reset, and revenue will be back to normal (assuming 0 core miners switch to BU, and all of them continue operation, that would take 2 months), but by then, most miners would have incurred significant losses.
The more realistic situation is most Core miners switch, or stop mining, and the difficulty is never reset. In which case, BU is the only BTC.
Hope that helped.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:20:33
See what? You're not making any sense, mate.
About 400 nodes went down, but the hashtags actually went up, while that happened.
In other words, the mining nodes didn't go down, in the first place, because they weren't vulnerable to the bug. Maybe that's because they were running core, but the more likely answers are that they aren't outward facing, and/or they run multiple clients, in case something like this happens.
You can see this in core nodes as well. If you look at the graph, over the last few months, you see two dips in core nodes due to bugs, but no corresponding dips in blocks mined or hash power.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:45:16

Ah, gotcha. Yeah I would advise not using any non open source software, if your number one concern is privacy.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:07:09
It's incredibly simple to show why this is true.
Currently, 1MB gets confirmed every 10 minutes.
Average tx is ~226B. So that's ~4640 tx per 10 minutes.
If there are more than 4640 txs per 10 minutes, on average, transactions will never go through.
Now, currently, every time the pool of unconfirmed txs has gotten built up, people stop using btc as much, and the backlog has cleared.
But if usage continues to grow, it may no longer be able to clear.
But the reality is usage will just stop growing once capacity gets reached, as no one wants to use a currency that doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:50:22

You claimed that miners' revenue wouldn't drop, if the fork happens.
That means you assumed fees quadrupled.
If you aren't making that assumption, don't make claims based on that assumption.
Edit: actually, I was wrong. The revenue of miners only goes down if people stop using BTC-c.
That said, I still think it's pretty likely that many users will not use a coin that takes 40 minutes to confirm.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:13:49
Full nodes don't do a damn thing. I could go buy 100,000 full nodes for a pretty small amount of money, and only accept blocks that give me 500 bitcoins.

You originally said this:


I then pointed out that:


Your statement was false. Whatever else you think happened, did not.


Yet, if you go back and read this conversation, you will see you and myself consistently refer to **after** the mining reward dried up.


Actually, as far as I can tell we are only talking about the singular decision to implement EDA in BCH. Anyways, we weren't even talking about that to begin with. We were discussing whether or not it was likely for miners to hyperinflate BCH by switching back and forth between mining BCH and BTC.


You seem to have missed the point. I'm saying that your scenario is incredibly unlikely **if EDA stays in**. I'm not saying it would need to be removed to avoid 11+ years of oscillatory behavior, which is already damping itself out.


Again, you are really missing the point. EDA is not an issue. It's not a bug. It's not something that needs to be fixed. It was an extremely smart move that prevented BCH from dying in the cradle from a crippling slow block rate and low profitability. The EDA worked perfectly and has had no negative side effects. It reduced the initial difficulty very quickly, and then oscillated for a few times before losing its energy and coming (close) to rest.

I think what he means is the idea of solely using BTC as currency is kind of stupid, ATM. The market cap is too low, and doing so puts you at a pretty huge risk. What if some big investor decided to pull out a day before your rents due, and then reinvests the day after. You just lost money for no reason. Compare that to the USD and the effective long term cost of your rent is actually far less. BTC is good for holding or immediate transfer spending. It's not good to use as a primary currency.

Bitcoin is not the currency of a disaster. That goes for Segwit and cash. Bitcoin depends very heavily on rapid, global propagation of blocks. If there is a regional outage, that region is shit out of luck, because any transaction they make there will not make it out to the rest of the network. It will simply be invalidated.
Your scenario would be a disaster for any and all cryptos. Segwit is no exception.

That's wrong. The difficulty is adjusted down by 20% if fewer than 6 blocks are found in 12 hours. This will continue until that condition isn't met.
So log(% of Hashrate*8)/log(.64) = tmax[in days]
Plug in the variables you like best, but that's the maximum time it will take for BCH to have the same transaction capacity as BTC before the fork (1MB no Segwit).

First of all, this post should not be your only source as it's obviously going to be biased.
Second, you shouldn't put 80-90% of your savings into **anything**. The key to a successful and stable investment strategy is diversity. Buy gold, buy stocks, buy bonds, **and** buy bitcoin.
Third, I would strongly advise not dumping a load of money into bitcoin, ATM. Despite all the circle jerking that's going on in this sub right now, the reality is that BTC will almost definitely take a hit very soon. There's also the currently unresolved blocksize cap issue and there's really no telling what's going to happen when we run up against that wall.

Changing the blocksize limit isn't a difficult thing to do. It's just a variable.

That's not true. If miners aren't making money, they'll simply stop mining. Once enough miners drop out, the remaining miners will make enough to sustain themselves.
The price has nothing to do with the size of fees.

No, not 96hrs. That would be how long it would take if the difficulty wasn't adjusted.
But, the essence of your question is correct. It will take a pretty long time to conduct transactions on the early BCH chain.
That said, keep in mind that 8x as many transactions can fit in each block. That doesn't help with confirmation times, but it does mean that the first confirmation won't take quite as long.

I know what net neutrality is. I was just pointing out that we currently have net neutrality. That fact somewhat weakens the “we shouldn’t let the government pass net neutrality” argument that I’ve seen here unsettlingly often.
Also, if your only argument against net neutrality is that it’s a “regulation”, that’s not an argument. Yes, regulations create costs for companies. Yes, certain regulations can cause more problems than they solve. But that isn’t an argument for why we shouldn’t have any regulations at all.
Also, ISPs would form monopolies with or without net neutrality. Firstly, because ISPs require a massive amount of capital to start. A new ISP is always at a tremendous disadvantage in terms of the price they can afford to offer customers.
Secondly, because building the infrastructure for an ISP requires gaining access to a large web of land. This is made easier by governments letting them run lines along side the roads, but that also means that small municipal governments have control over new ISP creating.
You’re thinking very simplistically about a very complex issue. Getting rid of net neutrality doesn’t magically deregulate ISPs. They will still be in a very imperfectly competitive market, even if net neutrality gets repealed. The only difference is that internet content providers will no longer have a low barrier to entry, and will have to do whatever the ISPs want them to.
And no, most people can’t just switch ISPs. For the reasons explained above, most peoples ISP options are limited to [one or two providers]( Competition doesn’t exist enough to regulate ISPs. They have no reason to self regulate because the market incentives to do so simply don’t exist in their market.

You know the whole not giving sources because you couldn’t find any, while you insisted that, if the data did exist, it would totally agree with you? That’s where you “just said things”.
If you want to continue this conversation, provide evidence that there are more ISP options now. It’s not my job to find data to refute your claim before you even find anything to support them. If you can’t do it, stop using the argument.
I’m basing my opinion on the fact that most people would have zero alternatives to their current ISP, if they suddenly started throttling connection to Netflix. The few that would have options would have one or maybe two if they’re lucky. What if those also throttle Netflix or whatever? If you want a citation, it’s called [monopolistic competition]( and it’s taught in every intro to Econ class.
Also, we aren’t talking about price, so I’m not sure why you even bothered to bring that up.

Mate, if you want to have a conversation, can you please talk about reality, instead of just saying what you wish were true?
ISPs are a classic example of economy’s of scale. Larger firms will always be able to put compete smaller firms in this area. Hell, look at google fiber. That was a massive company, and even they couldn’t meet their goals with it.


That’s cool. When ISPs start setting up wireless internet that can compete with wired, we can talk about it. Until then, it’s not really relevant.

I already provided the evidence for that. You ignored it because it didn’t agree with you. You then provided additional resources that reinforced my claim, and pretended it said the opposite of what it actually did (seems to be a habit of yours).


I know what your point was. It’s irrelevant. If anything, this is making your argument worse. It takes a special person to somehow think that this statement supports your views.


Net neutrality is not a barrier to entry. Again, you’re showing your complete lack of education in economics. A barrier to entry is something that makes starting a new company hard. Net neutrality doesn’t do that.
What is a barrier to entry is the massive infrastructure cost of building an ISP, thus why ISPs tend to form monopolies.
Now, have fun not understanding this post.

IOTA still has a decentralized database. I think this is where your confusion is coming from.
IOTA uses a tangle, instead of a blockchain, but the tangle is still verified by the community. So no one can just create IOTA out of nothing, like you seem to be suggesting.
IOTA’s entire fixed supply is already in existence and no more will be created. In order for more to be made, the entire network would have to agree, just like with bitcoin.
Well, not “just like” with bitcoin. The general idea is the same, but the users are the ones doing the PoW, so miners don’t exist and therefore can’t influence the network.

Both of those resources are backing up my source. Most places have only one or two options.
Also, mobile internet (especially 3G) is not even remotely comparable to landline internet. The source I provided breaks up providers by speed, which illustrates your confusion.
There are “plenty” (maybe 3 or 4) of options for extremely slow internet, but how on earth does that support the idea that there is enough competition to keep ISPs in line? These companies don’t even have the infrastructure to compete in terms of speed.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:50:51
Yes, it’s old data. You can’t just assert that the world has shifted to support your beliefs in those 3-4 years. You have to provide evidence for that.
And I’ve put in every zip code I’ve ever lived in, and they’ve all had 1 or 2 ISPs that cover the whole area with reasonable speed, and a smattering of lesser areas with slow speeds.
For example, look at Atlanta (the 39th largest city) let’s look at 3 zips picked at random.
2 providers with majority coverage and no data caps.
2 providers with majority coverage and no data caps.

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:49:16
Well let’s start by calming down. Nothing at all about this conversation requires emotional reactions. We’re talking about bitcoin, not someone’s mother being raped.
Now, on the the point you raised. Yes, it’s true that you can pay a higher fee and get your transaction to the front of the line. No one is disputing that. It’s also true that under standard operating procedure, the highest paying users can expect to wait about 10 minutes for confirmation.
However, yesterday was a real life demonstration of what will happen when the blocks fill up. Yes, **you** can pay a higher fee to get your transaction through, but so can everyone else. If you have enough people using bitcoin that you generate 1.1MB (adjust this to whatever number is appropriate, now that Segwit has been implemented) of transactions per 10 minutes, **someone** will have to use some other medium of exchange.
If you just try to pay a higher fee, when everyone else is trying to pay a higher fee, how high must you go? Yesterday, that number got as high as $15. That wasn’t people paying more than they needed to. That was the **minimum** fee required to get into the next block.
Bitcoin has a hard usage cap, and we have hit it. Every time cash has a price increase, bitcoin will have $15 or $30 or $100 fees. There is no cap on the fees. Where will that leave bitcoin?

Yes, that's true, but that's no different than a miner deciding to run 8MB right now.
Could they do it? Yes. But it would make them lose out on income, and the rest of the network would barely notice, unless it was a big pool. But seeing as big mining pools have the most to lose from doing something stupid, you can be pretty sure they won't do it.
If you want proof of that, keep in mind that, **right now**, someone could change the max block size in their core code, and fork off the chain. No one does it, because it's economically harmful to do so.

And doing nothing scales even worse, in the realm of O(0). 


All of that is 100% true. However, all of those things are growing significantly faster than the tx rate.


This is an incredibly weak argument. Give **specific** issues. Generally saying "this is bad" is exactly what I was complaining about the OP doing.


This is nonsense. Spam attacks only work when there is too small of a limit on the transaction rate. This is made better by BU, not worse.
If you want to prove this wrong, provide evidence. Specify what someone could actually do, and why you think BU would be less able to deal with that attack that 1MB.


Is this seriously your attempt at convincing me you know what you're talking about? Is the bitcoincore website where you get all of your technical info from? I'm asking you to actually defend your position, not for an FAQ link from an obviously biased source.
Here, this totally proves that BU works. 
This is exactly what I'm complaining about. You guys just throw crap out but you **refuse** to engage in a simple discussion on the pitfalls of the different proposals.

@_date: 2017-04-17 15:04:10


I hope you know this is entirely dependent on what you are saying is on the order of O(0). I interpreted your comment as referring to the transaction rate, where O(0) would mean "on the order of zero transactions", which is of course an exaggeration. The reality would be O(C), where C is the maximum number of transactions allowed by a 1MB blocksize.
If you meant to refer to something else, please explain what you meant.


I'm not asking you to compare the relative merits of BU and Segwit. I asked you for specific examples of how BU would make things worse than they currently are. Many of the posters in this sub, seem to be under the impression that BU would "destroy bitcoin". That is the claim I'm trying to get one of you to defend with a rational argument. So far, I have been unsuccessful in doing so.


I'm quite familiar with both. However, neither of those things are what I'm asking for. General handwaving "this is really bad" is pointless. I'm asking for an actual defense of the claims, not for more claims without backing.


Are you incapable of putting the argument into your own words? You're using fallacious tactics to avoid a discussion. Telling me to look up every single argument made is shifting the burden of proof. It is your job to bring up specific problems with BU (compared to 1MB, not Segwit).


Your rejection is my rejection. Make the argument yourself. Stop being lazy. This is why there is gridlock in the scaling debate. You refuse to make your own argument and rely on clearly biased sources (the fucking FAQ from core, really? Of course they are in favor of themselves).


I'm playing devils advocate. Quite frankly, I just want bitcoin to scale, and I see no legitimate gripe with either protocol. What I'm asking you to do is to stop dodging the debate. Actually engage in discussion, or your crypto is going to crash and burn, while its competitors move on.

I thought Soros was openly doing this. Now he’s obviously not going to be open about it? You seem confused.


Given the choice between living in a third world country and a first world country, which would you choose?

Nodes don’t control the network. It would insanely easy to take it over if you just needed 50% of nodes.

What is with everyone putting spaces before punctuation today? You're the second one who's done it.
Anyways, I think you're kind of stretching. There's nothing very contrary between EC and bitcoin. The only difference is that you no longer need a hardfork to change the blocksize. It's just a more democratic way to determine a setting.

I never said climate change wasn't happening?
I said it's not "severe in the short term". I completely agree that it's going to be quite disastrous, if nothing is done about it (especially for coastal regions), but that's not the same as the human race going extinct in 100 years.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:51:34
Well yes, but believe it or not, we've developed a few new technologies in the past 13000 years, which make us a little bit harder to kill.

This is so obnoxiously, blatantly false that I don't know what to say.

That's a nice assumption you have there. It must be nice to be able to read people's minds.


That had absolutely nothing to do with the popularity of BU? Are you new here or something? How on earth did you miss the multiple bugs that brought down outward facing nodes?


I didn't? I know it's easier to just make up an argument to argue against than it is to just argue against what I actually said, but it doesn't really do anyone any good.
But your claim that BU is blocking Segwit is simply not true. Segwit had plenty of time to garner support, before BU passed it. Anyway, BU doesn't do anything to block Segwit. People signaling for BU doesn't stop Segwit from being implemented. But even if it did, Segwit doesn't have enough support to pass, BU or no.
This argument is as stupid as me saying you're the reason I'm not a billionaire, because you have a million dollars.

First of all, I need to be clear that I'm not a climate scientist, and my words shouldn't be taken as a source. That said, I will so my best to provide sources, which are legitimate.


I hadn't heard of this before, but (according to a quick wiki check) this is not likely to be a threat.
See wiki citation here:
[3] Sowers, Todd (10 February 2006). "Late Quaternary Atmospheric CH
4 Isotope Record Suggests Marine Clathrates Are Stable". Science. 311 (5762): 838–840. Bibcode:2006Sci...311..838S. doi:10.1126/science.1121235. PMID 16469923.


This is legitimate, but it's not a big enough deal to greatly expedite climate change. Usually, this is accounted for in climate change models.


Again, this is a legitimate issue. Depending on how humanity responds to climate change, as much as half the world population will be displaced by rising water levels. That would, of course, be catastrophic to the world economy and many people will probably die. However, that's still far from extinction, and as the Dutch have proven for many years, the ocean doesn't always beat the humans.


Again, this is an issue. Many people will die from extremely violent storms, both directly and as a result of poor crops. Ocean current disruption would also result in pretty wild climate changes in some regions (like North America).
I think the really important factor to consider is time. If we all woke up tomorrow and someone had released tons of greenhouses gases over night, we probably would be in for a pretty massive die off (potentially even extinction, but probably not).
But that's not what will happen. These changes will take place over many many decades, giving us time to move, adapt, and otherwise prepare. Think about what our level of technology was in 1900, compared to 2000.
Edit: forgot to talk about your edit
Solar panels are only now starting to be a real alternative to fossil fuels. Right now, they aren't a homerun for saving the planet, but soon they will be. As we extend the lifespan, improve efficiency, and decrease production waste, the numbers look much better.

Just take this as a lesson to hold in your own wallet. If I were you, I would get a lawyer. Gather whatever proof you have, and start forming a lawsuit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:14:37
Ok, no *legitimate/peer reviewed/scientific* models.
Just looking at the first link: 
It claims that "Humans will be extinct in 100 years due to overcrowding, declining resources and climate change, according to a prominent scientist."
This is plainly ridiculous. First of all, projections of population max out at about 15 billion. The myth of exponential population growth has been demonstrated to be false. See Japan and Germany.
Good video, with sources in description: 
Also, the only natural resources that look likely to run out by 2100 are fossil fuels, which will most likely be unused by that time. Solar is already looking like a cheaper alternative for home owners in some areas.
And finally, while climate change will cause a lot of bad things to happen, if nothing is done about it, none of those things are extinction level events.
If you want to discuss this further, we're going to need to move away from discussing google searches, though. If you want to continue, please pick a specific model that you think is accurate, or form an argument on your own. I can't argue against all possible arguments, which is what I'm having to do right now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:29:31
That's not true. It might be the cause of a large scale change to the planet, but the human race has never been in danger from climate change. That's the kind of hyperbolic statement that turns people into climate change deniers.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:21:21
I think it's just a little disingenuous to claim that they are "blocking" Segwit, when Segwit wouldn't be able to go through, even if BU didn't exist. Segwit still has less than 40% of miners on board.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:44:43
What you mean to say is, BU isn't what you want bitcoin to be. There is no rational definition of bitcoin that includes the original setup of bitcoin and Segwit, while excluding BU.
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:26:38
Has anyone actually proven that they are able to do that? It doesn't make very much sense, if a random delay is being used.

Explicit disapproval is still just disapproval. 
And core nodes are a higher search result than BU nodes, so obviously there are more of them.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:55:13
You're kind of asking me to prove a negative. I believe that because there is no evidence that it is true. No model has ever predicted the extinction of humanity from climate change.
Climate change has a lot of negative effects that are real, but none of them are extinction level (at least not for humans).
If you would like to, feel free to spell out how climate change would cause a human extinction level event, and we can talk about it.

Therefor, this wallet was not "secure".
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:53:34
If anyone is attempting to twist this into meaning that the poster thinks BU is worse than core, please stop. You'll just look stupid.
Most bitcoin users don't know a damn thing about this whole scaling debate. If BU and core split off, the exchanges have made it clear that core will get to keep the name "Bitcoin" and the symbol "BTC".
BU would be at a disadvantage, because most users would see the two options and go with the one that they've heard of. They'll see BTU and say "what the hell is that? I just wanted to buy some bitcoins."
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:55:43
Because it's not a permanent solution, or at least that's the argument made. I won't get in to wether or not the argument is accurate, but I'll present it, so you can make your own informed decision (do your own research, and don't just read Reddit comments! That's not informed!).
Segwit does increase the transaction volume per block. Witness data takes up ~60% of the block, so taking that data out of the equation means you can fit 150% more transactions in each block (assuming everyone is actually using Segwit transaction).
However, the blocks would be effectively bigger than 1MB. The witness data is still needed to verify transactions, so nodes will still have to transmit and store the witness data. The witness data is 1.5x the size of the transaction data (1MB with full Segwit usage), so the total effective size of the block is 2.5MB. So, the argument goes, why not just raise the blocksize? **(I believe I have read some people contest this claim, but if they provided an adequate rebuttal, I don't remember it. If someone would like to provide a rebuttal, that explains why this argument isn't valid/accurate, I will edit this post to reflect that information.)**
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:29:25
I'm not sure what the legal ramifications would be, if a user demanded those coins.
If a court case fell in favor of the user, that would create a precedent for someone creating multiple hardforks, and continuously suing Coinbase, which could be quite a drain.
On the other hand, if Coinbase won, they could just keep any future hardforked coins, which might end up being worth something (say half the network goes through with the 2x and the other half doesn't).
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:18:39
It never will. Monero's privacy comes at a cost: massive transaction sizes. That would greatly exacerbate the scaling issues that bitcoin is struggling with, now.
Monero and bitcoin should be thought of as partners, not as rivals. Bitcoin can optimize for speed and/or volume, and monero can optimize for privacy. So long as it remains easy to exchange between the two, they both win.
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:55:55

Ending specific civilizations is very different than killing every human on the planet.
Also, again, that was thousands of years ago. Civilization had just been invented, and most people were nomadic or communal. The fall of Rome was not the fall of the people of Rome. They continued to exist, just as we would continue to exist, should our specific nations collapse.
So, unless you simply misspoke, we definitely do disagree.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:37:06
You should be able to recognize this yourself, but just to make sure, that is a very heavily biased evaluation of the situation.
Anyone who's using that much emotion to talk about the technical implementation of bitcoin, should not be used as a source of information.
Do your own research (not browsing Reddit), and figure out what you think on your own.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:17:11
That's a good point. That would probably be the outcome.

I'm not sure that's an accurate description of what's occurring.
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:01:32
Hardly. Just use bitcoin for transactions that you don't care about being private, and use monero when privacy is important.

Wow, a rational person. I hardly ever see any of those anymore.
For anyone who is unaware, there are two options to avoid a serious risk in the event of a fork.
1) sell your bitcoin before the fork
2) keep both coins after the fork
Choosing a side means rolling the dice. You might win out, but you might lose all of it. The above options pretty much guarantee that your value will remain stable (or as stable as bitcoin has ever been).

Exactly. Only 30% of exchanges don't support ETH to fiat. Far too small a percentage to do what you're claiming.
