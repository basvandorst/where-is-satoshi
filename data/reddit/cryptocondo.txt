Thanks and good luck.

Will re-tip to Sean's Outpost
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:39:54
No need to apologise as it is important to raise any issues now. Ths may not work out but hopefully it does and we can raise funds for Sean's Outpost while doing so. I am open to any questions or for anyone to come visit the property and view documentation/verification as need be.
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:03:26
I understand but it's not a raffle either. It is a contest with an entry fee (see skill question section). Will take what you said under consideration though for future postings and marketing.

Heart goes out to you. I've done something similar and it hurt when it was just 1 coin, can't imagine what 800 feels like.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:51:40
Also, I have no issues with passing all ticket entry fees daily on to a Sean's Outpost cold storage address to hold as escrow.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:15:03
It is not an illegal lottery and though it may be a foreign country to you it is not to others.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:28:04
Thank you. The typo was in the example and it has been fixed now.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:02:57
I am very open to this. But also I have offered to send on all ticket entry fees to a cold storage address held by Sean or another trusted party. Entry fees could be transferred every hour or when a limit is reached.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:41:29
It is not a scam.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:32:36
He just replied to my email and I've sent him the thread link so hopefully he can post soon.
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:48:47
Fair play to them.

The draw will be once the final currency block is solved which should be in 4 weeks or around the 10th of June:
The secrets are used to add more randomness to the equation and as well prevent people from cheating if they could somehow guess the block hashes and number of transactions within the final blocks as per

Will email Jason now with the thread link.
@_date: 2014-08-23 00:15:24
No, it wasn't a scam. Last block was only solved last Friday. All bitcoins tickets save the last one have been refunded and final one will be refunded shortly.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:24:14
If that is needed I am open to that and can change the contest address while still keeping existing purchases assigned to tickets. I've emailed Sean's OutPost about setting this up but am open to any well trusted community member being involved.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:42:46
If you are in Toronto you are more than welcome to come inspect the property and any documentation/verification you require. See the site to book a viewing.
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:38:32
Do not be sorry as you have every right to be concerned about your money. All bitcoin tickets were refunded last month though.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:35:02
Thanks and I wish you good luck. Please remember that if the minimum reserve is not met then all entry fees will be fully refunded and there is a skill question where required.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:31:42
Thank you. I am speaking with Sean's Outpost already about this and will keep you posted.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:16:22
Please read the site for all the contest details. The min reserve is set to less than the value of the property and the number of tickets required goes down as the price of BTC goes up.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:50:27
Thank you. Have fixed that now in the example.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:48:22
I have verified all my details with Jason from Sean's Outpost so if I do that then you will know where to find me.
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:00:31
I've been paying all my sub-contractors in btc for the past year or so and it's worked out great. But it's all tech guys so there isn't any explaining to do. I can't wait for the day though I get my first client to pay in btc.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:01:46


Don't be. It needs to be 100% correct. I forgot about the line below. Fixed now.
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:02:08
@_date: 2014-08-23 00:16:27
100% refund as per the rules on the site.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:32:56
I actually thought he was being sincere with the strikeout :)
