I pay zero fees when I'm paying for a coffee with my card, I almost never use cash and lots of businesses hate cash. Cash is dying out here in Sweden and even a small corner store will accept credit and debit.

Yes I have. But theoretical advances and solutions are not really that comforting as long as it stands as it is, since there is nothing concrete about it right now.

Well sure, but noone in their right mind would consider a currency that works slower and is *far* more expensive to use than a regular fiat card, despite it being more secure. IF(!) lightning network solves this then yes, it's way more credible. But right now it's completely useless as a currency.

The businesses here don't pay fees either. I guess your system is outdated.

Seriously though, can someone tell me why it's anything but a store of value? Transfer fees are through the roof and transactions either take hours or even days. Why would that be appealing to use as a currency? I'm not gonna chill by the register in my grocery store for 9 hours to confirm my payment.
Edit: Oh and one more thing. The energy consumption is not even funny, Bitcoin is the coal industry of the internet lol.

It's a scam dude. Check out the replies on their Twitter. Multiple coins have been disabled for withdrawal (not deposit though) for months with no updates. They recently suffered a huge hack, Google "Coinbene hack" and see for yourself.

That would be wise, hope you'll get your money out safely.

Does Coinbene allow cash deposit or why not use Binance or any other well-known exchange that has Ripple?
