You are awesome!

It’s essentially and Audi R8!

Makes sense, but maybe the steering wheel could be in the way.

When you say infrastructure, do you mean the bitcoin network itself or the exchanges?

The thing with a currency is that it needs to be stable. If not, people won't really use, no matter how secure it is. A currency also needs a standard, so one can't just switch from one cryptocurrency to another.  Not everyone has the time or resources to be able to accept or spend all forms of currency.

Goddammit! Lost again!

Holy fuck!!!

Time, ok. But what will happen with time? Do you mean time in combination with patience?
Patience, I'm not so sure about. I can be patient, but you can't just trust the masses to be patient. Call me cynical, but you can't just expect that out of people, especially ones who are after a quick buck.

I'm not saying it's impossible, but full time adoption might be a little slow. Hell, there are still people in NYC that only accept cash! If anything limited to the tech savvy. Even then take a look at cell phones, not everyone has a smart phone. As for me, it was only last year that I upgraded to one. 
The thing is, what is the real incentive to universally adopt bitcoin? Or any other digital currency? Is it supposed to replace our current one? Or exist alongside it? And if it is to replace an existing currency, people would be asking, why?

TL;DR this is why we can't have good things.

Yes, but speculation will always be there. You can't really stop it, especially in something that has no real regulatory body. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:20:22
Isn't it already decentralized? Or do you means decentralized exchange? If so, how does that work?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:13:41
I haven't heard of it. I just thought of it. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:23:52
You mean an Anonymous style organization? Even then, they still had their leaders.
I'm still under the thought that ideals are for an ideal world. And idealistically, people need to work together for this entire thing to work. I haven't hopes for bitcoin, but at heart, I'm cynical.

What about a bitcoin credit/debit card?
This way, a consumer may be able to pay without having to wait for a merchant to accept bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:14:10
But many people already treat it as a commodity. How do we change that? Especially with the way prices are going. 
Also, one random thought. If the prive stabilizes, wouldn't that increase adoption as a currency? In effect would that make the value go even higher?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:02:28
People want decentralized, but when it goes wrong they want control. How does that work?

I think the only moment it will reach 0 is if there is a major security breach. At that point you should be morally obligated to abandon ship. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:19:33
What would be the requirements to reach its potential?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:33:15
That's what I'm asking though. How does something that is in a free market reach stability?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:31:02
Would that alleviate the problem? I thought the other exchanges weren't as large as mtgox. Wouldn't they be more prone to this kind of load?
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:27:57
The next big jump is probably going to be when major exchanged adopt bitcoin. Whenever that will be.
