most people want money as a metric of their success or as a way of ensuring the absolute best for their future generations.

who can resist more easy money?  
 
 You don't have to be poor to want more of it.

interesting view

Didn't say they needed it for anything, but if you can make more money (ethically), why not do it?

But why should someone keep most of their money in btc then? Surely you don't need to transfer your life savings to distant family members often.
 
 
 Also, PayPal let's me gift money for free to family members. How is Bitcoin better?

I've sent over 40k through PayPal over the years to the randomest people in wierd countries and I've never had an issue. And if I did, there are 4 other payment services I could use.
   
Not an issue I really have.

So I should only bother with it if I distrust the government/banking system?

I have none, I'm just saying what I remember. I could totally be wrong though.

You know what a joke is, right?
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:00:26
it went past peak before the whole mtgox mess no? 
 
 at one point it was legitimately worth $1700
@_date: 2016-05-14 22:18:34
Yup, but that's assuming that they could all afford a computer and or game in a country where the average monthly wage is $300

I wish I were smart enough to find vulnerabilities :(. on the other hand, I've never had gold...
