That may well be the case, in which case the question is: do people switch because of they believe in the proposed change, or because they believe in who proposed it?
The answer to this matters tremendously. We must not fall into a benevolent dictatorship.

I assume that in the 18 hours that it took to get its first confirmation my 0-fee transaction had already propagated world-wide. My understanding is that I could have double-spent within that time frame, simply by adding a transaction fee to the new transaction.

Compared to the current banking system, Bitcoin *will* sell itself.
I do agree that we need to keep pushing for adoption by consumers and vendors, but bar any major technical issue in Bitcoin itself, I don't see smear campaigns being effective in the long term. The genie is out of the bottle.
@_date: 2014-03-12 07:59:54
If you sell something over the counter and don't wait for confirmations, it's actually trivial for people to rip you off.
How? I pay you for the goods but set a transaction fee of 0. That transaction will take anywhere between a few hours up to 2 or more days to get the first confirmation. You don't wait for the confirmation, so I take the goods with me, and as soon I get home I can just craft a low-level transaction that double-spends those funds (i.e. send them to myself at another address), but set a normal transaction fee.
You can bet that the second transaction will get into the blockchain within 10-20 minutes, and the original transaction (the one you didn't wait for) will immediately be discarded by every miner. I keep the goods and the money.
Edit: I'm saying this because it's what I almost did when I transferred a small amount without transactions fees. It took 18 hours to confirm. I almost considered double-spending it just to make it confirm faster.

I don't support renaming it, but trains do provide a good analogy for explaining why sometimes the first confirmation takes longer than the subsequent ones, especially for 0 fee transactions.
If you don't want to pay, you may need to wait for several trains to pass by until one lets you in for free. But once you're in, every stop is a confirmation.

Wouldn't it be possible to use online banking and transfer the funds to another BoA account before releasing the bitcoins? I'm sure the teller couldn't touch the 2nd account in order to reverse the cash transaction.
Same thing if you actually walk to an ATM and withdraw the cash before releasing the LBC funds. Just saying, might work.
Edit: yes the idea is that you'd use an account just for LBC, that can be emptied before each LBC release.

People on either side of the forks will quickly trade away the coin that they don't want, for the coin that they do want. That could actually happen quickly and painlessly within future multicoin wallets.
Everyone would end up holding about double the amount of coins, but with an overall similar total value, since each coin will be worth about half as much as before.
What happens from there onwards is anyone's guess.

I'm not sure about bitcoin (token), but I can see how IoT could benefit from a blockchain, and it all comes down to the need for privacy and having to trust the software that the IoT device runs at all times.
IoT devices should never "call home" for updates, instead they should build a "root of trust" that starts with signed FOSS software that is published on the blockchain (the blockchain becomes "home"). Transparency in software updates is key, and the blockchain can provide that. Hard to sneak-in backdoors when everyone is watching.
Of course, convincing manufacturers to make all their IoT software FOSS is another problem...

@_date: 2015-07-17 11:39:58
In a nutshell: It's just automatic distribution of value according to pre-defined rules set in hyper-linked configuration files.
An example, FOSS monetisation: say my electronics online store is configured to donate 2% of all sales towards the open source stack that powers it. The stack is defined in a VDP file that is attached to my bitcoin payment processor. When you buy a Raspberry Pi from my store with bitcoin, the 2% is split according to that VDP file. Some payees in my VDP file are actually links to other VDP files hosted in the various project's source repositories, in a network of file dependencies, all the way down to individual contributors of each project. That Raspberry Pi that you bought just paid around 1 satoshi to every developer of every software project that powers my store, including linux kernel developers.
The cool thing is when you get the calculator out and simulate what would happen if every e-commerce business that uses open-source donated 2% towards the stack.
This is just one use-case for VDP, but one that I'm particularly fond of.

Subsatoshi will probably use the Lightning network when payments accumulate to *above-satoshi* amounts, as they eventually make their way onto the actual blockchain.
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:56:54
How long is it?
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:48:46


The idea is for the VDP payment processor to immediately payout anything that can go directly on the blockchain. It's what happened for the hackathon award payment.
For dust and sub-satoshi amounts the original idea was to do some internal accounting and accumulate the individual micro-amounts for each payee until the amount is big enough to justify an actual on-chain transaction.
When the Lightning project was announced I thought it would be a good fit for "normal" (non sub-satoshi) dust transactions between VDP payment processors, so the value can "move" even before it can go on the chain.
