What's your issue with the delegated proof of stake that most dag coins use? I'd like to understand the pros and cons better.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:48:03
That's not really the issue. Proof of Work requires you to have influence over 51% of the computational power of the network to change the blockchain. Proof of Stake requires you to have influence over 51% of the total coins to change the blockchain. Both are prety effective in that sense. So that's not really where it has a problem (at least in my understanding). The issues are more subtle -- for instance it encourages chain splits. There are potential remedies for those issues as well but I'm not fully up to date on how well they handle it, hence the question.

The financial stake that people have in net neutrality is a lot smaller and a lot more abstract.
By comparison it seems like everyone knows someone who has a huge chunk of their personal savings in crypto at the moment.

Unlike in China, I think it will be increasingly difficult to impossible for democratic countries to ban bitcoin because of the popular opposition.
Few things motivate voters quite as much as having a serious financial stake in the outcome.

Hubs are not fundamentally bad, one hub is bad. Right now there are a few big exchanges in each region. Yes it is a degree of centralization, but they have to compete with each other, users can always move into or out of them as they see fit and it has had massive and, in my opinion, undeniable benefits in getting regular people on board.
100 or 1000 or 10000 lightning network hubs would act the same way. I don't see that as such a problem, especially given how lightning keeps those transactions trustless.

That's a good point, though it does present another question.
Let's say Amazon is taking payments through their channel. They receive payments from millions of people around the world and then convert those payments to cash (at least in the near future) on an exchange near their headquarters.
That would create a situation where customers in the US would be able to keep purchasing easily because they can use that same exchange so we've completed the circuit as intended. But customers outside the US (in this example) would exhaust their available lightning nodes quite quickly because no coin would be flowing back in the other direction.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on that possibility.
Even if that does happen, I'm not sure that it would be the end of the world because, if the LN really does lower fees to the anticipated degree, it would incentivize companies like Amazon to make sure that the network was functioning well with as many of its customers as possible, maybe encouraging it to cash out in many places around the world or support additional nodes on its own or, in an ideal world, try to pay suppliers around the world in coin rather than fiat to help complete the circuit that way.

I suspect the opposite: He wanted to live anonymously but still wanted posterity to remember him as the creator of bitcoin.  I think when the first big investigations into Nakamoto turned up other people, he got nervous that maybe he wouldn't be able to prove he was behind it when the time came so he started backdating blog posts.  It's a very human reaction, which makes it, for me at least, more believable.
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:53:26
I actually think the little details like him playing with his blog posts years later make it seem the most believable.  He seems like a guy who created something that became huge and wants to live anonymously now, but wants to be sure that posterity remembers him for what he did.
I think the other reports on supposed bitcoin founders spooked him and he started to worry that maybe he'd been preserving his anonymity too well and he would never get credit in the end, when he wanted it.

There are ZERO Israelis in Gaza, so probably not.
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:20:09


They were occupying it and then Israel chose to pull completely out of Gaza.  They razed 25 settlements and took every single solitary Israeli soldier out of Gaza.  The Palestinians there had elections and who did they elect to lead them?  An internationally recognized terrorist group that has since fired more than 10,000 missiles at Israel.  Hence the blockade.  
That's what the Israelis got for giving Gazans everything they were supposedly asking for - missiles.
They can occupy it again anytime they want, but they are desperately hoping that the Palestinians who live there will stop firing rockets at their homes and schools instead.  So far the giving-them-everything-they-are-asking-for strategy has failed terribly.
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:28:49
Sorry if I misinterpreted.  Many people on reddit seem to think there are still Israelis occupying Gaza so I thought you were one of the confused ones.  Nevermind.

I want to know if my view of the way Bitcoin transactions will work in the future is shared by others among you, if there is an expected method or if there are problems with what I suggest.  Thanks, here goes ...
Everyone will have three levels of Bitcoin storage.  The first and biggest will be the Bitcoin Bank (/exchange probably), which is just a wallet where your bitcoins are stored but with the important caveat that they are insured by the hosting company as well.  This gives it the same protection banks have today and thus, you keep your wealth there.  This is the most secure, is insured and holds the largest amount of Bitcoins.
Level two is your phone, which replaces your traditional leather wallet.  Your phone might have $1000 worth of bitcoin on it.  It is secured, not as much as the bank, but more than any online wallet.
Level three is your browser extension wallet.  You will only keep, say, $20 there, enabling you to do small things like tip or pay a cent to read an article at the click of a button.  This is the least secure so you keep the smallest amount of money there.
When you need to make a larger purchase, you transfer money from your cellphone to your browser wallet for immediate use.  Similarly you refill your cell phone wallet from your secure Bitcoin bank account.
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:53:23
He didn't mean ideological in the sense of *capitalism* vs *communism*. He meant it's a point reasonable minds can disagree on if they have slightly different opinions on the way Bitcoin should be used practically and what will help its advancement.

I don't know that it's fair to call it "cashing out". His bitcoin has risen in value so much that he's moving half to dollars. I think that would be better termed "diversifying" and it doesn't say anything about bitcoin's value as a currency. It says something about his financial literacy.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:01:11
That the banks waste energy too is not a good enough answer. We should talk about how to reduce the amount of energy the bitcoin ecosystem requires now, *before* it really takes off and energy consumption really skyrockets.
This is a valid point and it's a mistake to dismiss it out of hand.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:28:03
Good thing the cold storage (and every coin held by the exchange) is fully insured.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:15:44
Where can I read the actual report fundstrat put together?
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:57:03
I'm with you, it's a legitimate point -- bitcoin requires starkly increasing quantities of energy to function as intended and we have not really spent much time considering the implications of that or possible ways to improve the situation.
If this subreddit continues to dismiss any and all criticism out of hand, how can bitcoin improve?
To seriously consider a future that runs on bitcoin, we have to talk about the energy consumption issue. 'The banks use energy too' is not a good enough answer.

Are you talking about lowering transaction fees sometime in the future or right now?  Because right now wouldn't the coinbase or bitstamp fees associated with one side converting their payment from dollars to bitcoins and the other converting back to dollars mitigate any gains you'd have in avoiding credit card or paypal fees?
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:24:09
Sure, eventually there will be bitcoin banks, which will insure your deposits just like regular banks do right now.  Maybe it will even be your regular bank that does it.  That's what I expect at least.

On the other hand, you could make the argument that Esperanto is a better analogy for Bitcoin.  A single language built for mass adoption that would allow people to communicate quickly and easily over large distances.  It doesn't have much infrastructure, but it does have utility.

Unlike Cocaine, which as a product has inherent value, Bitcoins are a currency.  Their worth (just like the US dollar) is determined by the amount of faith people have in it as a reliable medium for transactions.  The most powerful government in the world saying that it's a scam, a criminal enterprise, unreliable or dangerous would cause a massive price drop because its reliability and its survival would be brought into question.

Good luck!  A currency that cannot be manipulated by governments should appeal to viewers from the countries you mentioned.  What is happening in Venezuela right now is a good example of the advantages of Bitcoin and advising them to use it as a safer store of wealth than their national currency would make a lot of sense right now.

The most worrying parts of it for me are these ...




This opens up two big concerns for me.  One, it sounds like there's a possibility Chinese banks will stop allowing transfers to btc exchanges, and two, I'm afraid this will ban Chinese businesses from using bitcoin.
Sure, individuals can still use it as a vehicle for speculation, but how can the bitcoin economy in China grow with those restrictions?

Good point.  If everyone is using Bitcoins, there is still a need for companies to lend out mortgages.  Most, if not all, of the traditional banking services remain viable.  Even storage of currency could remain the domain of the banks.  Personally I would feel safer with my paper wallet in a bank's safety deposit box.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:31:04
So roll it out slowly in techy areas.  It wouldn't cost so much to start accepting it in San Francisco area stores only for instance and you would still get the national headlines.  If it works there, spread it.  With Bitpay, the volatility doesn't have a big effect (you can charge prices in dollars, Bitpay will do the conversions for you and you'll receive dollars), so there's no reason you can't start small and scale.

If half the current bitcoin supply was lost, the price wouldn't double, because we would have no idea if they were lost.  It's impossible to tell the difference between someone saving bitcoins for a long time and someone losing them.  Perhaps after a few generations you could make assumptions.

Not bad but coinbase is actually the main US exchange right now, with Bitstamp (based in Europe) coming in second I believe.

Can you still purchase normally on Bitcoin (buy at the price listed and then it takes four days or so for the bank transfer, but you bought them at the original price)?  Or is all purchasing delayed purchases now?
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:50:01
Everyone else's coins would go up in value if we knew the number of lost bitcoins, but we never will.  As a result, I don't think the value could be affected.  At any given time the actual quantity of the currency will be completely unknown, we'll only know the amount that's changing hands.
I guess this is the way it is with gold, diamonds, Picassos, etc... -- the prices of which all seem to have some stability.
