I'm really bothered that there's an open quote, but no close.

This legitimately made me laugh.

So amazing! 9 steps with all sorts of words 99% of people don't know about, 10 minutes, and voila! Or paypal in 1 minute.
Don't get me wrong, crypto is more than likely the future... But this is still an awful experience compared to established payment methods.

"Guest checkout"...

Past behavior is not a predictor of future performance. Maybe it'll do it again, maybe it won't, but posts like these are just people trying to make themselves feel better about losing money (I'm in the same boat).

"Don't look at the thing I don't want you to see, look at the thing that 'proves' my point!"
ATH and Yearly lows are both stupid metrics. Look at the stability, and the prevalence of BTC's actual use as currency.
Edit: Thank you!

Ever tried to sort dates? Or search through something ordered to find a specific day?
I worked at a recording studio, and the archive had all of our recordings organized by date, labeled in yyyyMMdd format. Made it very quick to find the chunk of recordings for the year you're looking for, then narrow it down to month, then day.

In what universe are coins not cash?

Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin to be usable currency, and not just an investment vs federal currency?

Another Bitcoin article that's just speculation from a site known for posting tons of articles that are very nearly propaganda... And we wonder why most people don't take Bitcoin seriously.
