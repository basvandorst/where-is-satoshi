I don’t think under $10k is bearish. But will scare the new comers.

If you have been following stock market and trump tweets about China trade deals in the past few months you would know.

Yes, Of course. It seems like a natural growth and is very good. It was just an observation, wasn’t pointing out anything wrong with the current growth. 
P.S. it’s also good for my nerves. LOL.

The first one or the second one. Lol. 
I think first time we hit $15k will be crazzzyyy. 
And the second time we hit $15k after the dip will be peaceful to watch.

2 types of bull run. 
1. When bitcoin crossed $12k a few weeks ago everyone was like $12k is here we are going to the moon. 
2. Today bitcoin crossed $12k again and  nobody seems to care. Not even the newbies who bought in a few weeks back. 
It’s crazy how easily people are getting used to the roller coaster ride of bitcoin.
