That's what LTC did. It's been going strong for Almost 8 years now.

And currently I can sell a litecoin for like $75.00 so it's definitely not worthless.. ��

LTC uses pretty much all the code from BTC so it's anything but centralized &amp; it's been around since 2011. Soon it'll have better privacy than BTC too. I'm no LTC shill but it would be nice to not have to mix your coins.

I had the patience for it. All last year Bitcoin was on discount. Where were ya?....
Do not fomo in... especially after a $3,000.00 dollar increase. Spend a couple hundred bucks so you have some skin in the game then just do a weekly buy. Good luck

Why not connect your bank account and incur the lowest fees possible?

Although some of your comments may be correct... I don't think they deserve to be attacked. Blockchain.info is an OG in this space and can be accredited with onboarding thousands of users into this space. Sure it would be great if they implemented segwit but do not act as if they're out to get Bitcoin or do not support it....they obviously do.

Pretty sure the Bitcoin pizza guy discovered a new/faster way of mining back in the day. so he was finding way more blocks than other miners for awhie. I'm sure he's doing just fine.

Okay... So you wait a week or two and then transfer the btc to your personal wallet... Don't use a debit card to buy BTC the fees are just stupid
