Beautiful mockups.  I like the simplicity and design of both the app and the presentation of your mockup.  As a mobile developer myself, I get tons of people who come to me with ideas, and even have worked with some teams, but they are usually much less thought out.
This would be ideal for someone like me to flesh out and put into code.  Looking forward to using it some time - I'm assuming you have developers ready to help build it, but if you need someone, PM me!

The thing is, you're not going to convince me.  I hate Apple as a company, but I love their hardware and OS.  I'm not really a fan boy, I'm just a software developer and musician that wishes to use the best tools (in my opinion) around.

thanks - will keep an eye out.  was planning to just hold on to them anyway, so if I must eat the loss I will, but fingers crossed that this doesn't happen and I can get some a bit cheaper :)

if it hits that, i'm gonna have to disregard all the 'don't quit your job' posts...

Thanks for taking the time to do this.  I was searching for this information just the other day and was unable to find any detailed resources.

Ha maybe we can tilt the results.  I voted "yes", and the percentage went from 26% to 27%

I had to wait a week on my coinbase orders at first.  Got the coins as expected.  Not sure why it takes so long, but its not necessarily a scam..

no.. now i don't have to make the switch since i can use bitcoin with my iphone..

I don't care about treating an attachment as a file.  I can see its contents, and I also receive email on my computer if I need to use it as a file.
But thats not the point is making.  Apple makes products for people like me who use a phone primarily as a phone or browser.  I don't need it to replace the functionality of my laptop.

I'm a software engineer with an emphasis in web and mobile development, although I've only taken a real interest in bitcoin in the past month or so..
What bitcoin software tools or web services don't exist right now that would be useful or game changers?  I feel there is room for a ton of innovation in this area but I don't have a deep enough understanding of what goes on 'behind the scenes' and what the boundaries are of what's really possible
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:41:31
Agreed.  Also, I've noticed that in general the media seems to be overplaying the whole anonymity aspect of bitcoin in the first place.  It seems that while its possible, anonymity is actually decreased by the existence of the block chain..

My bad.. didn't realize you had to pay since I can view this from my work network... and after going back to copy and paste the article, I can no longer see it.  
TL,DR: Bitcoin might turn out to be worthless, but it might create history and make you rich.  Thumbs up for investing!

I had been trying to buy it since it was at $60, but between Mt.Gox verification queue taking so long and Coinbase not allowing me to buy, I couldn't get in until $200.  And it was hitting all time highs every day for a while.. why assume that it was going to stop there? I wanted to have some to have some, and $400 was the most I was willing to risk for a potentially large payoff.
TL/DR: I cannot see into the future

Yeah, this is a great argument for us iOS users.  I have a masters in CSC but I still prefer my iPhone and Macbook because they are simply easier to use.  Yes, I have to put up with some Apple bullshit, but overall I run into way fewer issues than I used to on Windows/Android.  Albeit, its been a few years...
