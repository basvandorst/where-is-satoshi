Blockchain Revolution is an international best seller. What have you written lately that's topped that?  You must be Einstein if you consider these people to be dumb. Perianne is a force to be reckoned with. Her work with the Digital Chamber of Commerce is top notch. Blockchain is NOT all about coding. Plus, for our previous event we had Peter Todd (bitcoin core developer) so the focus of our next May event is less technical and more about the other elements of this industry. Stop hating and start contributing!

The Indian bitcoin community is actively working together (see DABFI - digital assets and blockchain foundation of India) to ensure that this doesn't happen. We are actively working with the committee alongside our law firm (Nishith Desai and Associates) to not only educate the general public but also politicians so that the future remains a bright one for bitcoin and blockchain tech in India. We are also working closely with similar trade associations around the world to ensure that we take all the right steps. It's not easy.
