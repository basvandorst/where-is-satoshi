The internal transactions and trades work off of an internal database and not the blockchain. All the exchanges operate this way--otherwise the network would be clogged with thousands of transactions from trades.
What you're seeing is normal beside the fact their system wasn't synced with the public blockchain due to what they claim is the tx malleability bug.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:41:40
It specifically tied transactions and amounts to Gox. If Gox were to move 10k here and 10k there with the API down we'd be none the wiser.

MtGox disabled their transaction API so Coinsight is now essentially blind. It will take much more effort now to track Gox's coin movements. This is not by accident.
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:22:11
Coinbase is very reputable. I've used them for awhile now.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:01:25
I'd be interested to see which coins are still 'intact', which can likely be determined by having the original or greater balance of the coin. That's still not a 100% guarantee, but a decent approximation.
Edit: Better yet--check each address for any spends and drop those from the list.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:23:13
I posted about this elsewhere. This is not a 60/40 split. That would mean 30k is split into 18k and 12k--which didn't happen. The Gox splitting also waited for 6 confirmations before continuing--this did not.
This is an early adopter shifting coins for security reasons.

Bashing a technology and software engineering task that you couldn't fathom of understanding or undertaking smells of a non-contributing community member.

It's two public addresses--he's fine.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:36:33
Gox reused transaction inputs so the amount 'looked' a lot bigger . Here is my statement on the 530k: 
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:42:28
Last activity on these addresses is February 6th, 2014. Were these tracked in Gox's transactions output API, were these stolen, or are they unrelated to Gox or any theft (private whale)?
Hard to tell at this point.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:01:41
If Karpeles stepped down and a new trustworthy CEO was brought in that would calm a lot of fear. It would take time to build their reputation back up, but it's a start. The Gox employees need better leadership.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:56:00

@_date: 2014-03-10 21:54:41
He hasn't moved those coins in years. Gox's customer data leaks and he starts splitting them up. The timing is pretty impeccable and I would say almost for sure it's for security reasons. 


No one mentioned planting bugs in his house? For awhile there Bitcoin offer security through obscurity. With his address out in the open that security is gone. I would do the same thing--split up the pile and move it off-site to secure locations.
@_date: 2014-03-25 05:00:42
I know you feel that way and I bet a lot of Bitcoiners do as well. The problem is governments have no sympathy for such privacy and will go after BTC-e sooner or later.
I'm very pro-privacy, but if stolen Bitcoins are moving through that exchange, which without KML is very likely, some responsibility needs to take place before global acceptance. There has to be some structure in place so if Wall Street jumps in there is some accountability if their funds are stolen. Why would they risk the capital otherwise?


Not initially and it was enabled later. I'm almost certain investigations are taking place behind the scenes much like what happened with Silk Road--that investigation and seizure came out of no where.

You can turn off automatic restarts on system failures. I'm not sure where this setting is located on Win7, but Google should point the way. That may at least give you a BSOD with a system error that can be traced.
My next step would be running a memory test to check the RAM for any issues. memtest86 is bootable and does a nice job.

I hope you understand that standards across any industry are extremely varied and in some companies I worked for had completely different approaches.

Gavin is a core developer on the Bitcoin protocol. That does not mean he gets to be slaved out to businesses trying to implement software based on the open source work. The businesses need to hire their own Bitcoin developers.
Had MtGox hired competent software engineers from the start it's likely this 'tx malleability hack' wouldn't have even progressed to this point if that's even what's behind their mess.

It might be better than that. From the Crisis Deck: 
624,408 BTC (Customers)
+ 120,000 BTC (MtGox)
- 80,208 BTC (From banned or suspicious accounts)
Assuming Gox eats all its losses that would be 200k / 544k = 36.7%. My guess is that they will try to skim off more by doing a claims process. Thieves or suspicious users will forfeit balances during that time. Some of the accounts haven't been used in over 2 years so those may be forfeited as well if no one steps up for a claim.
Edit: With the new Gox announcement the figure is more like 202k / (750k - 80k) = ~30.16%

I'll venture a guess. Before the judge / court signs off on any rehabilitation effort to bring Gox back to life they need an independent security audit to prove the system is secure.
I would say this is a very risky job to take from a security firm's perspective. They would need to go through all the spaghetti code, backend, database, etc. and sign off that it is secure. If that happens they then put Gox back online and it could be immediately hacked with some zero day exploit or bug that was overlooked. The security firm then looks like a fool and loses its reputation.
Mark is more concerned about liquidation of his company than finding where the missing Bitcoins went. He wants traders to dig him out of this mess, but the volume is going to be sickly low if Gox does come back online. I have no idea how he plans to build confidence unless he finds more than 200k BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:32:06

@_date: 2014-03-20 15:26:48

It depends on the 'age' of coins. If we take Gox at their word then 140 million BTC days / 850k BTC = ~164 average days since those coins were last transacted. 
This makes sense since the hot wallet coins would be young and the cold wallet coins (likely a great amount) would likely be over 1-2 years since last transacted.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:27:01

Think about it. What you're saying makes zero sense. Gox and Karpeles have *physical* access to the servers. If they did not have control they could unplug the goddamn thing from the Internet, fix the problem, and bring it back online.

I'll try to clarify what I'm thinking in my head versus what I wrote:
Much like the war on drugs the government will confiscate, destroy, feed the public a bad image of it, and rope in other countries to combat it.
Now that didn't destroy illegal drugs at all, but imagine if that happened to Bitcoin today. The system as we know it now would be destroyed and pushed underground where it may survive in various ways, but always be suppressed. To me killing the mainstream aspect of it seems very much like 'destroying growth'.

Someone here linked to the block that spurred the 138 million bitcoin days destoyed:
I followed one of the 4k transactions back and it originates from the 400k wallet. It looks, to me, like someone transferred varied amounts of coins that last moved since 2011.
One of the final 4k BTC address designations: 
They all exhibit the same weird behavior. Sending a small amount to the 4k sender  address, getting that received back, then the full amount of 4k BTC being received. Is this how the txt malleability bug wold be executed? If so almost all the transactions in that block with a high number of bitcoin days destroyed are the hacker(s) at work.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:46:28

Total: 36 addresses = 146,119.9974 BTC
This 150k was split off from a larger 400k address (that found is owned by Gox) on January 27, 2011. On March 1, 2011 the 150k started to split. This was 5 days before the sale of MtGox to Karpeles from Jed McCaleb (who still owns 12% of Tibanne) was announced on March 6, 2011. Most of these coins last moved in December 2013 (it caused the big spike of 134 million bitcoin days destroyed on the 21st). So someone still had control 4 months ago.

MTGox FAQ claims they are now processing fiat withdrawals from 4 weeks ago.

The BitcoinBuilder transactions take place at 11PM PST according to Josh (they are done manually). If these transactions are way outside that scope of time I'd assume these are not related to BitcoinBuilder.

I traced the 150k using the visual tree: 
~~113k~~ ~146k of the initial amount remains split into amounts just less than 5k BTC that occurred in Dec 2013--untouched since. 
The ~~37k~~ ~4k unaccounted for was split in way too many tx's to follow and into the 423k address. ~~Exactly 10k went to the 423k address and ~27k was split into micro amounts. I'm guessing these were used for withdrawals and are no longer in the Gox wallet system.~~ 
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:25:01
It's no secret these are Gox's coins. All of the transactions from their API are graphed:

They recently cut off access to the output tx API, but you can see when they grabbed this cold wallet and plopped it into their hot wallet. Go to the 'All' view on the graphs.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:54:05
By 'wallets' they mean BTC, USD, YEN or other currency balances. They all show up. At this point Gox would remove the login if it was fake.
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:52:02
Sure seems like a witchhunt to me. Whether they're core developers or not people are allowed to be initially mistaken without having it thrown in their face. I'd say he followed up well once he saw more compelling evidence and postulated about the hot wallet structure, which was news to me.

@_date: 2014-03-21 22:24:32
So? I'm not arguing the point I simply gave a figure. If a country wanted to destroy it they'd simply make it illegal and encourage others to follow. It would look pretty childish to try and destroy it by playing in the network.
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:32:23
I'm surprised McCaleb hasn't been subpoenaed by one of the many lawsuits going on. Even if Karpeles plays dumb about this 150k address McCaleb might know why it was split or at least say, "Yep those private keys were handed over to Mark in the sale."

The Coinbase price calculation adjusts in near real-time with price fluctuations on Bitstamp. The Bitstamp price has been fluctuating by $5 within a minute lately so I don't see this as abnormal. 
Late last year when the price was skyrocketing I would have to continually update my buy quantity before the buy was accepted.
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:53:06
It doesn't quite work that way. You can't just write, "Denied - we feel it's sloppy code" especially if it passes unit / integration tests. If these tests don't exist (very likely) then that would be a valid reason. Their job is also to make recommendations on how to fix all the problems found.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:12:52
That's all someone needs now; get issued Goxcoins to have some fuckhead hacker steal those too.

The 200,000 BTC was moved repeatedly in the hot wallet structure so it 'looked' like more. When the API was up it was also confirmed that many tx's reused inputs and were eventually rejected / declared invalid by the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:46:15
Technically, yes. The blockchain would have to be forked with the help of the mining pools. Personally, I think it is a bad idea since that open's Pandora's Box--do something like this once and then we may rely on it in the future or cause more harm than good.
Edit: Fuck you downvoter. It IS possible, but extremely dangerous from many angles.

Just so everyone is clear--Berkshire was a textile manufacturing company until Buffett bought it. He then turned the company into a holding company and started acquiring more assets and companies with it.
So to say it is 126 years old doesn't mean much since the textile manufacturing portion is long gone and all that remains is the basic 'shell' and the name.

BitPay or Coinbase have the option of buying lower-priced BTC from their merchants with their fiat reserves, or dumping it on an exchange to cover any volatility loss. Where their thresholds are is anyone's guess, but they have many experienced traders on their payroll monitoring the market.

My reply comment, that you're trying hard to rip apart, was in reference to code only and not other areas.


A unit test for log in against non-uniform characters, buffer overflow, SQL injection, a bunch of spaces (hint: the recent Xbox Live login bypass found by a 5 year old). I include things like this in my unit tests where applicable, but maybe my standards are much higher than yours.


This isn't a coding standards audit. If the shit works--it works. Spaghetti code will certainly slow them down, but I've yet to come across code I couldn't untangle given enough time. If the the reverse engineering cost was determined to be higher than re-writing from scratch then that approach was taken and could certainly be recommended.
Here is a basic real-world problem that was caught on an audit that I've encountered. A contractor from India made this mistake:
The firm started by logging networks calls and running through the basic functions of the application. The auditor notices the session token is embedded in the URL for a HTTPS POST. In the report this is mentioned. The auditor was provided with a full copy of the source code beforehand and went and identified the class and line where the problem occurred. We added a condition to our unit test to force a compile failure if the token query parameter was attempted to be used in a network call, and had our web services team disable the session query parameter on their end.

It's not following the 60/40 splitting like the Gox hot wallet. Whoever is doing this is also not waiting for 6 confirmations before continued splitting.

There's a lot of confusion floating around concerning  OKCoin is actually licensing their exchange technology to Sunlot in the event their plan is approved. It does not appear they will be submitting an alternate rehab plan to compete with Sunlot's.

Looks like 75 years if writing to it a few times and storing. A lot less with heavy read/write operations.

No. They've only split twice and confirmations are stacking up with no additional movement.
Edit: 51k chunk just split again. This is going at a much slower pace than the 180k splitting. I watched one split after only 3 confirmations, which tells me this might be a manual process.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:59:59
This picture is also old. People were sending more BTC to the coin showing the public address. The museum staff were getting worried that if the coin's value continues to shoot up then someone really might try to steal it so they flipped it front-facing.
I don't have the link, but there is a long discussion on bitcointalk.org where they listed the public addresses for the Casascius coins in this museum. Last I looked one coin had over double the original amount.

Check the Jerry the Robot blog. Gox fixed a typo in the Underlying HTML. They (Jerry) noted they will try to curb warnings for things like this in the future.

Where was he 'completely' wrong? He speculated they were being put into a Gox hot wallet. This is true. Gox then moved them from the hot wallet to cold storage. I think you have your facts twisted.
