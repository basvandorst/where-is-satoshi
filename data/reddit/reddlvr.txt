Just piling up on being turned off by Kraken. Was trying to do level 3 verification today and had to try literally 10 times sending the images of docs for it to go through. Cloudfare errors. 
It was not going through getting a blank page, when I realized my jpegs were bigger in pixel count than what they allow. I had to resized them down and after a few tries it went through.
If this doesn't work well, I can imagine actual trading will be bad too.

The value of fiat doesn't go down. Stays the same (assuming the current financial system doesn't collapse). 
Let's say a cup of coffee cost today $3 at todays prices 0.000290BTC.  If fiat stays the same dynamics, with inflation it will be $4 in the future... Assuming Bitcoin maintains it's credibility as exchange currency,  bitcoins by then will be way more scarce, so the assigned mental value to a cup of coffee will be way less than 0.000290BTC, and as a result BTCUSD will be way higher than it is today.
Fiat's are artifically inflationary (central banks print money out of nothing to cause inflation), Bitcoin is deflationary by design. This conflict very likely means BTCUSD will go higher if BTC survives as a credible asset (no scalability problems, no security problems ......)

Isn't this the same as stealing? Many people may want to hoard BTC for over 20 years.

If there's any significant amount of value on BTC it will go on people wills.

Also, bitcoin supply is hard capped at 21 million which if it survives as asset means bitcoin prices will be deflationary ==&gt; fiat exchange will go up up, regardless of the health of fiat currencies.
