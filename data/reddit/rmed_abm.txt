I've never been scared to lose all of my money. Doesn't mean I don't feel bad when a huge crash happens though.

I recovered my wallet.dat a few weeks ago and still knew my password. I think I know how you feel right now :')
And those were bitcoin I mined. 5 years ago. with 5870s.

How about "kids" like myself who mined btc before it even hit the 100$ mark?

Riddles? :')
As far as I know it's impossible to do something while at the same time not doing that same thing.
Just anecdotal evidence though, maybe I'm not trying hard enough.

I occasionally sell 0.3 btc and throw the money in one of those forex things. Then I use 0.2 to buy with 1:25 leverage once it's close to a support and sell when it's gone up 20%.
Had 3 friends do it with 200$ when btc hit 11.5k, told them I'd eat half the losses. They've made around 1000$ now. Sold off half and bought 250$ worth of btc, 125 in ether, 50 in ripple and 50 in iota.
The rest is still on the investment platform.

Well, it's highly unlikely it won't go up in the future. It would make no sense for it to only go down from now on.
I mean, it's going up and down every second.
Technically correct. The best kind of correct.

congratulations to you too :)

Random claims? Fairly certain he's correct actually. It's highly unlikely they do if they don't. And it's equally unlikely that they don't while they do.
