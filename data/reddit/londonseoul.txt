I think it *can* be smart if you made your money and disappeared. It *is* silly to hang on convinced that Bitcoin is going to take over the world despite all the evidence and expert advice to the contrary. It is all about probabilities and it is a big gamble currently.

This is why it is regarded as speculation and not investing. The problem is cryptos are so new that even the so-called experts have still have no real idea of what is going on. Hell, standard economists are basically rolling a dice anyway, so with an area such as crypto you can multiply that uncertainty. Best of luck to you and your investments though. The good thing about this is that a lot of people have learnt a lot and are going to be wiser moving forward. I think we will see lots of interesting innovation in this area in the next decade as so many people have now got the finance bug that wouldn't have before crypto blew up.

Blockchain has been around for quite a while and its uses are hyped quite a lot. It is an interesting technology but its uses are not as revolutionary as it is often made out. [It has severe limitations]( and that is why people doubt the value of Bitcoin. If the fundamentals didn't change, we need to explain why Bitcoin suddenly shot up. It wasn't the technology, it was massive speculation. It is entirely possible it will drop back down again. On the other hand, it could skyrocket. The fact is though, it will not be as dependent on the technology as you think.

Hobbes is taken as one of the founding thinkers on sovereignty. He said this:








This is generally regarded as the ability to control currency within the realm. It has been developed greatly since then of course as a concept. Just look at the opposition to the Euro for the importance control of the currency to sovereignty.

In a nutshell from ETX Capital: "The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren’t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious."

This is one aspect of Bitcoin I just don't understand why people are so excited about (edit: I do: greed). When corporations do it everyone complains yet when it is the ordinary person who might be able to hide their wealth people start shouting about freedom from oppressive governments. I absolutely want governments to control and regulate crypto currency as I want people to pay taxes for public services. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:49:48
I am interpreting ideological commitment different to you here. Krugman seems to be making a rational argument as to why fiat has more value. I mean ideological commitment as attaching a value to a coin due to some ideological position about what it represents. With Bitcoin this is perhaps libertarian values or even anarchism. When people express their support for the dollar it is in real world institutions, state power, etc. Whereas support for Bitcoin is often (not always) in the realm of Utopian political ideas. That was my point.
Edit: He actually alludes to this point at the end of the article (although he is using a bit of hyperbole:


@_date: 2018-02-05 06:39:30

I mean that people are confused by the drop, but it is true that the real question is why it shot up so quick. It seems like there was manipulation going on and then that created a mania for crypto. This mania went viral and it had to cool off at some point. There is real value there, but it could be 1k or 10k. No one really knows. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:10:38
I was thinking about posting about this actually. These people seem like they are religiously committed to Bitcoin and to someone who is interested in it as a phenomenon they use similar arguments to the religious. The discussion is not about reality but about what Bitcoin is in their heads and how it is almost a Utopian project. While any finance expert who warns against crypto is labelled a shill just like a religious person would label someone a heretic. It is an interesting thing to see. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:13:51


Nearly everyone I have spoken to in real life about Bitcoin is clueless about it, including the people who own it. This is one of the big reason the price is *likely* inflated. People are speculating on a currency while thinking it is a long-term stock but they are not really clear on what the assets of the company are in terms of real value (which is always in dollars). It is fascinating to see. I am not saying this is everyone at all (you are probably much better informed) but most of the herd are clueless and got caught up in the buzz.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:34:38
I bet people who have normal stocks (most people see Bitcoin as a stock investment) don't scream "We need to HODL, we must HODL! Stand with me!" They don't they just do what makes financial sense, and if that means sell they sell. This tells you that Bitcoin is not really functioning as a rational market at all.

What are your thoughts on national sovereignty and taxation? Could Bitcoin signal the end of the nation-state? Taxation and minting coinage are two of the key elements of sovereignty. It seems to me like crypto is another sign of hyperglobalisation which is weakening the nation state. I don't know if that is good or bad. I am an internationalist myself. But it seems that states will have to adapt massively to these changes. Do I blame states for trying to retain control of finances within their jurisdiction? Of course not. I think some of the arguments about the values of Bitcoin are a bit on the idealist side and don't consider the political ramifications in a global, neo-liberal economy. The nation-state and central banks are not the cartoonish villain they are sometimes portrayed as. In the same way, Bitcoin is not the saviour some people would have us believe. Certainly interesting times ahead.

Fair enough. I should not have said no one has an ideological attachment to fiat. I did not know about Krugman and I was being admittedly being hyperbolic. I was trying to point out that there is a strong tendency, as seen in the OP here, to attach ideology and beliefs to Bitcoin in a way that is not seen in other areas. The religious aspects of Bitcoin have been noted elsewhere. It is not reflected to the same extent or degree in other areas of investment. It is reflected in the way the OP here argues for a return to the purity of the ideology and that is why I imply it is a Utopian project. It is interesting to see. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:16:48
I was thinking about this yesterday. For Hobbes, the ability to raise money was one of the cornerstones of sovereignty. And looking at the EU and elsewhere, control of the currency is still regarded as essential to sovereignty. A world of cryptocurrency completely outside of state control would seriously limit the ability of governments to control their economies. This is another stage in hyper-globalisation which was already seen with mass immigration and neo-liberal trade. Of course there are differences, but I think we have no idea of what effects a truly global crypto currency could have on national sovereignty. It is an interesting situation. It seems like at some level it would increase insecurity, while also providing immense opportunities, which is a trend that we are seeing worldwide in other areas. 
Edit: This is what Hobbes claimed, generally taken as currency being central to sovereignty (and it has been developed since then):








@_date: 2018-02-02 09:43:23
True. Even most people saying they are ideologically committed to Bitcoin are lying. Most people couldn't give a toss about it until the bubble started blowing up. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:14:59
Definitely a fair point to raise. As much of the mining is in countries like Russia and China, I wonder how the drain on energy is also affecting locals in the area. It seems such a massive drain on energy could have grid-wide impacts. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:38:09
It is interesting how Bitcoin is as much about ideological commitment and faith as about economics. I think that is what makes this phenomena stand out from past trends. Of course, all investors should have faith in what they invest in, but it's interesting how Bitcoin has developed a community and almost a movement behind it. You are right, the test will be how well that community stands strong in the tough times. I think that again emphasises its faith-based nature. All economics is like that to some degree though.

@_date: 2018-02-03 02:24:40
Krugman is ideologically committed to a strong currency and that's about it. He thinks that a strong state, central bank, institutions, etc, help provide that. But this is not the same as seeing fiat as representing an ideological value of a Utopian political vision. These are different and that is what people are pointing out with Bitcoin. It is the difference between being a pragmatist and being an idealist. Your comment about supporting fiat as being akin to wanting the government to control our behaviour is the perfect example of that. It's akin to the libertarian line that if you support taxation you support theft.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:55:33
I agree. I also think that even though the central banks would be looking after their self-interest, it is important that nation states can retain control over the currencies used within their borders. Having said that, I am interested to see what role crypto takes in the global economy. I just don't think it is good for states to lose the power of taxation over wealth and currency controls in their economies.
