Mom joke in Bitcoin subreddit? Seriously?
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:50:56
I agree. This year is full of surprises for BTC industry and this conference will become a perfect ending.
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:44:59
I agree, paypal is pointless if you are using bitocoin.
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:50:17
Not really. Probably just some redditors who are strapped for cash. Got the idea, shared it on reddit. Profit.
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:27:29

Nice try, Google. Nice try!

Poor bastards can't face the truth! 
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:47:14
Luckily so, if it wasn't inflationary at the start, it would mean the creator of bitcoin would own 100% of them! and it would be worthless. Satoshi gave us the chance to mine some of our own the first couple of years of bitcoin. And of course there's going to be inflation. But unlike the dollar and other fiat, the inflation in bitcoin will end. In fiat, inflation worsens over time, in bitcoin it lessens over time.

Using a bash command line is a kind of a mainstream nowadays
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:35:04
Seems that fiats became a hate-target nowadays
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:12:15
Looks like a miracle, yeah? Can't believe that Dell did that
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:01:17
In the days of the Internet, you know, before SOPA, TPB never got such a huge BTC donation
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:06:15


Don't agree. This subreddit and Satoshi proofs that Mankind is ready. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:14:29
I don't think that "lose" is a correct word. Bitcoin won't lose them. Am i right? 
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:33:14
We can use debit and credit system even with Bitcoin. Why not? 
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:46:21
Yes, there are between 1-2 million unique coinbase wallets and 99% of these are only US clients. Extrapolating the different exchanges there are at least 4-5 million bitcoin users right now.
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:33:14


Wow wow wow, slow it down. Not everyone is a Bitcoin expert. This status is yours. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:02:10
London is actually not in the middle but close to it. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 13:14:31
Yes it can. E.g. it can show you a message of how much of your posts were deleted
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:11:37
The diagram is simple and shows us the reality. Thx you! 
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:46:26
The data wasn't even accurate 6 months ago either as coinbase passed 1 million back in feb and most bitcoin user live outside of the US. This would indicate that conservatively 3 million was the approximation back in Feb.

If you want to learn something about this amazing conference you should just google it.
By the way, American Bitcoin Conference, witch is placed in Chicago is quite interesting and very usefull but only if you are looking for some real BTC news.

Bitcoin subreddit is about to make Imgur accept bitcoins... because the only pic service which users of Bitcoin subreddit use is... Imgur
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:54:17
