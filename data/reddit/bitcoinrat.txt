Thanks Guys , much appreciated

certainly good news for Bitcoin ( but I'm still curious as to why they suppressed it ? )
this is the "link' on their site

excellent Bruce  ... call him out !

I have a far more optimist view of the future of humanity I guess .... I believe people will take back control. This current Banksters cabal is historically quite recent - and wont last the next huge global crash which is on its way !

 I am actually waiting for an acknowledgement from PwC as to why they have removed it ( good journalist etiquette ) If they dont reply in 48 hrs i will publish 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:45:03
I'm working on this right now ... should be publishing in 48hrs
have been in email communications with him personally and have asked him to to verify that he has "no connection whatsoever with 'marc novus' or has allowed any of his writing to be used by any third party "  - waiting his response.

Mark Williams ( from Boston Uni ) who has spent the last year dissing Bitcoin will be shitting himself ( its only 5 mins from his office !! )
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:44:41
read my earlier blog on his writings .. someone who writes 25 posts a months - all critical of bitcoin - is staking A LOT ! ! 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:09:40
you write


Well, we will see. I'm not going to bother to reply to your ill-informed diatribes any more.  just to say, if you think that 'proceeds of crime in cash are traceable' - just tell me why there are currently some 1.3 trillions in money-laundered cash floating around the world as a result of illegal drugs and arms deals ? ( not my figures - United Nations Investigation ) , that's over 20 times the entire supply of Bitcoins.
coming back to your 'no chance in hell' that Bitcoin will be mainstream , get back to me on twitter in two years - if youre right, i'll eat humble pie .. in public .. but will you,  if you are wrong ?

I think he has 'Bit-o-phobia' 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:17:44
of course , I wasnt trying to say that anyones bitcoins are not accessible
but the whole point of the cartoon is that .. the rules of War with Guns .. has changed!  
Crypto-warfare will be totally different than anything that has gone before. nobody can predict where it will go, but it will certainly change the traditional balance that "power" comes from military mite

There is certainly a lot going on below the surface and the shadowy identities and motives of the  "bad actors' that are publishing against Bitcoin ( and that's not a 'conspiracy theory' - its supported by the facts that are slowly coming out) 
I am currently checking with sources about a recent ebook published on amazon
"Beyond the Bitcoin Hype: An Introduction to Bitcoin and Why It Will Fail"  -  by Marc Novus (14 February 2014) - Kindle eBook 
No-one within the bitcoin community has ever heard of a "marc novus" , and a google search shows this is the only reference to 'marc novus' ! ! very suspicious.
What is even more suspicious is that the phraseology and writing structure have a remarkable resemblance to the postings of Mark Williams ? 
anyone with a basic knowledge of Latin will know that "Novus" is the Latin for "new" and that mark is spelt "marc' in Latin literature  
I will keep everyone informed of feedback I get on this.

The Rat is with you all  ... we will not fail,  "we are bitcoin"

Many Thanks

hi Bob - i'm sure they will certainly try. The best hope is that Bitcon has such a momentum now that before the 'anti-bitcoin vested interests' can get themselves organised properly one of the 'big boys' may feel they can steal a competitive advantage by adopting it. in either event, its going to be a very interesting 2014 !  
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:32:03
thanks for your comments. I guess i'm just trying to "do my bit" to counter all the rubbish that misinformed idiots write about Bitcoin.  Please feel free to add any 'snippets' you can offer on the blog - i want to build up a large collection of 'model' responses , that can be adapted and used when necessary. These will of course change over time as new inaccurate 'flaws' get published by the MSM  
@_date: 2014-09-12 21:01:21
However, they did admit one thing in their conclusion that, in effect, signs their own death warrant 
see twitter pic here 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:33:57
the bitcoin community doesnt give him airtime, But the mainstream FED/Gov. backed media are all over him  .. nice to see him finally exposed as the fraud he really is. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:42:33
great post - the  gives you a big thumbs up !
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:29:40
interestingly - if you type web address Gox.com ( which was registered by karpeles on 24 feb 2014 ) it redirects to MtGox.com ?

@_date: 2014-05-31 15:47:02
lol - I'm neither !  But Mark Williams should have the guts to admit he was wrong, instead of pathetically trying to salvage any credibility from his broken career as an "expert" ! 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:50:10
a very good question !  
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:56:49
Just my thoughts - but based on a long investigation of Williams anti-bitcoin postings, and examination of his own blog at Boston University website, the "co-incidence" is striking/
until early december 2013 Williams had NEVER ONCE mentioned bitcoin ( in over 100 posting on his blog ) In late Septemeber he called in his Boston Blog for jamie Dimon to go ...
he has not mentioned Jamie Dimon since, but he has produced over 50 postings attacking bitcoin - in two months
Before his start of postings about bitcoin he was averaging 5 to 6 posting a month. Since his first bitcoin article he has been average over 25 anti-bitcoin postings a month
People dont change their pattern of behavior that dramatically overnight .. without a major underlying incident. So is there a link ? .. there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that says there is ...  you decide.

The Rat has set up a 'countdown clock' ... only 40 days left til Mark Williams 'bitcoin will trade for $10 or less" runs out !!
[countdown clock](

cheers Bruce - sadly i'm in Europe ! ( Paris Time ) 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:48:30
this is possible I agree - but it is mark Williams  'sudden conversion' to an avid 'anti-bitcoin' commentator that is extremely suspicious. Radical and dramatic changes in behaviour is a signal that something dramatic has occurred in his persona and/or personal life  .. All the signals are there, i've just connected the dots !  
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:02:55
have you seen the  on twitter that the mini   are undertaking ? - creating a decentralised social media project , driven by its users, spreading word on bitcoin and helping good causes and charities like the HeroRATS in Tanzania - sniffing our landmines to save lives.  
So far there are over a dozen around the globe - aim is to reach 100 by mid 2015. 
outline of the idea can be seen here during Paris bitcoin conference interview
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:20:55
certainly didnt mean to give that impression( would never want to collect email addy's )  i've now removed the email form ... as someone else has now posted the pdf   ..and this report is 100% genuine .. the link is at the foot of my blog article

I'd join you !!!

nice try ! .... bitcoin isnt going to crash
was $447 three hours ago .. now at $475 and curve is climbing again
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:19:11
thanks for that info - i was waiting to hear back from PwC as to why they had withdrawn it from their website before I also posted it . 
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:08:58
I think as he is a supposed to be a 'risk expert' , we need to ask him if he foresaw the financial crash of 2008 ? , and if not, why should anyone believe his 'warnings' on the collapse of bitcoin to $10  !  
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:11:29
storage issues are simply one of sensible security .  Can i ask you if you would you walk around a City centre at midnight, with you wallet on view, open, and showing all your money ? No , of course you won't. you'd be insane and would almost certainly be robbed.  
the same is true of your own personal security of your Bitcoin wallet. if you use dubious on-line storage whether in an exchange like Mt Gox or on any other holder with 'out of date' software you need to be extra vigilant .  The major Banks Websites are hacked every month and millions are stolen. Credit Cards are skimmed , etc etc and people do not always get a 'refund' - just google for all the complaints from people who have lost money and the banks have just said 'it was your fault' for not being careful with your card, pin code etc .
The SilkRoad  case should not be confused with mainstream Bitcoin users. If you choose to dabble on the 'dark web' you should be prepared to be a victim of crime, and accept the consequences. 
and finally, why post on a "Bitcoin" forum if all you are going to do is criticise from the point of view that you DONT actually believe in the topic ?   
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:34:14
yes - but have you tried clicking the link to the PwC site .. its been removed ! !
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:09:18
Great Comments Andreas - we all have the responsibility of promoting and supporting Bitcoin ( more properly, the Blockchain protocol ) whenever and however we can. There are opportunities every day to spread the word on the real point , that the world is charging very fast and the blockchain and the applications that are developing to piggy-back on top of it are leading the new world.

The Banque de France has a new report - much more positive .. published 23 July 2014.

président et rapporteur général de la commission des finances du Sénat, dans un rapport d'information publié le 23 juillet 2014 intitulé "La régulation à l'épreuve de l'innovation : les pouvoirs publics face au développement des monnaies virtuelles".

its was timed exactly as Warren Buffet gave a live interview on CNBC 
In response to a question, Buffett said bitcoin "isn't a currency" but he "wouldn't be surprised" if it's not around in 10 or 20 years
ie ... he is saying that it's not collapsing anythime soon, and could be around for 10-20 years at least
then the chinese started buying like crazy
see my twitter post here for screen grab of fiatleak at the time
