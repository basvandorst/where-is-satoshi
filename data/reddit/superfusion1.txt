The fact that wealth is transferring out of western countries to others may be a good thing, IN YOUR OPINION, but its not good for the poor and middle-class of those western countries, whose wealth and net worth is decreasing. So you see, its not a one size fits all, or rather one fact is correct for all the world. Its good for some, but bad for others. Personally, I've seen my wages drop. I used to make more money 10 years ago. That's bad for me. So its great that the world is less poor, but that really doesn't matter to me and my family. I'm not the only one with that opinion. Others share my opinion.

What do you base that on? Citation(s) please. I don't believe you.
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:02:18
*thinks intently.* you are right. I stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:53:50
You are correct. The world has never seen true Communism. Also, the world has never seen true capitalism. America does not have true capitalism. America has crony capitalism, which is different than capitalism.

Hmm. I want to thank you for that viewpoint. You need to be very careful to see through the propaganda. It seems that other organizations don't agree with the worldbank. For example, the report from National Poverty Center  says that extreme poverty INCREASED by 160% from 1996 to 2011.

Also: 
You can debate who is more credible and all that, but the fact remains that there is no confirmed consensus on this matter.

I concede you are correct. But the massive corruption in the system is a bad thing and many of us suffer for it. And I believe that as the corruption and manipulation of the system by the elite rich over the poor may threaten its very existence. (there is a saying, which goes: Every institution tends to fail from an excess of its very own principals. i fear that capitalism may become one such institution)

Well, you are technically correct, but the bigger picture is that state protectionism is due to corporatism and oligarchy. That is, the largest corporations tell the state how to regulate and who to protect (usually themselves). So Crony capitalism (and corporatism) has led to state protectionism (for the wealthy).

By many measures: The quality of life for most people becomes less and less as years pass by. the middle class is getting smaller and smaller. Wages have dropped. People are in debt and mortgaged to the hilt. Capitalism only works for the people on top, not the masses. So capitalism fails for most people. It only succeeds for the rich. For most people, it fails.

Corporatism is a form of capitalism. A bad form, but a form nonetheless.

Is this arbitration binding? and how do you enforce judgments?

@_date: 2018-02-05 05:37:30
so Thailand means "Land of shit"?
@_date: 2011-09-29 03:03:55
yes, this is propaganda too
@_date: 2011-09-29 03:01:25
Yeah, this sounds like FED propaganda.

you have no idea what you're talking about. Bitcoins are not worthless. you can cash them in for real money.
