if you zoom out long enough it looks like just another dip 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:10:06
this thing is shit. just buy S&amp;P 500 on 300% leverage way smoother and higher returns 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:09:50
FUD means it's fake. Police raids and legislation is real. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:33:44
2 hours, 13 minutes, and 30 seconds. source: this guy  lol
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:12:09
more like a pinto. sub 6000 soon
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:00:11
not true. forks and alt-coins adds to supply 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:18:55
that guy must be rich  now
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:20:27
he's got connections who told him this is the bottom lol
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:50:54
and the price is plunging,. it must suck having $1 million in coins and then the next day be down $150,000 . Too much volatility to stomach 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:10:29
there is not  a way to dress that up as anything but bad news 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:19:51
Then how does N E O exist then? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:00:59
if you set it too low it won't get mined 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:19:42
I'm American, therefore I know exactly what Trump will do and what Congress will do. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:18:19
cool story bro 
I think it's explicitly obvious what the word ban means 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:25:34
hackers love AV because those ppl are the easier to steal from because they are duped by a false sense of security. AV is useless against sophisticated hacks 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:17:55
How long will it be before typical users will not need to spend $20+ dollars on transactions? I have $200 of bitcoin on a wallet that I will not use because I don't want to pay huge fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:12:20
bitcoin going to 3000
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:42:34
and its cratering again. sub 6000 soon
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:59:23
the alt coins make it worse by increasing the size of the market and thus less goes back into bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:17:59
there is no way to spin this as anything but bad news. going much lower for now 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:23:25
so I wont be able to read james alltucher report about how to make tons of money with crpyto that james is apparently unable to do himself but it otherwise so generous to give away his 'secrets' for just $700 . darn.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:53:23
the only ppl getting rich are those who bought before 2017 
no way bitcoin goes any higher from here. too big. every time the price tries to go up, it falls $3,000. 
The headline should be "Those who bought before 2017 got rich and you didn;t" 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:06:04
but most people in those countries are too poor to use bitcoin. the fees too high 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:00:40
spoke too soon. this is hot poo 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:21:46
yeah bad answer. I want to know when I will be able to send a small amount of money to an arbitrary address without having to spend $20 and wait 2 hours
It looks like this will not happen , neither the answer nor cheap and fast transactions 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:21:09
maybe your friend can tell us who is gonna win the Superbowl too 
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:45:13
dropping hard. It will be a long time before bitcoin recovers 
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:21:22
The problem is you pay fees whenever you deposit money to your node. It only works if you deposit a lot of money at once, which is risky.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:22:33
wait too long and people will quit due to fees being too high 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:10:08
soon will be 12000
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:51:36
if you wait longer you  can buy them at $5000 again
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:03:55
that will pay for the transaction fee 
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:31:03
going to get worse 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:24:37
So no more James altucher scam ads? good. hope google does the same. someone should set his hair on fire. the grease alone could power enough bitcoin rigs for a century 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:06:54
they call it 'dry shits' 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:19:04
no one knows 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:22:02
he's fucking brain cancer
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:20:04
it seems like these dip buys have endless capital. Here is a better idea: why not just stick it in a bank and retire than pissing it away on dip buying 
why not just wait till $5k. then you can buy 2x as much 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:09:16
how are police raids and possible shut-down of exchanges 'benign' . take off your distortion glasses and see reality 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:14:04
going lower. you been warned. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:12:13
It's so funny when prices drop ppl say they will keep buying more. tell me where I can get a bottomless bank account. If I had access to infinite funds, I would retire, not buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:42:35
this guy must be having the worst week ever . losing $60 million in 2 days. ouch 
I hope he pays his taxes. gonna have a big IRS bill lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:19:56
How long will it be before typical users will not need to spend $20+ dollars on transactions? I have $200 of bitcoin on a wallet that I will not use because I don't wan to pay huge fees. 
Just because two nodes work is not a good answer
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:55
isn't lightning network suppsoed to fix this problem 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:13:36
FML FMLM fuck fuck fuck.. wish I had dumped 10k into it a week ago 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:13:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:44:32
no 
gonna go much lower. Asia always dumps big 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:13:22
and we're back...
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:48:10
yeah . sub $10k soon 
People in Asia waking up 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:11:32
tis the season for heavy selling..one would think price action would be subdued on holidays. nope 
amazing how quickly this thing falls
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:12:31
take the loan anyway. not like the shark can take your brainwallet 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:12:00
so close but sellers yank the rug again 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:42:26
drops like a rock ..what a joke this is 
I would  like to see someone  just do a market order for 100,000 coins and get it to $10 ..once in a lifetime buying opportunity 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:22:17
That just goes to show how past performance is NOT indicative of future results. A 43% correction became a 63% crash. Those who used margin in anticipation of the 43% level holding got hosed. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:00:54
crash time. see ya at 7600 again
