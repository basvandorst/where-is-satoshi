He’s very bad indeed
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:28:13
Why that’s the great Autismo
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:41:31
We all need friends in these trying times 
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:08:12
And nobody wants a distributed girlfriend

Strong assertion, you must know something the rest of us don't 
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:13:54
I found out today that Craig Wright is a piece of shit of infinite proportions. And he doesn't care about anything 
@_date: 2018-05-10 09:29:34
He also hates jalapeños because they hurt his tummy and makes his mouth feel nasty
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:49:53
No, he slides his arm sleazily round your back as you're walking over to the nice shiny well made bitcoin car and walks you over to a Ford Focus with chrome spinners, neon underlighting and go faster stripes, and says 'this is the real bitcoin, don't believe what everyone else is saying, if you don't believe me visit my website'
And then he'd slap it on the roof and say 'this thing can fit so many centralised Chinese mining servers in it'
@_date: 2018-10-03 17:35:49
Then you would be rich! If it dominates 
@_date: 2018-10-03 17:36:38
Wow imagine that 
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:39:14
You're scaring me!
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:54:23
Sorry Mike, carry on
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:57:47
I don't have a cat, but I do have a 10 year old dell laptop that's still runs pretty well 
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:41:05
I wonder what it has in store for trump
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:46:57
Just because someone's account is 2 months old doesn't mean the person has only been on Reddit for 2 months
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:20:07
Good old human nature, just like jacko said 
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:00:35
I'd rather be uncognizant on drugs than Donald trump
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:10:48
Nice try buffet
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:10:29
Yes. But I only like to get hyped about when everyone else does, because I’m a dumb human 
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:09:28
He’s caused harm and damage to people during his life than Craig Wright. And Craig Wright is a cunt
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:44:49
Buy high, sell low, that’s the way you crypto
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:06:08
Found the trump supporter ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:21:08
Cool. What’s your favourite thing about Iran
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:08:34
Who’s your guy? Trump?
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:08:53
It’s a platform as a service (PAAS). So a cloud environment where multiple apps can be deployed and developed. It was a useless piece of shit when it came out, but as time has gone on more useful stuff has been developed by Microsoft and it has become a pretty powerful cloud platform or infrastructure
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:08:49
Just guys, talking to other guys. Nothing sexual
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:20:35
Why is she nasty? Not saying o disagree with you btw 
Trumps pretty nasty himself. And very tacky too
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:26:34
That’s great, if you could abolish one female right, what would it be
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:53:52
If a woman was stood there with a vote in her handbag or whatever, what’s the worst thing you can imagine happening?
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:18:31
Oh I see. Who’s your favourite one
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:07:48
He sure is. With his big ugly orange neck and all
The funny thing about trump supporters, even though they might have slightly differing views on trumps policies and behaviour, not one of them will acknowledge he has a fat, ugly neck. Try it sometime

Thank you Warren Buffett 
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:11:54
I feel fine 
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:06:47
Yes and you will get them! 
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:36:07
*potentially 
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:52:37
I was going to kill myself but then came on Reddit and saw all the memes and felt better. Just another dip in road guys 
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:36:42
Or possibly something completely different 
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:36:48
I think you must be mistaken 
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:16:27
This feels like marketing 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:56:56
Yes absolutely, lets not forget that one..
Interesting to see I'm being downvoted for the previous comment which is simple fact
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:53:02
It's also he same reason bitcoin.com promotes bcash over bitcoin. Roger Ver owns the domain and knows he can trick people just getting into the space to think bcash is actually bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:50:59
All the christians are going crazy for doge at the moment 
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:53:58
Because you just advertised that you hold a not insignificant amount of BTC. So if someone capable and malicious saw this post, they may think it’s worth checking you out.
As a start if you have your Reddit account linked to your email address, it’s probably not worth the risk of putting a post like this out
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:00:27
Be careful, they got CCTV 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:56:14
We here a serious and skeptical bunch here. But we are also highly speculative. So we will try to pick holes in your time traveller story, but we won't immediately discount the time traveller, just in case this was the investment assurance we so badly want, from the future 
@_date: 2019-01-23 12:53:40
Holy shit. I meant to reply back to him as well. It feels like missing that last opportunity to see someone before they die
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:37:08
Just a little bubble 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:32:52
Yeah but what op was trying to demonstrate was the sheer scale and complexity of this network of connected nodes, with the one lonely node of Roger Ver forgotten out on its own.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:12:57
It does use the brand that it ripped off to market its own product. You can't deny the ambiguity and confusion caused for newbies 
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:53:13
And that's probably the reason the decided not to regulate
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:36:03
You need to have already been used to still be able to buy
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:42:01
I heard Putin uses windows 8
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:52:59
Hey 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:33:19
Or one of his rented friends 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:44:55
It was perfectly clear on my iPhone 6. Maybe it's your phone?
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:08:26
Is your trusted source Tommy Lee by any chance? I saw that post earlier too..
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:23:49
Ah cool, thanks for explaining that.. makes sense
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:01:43
You heard wrong! Organic bananas are between 2-3x better for you 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:04:03
No I'm his brother 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:42:30
Someone has shorted bitcoin meaning they have effectively made a bet on it going down. They may be creating a lot of sell volume to bring the price down, to encourage more selling and help them make their short 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:25:25
Finally, a voice of authority telling us what we all want to hear
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:25:03
Excellent analysis 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:07:25
You are all terrible people
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:21:05
Yeah but if the price goes up again I can achieve my personal moon - a solid gold snooter
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:21:57
The kind of person who says 'bitcoins' instead of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:53:19
It's got to happen at some point 
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:53:47
Good bots
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:05:31
Me neither 
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:39:24
He most likely has a hand fetish, don't engage him 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:11:20
Interesting, good stats 
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:12:13
Look at my hat 
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:03:20
No. That the genesis block mined by satoshi is the BTC blockchain
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:25:41
I can tell you it’s really paid off for me recently 
Been a great year 
@_date: 2019-05-18 09:02:54
Dude chill out
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:52:09
Who did you hear that from? Did his name find other R
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:26:33
Oh yeah, that 
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:04:49
Good work dude 
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:19:55
Thanks everyone, seems so obvious now!
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:46:33
Ok. So BCH blockchain was forked at block 400k or whatever, and when it refreshed every time a new block is mined it is including those 400k blocks before the fork?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:09:09
Either my maths is really bad, or yours is
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:07:08
Especially that guy above that said the thing about the friends
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:46:06
Oh and the Genesis block
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:26:37
No way
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:05:59
I note that our bitcoin advocate did not list wealth in the ways bitcoin has changed his life
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:08:09
You’re lucky, I’m from the UK and lost a many more pounds than that 
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:25:04
Yeah sorry I articulated that completely wrong and you’re right. It’s been a while since I’ve been interested in the space and clearly need to brush up on everything again
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:30:24
But hang on. If you could humour me. If BCH forked from BTC, would that not mean that first block mined on the new BCH chain would be BCH genesis block? Because the BCH doesn’t include locks with transactions from before the fork? Or is this a fundamental misunderstanding about forks?
