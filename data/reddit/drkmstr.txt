It's a ponzi, tried to get on a year+ back and couldn't. Then it was open for those who bought a bunch of their currency. Realistically if they want a robust network, they should allow storage providers the ability to sell storage without buying a bunch of coins from them.

Darnit, we're only moving towards centralization.
@_date: 2015-06-01 05:21:05
First, 1MB blocksize Vs 20MB blocksize is stupid, look at blocksize/minute. Currently we're at 100KB/minute
Why not reduce block time? How does that harm Bitcoin?
There will not be more orphan blocks by percentage and power will be more evenly distributed among smaller miners, further decentralizing the network.
200KB Blocksize

2MB effective Block size against current rate, but on a universal scale: 200KB/Minute blocksize.

Anarchism relating to rulers in the marketplace, but what about national defense how can such a free enterprise system exist in the long term if a country decides to attack us. (I would argue the free enterprise system would provide such technology that enemies of such a country could easily be staved off by a small government with an army equipped with such technology. )
Also I updated my reply  above yours. I forgot to mention Milton Friedman and Adam Smith. (Including "The origin and use of money")

It has everything to do with blocksize. The two controlling aspects of maximum system load is blocksize and blocktime, changing one without the other can do more harm than good.

What would happen if Bitcoin was widely accepted overnight? It could bury most small nodes, weakening the system.
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:49:52
It's already been proven that such a change would not affect the outcome of orphan percentage, internet speeds are now fast enough to support a faster block time.
It doesn't lower the size of mining with respect to time, everything is relative to time, if I want to perform a 50% attack it would require a large hashrate against a certain period of time, however it would be subject to the same if not more probability that someone else would drown my attack out.
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:03:20
Apologies, by "Light" i meant what you call "Pruned" 
Basically a node that only keeps relevant TX information, old buried transactions that are already re-tx'ed have no need other than for block exploration and blockchain history. I'll let people with servers do that, I'm hoping to run a very low power node (perhaps wifi + solar cells) and let it run until it breaks.

- Government Student Loans

If bitcoin is exponentially adopted, there will be something to complain about.
If bitcoin is not adopted at the current rate, there will be something to complain about.
Realistically, there should be an elastic blocksize limit, where fees raise to the exponential. (0.0001/tx for regular blocksize [based on average number of transactions] and a higher fee for anything over that, on an exponential scale).
But that's just me. :)
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:38:33

@_date: 2015-06-10 15:57:54
I support an elastic blocksize with a fee structure that is on an exponential scale. 
If you want to pay 1 BTC for your 5000 BTC transaction to make sure it fits in the next block, why not?
Simplified: 1MB block limit + ??MB (Scaling) block limit for fees far above regular fees. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:10:39

College education helps, depending on the industry. I graduated as a Mechanical Engineer, from Purdue. It definitely helped me get job experience (Their internship / co-op connections are incredible).
I don't think everyone should go to college, not if they don't know what they want to do. It's a waste of time and money, but I don't think we should restrict people from wasting money, just not offer government subsidized student loans to make the money wasting easier.
Then again you already said it, haha. 
Are we talking Mechanical Engineering Technology, Electrical Engineering Technology, or Computer Science, or something else?

3 reasons:
1. I don't have a bit of bitcoin just lying around, I heavily invest every penny.
2. I don't know of a pizza place around me that might be cool with this.
3. I won't be able to complete this challenge faster than anyone else.

Mostly Friedman-esque, but I think a free and open market would benefit us greater than such anarchy. 
Have you seen "Free to Choose" by Milton Friedman?
Also, the USA has had a rough past, but we essentially ended battling over land as we purchased more land than any other country. The governmental system here is almost a polar opposite to what other countries have been. Instead of laws that permit, we have laws that restrict. In other words we see laws as reducing freedom where other countries see laws as small bits of it. 
Friedman is a good listen or read since he identifies our success was from free enterprise, not central planning. He showed that we were the first successful country to follow the wisdom from "The wealth of nations" by Adam Smith.
Here's an excerpt you may enjoy:  (See the 10th paragraph.) It highlights inflation and fiat currency. Also the next paragraphs talk about Bitcoin and other items with no utility value, but still great value among exchange.

Here's the catch with China, it's super unstable. 
Why? They're experiencing economic growth like never before. People are starting to care about other countries and wanting to know more. In fact, Hong Kong just petitioned to have their own elected ruler (China's super angry about that). Even the top leaders in China are paying tons of money to spy on each other because they're paranoid. 
If the USA does some good foreign relations with China, we could see a new Democracy, minus their current Dictatorship. 
I've lived in China for 5 months and I can tell you, it's definitely not perfect, but as people get more money, they start demanding more. China sends more students to my school than any other country (except the USA). It's a great opportunity to befriend people and show them what real freedom is all about.

I think the best thing for China would be if we got our debt under control, stopped trying to mirror their policies and blow past their growth economically. It's how we beat the Russians back during the cold war, we simply got rich through economic freedom. Surprisingly, it was the telephone that liberated quite a few people. Everytime they heard of some terrible event in America, they knew to call their American friends and ask what major terrible event happened in Russia.
Overall, I think our main problem is that we don't mean what we say. Quite a few of our allies right now are asking the question "Where is the U.S.A. ?" as we keep giving them the cold shoulder. 
However, nobody wants us to be the world police, but when countries come under attack from turning a blind eye to rising threats or being complacent, they all turn to the USA as the largest country and ask the question. "Where were you?" Additionally, when those wars get out of hand and they start a world war, we have to get involved and we pay dearly. That is why we've been involved in a lot of world conflicts, because many of the military advisers today have lived through WWII and seen just how much we have paid when we tried to ignore the worlds problems. So today we try and find these upcoming dictators and threats before they reach world conquering status and neutralize them. Many hate us because we intervene, but if it was allowed to play out, those very same people would be conquered, or worse. 
The only problem I see now is that if we play the "let them handle it" card, we may see WWIII and instead of having little to no deficit like we had years ago, it might be hard convincing people that war bonds will be repaid. Thus hurting what won us all the previous wars, our economy. [Link](

Look at it this way, it was played into their culture. 
So let's say you're an American and the propaganda referenced a love for bacon, great football and other things (I know it's a bit simple), whereas the truth didn't have as much of those culturally essential details. It is hard to separate.

You have two options not to risk becoming like a scam:
1. Be completely open. List as much information as possible without damaging security. Include financial reports, even if it includes coffee. Show people EXACTLY how you're making money and how much. 
Tipbots need trust, since everyone is throwing their money into your wallets, it's also super-tempting to skim here and there. It is far better to keep accountable with your users by being open.

I definitely have thought of crowd-fund sales, but I need to figure out how to produce a large quantity of these rather quickly. 
Storage health was debated and thankfully most new MicroSD cards (especially the ones we buy) do a lot of self-repair (bad sector detection) and will decrease in size over time. The goal is that by the time the MicroSD card is about dead, an update will be released in which you can just buy another card with it fully preloaded.
The major problem we're running into is blockchain size, it's huge and only getting bigger. Having a hard drive like bitseed is nice, but it's only a stop-gap measure and is a bit power-hungry as well as weak due to the dual core processor. I will give them credit, it sure looks nice.

The Raspberry Pi 2 is not necessarily low-spec, it is actually close to twice as fast as the  Bitseed unit and is even faster when comparing actual performance.
The purpose of arm based nodes is that they allow cost-effective integration at a local level. Owning a full node should not be restricted to those who have either large sums of money or extra computer equipment.

The difference being, BitCoin has a known number of coins left, someone can strike gold tomorrow and double the supply. 
BitCoin can be defined as a pyramid scheme (within some limits), but it's a known resource, unlike other commodities that can vary. 
That's why DogeCoin (apologies for the reference) has done so well recently, it depends almost entirely on the consistency with the market. Since the scale is becoming linear, the number of coins produced is known and inflation is very low. 
The important thing with cryptocurrencies is market acceptance, just like regular Fiat currencies, you need people willing to trade for that currency. That's one of the reasons the USA sends billions overseas for "aid" where in fact it's keeping other countries recognizing our currency as a global standard. (I'm not saying all foreign aid falls under this, but it's one of the benefits)

The main problem I have is that I've tried that in the past and it ends up setting it up to be ripped off by someone who has a few BTC's laying around and can bulk order some parts and then undercut me. 
However, if you really want to understand my cost, all the parts are listed on the website. If you also want to know the software side, there are many how-to's on how to get a Raspberry Pi node up and running. Just understand that they don't all work as each build is slightly different depending on the version of Bitcoin being installed and the current dependency revisions.

I can't host a node, all traffic is disabled via a firewall. No external connections are allowed unless instigated by the node. 
But I do have fiber optic internet, so I've got that going for me. 
Until then, I'll be building raspberry pi images for other people to download. 
It's actually highly cost-effective. $6.57/yr @ $0.15/kwh which is quite a bit less expensive than a pc.

Have you been in litecoin? It was an innovative shift to bitcoin that paved the way for a whole genre of alternate crypto's, but became stagnant for various reasons. The main problem with litecoin is that it lost its relevancy since other apt coins do a better job, now the only reason it is popular is because it is the most mined scrypt currency. Liecoin is currently significantly lower than it was. DogeCoin (yes, DogeCoin) is far more efficient and supported than litecoin, not to mention it is more up-to-date than litecoin. DogeCoin shed much of the litecoin code last year and is now a Bitcoin clone.
Once Bitcoin stops being innovative, a smaller cryptocurrencies will indeed overtake them, except unlike litecoin, Bitcoins competition will likely come from apple.
@_date: 2015-05-13 12:35:42
More browser stuff....looks like I'll be working mostly on that.
Dogecoin was just an easy and fun thing to do, I really didn't do too much in the way of personalization since making the node took a significant amount of time. I do however have a sourced sticker (not that personal I guess) that is from a country on the other side of the world. It's waterproof and what-not as well.  (No it's not made in China).
Block explorer...hmmm. Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2015-05-11 06:39:23
Look at all the cryptocurrencies clawing for Bitcoin's place. 
Look at all the payment processors who are making their own cryptocurrencies. Heck, when apple gets their cryptocurrency online, it could seriously dent bitcoin's price, simply because it's "apple currency". Apple and other players have significantly more power still, even though BTC has a $3bil market cap, some companies can easily come close if they want to.
BTC needs to continually improve, (that's why it's in beta). Otherwise it'd become like Litecoin and lose its fizz.

Bitseed (1.2Ghz Dual Core) in comparison to the raspberry pi (900Mhz Qd Core)
The storage problem is still prevalent, I'd prefer not to have any external storage since even though it's convenient, it is a risk if the node is shuffled around. 
I also looked into wifi, it's nice, but it can lose connection and is a bit of a mess to set up without some proprietary or fully integrated hardware. 
At the moment I'm also working on getting a 1.5Ghz Quad core unit in, but that'll require a redesign of the case.
Best of luck with your kickstarter!

What benefit does a 10 minute block target have? Look at the extremes and then look at the significant factors. 1 hr block targets vs 1 second block targets.
Shorter block time can lead to a bloated block chain if the size per block is allowed to be too large. Longer block time will cut down on orphan blocks, but they will still occur at the same percentage of the network speed is fast enough to propagate the block info to enough nodes to be seen by most of the miners.
Alt-coins are important because they show advantages and disadvantages of different features and configurations.

"Don't invest what you can't afford to lose" 
BitCoin isn't really a ponzi, it's just a new volatile stock (in reality a currency), that is traded 24/7 and is able to be divided and sold in parts easily as well. 
Paycoin, now that's a ponzi, why: Most of the coins are held by GAW, they're basically selling off small parts, building the infrastructure where little value exists. The market cap is misleading since most of the coins cannot be traded, but as soon as the market is large enough with many exchanges, they'll either sell off slowly, or snap a sell order to wipe out all buys on the market. 
By definition, a Ponzi is that old investors are paid by new investors, (oh wait, that's BitCoin!) what people often leave out is that there must be a central party carrying out the exchange paying off old investors, and new investors must be promised a consistent, or at least some growth, neither are true with BitCoin. 
Not that I hate GAW, I actually almost bought a miner or two from them, I just am cautious about spending my hard-earned money on something that looks a lot like a ponzi. 
Additionally, there is a coin called "Ponzicoin" where you actually pay coins online to get more coins, the later groups pay the current groups, etc. I think it's dead now.

ITT: Block time shouldn't be changed
 arguments: 
1. Shortening the blocktime is dangerous, Orphans! Wasted Network Power! Geographical Segregation and concentration!
2. Shortening will reduce confirm time, increase network diversity, and reduce the need for centralized mining efforts.
 
1. If orphans are causing that much of a problem, why not 60 minute blocks? or 1 week blocks? We're already getting orphans at a rate of 1-2 a day, that's still over 0.5%. 
2. Shorter block times are great, but let's remember that coins with 5 second blocktimes had problems with network lactency, which encouraged centralized mining. 
Conclusion: Calm down, Bitcoin needs work, it's still in beta, remember? Otherwise it'll become no longer high-tech or relevant.
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:55:35
Proof of reserves, yes, but what about banking?
If I put my bitcoins somewhere safe, let's say a "Coinbase Bank" and earn interest, I would hope they lend out a significant portion of those bitcoins at a rate of interest so that my account can grow.
Since this bank wouldn't be covered by a federal reserve, bank runs could be possible. However, as history has shown, even in such a case, only a small percentage will be completely lost.

Please do not implement this until other major updates are included, forks should not be taken lightly. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:11:14
I was a giant cryptsy fan, so I went along with a lot of the things that were happening.
When they announced mintsy, it was effectively sold as an exchange where mining power was bought and sold on an open marketplace. 
You could rent out futures of your own miner (so cool) and buy others. It also was supposed to have options so you could bet on different mining farms. 
It was supposed to be a fully open utopia of mining. 
Then nothing.
The contest (sign up and the winner gets 30 LTC! or something) which was set for the launch date (Nov 1st, I think) was delayed by a month...then 2...then it sort of arose. 
It was a total failure, it was based off of GAW's design, I knew that there was something up because it had nothing they said they'd do. 
And up until that point, they had done so well. 
I still think that there were other problems (which is why I pulled my funds out far before that) but mintsy went from being a really cool idea to something they were hoping to GAW to get their funds back, I think.

By that logic, should we go POS only as well?
We need voting for dynamics, miners are the only form of voting that cannot easily be taken over (due to cost). 
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:06:56
As long as there are checks in the process (mining is currently rather transparent, if you mine a block, your IP gets broadcasted). 
Having such things like voting for blocksize apart of mining is acceptable if it is considered another step in the security of Bitcoin transactions. If blocks are full, double-spends can more easily occur, etc.

Apologies, IP's are shown that relay the block ( now does this mean that it was mined at that IP? Maybe, maybe not.
Yes, BIP100 changes that, but if not, how else can it be dynamic and voted on? BIP101 does grow the size, but what if it is growing too fast, does that merit another hard fork? This is what worries me.


Yes, double-spends are bad for merchants, but the double-spend issue mirrors that of a 51% attack, such a similarity would implore mining pools to avoid that. 
I can't predict the future, but hopefully things will happen like they did with GHASH.io when the hashrate became close to 50%, all companies mining there switched away since people refused to purchase from companies that supported a possible attack. (Example: Bitfury)

I can answer that question! :)
You can buy things after the fork on either network. (You essentially have "X" Bitcoins and "X" Bitcoin-XT's) as long as you hold those coins when the fork occurs. 
If you have those coins in an exchange or in an online wallet, you might only get one or the other. If you want BitcoinXT coins, then get your coins into a personal wallet ( and save the wallet.dat file ( or private keys from the address your money is at) and then use that wallet.dat file or private key on the alternate bitcoin wallet (whether it is bitcoin or bitcoin-xt) after the split. 
It's confusing a bit, but we light cspan watchers will survive :P

Let me redefine it a bit.
When the transaction backlog is significant, the fee to be included in the current block is higher.
1MB hardly ever fills up, but when it does, people get blocked from quick confirmations based on luck and timing.
With this system, people could easily see that higher fees are or are not needed based on the current blocksize and/or block distribution. 
The other significant benefit is it will make Bitcoin nearly impossible to spam.
@_date: 2015-08-03 14:38:23
No, I was merely pointing out their fees were a bit confusing, so I decided to simplify them into an excel graph.

@_date: 2015-08-31 17:30:14
Smaller blocks do equal less orphan blocks, however the system can handle more than we are currently taxing it. If the blocks are larger, miners can and will make more from fees, far greater than the block propagation issue. 
The difference is that miners want to earn more, but without losing out due to orphans. Who is better at making that decision? Us or miners?
Miners understand that spam is bad for the system, the transaction backlog requires they go through more data to figure out what transactions to include. 
Ideally, there is a good tradeoff between block size and the negative repercussions. The people who are most effected by the block size are the miners, thus they should vote.

@_date: 2015-08-21 13:57:15
The goal of my proposal is to have a more standard and measurable metric to determine fees. Currently the idea is to increase fees to skip in line and that will sometimes work, but it's a bit of a guessing game. 
My proposal, while incomplete, allows for a limited block size and an extended one at a known, yet expensive alternative. As a person who builds nodes, its important that the block size stay as small as possible, as well as the block chain size. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:59:56
Miner voting works because it can be affected easily by the average bitcoiner. As we can currently purchase coinbase script space, we could also purchase votes and/or support pools that vote our direction. It is a more open process than other ones. 
Node voting is another alternative, but it can be easily impacted since nodes are cheap. This is the only viable alternative.
POS voting is a joke, Fee voting is a joke, etc
The main problem with miner voting is ddos attacks. Now you can affect the outcome of the system with ddos, it is also a similar problem with node voting.

The fees are quite epic, but the blip does provide one small thing, the increase in the discount in relation to the increase in the fees.

I was never arguing that they didn't spend a lot of money on fraud, just that I really couldn't care less about their financial reasons for charging relatively high fees. 
I do like your idea though, It'd make Purse.io a lot better and a great place for loyal customers.

@_date: 2015-08-02 20:56:44
 reasons
1. You need to choose a low enough discount so people will actually take it
2. The difference you save between 49% and 50% is 0.07%, Purse.io Fees jump up by almost 1% near the end. (So for a $100 item, you only save $0.07 more by going from 49% to 50%)
Oh and the 29% blip turns out to have the most significant savings increase. 28%-&gt;29% the fee doesn't change, but the savings increases at 1%, which reverses significantly for 29%-&gt;30% where the savings increase by only .53%. Pardon the technical talk.

I'm so frustrated with today, BIP100 is a good idea, we need voting and unlike most other forms, mining cannot be spoofed. It would take a lot of infrastructure and money to swing a vote whereas other voting methods can be manipulated easily.
Even though I sell Bitcoin nodes and would expect an increase in sales if nodes were given more voting power, it would still allow manipulation and inconsistencies. The purpose for Proof-of-Work is that in order to affect the system you would have to spend a massive amount of money, the alternative voting methods do not incorporate that barrier.

The issue is spam. People can fill up blocks with transactions that have minimal fees yet take up the entire block.
A good example is a 64MB max size block where only 1 mb is being filled. The fees gained is .1BTC, however, a spammer can spend .1BTC on the other 63MB and the miners will still likely include it to gain more costs. The problem is with 64MB blocks, the blockchain would increase in size by 9GB per day! 
The major issue is paying for that storage space. Unlike CNN, that data doesn't leave your system, you have to store it for all time (until a decent pruning update comes out). 
Currently with $0.05/GB for hard drives, that's $.45 per node. With 5000 current nodes, that's $225 network expansion cost per day for the entire node network. Not to mention the price of expanding.
The problem is the size of hard drives don't double every 2 years. We've had a 2TB hard drive as a maximum standard for 3-4 years now. We're finally breaking 3 and 4. 
As a node business, it's really hard to take a low cost system and scale like that. I can only handle 1 drive and that limit for me right now is ~2TB. To scale to two drives, would require a system 5 times the cost.

That could only apply if Bitcoin had no effective inflation.
Bitcoin currently has a core 9.9% inflation this year. 
Even if Bitcoin holds a constant value, that means it's inflating effectively at the same rate as the currency you compare it against. 
Here's some wise words: Invest your money.
Investing gets you ahead of that clock (ahead of inflation), yes there are risky investments, but there are safer ones too. I'd diversify.
However, if you want to keep your investments in Bitcoin, the best is Hashnest.com (hands down). I really wouldn't trust any other. (See: [Puppets Risk Assesment]( - Hashnest scores 0/7, least likely to be a ponzi scheme).
Edit: Holding bitcoin is NOT an investment. It's as much an investment as putting a $100 bill under your pillow.

Then we still have a problem.
After 10 years, the absolute maximum blockchain size would be ~26 Teraflops.
Even with doubling every 2 years, that's 4TB -&gt; 8TB -&gt; 16TB -&gt; 32TB. The problem I have is that as a node operator, I would have to buy a hard drive every 2 years. 
All this is aside from the point that I think we both might agree on, which is that it is important to be able to adjust the blocksize (up or down) so the system can adapt without any more hard forks (But without adding new vulnerabilities). I believe BIP100 is the solution, you believe BIP101 is the solution. 
I'm sure someone will think of a better solution to this :)

Help me understand how I cannot undo transactions by using 51% of the network to start finding blocks on a forked chain. Then when I achieve a few blocks ahead (one way or another) I can make a ton of transactions, then drop my longer chain onto the network (with 0 tx blocks - obviously) reversing all my transactions.
So the profitability would be in comparison to the scams I completed, thus they would be equal to the running of a giant amount of hardware (51% of the network) for a day or so, plus hardware costs. 
Is the current price of BTC kept low because we don't have enough network horsepower to back up the higher values?

If he's using some "trusted" service (depends on the ATM company), they can accept unconfirmed transactions since the software wallet would not be able to perform double-spends. 
Even if it's a "local wallet" if he does not have direct access to the wallet.dat file, it's unlikely that he'll be able to double spend.
Once again, it's up to the ATM company to determine which wallets they trust and which they don't.

Many want BIP101 in core as well.
What game theory aspects do you dislike in BIP100?
Do you think my suggested solution for BIP100 by having 2 separate votes (change or stay the same -&gt; Increase or Decrease) or perhaps a more simpler solution of  - Increase or stay the same -&gt; Decrease or stay the same would be acceptable? Both would keep the required vote to be at 51%.
Lastly, the blocks counted must always be odd for this to work (12001 blocks?) as well as no-vote blocks must count towards "Stay the same".

If miners shouldn't have that choice, should we even trust on miners for security? 
If we cannot trust miners we should fork to be a PROOF-OF-STAKE coin. We already trust miners with so much, and since Bitcoin is not entirely anonymous, if anyone tries to harm the system, everyone will see them and a variety of checks will happen.

Why not make it very apparent? That's what I'm getting at, it's important for the general consensus of people who are working on Bitcoin to make it very clear and open where they are at and that when a solution comes down the line, there is a known timetable to implement it and here is the solution somewhere on that timetable.
I mean a simple gantt chart on the foundation website would be helpful instead of just posting already implemented solutions.

Why cant we have scaling fee cutoffs?
So for the 1st MB, it's .1BTC/MB and for the 2nd MB in that block it is double, or .2BTC/MB and for the 3rd MB in that block, it is .4BTC/MB.
So a 3MB block would have .7BTC in fees. (.1BTC from the transactions in the first MB, .2 from the transactions in the 2nd MB and .4....... So junk transactions would only spam the cheaper fees.)
All we need is 4mb blocks or 8mb blocks and we'd be fine.
Basically you would not have to worry about "what fee will make this transaction work" since unconfirmed transaction fees can be easily categorized.

Bitcoin Debit Cards are only bank cards that hold their value in Bitcoin instead of cash. 
It's super lame. 
Perhaps we should make an alternate distro of Bitcoin that piggy-backs onto the current system that will hold essentially no value, except in the power to confirm transactions. 
Idk, I really just think people in Bitcoin right now don't want to change things, especially when we need a faster block time to combat double-spends. 
Honestly, I'd be all for reducing the block size if we changed the block target to 1 block/minute.

It all comes down to efficiency, why have a 20mpg car when you can buy gas for $.05/gallon? Because saving network load is important. The faster / lighter the network is, the more adaptable it will be to new markets and low-powered devices. The thought that network speed will increase and emerging markets can be ignored is false and dangerous as it alienates new users in areas that desperately need bitcoin.

You get TX fees on whatever transactions you include in that block (whatever transactions you choose to confirm). 
It's typically .001BTC/transaction, some pay higher to get better priority. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:53:03
I would argue against that, the transaction fee is far too high. If BTC was worth the $40,000 each that was claimed, each transaction would cost: $4. So tomorrow I wanted to send someone $4, it would cost me $4 + $4 or $8. 
Even at it's previous height, the transaction fee was $0.10, which for me was huge, simply because I moved around my coins quite often (I bought and sold a lot). So unless the transaction fee is reduced to a more manageable size, a price rise will act against BTC. Remember, mining alone still makes millions, we don't have to worry about running on transaction fees for years.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:45:41
I always cash my BitCoin's as soon as I receive them, unless there's an upward trend, then I wait a few hours and sell. (I made upwards of $4 once).
Bitcoin's too unstable to keep a significant amount in at the moment, but I'll still buy/sell with it any day.
I sold a Raspberry Pi node and by the time paypal would notify me of their purchase, I had already spent those bitcoin's on buying the necessary parts and shipping to the customer. I love it, the best part is I'm not out 15% in fees, I get to KEEP the profit spread...all of it. Without the current profit spread, I couldn't expand and offer a Bitcoin node, which went critical (downloading -&gt; supporting the network) yesterday, I hope to have it up for sale soon. 
Now if I can get purse.io working, start buying in bulk, and get a bunch more customers, I might start mass producing these things. :P
@_date: 2015-04-17 01:44:29
That's why bitcoin needs market capitalization as well as a significant trading volume. 
As long as the trading volume is large enough to swallow the speculators and the capitalization keeps anyone from owning a significant portion easily, then it would most likely become a lot more stable. 
But we did just gain tons of new people, so that market cap is still low enough to be manipulated a bit (haha, pun).

Fees are already low, (because it is in relation to TX size, not amount) In a typical transaction, the fee is much less than 1% it's only when the transaction amount is small that the fee is significant.
Fees are there to cover costs to miners as well as node operators (although node operators don't get any dough) because sorting and storing all that information costs money. Fees as they are right now are just enough, but if they went any lower I'm not sure if the miners would want that.

I did the math:
- Cost to run a PC Node: $240.90/year + cost of PC
- Cost to run a MAD NODE: $3.86/year + cost of MAD NODE
- Cost to run a cloud node: $113.88 (1gb ram AWS server)
The best price for a VPS is around $75/yr when you buy 2 or more years.
Ultimately a VPS might not be the best node since it is in a centralized location, the odds are that the VPS node will already have other VPS nodes in the same building, this doesn't really help the network. Ideally you should run a node from where you are, that's what helps the most!

The problem is that this is a dual core 1ghz processor, the new raspi has a 900 MHz Quad core. 
So basically double the power. Finally, I'm experimenting with a few pagefile settings to reduce the need for the large ram. However, running bitcoind, the swapfile is rarely used if the block chain is up to date. 
The major problem I've run into is that 1.5gb is not enough for processing transactions. I'd prefer to have a feature in future bitcoin core releases that allows for ram limiting, as in ignoring further transactions once a set ram limit has been reached. 
This will apply to the bitseed node as well, a 2Ghz combined core processor attached to a sata hard drive (most likely sata1) will do more harm than good as it falls behind with attempts to slowly fill up the pagefile.

I will admit one thing, paycoin could have done significantly better, they did have a lot of off-the-bat support. (I literally saw "Pay with Paycoin" in tons of places.

How else would they pay for it? 
Money doesn't grow on trees, do the math, a simple 5PH/s mine takes 60,000 KWH / day (Given 0.5 WATTS/GH), so even at a rate of $0.08/kwh (including all other maintenance costs), that's $4800/day....or $1.7 Million/year. Cost-effective operations don't just have $1.7 mil to throw away in power costs. That's just not efficient.

Bitmain has not revealed how soon they'll get to 16nm, but from going to 28NM &gt; Fully custom 28NM in 9 months, I think they'll be a lot less than 10 months behind. 
Remember, Bitfury goes into production in January, Bitmain already has a miner with their previous generation chips. If it took 9 months to get from drawing board to a miner, then January only gives bitfury a small lead...on chips.

Splitting up the vote doesn't make it a 33-33-33 vote, it makes it a 50-50 vote.

You're jumping to conclusions. 
A truly free market would not restrict blocksize AT ALL, the problem is that the maximum blocksize keeps the blockchain from getting bloated, the older nodes from being overrun by blocks too large to process and propagate, and people from trying to game the system. 
How about this for a cartel example: Who protects the network? 
ANSWER: THE MINERS
So basically there's a networks security cartel right now! (by your definition)
Look, we need larger blocksizes, but we also need a voting system that cannot be easily swayed. Mining at the moment is extremely expensive to influence. What alternatives can you give that would give such protections on someone trying to influence the system?
 a couple of alternatives:
- Proof-of-Stake, where minted blocks vote - PROBLEM: EXCHANGES AND LARGE HODL'ers CAN OWN THE SYSTEM!
- Nodes vote - PROBLEM: Nodes can be made, a dime a dozen and then taken down immediately after the vote is taken
- Transactions vote - PROBLEM: Miners can make transactions that don't propagate the network and only are included in blocks they mine!
There is an alternative that sucks, nobody would want it, but it's an alternative.....LOST BITCOIN VOTING.
That means you vote for increasing or decreasing the the blocksize based on how many coins you throw into an irretrievable address. (Like what was done for counterparty)

The only problem is off-gassing from the rigs. It can end up in the strawberries.
@_date: 2015-09-02 23:53:58
The cost of the case is less than $5 and only takes 1 hr to print (I can print 12 at a time). Time and QA are no problem for me, but for larger quantities, yes, injection molding would be ideal.
The problem is that an HDD or SD card costs a significant amount as well as the required peripherals. A Roku 3 only has a dual core processor, the raspberry pi has 4. 
The main goal of my node project is that if Bitcoin goes belly-up tomorrow, what is the node worth? Raspberry PI's hold their value very well and so does all the related hardware. The only fully-lost cost is the software. 
That's what makes this node slightly better than some of the competition, it's not 100% proprietary, you can use it for other things. (Even a media center).
That's my number 1 goal is to keep these things constant so that the value of the node doesn't drop as soon as they open the box.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:13:13
The problem is  that the average miner can't afford this stuff. Plus older hardware is not profitable.

Decent idea, poorly executed.
His problem is that he was only after the cash, not after a long term goal.
He also had very little experience coding. Note how he would use the desktop install. It's more bulky to do it that way and it will cause the node to be slower. 
I'm trying to have the node run autonomously, with a web interface. The goal is to also have a few extra features (in order to compete with all the other node guys).
The long term goal would be to start a node business. Unlike many other people, I'm not trying to start a large group, just a small and efficient one-man operation.

The problem is that this subreddit should be about Bitcoin (The code) not bitcoin (the currency) since alt-coins are all based off of Bitcoin. 
I mean alt-coins add to bitcoin, they don't take away from it. The largest time for alt-coins was when Bitcoin was the largest, so it's a mutual benefit. 
Besides, alt-coins help us understand which upgrades to Bitcoin we want based on their acceptance and/or success in alt-coins.
@_date: 2015-09-02 11:14:13
The article was updated.
Initially, the claim was as stated in the header to the updated section "The maximum block size could double every 2.7 months, leading to growth at rates of 16x + every year"
32MB is the restored historical limit, thus a "hard limit" since 32MB is the P2P limit. (Yes, not an explicit hard limit but a limit in the P2P protocol, which already exists).It just removes the 1MB limit so the 32MB limit can be realized.
Also here's my sources:
@_date: 2015-09-02 02:44:12
Doesn't anyone see the problems with this article?
 are a few:
- It makes a horrible assumption about blocksize growth (ignores the 32MB hard limit)
- It focuses on the voting system instead of the intent (funny how this matters, but somehow the 32MB hard limit can be ignored)
Waste of time. 
I mean we all know there are issues, but then again, "Mathematically predictable"? Blocksize has nothing to do with the growth of hard drive sizes, it has to do with the growth of Bitcoin as a payment processor. 
Moore's law applies to many things, but Bitcoin is not one of them.

Hmmm hmmm hmm....
Okay, we can engineer this thing. 
How about this.
I'll need 3 miners, putting out about 2-3kw of juice, a box fan, a plastic sheet, a bunch of ducting, a large filter (with activated carbon if you want to be fancy), a frame, some cheesecloth, and duct-tape. 
Fruit on cheesecloth, cheesecloth on frame, frame inside duct.
Get another duct, place sheet in duct, place bitcoin miners on duct, cut holes through duct for power and duct tape to make airtight. 
Place fan in front of duct with miners, duct tape to duct, attach second duct with fruit with filter in between both ducts....duct tape together.
That'll do it. 
 the parts and costs:
- [Filter]( $32
- [Duct tape]( $2.70
- Trunk duct... I'm just too tired

When network fees are currently $.023 and they claim network fees are $.23. 
It adds up when you use cryptsy a lot.
10 withdrawals, makes that number climb to $2.30. 
As a guy who does a lot of microtransactions ($.25-$1.25) that can eat up a significant amount of each transaction.

Which contest? The dates kept changing. I got spooked when the launch dates were all squirrely. 
I'm just spooked easily, don't get me wrong, I have ALWAYS suggested cryptsy as a solid trading platform, but as of recently I have stayed away since I just didn't like the mintsy platform. (I was hoping for a very open, tradeable mining currency, just like the MN1 (or whatever they were called), not mining rig rental. 
When a trading platform makes promises, such as release dates and does not deliver, I find it hard to trust such a company with money. 
As far as your question, no, but I used that contest as a metric to determine whether or not to dive into mintsy, when the release date and the contest didn't follow the set dates, it gave me reason to withdraw my funds. After a test-trade a few weeks back, I still stand by my decision.

I unfortunately cannot have any as my networks firewall blocks all incoming "externally initiated" connections. Hence why I made these, what if you could changetip someone a node? :O

They simply would stop buying / selling with Bitcoin, we are free to refuse accepting checks, credit cards, etc. The only money that has to be accepted is the US Dollar. 
Additionally, such a totalitarian regime would have to be voted on, unless it was by executive order, and in that case, we would already be near a civil war.

This is old news, I already made a Raspberry Pi node, it's stable (unlike the old pi) and is a quad core processor. Total power requirement: 3-5 Watts. 
Unfortunately I only have 1 Raspberry Pi 2, so until I can afford another, it's only a Dogecoin node.

It's straight forward, I just like hashnest and have been using them for over a year. [I even reviewed it publicly](
When I first started people only suggested BCS, which looked like an obvious scam to me, I had to find hashnest on my own, I just want to cut out the frustration. 
Why am I so concerned? People have been shadowbanned from for less. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 00:57:31
It all depends.
If you can't open up the port, then you're stuck to a limited series of local benefits.
1. Your transactions from computers and wallets behind that firewall will be able to propagate to the network in more places more quickly. 
2. Your node will be able to bridge and propagate data to other nodes that it finds (not wallets, just nodes), most firewalls restrict only incoming traffic, so your node should be able to form connections to nodes it finds.
3. Your node increases network rigidity since public nodes can be more easily attacked.

If you read his reddit post, it was because nobody was paying into the tipping pot. The XAPO integration guarantees a full tipping pot. 
I'd only complain if the pot was already full when they switched over.

 are three parts to US Currency related to this.
1. E Pluribus Unum ("From Many, One")
2. In God We Trust
3. Liberty
E Pluribus Unum literally means: "From Many, One"
What does this mean? When you become an American, you become one of us, not primarily identified by your ethnicity, or past, you are an American. 
In God We Trust means that we're founded on the ideal that "God" is the source of all values, "endowed by their (our) Creator with certain unalienable Rights"
Why "God"? Because regardless of what you believe, we place the giver of these rights as one higher than any government, king, or reason. Since they are given by this higher authority, they can never be taken away. 
The last is Liberty, which is just as defined; "the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views."
BitCoin doesn't have any of that. But that's not super important. US currency represents the USA, BitCoin represents the simplicity of itself. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:05:19
Yeah, unfortunately GAW sold people on "Sure things" which is both the fault of the gullible and GAW. People should never invest that which they cannot lose in cryptocurrency or any risky investment for that matter.

The point was that the rights were given by a higher authority. 
Believing there is no giver of rights is a tangent that can be debated. 
By no one having ability to give rights, nobody has rights. And if rights are not rights if they have to be given, then that's a false statement. If rights are given, they are not rights. Well, I guess we all have rights until they are given, then our rights are taken away, right? Quite simply the logic is flawed. Rights do have to be given simply because without rights set in place, we have no protection against attempts to take away those rights since said rights are already given. Remember, the constitution was formed because of the blatant elimination of rights. The goal was to design a system where an individual's rights cannot be infringed regardless of party control. Additionally, that is the same reason for the checks and balances within the government to keep a single branch from overreaching. 
In summary, the point was the rights given in the statement were given by a higher and irrefutable authority and thus could not be taken away or refuted by any lesser authority.

Most Definitely not "A series of tubes"
I'd call it a highway of information where your destination is based solely off of your interest and your speed is set by your bandwidth.  
The point is also to connect with a large portion of the financial population, retirees, baby-boomers, etc. Most of them understand the benefits of cash and can more easily adopt a system based on that. 
Calling it a "Distributed non-copyable database" is the same as calling it electronic cash. If asked, it's counterfeit-proof. 
Oh and it can be copied, it is the changing of things within that database that cannot be done. (As in I can theoretically copy the BTC network and fork it, I would gain control of my BTC I spent, but nobody would recognize it.)

Every time I use Github it crashes on me. 
The largest problem is that I intend to send it out with a full working blockchain, that is not capable on github since it needs to be updated regularly and the size of the blockchain is massive. 
I will not include a bootstrap since it still requires about a week to index the blocks. The whole point of the project is minimal startup time.

I've seen this previously. 
1. You might be trying to withdraw too quickly, it might take a few days to withdraw 180+ BTC
2. Cryptsy is checking to make sure you didn't steal that BTC from them. (Some users made fake trades using cryptsy's api to exploit a bug a long time ago, then they withdrew it. Cryptsy caught them and gave their account a negative balance, effectively locking them out of their account until they paid back what they stole.  
Be patient, keep proof of your transactions. If you actually stole the coins, then I have no pity for you. If not, please be patient, you're going to be fed lies by tons of cryptsy trolls by freaking out. 
Just understand that cryptsy has yet to steal from their customers in any proven case. They are and have been the first legal bitcoin exchange on US soil, throwing that away is far too risky for them.
