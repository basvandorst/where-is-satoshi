What is stopping them from offering both payment models? It would bring in the customers who don't think they will get their value out of the subscription. PPV doesn't have to replace subscription it just gives options.

Don't forget the planes. How are the terrorists going to fly a plane into a building if we ban all the planes?

I think the point is to have an exit. I can keep my bitcoins in the bank if i choose but if I lose confidence in the banks I can also be my own.

One thing that could contribute to keeping prices lower is that the ATM in Vancouver uses Bitstamp to get its coins. So a lot of Canadian volume is on non-Canadian exchanges.

Many bitcoins have been stolen and this will only become more frequent as more people with bad internet security habits enter the market and as the value of bitcoin increases. Just the insurance on your savings would be incentive enough for many people to give their money to a trustworthy bank.

If you can do fractional reserve with gold why not bitcoin?
