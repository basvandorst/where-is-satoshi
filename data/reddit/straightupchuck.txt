Ok cool, so to be safe I better not try anything on this laptop. Thank you for all of your help with this!

Alright, I guess that rules it out for me, thanks for the info :D

I have considered doing something like this, does mining alternative coins require less from my laptop?
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:11:56
When you say scrypt coins, do you mean the alternative coins like worldcoin, namecoin, or dogecoin? I want to see if mining dogecoins will be better for me than bitcoin, is this recommended?

Cool. I want to start scrypt mining, which seems to be the easier choice, and on a recent video I was informed that if I didn't have a "discreet" GPU, I could not mine. I'm not entirely sure if my GPU is discreet or not, or if I am even correct on what my GPU is.
They way i'm checking my GPU (I think) is by typing "dxdiag" in the start menu, and going forth based on whats next to "processor", is that accurate?
If you could, can you elaborate on the main difference bewteen scrypt mining and SHA-256 mining, and which is most likely the better choice?
Sorry about all these questions, i'm eager to learn!

Is  only used for bitcoin? Or can it be used with alternatives?

When you say nothing, I realize i'm not going to make loads of BTC as soon as I start, but a small profit is a big enough profit for me. Are you saying that the profit will be minuscule, or nothing at all?

I have seen people that are in a situation similar to mine, and put some sort of AC source like a small fan or something near there source, will this at all help or does my laptop not hold any of the necessary credentials to make anything at all. Based on what I have, how long do you suggest it would take to make 1 BTC?

My graphics card (labeled processor) is a AMD A10-4600M with Radeon(tm) graphics, but it is actually in my laptop, is that an onboard or in-cpu GPU? And being a 4600M, is that too low, being lower than stated 7790? And is what I have is this enough to being to mine dogecoin?

Is dogecoin not the same process and everything as bitcoin? From the information i have revived in this thread, any digital currency is unlikely for me at this point, if dogecoin is different than bitcoin, please elaborate :)

When you say "heat" are you referring to the work that is going on internally, or actual heat that is coming from underneath the laptop? If is actually the heat, would applying constants AC (a couple small fans) not be enough to sustain?

I haven't even began to mine anything yet because i'm still figuring out if I am a capable of doing so, is there another way to check without actually mining?
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:18:28
WOW. Thanks for putting in your time to find that information :)
So given all of this, is mining basically out of the question as long as this is all the hardware that I have? And you seem to have some knowledge on the subject (A lot), stated that mining alternative coins could be a more beneficial process in my situation, if so, how would I go about doing this?
