Hi,  since it seems like you're from Bitcountant (judging from your past posts), mind if I ask you a question? 
  
Which unique problems have your customers encountered,  that you, as a Bitcoin-specific service, have been able to provide a solution to?  
  
Ofcourse,  I'm not asking for the solutions or how you work,  but I'm thinking that, from an accounting POV, BTC might pose some problems, but nothing most "normal"  accountants couldn't solve (not being a dick,  just curious about the specific value you could add as opposed to a regular accounting firm).

You can find out about the *well-known* practice of leveraging and everything else mentioned with one google search.  
  
VERY quick and basic explanation: when you leverage, you trade with money that you don't own - you buy stock @ $100, only pay $10.  Broker fronts $90.  If stock drops to $90, broker closes your trade for you and you lose everything.

Most of the time I only use the CC for internet purchases.  
  
And something me and my girlfriend have encountered: we track our budget in excel using our bank statements.  The creditcard charge is just one lump sum paid to Visa/Mastercard(we have to split it up using the CC statement), while the debit card movements can be identified immediately on the bank statements.  I know it sounds ridiculous,  but we need to use 2 sources of information and it adds work to the budgetting.

You're combining a few things which makes it seem more complicated that it is.  Mined coins would seem the most complicated,  and while they can be a few different things from an accounting POV, it's basically an asset.  
  
If your business model is mining and you buy/invest in processing power,  mined coins are "Cashflow from Operations" and treated as revenue. 
If you mine with the company PC's during downtime,  it's harder to define, but not impossible.  It wouldn't be CF from Operations,  and and CF from Financing isn't completely accurate as it isn't money that directly created the BTC (interest on a bank account is CF from Financing).  And I don't think it's CF from Investing, as the asset isn't sold (proceeds from the sale of fixed assetsgo here).   In this case it would be income,  just not regular income.   will have to chime in...   
  
And investing in other businesses is simple; current asset(BTC) leaves company and long terms asset(shares in Bitcoin business) enters company.  Dividends = CF from Financing.  Proceeds from unregulated exchanges = proceeds. Maybe you'll be required to add some extra documentation,  and you might be targeted for an audit depending on the amount (because it reeks of money laundering),  but as long as it's legal it might as well be profit from selling your stake in a pigfarm in Timbuktu (ie. something that sounds fishy,  but is not). 
  
The only thing I'm not sure about are the mined coins if mining is a side-business and that's just cause I'm not a US accountant.  Bitcoin and the way they're created, are new,  but for accounting/accountants it ain't rocket surgery.

She is 100% right, at the most basic level it's a cash equivalent...  It should basically be treated as a checking/savings account in a foreign currency. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:53:09
There's no such thing as a JPY accountant, EUR accountant or ZAR accountant.  As far as accounting goes,  she should just focus on her studies.   
  
I'm an accountant,  but not familiar with US compliance rules, but even then,  all filings will have to be done in USD, so her knowledge of accounting will be important,  not of Bitcoin.   
  
If Bitcoin was regulated,  there would be accounting framework as well, but it isn't, so for the law/investors/...  your holdings in Bitcoin are a cash equivalent (in reality it's slightly less liquid than cash, so accountants may consider it a savings account equivalent).

Like...?   I prefer my debit card and always pay the balance of my creditcard immediately,  but which other solutions are you referring to? 
@_date: 2012-04-03 09:55:39


Yeah, buy on the rumour, sell on the news...  But this isn't a new article, I read it on another site a few days ago.
People assume once something becomes actual news, it's known by everyone else, therefore everyone else is already invested in the product and has pushed the price up.  After the news it might move up a bit, but I think traders/investors called that "the stupid money moving in".

This might make me sound like an idiot, but I recently "got" index fund investing (as in I understood it). I looked at it in the same way as investing in individual stocks; put your money in one or a few and accept that it can go up or down. But an index will never drop to zero. It's a combination of the biggest stocks of it's market and replaces the ones that fell off.  
  
I prefer options so timing is crucial, but with index funds the short-term profits will be lower but over a lifetime they WILL be there.

Trillions are moved every day through the financial markets.  
  
Hoarding doesn't make money and the financially literate understand this.  It sounds old to say "You gotta spend money to make money" but it's absolutely true. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:34:18
My guess is that the people that understand money are saying this.  The more Bitcoin is spent, the more people hear about it and the faster it'll be accepted.

Then why comment?  Typing MACD into google would teach you something instead posting that comment.

Damn, I fucked up!
On Bitstamp it went to $89 and is back around $114 now...  Buying opportunity (short term at least) was just around the time I said it wasn't...  :)

They're actually below Ferrari in price and luxury.  Their main competitors are the BMW 6 &amp; 7 and the Mercedes CLS &amp; S Class.  
  
They do have Ferrari engines and belong to the same parent company though (Fiat).

You're the guy that [compared the price of Bershire Hathaway stocks to the BTC price]( as if they're related and make [other posts in which you beg for a donation]( if readers like your "analysis",  which you cannot defend or explain.  And ofcourse,  you post this stuff multiple times on any subreddit you think of.   Your Bitcoin-related comment history reads like a pump-and-dump scheme AND HE'S TRANSPARENT?  
  
Who the fuck is paying YOU to post your BTC [tripe]( to reddit? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:18:55


Yeah, I have bitcoins leftover from awhile ago, and my boss pays me.  
  


No, I haven't made an analysis, but I'll call out a shitty one if I see one (You chose to post it, so it's open to criticism).  
  


What explanation?!  You make illogical and irrelevant conclusions and don't explain anything, you just post what you think.  Show me the fundamentals of the 600.000$/BTC analysis.  And defend it when I question it.  
  


  
I'm starting to understand you.  And the fact that you don't understand simple maths...  2 x 0 = 0   (Yes, it's a figure of speech, but still...)
  


  
So, with this you're going to stop?  You're not going to dignify that with an answer?  Or you can't defend what you're saying and pretending to be enlightened so you can ignore my VALID questions.  
  
is saying it like it is.  I'm not going to insult you (or at least keep it to a minimum) cause I really want to see your reasoning, but it looks like you have nothing.  
  
You definitely know the buzzwords and have read economic articles and can use google and wikipedia, but your boner for Bitcoin is making you sound like a broken talking clock, which is (inevitably) is right twice a day.

Consider this post to be the inevitable noise that comes with it.

Exante is not a hedge fund.  They only call themselves that.  They don't use leverage and customers can buy or sell shares of the fund at will.
**THIS IS CALLED A FUND**.  
  
AND ...
They primarily invest in Bitcoins, (which I understand as "ONLY invest in Bitcoin").  Yeah, duh, they're going to have a great performance compared to other [hedge]funds.  BUT, what doesn't get is, those other funds have intrinsic value.  If any of the fund's holdings go bankrupt, they can sell their buildings, cars, material to recoup some of their losses.  If Bitcoin drops to zero, it's ZERO and thanks for the memories.

You got any reply to my first post?  I'm one of the few trying to have a serious conversation, but it looks like you're just spamming reddit and agreeing with people that already agree with you.  Oh, and you say "Research it" instead of proving your point.

As long as there are people saying "I'll sell you ... dollars for ... bitcoin", the illusion will continue.  I don't see it becoming completely worthless, but I'm surprised by the recent climb.  
  
I bought my BTC for €6/BTC and have 0.27 left (which cost me €1.62).  I'm keeping that and hoping for the best while not caring about a loss.

I really don't know what you'd call his condition.  He's all over the place (mentally, not just the subs he posts to), and has posts  resembling a conspiracy nut / bitcoin shill / morally superior abstaining debater / ...  
  
If you disagree with him or challenge his "analysis", even politely, he'll ignore you and "take the high road".  Or call you a shill.  
  
People like him see themselves as early adopters, and promoters, but they come off as the fringe lunatics that make bitcoin look like the beanie baby rage.  And scare people off.  
  
I'm clearly not the first one to say it, but if this is what he's like in real life, he needs help.
  
Anyway, we shouldn't expect anything sensible from you, so I'll say it before you do: I'm off to collect my check from the Wall Street PR firm for a job well done.

They trade at that amount because Buffett won't split them.  He is right in thinking that an "accessible" price makes the stock more vulnerable to the negative effects of short term trading (because you can't buy 1/100th of their stock).
  
You can however buy 1/100th of a bitcoin, so I don't see how these two are related?

And it's getting bigger by the minute.  It was $126 around 11 AM, $100 10 minutes ago, and it's $92 now.

I don't use summonbot, don't know how it "got" me.  
  
Could you link to the research about BTC's intrinsic value?  Thanks.    
  
The reason hedge funds use leverage is to maximize their positions.  They don't use leverage in the classic way, by taking on loans.  An example would be taking on a short position that has to be paid back later.


True, but the shopping center is a bad example.  A better example would be a fund that goes short 10mil in oil stocks and long 10 mil in clean energy.  Their total net position is zero.  A major advancement in clean energy might cause their long position to increase 5 mil together with the value of their short position dropping 5 mil.  Which earned them 10 mil.
  
And, I'm curious for your reply to [my other reply on this post.](
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:54:49
I can't agree with your analysis, or at least what it's based on.  
  
* I'm not familiar with the hedge fund you're referring to, but was BTC the reason behind their performance?  How did their BTC holding compare to their other investments?
* Buying a financial instrument because a competing hedge fund has it is no way to run a hedge fund.  Decisions like that are based on in depth analysis of the instrument and it's fundamentals (just because hedge fund A owns Apple doesn't mean hedge fund B will also buy Apple).
* Saying it did "10 x in 4 months but it did 4x in one month" is like me saying "Google's share did 10x in it's first 8 years, so it can do 10x in the next 8 years".  Completely possible, but you're using the past to predict the future (I understand you're saying the 10x will come from hedge funds, but that is uncertain).  
* I admit, I don't follow BTC too much, but how do you calculate the intrinsic value of BTC?  How do you, or anyone else, say "BTC is undervalued"?
* And while we're on value, why is it "**still undervalued becuase the total currencies of the world will also be investing a portion of their holdings in bitcoin becuase bifcoin is both a wealth protector like gold AND a currency**"???  
I really don't see much logic behind your post, mostly just jargon with no background...
  
BTW, please post the name of the hedge fund as I'd like to read up on it, thanks.  
  
And, asking for money is against the community rules and kinda disgusting as well.  If you're qualified to make this kind of analysis, you should get a job doing it or find someone who'll pay you to do it, otherwise just discuss it without the begging.

I'm glad other people see this guy for what he is.   Bitcoin is interesting,  but his combination of idiocy,  arrogance,  and imagined expertise is frustrating,  and makes newcomers thinks Bitcoin is a conspiracy ridden object.
