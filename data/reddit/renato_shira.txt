I just calculated some data for you all:  
From all btc available (utxo), only 41% was moved this year(2018).
23% was last moved in 2017. (these people are holding)
The rest was not moved since previous years (\~5% per year).
PS.: you need to know what this doesn't consider exchanges and btc can be moved from people off chain

I respect your opinion. But I argue that this has nothing to do with being bullish or history of ongoing growth. Because the growth is not a requirement, since it is a ratio in an approximation of  "price now"/"price acquired". It just happens that in a bullish markets, the MVRV will be majority of time above 1, and bearish markets, below 1. But, in all cases, where the market is heading to a stability (a "fair value"), the MVRV will converge to 1

this is exactly why we almost always see a big last drop in the bottom, because people get emotional, panic and sell. But now there is less and less people that will eat a loss (the majority of people think: "I'm already losing, I won't sell this anymore", Econ Nobel prize 2005).   
Take a look at the MVRV indicator. It have to converge to 1 over time. Draw the support and resistance lines, and they will converge to 1!  It already touched the support line when  \~3.1k.  [  
So it's unlikely that it will go further
