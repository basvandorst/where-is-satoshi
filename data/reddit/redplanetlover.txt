Just imagine a future Earth when the posession of one BTC is what you need to be one of the Elite and all the rest struggle for the thousandth and millionths of one. A great novel of how people pool resources to get one family member into the inner circle just like Russian families in the 19th century pooled resources to get a family member to America.

I am fairly new to BTC but I have 2 thoughts that seem right to me. What do you people think? My impressions are that BTC could go to 200,000 dollars and also that it seems to me that people are using BTC the way they used to use gold, that is to store wealth. Comments?
Well it seems to me that the answer is that people ARE storing wealth in BTC (I am putting mine in a hardware wallet) But the upside to price has not been addressed. If it went from $27 to $13,000 then why not $13,000 to $100,000?

I remember this book. It was a very good read. I know it is one of those books you return to every decade or so.

Correct me if I'm wrong but here is the way I see it. I am very new to this but watching for a few weeks I see that this Bitcoin thing works like this; people buy and trade crypto and take little profits but don't cash out. Instead the idea is to put your profits into Bitcoin like a safe holding spot (hodling if you will) just like people buy stocks and mutuals but then every once in a while they get nervous and put their holdings in Gold. Well, I think Bitcoin is the Gold of crypto.
Am I right? IThis came to me as kind of an epiphany.

I first heard about it when It was at $27 and thought there is no way it could work. I am an Idiot!

not to mention that I have never been able to get my money out of coinbase. They say they can't verify me, no matter what hoops I jump through. It's a good thing I only put $50 in .

I gave you an upvote because you make sense. As much as people want Bitcoin to prevail I think it cannot work because there is just not enough of it. USD is much simpler to use.
