No difference than gambling. I trade stocks. That’s gambling.

That’s a dip???? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:13:27
who's to say what the most accurate price is? Volume of an exchange is one answer to your question. Balance that with easy of deposit/withdraw/ security / fdic etc etc
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:26:24
People here hate FUD- unless it's Coinbase/BCH FUD
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:26:47
Different exchanges have different market participants buying and selling. It is not centralized

Mainstream coinbase support for it won't attract new retail?
Seems like it would be good to own and diversify holdings.

Are you sure it's over??
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:09:24
you will possess a digital amount of the coin. You won't receive or have to download anything. Basically your "record" so to speak will show you have 1 bitcoin.  
Just like how your online bank says you have X US Dollars etc etc

Let me check my crystal ball

So you feel like we are out of the woods? I would think we need to convincingly break the downtrend line before we pat ourselves on the back.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:58:05
I thought the fees / speed was much better with BCH? What makes BCH so bad?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:33:13
Let’s say you run a coffee shop. Imagine every day/week having to adjust your price for a cup of coffee based on the wild swings of value in bitcoin. 
Adds risk and uncertainty to your profit that most companies don’t want.

I see several posts commenting on this... if people getting spooked now wait till it really has downside volatility. After the move it’s had this is normal- actually a larger pullback would be healthy.
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:32:48
Human nature of fear and greed in speculation applies to every trade.

Those are the group that usually sell in the capitulation phase.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:20:32
Seems to be exactly what I would have thought. Is this surprising to others?
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:32:20
Is having it in GDax the same thing?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:27:09
Is it more crazy to believe all these forum members on here will be the next multimillionaires - or that the trade will shake people out of it first.... free sex and money!! sound too good to be true? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:59:52
This type of story seems so frequent in the world of crypto- and will have impact on trust/perceptions of general public.

@_date: 2017-11-27 12:19:42
Look don’t beat me up black belt bob- I just think this chart applies even more so to bitcoin because this chart is of human emotion &amp; greed/euphoria/fear
Look at the board echo it - every drop “omg what’s happening guys” every rise “should I buy?? Will it go up tomorrow”
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:48:22
No need for name calling. Thank you for sharing your wisdom with me. 
One question.
Hypothetically speaking, big crash comes.... Of course we all know this can’t ever happen right, but let’s pretend price crashed hard—
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:29:13
I trade bitcoin to make profit. Up or down, it makes no difference. I don’t trade from some position that this technology is God’s Gift to society. I trade to make money.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:18:10
Very clear it’s not a stock- firmly believe this applies evern more to bitcoin— its rooted in greed/fear &amp; pleasure/pain of the value of ones investment changing in regards to entry.
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:31:30
Imagine if the guy who won the hot dog eating contest didn’t shit for a few years. 
That’s bitcoin without a pullback. Till then -play musical chairs and hope to get a fill when the music stops...
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:33:46
There is a lot of variation between local economies- having only one currency would ignore this fact.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:40:43
In perspective, is this ‘really’ a dip?

The Titanic is unsinkable eh?

I could potentially see it banned someday- but more likely a big increase in regulations.
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:37:38
I agree and I think it will be disrupted in the future by a better product. For now they hype and fear of missing out are making people money and generating headlines so that is good for exposure in the big picture of crypto
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:24:11
“It always comes back up”
NO RISK! Free money! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:43:56
Please enlighten me. Is it narrow minded to be cautious with an investment in an unprecedented, meteoric rise in value? Narrow minded to think, maybe there is more risk in it than people here realize? Narrow minded to not blindly hodl? 
Or I guess that’s just FUD right? 
Doubt shouldn’t be in any investors mind right?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:59:27
So Investors don’t manage risk and expectations?
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:38:39
Imagine if the guy who won the hot dog eating contest didn’t shit for a few years. Same thing. :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:41:49
I think it’s annoying when girls post this on Facebook. I think it’s more annoying when “investors” justify losing money with this quote.
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:39:52
When John Q. Public is talking about buying you don’t think that’s a sign that a trade is getting crowded?
I saw same thing happen with gold. Is btc different? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:14:20
I agree - been trying to figure out safe / best way to buy the futures here in US
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:25:07
That was not a correction. You will be able to tell it’s a correction when a large % of this forum is gone- and posts read as “deleted” in the masses....
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:08:46
Yes. It’s uncertainty, and that very well could lead to volatility
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:05:22
I think larger holders positioning before pulling the rug/ other manipulations are extremely possible. (Not a popular view here I’m sure)

If real panic hit btc I doubt very much that altcoins will be a safe haven.

I’d venture to say most daytraders don’t buy ATH and expect to live long.

I agree with you - my post is more out of principle

Bitcoin is the ocean now?!
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:19:07
People don’t know if it’s a good time to buy. Risk management, your tolerance for pain, your objectives and your timeframe will give you the answer. Nobody knows what the price will be in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:37:52
One of the worst posts I’ve seen on here.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:44:24
Most of the silly posts I read on here make me think the following— will this jackass be the next millionaire from bitcoin, or will the market eat their lunch. 
The frequency of these posts make me feel like it MUST be toppy- but wouldn’t be surprised to see it carry on longer.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:52:32
I think it’s worse to see the people replying to the noobs with things like
Don’t worry, it will come back up
Buy more
Keep adding and be on the safe side
Don’t spread fud 
You can’t lose
It will definitely come back higher
This is temporary 
People say it with such conviction, but in truth nobody knows and the high may be in.
That’s not spreading “fud” that’s the mindset an investor should have. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:46:09
Possible. If that’s true we haven’t seen anything yet in terms of declines and fear in the market.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:35:07
Just half...
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:33:49
Many people on here have informed me bitcoin can’t fail- so it must be due to keep going up...... go into debt for 100k then buy in— you wouldn’t want to be labeled a “fud-er” would you.... 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:37:52
They show different values because there are different exchanges
Look at cryptowat.ch to see the difference between the exchanges- this can also provide some texture as to how bitcoin perceived value is compared to different currencies/ parts of the world (but wouldn’t trade on that alone- just to add to your perspective)
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:18:56
That’s cool that you know what future events will happen! Who wins next years World Series? Also what price is AMD at next year?
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:58:20
Applies to anything humans speculate on.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:03:34
Believing something with such a meteoric rise may be a bubble with a larger drop pending is ignorant? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:54:27
Fascinating. Sounds like we have many differences. Enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:03:09
is there a place you can buy them in the US?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:22:25
Gosh- I guess there’s no chance price will decline in a meaningful way ever then! Forget investing what I can afford to lose- let me take out loans and buy!
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:04:22
Was true for gold. Why not digital currency?

You can’t find an answer anywhere? Googling bitcoin fork brings up quite a lot of articles explaining.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:32:27
Don’t let greed and hope for what you could make- blind you from risk and what you can lose.
That being said I don’t think you should fear the market, but you should respect it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:12:11
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:10:02
Is it ignorant to think the government/ fees/ massive energy waste / lack of ability to use it easily as a currency / regulation could effect bitcoin price in a negative way?
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:06:49
Surprise reinstated fork coming?
