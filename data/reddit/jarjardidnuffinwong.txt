Not really. It's more like, there's paint that has a public recipe, and you legally can't use the paint in any vehicle where the entire blueprints aren't publicly available; if you don't publish the blueprint, you can be sued by the paint company for violating the contract. The paint owners also have to be credited, and if you mixed anything with the paint, you have to tell that to the customers.

Krita is awesome, probably my favorite art software on Linux.

- Friedrich Hayek, 1932.


How do you answer the common economic criticisms of deflation? Do you not see drawbacks to the hoarding that it encourages?

Kinda. The issue is that in such a system, payments made in Bitcoin are not protected in the same way that cash or bank tranfers - so you legally did not pay for your meal if you used Bitcoin (can't get a valid receipt), and the store can't pay its workers in Bitcoin either.

Trump Foundation was even better, their owner even got himself a dinner with Salma Hayek from the donations.

This presents a tragedy of the commons / extended prisoner's dilemma - type scenario. Even if charity is good for the society overall, nothing guarantees that you (as the person donating) get to rent the apartment. The benefit might go to anybody, or diffusely to everybody. You as the player have little incentive to donate.
It's like planting more apple trees to the garden where everybody (including you) gets their fruits from. When you divide the gain by the number of people benefitting, you'll find that your likely gain might not be worth the effort. Even though everybody would benefit if everybody used some of their time to plant more fruit trees. Personal gains != global gains.
