Which is exactly why the manager leaving at the end of the night doesn't have the takings on them.
Seriously, you are waxing lyrical about how to fix complex economic problems but don't even realise that cash rich businesses do not stupidly bring all the cash out by the same employee at the same time?
Have you ever even had a job?
@_date: 2012-07-24 08:51:35
Yeah but on their website they claim "5 star crash test equivalency"
and have pictures of the car with a crash test dummy in it.

Okay, well thanks for getting back to me anyway.

Natwest and Ulster bank which are both owned by RBS, and use their backend systems to process payments and ATM withdrawals.
Then you quote a blog where a majority of people cry about "fiat currency", use that same currency to buy an imagination land currency that fluctuates in value against the dollar from less than $1 for 1 bitcoin to nearly $30 to 1 bitcoin in under a week then back down again, and then they all circlejerk that no one accepts their currency despite the lack of infrastructure and highly volatile nature of their new currency.

Triage my fucking arse, show me, anywhere in that link where it says the FBI only investigate crimes where the dollar amount is more than $10 million.
You are talking shit.

private company decides not to take money from someone.
People can cry all they want, but do you really want legislation forcing people who own their own business to accept all commerce?
A private company can not refuse to do business with someone?  Please.

Nope, you could still decide your bag of coal was worth x amount of currency and as long as others within your trading route thought the same, the currency would have a value.  Not an internationally traded value, but a value all the same.
The advantage of currency is that you do not always have to bring barter to make a transaction.  You can agree that the bits of paper or coin you have is worth a certain amount of goods.  In a breakdown of society that value might fluctuate massively b ut it is a workable system.
However, if the internet goes down, your bitcoins stop existing alltogether.

I might consider moving banks, but I wouldn't be overly concerned.  The money is still there, people could still go into the bank and have access to their funds, it was a problem with their ATM's, not their entire IT infrastructure.  The backlog of ATM transactions comes from the U.K bank's policy of allowing other customers to use their ATM's (e.g. I can use my NatWest card in a Barclay's bank machine), so if their ATM system isn't properly working from its own machines it sure as hell isn't accepting information from outside sources.  This isn't the breakdown of international banking it's a major IT fault.


The only bank run in 150 years in the U.K. was Northern Rock, and the reason there was a bank run was because they actually admitted that they couldn't  cover their deposits, not because their ATM's stopped working.

A very interesting project but I have a few questions :


Do you guys have an NCAP rating?  Or perhaps you can provide details of the safety testing you have gone through?


What X-prize did you win?  [This]( image shows you didn't even get past the shakedown stage.  Anybody doubting that picture can go to:
And uncheck the boxes for the alternative (tandem) and alternative (side by side).
You weren't even considered for the prize so how can you come 10th?  Or win anything?
In fact, looking through the whole autoxprize site, you didn't even post *ANY* data on your car at all.  Meaning you didn't even qualify for any of their events.  Also the last time this event was held was two years ago which makes me wonder what you've been up to in the mean time?  And also why you don't mention the two year delay in any of your marketing stuff?
@_date: 2012-08-28 03:37:47
Awesome quote, I still don't see anything about less than $10 million anywhere.

And how exactly do you validate your transaction without a network?

Companies that get arrest warrants, then take 50% of the value of the money that was already stolen upfront and "bring them in"?
Is this some sort of fucking awful fanfic?
Stop your bullshitology.

My friend, anyone can refuse your business, you could walk into a shop and be asked to leave for no reason, a website can refuse your order, it isn't a grand conspiracy.
Just a thought, but surely the campaign accepts bitcoins?  So why do they have to halt their campaign now?

Actually all it shows is it that when your ATM service is fucked, it causes all sorts of problems.
Remember that a bank is all sorts of exposed every day it trades, it borrows money from other banks to cover temporary positions, it's lending and trading its deposits and all sorts of other seemingly weird things.  It's not the customers that make a bank bankrupt it's other banks.  The interbank loans are the single greatest marker of a banks liquidity, if you fail to pay back one of those at the end of trading you are fucked.  That's what happened to Anglo Irish bank, I mean they were fucked before hand but they could hide it.  The second they failed to pay back the interbank loans they called the government and the central bank and explained they needed a shit ton of money, not to ensure their depositors but to pay back the banks they had loaned from.
Secondly banks are surprisingly lackadaisical about money and very able to suck up huge losses.  I've worked for two banks, I can tell you all sorts of stories about €100 million being "found" due to an error with an AS/400 machines database, or trying to call an international bank's Argentinian tech support people because their server was refusing to accept the card processing data we were trying to send it totalling $4.6 odd million, and it refused to take it for 9 days.
So saying that a glitch in a customer facing environment will lead to a bank run or bankrupt a major bank is ridiculous.

After waxing my moustache and twirling it just a bit... :)
I'd agree that businesses collude to avoid competition, it would be stupid not too, but I don't think bitcoin has reached the level that other payment processors would actively seek to shut it out.  Also Amazon does not have it's own currency, they don't even accept paypal.
Although I still feel sad that this project has been suspended, I thought it was a great idea.

Yeah, because no one else logged in at the same time, nor did anyone else log in at the same time and try to take advantage of the low price.
This guy came forward and explained his position.  Mt. Gox has changed their story multiple times, in fact, they've changed their version of events so many times it is hard to keep up with what their current version of events is.

Well in all honesty, it seemed that your reply dismissed gwern's queries, without answering them, by asking if he had any ideas.
I understand that it is hard to convey your intention in written form, as opposed to speaking to someone.  I guess your reply, at least to me, came off as combative and did not address the points made.
But, as I said, that might be a limitation of the written word rather than your intent .
@_date: 2011-06-23 03:29:12
So if all the people who had 0.01 and 0.1 buys orders in are just as guilty then?  Wow they are all hackers.
Because a lot of those people had *extremely* low offers in well before the price dipped below $1.

Then what happens when regulation is enacted regarding bitcoin?  If legislation is ever passed outlawing bitcoin in certain areas (which is a possibility), what then?
@_date: 2011-06-01 16:42:23
Criticising something does not mean that you need to provide a solution. 
Nor does not having a solution invalidate your criticism.
@_date: 2011-06-23 03:31:33
Even that would not prove anything, the price was dropping unbelievably quickly.
Many people had buys less than Kevin well before the price hit $1.

I'm sure the author is very successful in paying for things with Bitcoin in a country with historically awful internet. Right?
Also this statement is where you should stop listening to the author:


Why exactly?  The volatility is in fact extremely important.  If I buy a cow from you, using my magical Rwandan internet device and pay you in bitcoins, but then those bitcoins are worth 50% less than they were the day before, you've just lost a shitload of money.

Pay as you go credit cards exist, Mastercard do them
What's more difficult, walking into my local shop and buying a card with €50 on it and walking out with a card that is pretty much accepted universally, or registering with an exchange, buying some bitcoins whose value fluctuates and which isn't very accepted?
Which is easier do you think?
