Thanks - this stuff is pretty confusing...
I guess that's what they call the 'non-qualified distribution' then?... so they hit you hard with tax + penalty if you touch *your own goddamn money* before 59 1/2. 
In addition to that, I'm just reading that GBTC usually trades at premium over BTC price (often 20% or more). 
So I guess hodling your BTC directly is the winning option for the 45yo.
However - it could still be preferable to go GBTC in a Roth for a 55yo.. if they are risk-tolerant, and buy GBTC when the premiums drop less than 10%. When BTC ETFs come along, the premium issue should be moot.

Cops don't show up at your door from a SAR (suspicious activity report), but banks do (and are required) to submit a quota of them... so I guarantee you they do. I'm sure banks don't want to be fined, for not complying.
That said... govt bureaucracies receiving thousands of SAR reports doesn't mean cops or IRS flag you. It may increase your risk, but it's also likely you wind up in a stack.

I agree.  Bitcoin can't be called a "bubble", any more stocks or bonds... which people invest in as brainless reflex.
People throw money into stocks (tax-protected retirement accounts), as "store of value" to escape the shrinking USD. If stock market has a scare, there's now a new choice other than gold, cash, or bonds.
Similarly, people/nations have been buying US treasury bonds as store of value. US debt (and cost of debt) is already sky high. How much printing money, leveraging bank reserves, or manipulating interest rates before the USD loses enough confidence to drive people to alternatives? Those alternatives being... stocks, gold, real estate, and now - bitcoin.
Bitcoin is an entirely new asset class, so it's going to be telling to watch people's behavior as the cracks deepen in the overleveraged fractional reserve and inflationary printed paper fiat money system. There's a new option, which I think can act as competitiion and an "escape hatch" to the fraudulent experiment which the world's governments have been doing for the past century.

Read Ludwig von Mises. 
Murray Rothbard is also excellent.
For a shorter read, try "The Creature from Jekyll Island"
Nutshell history lesson: 
Gold was money for most of human history. Inflation during Roman times was from emperor melting coins down and minting with cheaper metals (making more coins for self). This wasn't because Roman economists as advised it... It was because printing/minting money is what those is power do. Today is no different. So, if you think counterfeit and stealing is bad... then you should think inflation is bad. If you think "but muh public school taught me inflation is necessary", you should ask who drives that agenda.
Bonus points: ask how many ETH there will be?

Wow - that's useful info when I dump my forks, so thanks... Will use it.
I'm not trying to do that now, just learn how to manage SW addresses.
I write some small open source utilities on GitHub, and would like to make them SW compatible... once I understand it.

1) generate new SW/bech32 addresses
2) send my coins there
After that point... I'll see lower fees, if I'm understanding.
I don't really want to use the 32 word seed for various reasons (I prefer to BIP38 passphrase encrypt individual keys for long term storage), so I'm hoping Electrum or some wallet will support sweeping and spending SW.

that wouldn't be so bad.
but still, I don't think that level of banning will happen.
The US power structure will not feel threatened, so long as they can capture majority of taxes. Sure... banks and credit card industry could be disrupted, just like digital media disrupted record industry. 
But... for W-2 forms etc, it doesn't matter.
Employers paying in bitcoin would still deduct for IRS.
If bitcoin reaches that level of adoption... the price would eventually stabilize, just like gold.
The power taken away from Federal Reserve would be dramatic (ending that 100 year failed experiment), but there are conservative/republicans who would support that. There would be massive deleveraging as USD needs to stop inflating w/ debt. In the end, govt will do what it needs to... to take it's cut, and  bitcoin could become a new global currency without cornering the powers that be into banning it.
In this extreme adoption scenario, bitcoin could reach up to $150T market cap... reaching price of $7M/btc in today's dollars.

scroll down... replied under Bootleg's post (as to why I think buying pressure is done short term).
As for LN adoption, let's just think back to when bitcoin was 0.1 cent transactions...
Were your local deli and coffee shops rushing to accept it? No way. Why would that be different now?
Don't get me wrong - eventually, they ALL will accept it... but bitcoin is still volatile and confusing to normies.
I tried to get a local hamburger shop to accept bitcoin (as well as a few other shops).
The comment from the burger shop tho... I'll never forget. He says "I love bitcoin, but you think these idiots I hire for minimum wage can do this? I can barely train them to take an order for fries. Sorry guy"
Gonna take time... like a couple years at least for mainstream normies to trickle in.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:37:46
Yup - but that's it.
Nations can ban commerce and exchange, in their territory.
There will always be a nation that permits it. Enough nations have shitty currencies or hate the USD, that embracing bitcoin is a nice FU to the powers disrupted by it.
Even if the US out right banned it... I can take my vacations or retire to nation that embraces it. These nations will become wealthier as a result. Gotta love free markets, which Bitcoin forces. 
The more govt bans, the more shit I buy online or on dark web (not drugs, but maybe a plunger or toaster off purse.io type site hosted in West Indies). Or maybe P2P type LBC or Bisq type services sprout and flourish with a ban. Alcohol prohibition didn't stop people drinking either

That's interesting.
I had similar thought, that Bitcoin python libraries are juicy targets... which is actually why I wrote this transparent short code. (avoiding Bitcoin libraries)
Base58 library is so commonly, generically used... doesn't seem like a good attack, but 1) base58 can easily be tested that it's not spitting out hardcoded results, and 2) this code (or any key generation) should ever be run on a PC that will ever touch a network... if one smart and paranoid.
You got me thinking(paranoid) actually... that best attack on this script would be hardcoded results from os.urandom ... A good addition to this script would be loop on.urandom for 10 minutes checking for duplicates, to verify its not compromised.
Or, we can always just do the dice &amp; paper method...

Gold is good comparison right now, but as LN takes hold... the utility will surpass gold, and we'll better compare it to M1 worldwide. ($50T at least)

The latter will depend on what approach governments take... cooperative or oppressive.

Why would the Fed "dump bonds"?
Private and foreign holders could do it, which would drive up interest and inflation.
This seems inevitable. Inflation usually drives up the stock market, and I think if people dump bonds... that would happen but stock gains would be flat against inflation.
Bitcoin and gold would do well in this scenario, as they are alternative stores of value.

Thats nothing.... US Govt debt is $20T. Global govt debt $50T.
What happens when, for the first time in over a century, the world has a scarcity backed money... instead of printed inflationary fiat? 
People will learn they do not prefer to hold govt fiat. Even stocks and gold will have competition as store of value. Bitcoin is an escape hatch from the leveraged counterfeit system, which will drive up interest rates for govt bonds. This is a cycle which could lead to major economic disruption. Expect "bitcoin speculation" to become a scapegoat in this turmoil. There will be reactionary attacks from the left. Debt and leverage has a healthy place is society, but central banks have fed the beast and there will be serious pain in deleveraging.

Government shall instead, suffocate it with regulation, claiming "protecting people"... which koolaid-drinking sheeple normie bootlickers swallow thankfully.

Diverging from original thread - but good topic...
Why I like BIP38... It is pretty standard. You can Google it, and even some wallets support it.
This is important to me because, as a hodler, I don't need change addresses or a seed wallet. I simply need:
1) a single 1-time use address, that holds my money
2) a good obscure passphrase that my family will know if I die.
That way, if I croak... my wife or kids (who don't do Bitcoin) could follow the breadcrumbs to retrieve it.
I can and do back this up multiple places. Heck, with a good BIP 38 passphrase, I'm comfortable framing it on the wall... or posting it here. Nobody can brute force it.
I don't know this openssl method you mention, but curious what that is. For me to change, my cold storage... it would have to be more ubiquitous, Google-able, and luddite-proof than BIP 38

Fraud and theft are things you could pursue remediation for.
Trademarks fit within the fraud category.
Copyright doesn't really have a valid basis in libertarian/anarchist world (depending who you ask). Reputation becomes the way that plagiarizers and copycats get punished. People can always protect their content through subscriptions and other complicated means... if they want to attempt to maintain control over information.

No really good tumblers exist.
Best immediate anonymity option: bitcoin -&gt; Changelly -&gt; Monero -&gt; xmr.to -&gt; Bitcoin
To do this, you need to download and run monero wallet. You can connect to remote-daemon node... if you want to avoid hassle of syncing monero blockchain.
This whole process is not for newbs. Try with small amount first.
In my opinion, everyone should do this with all coins... Immediately after buying them.
I won't go into detail why, but do you want your future txns traceable?
I think/hope better options will exist within Bitcoin ecosystem soon... Perhaps LN related anonymity services. This is the biggest missing feature from Bitcoin atm

2) Send coin through a trusted/P2P type mixing service supporting LN
3) service sends to your new channel... which could be closed to new address

You need to consider more than just global M1 (cash &amp; bank deposits).
You need consider debt as well. I think "all the money in the world" comes closer to $150T when you include debt. There will still be debt/loans/IOUs with Bitcoin... but you can't multiply money supply via fractional reserves with Bitcoin (not unless people accept IOUs from banks instead of Bitcoin, no thank you).
This is why you sometimes hear $1M+ targets for Bitcoin price in a hyperbitcoinized world. (my math gives $8M/BTC upper limit, in today's dollars).

This is very interesting!
Curious... How does it different from other mixers/tumblers? (Or does it?)
I understand that mixing creates obscurity, but analysis may still be able to trace.
I thought that BTC-XMR-BTC is currently the only truly private way to go.. (separating time &amp; amounts on the way back to BTC).
Looking forward to projects like these and mimblewimble further out... to give bitcoin the feature it is missing: privacy.

there is no utopian system, only enlightened culture.

Like Bcash? put your money in it then suckers. You obviously have zero understanding of scaling... and deserve what the market will reward you with.
Similarly, quit the whining about "insider trading" or "marker manipulation". In a free market, everybody is a big boy, and govt regulation is for pussies.
if you understand bitcoins value, you should welcome dips as buying opportunities.

Remember SW is only THREE MONTHS OLD.
The sky is not falling. Maybe its fate that high school kids cant put lunch money in bitcoin because of txn fees. Blockchain is permanent, so txns SHOULD cost something.
I also think that small blocks will help LN adoption. Right now, bitcoin cannot and should not be used for buying coffee. LN is for that, and it will be here soonish.
I think it is time to start evaluating sensible conservative block increase strategy... which should be bundled with other positive HF updates. Even if bitcoin is digital gold for big money... it is going to need bigger blocks to support increased user adoption.

code bounties are an awesome charitable cause.
see bountysource or similar sites
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:22:02
Here's an idea... How about donate to BITCOIN?
Donate to politicians who are friendly (Rand Paul) and donate against enemies(Feinstein, Schumer)
Donate to code bounties for programmers who fix bugs and add features.
Invest in companies that are building the ecosystem.
Good God, don't just GIVE the money to poor and downtrodden. That might be nice, but it won't make the world a better place.
Capitalism and free markets raise everyone's boat. Bitcoin is the first best chance economic revolution has seen in a loooong time. Support neglected principles: liberty, individualism, sovereignty. Fight serfdom, tyranny, and corruption. So much good you can do... So much.
 Congrats, good luck, and thanks for listening.

Ditto OP, great post.
I'll admit... I regrettably sold some at $4k, because my wife is a luddite who hounded me to recoup initial investment.
I did that (plus a bit) so pressures off from her now, and I plan to hodl til 2020+ at least.
I will hodl if it drops to $2k or goes to $50k... because I KNOW it's value is higher.
Wish I wore the pants in the house and hadn't sold, but derp.

My older bro is an MBA and with UC Berkeley engineering degree.
He's very successful and smart, yet... I've been trying to teach him the beauty of bitcoin for a few years.
He's finally kicking himself for not buying when I said, but he STILL doesn't get it. He says things like "It's not backed by anything", "government might not allow it", etc.
It takes a certain skepticism of status quo and yearning for revolution, to understand and love bitcoin.

Anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism (which Satoshi certainly was one of BTW) does not prescribe "public" services. Private markets can provide cops, courts, roads, etc. (money too).

CoinBase has been co-opted or intimidated by the Deep State, to promote BCash in a "divide &amp;  conquer" strategy against Bitcoin
This strategy will ultimately fail of course, but is it any coincidence that CoinBase has pseudo-monopoly on retail exchange service? CoinBase is playing ball, to ensure licensed competitors are kept at bay by regulators...

The difference with the US colonists.. They had power to resist. Their ruler was across an ocean, and did not have superior arms (a musket is a musket).
Our US government is entrenched with militarized police, massive surveillance, and the largest prison population in the world. If that don't work, just label them a "terrorist" and send them to the dungeon(Gitmo) without a trial. Maybe thats where Satoshi is at now.
Two words: Donald Trump.

An API that reads/writes identity ratings onto blockchain could be useful.
Sort of like what onename was doing on namecoin, but they switched to Bitcoin blockchain with the blockstack effort (claiming namecoin was not robust enough).
Zeronet does authentication using bitcoin style addresses (not stored on blockchain).
Seems if you combined all these, you could have an awesome oauth-style identity w/ reputation... Completely decentralized on the blockchain. That would be nice, if its possible

LN improves privacy substantially. Waiting for the atomic swaps with XMR.
The hardest part about privacy right now, is that paranoia is exhausting.
I once tried to convert Bitcoin to Monero in NSA-traceless way just to prove I could: WhoNix VM, Changelly and throwaway Protonmail via Tor, Xmr.to back to a new wallet... Then I think I ordered something with it shipped to my home, so fuck me. I think Bisq would have been easier BTC-XMR if I try again. Running private Monero wallets are not nearly as user friendly as Bitcoin, so I agree built in privacy is needed. 
I heard about MimbleWimble and other proposals, but they all seem conceptual at best or forking into shitcoins. 2nd layer seems easiest way to "lose your tail". The way government and normies sheeple think these days, anyone who wants privacy "has something to hide". They'll brand sidechains as "laundering". Well fuck them, cypherpunk for life! Built in privacy for all or bust. Cash has it, so can digital cash Bitcoin.

you said it... "they find your seed, they have it all"
Here is BIP38 encrypted key, with 1 BTC on it.
It's yours... all you have to do is guess my passphrase.
Here's a hint - it's the name of my first crush.
See... I will always remember that passphrase. It's in my brain, I don't need to write it down. I can post that BIP38 on the internet, on a napkin, on my fridge, doesn't matter.
Meanwhile, your Trezor seed card? You can't remember that bunch of words... so you're forced to hide it, and and remain constantly paranoid it's not lost or stolen.
BIP38 beats hardware wallets. The guy below who said Tails USB, that's what I do. Never generate keys while connected to internet, and never reuse address after spending from large amount wallet. Simple and foolproof.

 You realize that *everything* comes from land, right?
The cotton in your clothes, the plants on your plate.
Property comes from work. Work the land and actively use it, its your property... by using/improving it. You can own land. 
That said, putting a fence around square miles of unused land is NOT an anarchocapitalist view. 'Squatters rights' is a common law concept, which is how property rights should derive by and large.

I don't like the idea of storing my BitCoins on a big cloud target (MtGox/BitPay/etc), but I don't like keeping private keys lying around either.
I built this as a personal solution, and wanted to share.
It's a utility to password hash your private key on a paper wallet for storage. I tried to design this, so (should I get hit by a bus).. then my luddite wife could figure out how to retrieve the coin.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:06:51
In addition to BIP38 paper printed wallet, you may want to store soft-copy in a Veracrypt(formerly Truecrypt) file offsite... in case of fire or theft.
I added a "passphrase hint" on my wallets, so my wife could retrieve coins by guessing passphrase if I croak.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:27:13
I didn't know that BIP38 feature at bitcoinpaperwallet.com existed, until now. I will definitely check it out, and evaluate if I should switch from Blowfish to BIP38. 
The reason I chose Blowfish, is because I wanted to support decouple the wallet from any particular tool. When I Google "decrypt Blowfish online"... I got a few hits, so it seemed I would have options to decrypt in a jam. If bitcoinpaperwallet.com goes down, I wouldn't want to be stuck. However if BIP38 is a ""standard" supported by a few wallet apps... its better, and I'll probably rework it.
Off hand, the other thing I don't like about their tool...  Is it smacks bitcoin logos all over it. If I want to add a bitcoin label to mine I can, but I'd rather it appear cryptic to the novice burglar or lookie-loo.
I suppose I could use the BIP38 tool and just print out on mine, since all the my html does is format QR, hint, and text for printing.
Okay thanks - some things for me to chew on.

My wife and I have a lot of inside jokes, so thinking of obscure but easily recalled password hints wasn't tough.
As far as losing it... I plan to print+hide physical and also store JPG copies in a Veracrypt(formerly Truecrypt) vault in the cloud.
I would split bitcoin amongst several different wallets with different hints, so any brute force approach would be more effort intensive to get them all. 
Of course, you can always crop off the address so a thief could not know how much coin is there worth taking.
Besides, thinking of passwords was fun. I quizzed my wife with the hints and she got them all.

Roger earned some respect back from me, for the mature discussion. As a fellow an-cap, voluntaryist like Roger... I respect his motives and integrity are good.
I just think his architectural perspective on what Bitcoin needs right now is off....he's wrong to support big blocks.
I used to be like him... thinking merchant adoption is needed ASAP.
There is no coin that can scale to Visa's txn volume, until LN.
If you're going to scale, do it correctly... Don't create bloat and pollution for the ecosystem by dumping coffee purchases on the blockchain. They don't belong there, and I am certain Satoshi would agree at this point in time.

let's think this through then...
lets make it easier, lets say that nuclear bombs went off in 3 major cities killing millions and it was proven to be funded by bitcoin
suddenly, you may popular support to ban it. there would still be libertarian opposition, but lets say all arms of major 1st world governments wanted to ban
they could certainly start blocking bitcoin nodes by IP,  with sever punishment. there may even be nations that did not cooperate, but they could threaten sanctions on those "terrorist" nations.
they could shut down miners or perhaps take them over to 51% attack the network. btc may try to hard fork and survive. 
they could drive btc into the shadows but it would be like a cockroach, and they would spend so much capital (political and otherwise) that they would not exterminate it completely. (all it takes is one copy to survive &amp; multiply!)
given time and correction of public opinion, its even likely btc would make a resurgance over time.
many ways to spin this scenario, but can you KILL bitcoin?
no, that cockroach honey badger aint going nowhere

@_date: 2019-11-10 21:38:04
im not being sarcastic....
im talking about scenarios where sovereign governments tried to create national coins. they could even ban bitcoin for retail, force citizens to use said coin within borders.
a main benefit of bitcoin/blockchain is being "trustless". since govts dont trust eachother (wouldnt use eachothers coin), theyd obviously use bitcoin to xfer large amounts across borders. The "trustless" way to do this (without relying on escrow, central banks, middlemen) is to code support for exchange (which afaik is atomic swaps).

it takes a moron to think that Satoshi created bitcoin to "cash out" in one fell swoop and crash the market.... instead of birthing a money revolution for idealogical purposes.
I'm sure Satoshi has enough coins we don't know about to live rich... and if he wants to spend genesis coins also, so be it.

you need hashpower for security and stability... but how much is enough?

it is certainly not hashpower... even if they correlate.

I'm an an-cap/libertarian and in IT, so heard of Bitcoin early and liked/followed it... but shamefully, I waited too long to buy, confounded by FUD
- Government will squash it
- Something better will replace it
- My wife scoffed at it "it's not real"
- One of my (otherwise smart) banker/investment friends ridiculed it, stalling me past the 2012/2013 pre-spike
Got in 2015 dip though (without telling my wife) and have been a nuts-of-steel hodler since.
Confessed the purchase to my wife once it went up, and she couldn't be mad... but has hounded me to sell, quieting down as price goes up up up. I consider that a test of my resolve as a man.
It's funny that now the friends &amp; family who gave me FUD are asking me for advice and looking to buy.

Small block: the smallest possible size to carry *legitimate* throughout (i.e. not temporary big blocker spam attacks), considering maximum adoption of scaling strategies like 1) protocol efficiencies (e.g. segwit, schnorr), and 2) 2nd layer standards (e.g. LN)
So, given that segwit isn't activated until this week... setting a target date for 2X increase is premature, and thus... part of the big blocker agenda.

Could do something so the output never goes through clipboard or screen... so no chance of it being stolen (even on a compromised PC).
I would probably add BIP38 passphrasing as an input... with random keyboard input translation, so even a keylogger would be stifled.

Satoshi gave bitcoin life, nursed it, weaned it into an open source project, then rode off into the sunset.
It's no surprise that he went dark Dec 2010... shortly after bitcoin demonstrated growing monetary value &amp; network strength, becoming newsworthy. Anyone who started such a project, amassing numerous firstcomer coins, would be wise to disappear - given government's record of attacking such individuals.
I do not think Satoshi will ever spend the coins associated with him.
I imagine he has a stash of coins he procured via other identities, and is quite rich enough off those. Perhaps, years from now, his heirs will inherit &amp; split the initial coins... or they will be dispersed in charitable and creative ways in acts of good will.
Anyone who work so hard to invent such a revolutionary system, must have had strong ideals (libertarian, free market)... so I suspect while money was surely a motivator, it was not his primary motivator. He wanted to change the world.

"no $2 miner fee" means per txn. you still have that for blockchain  txns, but likely reduced near term anyways w segwit capacity increase + more txn moving offchain
Sure, LN operators may charge a service fee for merchants... but it could be dramatically cheaper than credit cards or bitpay.

that would be 90% drop from ATH
that would be bigger than any drop seen yet.
Even the 2015 low of ~$180 was a blip in trading that quickly retraced back to ~$270
70% drops from ATH has been the low point... which is about $6k
I never thought Bitcoin would go that high in 2017 but now that it has... I think $2k is very unlikely. There's not much bad news other than price. Lots of good news on innovation. I feel bad for anyone who sells.

You have obviously never worked in business that dealt with credit card payments.
The cost of fees and PCI compliance and fraud is far more burdensome than simple math of conversion rates. 
That said, businesses don't do things unless it attracts customers... So business won't adopt Bitcoin because they want to. They'll do it for competitive advantage.
Bitcoin mass adoption will not be to buy coffee, it will be because it's superior money - i.e. store of value. Once enough people hold it, enough people want to spend/use it... and I will go to Arco instead of Chevron if it's across the street and accepts my preferred payment method. These preferences eventually snowball into new standard acceptance... (I.e. if even 5-10% of customers prefer Bitcoin, and cost to accept is minimal... then every business must accept it or suffer economic consequences)
If a business doesn't want to hold Bitcoin, that's a trivial auto-conversion problem that Coinbase, BitPay, and others solve if needed.

Bitcoin is not private, but things are improving...
- Wallets like Wasabi wallet, that make CoinJoin convenient
- LN onion routing
- Atomic swaps for easier exchange with privacy coins/chains
- Schnorr signatures with Taproot, Bulletproof and other improvements which make privacy (merging or obfuscating inputs) easier
- neutrino wallets, so you don't give up your addresses every time you open your wallet.
I do not think on-chain anonymity needs to be default (like Monero), but one should certainly be able to deter chain analysis at will, easily.
It's still ridiculously difficult to ensure privacy if you don't buy your coins in a back alley with cash, and that's a big problem. If you exchange to Monero, the tax thieves may try to argue some "like kind exchange" nonsense... 
Privacy is a goddamn natural right, and anybody who says otherwise can suck my big fat nunyabiznass.

how does selling a house with bitcoin work?
I recall a ridiculous amount of paperwork selling/buying a house... mostly around disclosure, stupid laws, etc.

I've had similar situation with my brother and father, who are intelligent and economical people.

No- but I think skepticism is deserved on the case against Ross... considering that the State's obvious motives in this case:
\- make an hard example of this man who dared challenge "muh war on drugs"
\- he has lots of bitcoin we can steal... so let's ensure case stacked so high he bends over and shits coins
Enough similarities with Assange... "enemy of the state" conveniently accused of rape. They had witnesses. However... reports/rumors of manipulated witness abound.
Be skeptical of said alleged witnesses/case of the Hitman, which was not actually charged. Clearly came across as a smear tactic... to perpetuate this "violent crime lord" story.
If you look at Ross, his family... IMHO I find it highly out of character, those charges of murder. He was a libertarian idealist and smart kid... not El Chapo.

Question on Wasabi -
It generates many small outputs of "mixed coin". Can you be deanonymized by recombining these outputs?
I would think chainanalysis could say "that coin split into 0.0912 and 0.923" ... then a day later, "we see two inputs of same amount combined in new transaction".
I'm not familar enough with coinjoin... how common are those small amounts, and is recombining a no-no? I would think that if coinjoin works within a common set of outputs (i.e. there hundreds of outputs of 0.912.... then recombining isn't a giveaway, because other mixers got same amounts and look the same as you). I'm really hoping/expecting the creators of coinjoin, who are much smarter than me, thought this through. :-D
Thanks to [for making Bitcoin fungible.

Ok, so that sort of circumstantial combining is avoidable... (don't recombine your 6.9 coins back into 6.9 total after mixing).
I was wondering about if merging even portions of UTXOs (say a few of the total) hurt anonymity, because the UTXOs appear to be unique. They are not all 0.09... they are 0.0912, 0.0923, 0.0934, etc.. and is that uniqueness a risk to recombine?
When you send in 6.9 coins - you get 69 UTXOs which are unique. Let's say user just merges those in bundles of 0.5 coin (5 UTXOs each). Now, could chainalysis say... "well, look that 0.0912 was merged with 0.0934... so I can see that they probably came from this common source back up the chain".
Sorry - this question is hurting my head to even explain, but probably because I don't understand coinjoin well.

This is an important topic.
Of that list, I see these as the potentially threatening ones:
- Powerful organizations may invest in a permanent 51% mining majority.
- governments can vote to criminalize the use and posession of Bitcoin by imposing impossibly high fines and jail 
The others would either affect the Internet as a whole, raising public opposition... Or lead to a cat&amp;mouse game where Bitcoin would use encryption to dodge censorship.
This one however, is interesting.
-Central banks, in a spur of creative insight, may push a government-approved Bitcoin fork to all banking consumers. It would go mainstream by default.
Would this be good or bad for Bitcoin? Could you really fork Bitcoin mainstream without making bitcoiners extremely rich? Would bank fork it then steal assets, making it worthless in the public eye?

Bitcoin is all about decentralization &amp; openness. We should strive to make the bitcoin ecosystem open source, crowd-sourced, and non-proprietary.

Feel free to use anything from there. The more of us helping and teaching the better.
----------part to cut
Since one whole Bitcoin does have a value upwards of $300, depending on demand, a bitcoin can be broken down up to 8 decimal places to make purchasing, and sending smaller amounts possible. 
Some of these bitcoin buying services can also act as a wallet, but unlike one of the wallets listed above, most of these service do require your basic information, so your privacy will be jeopardized. So we do recommend sending to your personal wallet after purchasing.

All fair points.
I fully acknowledge someone else's chart would look different. My goal with post was to get feedback and try to correct it best I can... and read interesting discussion. I realize the chart oversimplifies things, but nobody reads complicated charts.
On 'store of value', I'm just considering fiat inflation... with volatility separate.
On 'unregulated', I consider that good... but some may not. For benefits regulation supposedly brings (protect consumers, fraud protection), I think some of that is on other rows.

@_date: 2019-12-17 05:01:41
Thats an interesting take...
I guess the only problem I'd pose is, what if Satoshi doubled or quadrupled the halving speed?
(most coins would have been mined first couple years). Would bitcoin be worth way more, simply due to higher scarcity &amp; stock-flow?
Maybe, maybe not. I just think there are other factors: stability, trust, cultural readiness, supporting ecosystem... which take some years. 
I think of price in terms of value... and value in terms of metcalfes law.
I.e. its not demand or supply, its both.
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:54:17
Yet, knowing what one wants to tip beforehand isn't very easy... especially given the nature of this site, and that after 10-20min confirmation, the "mood" is may be lost on either side of the camera.
@_date: 2015-08-14 06:29:36
I sense that some great bitcoin-size epic innovation is just around the corner... in terms of distributed P2P applications.
You've got maidsafe, ethereum, openname(can store key-value), now tau-chain (maybe there are others I'm not naming?)
The impetus seems clear, and it's exciting that we could be entering a true age of freedom... with decentralized application data. Apps like OpenBazaar built on such a platform, could really multiply &amp; accelerate.
I don't know whether that platform is here yet, or what it will look like exactly.
It definitely needs to be flexible, and easy to build on. I wonder/hope it's possible to do without inventing a new alt-coin.

Brick &amp; mortar 1st world nations... I'd be curious how many merchants say YES/NO when offered gold vs bitcoin. They would be apprehensive whether gold was real.
Online, bitcoin is clear winner for acceptance. So I would disagree, and say bitcoin is more practically accepted for wider purposes than gold.

Anyone suspicious this is Step 1 of a two step propaganda war against bitcoin by those threatened by it?
CC companies will lobby DC to squash BTC.
This gives them the "Look, Bitcoin is used for sex trafficking" card to play.
Politicians use emotions and crises (real or not) to meet their ends.
Let's face it, sex trafficking is a largely exaggerated crisis... concocted by feminists, social conservatives, and other penis police. This happened 100 years ago with "white slavery" scare.
Public are biting, so its a smart play by CCs.

Hold up.
You guys are recognizing that these girls meet strangers behind closed doors for sex... Yet you're concerned about safety meeting nerds at well-lit public places to trade small amounts of cash for Bitcoin??
NO. I'm not worried about safety. It's no more dangerous than any Craigslist transaction, such as buying a toaster. These girls are just making a living. 
As for legal concerns, I'm confident in my instincts.
If I feel the Feds are setting up a KYC sting for a $40 local Bitcoin exchange at McDonalds, there will be a few things wrong with that picture. ...and quite honestly, I find personal satisfaction in breaking stupid ass laws
@_date: 2015-07-20 07:23:00
This is why I don't feel comfortable with all the bitcoin trades for gift cards.
Seems like fraud &amp; CC theft is likely to be involved behind those gift cards... and when a charge back comes, which leaves you empty handed.
Trade with individuals face-to-face (Mycelium, or LBC).
Otherwise, LibertyX or other exchange reduces exposure.
I have no problem with Purse.io, because you have your goods on your porch... before you release escrow coins.
I have no problem with Foldapp, because I buy in line at Starbucks and have my hot cup of coffee in hand in two minutes... regardless of where gift card came from.

They were very nice and appreciative. It felt satisfying to teach someone bitcoin, and see them walk away happy.
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:44:53
Govt will regulate/license bitcoin as strictly as possible.
Any infringement will result in confiscation.
They won't ban it outright of course, because then they couldn't auction off what they confiscate.
All of this will be done in the name of protecting us from evil bitcoin druglords, terrorists, and backpage sex traffickers.

I don't think holding bitcoin is what scares people.

Your bitcoin doesn't like Starbucks even?
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:56:57
All good points. Thanks
* Fees - I considered ATM fees for cash, but true.
* Store of value - Mostly just going by USD &amp; fiat, but CC's don't apply since they don't store value... just charge interest on balance.
* Ease of use - I suppose I consider cash not highest, because you have to count exact change... withdraw from ATMs.
* Theft/fraud - yes, this was a hard one to compare. Theft can happen many ways. I suppose CC's are safe for consumer, not merchant. Cash &amp; gold are not safe from street crime. Bitcoin is theoretically safe, if you are smart &amp; protect private keys.
* Private/anonymous - True, maybe gold &amp; cash are highest here, compared to blockchain. I just considered that bitcoin get bonus for allowing internet transactions... whereas cash/gold require face-to-face.
* Regulated - true, perhaps I should be 'potential to evade regulation'.

They're freaked by backpage, banks, or both (in the industry they're in)... so for whatever reason they prefer credit/debit card.

Of course BP is going to claim the opposite in a lawsuit. 
Over time some escorts will slowly and stubbornly learn Bitcoin, and a broader userbase is the best thing for Bitcoin ecosystem... no matter what class.

That aside, I like fundamentals over chart zigzags. If I read correctly, his last article predicts a fall below $3200.
Possible? Sure, but I see a stubborn $5-6k bottom at... with sloooow rise back. just guessing.
Lots of factors:
The halving is 6 months away. In the past, thats predicated rise not fall. The market prices in supply drops early. Theres a weird seasonality to bitcoin price, (maybe people buy with tax refunds). Optimism in dollar and stocks might go up, if/when impeach and tradewar jitters subside. That could send Bitcoin lower near term.

This one is commonly used
See the BIP38 check box on tab 2
Best practice is to use disconnected PC, in case network is compromised... Cannot read clipboard to send keys somewhere.
Another good practice might be to use obscure passphrase with a "hint" to remind you, and write on the wallet... To prevent forgetting passphrase. (E.g. if your passphrase is "chocolate scrambled eggs", hint written might be "the grossest thing I ever cooked while stoned in college"). Because BIP38 uses slow encryption.. it would take a million years to brute force

I think Bitcoin would vastly reduce the money multiplier effect, if people hold their keys. Bitcoin eliminates the main use case of banks "don't wanna hide bags of cash under my bed"
Coinbase could be the new bank, for those who don't want to hold their keys.
Coinbase could be insolvent today already "Let us sell you BTC and store that safely for you... mmmkay?"
My bank pays almost nothing in interest. Why would I keep on a Coin Bank unless they pay me something worth the worry? Banks are gonna still exist, but the industry would be CRUSHED by a BTC world

"It does not" what?
Most wallets want to be initialized with either 12 word seed (BIP39) or master private key(xprv,yprv,zprv) (BIP 32).
BIP38 (passphrase encryption) implementations expect a single private key (not xprv,yprv,zprv).
So, I'm not seeing any supported standard for passphrase encryption of a seed or master private key. (Electrum passphrase encrypts wallet file, but that's not standard across wallets)

There are laws of physics... like tectonic plates build enough pressure to break friction causing an earthquake. These same dynamics are analogous to market crashes/corrections.
To say there are no forces involved in markets is not realistic. The Invisible Hand. Markets can't boom forever away from fundamentals. People have eyes and ears and brains. Sure, it's psychology and herd mentality, but there are tethers to underlying fundamentals in a complex system which seeks equilibrium.
Bitcoin has a an objective potential value, and a subjective perceived value.
Those who invest closest to the potential value are the ones who make money. If you invest when everyone else "gets it", it's too late.

That logic(overpopulation) could justify euthanasia same as abortion... Not really consistent with liberty.
The pro-choice pro-liberty view is that, everyone owns their own body.
A fetus is actually a parasite on the woman's body, since it cannot survive on it's own.
If there was a way to save the fetus without harming the mother, and someone was willing to pay for it... then great, do the pro-life thing and out it in an incubator. However, if the mother wants the "person" removed, then it's not her responsibility if it cannot survive outside.

15% fee of bitcoinIRA.com is stupid.
I'm currently going through setting a self-directed IRA.
It's sort of complicated process, but they're walking me through it. I paid $1300 initial fee for the service, plus there will be $100 annual fee. They act as custodians, and create an LLC for you (mine is registered in South Dakota, even though I live in California). You create a bank account as "manager" of that LLC. They roll over money from your existing Roth IRA into the bank account (I opened new business checking account at Wells Fargo, using the docs they emailed me). From that point on... you can invest with that checking account. I just applied with GDAX and itBit to open institutional trading account, to buy bitcoin. Hope to have this all set up in another week or two.
It's a pain in the ass dealing with IRS rules, but I don't like the huge premiums of GBTC stock and I don't expect ETFs to come available soon (and if they do, you're too late... because price will go up on the news). So... I think the tax-free earnings from bitcoin should be nice when I'm 59 1/2, without the huge convenience fee of bitcoinIRA or GBTC.
I could always use this same account to trade stocks, or even buy real estate or something else..

This is a great question. Here's a totally different way to approach it... using Metcalfe's Law (value of system is square of it's users)
So if 1M Americans have bought Bitcoin today (averaging $5k each, for $5B total). Then, number of investors needs double or triple to approach that $60k/BTC (another $5B invested).
Sure lots of assumptions baked in, but the point is... does not need 6x investors to grow 6x.

I don't really understand why it's complicated.
My ignorant understanding... BIP 38 is just "slow" passphrase encryption. It's just a standard... to be supported by different wallets.
If there was a standard for slow passphrase encryption, it could be used on anything... private keys (segwit or not), haikus, favorite breakfast cereal
Seems there just needs to be a good abstracted slow passphrase encryption method that's broadly supported, and the ecosystem can use that (decoupled from segwit or not)
Again... excuse my ignorance, just trying to understand the challenge point.

short answer
if im stinking rich, i dont need all my coin
i can loan it out and make interest
in deflationary currency, interest pressure is negative.
e.g. i may charge you 20% interest for inflationary printed fiat.. to get same value later. Bitcoin, maybe equivalent is 1%
bitcoin way too volatile for this use. makes loans hard to calculate... but that will change
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:29:38
I've been estate planning, and looking for solution on this...
I like a BIP38 passphrase encrypted key, with hint that only the beneficiary could guess.
My problem is leaving to minor children, and leaving in a way that their guardian could not coerce my child to give up the passphrase.
One option is a custodial safe deposit box, that only the child could open at 18. The drawback there, is technology could change in 10 years.
I just need to find a good trustee, with specific instructions, and emphasis on *trust*.
Wish there was a better way, maybe smart contract driven way - e.g. sell at x price or after y date.

Back when Backpage stopped credit cards, suddenly had these ladies contacting me to get Bitcoin (off mycelium) - because they were forced to
Actually was annoying because they wanted more than I wanted to sell, so sent them off to a Bitcoin ATM in town. Thank God I replenished what I sold!
I taught them how to use it, and they were good after a couple tries.
They didn't understand it at all... And the 10min wait times frustrate new users (look forward to LN)
I guarantee that credit cards and checks are equally confusing to first time users, we just don't think about that because everybody does it. If more people use Bitcoin, random people will just accept it... because people are cliquey that way. They are scared of getting scammed if they are first

This is *exactly* what decentralized platforms need...
Decentralized core, with slick front ends for the masses.

OpenBazaar needs this.

Yup - the attackers would be obvious and users would fork to new chain, or new POW, or both.
There was controversy over ETH vs ETC fork, because smart contract got hacked. ETC supporters thought "you wrote shitty code, you should lose". It's equivalent to someone being careless with private keys.
If 51% attack occurred, there would be no such controversy. Everyone would support fork to maintain integrity of the system.

I think # of coinmap nodes is a better metric. Who *accepts* bitcoin?
I've been following that, and its maybr dozen a week perhaps (in the US). Slow growth, and I can't say how many *stop* accepting bitcoin per week.
That said, all it takes is one major player to announce bitcoin integration (e.g. major POS, google wallet) and you could get some critical mass. 
I think businesses are afraid the govt will target them (ala Charlie Shrem). I made my first bitcoin brick&amp;mortar purchase for Italian food last week... and the lady wouldn't shut up about how she pays her taxes. She obviously was paranoid I was some sort of sting, and said they did bitcoin because "her son was into it".
Bitcoin may be squashed by regulation into a black market or gray market niche, which is perfectly fine. It still represents freedom, and as govt becomes more onerous... Its use and value will grow.

Sure, different nature of concerns.
Bitcoin concerns are more like securing cash register so you don't get mugged.
Credit card concerns feel more like you've been asked to hold everyone else's wallet, and make sure none of them get stolen.

Yes I'm in Sac.
I just think of bitcoin like cash, so  I'd disagree with.
With credit card, (web payments) we actually transmit the information used for payment. With bitcoin, the network takes care of that. You never get the customers private key. I think that reduces a lot of liability. Its true the fraud protection is baked in w/ credit cards (hence the transaction fees and other inefficiencies).
A business has to make sure the don't get Gox'd for sure.... but we have armored cars coming twice a day to pick up cash. Same thing in my eyes with BitPay/Coinbase/etc any service that deposits balance to USD bank account.
Depending on the type of business you are, credit card liability is largely comprised of bad story in Sac Bee (and we are one of those companies).

Give it time.
The Stoopid Index is still way high (shitcoins % of market cap). Many hopes and dreams of getting rich quick still need to be crushed. That could take a year to shake out.
Crypto newbs and normies will realize  "what the fuck did I buy this shit for? I'm not getting rich. I could buy a house or car with my money instead, fuck this." First, shitcoins will fade deflating Bitcoin with them. Scamcoins will have no new suckers, and die.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin ecosystem will develop slowly... with LN adoption + next halving + new round of adoption spurring a new hype cycle in 2020.
All I know is... there is so much pump posting on r/bitcoin these days, I can barely come here any more. I read one more "Expert says Bitcoin could hit $100k in 2018" post, I am done. People who bought at $18k are so desperate.. they think pump posts on Reddit will help the price? Sorry guys, winter is coming. HODL and ride it out, or if you got in over your head... Learn from it.

See "Operation Choke Point"
That's the kind of crap government will not be able to do with bitcoin.
Just like Bitcoin competition forces Western Union to lower fees... Bitcoin forces government to limit its reach.
See 1920s alcohol prohibition.
Everyone still drank, it just became black market and the term "scofflaw" was invented. If govt tracks our phones, internet, spending, location... anti-govt scofflaw sentiment grows. Bitcoin gives people a channel to rebel. 
In some ways, government crackdown and financial oppression could actually be GOOD for bitcoin.

Meet Starbucks. 
You count cash, then pocket.
You send them coin.
You both sit and wait for a confirmation?
Am I missing any important precautionary best practice steps for either side?
If I'm buyer, would be concerned seller would dash with cash.
Selling seems safer if they use real cash, counted, and held.
Anonymity could be desired, buy the only precaution might be "give me your car keys" or "let me hold your ID". Don't want to offend other party or be paranoid, but for any large amount I want some precaution.

Cars, diamonds, baseball cards, bitcoin... any durable good may change in value relative to other goods - e.g. whether there is surge in baseball popularity, or increase in car making, or any other change.
In the case of fiat(the money, not the car)... its supply increases relative to bitcoin.
Greshams Law talked about minted coins of varying quality with fixed face value... and compared apples to apples, not apples to oranges or bitcoin.

I think anonymizing options are improving...
TumbleBit? - a decentralized tumbler
MimbleWimble? - a sidechain with native privacy
Schnorr signatures - possible to do coinjoin
Until these things are available, you got tumblers like bitmixer.io or better option IMHO is Monero. 
The monero route is more involved, but not difficult (use tor --&gt; shapeshift or changelly --&gt; monero cli (remote node gives convenience vs control) --&gt; xmr.to)

a lot of people (including myself) have falsely stated that bitcoin's value correlates with # of transactions.
actually, the value correlates with hoarding(hodling).
that's basic economics of demand-supply.
think of every xmas when hot toys come out (fidget spinners, cabbage patch dolls) and they fly off shelves then sell on ebay for $500. the value isn't because they are traded, it's because they are scarce.
bitcoin has amazing possibilities to be adopted as currency, but it's primarily a store of value (and those layers may come with time).
beind widely adopted as currency would make it's demand skyrocket, but so will people hoarding it... anticipating that future.

Bitcoin IS code.
You cannot oust core developers.
The market will follow the best platform and best developers.
Even if Jihan or BlockStream wrangled control of Bitcoin... innovation would move to a better chain which would slowly take control back (miners would switch), by its attractiveness of features.
Proof of Work change is absolutely on the table as a strategy for keeping Bitcoin control dispersed. There are a dozen ways to sensibly do it: phase it in, algorithmically balance it like difficulty changes, etc.

This is a really important problem... one I'm facing on a website I'm building.
Once you establish identity, you could build and share trust &amp; reputation across sites.
We need standards here, but I think existing technologies could help... e.g. if more sites support oauth.
Imagine you have txn history on localbitcoin, ebay, bitrated, etc.
If other sites could "link" those accounts, you could prove trust for that identity across sites.
I don't see why its in eBays or localbitcoin interest to support oauth however.
Onename gets around oauth in a unique way... They require you to verify your account by posting something to your public profile as proof.
I think a service like onename (or someone who does it better, faster) could build the next backbone of trust for bitcoin markets... where you don't have credit card fraud protection. A service could link trusted reputations across separate markets, by proving identity where the site doesn't natively support it.

Hypothetical question... Is Lighthouse truly uncensored, and *anything* could be funded there?
Take for example ISIS... and its public enraging habit of beheading innocents. Could a crowdfunded effort be created to hire mercenaries which would perform some sort of strategic military objective?

Sounds like that's describing fraud, not derivative investments. People will stop believing "paper backed by X" is better than toilet paper, the day it's price significantly deviates from the real asset.
In order to keep the instrument alive, it's going to need to peg the real asset somehow. The only reason GBTC gets away with such premium is it's the only game in town. It's still pegging the assets.

Yeah looks true, looks like they don't peg shares to coin perfectly (thus the big premium, like you said)... 
From Grayscales site: "There can be no assurance that the value of the shares will approximate the value of the Bitcoin held by the Trust and the shares may trade at a substantial premium over or discount to the value of the Trust's Bitcoin."

banning bitcoin would be controversial and could be viewed as draconian...backfire on politicians.
So, they do what they are ALREADY doing... which is regulate it to death.
Wanna buy coffee with bitcoin? Fine, just fill out this IRS form for every transaction.
Want to exchange bitcoin for dollars? No problem, just apply for a license and we'll get back to you.
This is the best thing they can do to prevent usage increasing.
If usage ticks up, they will squeeze big players... merchants who consider accepting bitcoin, etc. If they need to, they squeeze more folks harder, make more cumbersome rules.

2nd layer (e.g. LN) can move transactions off chain, but in Bitcoin Maximalist Utopia... fees would obviously skyrocket due to tremendous usage, unless block size increased.
I think in world of skyrocketing fees, there would be consensus to eventually hard-fork an increase block size for legitimate reasons with universal consensus (unlike premature forking like BCash).
That is unless LN evolves so majority of population lives entirely off-chain, and only New Money Lightning Banks do on-chain transactions for us, in very large amounts for settlement... while our salaries and bills are paid with LN satoshis.

i realized its a mixed bag...
transaction fees determined by demand (# of transactions)
mining centralization determined by barriers to entry
mining incentive combination of block rewards + fees
So if block reward decreases, and all other factors remain same ... I suppose all these happen: 1) unprofitable miners disappear, 2) difficulty adjusts, 3) fees remain same.
So - following that logic... block reward decrease does potentially centralize mining, right? (assuming that fewer miners = more centralized)
This is separate from the fact that txn volume WILL certainly increase... possibly negating that effect.

Losing money is exactly the same as losing buried stash of gold, cash, etc...
Someone will not have filed a report, if they don't know they lost it until asked to look for it.
My father legitimately lost over 1 BTC a couple years ago (not backing up his wallet). He didn't call the police or file a loss. Hardly a crime. He couldn't prove it either. Lost Monero wallet? Same diff.
It will be something else if we enter a world where we are being prosecuted without due process or probable cause. I realize the system already ignores those limits, but it is very difficult for IRS to witch hunt someone sitting on a buried stash of gold/cash/monero, without having spent it on tangible items (lambos, what have you).
I hear what you're saying... That you will have to explain yourself, if you demonstrate inexplicable wealth. The crypto world is no different than otherwise however. Having buried gold is not a crime. Losing it is not a crime. Unreported income will be a problem for those are are caught, obviously.
I encourage cutting traces with Monero (my post above), not because massive tax evasion will be a successful, but because privacy is not (yet) possible with Bitcoin... So cutting trails from Coinbase is good practice ASAP (don't wait for price to rise), to give you equivalent privacy as gold/cash.
That said, *taxation is theft*.
You may or may not give it all up: your wallet + buried stash + jewels when a burglar comes. Or you may leverage decoys as theft insurance. That will be a different choice for everyone, based on circumstances.
All hypothetical -
I am hodler who would never sell my precious (anytime soon), so none of this applies to me :-)

SegWit advances bitcoin.
You forgot to ask about ASICBoost, and it's relation to SegWit. ASICBoost is hardware designed to exploit a "bug" in bitcoin, patented by Jihan Wu of Bitmain. SegWit fixes that bug, which is why Jihan Wu's cohort is blocking advancement of bitcoin.

I dont see Segwit2x as a conspiracy, rather a compromise... which UASF deserves credit for forcing.
Miners dont control. Users dont control. They both have stake.
If miners play some shenanigans, back out of SegWit and attack BIP 148... then they are fucked!
Next version of UASF will be turned out 2 months with POW change... and more support than ever!
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:07:52
nothing at stake?
many users (myself included) have significant portion of our net worth sitting in bitcoin, because the platform itself is potentially revolutionary.
i'm not going to sit by idly and watch this promise be strangled by monopolizing miners.
I have no problem with a chain fork. I know which chains I will hold vs sell, the innovative one.
If bitcoin is at whim of miners w/o any user influence, then bitcoin is already failed.

Yeah, seemed like common conclusion was that halving was "priced in" months ahead... 
Go balls deep at least 6 months prior to halving
The irony may be market efficiency, that once a pattern is a known... It is predicted, so disappears.
