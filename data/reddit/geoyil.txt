Ok I just want to buy it for personal use, so I can store them so i thought it would be easy to use credit card.

I know but the SEPA process seemed to be non-simple. You had to send "a small amount" why aren't they more specific, what happens with that small amount?

What does this mean? does it affect how i import/sweep? Is there anything I need to consider? Thanks for the help

Do you mean that the cost of sweeping will be increased if there are multiple transactions to the paper wallet? 
So for example its more expansive to sweep a wallet that received 1 btc and then later 1 btc, a total of 2 btc.
Rather then receiving one transaction with 2 btc?

Yes I read that part in his answer but I didn't understand to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:30:22
how small can it be? can it be less than a dollar or is there a limit?

Is there a guide (a more detailed one) for the electrum where you use it offline and then push the transactions from another device.

I have not read alot about Trezor but can you sweep a paper wallet to trezor directly? 
BTW: Trezor runs in chrome extensions right? I thought you said do not use a wallet which runs in a web browser

I think he said it because he meant that it is unsafe to not do it. He says
*"You might ask why go through the trouble to do all this. That is because sometimes if you import a private key it might be reused by the wallet app/web service and change is sent back to it. You want to avoid that because if you assume you've spent all the coins in the private key and then you make the private key public and change is sent to it somebody could steal your coins. So to avoid all that you import into a temporary blockchain.info wallet and spend all the coins in one go."*

ok, unfortunately credit cards dosen't seem to work with that site if you are in sweden, but thanks

ok but since it is a paper wallet when you sweep. dosent the entire balance being transferred? I mean you arent sweeping twice are you?
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:36:34
Ok so basically sweep paper wallet. Pay or do whatever you do and send the change to a new paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:23:46
I will not do that. I will use a paper wallet. I just figured that once I sweep it I should be able to mulitple make partial transactions from my wallet in blockchain rather then just sending all of the bitcoins in the blockchain wallet at once
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:04:15
Dosent seem to work with credit card..
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:10:18
Thanks a lot I think I understand now :)

This does not solve the problem of moving the coins from paper wallet to another since I need to sweep the entire balance and that will be stored on a wallet that is connected.
