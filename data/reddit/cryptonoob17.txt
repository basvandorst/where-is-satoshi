That's not how it works. When you buy Bitcoin on Coinbase app you don't get "whatever the price is in about a week". It shows you the current BTC price and the amount of BTC you will get.
But, you have to wait 7-10 days for the banks to fully clear your money before you can transfer the BTC out

Cash app is great as an fiat on ramp. The fees are less than Coinbase app. Cash app fees are built in to the price (higher compared to Coinbase when buying and lower when selling). On a $1000 purchase you get about $14 more Bitcoin for your money with Cash App than Coinbase.
For times when you want to instant buy, cash app is cheaper than Coinbase app but if you have time (7-10 days) to send fiat to Coinbase pro, I think a 0.25% limit buy order will be cheaper.
I don't use cash app to trade (buy &amp; sell), but you could. I don't like the spread. They recently enabled BTC deposits so you can move BTC to the cash app and sell.
Cash app is great as an on ramp. Buy BTC and move it to your wallet (or exchange) instantly (no 10 day wait period like Coinbase). As a trading platform it's about the same as using Coinbase app to buy / sell Bitcoin for trading which you shouldn't do unless you like paying fees.

By guessing. You enter the Limit price in US Dollars at which you want to buy, then at Amount you enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy for that price. This is where the guessing starts.
 Enter something like 0.02 and check the total USD value you are buying at the bottom where it shows TOTAL and FEE.
Keep adjusting that 0.02 up/down until you get it closer to $200
The other way would be to calculate how much BTC you Need. If BTC price is $10,075 and you need $200
200 / 10,075 = 0.01985111
The fees are not fixed amounts. They are percentages of the trade.
Limit orders = 0.15%
Market orders = 0.25%

Having a good password can't protect you against a key logger. It logs every letter you type. So if you type your password, even a 128 character long random alphanumeric password, it would know your password. 
Having a good password is only one step of security. You need to make it as difficult as possible by adding more levels of security, like 2 factor authentication. Don't use texts as your 2fa. Simcards can get cloned easily

Leston Lawrence and his lawyers used this to his advantage. In a decision by the Ontario Court of Appeals, three judges ruled that Lawrence’s fine should be reduced by nearly $60,000 because the gold he stole from the Royal Canadian Mint was not as valuable when he stole and sold it as it was when he was ordered to pay it back.
In 2017, Lawrence was convicted of smuggling small gold pucks out of the mint where he worked by, as the Crown said, concealing them in his rectum and walking right out the front door. At sentencing, Lawrence was ordered to pay back roughly the value of the gold, which at the time of sentencing was about $190,000. If he couldn’t pay that money back in three years, he would have to serve a two-and-a-half-year stint in prison.
Last month, Lawrence’s lawyers went to the court of appeal to have that number reduced. Their argument was that the judge wrongly used the then-current market value of the gold to determine the fine instead of the amount that Lawrence had actually stolen. The $190,000 figure, they argued, was more money than it would have actually cost the mint to replace it. Not only was the gold only worth about $165,000 at the time Lawrence stole it, but he was only able to sell the gold for about $130,000. Ergo, argued his lawyer, it was an unfair fine.
The judges agreed — sort of. Justices Mary Lou Benotto, Gary Trotter and David Paciocco ruled that, “In our view, the sentencing judge erred by using the market value of the gold as the amount of the fine.” The purpose of the fine was only to pay back the “proceeds of crime,” and since the Canadian Mint buys gold in bulk, argued Lawrence’s lawyers, the amount of the fine should reflect that. In the end, the judges ruled that the amount Lawrence was able to get on the street for his gold — $130,206.19 — would be the same amount he would be required to pay back to avoid jail time.
Lawrence has yet to begin paying back his fine, nearly a year-and-a-half later. According to the decision, this is because “he has yet to sell his house because he prefers to wait for it to increase in value.”

Be careful when entering your private keys into a new fork wallet. It's good practice to 1st empty out the coins linked to the private key before entering it.
I've never heard of this fork. There have been a couple of bitcoin privacy forks recently. In September bitcoin anonymous is forking. It is basically a pump &amp; dump scam of that bald shithead Jake crypto "king". It's just another copy of the Bitcoin Private (BTCP) fork with added staking or master nodes or something.
Bitcoin private forked in February 2018. It's one of the better btc forks out there. Forked from btc and zClassic, it combines btc with zk-snarks which have been proven to be more anonymous than other privacy protocols like ring signatures and obfuscation used by coins like Monero (which is Traceable with 80% accuracy, proven by MIT).
 No fork is without controversy. Btcp started out as just another zero coin pump &amp; dump of the serial forker, Rhett Creighton (he also forked zClassic from Zcash). He started working on his next fork and didn't contribute to btcp development so he was kicked off the dev team. So he childishly removed them from the btcp sub on reddit.
No matter the bad publicity and image btcp has, it has a very dedicated team &amp; community. They have so far delivered on all the goals they set up. They finished a rebase of the btc code, which makes btcp fully compatible with segwit, lightning Network and all btc can do.
I don't have any BTCP, but have been following it since the beginning. February was a really bad time to launch any coin or fork

Their 1st mistake was to quit their jobs &amp; stay home to 'watch' their miners working while playing computer games. So they were using mined btc to pay rent, food, gas and mining expenses. Would have been better to still pay personal expenses with fiat salary so you can hold more of the Bitcoin. Guess their hashing ROI calculations were a bit off.
I almost went into btc mining last year but decided against it because of the ever increasing mining difficulty. Buying and holding btc was a beter move.

A lot of stuff. With LN it's fast &amp; cheap. Has great adoption. Good store of value. It's not trying to be something else, it's bitcoin and it doesn't try to scam people into buying it.
It's decentralized, unlike bch. It's scalable with LN, one day it will surpass Visa. BCH will never scale to that level with just big blocks and old technology. Satoshi was a genius, but trying to stick to his vision alone is trying to build a blockchain with one hand tied behind your back. Coins with new technology, especially stuff that Satoshi couldn't yet come up with because technology or ideas didn't exist yet, will always be superior.
We didn't just take Newton's laws of gravity and said, right, that's enough. We are going to continue with newton's vision. No, we continued to build new ideas on top of it, and today we have the theory of relativity, theoretical astro physics, etc.

Get a hardware wallet (trezor $?? or a ledger for $60). Backup the 24 seed words. Those are like your internet banking login details. keep it very safe. beware of writing or printing it on paper. paper can burn or fade over time. The safest is to engrave it onto metal. If your hardware wallet goes missing or breaks you can still access your bitcoin using a new hardware wallet (or compatible software wallet) with your original 24 seed words.
If you don't want to spend $60 on a hardware wallet, then go the software route. download Electrum bitcoin wallet (ONLY from electrum.org). set it up and about the 24 seed words, follow Gandalf's advice : **Keep it safe, Keep it secret.**
beware of paper wallets. they are a hassle to set up if you want to do it right. It has to be on an offline Linux computer with an old style printer (unless you know how to disable all the caching and print spooling on new printers). If you do a paper wallet wrong, you can lose your bitcoin. don't do what a lot of noobs are doing and enter your seed words or private key on some "paperwalletgenerator" website. A lot of those are scam websites that will steal all your bitcoin. If you are gonna use a paper wallet, read up on the limitations. You can't spend Bitcoin from a paper wallet, unless you spend every last bit of it in one transaction. In Bitcoin transactions there is outputs. The easy way to explain this is spending from a paper wallet is like using a $20 bill to pay for something that costs $5 at a store that don't give any change. You will lose $15. You don't have that problem when spending Bitcoin from a software/hardware wallet, because the wallet takes care of the outputs. You still pay with a $20 bill, but your change ($15) is sent to a new wallet address that is created using your private key. All of this is done automatically. So to spend $5 from a paper wallet that has $20 in it, you would have to import the paper wallet into a Software/Hardware wallet, so it can take care of the outputs of the transaction. My knowledge on paper wallets are limited, I've never set one up or used them. I could be wrong on some of the points about transaction outputs.
DO NOT: print your paper wallet at the office or an internet cafe. Networked printers keep a copy of all printed documents on a server. Do not print it on your home printer unless you took the necessary precautions. Home printers cache printed documents, and the print spooler in Windows also keeps a copy of the document (if it is set up that way). If you take your computer or printer to be repaired or if anyone gets physical access to your computer they can find a copy of your paper wallet if they know where to look.
Being your own bank comes with a lot of responsibility. With Bitcoin, there's no customer service to run to because you lost your login credentials or sent Bitcoin to the wrong wallet address. This means you have to double check everything you do, and always assume someone or some software is trying to scam you. A lot of people get scammed or physhed and ends up losing cryptocurrency. In most of these cases it could have been avoided if the person didn't trust so easily. In Bitcoin there's a saying: **"Don't trust, Verify"**, which brings me to the next section.
When you download a wallet file, you have to make sure that it is indeed the real wallet and not a fake wallet that scammers wants you to download. They want you to think that you are using the real wallet. It even looks exactly like the real one. But when you enter your seed or private keys into this wallet, your info gets sent to them. They then enter your seed into the real wallet and empty out the bitcoin you had in there. This is why you have to verify you have the real wallet file downloaded.
* Make sure you are on the original wallet website. For Electrum this is electrum.org (I'm not going to link you to it). Read the URL. watch out for small "mistakes" in the spelling. This can include stuff like substituting 0 (zero) with O (letter o) or L and 1 (one), or in the case of Electrum, something like "Electrun". Smaller tricks they do but harder to spot is using unicode characters that has a little dot or accent on it like this "Eleċtrum" (notice the small dot on c)
* watch out for overly friendly people on the internet trying to help you click on a link. Even if the link says [Eletrum]( Like this link I just gave you, it goes to Microsoft website, but a scammer could make it go to his fake 'electrun' website.
* Check the site certificate. It's a small green Lock icon next to the URL. Websites have certificates which are verified by companies like Gandi, DigiCert inc, VeriSign Inc...and more. This proves that you are on the right website and did not get redirected to the physhing (fake) site. Look for the company name or URL of the wallet in the certificate.
* Verify the digital signature of the file with GnuPG (you can download opensource software for this, Kleopatra). Before the wallet file gets uploaded to the Downloads page, the file is signed by the developer. You have to also get their public GnuPG key to test if the file you have is the same file that they uploaded. Scammers can't download the original file, change it and upload it again. The digital signature won't match.
* Other ways to verify downloaded files is by getting the MD5/SHA1/SHA256 checksum from the download page. Download a MD5/SHA file checksum checker (software) and test the downloaded file. This is not the safest option, because if you are on a fake website the scammer will make sure that his fake wallet file will also match the checksum he provides on his fake download page. Scammers can't download the original file, change it with their extra lines of programming and upload it again because the checksum won't match with the checksum provided on the legitimate download website.
Always double check the wallet address when sending cryptocurrency. I don't check the whole 64 character long string, but only the 1^st and last 5. This is because of malware called "Clippers" (like a computer virus) that monitors your clipboard for when you Copy a crypto wallet address to paste it into a wallet to send funds. This Clipper then intercepts the recipient wallet address and changes it to the scammer's own wallet address. This way, you click "paste" to send crypto but instead you pasted the scammer's wallet address and he gets the funds.

Months ago it was said that Bitcoin won't fall below $6000 because that's the cost the miners are paying to mine one BTC. Well here we are and the price dropped almost 50% since $6000. That argument is Bullshit. Tell your friend to look at the [hashing power graphs]( It has been going up since January.
He is right, some miners will quit mining if it is not profitable. The other miners with cheaper electricity will keep running. The difficulty will be lowered, and the miners who previously quit will jump back in because it is again profitable. 
He must also not know how the difficulty adjustments work. Less miners does not guarantee a 51% attack. After the difficulty changes the network can be just as safe with 70 miners as 100 miners on higher difficulty.
Miners not getting a block reward isn't something we have to worry about in our lifetimes. That will happen in 2140. Then miners will be paid in transaction fees, which doesn't sound like much now but by that time there won't be any fiat money left. So getting Satoshis for transactions will be like getting gold.

I almost asked that question but then thought about it. Bitcoin needs the miners to find and hash blocks of transactions. They need the internet for that. That would be for on-chain transactions. LN transactions I think would still need the internet, even though you don't need the miners because the channel is still open you would need servers hooked up to the internet (I think), Lightning Labs? maybe only LN nodes?
Maybe someone can correct me, but I think the whole internet being down across the world would break Bitcoin.

It comes from the unmined part of the Bitcoin 21 Million supply. (21 million total - around 17 million already mined = 4 million unmined BTC)
The transaction fees comes from Bitcoin already in circulation. Fees paid by the people who sent the BTC transactions.
In the year 2140, the last of the unmined Bitcoin will be paid out to the miners. Then the miners get transaction fees only. Doesn't sound like much at the moment, but by then a couple of satoshis will be much more than it is now.

No. You can have it all in one address, or you can have it in 10 smaller addresses. But 1 wallet address will make it easier to claim the forked coin.


You can keep your wallet addresses the same. To be safe, don't move any coins until at least 1 block confirmation after the snapshot.
**DON'T ENTER YOUR PRE-FORK WALLET ADDRESS INTO THE NEW FORKED WALLET TO CLAIM COINS** before you empty out your Bitcoin. If you still have Bitcoin in your pre-fork wallet and a scamming wallet gets your private keys, YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR BITCOIN in that wallet. FIRST move the bitcoin to a new wallet. If you used a scam wallet, then only your NEW forked coins is at risk of getting stolen, and not all your bitcoin that you used to claim the new fork.
**Always check the SHA-1 / MD5 Checksum or the GnuPG / PGP signature of the wallet file you are downloading**

I know. Validating a file's checksum isn't safe if you are on a fake website. Which is why you should use as many security measures as possible. Check you are on the right site and also check that the file is digitally signed by the developers of the wallet.
A lot of this stuff can get too much for the average non-technical person, which is why there are so many scams.
An even bigger problem is if the actual legit site gets hacked and a "new" wallet file and corresponding checksum gets uploaded to the site. That's where the hackers wouldn't be able to digitally sign the new scam wallet and you would know something is wrong when you check the PGP signature.
Something similar happened in 2017 to a bitcoin fork, think it was Bitcoin Gold, where hackers changed a wallet address on the official site or wallet and a lot of people lost money, even though they thought they were using the official wallet/site.

sending a transaction with almost 0 fee, like 1 sat/byte won't do anything.

Get a hardware wallet (ledger or trezor) or a software wallet (Electrum.org). You can set those up anonymously. When downloading a Bitcoin wallet, make sure you are on the official wallet website. Look for spelling "mistakes" in the url and check the site certificate. Download a MD5 or SHA1 checksum file checker to test the downloaded file with the Hash provided on the download page. You can also download Kleopatra, it's software for verifying the GNUPGP digital signature of the file.
These are all extra security measures everybody should use to avoid being scammed or physhed. 
You won't be able to set up a Coinbase account without letting them know who you are, because they ask for ID before you can buy crypto.
You can use Bitcoin atms or localbitcoins to buy Bitcoin. I'm not sure if localbitcoins is anonymous anymore, I think they started doing KYC a while back.
Remember, if you have a Coinbase account linked to your name, or bank account and send those bitcoins to your anonymous hardware or software wallet, you will lose anonymity. Because the Bitcoin blockchain is public, anyone can track your Bitcoin. They 'link' your anonymous Bitcoin wallet to your 'known' Coinbase (or exchange) wallet. 
You have to send it to an exchange that don't verify your identity, then buy Monero, send the Monero to another Monero wallet (like a different exchange) then sell it for Bitcoin, and send it to your anonymous hardware / software wallet.
There are Bitcoin wallets that you can use, like Wasabi, that uses Coin join. It mixes your Bitcoin with other people's Bitcoin (before giving it back to you) so it is harder to trace.
There's services available called Bitcoin mixers (think they are also called tumblers) that will mix your Bitcoin with other Bitcoin before giving you your Bitcoin back. Be careful and do research about this. There's a lot of scam sites that will steal your Bitcoin.

4^th Common bitcoin mistake : taking advice from just about anybody with a blog


Don't print your paper wallet or sensitive crypto info on a printer/computer you don't control. Printers and computers can save a digital copy of every page it prints. Either on the printer self, or in the Windows Print Spooler. There are ways you can turn this off and print directly to printer without saving a copy.
If your computer or printer breaks and you get it repaired, a dishonest printer technician can copy your saved prints and go through it on his own time and look for crypto stuff.

Fiat currency has its origins in the Roman times where they would "cut" the silver coins with other metals.

Yeah it's not totally gone. There's a way to get it back if you sent bch to a BTC address, or there used to be. But remember, we are talking about people here that don't know the difference between BTC and bcash. They aren't going to do all the technical stuff to get bch back that was sent to the BTC chain by mistake.
Don't know if this is still possible with all the new upgrades they had to do to protect against 51% attack because of their unsecured network. Which ironically puts their centralized scam coin further from Satoshi's Original Vision.
@_date: 2019-08-23 22:55:28
Yes, that's correct. You use the BTC private key to make a bch wallet and send it back.
The problem is that people who get duped into buying bcash also don't have a clue what a private key is.

I used to think that too, until one day I figured out why it worked (sometimes). If there's a lot of people doing TA and drawing lines on charts, and according to that a price of 7600 is support, then they are going to put buy orders in between 7600-7650. So, when the price actually goes there, it finds support, because there's a lot of TA buy orders in that zone. Some call it a self fulfilling prophecy. TA sometimes works because if enough people are doing (the same) thing, it makes the market react according to these TA rules

That's called the spread. It's how they hide the fees.
Technically you are buying at a more expensive Bitcoin price, but if you add the fees Coinbase charges you end up paying more on Coinbase.
I did the test with $100 and also $1000. When buying $1000 Bitcoin on cash app you get $14 more Bitcoin than Coinbase

This is called a "**Bait &amp; Switch**" Scam. It has nothing to do with the bcash "product", which just happens to be really bad. If bch was any good, then people would use it. People would rather use Doge coin which says a lot.^(no offense to Doge holders, I've held some before)
If you click on "buy Bitcoin" and instantly get redirected to a buy bcash page, you're getting scammed.

If Robin hood is going to exchange all their customer's "paper Bitcoin", they are going to have to buy real Bitcoin (verifiable on the Blockchain) to put into these new wallets.

If Bitcoin goes up 100 in price, your 100 investment does not double. If you want your investment to double, the Bitcoin price also has to double.
It is all relative to the Bitcoin price. You are missing the most important part of the equation, the price.
If the Bitcoin price goes up 100 (from 10,000 to 10,100) it increased by 1% in USD value. This means your 100 investment also increased by 1% in USD terms, to 101
It's like any other investment. If you invest chump change you are not going to make thousands. (unless you bought 100 usd of Bitcoin in 2010)

I'm not gonna spend all day researching, but so far the 2018 presidential elections were a sham. It was rigged and Maduro was going to win no matter what, or better in the words of Venezuelans "Maduro would beat Jesus".
Some points why I think it was rigged:  
1 - Only Venezuelans living overseas and in Caracas can participate in the presidential [elections.](
This would be the same as Trump excluding the Californian snowflakes from voting in the next US presidential election.
2 - Maduro had 2 of his opponents banned or arrested.
3 - Voter intimidation from Maduro

Some quick tips :
1) don't trust anybody. always assume they are trying to get your Bitcoin. Be cautious of "friendly strangers" on the internet. (even me).
2) If you are in the States, use Square Cash App to buy Bitcoin. You can withdraw your coins instantly whereas Coinbase makes you wait 7-10 days. Coinbase also has higher fees. Cash app doesn't show any fees, but their fees are hidden in the form of a higher spot buy price. Coinbase has a minimum fee of $1, so if you use them to buy $5 of Bitcoin, you are wasting money on fees. Effectively losing 20% of every $5 on fees. Rather use cash app with no minimum fee. If a recurring monthly buy is your reason for using Coinbase, then just use cash app and set a monthly reminder on your phone to "buy BTC". It literally takes me 30 seconds to open up cash app and buy BTC. If the cash app verification (to withdraw btc to own wallet) fails, try again, that's what I did and it worked. I did a test and bought $1000 of BTC from both and I got $14 more Bitcoin using cash app compared to Coinbase with its fees. 
3) Don't become an Alt coin maximalist. You'll hear them say crap like, "Bitcoin is old outdated technology" which is somewhat true. The internal combustion engine is also very old technology from the 1800's, yet it's still the dominant form of transport today. If you want the most secure network on earth, use BTC. If you want instant transactions, use LN. For other reasons, use an Alt coin. Not saying you shouldn't buy some Alt coins, but be careful, some are scams (exit, pump &amp; dump or imitation scams like bcash). There's only one cryptocurrency that's been here from the start, alts on the other hand come and go. Some don't even last a year. Same goes for ICO's / IEO's or whatever 3 letter shit they come up with next to get people's money.
4) Don't use an exchange to store your coins (except when busy trading) , keep it in your own wallet. Exchanges are often hacked because they are huge targets. Sometimes the owners of the exchange exit scam (run away with everybody's coins like Quadriga CX) or they go bankrupt (Mt Gox or more recently Cryptopia after they got hacked)
5) learn about the different ways people get their Bitcoin stolen, like Physhing (through fake wallets or fake websites that look just like the real one) Don't assume you are on the correct website, always make sure by checking site certificates. Make sure your computer security is up to date (anti-virus, adware/Spyware, screen recorders &amp; keyboard loggers). 
6) Being your own bank comes with a lot of responsibility. With Bitcoin, there's no customer service to run to because you lost your login credentials or sent Bitcoin to the wrong wallet address. This means you have to double check everything you do, and always assume someone or some software is trying to scam you. A lot of people get scammed or physhed and ends up losing cryptocurrency. In most of these cases it could have been avoided if the person didn't trust so easily. In Bitcoin there's a saying: **"Don't trust, Verify"**, which brings me to the next section.
7) WALLET &amp; WEBSITE SAFETY : When you download a wallet file, you have to make sure that it is indeed the real wallet and not a fake wallet that scammers wants you to download. They want you to think that you are using the real wallet. It even looks exactly like the real one. But when you enter your seed or private keys into this wallet, your info gets sent to them. They then enter your seed into the real wallet and empty out the bitcoin you had in there. This is why you have to verify you have the real wallet file downloaded.
* Make sure you are on the original wallet website. For Electrum this is electrum.org (I'm not going to link you to it). Read the URL. watch out for small "mistakes" in the spelling. This can include stuff like substituting 0 (zero) with O (letter o) or L and 1 (one), or in the case of Electrum, something like "Electrun". Smaller tricks they do but harder to spot is using unicode characters that has a little dot or accent on it like this "Eleċtrum" (notice the small dot on c)
* watch out for overly friendly people on the internet trying to help you click on a link. Even if the link says [Eletrum]( Like this link I just gave you, it goes to Microsoft website, but a scammer could make it go to his fake 'electrun' website.
* Check the site certificate. It's a small green Lock icon next to the URL. Websites have certificates which are verified by companies like Gandi, DigiCert inc, VeriSign Inc...and more. This proves that you are on the right website and did not get redirected to the physhing (fake) site. Look for the company name or URL of the wallet in the certificate.
* Verify the digital signature of the file with GnuPG (you can download opensource software for this, Kleopatra). Before the wallet file gets uploaded to the Downloads page, the file is signed by the developer. You have to also get their public GnuPG key to test if the file you have is the same file that they uploaded. Scammers can't download the original file, change it and upload it again. The digital signature won't match.
* Other ways to verify downloaded files is by getting the MD5/SHA1/SHA256 checksum from the download page. Download a MD5/SHA file checksum checker (software) and test the downloaded file. This is not the safest option, because if you are on a fake website the scammer will make sure that his fake wallet file will also match the checksum he provides on his fake download page. Scammers can't download the original file, change it with their extra lines of programming and upload it again because the checksum won't match with the checksum provided on the legitimate download website.
Always double check the wallet address when sending cryptocurrency. I don't check the whole 64 character long string, but only the 1^st and last 5, This is because of malware called "Clippers" (like a computer virus) that monitors your clipboard for when you Copy a crypto wallet address to paste it into a wallet to send funds. This Clipper then intercepts the recipient wallet address and changes it to the scammer's own wallet address. This way, you click "paste" to send crypto but instead you pasted the scammer's wallet address and he gets the funds.

Yes. To transfer Bitcoin from/to an exchange to your personal wallet (hardware, desktop or mobile) costs money. This transaction fee is to pay the miners who has to include your transaction into the next block they mine. This fee changes all the time according to how busy the network is (number of transactions). The transaction fee is calculated as : Satoshis per byte (Sat/byte). The miners usually choose the higher Sat/Byte transactions to include in the next block, because they get paid more that way. If your transaction fee is too low, or lower than what most people are willing to pay to get their Bitcoin sent, your transaction could sit in the Mempool for hours or days before the fees go low enough for the miners to be "interested" in adding your transaction to a block. You can view the mempool [here]( The mempool clears almost everyday unless there's something happening to the price and more people are doing transactions. The wallet usually deals with the transaction fees estimate.
Once your transaction gets added to a block it should have 1 confirmation after about 10 minutes when that same block gets completed and added to the long chain of blocks in the Bitcoin Blockchain. The transaction is irreversible by this point. about 10 minutes later it is basically permanently part of the blockchain with 2 confirmations.


Electrum BTC Wallet - you can download it free from   
It's a desktop wallet. If you have to update it, always go to the official website to download the updated install file. a couple of months ago some people got physhed using electrum wallet. They clicked on an "update window" telling them electrum needs to be updated and got redirected to a fake download page and lost some bitcoin. That's why I say go to Electrum.org to download the original. Practice the safety tips I gave above when downloading wallets to make sure you don't get scammed and you should be fine.
Less safe options for storing Bitcoin is mobile wallets. People usually use these as a hot wallet and only keep some Bitcoin in them to spend.  
some mobile wallets: Bread wallet, samourai,

you don't have to sign up, if you have a coinbase account, you have coinbase pro. just log into pro.coinbase.com.


If you are verified KYC on coinbase, you are also verified on Coinbase Pro. You don't have to do ID checks again


Coinbase pro doesn't have an app, it's a website only (like most exchanges)


I think the same accounts and cards that are linked to your basic Coinbase account is also linked to your Coinnase Pro acc.
*Make sure of the spelling in the URL, double check for small dots or accents on letters. Phishing scam websites use these methods to trick people into believing they are on a legitimate site. Check the small green Lock icon (site certificate) next to the url (firefox), it should say "Coinbase Inc (US)". Maybe log into Coinbase website and follow a link to get to Coinbase Pro. Never click on links to coinbase pro in an email, or from people on the internet. That's why I didn't give you the exact link*

Wow, this dude. Just jumping from one shit show to the next. Read up on him and see how many times he has run a company into bankruptcy.
In the 90s he was part of a start up company, Digital Entertainment network which raised $88 million in venture capital. 3 years later the company collapsed.
In 2001, Pierce founded Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE), a company which pioneered the MMORPG currency-selling services industry.
In 2005, Pierce estimated that IGE accounted for about 50% of this online market in the U.S., which has about $500 million in annual volume.  The next year, facing a class-action lawsuit, the company failed, had no assets and Pierce was forced out.
Then he got involved with block.one and EOS, a $4 billion shit show. Then he got fired from that because of his, uh, [Shenanigans]( with underage kids (allegedly).
Then he got to work on his crypto island idea in Puerto Rico.


And now he wants to bring Mt gox back to life. I won't use it, no way.

You are right. Coinbase pro won't let you set a limit sell of 7000 when the price is 7500. But it does have limit stop orders.
He would have to set a limit sell order trigger price at 7000 for a limit sell price of 7000.01 but if the market moves too fast down through 7000 into 6900's, his sell price of 7000.01 won't execute.
The better option here would have been to use a stop market order, but Coinbase did away with those when they added the maker fees in March 2019.

There's enough Bitcoin. We don't need the "lost" Bitcoin to come back. With 100 million Satoshis in 1 BTC, there's enough ways to divide a coin. When it is needed, a few more decimals can be added with a BIP upgrade
@_date: 2019-02-05 06:25:33
All the alts are priced in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes up the alts also go up.
The Bitcoin price went up within about 6 months after each halving. That's because the block reward gets cut in half, which means the miners can only sell half of the amount of Bitcoin they usually do. This changes the rate of which the Bitcoin supply is growing. Less "sell" orders in the market.

That's understandable. Be careful day trading. Cryptocurrency is very volatile. It's fine if you do it on small scale at least until you think you are confident to try larger amounts. I only trade with a small % of my total bitcoin. Most of it I hold for long term. It's safer that way.


That is exactly what I was referring to. Good to see you are keeping up with cryptocurrency news


[SegWit]( is a Bitcoin scaling software upgrade. It removes the Witness part of a Bitcoin transaction and stores it off-chain. This increases the number of Bitcoin transactions the miners can fit into a block. Through SegWit, batching and other scaling upgrades Bitcoin can now fit more than twice the amount of transactions in 1 block.
It's a different way of scaling Bitcoin to handle more transactions without just increasing the block size, something Bcash (BCH) did after they forked (copied) from Bitcoin in Aug 2017. That simplistic approach to scaling, the lies and anti Bitcoin propaganda led to the failure of that coin (nobody is using it. Doge coin which started as just a meme or joke has more daily transactions) and ended the "big vs small block" scaling debate.
So Blockchain.info, and it's investors, like the scammer roger vermin has little to gain by using segwit. It would make transaction fees for the users of Blockchain.info cheaper. It would allow more transactions per Bitcoin block, something they don't want because Ver has been saying for years that Bitcoin can't scale and increasing block size is the only way to go.

I do the same. Not only do I save on a $60 bank wire fee, because BTC transaction is ~$0.10, there's also a 5% difference (premium) in the Bitcoin price in my home country. This means I get $70 more per $1,000 of BTC when selling in my country. Add the $60 wire fee and I get $130 more money per $1,000 sent. That's 13% saved.


Because I also have BTC in my home country I can buy and sell instantly and don't have to worry about timing it right with price drops affecting the amount I get out.

Moving your coin off the ledger to Electrum and back will cost ~$0.10, and you can test the seed and move coin back within hour(s). I still think that is going to be faster, cheaper and less hassle than getting a 2^nd hardware wallet for $60 and waiting 2-5 days for shipping.
As for having another hardware wallet as backup, I don't see the point. If mine gets lost / stolen / broken, I just buy a new one and restore my seed on it. Having the seed as backup is free, having an extra hardware wallet gathering dust in the closet is $60 I could have bought Bitcoin with

beware of paper wallets. they are a hassle to set up if you want to do it right. It has to be on an offline Linux computer with an old style printer (unless you know how to disable all the caching and print spooling on new printers). If you do a paper wallet wrong, you can lose your bitcoin. don't do what a lot of noobs are doing and enter your seed words or private key on some "paperwalletgenerator" website. A lot of those are scam websites that will steal all your bitcoin. If you are gonna use a paper wallet, read up on the limitations. You can't spend Bitcoin from a paper wallet, unless you spend every last bit of it in one transaction. In Bitcoin transactions there is outputs. The easy way to explain this is spending from a paper wallet is like using a $20 bill to pay for something that costs $5 at a store that don't give any change. You will lose $15. You don't have that problem when spending Bitcoin from a software/hardware wallet, because the wallet takes care of the outputs. You still pay with a $20 bill, but your change ($15) is sent to a new wallet address that is created using your private key. All of this is done automatically. So to spend $5 from a paper wallet that has $20 in it, you would have to import the paper wallet into a Software/Hardware wallet, so it can take care of the outputs of the transaction. My knowledge on paper wallets are limited, I've never set one up or used them. I could be wrong on some of the points about transaction outputs.
DO NOT: print your paper wallet at the office or an internet cafe. Networked printers keep a copy of all printed documents on a server. Do not print it on your home printer unless you took the necessary precautions. Home printers cache printed documents, and the print spooler in Windows also keeps a copy of the document (if it is set up that way). If you take your computer or printer to be repaired or if anyone gets physical access to your computer they can find a copy of your paper wallet if they know where to look.

I lost too much money with Alts, so I will only have Bitcoin during the next halving.
Yes you could have greater results than Bitcoin. During the last bull run of 2017 there were many alts that outperformed Bitcoin.
The metric you want to look at is the % increase in price. If you have $100 in Bitcoin (0.0294117647 BTC) and you have $100 in an Alt coin, and both of them goes up 5%, you made $5 profit each.
Don't fall into the trap of thinking this coin is cheaper than that one, so I can buy more of it. Everything goes up in percentages, and like I showed above it doesn't really matter how 'units' of a coin you have (0.1 Bitcoin or 10,000 coins from a cheap Alt), if the Dollar value is the same you'll make the same profit when they both rise the same %

@_date: 2019-02-03 10:52:08


That's correct.


Yes, if you don't give your name to the guy you are buying from, you are still anonymous.


The Bitcoin blockchain is public. The guy you bought BTC from will have your wallet address, because he had to transfer to it. He or anyone else on the internet can see how much BTC you have in that original wallet, even if you make new BTC deposits to it. They can see the balance and transactions but they don't know to whom the wallet belongs to.
If you were to transfer those BTC to one of your exchange wallets, that is linked to your name via KYC, then through chain analysis it can be determined that you are the owner of the original wallet.


"own account", do you mean bank account? Usually all the Fiat to Bitcoin on-ramps (like Coinbase) have KYC, so if you transfer money from your own bank account to buy Bitcoin it's not going to be anonymous. If you mean to use your bank account to transfer money to buy Bitcoin from someone, then it won't be 100% private because there's a "paper trail". Just use cash instead, it's untraceable (to a certain extend; bc it has serial numbers). No wonder it's still the favorite for criminals and money laundering.
There are Bitcoin tumblers where you pay a fee, then it mixes your bitcoin with other people's BTC and gives everyone their bitcoin back. Very difficult to track bitcoin back to you.
**Be careful** and do research which tumbler to use. There are going to be scam sites stealing your bitcoin. A safe way would be not to transfer from your main wallet. If you want to tumble 0.2 BTC, then transfer that into a new wallet, and only use the wallet that 1 time for the tumbling.
Other options to preserve privacy is to send your Bitcoin to an exchange with no KYC or a decentralized exchange (DEX), then buy a privacy coin like Monero, and convert the Monero back to BTC again. Send the BTC to a new anonymous wallet.

@_date: 2019-02-13 11:06:37
easiest explanation is it's an alphanumeric (hexadecimal) password that is 64 characters long. A wallet uses the [Private Key]( to give you access to Bitcoin stored on the blockchain (a ledger or database with wallet addresses containing different Bitcoin balances). With the private key you can send Bitcoin, you can receive Bitcoin using your Public Key.
The **Private Key** is the equivalent of your online banking login username + password. It's should be stored securely.
The **Public Key** is the same as your bank account number and routing number. You can give this to people so you can receive coins into your wallet.

Because litecoin is a fork of BTC there should be a way to recover it. I know there was a way to recover bcash if it was sent to a Bitcoin wallet (don't know if that only works one way or both).

Welcome to this roller coaster ride!
Also a late buyer here. Heard about Bitcoin in 2011 when it went to $10. Didn't buy because I couldn't see why "magic internet money" that a bunch of computer nerds came up with will have any value in real life. Why would an online retailer ship you something after you send them some "numbers" from your computer? Didn't hear one thing about Bitcoin for 6 years. Finally bought some in 2017 @ $4,500.
Some quick tips :
1) don't trust anybody. always assume they are trying to get your Bitcoin. Be cautious of "friendly strangers" on the internet. (even me).
2) If you are in the States, use Square Cash App to buy Bitcoin. You can withdraw your coins instantly whereas Coinbase makes you wait 7-10 days. Coinbase also has higher fees. Cash app doesn't show any fees, but their fees are hidden in the form of a higher spot buy price. Coinbase has a minimum fee of $1, so if you use them to buy $5 of Bitcoin, you are wasting money on fees. Effectively losing 20% of every $5 on fees. Rather use cash app with no minimum fee. If a recurring monthly buy is your reason for using Coinbase, then just use cash app and set a monthly reminder on your phone to "buy BTC". It literally takes me 30 seconds to open up cash app and buy BTC. If the cash app verification (to withdraw btc to own wallet) fails, try again, that's what I did and it worked. I did a test and bought $1000 of BTC from both and I got $14 more Bitcoin using cash app compared to Coinbase with its fees. 
3) Don't become an Alt coin maximalist. You'll hear them say crap like, "Bitcoin is old outdated technology" which is somewhat true. The internal combustion engine is also very old technology from the 1800's, yet it's still the dominant form of transport today. If you want the most secure network on earth, use BTC. If you want instant transactions, use LN. For other reasons, use an Alt coin. Not saying you shouldn't buy some Alt coins, but be careful, some are scams (exit, pump &amp; dump or imitation scams like bcash). There's only one cryptocurrency that's been here from the start, alts on the other hand come and go. Some don't even last a year. Same goes for ICO's / IEO's or whatever 3 letter shit they come up with next to get people's money.
4) Don't use an exchange to store your coins (except when busy trading) , keep it in your own wallet. Exchanges are often hacked because they are huge targets. Sometimes the owners of the exchange exit scam (run away with everybody's coins like Quadriga CX) or they go bankrupt (Mt Gox or more recently Cryptopia after they got hacked)
5) learn about the different ways people get their Bitcoin stolen, like Physhing (through fake wallets or fake websites that look just like the real one) Don't assume you are on the correct website, always make sure by checking site certificates. Make sure your computer security is up to date (anti-virus, adware/Spyware, screen recorders &amp; keyboard loggers). 
6) Being your own bank comes with a lot of responsibility. With Bitcoin, there's no customer service to run to because you lost your login credentials or sent Bitcoin to the wrong wallet address. This means you have to double check everything you do, and always assume someone or some software is trying to scam you. A lot of people get scammed or physhed and ends up losing cryptocurrency. In most of these cases it could have been avoided if the person didn't trust so easily. In Bitcoin there's a saying: **"Don't trust, Verify"**, which brings me to the next section.
7) WALLET &amp; WEBSITE SAFETY : When you download a wallet file, you have to make sure that it is indeed the real wallet and not a fake wallet that scammers wants you to download. They want you to think that you are using the real wallet. It even looks exactly like the real one. But when you enter your seed or private keys into this wallet, your info gets sent to them. They then enter your seed into the real wallet and empty out the bitcoin you had in there. This is why you have to verify you have the real wallet file downloaded.
* Make sure you are on the original wallet website. For Electrum this is electrum.org (I'm not going to link you to it). Read the URL. watch out for small "mistakes" in the spelling. This can include stuff like substituting 0 (zero) with O (letter o) or L and 1 (one), or in the case of Electrum, something like "Electrun". Smaller tricks they do but harder to spot is using unicode characters that has a little dot or accent on it like this "Eleċtrum" (notice the small dot on c)
* watch out for overly friendly people on the internet trying to help you click on a link. Even if the link says [Eletrum]( Like this link I just gave you, it goes to Microsoft website, but a scammer could make it go to his fake 'electrun' website.
* Check the site certificate. It's a small green Lock icon next to the URL. Websites have certificates which are verified by companies like Gandi, DigiCert inc, VeriSign Inc...and more. This proves that you are on the right website and did not get redirected to the physhing (fake) site. Look for the company name or URL of the wallet in the certificate.
* Verify the digital signature of the file with GnuPG (you can download opensource software for this, Kleopatra). Before the wallet file gets uploaded to the Downloads page, the file is signed by the developer. You have to also get their public GnuPG key to test if the file you have is the same file that they uploaded. Scammers can't download the original file, change it and upload it again. The digital signature won't match.
* Other ways to verify downloaded files is by getting the MD5/SHA1/SHA256 checksum from the download page. Download a MD5/SHA file checksum checker (software) and test the downloaded file. This is not the safest option, because if you are on a fake website the scammer will make sure that his fake wallet file will also match the checksum he provides on his fake download page. Scammers can't download the original file, change it with their extra lines of programming and upload it again because the checksum won't match with the checksum provided on the legitimate download website.
Always double check the wallet address when sending cryptocurrency. I don't check the whole 64 character long string, but only the 1^st and last 5, This is because of malware called "Clippers" (like a computer virus) that monitors your clipboard for when you Copy a crypto wallet address to paste it into a wallet to send funds. This Clipper then intercepts the recipient wallet address and changes it to the scammer's own wallet address. This way, you click "paste" to send crypto but instead you pasted the scammer's wallet address and he gets the funds.

There's reasons why Satoshi Nakamoto settled on 10 minute small 1 MB blocks.
If you increase the block size it will lead to centralization. Bcash and faketoshi coins are proof of this. A bigger block requires more hard drive space. Less people will be able to run their own node.
The 10 minute block time has to do with block propagation. 10 minutes gives the network enough time so that all the miners and nodes are on the same page to prevent chain splits

Mining difficulty adjusts every {2016 Blocks}^edit {approximately}^edit 2 weeks. The amount of miners on the network does not affect the price. It only affects the profitability of the miners. As more miners get on the network, the difficulty rises which causes the miners with older hardware to become less profitable until they break even and shuts off their miners, which causes less mining difficulty. It's a never ending cycle that will continue regardless if Bitcoin prices fell to $100. At that price there will be a lot less people mining, but the difficulty would be "easy" so they can still make money.
The difficulty adjustment is to keep the block times around 10 minutes average.
Aantonop has a good video explaining Bitcoin mining and difficulty.


Yes. But when the difficulty decreases, miners that had their ASICs shut off because the difficulty was too high for them to make money, will turn their miners on which will increase the difficulty again.

There's 2 way's to buy bitcoin using coinbase. 1 - Use the coinbase app (high fees and a 7-10 day waiting period before you can move the Bitcoin), or 2) use your coinbase username and log into Coinbase Pro and set a Limit Buy order for a 0.15% fee.
You will need to have $ in your Coinbase Pro account to create the limit buy order. you can transfer $ from your USD wallet in the coinbase app, or you can click on the 'deposit' button inside coinbase pro to link a bank account to fund coinbase pro. it takes a few days for the bank transfer to complete, then you can buy Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) with less fees than the coinbase app.

1 - Square Cash App - buy and transfer instantly  
2 - coinbase app - buy, wait 7-10 days before getting access to your Bitcoin
on both of these you will have to provide your ID to register.

From your article:


I think your wording is a bit wrong. one hundredth of a million is: 1,000,000 / 100 = 10,000 , which means there's 10,000 Satoshi's in a Bitcoin. Incorrect.
What I think you meant to say was: *Each bitcoin 1.00000000 is divisible by one hundred million* or: Each satoshi represents one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin


"on to" can be 2 words, but used in this context it should be 'onto', like you used 'onto' in the 4^th paragraph ("*...everything that goes onto the blockchain*")


I know you want to keep it simple, but I would add something like "When somebody sends a bitcoin **(or a fraction thereof)**". Just to emphasize that it is possible to buy or send less than a 'full bitcoin'. The target audience of your article are likely the same people that say: "Bitcoin is too expensive at $5000, I don't have that much money to buy a bitcoin". The old misconception that you HAVE to buy a whole bitcoin.

The amount of BTC has nothing to do with how fast it will confirm. The transaction fee measured in Satoshi's per Byte will determine how fast the miners will include it in the next block. Other factors like the mining difficulty will decide how fast the block times are and will have an impact on the total transaction speed

reducing the miners does not suddenly stop the block rewards. There's still other miners who will mine, find blocks and claim the 12.5 BTC.
If all the Chinese miners stopped mining today, the difficulty would be really high for the remaining miners in the rest of the world. Block times would not be 10 minutes anymore but longer, until the difficulty adjustment happens. Then it would be business as usual after that with the difficulty adjusted down to match with the amount of miners on the network.

You saved the seed words. great. BUT, before you put any funds on the Ledger, did you test your seed words to see if it works.  
If you didn't I would recommend you do it for peace of mind.  
1) empty your ledger, put all coins back on exchanges or a specific wallet for every coin. ONLY download Electrum for Bitcoin, from official electrum.org website.
2) when ledger is empty enter pin wrong 3 times, or go into ledger settings and do a factory reset / wipe
3) get your seed words and restore the ledger
It's better to know that your seed words are correct when your ledger is empty, than NEEDING your seed words to work when your ledger is stolen/broken

I think you are confusing "transaction fee" with "transaction value" in Bitcoin.
You can send a 500 BTC transaction with 1 sat/byte fee.
I'll send a 0.1 BTC transaction with a 50 sat/byte fee, and I can guarantee you that mine will confirm long before yours.
I repeat, the BTC value of a transaction has zero to do with how fast it will be included in the next block. The miners don't get paid from the transaction value, they get the fee.
If you can't understand this basic principle of Bitcoin, I don't have the time to explain it to you any further.

Is this 2016 block difficulty adjustment the right way to go. Let's say at the 2nd block after the new adjustment a huge mining business closes, or large amounts of hash power gets moved over to mining something else. Then the difficulty would be too high for the remaining miners to complete blocks in 10 minutes.
Wouldn't a shorter difficulty adjustment of 24 hours (144 blocks) be better, or is there a technical reason for such a long time between difficulty adjustments?
What stops a bad actor like Bitmain to bring hashing power into BTC and out again right around the time of the diff adjustment to mess around and 'lock in' the difficulty so they can profit. Like for instance, before block 2016 remove hash power, so the difficulty is low for the next ~2 weeks, then they add their tons of hash power and effectively mine at a low difficulty, or just to mess with Bitcoin to promote their Bitmain Cash (BCH). (I think I just answered my own question, Other people will also have the same 'low' difficulty)

Exactly what DILHOL3 said. You have to use the exchange side of coinbase, called Coinbase Pro .  . Log in with your coinbase username. Click on 'deposit' button, then select 'Bitcoin' as currency, deposit from Coinbase wallet. It doesn't cost any fees to transfer between Coinbase and their exchange coinbase pro. It is also instant, because they just shuffle some numbers around on their servers so it is not an on-chain transaction.
In coinbase pro set a limit sell order for the price you want to sell at. When the BTC price climbs to your sell price, the order will execute and you will have USD ($) in your coinbase pro account. You say it isn't that much money, so you can leave it in there and when the BTC price goes down and you think it's low enough to buy back in, create a Limit Buy order that will buy when the price falls to your limit buy price.
the fees on coinbase pro (0.15% for limit orders) is less than the coinbase app.

From the Article:


















Legal slugfest
Coinlab, which has been backed by Tim Draper, Barry Silbert and Roger Ver (among others), entered into a partnership with Mt. Gox in 2012 to essentially act as the exchange’s U.S. branch. However, Coinlab sued Mt Gox in 2013 alleging that the exchange had failed to honor the agreement and asking for $75 million.
Mt. Gox then counter-sued, claiming it was Coinlab who breached their agreement. Neither case was resolved prior to Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy filing, though Coinlab did stake a claim against the exchange at the time of the filing.
“Coinlab originally put in a bankruptcy claim originally of $75 million which people thought was excessive … When we went to civil rehabilitation, everyone refiled the same claim, but Coinlab filed $16 billion,” Pag explained.
Edgar Sargent, a U.S. based attorney for Coinlab, told CoinDesk that he could not speak to the amount filed in Japan, and was not familiar enough with Japanese law or court proceedings to discuss the matter. Coinlab’s Japanese attorneys could not be reached for comment. Coinlab founder Peter Vessenes did not respond to a request for comment.
The first problem stems from the fact that the Mt Gox trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, normally attributes voting rights to creditors based on the size of their stake. This cannot happen with Coinlab until the claim is assessed.
Pag explained:
    “Because it’s pending and it’s still disputed, the trustee can’t attribute fair voting rights if it’s accepted or zero voting rights if it’s rejected but … until it’s [resolved] the trustee can’t give them voting rights … It looks like it’s stalled.”
It could take the bankruptcy judge anywhere from several months to a year just to assess the claim. If Coinlab’s claim is rejected, the company can then litigate it in court, which would take another year. If the court rejects Coinlab’s claim, the company can then appeal, which would also take some time.
All told, Pag estimates that resolving whether or not Coinlab has a credible claim can take between 18 and 24 months.
Once that is resolved, only then can the creditors vote on a civil rehabilitation plan (and there is always a chance that there may be competing plans). Depending on the outcome, the potential payout to creditors will be dramatically different as well.
“We’ve started that process but it’s not finished and it’s not confirmed, it’s not confirmed that we’re in civil rehabilitation until the creditors vote on a civil rehabilitation plan,” Pag said.
Coinlab’s claim
Speaking generally, Sargent told CoinDesk that Coinlab’s suit comes from “a good claim,” adding that “it’s not just something that we made up.”
He confirmed to CoinDesk that he participated in a brief AMA on Reddit a few weeks ago, where he noted that Mt. Gox did not obtain a dismissal when Coinlab first sued the exchange, which it could have done “if the case were frivolous.”
In an email, however, former Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles told CoinDesk that Coinlab performed “close to zero” work for the exchange.
“Courts are likely to consider CoinLab’s case with some matter of urgency today and will likely try to get things handled quickly, but CoinLab has likely no interest of bringing a losing battle to its conclusion, and will likely try to extend the process as much as possible,” he said.
Coinlab is in a position of strength right now, “as they hold hostage the whole of Mt Gox’s distribution process,” though the company could end the situation quickly by signing a settlement. If a settlement is signed quickly, bitcoin distribution can begin by the end of 2019.
This might be the plan too – according to Pag, “a lot of creditors feel like it’s a very conscious strategy to try and force a settlement from the trustee. Most creditors don’t want them to receive a penny.”
While both Pag and his attorney have tried to reach out to the Wada Law Firm, which is representing Coinlab in Japan, neither has received any response.
Mt. Gox Legal is, in Pag’s words, the largest creditor group for Mt Gox. There are currently more than 1,000 members claiming more than 150,000 bitcoin, good for roughly 15 percent of the total value owed to creditors.
The group was founded in fall 2017 to advocate for Mt Gox’s shift from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation.
“It started around 18 months ago when it became clear that the price of bitcoin was rising and the assets of the Mt Gox trustee was going to be more than the liabilities,” Pag explained. “Top Japanese lawyers are very expensive so [we pooled together].”
Mt. Gox Legal filed for the shift, possibly setting a number of legal precedents in Japan along the way. Pag explained that under such a transition, a company does not normally move from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, adding:
    “It’s rekindling the legal entity enough that you can distribute assets but not restart it as a business.”
Pag is currently the coordinator for the group, with his activities overseen by a board of governors. Over the last 18 months, he’s flown to Japan a number of times to communicate with Kobayashi and gather updates for the members of the group.
“We’re quite a considerable creditor body and we’ve spent some time building up a relationship with all the players, the trustee, other creditor groups [and] law firms,” he said.
At the end of April, he’ll be stepping down.
“The more bitcoin’s price goes up, the more vultures are circling around. My personal worry is that we’re just going to be bogged down in litigation,” he said. “For me personally, and it’s a personal decision, it makes more sense to sell my claim.”
Mt. Gox Legal’s board has already begun the process to replace him, opening up nominations to bring in a new coordinator. While a new coordinator has not yet been confirmed, Pag expects that the group will likely shift into a hibernation state, as there will not be a lot that can happen until the legal claims have been sorted out.
Moving on
Rather than wait for the court system to sort out whether Coinlab has a legitimate claim, Pag said he intends to sell his claim, step down from Mt. Gox Legal and move on with his life.
“I’ve put my career on hold for 18 months and … It’s just a big regret that we’ve kind of been outplayed by other parties,” he said:
    “In 2014 I had this money sitting there and it was this great big windfall and it was amazing and I had all these plans that I was going to put into place with it. It’s not losing the money that stung, it’s losing those plans and not being able to doing those things I wanted to do, and there’s a bit of a repeat here.”
A New York-based investment firm will purchase Pag’s claim for $600 per bitcoin. While he declined to name the firm, Pag said if other creditors reached out, he’d be happy to put them in touch.
“This isn’t the windfall that I was hoping for but it’s still a windfall and it’s a windfall today,” he said.
Pag said he has seen some backlash for this decision, which he understands. However, “this is a really personal decision that everyone needs to make for themselves,” he added.
He is not making a recommendation for other creditors to sell or not sell, Pag said, noting that many creditors have a shared identity born out of the fight to recoup their missing coins.
That being said:
    “I had to ask myself how far do I stand on principle? When do I say enough is enough. Do I want to be right, or do I want to be happy? I’ve decided I’d rather be happy and get on with my life.”

On the Bitcoin blockchain a new block is found by btc miners about every 10 minutes. In terms of time a block is ~10 minutes. If you don't care if your transaction takes 30 minutes to complete, then you can tell the wallet that your transaction is a lower priority, 3 blocks or more, with a lower transaction fee. Higher priority transactions = higher fees.
A block is 1MB of data on the Blockchain containing transactions that needs to be hashed by miners to solve the block, so it can be added to the chain of blocks that contain all the previous historical bitcoin transactions, then a new block is found with the next 10 min worth of transactions that has to be mined, and this all goes on until the last bitcoin is mined around 2140.

The fact that BCH Bitcoin Cash (or Bcash for short) doesn't have a reddit with their own Alt coin name, like r//BitcoinCash but instead uses r//Btc (which is the 'ticker' to identify Bitcoin on exchanges) should tell you there's something fishy about bcash.
Their main circus clown / mascot, Roger "*Bitcoin Judas*" Ver, even has the ownership rights to Www-bitcoin-com, which he is using to scam and confuse people into buying his Alt coin, bcash. He and his cult followers make up different names for the real Bitcoin, shit like "Bitcoin Core" so they can "recommend" you to buy their fake bitcoin cash, which is basically worthless at this point and won't be around for much longer.
If Roger and the rest of his circus dedicated half the time to improving their Alt coin, bcash, instead of scamming and attacking the true Bitcoin, I think things would have worked out differently for them. It also doesn't help that Roger himself is a convicted felon, and most if not all of the rest of the bcash clowns have criminal backgrounds. Not sure about the Wright guy. He might just be a fraud, because he said he was Satoshi Nakamoto. But if he really was Satoshi, all he would have to do to prove it is send 10 sats from one of Satoshi's addresses. He hasn't done that, because he does not have access to the private keys. Because he's a liar.

Yes you're totaly wrong. EMP blast is very high concentration of electromagnetic energy. Electromagnetism is the foundation of how a lot of electric devices work (your electric toothbrush that doesn't seem to have any electric contact points, any "wireless" cellphone charger), and without electromagnetism we would not have any transformers to change voltages.
A transformer works by giving electric current to a primary coil of wires, which in turn induces a current in the secondary coil (which is not hooked up to any electricity). The difference in the amount of wire winding around the 2 coils will determine if it is a *step up* or *step down* transformer. (increasing or decreasing voltage)
Tldr : a device doesn't need to be turned on for the sorcery of invisible electromagnetic energy to affect it.
Before any of you keyboard scientists come with your stupid arguments, because you watched some NatGeo documentary about solar flairs. CME's pose a danger for electric grids, and if a major one were to come straight at us, they will shut down the grid. That's not to cancel out the effect of the solar flair, but to minimize it.
If a transformer is on, and it can handle 1 million volts, then adding another million from the CME will surely make it explode / break. So if you turn the power off, the grid stands a better chance of not being totally destroyed.
A Faraday cage will help, or something similar to how the earth's electromagnetic field keeps us save from solar flairs and cosmic rays.

Not everything is about value. A coin worth $0.01 could still be used the same as a coin with $3,600 value. You're just going to have to use more of the 1c coin to buy stuff.
It failed because nobody was using it. More people were using DOGE than Bcash. Doge was a coin that started as a meme, a joke coin. That's says a lot.
BCH's way of upgrading their tech by just adding bigger blocks was like upgrading your internet connection by adding more 56k modems, instead of better scaling by updating the technology. That's why we have 100Mbit fiber internet today, and not 2 rooms in your house full of stacks of 56k modems.
Besides bcash's inferior scaling method, all the scammers,criminals and bad actors (roger,faketoshi,calvin, jihan....) involved with the coin didn't do it any favors.

None of it is automatic. First you are going to transfer funds from your bank to the USD wallet in the coinbase app. Link a bank account to your Coinbase app and go to USD wallet to initialize the transfer. After few days money is in your Coinbase USD wallet. Go to  [pro.coinbase.com]( and log in with your Coinbase username. Look for deposit, deposit from USD wallet to transfer money into coinbase pro. Alternatively, you can skip the whole USD wallet part, just log into coinbase pro and start a "add funds from bank acc" (the deposit button) to transfer money from a bank directly into Coinbase Pro.
You now have $ in your Coinbase pro account. If you use the Market Buy order, you're going to pay the market price and pay a fee. This fee might be a little less than the usual Coinbase app fee (I'm not sure).
If you don't want to pay a fee, you have to use Limit Orders. If you place a limit buy order you are saying you are willing to buy a certain amount of bitcoin @ a certain price (you choose).
If the market price moves in the direction of your limit buy order price, and it matches that your order is at the top of the order book (buy side), and someone else executes a market sell order they are selling their bitcoin to you at the price you are asking and they are paying the fee.
Now you might want to hold on before trying to Limit buy BTC for $50 or Limit sell BTC for $100,000. The $50 order will never fill, who is going to sell you their 1 btc for $50. The $100k order should fill in the next couple of years. So you see, your buy order will only get filed if it equals the market price.
In your situation you'd want to wait for btc to make a peak, then pull back lower. You want your limit buy order somewhere between the peak, and the next lower support level where you think it will drop to before climbing again. If you aim too low with your buy price, btc might drop down to just above your price and go up again to make another peak. Your limit buy order will not get filled because there were other orders above your order willing to pay a higher price. People market selling btc will always get the highest price anybody is willing to pay for it, that is the limit buy order at the very top of the buy order book.
If I didn't explain it too good, just Google "placing limit orders coinbase pro"

**Don't listen to this dude.** Bitpay is not Bitcoin friendly, nor user friendly. Haven't used it, but I've seen a lot of posts from people having a really hard time getting it to work. There's a bunch of crap you gotta do to BTC addresses or something to get the receiving address into the "correct" Bitpay format. 
If you need to store bitcoin, use a pc wallet like Electrum or one of the others people named. If you have the seed words from armor or your private keys, just import into Electrum wallet. There's no 200GB download needed.
Remember to back up your seed phrase. A better, more secure option is getting a hardware wallet (ledger nano s) if you also want to store other crypto besides BTC.
Other wallets to stay away from:
* **Bitcoin.com** - basically a bitcoin cash (bcash) site where they ~~"Recommend"~~ ^Scam people to buy BCH bcash, which might have the name Bitcoin in there, but it's not even close to the same level as BTC.

When you buy on coinbase you can't transfer your coin within 7 days. It is on hold, and slowly gets "released". So by about the 3rd day you can transfer half of your new purchased bitcoin out.

The whole "Bitcoin shouldn't be a store of value" preposition was probably started by the bcash mascots and their sock puppets. "well, can you buy coffee with bitcoin 'core'"
I don't see why it can't be both. If you bought Bitcoin in Q3 2017, then you're still not sold on the store of value part. But longtime btc holders are still up 1000x and more. So it is a good store of value.
Is it a currency? You can go buy a coffee with bitcoin LN and the fee is going to be around 1 sat and almost instant transaction. So it is a good currency as well.
It can be both.

Not really. Another way would be to fund your Coinbase pro account with $ before, at least 10 days before you want to buy bitcoin. Then you buy btc on coinbase pro (the old Gdax).
I know this isn't helping your situation because it will still take more than 7 days to get your bitcoin.
There are other ways to buy bitcoin, faster than coinbase. Haven't tried any of them. Heard there's a Cash app. Do some research first before you get the app, there might be fake scam ones.

It blocks all forms of wireless signals from wifi to Bluetooth, NFC, RFID signals.
It's what they are using on these wallets you get that are safe for credit cards with the new RFID wireless chips. The wallet has a woven steel mesh between the layers, which acts as a Faraday cage. No signal can get into your wallet.
**Edit:** Turns out the thieves stealing or cloning your card details with a RFID chip reader is bullshit. NOT 1 incident of this exists. Not your PIN, card number or 3 digit security code is transmitted. It has been proven to be secure. The code that is transmitted changes with every transaction. So not only is the RFID chip a bank vault, it's a bank vault with a security code that changes every minute.
Only thing I can think of is that the "Faraday Cage Wallet" manufacturers started this bullshit story to sell their wallets.

They are not exactly the same thing. 
In the USA your checking accounts usually have low to 0 fees, but it also has 0% interest.
So people also have a savings account that pays interest. A lot of people struggle to save money. If all their money goes into one account they spend it. So they let some of their paycheck transfer into the savings account. They deliberately don't have a debit card linked to the savings account so they can't spend it easily.

Use coinbase pro (Gdax). It costs 0 fees to deposit fiat, then put a limit buy order on coinbase pro to buy without fees. The guy on the other side of the order book (market sell) picks up the fee.

"threatened", lol. The better question is rather why do you guys need to impersonate the real Bitcoin and trick noobs and their grannies into buying bcash thinking they're buying BTC. Why not just concentrate on your coin and its technology. If it really is better than BTC, then the free market will decide. Why bring dying babies into all of this. Why hijack another crypto meetup/conference and pretend it was all about BCH. Can any of you BCH fans see that Roger is doing more harm than good, not only to BCH but crypto in general. The guy is a joke. Yall need to fire him or something

I didn't comment about this meme. This is just some random reddit guy who posted this, it's not like it was the main BTC "mascot" talking about dying babies, or actually calling [people who uses his wallet 'retarded'] ( . But yeah, it's not right that down syndrome kids got dragged into this mud slinging contest. Why is all of this "my coin is bigger than yours" even necessary, we're all on the same team. The bankers and governments enslaving us with their debt based currencies are the real enemy.

Using a BTC debit card to pay where the merchant has the BTC automatically converted to fiat into his bank account is no different than market selling your Bitcoin, then using the cash to pay the merchant.
Bitcoin debit cards are a step in the right direction, but it's not real adoption.

Had the same experience. Was able to buy BTC and withdraw / transfer instantly. Then suddenly I had to wait about 7-10 days because they hold it.
I'm also done buying on Coinbase. Now I use square cash app. Did a test between Coinbase &amp; cash app and for a $1000 purchase you get $14 more Bitcoin.
Square cash app doesn't have fees, but the BTC buy price is usually little higher than Coinbase

The block halving has nothing to do with the difficulty.
Only thing I can think of what you might mean is that miners that were barely making money will leave when the block reward goes down 50%.
That's not a problem. The difficulty adjustment would kick in and it will be back to business as usual. The network will work fine with less miners. It could be a bit slower for a couple of days depending on when the last difficulty adjustment happened.
You are right that the block reward halving has nothing to do with price. The price increasing after the halving has to do with basic economic principles of supply &amp; demand. If demand stays the same and supply decreases, the commodity (BTC) becomes more scarce, which leads to higher prices.

You can actually send to the wrong chain, and still get your coins back. But it is a complicated process. I've read there are people that help recover btc that was send to bch.
But yeah, I know what you mean by not sending to the wrong chain.

The problem is not that Robin hood doesn't have a wallet for you to withdraw out of. Buying BTC on Robin hood is not Bitcoin. Robin hood crypto isn't real, that's why you can't withdraw it. It is "paper crypto". It doesn't exist in any blockchain because it is derivatives or options or whatever.
Coinbase app has the highest fees. Coinbase pro (formerly Gdax) used to have 0% maker fees. You could fund your Coinbase USD wallet then transfer to Coinbase pro, or just deposit fiat directly in Coinbase pro and limit order buy Bitcoin with no fees. In March they changed the fees. now you pay 0.15% fees on Coinbase pro and more for market orders (0.25%)
If you are in USA your best option is square cash app. I'm not using Coinbase anymore because of the fees &amp; the stupid 10 day hold on funds.
I did a test between Coinbase and cash app. Bought $1000 BTC from both, at the same time. The purchase from cash app gave me $14 more Bitcoin compared to Coinbase.
I know stuff like slippage can skew this experiment. I did it again, (smaller amount) and cash app won again.
I don't mind that cash app hides their fees in the spread (higher BTC buy price), all I care about is how much bang for buck I'm getting for my fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:21:52
Correct on the 6.25 BTC.
it has to do with market forces (supply vs demand). If there's too much supply, like 12.5 BTC/10 mins, the price is low. Decreasing the supply, like halving the block reward, should increase price like it did with all the previous block reward halvings.
The miners have less BTC to sell, so it creates less selling pressure which gives the buyers an easier chance to start a bull run.

Agree with the other guy. Only roger vermin and his bcasher sock puppets calls BTC "core". Bitcoin Core was the name given to the client, I think it's the program you run on your computer if you're a node.

Who sees the pattern here?
These are all anti Bitcoin companies. They range from bitpay being super user un-friendly with their stupid address format to send Bitcoin, blockchain.com refusing to implement Segwit and off course Bitcoin.Com where roger "Recommends" noobs and their grannies to buy his scam coin, bcash.
