@_date: 2015-01-27 20:16:27
its also terrible how they only look like they work for 2 hrs a day
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:20:54
honestly i didnt see it, i just registered with btc markets and they are clear "verify before sending us money"
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:01:02
my passport hasnt expired its till 2019 i opened up a ticket and "julie" isnt helpful if this is the "norm" then maybe not advertise as quick and easy, you guys took my money without being verified 
@_date: 2015-01-28 08:31:45
i wish i knew that igot was like pushing shit up hill when i signed up
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:15:59

@_date: 2015-01-28 20:42:04

@_date: 2015-01-26 22:52:54

your name is kl so it really sounds dodgy if your avoiding using id and only want paypal
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:27:11
well sounds like your buying child porn or something, you say your new with it yet you say you have bought it before......
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:02:42
yes please keep listing, and then tell me how australia didnt need the french to be come independent and how usa did
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:24:16
not at all, you can buy btc with id, but your exchange with who your buying with is the private bit, well more private
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:02:44
well mr USA bitcoin came out of australia not usa, wifi came out of australia not usa, what did come out of usa?
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:39:47
maybe google will help you more as all your questions just leave a huge trail in your illegal ways
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:37:13


hahah so why not use yahoo answers? you cant be that proud you have a system that allows someone who has very small hands as your president 
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:36:27
so then just use your id and buy it like anyone else
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:17:01
are you in EU?
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:32:04
im in eu and i buy whole collections, what series are we looking at?
@_date: 2015-02-13 00:27:43
oh so if i use a vpn then you totally ignore it? rick you guys said you would sort your shit out, i missed out on a deal due to you guys and also have been fearful of trying to order pizza for fear it will take 24 hrs to pay for the food with MY btc, and this is a constant problem with many users of your service, no apology just rude customer service, you advertise transactions within seconds, can you find me any reddit users who have had a 100% positive experience&gt;?
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:28:01
havnt heard great things about coinjar so am giving btcmarkets a try
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:38:51
im hot and miss, now it asked me if i was transfering my btc to another service for my last trade *sigh*
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:08:14
try bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:58:57
how hard is it to send bitcoins with igot.com, near impossible!
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:20:45
so you have BTC and want USD? there are many sites you could use but you need to verify your self and if you cant scan your documents well your caught out, how many BTC are we talking about
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:40:59
a flag everytime mr rick from igot? you have copies of every id and bank from both countries , and as my super disposable income is in OZ thats where the deposits come from
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:51:45
yes! i am level 2 verified which is there highest level, they told me last time i would be on auto approval, its all painful i will try a few places and see how it changes
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:58:10
well i am located in europe for the next 6 months but all my bank accounts and id are australian as i am , you guessed it, australian
