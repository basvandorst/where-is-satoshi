LOL  was thinking the exact same thing.
and if they tried, it's not like they can keep that sort of action under the collective radar of everyone involved.

the only part of my post pertaining to your comment was the first line.  The entire second part was directed at the post above yours, in an attempt continue the discussion.  You may note I ended it with an invitation to hear output from others, and in fact I was trying to skip over your post that didn't directly contribute to the discussion imho.
point is you're too defensive to hear :)  I'm more interested in talking about coin than trying to prove perfect strangers wrong.
I'm done responding to you, please feel free to have the last word if you like.  Have a nice day!

not sure how wise it is to compare government attitudes towards rape vs. possible financial crimes.
your statement seems to imply there's something functionally illegal about ICOs, whereas I personally tend to believe they are a legal activity with a high propensity for abuse.
This isn't seniors getting ripped off;  I think the SEC in general recognizes that crypto in general is too geeky for the common man, and geeks ought to be able to do their own d/d.
just an opinion, interested in hearing others!

exactly, another potential roadblock to SEC action.  what can they really do apart from issue guidance?  which, should be enough in my eyes.  Again we're talking about people who ought to know better than to get scammed.  Nobody's forcing anyone to buy and it's not like uninformed people are taking out reverse mortgages to buy, at least as far as I am aware.

This is exactly why the concept of accredited investors came into play.
imho, if you're fucking around in crypto and have enough sense to figure out how to actually *get* some, then that accomplishment alone makes you an "accredited crypto investor."

you're also then minimizing the attention grabbing headlines.  It's easier for people to picture big gains in dollars, not percentage moves.
It's a great idea however I don't think this issue is holding up general acceptance.  What's holding up general acceptance is, quite frankly, lack of general acceptance.

you sure about that?  a reply doesn't necessarily imply that the full content is in direct reply to your statements;  in hindsight I ought to have made two different posts.
I understand exactly what you meant, I just don't believe using rape cases as part of your analogy will further a legitimate discussion.  In very rare cases, those do happen here :)
