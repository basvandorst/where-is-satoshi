While I get that $20 is a lot of money for some, of you are using the internet, it probably isn’t all that much.

Perhaps I missed it, but that only shows SegWit adoption, says nothing about implementing LN.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:56:25

How much on chain transaction volume do you thing the exchanges are processing?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:34:29
Really, do you really believe that 80-90% of all global on chain transactions are solely Coinbase sending to users wallets? I'm not buying it. Do you have any source for your claim?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:56:02
Where did you get that number? I would be awfully surprised and concerned if coinbase transactions were 20% of the global bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:51:55
If it is true, then it is kind of a bummer don't you think? The only use for Bitcoin is to speculate on it by sending it to exchanges and trading? This was supposed to be the internet of money, to free us from the banks, not just to be a speculative asset to be traded.
It is what it is I suppose, but it sure wasn't what I expected it to be back in 2011.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:18:43
Very, very, good point. Even if they implement segwit, what % of global transaction volume do they have? I'm guessing way less than 1%
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:53:24
I used to buy things with Bitcoin. My local liquor store used to take it, but not anymore with fees 30USD+. Just isn't feasible.

Only the 500 largest US companies. But as you said ...not tied to anything at all.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:02:20
Correct. Openassets is just the protocol, very similar to counterparty.
Depending on who they issue shares to will be the question, if they keep it in a closed loop (sold only on specific exchanges, or none at all), then they can control the KYC/taxation/compliance processes.
Edit: however, I have no idea how they will be issued. Reading around sounds like it may be more open, should be interesting.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:28:39
I don't know how you can say it is not tied to anything when it is specifically an index of the largest 500 market caps in US equities. It has to be tied to something or the index value would be 0.
If you mean it is not an ETF or fund like SPY or a mutual fund with actual underlying assets you are correct.

@_date: 2017-12-24 16:15:35
That’s trading volume off chain. Has nothing to do with Segwit adoption. We are talking about on chain transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:36:49
Okay, we are in agreement. It just a bit disingenuous to say 'it's not tied to anything real' though.

@_date: 2014-10-09 18:54:07
I had about 4 transactions go though on Circle (added my bank and CC) - just before the public launch. As of last week none of my transactions go through - pending to canceled. I need to send them my ID and a bill with my name on it due to their fraud protection.
I understand the need, just a bit annoying since I was using it with no issues for about 2 weeks and have verified a bank account.

Never heard about it either until a week before the IPO. I'm from the US if it makes a difference.

Not necessarily. If you create a similar looking onion address it would be pretty trivial to create a valid certificate for the fake url (not sure how hard it is to get a valid ssl cert for a .onion, just know it has been done).

The thing I don't get is if the community looses confidence in bitcoin entirely, won't GHash and CEX be destroying their own business, not to mention their own investments. I just don't understand how they can think this is acceptable.
I personally believe they already have at least 55% of the hashing power, but they are obscuring it behind unknown IPs and other pools. 
I just don't get it and it pisses me off.
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:58:53
I would say currently no, micro payments work well with bitcoin at present (because we have not saturated the max tps). In the future it is a big maybe, but I believe the issues will be resolved.

Not at all. All darkweb markets (Inc. SR2) are centralized entities, OpenBazaar is completely decentralized.

It is totally possible, and there are some known issues with Tor (compromised exits, etc..).
As long as there is transport layer security (node to node communication), and a reputation system, Tor is really just an additional safety feature.
It took LE 1 year to take down SR2, how long would it take to take down 100k nodes?

Even if the algo changes, there will be ASICs designed for it if it is profitable. Even if not, whats to stop a large company from buying the best mining GPUs in sufficient quantities for this to happen again.
Unfortunately, I do not believe it is something as easy as just changing the algorithm.
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:58:35
Merchants selling illegal items will be using OpenBazaar with Tor (to anonymize traffic). This is the same protection SR2 and SR1 had, as well as all the other darkweb marketplaces. It is a problem for LEO to find individual servers, it would be next to impossible to stop everyone without breaking Tor first.
Legitimate sellers wouldn't need to use Tor. Only merchants and clients dealing in the illegals.

I hate to argue about this, but I still don't think this is necessarily true. The default fee is .0001 which at current value is 0.4c, but that is only the default and can be set by anyone.
I just sent a 5 dollar transaction for 0.0037c (0.00001btc) and it was confirmed into the next block 
I would say this is an excellent platform for micropayments. The only drawback is confirmation time (in this case, was less than 5 minutes, but 10 is most acceptable or longer even).

This is not correct. We don't mind sidechains, or LN, or any other L2 solution. We are worried because SW is a one time increase, and if fees continue to grow without a base block size increase, we also wont be able to feasibly use these solutions without relying on third parties to transact on, I.e. a bank's website.
We don't trust that Core will actually provide that base block increase, hence forcing us to use their L2 solution because it is too expensive to transact on chain (even for L2, LN requires a fee for creating, updating, and closing channels).
I love lightning and L2, you will be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:31:51
Sure. I would like to see a CVE time stamped prior to the github commit. Or something that could be considered evidence.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:57:50
You seriously are using the bible as your argument? Whoa.
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:31:24
This has been my experience too. I love bitwage!
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:04:31
We need our Emmanuel Goldstein. That's how this works man!
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:09:47
Do you confirm or deny that you received a message from "charolottegardner"? I would like to hear it from you if possible.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:10:51
Thank you for pointing this out, my apologies! 


Well this is a bummer and will be the contentious point. The only proposal produced so far was Luke's decrease and increase after 2024 as far as I know.
If we could have bundled these two together (a block size increase - not lukes and SW) we would not have been in this position today unfortunately, but here we are.
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:13:04
Ah ha! I found it!

@_date: 2017-03-28 16:37:01
Segwit has been promoted for far longer than 1 year (not released, but promoted) and I don't see anyone calling that dead. It is only at ~30% too.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:58:04
Yes, this was specifically what I was referring to.
Do you know where these proposals are at. Is there a chosen one (aside from Lukes). Any planned implementation after SW?
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:52:26
The whole crux of this debate is a dynamic block size before segwit. That's it. If core came out with this we would all unite under that banner.
I am worried that Core will never deliverer the dynamic block size increase specified in their roadmap, hence making to too expensive to use L2 solutions myself (I.e. opening LN channels, updating LN channels, and closing LN channels). If it is too cost prohibitive to do this, then I am just going to store my BTC at BofA because they have a well connected LN node.
That is the risk I see.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:00:12
Where do you live? Just curious. I can buy ETFs for free with a 0.05% annual expense ratio (VTI for example).
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:23:10
I think it is (as irrational as it is) because the other side does not trust that core will ever increase the base block size. 
I think something like BitcoinEC may be a good proposal to unite both sides again since it signals SW, and has EC code that can be activated, built in. Its not without its own risks though.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:27:01
Is that support as in political, or as in technical? I.e.. rara go segwit, or yes our systems will work if activated?
You certainly seem to be implying the former, but in pretty sure that is a list of the latter.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:27:41


No, not at all. He is against them when the base layer is unable to scale without friction. The article explains this. If EC were to come to fruition, you better believe we will get LN and a malleability fix as well.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:10:50
Fantastic post. I also recommend attending a meetup. It can be quite the eye opener.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:11:12
Me too, where is all my Roger Ver money that I keep hearing about. Also, go BU!
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:31:39
Yep. Flexible Transactions is being considered for a malleability and quadratic hashing fix. I don't think there is any real plan to implement SW at any point. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:10:11


Some of those are pools made up of more than 4 miners. Just FYI.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:18:47
How? They have the keys, how can I steal their money? This is assuming I don't have a LN channel open and that I just have BTC sitting in a drug dealers wallet (which for all intents and purposes is his coin).
Thank you again for having a conversation with me :).
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:38:03
It's the old damned if we do, damned if we don't.
Unfortunately we now have a community (and miners) that are very leery of the plans coming from Core, so they don't want to activate SW as they don't really trust the roadmap (which I think comes from the HK consensus agreement valid or not). The m1oderation here and propaganda certainly don't help this either.
Core is not willing to implement a hard fork at this time but agrees we will need one in the future, but we don't really have any proposals to do this - and are probably staunchly opposed to a HF for the reasons you stated.
BU has a proposal to increase the block size but not SW (but are not necessarily opposed to it). Both teams agree that we need a base block size increase but only one has a solution on the table.
Thanks for taking the time with me. I wish more discussions like this happened here.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:39:42
I will forgive you.. this time :). Have a great weekend @_date: 2017-03-17 13:05:29
Nobody gives a shit about Roger Ver. He is the op of rbtc, tweets all the time, gave some money to BU, but that's it. He does not moderate rbtc at all, and is not a member of BUs internal governance, and sometimes generates conversations around his tweets. 
Literally nobody gives a shit about him, but somehow he has become the Emmanuel Goldstein of This shit is annoying - attack the idea, not the people.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:19:07


I don't see anything wrong with the speed, that's not my concern at all. LN payments are instant when you have a channel open.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:02:16
I never said they are all on the payroll. But a few prominent ones certainly are.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:01:29


That would be 100% pure negligence at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:00:16


This is on the Core roadmap though, so we are both doing it wrong if that's what you truly think.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:40:07
Gotta store it on something right? When your 16GB pen drive runs out of space do you just stop producing data or do you buy another one?
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:44:19
So, who specifically lied again and where? 
E: you know what, I don't actually care. I'm going to bed.
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:37:02
I don't see how this could happen today and it hasn't happened in the past. Could you explain a scenario where this could happen?
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:51:09
What the fuck was the top rated post? This is fucked.
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:37:27
Rent hashrate at nicehash and mine at a pool that supports SW (such as slush). I am also doing to same thing in support of BU. Pretty easy and painless to setup and I just keep reinvesting my earnings back into mining. I am essentially donating these funds though, I don't expect to make any profit whatsoever (just FYI).
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:40:25


I would like to see a citation for this "fact".
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:57:56
Nope, its third party again. Take a brief glance through my comments and you can find the site, github, and reddit post about it.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:31:46
I'm not going to get bated into a pissing match with you. Call me what you will, the information is out there, and people will seek it out and make their own opinions. I see no problem with that.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:55:33
How do you know that everyone's mempool is clear? As far as I know it clears after bitcoind is restarted, how do you know that is not the case here?
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:20:57
So the proposal came out 10 days ago... and isn't a 2-4MB hard fork as proposed by the Hong Kong consensus either.
Yes I do if you want to help convince me, and I appreciate the time you are putting in to do so. I do have an open mind.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:34:21
Ok I activated it.
But seriously, take a scroll through my comments to see my arguments if you really care. I have clearly stated what the risks I see are by not at least including a block size increase along with it.
Come back with an argument from that, sorry I'm getting tired, and I have argued with you specifically before on this.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:55:18
So what? Do you complain about any other organizations internal titles? Would "Lead developer" have been better (because that's all this position is)?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:07:13
But I can't open a channel because it *may* be too expensive without a dynamic block size.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:27:54
Yep, however, I would expect Bitpay might indeed change their tune if they begin to pivot to that other coin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:16:17
Pretty sure he meant merged into production. Tomato tomato.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:53:13
They want it future proofed. They don't want to just kick the can down the road as SFSW would do.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:06:03


Yeah, that's just conjecture.


I suppose so :). Thanks for the conversation!
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:18:57
Vote? Problem then being who gets a vote.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:12:45
That could be something. Do you know if this is on a roadmap anywhere or where I could find more information on that?
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:49:28
Exactly this. Also there is a strong desire for a larger base block size that runs pretty deep as well. Mix the two together and its a strong brew.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:28:14
Could be. BitcoinEC is an interesting proposal though which I feel could garner support and hopefully compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:49:24
Thank you. You are entirely correct - I don't know how I missed that.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:56:05
I personally run a full node on SSD storage (along with quite a few other services). You can do so pretty cheaply ($20) on digital ocean also on SSD storage if you like. Things certainly get a lot cheaper when not on SSD.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:04:09
It was a long way out from 2015 IMO, not so much now in 2017.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:25:02
I really don't know. I think some of the problem is that SW is coded  as a soft fork and not a hard fork like the block size increase will be.
I personally would also like to see Flexible Transactions vetted out as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:38:26
Cool. I like that idea.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:27:48
Do both parties not broadcast a transaction to make a LN channel (i.e. both sides pay a fee)?
Also sorry, my last question was non-nonsensical after reading it again. Apologies for that.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:46:25
Well, it is an alternate, and being considered, I'm sure of that (granted I also don't have a link stating so). It's just not in BU.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:37:32


We don't know this for sure. It is a bitcoin transaction none the less, which required a fee.


I don't know to be honest. Without a dynamic block size, I think the sky could be the limit. With a dynamic block size, I believe an equilibrium will be found.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:28:39


Actually, it is Tom Zander's of Bitcoin classic. I don't know of any plans to merge it into BU as of yet.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:01:21
Awesome! I totally appreciate you doing that! Thanks!
If you are ever in Minneapolis, send me a message, I will definitely buy you a beer.
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:34:18
Yep, used exactly like Emmanuel Goldstein was in 1984. A common enemy to rally against. It really is getting ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:11:36
I think the miners want EC. I honestly don't think they care about BU, BU is just a means to an end.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:47:17
I don't have enough information to say one way or the other on that matter TBH.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:15:53
That's not accurate. Us "big blockers" want Lightning too. Combined with a dynamic block size would be an excellent way to scale bitcoin IMO.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:14:03
It's not obvious to me, as a user.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:45:44
SW is about a 70% increase, Schnorr about 40% on top of that. Not sure about MAST (do you know, I'm curious). Regardless all one time smallish increases (unless MAST is like an 800% increase and I'm just ignorant).
If we had a solid proposal for a hard fork for after all of these things I would be soooo much more inclined to be positive about Cores roadmap, I also think that would make a lot of people happy as well.
But we don't, and here we are.
 
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:45:19
no kidding.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:11:14
Is there a proposal for this or are you just linking me to a repo and expect me to dig through it?
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:37:46
I owe that guy lunch if he is ever in Minneapolis :).
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:45:12
I don't care who discovered it, burn the liars. I do however want a shred of evidence that this person is real and not a smear campaign.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:21:53
I would guess none of the major ones. If your mining node is exposed directly on the internet you have already failed at common sense.
There was no discernible difference in mined blocks signaling BU that I can see.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:55:24


Where is the code? SW has been out for well over 3 months.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:54:02
Is there a CVE number for this yet? I have been asking and waiting for that since the original article was posted. A reserved CVE would go a long way in convincing me. Otherwise this could just be more smear.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:37:23


I guess I used the wrong word. I meant refresh a channel (ctrl+f refresh):
That certainly requires a BTC transactions.


Not for the common man who just wants to buy a $50 bag of weed but doesn't have any BTC but wants to.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:32:08
Yes we do. Which was the whole point of this post.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:32:59
So much for BU being a Chinese takeover /s
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:01:12


Depends on adoption. I would certainly say it would help reduce the pressure of on chain transactions as their "might" be fewer, but It entirely depends on adoption (which I do believe will be quite significant, especially for non "illicit" transactions).


I don't really believe any of these to be honest, and I don't really think a bigger block would change this any more than today with a 1MB block. LN (and other L2) in conjunction with a dynamic block size (with segwit even) is my opinion of the best way forward.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:53:55
Yes please.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:04:59
They probably won't let you do that IMO - regulations and such.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:52:19
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:49:41
This reminds me about something I read a while back. Wasn't there an Etherium like alt-coin planned that started with the bitcoin ledger way back in the day? This kind of reminds me of that, but I can't remember the damn name.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:39:14
I'm starting to think so too. Maybe the compromise is how we get there?
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:17:35


I don't know one way or the other, but the thing about co-opting is you don't know, until it's too late.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:51:21
Yep exactly. Damn BU for being transparent with how they spend their funding. For shame!
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:08:50
Go figure...
I don't trust a word of what I read on this subreddit anymore. What a nightmare.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:30:03


Slush might want to have a word about that, if you are calling him Jihan. Regardless, I would like to see some evidence behind your claims, but I'm guessing I will just get down-voted and told that I'm stupid and need to open my eyes - it's OK.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:10:13
Ding ding.
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:53:34
I think flexible transactions is a better less complex solution. However, I will concede that it is not completely ready yet, and it is a hard fork, but should be fully evaluated for its merits by both sides of this debate before being adopted or cast away.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:33:26
Being that Bitcoin is a commodity (in the US) there are very limited  insider trading laws around these (commodity) markets.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:14:15
Too deep. We probably don't actually want this.
My gut says 160 or lower. We probably want to convince them some other way before then.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:57:51
I agree, but that's exactly it from my understanding over the years.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:49:47


I thought this was a list of companies that are prepared for segwit, not necessarily a list of companies that are pushing for segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:03:00
People can decide where to point their miners, unless I am missing something.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:33:24
I think this is a fantastic idea! Adam, please wield your influence for good. Open mod logs would do a lot to alleviate concerns.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:04:50


I'm still waiting on seeing that CVE that was submitted prior to the github commit.    
Nothing yet
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:31:12
Thank you! I appreciate your reply! I am off to the gym, but want to write a response when I get back.
It is posts like yours which truly help your "side", i'm happy to have received an honest reply.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:14:23
Yep, and that's why we have parallel validation.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:25:31
True, but that doesn't really give up your financial privacy. At least as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:45:15
The problem is it is extremely temporary and opens the door for lightning. If we do not have a dynamic block size increase when lightning is released it could certainly disallow the common man from opening lightning channels due to cost. Which means what happens when he wants to spend his coins (this should be obvious)?
If we don't have a solid plan to implement a dynamic block increase, I cannot support Segwit. At this point I don't trust core to deliver it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:22:20
Its sad too. Both sides want the same thing, we just disagree on how we get there.
Dynamic block size + malleability fix + lightning. We all want this from what I can tell. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:18:28
That is not how the two minutes hate works friend.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:44:13


What? All he said is that it is backed by AXA. Is he wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:26:43
Thanks. I certainly try to do my best :).
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:42:22
Well, if you don't want to spend 20, don't get it backed by SSD.
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:31:32
They can set a minimum fee today though.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:03:58
I want to understand. Could you explain in more detail how it centralizes the consensus?
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:34:34
Hrmm. That is an interesting proposal too. EC + SW would be OK to me. However I would also like to see FT fully evaluated too though.
Since it is Samson who brought it up, hopefully there might be some real discussion around doing something like this. I'm open to it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:20:55
Nah, you can stay there by yourself.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:29:17
I don't believe that. Blocks will grow, yes, but I believe an equilibrium will be found between L2 solutions (lightning among others) and block size. Even us big blockers want L2 solutions.
After all, if it is too expensive to open, update, and close lightning channels who will use lightning other than large banks who can pay to do so.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:32:55
Head, meet sand.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:01:07
Well, if there was a plan for after I would be pretty happy too.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:55:42


Then why the hell does BTCC not step into the party line.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:15:27
Well they could mine smaller blocks today if they would like (a setting available today), so my guess would be larger (seeing as most of their blocks are maxed), however, some would most likely still be empty just like today. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:37:31
EC is what is interesting in BU to me. However, I have been in support of a base block size increase since before SW code was available.
My irrational worry is that Core will never increase the base block size (hence limiting the ability to open LN channels to wealthy individuals or banks). Both Core and BU seem to act like semi-private organizations and that is also worrying to me.
If Roger Ver has influenced my opinion at all then he is one smooth criminal as I haven't even realized it.
Today, I would like to have both. BitcoinEC would have my support. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:25:42
Forget Roger Ver and forget BU. I intentionally left them off and only left the ideas here. Lets focus on the ideas and risks please, if possible
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:42:40
Yes, you can run a pruned node. But there will still be value in nodes that go back to the genesis block.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:15:09


You do realize that is practically an impossibility right?
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:45:22
Cool, thanks for the info and your insights, I do appreciate it.
I did however just want to set the record straight that he is not against L2 solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:11:55
So you want me to store my coins with a drug dealer? I don't think that would be the best idea.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:49:14
Removing harassing posts are one thing, straight up removing cordial opposing views is quite another.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:13:23
Why do Samson and BTCC not step into the party line then? I never understood that.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:07:43
Darn skippy!
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:34:32
Well, hopefully we don't have to wait a month. The bug is disclosed so the CVE should be released sooner than later hopefully. As you said, a mans reputation rides on it.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:28:53


I think the only way we can do that is to build the next big Reddit. a la another Digg migration away. While that would be great, I don't think it is entirely realistic, unfortunately. Thanks for posting your views, I personally appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:29:11
True. However if you cannot open, update, and close LN channels because the fee is too expensive to do so, what will the common man do?
I support SW, but we need a dynamic base block size implemented with it or at the very least before it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:44:29


Opening, closing, and updating LN channels requires an on chain transaction. This is what I am referring to.


I can't say for sure. Could be 10, to 50, to 500 or more (in USD).
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:52:22
I was specifically referring to the hard fork. This only acknowledges that it will be needed, but there is no real proposal for it unless you count Luke's. I feel like I have come full circle.
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:51:46
What do you mean tested? It was in use as the miners increased the soft block size cap until they hit the 1MB threshold, its got years of testing. EC is just a concept.
The only additional piece BU (and XT, and Classic) give you is a way for nodes and miners to announce the block size they want (EB), and to collaborate to determine the appropriate block size.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:36:39
Yep, this is very true.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:09:51
How do you link these back to an identity (any more so than before)?
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:14:33
Tell you what? Ah, I just realized your comment has been hidden for 7 hours and that's why it pinged me now. Oh well, guess it strikes both ways here ;) 
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:25:40
The crux of the matter to me is


Some of what you say could be possible without it IMO. If I can't personally open a lightning channel because it is overly cost prohibitive then we have a problem. The fear us big blockers have is that Core will not provide this necessary base block size change. You would be hard pressed to find anyone that disagrees with me (in our camp).
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:52:03
Could be. However I believe they think that the extra witness space in the blocks will cause friction eventually with standard transactions, increasing the cost to open LN channels in the end of the day if the base block is not increased as well.
I think they are also very skittish to follow Core since the HK agreement never yielded an acceptable block increase.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:24:56
It would have been a good compromise though, and now unfortunately here we are today.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:52:01
I don't disagree with that.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:41:18
What in my post do you disagree with specifically?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:44:12
Yep, and the only proposal to date is a 300K blocksize with an increase past 1MB in 2024. No code.
Core is also staunchly opposed to giving in and increasing the block size via a hard fork at this point. Or at least not without SW (still no proposal for even after SW though).
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:03:27
OK :(
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:43:11
Ah good. Are these ready to go today?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:05:46
Same liability as Wladimir van der Laan as the lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:46:27


Where would this channel be opened too (I missed this part of your conversation).
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:07:20
He can run his own implementation if he would like. EB to specify the block size he would like to create, wait for nodes and other miners to specify the same, then increase block-size if support is there.
Certainly no reason to run BU specifically. He can reference Classic or XT (and soon to be BitcoinEC) if he would like. None of these specify an AD either.
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:50:35
Whoa, we aren't even that reckless :)
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:32:15
Good, it would be irresponsible of them to not be ready for any outcome.

@_date: 2017-03-04 01:19:58
I understand. Please understand these are only my opinions and anyone else (including yourself) can freely look into the benefits and drawbacks of either or solution - the information is out there.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:00:26
I don't see how it makes further block increases safer then. If quadratic hashing is still a problem for legacy transactions, wouldn't an attacker (long verifying block) just simply not use segwit?
The only fix is to remove the old transaction type, which as you stated, is not possible without people losing money (nTimeLock).
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:25:24
That's fine. I just wanted to point out that we certainly aren't opposed to it, in fact we want it, even if we don't constantly rave about it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:34:30
Propaganda machine is chugging along.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:24:59
Well, I don't think they tried to, there was a bug in BU which produced a bigger block that was indeed rejected. I don't agree that it was intentional.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:41:16
Core has no plans to raise the base block size. Even if we implement SW and Schnorr we still have a locked block size as these two features are only one time block size increase, and pretty small too.
Without a base block size increase, fees will continue to increase. Unfortunately, at some point they very well could become cost prohibitive.
The currently proposed L2 solutions most certainly require fees to open channels, update channels, and close channels. If it is too cost prohibitive to open channels, we will need to rely on third parties to store our coins or at the very least transact on our behalf (such as a bank + website) as they will have well connected channels.
So the rbtc side is worried this is the path Core is taking us down and why we are demanding a block size increase before or at least with SW. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:47:42
I thought this was only for segwit transactions, not legacy transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:44:51


Source? I thought segwit corrected the problem of altering transaction IDs which the counterparty could potentially do to "lock your channel" until the time lock expired.
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:49:27
So what are you referring to? SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2? Those are some pretty serious allegations.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:42:10
A little off topic I'm just curious if you agree with me on this seeing as I have pegged as squarely on the "other side", but I do want to understand.
We both seem to agree that the base block size will need to increase at some point. We both also want LN and a malleability fix.
My only worry is that Core will implement SW, LN will come into existence but will be too expensive to open, update, and close channels for the normal person. Without a dynamic block size increase I could see a situation where we now use BofA to store our coins because they have a well connected LN node, and already have open channels to many places (because orgs like BofA can afford the fee).
Does this concern make sense to you?
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:22:09
Yeah, but that's not as much fun of a narrative as Jihan wanting blocks smaller so he can seize more power and control or something like that.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:03:29

@_date: 2017-03-14 20:44:53
You mean like blockstream employing core developers? Is that not considered receiving money?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:27:33
For the sake of this, lets assume I don't trust BU either, and I also don't trust Core.
I just want a re-united community - because I DO believe we all want the same thing in the end of the day, we just disagree on how to get there.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:45:50
Yep same here. Thanks for confirming ;)
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:13:12
Aside from who AXA is, they also have strong ties to the Bilder1berg group which is an annual private conference of 120 to 150 people of the European and North American political elite, experts from industry, finance, academia, and the media, established in 1954.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:58:39


What? It has been in existence since the beginning. Direct evidence was miners increasing the soft limit for years prior to hitting the 1MB ceiling. It is just a concept.
An adjustable block size cap client allows miners and nodes to come to a consensus around the preferred block size (EB) via coinbase and headers. Once enough nodes and miners are signaling for a larger block, someone will create one. This is also in use today, by Classic, XT, and BU. Seems to be working at EB=1 today, it's not even a proposal at this point. It is living and breathing.


It was always best practice to wait 6 blocks. However, with AD=9999 or infinity this point is also moot.
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:18:51
I found that funny too.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:27:07

@_date: 2017-03-14 14:18:22
I thought LND didn't necessarily require it. Is all development stopped on Lightning until SW is activated?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:02:40


That's where I actually disagree. I would rather just use cash at that point. BofA wont let me buy a gram of weed because they are required to know where the money goes. Thank you for taking the time, and hopefully I have provided some insight from the "big block" camp.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:17:01
Nothing would change though.

Yep. Gotta have your Emmanuel Goldstein.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:00:51

@_date: 2017-03-17 10:48:12
Well, the dynamic block size is on Core's roadmap as well (after SW, which I don't agree with), so whoever does not want it is a man without a country, at least on paper.   
I don't understand your inference about lightning. We most certainly want that, one side just sees an extreme risk of having it without a plan to scale the base block size.  
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:01:07
Sure have. Luke-jr's proposal for a hard fork is to reduce the block size to 300KB and increase by 17.7 percent per year until we finally pass the 1MB limit in 2024. This is the only "compromise" that I have seen.
Otherwise, I don't know. I have only seen the all or nothing mentality when it comes to SW (here anyways).
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:22:06


What option is this? It's not BU, because it does not remove the restriction completely, it makes it dynamic, to find an equilibrium between fee rate and block size. Unlimited was a piss poor name, because there is nothing that is "unlimited".
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:42:33


That's fantastic! Got a good laugh out of me, thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:29:29
So..is there any evidence this is correct? Like a released CVE with a timestamp prior to the commit?
Or are we just going to take an anonymous report as fact without any evidence?
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:11:56
Take a look at this, it's probably the best post to look at as far as getting some insight into what the exchanges think:

He has 15% of the network and owns no mining equipment himself. He operates a pool. He has no power.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:23:38


As it would be by specifying EB. If the majority of miners signaled 1MB EB then there you go and nodes, we would stay at 1MB as a larger block would fork the miner that created the block off.


Well, again, EC is currently "activated" it is a concept not a protocol change. If 15% of (miners?) cant handle the size, then I guess we will have larger blocks supported by 85% of the hashrate, the 15% chain would probably die off pretty quickly due to difficulty and confirmation time. It just is what it is, you either have to grow or get beaten by the competition.


How do you figure? xthin and compact blocks mitigate this risk to a large extent.


Sure they will, nodes and miners are signaling via EB. If  15% is signaling for EB=2, 80% for EB=4, and 1% for EB=500 you can be confident that a miner will probably want to stay on the chain with the users and miners, and would create a block no larger than 4MB (again, not taking into account AD as it is configurable and also non-existent in XT, Classic, and soon to be BitcoinEC)


It will take a long time for general consensus via EB to produce blocks too large to run a node. I have two nodes currently, very underutilized and have about 900GB of space left.
Also, miners could have created 1MB blocks this whole time if they wanted to, it wasn't until they hit the hard limit (after many, many years) that this debate really blew up (as the fees blow up).
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:49:49
Certainly might be, but at least we could probably get SW since the miners won't be threatened by having it without the potential to increase the base block size.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:16:13
That's a pretty snide comment, but it is what it is. Cheers @_date: 2017-03-30 18:40:58
Would be kind of cool actually (PoW minority altcoin hardfork). There have been a couple of alt coins that never really came to fruition that were going to be based on the existing bitcoin ledger. aetherium was one that I remember.
Quite the epic block chain to start an alt coin on and use bitcoin holders would already have some. It would also be the largest altcoin chain :).
May the best chain win :D

I don't really want to argue with you on this. There is obviously a lot of distrust on both sides.

True, it may be ready, but its not being adopted unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:54:44
There is none. It is segwit or nothing. I personally don't agree with that.

I can't just purchase funds (other than a few fixed income instruments) through my primary bank either, that's why I have a TDA account.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:47:23


All competition is not centralization. Sorry. Just because someone wants to mine blocks in Kenya does not mean we should ensure that we can support that, especially if it harms 100% of the network to do so.


Well, there are improvements in the pipeline, such as Segwit or Flexible Transactions, parallel validation, etc.


Do you have any evidence that &gt;1MB is too large to run behind TOR?
Blocks wont come out of the gate at 1TB, it took 8 years to hit 1MB.

@_date: 2017-03-14 22:03:28
Ok, well get on activating it. Apparently we are all waiting for it and doing absolutely nothing until SW is activated. Time is ticking.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:23:40
Well you just pinged him. Let's see what he says.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:54:07
CVE's are publicly searchable. You don't need to be a coder. 
CVE numbers are assigned immediately and in reserved status until the bug is either publicly released, or 30 days have passed. You bet your butt I will be making one hell of a stink if nothing shows up after 30 days (about ~15 days in so far IIRC).
Everything else you posted (and I mean everything) is pure conjecture at this point. I want some proof, that's it, nothing more, nothing less. At this point to me it just looks like a smear campaign without any proof whatsoever. Shouldn't have even been reported without a shred of evidence that anything was legitimate.
Guess we will just wait and see. I know I will be (and by all means, feel free to throw it in my face if I am wrong).
So what were we saying about Goldstein again?
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:20:25
Heh, the convenience of driving 50 miles away. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:21:27
I personally don't. I think SW is an old solution to problems that have been solved by other mechanisms in a more elegant way. I was just leaving my comment open in case there was definitive proof that I was wrong (and there was a loose plan to implement SW somewhere).
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:17:20
Ah, well if you don't have room you don't have room.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:26:52


Like.. is there any evidence this is not a fabrication (the article)? We have an anonymous report that something happened prior, but zero evidence aside from this article.
Where is the CVE? It can be released now that the vuln is known, I would feel better that this isn't a smear campaign and would prove the accuracy of this article (depending on the timestamp, of course).
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:06:17
Well we could at least try right?
The answer to your question is of course, but we aren't even doing that. Regardless of how stupid it would be for a "professional investor" to get his research here.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:52:53
Users can set their AD to 99999 if they want to run BU. This takes any additional power away from BU miners.
Also, you can always run Classic, XT, or (soon to be) BitcoinEC which also do not support AD.
- Core: miners and nodes coordinate to mod their Core code to increase the cap to 2MB
- [ABC clients]( miners and nodes coordinate to adjust their client settings to increase the cap to 2MB
Not seeing where the shift of power is happening.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:25:03
Did he say that he didn't deny it or has he just said nothing? 
I also don't understand why they went to Roger, he is not involved in the development of xthin. 
E: if he did say something, then your perspective would be proven. If I can see a CVE, your perspective would be proven. All I have is Aaron's and your word so far, and from what I have seen, Aaron has been very biased and one sided.
I would prefer to be proven wrong, but words and reputations mean very little to me these days. Provable facts speak truth.

@_date: 2017-03-16 05:17:50
That CVE that was submitted prior to the github commit would be awesome evidence. It no longer needs to be hidden and I would be a happy camper to be proven wrong. Forgive me if I don't take Aaron at his word. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:54:15
Core nodes dropped too, just FYI. At least according to coin.dance. There is funny business abound.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:45:41


Nope, only for segwit transactions which are opt-in. An attacker would just simply use a normal transaction.


I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding about what BU actually does. It is confusing based solely off of the name. We do not want unlimited blocks.
BU is evaluating Flexible Transactions as a quadratic hashing fix as well as a malleability fix (for all transactions). It also just merged parallel validation which negates the impact of a long validating block.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:41:05

I know. I certainly didn't mean to imply that. By dynamic block size I am referring to something like EC, or what is on the core roadmap for after SW (which I'm considering the malleability fix in in my OP).
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:22:58

@_date: 2017-03-04 16:27:51
You don't need to validate a block with no transactions. It does add a block to the chain which increases the security of all previous confirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:47:53

Relative to BTC which has been on a tear sure. Relative to FIAT it is at ATH.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:26:25
Why does it have to be one or the other though? Why is our only option LN + SW with a 1MB base block size instead of a dynamic block size  +  SW(or FT) + LN?
We both want L2. The biggest risk is that I won't personally be able to open payment channels without paying huge fees to do so, or using a bank (who can censor my transactions) to store my bitcoin and use their L2 channels. I believe an equilibrium will be found between L2 transactions, block size, and on chain transactions (including opening payment channels, updating them, and closing them). 
I think BU is the right step in that direction, however, I would personally also support a one time block size increase and SW (or FT) at the same time.
e: You know what, I want to expand on this:    


I only say this because I think it would grease the wheels of future increases. I really do think a dynamic block size needs to be implemented (whether that is EC or something better).
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:30:19

Oh no, BU has had two critical bugs:    
    
(that last one is interesting too, still unreleased, so how do we know it is fixed)
How about we all quit being asshats and find out how to implement a dynamic base block size so we can end this shitty debate. Both sides want this, so lets try to compromise on this point.

Well, we are assuming USD50, do you think coinbase will open a channel to you for $500? Or do you think they would ask you to use one of their partners? How about localbitcoins, is that dead then?

I can guarantee they won't do that. Not before the base block size is increased and Flexible Transactions is ruled out entirely as a malleability fix.

They didn't refuse anything, they just did not directly help development of the protocol in a way that we know of, or at all. I never remember seeing anything that stated that they had no intention of ever helping.
I would almost say they they most certainly did help the bitcoin project by providing a valuable service.

There is no way to determine the exact network speed. It is calculated from blocks generated, so if we get 7 in 10 minutes, it will inflate the calculations. When I wake up tomorrow and we are trending at 42B/h then I will be worried. This does not appear to be the case though.

I don't see a problem. There are tiny transactions in there filling the whitespace in the blocks. If somebody wants to send tiny transactions with a tiny fee, I don't see any problem with that. It's just going to take longer for their transactions to confirm, but whomever is sending is already aware of that (just trying to induce panic).
I'm not saying it's not a good idea to increase the block size, but expect the same thing to happen with 10MB blocks as well (this is going to be a normal thing).
