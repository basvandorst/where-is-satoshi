"Trust as a service" is a well established way of doing it. All central banks are doing it.  Financial institutions too and also your pension fund. Hmmm... why did Satoshi even invent Bitcoin in the first place, when trust can so easily be outsourced? Yea let's go back to the old way of doing things, package it with Bitcoin like tech and let's call it something really cool... like superledger or hyperledger. The only thing I _don't_ understand about hyperledger, is why they are even talking with the crypto community.

Indeed Tim sees an opportunity to make money, selling a product. In my opinion just that simple. If he can downplay the importance of Bitcoin and promote his own product, he will. Question is why people are feeding him attention in podcasts etc. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:35:39
Perhaps no-one knows? My thinking goes like this though... money today is basically government debt. Bitcoins are like the opposite to debt. I don't see government abandoning the use of debt. Therefor I don't see them switching to using Bitcoin. I do however see people rejecting government debt. Which implies they have to sell their debt (treasuries etc) and transfer their purchasing power to something else. Since the government will have less debt purchased, they will have to increase tax. That means people will have to convert into something that can not be taxed. Housing can be taxed. Equities too. Gold is being tracked and also you can not take it across borders. In this kind of environment people are going to panic buy bitcoins. The state is therefor going to crack down on bitcoins, but if more and more of the economy is resting on the use of it, they will attack bitcoins _financially_ and not technically. That implies printing money, buying bitcoins and managing the price. The end game, if Bitcoin doesn't fail, is sovereign nations launching their own mining operations to prevent other nations of subverting the network. A likely outcome is also some sort of Proof-of-Stake based government network running in parallel to Bitcoin.  Yea... that's my guessing :D

I remember when people were saying that something like Bitcoin wouldn't work either. Actually very few were mining it in the beginning and crypto anarchists had many arguments as to why it wouldn't work. I see the same thing happening with Proof-of-stake.
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:27:59
If price goes up, you are likely to think you did the right thing and possibly even make that an argument to putting the money at work in something else highly risky. Sometimes being right can be more dangerous then being wrong. If I were you I would not buy more bitcoins, not even if price starts to go up and you start making money on what you've already invested.

Yes you are correct. Since its difficult to ascertain with 100% when the coin supply is dispersed wide enough, check-pointing is not something that should be removed "just like that". Better to have some margin of error, right? Hence, that's why its still there. The day it is removed, price might sky rocket because suddenly we have a proof that everyone will understand, but then it will be to late to buy. Better buy some now.

I'm thinking like, if Apple Pay enters the scene, then what about PayPal and what about all other that want to take a bite from the pay pie? Maybe of these sharks will push Bitcoin as a way to differentiate from Apple Pay and maybe the cost/efficiency of Bitcoin could also play a big part of it. Actually, what I think is that Bitcoin (and Peercoin, since I'm one of "those Peercoin advocates") will act as _the_ store of value and payment processing will then be done on systems like Open Transactions. Something like that.

Good point, Peercoin is a hybrid. A key issue with Proof-of-Stake is coin distribution. Peercoin use Proof-of-Work to ensure that coins get distributed more widely, had it had all the coins pre-generated. For ensuring the integrity of the blockchain, Peercoin relies solely on Proof-of-Stake.

The infrastructure is being built out. People like me are shortselling Bitcoins in order to get more money to buy more once price turns into bullmarket. Don't be fooled by euphoric people in a bullmarket and don't be fooled by traders in a bear  market.

I think that Wallstreet will create derivatives and then sell the derivatives to its clients. It will be all kinds of derivatives and will be much more profitable to trade with. These will then be used for trading activities and create a paper market that is bigger then the bitcoins market.
In the mean time banks will slowly suck up coins from the market, so that when the time comes, they will be able to control the price by market operations by spamming cheap coins to suppress the demand and push it up when they want to create upside risk.
I'm not sure that volatility will ever go away if gov. decides it want it to stay volatile. Hence fiat money, will stay a reserve currency and bitcoins will just be another commodity.
I'm not sure they will succeed, but I bet they will try. The interesting thing starts to happen when other countries decides to raise up to the challenge and call their "bluff".

Yes they are myths. The check-point is not a myth however and I fully understand if this is a no-no for you. The only reason I'm putting up with it, is because I take a longer time outlook and are afraid that I will not be able to buy peercoins as cheap as they are today.

I've not done an in depth study, so I don't have any historical points of reference. But one thing is for sure, if the price tanks, arbitrage will equalize volatility across exchanges. What I mean is, it would be difficult to rinse and repeat huge sell order on many different exchanges. If you do it all at once, yes then at least the market orders would probably go through.
So what you must do is to check the order books of all the major exchanges that you can see yourself using. Then check how big the spread would be. That way you can get some idea of how much coins can be bought and sold, for what spread.
Now, the important thing here is to time the market. When price is going down, liquidity will evaporate. What you want to do is to liquidate a lot of coins when price is going up, because then there is the most liquidity and the least spread. Market orders in this type of environment can certainly work.
What I'm getting at here is that it is not enough to check the order book, you will also have to take the market conditions into account.
If you're not sure of how to make sense of the market conditions, then just ask me for help. Though I don't have a crystal ball, I'm pretty lucky.
EDIT: I just re-read the last comment you made about your fears of Venezuela at the edge of bankruptcy. So, if people in Venezuela would start buying bitcoins like mad right now, I think the price would sky rocket. Traders would see this as an opportunity to take advantage of leveraged short positions, that would run the risk of being forced liquidated by sky rocketing prices. The market in general would take notice and start buying to. In current market conditions, this would mark the end of a long bear market and the price having bottomed out. As the price rises, the spread wouldn't be to bad, because the rising price would compensate for this. Now, if you have bought tons and tons of bitcoins and want to cash out, this would be an excellent time to do so, because of the strong bid in the market. Well... if you're Satoshi or have an equivalent amount of coins, you would still have to be _very_ gentle (just the fact that Satoshis coins are "tainted" in the sense that everyone knows its his, would scare people as soon as the tx hits the wire. Satoshi would have to sell his coins at localbitcoins to avoid this (yes its a bad joke) ). If you're selling enough, you would have to do it gradually over time and probably sell into strength. 
EDIT 2: If you are the only Venezuelas buying like crazy, but no-one else, then yes you would run into some problems. Probably what I would do is to distribute the money and buying also things like NuBits ( peercoins, litecoins and of course buy bitcoins and use Coinapult to lock some value to dollars, silver and what not. That way you would be pretty diversified.  Now, if the market start tanking real hard, the money you've got in peercoins would drop as well, along with bitcoins. So, what you can do is to open up accounts at one or more of those risky exchanges and short the price of bitcoins and peercoins etc. Should the price drop hard, this hedge will protect you a little - especially if its a leveraged trade. The good thing about leverage, is that while your exposure to volatility _increases_ your exposure to  exchange default risk (which historically speaking is very high) _decreases_. What I would do is to take these kinds of different positions, to distribute risk all over the ecosystem. That way you would be protected somewhat from the spread. You would have to seriously know what you were doing though, because the odds is that this kind of strategy would blow up in your face. Then again, maybe you're the kind of person that could pull it off?!

_Peercoin_ was the first coin to introduce Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Proof-of-Stake replace Proof-of-Work and because of how it works, its more energy efficient and more environmentally friendly. I believe in Peercoin because I think there are inherent issues with Proof-of-Work which has to do with mining centralization and economic issues related to the fee structure. Bitcoin have tons of really good developers working on it and has the network effect going for it, so I also hold bitcoins as a speculative investment,  
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:48:04
I sold some coins at $900 which I had bought below $15. Now I'm shortselling bitcoins until trend changes. It's just a game of price playing on people's emotions. The technology will be here for a long time. No worries. That people are depressed now means nothing. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:05:57
I think Proof-of-Stake as implemented in Peercoin (there are so many versions of PoS that it's worth pointing it out) is really interesting. The paper linked to here actually does very little to convince me that PoS has nothing to offer. But hey, I guess many people have thought the same thing about Bitcoin, that it would "never work" and for sure it took some time before it caught on even among the more crypto savvy ones. One thing that I'm missing in the paper, is an argument surrounding the economic incentive models built into Pos and how it relates to PoW. In PoW there is an incentive to centralize mining, which could spell some trouble. When issues such as these begin to manifest, then PoS based coins could go through a renaissance. For sure all what is going on here is research and experimentation. We simply don't know for sure how things will pan out. Discounting PoS now, I think it way to early. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:15:57

@_date: 2014-06-13 16:21:31
But in case there is a duplicate-block, only the first one is used by the network, to the other block will not be used. Since its not used it has no impact. The coin age on the main chain is consumed however, so if someone does this meaningless thing, they can't bloat forever because the coin age is consumed.

I second that and here we have another piece of history: 
This is the future of tx verification: 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:58:55
Minting requires many nodes. If only one node is minting, it works but is centralized. Same with Bitcoin, only one mining works, but many is required for it to be decentralized. Right now, people cluster in pools because it makes economic sense. Economic sense centralizes Bitcoin. That's just a fact. Otherwise we wouldn't have cloudhashing etc. Peercoin is the opposite. The more nodes, the more decentralized network and there is no incentive to pool, because of minting.

Wow, this is totally awesome. Half a year ago I was looking for something like this. I had this idea of creating an offline hard wallet and then an Android app that would interface with internet. Private key would reside on the hardware wallet, which would do signing and stuff and then the Android client would broadcast the TX on the internet.
My vision was that all the development should be done open source and the proof of concept on Raspberry Pi. Then industrial designers would help designing this really nice cool bracelet  (or other wearable things that would both look nice and easy to carry with) that would target high-net individuals. In time ordinary people would also be able to afford it, when production lines were created, etc. 
Yea this is awesome!!!!

Why not buy the coins cheaply before check-pointing is removed and everyone sees that it actually works really well. Say you own 2 bitcoins. Why not use 1% of that and buy peercoins. If the network works when the check-pointing is removed, the price could potentially go up a whole lot. It makes great sense, at least as a bet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:04:00
Coin age decreases on main as you mint and the network only propagates first block you send. You have to have a lot of coin age and luck to do this for a longer period of time and if you do, you also have a lot of stake because the coins you successfully mint with you will not be able to use to sell because they will be locked. When you mint, you basically go long peercoins and prey that the PPCUSD don't take a nose dive, because you will not be able to sell. That's what 's all about; you have a stake.

Well, we will see how things play out. I own more bitcoins then peercoins in terms of USD, so I honestly hope that you are right. But then again, Maxwell is correct about a naive implementation of PoS and my bet is that the protection built into Peercoin against this type of problems works. If my bet fails, I still own more bitcoins, if Peercoin comes out a winner - then I'll just might become very, very rich. That is the kind of bet I'm making.

@_date: 2014-06-11 14:58:04
You are correct. Check-pointing centralizes as it is implemented today centralizes the network. However, one day it will be removed and when that happens everyone will be able to see that it works anyway and then the energy efficient features of the coins (among other things) could make it very, very, profitable to hold. Buying now when its cheap is a smart move. Tip, while there are less and less Bitcoin nodes, the number of nodes in the Peercoin network just increases. Skip forward a few months and you get the picture.

I think you are spot on in all of you comments. Please note, I'm not bashing Andreas. Andreas also said that Bitcoin was the only coin that would prevail because of the network effect. Lately he has attended Doge conferences and admits that he was wrong. Andreas is a great guy because he can admit when he his wrong. I'm not bashing him for being wrong, I'm applauding him for being able to change his mind even though he is a public figure.

There are many myths related to Proof-of-Stake. Some of the myths are totally unfounded and some types of attacks can successfully be mitigated. This is a list of the most common for Peercoin: 
In my opinion Proof-of-Stake is not the ultimate solution and neither is Proof-of-Work (because it leads to centralization see hashlets etc, and central points of failure, a long with rising costs for maintaining the network). Then again, until we get a better solution, Proof-of-Stake is probably the best one I can think of. Just my personal opinion of course.
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:15:32
I got the lost word.
@_date: 2014-10-26 17:34:59
Don't worry. Bitcoin sidechains might make some Proof-of-Work coins superfluous, but Proof-of-Stake coins such as Peercoin will still be around. Actually those might even get some more market share, since they potentially will compete with less PoW coins. Who knows. For sure, people holding Peercoin will not sell it because of Bitcoin sidechains.
EDIT: I would be more wary of holding PoW coins that only has quicker confirmation time, anonymity and stuff like that. Those for sure is in the cross-hair. Peercoin "competes" with not using PoW, so it's different case.
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:55:49
Point well taken. Last time there was talk about mining centralization I looked around and discovered that the inventors of Peercoin had already thought about this issue with Bitcoin. I now I will be down voted for sharing this and that's all right. The most disturbing thing is that some people don't even consider GHash.IO having that much hashing power even a problem. I own more bitcoins worth then peercoins, so please people use a p2pool. Please.

I think I remember the creator of Peercoin saying something along the lines of PoW not playing a security role in Peercoin. I'm looking at this code ( and see that they're using a kernel in the mechanism evaluating whether stake can be created or not. I don't see where it is using PoW to select which stake can mine. I'm by no means an expert, merely a grasshopper trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. If you see something in the code that makes use of PoW to select which block can mine, I'm eager to know what this is.

Honestly yes. I expected it to be much much, much, very much bigger then  what it is today. My timings totally off though. I didn't expect things to happen so fast. I still think this is only the beginning. Because cryptos is lowering the cost of transactions for all kinds of stuff, as long as it can be tied to a token (money, shares, contracts, etc.) legacy banking, stock exchanges etc, all those industries can be disrupted. We're talking about extremely super huge change here. The only limitation really is how much Bitcoin blockchain can scale. Enter side chains, tree chains, federated-servers voting pools (Open Transactions) and so forth and so on. Yea, this is only beginning.

I'm not sure of the proper definition of mainstream. I kind of think that Bitpay is mainstream now. Bitcoin is still not mainstream enough for merchants to consider holding on to the coins. They it's because of the volatility. So which will happen first: wallstreet or volatility ending? My bet is on wallstreet.

Peercoin use Proof-of-Stake which requires that there are many nodes "minting" (similar to mining). There are not yet enough nodes on the network. Bitcoin started off very decentralized but becomes centralized over time, Peercoin is the opposite. It started rather centralized and with time will become totally decentralized.

What scares me the most, is if a hacker, hacking into the pool taking control over it - does some bad things and profit from the price fall by shorting btcusd before the attack.

You can't "pretend" to be a node in the Peeroin network. Either you are a node or you are not. Only way to mint is to be invested. Peercoin will not need check-pointing because it is using Proof-of-Stake. P2Pool does not offer cloudhashing and is less economical to use.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:03:40
There are protections against people creating an endless number of parallel chains. When it comes to proof that the coins is dispersed widely enough, that's a tricky one. I'm not sure what the best way is to do that. The first step would be to see how many minting nodes we have. A really stupid thing would be to remove it without having a margin of safety. The proof that everyone understands, is that it works and nobody is able to attack it. If the coin fail after all, I will loose the money I've invested in it. That is why I've not 100% invested in it. Same thing with Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes even more centralized, the risk of that investment going bad increases, that's why I'm not 100% invested in Bitcoin and have a stake in Peercoin instead. All investing comes down to one thing: taking a risk. What is smart to do, is to take a little risk when the reward is many times the risk and the odds of you winning is asymmetric to the risk-reward ratio. It's such a time right now. However, I can't blame you for not investing in Peercoin. If I thought about it like you do, I wouldn't either. But my understanding is different from yours, so I'm willing to take on the risk. Time will tell if it was a good bet or not.
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:33:58
"Sunny King: The checkpoints is there for temporary protection. It can be removed right now, but unlike some of our competitors who don't quite care about security, I take it very seriously. Last time I mentioned that even though proof-of-stake security is getting stronger during last year" (
Its just a question about time. When check-points are removed and if the network can handle it, price could skyrocket. As a trader I buy into the fear other people have now and when its a non-issue and people see that, I profit. If I'm wrong I loose of course.

A lot of money is being invested into this "mining ASIC". To me it sounds like a better investment then buying harddisks for the blockchain. Also bitcoins are mined with miners. Blockchain... No point to it. Enough if only amazon or google has the database. My high sallary let me say these smart things which are then quoted.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:29:40
I disagree. If you try to mint at several chains, the main thread will consume coin age, so you can't do this forever. Until the coin age is consumed, you could try your best to mint on several chains, but the network will only use the first block. With PoW you often have special purpose built ASIC that quickly becomes obsolete, hence there is no incentive for one to be friendly to the network if you sell the bitcoins as soon as you get them. Since there is no "stake" in the network if you don't keep the bitcoins, you don't have to care. You could just point your ASIC to another coin. Then we have the people who keep their bitcoins but are never the less mining on GHash.IO - why on earth do that? That can possibly be explained by the tragedy of the commons:  Please understand that I'm not here to prove a point. I used to loath Peercoin and was arguing against it, until the day I actually did my homework, looked it up and learned that the myths were myths. Then I decided to take a small portion of my bitcoins and bought peercoins. I still own more bitcoins valued in USD then peercoins. Bitcoin has the network effect and everything that comes a long with it. I'm not against Bitcoin, but I'm not against Peercoin either.

So someone who is a gold bug and have a stake in a centralized system, think that it is superior. Isn't this the type of guy that usually say things like "if you don't hold it, you don't own it!" not only is it re-introducing counter party risk, it also introduce volatility.

You are correct. check-pointing creates centralization. However, that are only applied during bootstrapping phase. Check-pointing is not a myth, but the other myths are myths. Check-pointing is not used because of these myths, it has to do with coin dispersion.

What would happen if coinbase was shutdown or attacked?  Would stable prices and low volatility follow? Central points of failure are just that and increases the risk. Marked-based centralization is a concept I don't buy into. Centralization is centralization what ever the reason. Instead of complacent redefinition let's make these central points of failure less important to the overall network. Putting all mining machines in the same building isn't it, because it can be compromised by armed forces. Hacking is so 2014.

Check-pointing is there to ensure bootstrapping of network. Work is being done to remove it such as but not limited to  
PoW has a trajectory towards more centralization (pools, cloud-hasing, contracts, etc). PoS is going towards decentralization (energy efficient minting). This means that one day Bitcoin will be very centralized and Peercoin extremely decentralized.

A lot of miners have been mining alt coins and dumping them for bitcoins. Unfortunately it doesn't contribute to the security of the Bitcoin network, but it does put bitcoins in the hands of those who can not afford to mine bitcoins. It also puts some "shit coins" in the hands of some poor souls who basically gets scammed into owning those pump n dump coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:11:53
When Bitcoin was born, nobody believed in it. Not even those that really knew their stuff, had no faith in it. My point is that S.N. didn't have to premine it, because basically no-one else cared about mining it (EDIT: I'm not saying he planned that either ;)). Also the source code was broken and people could create more coin then what was intended and stuff like that. The devs that have fixed all of these issues, deserves way more credit when what they get.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:15:11
I guess I'm the minority here, but I believe that decentralized systems are very good. If there are a few alt coins along with Bitcoin, that creates a climate of healthy competition and so forth and so on. It's no way to get around the fact that most coins have a few mega bag holders and distributing this power instead of concentrating it is probably a good thing I think. I mainly hold bitcoins and peercoins. Bitcoin have the developers and the network effect and Peercoin a different way of securing the blockchain, should Proof-of-Work manifest some weakness such as centralization. I don't have a problem with people owning other alt coins. Some coins are obvious pump n dumps and I stay away from those. Enough is enough of them but I don't think they will ever go away. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-06-12 05:28:28

This is a good thing because Cloud mining is really bad of Bitcoin. Funny thing though, price of peercoins have fallen dramatically together with Bitcoin but contrary to Bitcoin the difficulty has gone up. Guess the cost of verifying Bitcoin outweighs the reward because of PoW, while Peercoin using Proof-of-Stake can be secured by cheap Raspberty Pi.

I've noticed another thing. Several times the btcusd price have been trending down, been ready to snap and then when enough shorts have been built up, big money have bought massive amount of coins. The technical chart has been "we're going down" but massive buying have taken advantage of that. My take away from this is, if you're shorting, be quick to cover your shorts. Then again, I'm biased, because I think the price has reached a bottom and is heading higher from here.

Ive been reading zerohedge off and on for a long period of time. It's emotional and oftentimes uneducated. Sure they have a point and are good at pointing out some serious issues, but when you talk to people who actually work with these things, they can give a much more detailed picture of why this and that is happening and what is at stake. Zerohedge is more like "its going to blow up... so buy gold... and blow up... total failure...". They have been telling people to buy gold since the peak a few years ago. Hello, anyone home?! Sure, I trade gold and silver mining stocks and see what they are getting at, but its just to much of scare mongering.

While slowly gaining recognition, I think the power elite is still not really getting it. I think they have so much on their plate, that an obscure internet phenomena is not really getting the attention from the right (wrong) people. But when price skyrockets and _everyone_ starts talking about it... along with enough academics/economists writing enough papers about the implication of Bitcoin... well of course 5K-10K is just something I pulled out of my ear, but case in point a high valuation will kind of force their hand and they will have to do something about it to address tax-issues and so forth and so on. Eventually they will have to try and kill it, and then might be used as a weapon by other entities. If USA goes like "developing Bitcoin protocol is now a terrorist crime and you will be shot" then Russa might go: "we support Bitcoin development (but not the dollar) so please come and work here and we will protect you from USA". And maybe Island goes like: "we have a state financed mining pool which is tax exempt, so point your miners at our pool" and then Island will make sure all Islandic originating (and miners mining with their pool) transactions will be included in the latest block (even paying zero fee, as long as its islandic originating) and well... suddenly USA might see the world move ahead and they kind of will have to join in (similar to if Russia gets more nuclear weapons, USA will have too.... well not similar, but hope I get my point across).
@_date: 2016-11-04 20:43:24
You're not going to find any well balanced info on this. You're just not going to. That said, here is my take on it: With PoW you get indisputable evidence which blockchain has the most work spent on it and this is used to select which blockchain to select as _The blockchain_. With PoS you're never probably never going to get that kind indisputable evidence, because no work is being spent on it. Instead the network comes to consensus when those with a stake in the network (those that hold coins and stake them) agrees on what is the _The blockchain_. Some people argue that PoS can be attacked basically for free (costless simulation etc) but when new attack vectors are known, protection against them can be created. As for an example, checkpointing can be used to protect against some of these attacks. A "purist" might argue that checkpointing is a centralized mechanism, while someone else might argue that it is really not, because user can opt-out of it. No matter what camp you're in, one thing is arguably true: PoS is a more complex solution, compared to PoW and complexity is a bad thing (because its harder to understand, you can not be as sure that you know of all the attack vectors and weaknesses). However, the PoS based network is arguably cheaper to run then PoW and hence transactions should cost less then in a PoW based network. Then again with the advent of Lightning network, it yet again changes the picture. And then of course we have PoW/PoS hybrid systems that complicates tings even further. Which is the best now? And then there are Open Transaction that introduces voting pools, where consensus is also distributed among many trusted parties. I mean... basically its impossible to know for sure how all of this will play out, but I believe that one thing that matters more then all of what I mentioned above, is: the network effect. Bitcoin has the network effect in spades and even if there is something better out there, I'm not sure it will be able to outcompete Bitcoin in the short run. In the long run we're all dead anyway.

It's a good question and the answer is, yes you can, but maybe not in the way you usually do it in a db. Size is restricted, there is a cost and you can not be 100% sure that the data will stick when you want it to. Edit: as fit using the blockchain as a server, that doesn't compute. It like saying, can I use an email as email provider. You can build a server that communicates with apps (clients) via the blockchain though.

With mining gear you can instantly switch to mining another coin. With Peercoin you're locked into securing that coin. Look up cold Minting for keeping keys safe and check out Peerbox. There are no Minting pools in Peercoin that I'm aware of. Other PoS coins might suffer from that though. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 11:09:08
Peercoin has cold Minting on its roadmap. With cold Minting stealing the key will not be likely. Armed forces physically breaking into centralized mining farms will be possible also in the future. 
EDIT: I should note that in against Bitcoin switching to PoS. Bitcoin works well right now with PoW so why introduce uncertainty. If people want PoS we already have Peercoin and some other Peercoin forks and what not. Let them take the risk proving the viability first.

We already have Nubits, stellar and so forth and so on. Yet another USD pegged crypto would only serve to further the cause of Bitcoin because then more people would be prepared and educated in crypto.

I stand corrected. Is clear that also the news about the fork some year ago and also silk road shutdown affected price in a clear way.

Yes I think they if anyone knows how inefficient the markets are and what will happen if Bitcoin tech gets going. Basically the stock exchanges will go away and die. Because of regulations another type of stock exchange will emerge but will function differently and serve another need so to speak. Once stocks are tracked on blockchains trading can be decentralised and trustless and no technical need for Nasdaq any longer. Either you buy into this tech now or you go away. In my not so humble opinion this is already a fact - reality just had to catch on. 
EDIT: just think about it. No more kickstarter,  no stock exchanges, no more mtgox etc. Ask that will go away. Instead we will have automic transactions in decentralized markets. It's likely that even your car (ownership of the car) will be traded like that. Basically the legacy financial world we have now will be have to change.

Please know that Bitcoin comes with its own risks and opportunities. Look into how to store your bitcoins safely. Generally avoid online wallets and keeping coins on exchanges. Look into hard ware wallets such as Ledger. Understand that bitcoins are volatile,. Price could go down 30% tomorrow. Perhaps look into ways of looking your coins in at a value pegged to USD? Not for all of the coins, but perhaps 15% of them? Stay away from alt coins. And good luck. I should add I own alt coins (mainly peercoin) and have not tried Ledger wallet myself. I wouldn't know about Exchanges. Maybe local bitcoins? Kind of difficult to send money overseas for you right now,  right? 
@_date: 2015-07-18 17:16:43
When I trade fx I switch between long and short all of the time, how could that be that you trade with the broker most of the time? Maybe most 50% of the time of short and long positions are as many.

Yes it's possible. Everything that can be tagged in this world could be tagged using tokens in the blockchain. The blockchain would then be parsed for this tags. Probably not so efficient but there can be other benefits. Checkout namecoin and coloured coins for more ideas.

HFT is often about taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities and moving enough stocks to get fee discounts, so that money can be made even on small changes in price. The stock market is a network of connected stock exchanges etc. Nowadays this is all existing in the realm of highly regulated, centralized operations. In the future I'm confident that stocks will be tokenized either ontop of existing blockading such as counterparty on Bitcoin or on separate blockchains using technologies such as Peershares (because its just so much more powerful.  the question: "why would a company that is making money on inefficient stock markets invest in the next gen stock market? " my guess would be that they are fully aware of what is about to happen. What is the difference between a stock IPO, VC investing in a startup and say Kickstarta? Save for the juridical differences there is a lot of differences, but that's about to change as social communities and Bitcoin tech is about to merge. There are already several examples: Nubits, Etherium, Counterparty that is giving a glimpse of what is about to happen. This Bitcoin stuff doesn't ask for permission and the killer app is the many ways in which it will creep into every aspect of our lives. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:44:23
Contrary to what many people think, news does not drive price. If the new is good, maybe it wasn't good enough? If the new was bad, maybe it was already priced into the market? No... What drives price is the major trend!!! Any divergence from the mean is speculation pushing price. But dips sell rallies and scalp some pips. Or buy N hold. It's as simple as that.
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:51:31
I think it had more to do with technical teasing levels then anything else. New doesn't drive price in the way people think. How can I be so sure? Well I predicted the bear tend would end one day in advance with the low of 166 (my guess was 190 with some slippage). I predicted consolidation for extended period ending 7 June (which happend) I predicted the rise to 320 bask down to these low levels and I also predict that price won't go let then 250 and is likely to bounce up next week and revisit 350. I predict that the market will end this year with price above 400 and a severe market crash end of September. This is likely to coincide with major volatility in legacy markets come October and flight to USD. Issues in us bond market will then create an outflow to private markets and tangible non governmental assets such as gold, silver, art and physical cash. Housing market will be subdued because of raising taxes. Third party risk will rise along with volatile stock markets and bitcoins will be assert itself as the new gold standard of the digital world. With this backdrop price will be heading for 1000 break the resistance and quickly bubble up to 10 000 dollar's. The whole world are going to get the Bitcoin fever and we will see price targets north of 100 000 because bitcoins will be viewed as the only market able to easily circumvent capital controls. The market will be much more liquid and local Bitcoin Exchanges are going to pop up everywhere. AltCoins like Peercoin offering an option like pay on bitcoins are going to pay catch up with early bitcoins enthusiasts and traders pumping in their new riches into these penny stock like alternatives. Governments are going to promote AstroTurf Blochains and start cracking down on Bitcoin promoting their crapcoins as viable and more "safe" options. Decentralised markets will be smarter and Bitcoin is likely to come out as the gold standard. By then 13-year old will be using this like the lighting network and have started traded virtual commodities in virtual worlds, where swords and characters can be moved between games. This will coincide with an explosion in smart phone leveraged world where system D will be in the forefront of the new economy leaving the old legacy institutions behind. Fortunes will be made and lost. People owning coins now will have sold to early. Early Bitcoin people will say things are same same but different. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:23:11
What if the fee was destroyed and the coins removed from the supply instead and also the free was high enough to mitigate spam. Then we would have a settlement network with a very small blockchain and attacks of this kind would increase the price of the coin all else being equal. This is how Peercoin works. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 04:08:29
The good points are? 
@_date: 2015-07-06 10:41:29
I mean I could be wrong, I don't have a crystal ball or anything but I think price will go to $10 000 before we see $166 again. Actually I've been saying that since this winter,   anticipating the low one day before it happened and then predicted the consolidation we've had since then. Price is perry predictable and people are too. For instance, the chance of you not calling this BS is about 1 in hundred. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:18:36
I can see why you are struggling with that. I would too. Sometimes I get the feeling "they" don't understand what Bitcoin is and therefor presumes is just a platform or a new type of database that you can install. While it's true in a way is not those features that make it add so special.

open transaction. also in open transaction you dont even have a blockchain, so no hard disk requirements needed "at all". voting pools are used. bitcoins could be traded in open transaction, reducing blockchain "bloat".
EDIT: Down voted? Makes no sense. To begin with OT is not a coin, secondly OT would enable less centralized crypto currency exchanges and so forth and so on. There is no competition between OT and Bitcoin, on the contrary they would strengthen each other. Also what I wrote is true, so why down vote?

I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that UBS fork Ripple, Peercoin or some other none-mining intense protocol. Perhaps they even develope their own. One thing is for sure, what ever they do it will be a system where they have control over the key features that makes Bitcoin a currency by and for the people. ubs will create something where unit of account can be changed, where the blockchain can not fork etc. Simply put the key features are likely to be centralized. Bitcoins will be assertes as digital _gold_, perhaps similar to what physical gold today is to fiat. Just my 2 Satoshis

I'm pretty sure that if one form of cash is outlawed, a new form is invented. Kind of like what happens in prisons. People need money. Deposited money on bank is not money, it's an iou.

Honestly i think it's going to Be worse before it gets better. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:50:21
Yes there are patterns. For instance when price crashed from 1000 level it went faster and longer compared to volatility last week. That's the thing, when price moves allot it often continue to move a whole lot. When it allows down, volatility slows down. Its always mirroring its last moves because people testing always looks at last moves.  When does it break away and stop doing that? When the spring is coild up ie major resistance or support is broken after consolidations . This might sound like mumbo jumbo creak but traders now what i talk about.

@_date: 2016-10-23 18:13:12
Aha, so you've now got them stored in an ethereum wallet? I swept my coins from one paper wallet, made a transaction offline and then sent a transaction where I'd split the coins into may paper wallets.
Actually, I don't se paper wallets. Instead I engrave the private key into the inside of beercans. Doesnt withstand high temperatures, but no problem spilling coffe on them so safer then real paper.
But before I send any coins to the paper wallet, I always add the private key to Bitcoin core (on offline CD booted computer) so check that I wrote down the private key correctly (importprivkey in debug window).
I never spend twice from a paper wallet or any other single address, because everytime you use an address you risk leaking some information and when quantum computers become common enough, they might be used to brute force addresses. If you never spent from an address, its not on the chain though - so less worries there.
I like to think of myself as somewhat of an armchair paranoid hobo security type of type-.

Well, there is no such thing as a stable currency and the PHI thing is broken by design (I don't mind chatting more about this, privately or publicly). That said, I don't care if its broken or not, as long as I can make money out of it before it breaks. If it's superior to Bitcoin, I don't mind riding the train.
EDIT: I do think that the way to boost a crypto network to go mainstream is by issuing debt. I also like the way PHI is being created and think it's very smart (but broken)!

The kind of wholly grail for many bitcoiners, is the dream of the "circular bitcoin economy", where goods and services are priced and then bought and sold for bitcoins only. You receive your salary i bitcoins and then buy stuff with it and round it goes. That's however somewhat of a pipe dream, or at least pretty much way in the future. Right not basically everything is priced either directly or indirectly to the dollar because dollar is the world reserve currency. That will change someday, but I don't think it will be bitcoins in the near future.
That said, there is also a lot to say about bitcoins as means of escaping capital controls and for "legal arbitrage", i.e. using bitcoins to buy stuff which can not be bought with dollars or plastic cards.
My bet is that the state will NOT like bitcoins (because they can not control it), but System D is going to love it (because the state can not control it). Hence bitcoins will be priced not in terms of dollar, but in terms of what you can do with it that you can not do with dollars.

And now I read his blog. OK so he totally misses the point about the inflationary properties of crypto. While Bitcoin is deflationary anyone can start a new Crypto coin and therfore there will be inflation in the total aggregate of crypto coins. Also the coins can be tokens representing shares in DACs. That way a wallet can be diversified, hedged and yet under the hood be fully decentralized and yet be used effortlessly (auto selling and converting between coins during point of sale). True, this does not exist yet, but I forsee that we will have these kinds of wallets in atleast 3 years time - probably sooner. The main issue I've got with traditional economics is that they think about how to fit cryptos in the existing infrastructure,  while the thing here is that our represents an "exit technology .

Buy 50% of your capital now.  If price goes lower, use 10% of remaining capital and buy more. If price goes lower,  repeat.  When price is very low (sub 100 at least) use 50% of remaining capital and buy btc on leverage that. If you blow the margin use the dollars you have left and buy more coins without leverage. Put coins in cold storage and wait a few years,  basically forget about it. When price have doubled a few times, sell enough coins to cover your initial investment. If price goes up more, sell 10% of the btc.  When you have 25% left of your coins stop selling and wait a decade.  using this strategy you will either lose all of your money or double your investment many times over. Probably better odds then playing the lottery and you might have some fun too. Good luck!

Someone could create a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, launch a new network basically for free, using Proof-of-Stake and then call it Bitcoin. Probably the most difficult thing would be to everyone to refer to this thing as Bitcoin (I think that is what luke-jr was saying). Since its Proof-of-Stake, this process could be repeated again and again and again. And again and again and again.... which is then the real PoS based Bitcoin?
I believe Proof-of-Stake is a viable option in finance, but then a blockchain isn't needed and also the stakers have to be entities recognized by authorities. Basically we've had this kind of systems already for a long time and there is nothing radically "new" about it. I don't think PoS has anything to do with Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:05:15
What happens depends on what people then do with their money. If they pay down debt it would be deflationary, if they buy stocks it would inflate the stock market. if people buy things in other countries, then things in other countries will go up in price, hence people there would experience inflation. So, depending on what people do with this money, affects the outcome of it.
