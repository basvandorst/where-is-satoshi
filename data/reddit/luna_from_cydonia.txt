no matter how popular the website can seem to be, I haven't received any invitations from the submitted ones yet. 2 weeks have passed. so, how can they speak about quick as hell using Bitcoin if I am not able to create an account?
have been in Amsterdam and seen the Circle presentation live. impressive, but lies.
