Now you've learned, never buy on all time highs of something hitting 20x it's initial value in only a couple months, it's probably a pump and dump and unlikely a large flux of investors within such a short period of time.

Yes, any business can accept Bitcoin just like a user would normally, the only thing that complicates it is paying taxes on the Bitcoin transactions in Fiat and converting to Fiat.

I mean it's becoming more and more useful as an everyday currency, and as the ecosystem grows and Bitcoin becomes more and more useful we'll have people buying Bitcoin for it's utility with intent to spend, rather than buying Bitcoin with intent to sell at a later date.

You realize banks are for storing digital money... Which is what we're doing right now, unless you want to spend money you don't have or want a savings in Fiat you don't necessarily NEED a bank... Which is one of the goals of Bitcoin to eliminate SOME of the need for banks.

I'm familiar with the fact that you need to pay a transaction fee to send bitcoin's quickly and that you don't have to but it will take significantly longer. 
I think Change tip doesn't pay transaction fees? Because once I got them to my Multibit wallet I sent them to my Phone for 1 cent instantaneously just like Dogecoin! :D   
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:12:01
They treat it like a speculative asset because it's value fluctuates so rapidly and the market can be manipulated relatively easily.

Why do you think Bitcoin will fail now? Sure the price has fallen over the past few months but back in 2010 there was a faucet that was giving out 10 Bitcoin per captcha filled, we've gone so far and the ecosystem is still so young.
There are projects in development that will give us new ways to use and spend their Bitcoin that simply isn't possible with fiat, here are some examples.
Open Bazaar, this is a decentralized, distributed, censorship resistant, global market place that deals exclusively in Bitcoin, they're currently in beta and can be found here: 
Then there's Ethereum which sets up a platform on top of the Blockchain that help's developers create decentralize services: 
and Bitcoin's a god send to online casino's, there are currently hundreds of games that can be wagered on in Bitcoin here are some examples:  and  (which is more of a mini-game) this is just the beginning, Bitcoin can also be used as in-game money for an MMORPG or something similar, this is currently just untapped potential but some developers over in the Dogecoin space are working on a game called "VoidSpace" that let's users send Crypto player to player allowing for users to be able to make money for doing in-game work as well as making Micro-payments friction-less and easy:
Bitcoin is currently easier to obtain than ever before with ATM's popping up everywhere (Shoutout to Skyhook!  as well as Coinbase and Circle making it easy to convert your fiat into Bitcoin online (Even with a credit card!)
Merchant Adoption is at an all time high with Microsoft and Time Magazine recently coming on board there are currently more than 10,000 Merchants accepting Bitcoin through Bitpay alone! (Source: also note the actual number of merchants that accept bitcoin is higher, I just couldn't find a solid number)
some big names that accept Bitcoin are Expedia, Over Stock, Microsoft, Dell, New Egg, Tiger Direct, Reddit, and Tesla.
Bitcoin has a huge potential to give a lot of power back to the people, and there is plenty more to come, the ecosystem is looking very healthy, and all of these services can function properly if the price is $10 per Bitcoin or $10,000 per Bitcoin either way I'll be here for the ride.

Do you understand how young 5 years is in the payment system world? Also most fiat exchanges do more volume in a day than Bitcoin has done since it's creation, it's still very young and the economy is still very small, this is all starting with NO government backing at all, just the backing of the currency by random internet people.
and merchants accept it because "people are harassing them"?, by "people" do you mean their customers? and yes they get their payment in dollars, but merchant acceptance isn't really for them, it's for us, it increases the utility of our Bitcoin, it's great for people who already have Bitcoin.
for some reason you decided to completely ignore Open Bazaar, and the possibility of using it as in-game currency for MMO's which is REALLY NEAT, SERIOUSLY HOW DO YOU NOT THINK THAT'S AWESOME!? and creates a whole new economy of micro payments that hasn't existed before.
And consumer protection, there is such a thing called "Escrow" if you haven't heard? We're still working out consumer protection, but the best part of Bitcoin is that it's all optional, it gives you options and privacy if you wish.
Another really fantastic part of Bitcoin is that you DO NOT have to use it, you don't have to browse a subreddit dedicated to it, you don't have to spend time researching it and insulting people who do believe in it.
Now, you obviously don't understand Bitcoin well enough to discredit it, and I don't have the time or the patience to properly explain it to you so let's completely drop that conversation and let me ask you.
Why are you here? Legitimate question, why are you browsing a subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin if you don't like Bitcoin? Why are you wasting your time in discussion attempting to discredit Bitcoin? if you think it's a bad investment why don't you go to penny stock subreddits? how about you go warn them? because it seems like you've made it your personal job to warn people of bad investments or "Scams", better yet how about you just leave? We don't want you here, you're not here to have legitimate discussion you're just here to harass people

Here's my legitimate guess, we're going to peak next year at $700 when there's a random pump and dump, then we'll end the year off at (hopefully) $500, not optimistic but really what I think will happen, but in the end it all depends on how many Unicorns are defecating at the same time during the summer solstice, that's when we'll know for sure.

If you have PayPal you can use WeSellDoge and buy some Doge then turn that into Bitcoin via Mintpal, that will get you a diminished return because of all the fees in between, but that's what I used to do and for every $10 I'd get like 8.96 worth of Bitcoin.
But then I got a circle invite and now everything's great and I can buy Bitcoin instantly.

Wow, stop being such a jackass.
Altcoins are solving their own problems and there are plenty of innovations among them (minus all the scams)
Like take Reddcoin: They're creating a tipping platform and a "Social wallet" Development seems to be pretty much just a few people, but still these ideas CAN be shared, someone could be inspired by this and create a Bitcoin wallet like this. Or Dogecoin:  They put their coin on a nascar! Which is just fun, but also they have people integrating Doge into games to use as an in-game currency which I think is awesome! Being able to do in-game work for people for real money is cool, anyways here are some of the projects incorporating Dogecoin into video games.
VoidSpace: 
Dogecoin Tipping Plug-in For Minecraft: 
The "Shibe World":
Of course the most important innovations are happening in the world of Bitcoin with things like OpenBizarre or DarkWallet but anything that increases Bitcoins utility is welcomed and I feel we could benefit from taking a pointer or two from these Altcoins.
@_date: 2014-12-13 10:28:04
Merchant adoption isn't really all that important, let me explain.
Right now it'd be just as easy for someone to use Fiat to purchase goods from Microsoft, OverStock, NewEgg, Dell, Expedia Ect, Merchant adoption tends to just be useful for people already holding Bitcoin, but doesn't give any reason for new users to join the Bitcoin Ecosystem, what does give consumers incentive is places that only accept Bitcoin.
Projects like Open Bazaar, and others like it that increase Bitcoins utility are what will bring Bitcoin into the mainstream. 
^ be sure to send a few bits their way, Open Bazaar will definitely be one of Bitcoins "Killer Apps"

Whooaaaaa Bitcoin doesn't NEED them, brick and mortar stores are NOT Bitcoin's strong suit, just because a large chain starts accepting Bitcoin doesn't mean that everyones going to go out and buy Bitcoin, why would they? Their Fiat works just fine there and Credit cards have consumer protection, Merchant adoption tends to just help people who are already using Bitcoin.
What brings people into the Bitcoin ecosystem are places that ONLY accept Bitcoin ie: Bitcasino, Open bizarre, stuff like that to be honest Merchant Adoption tends to not excite me all that much.

I got tipped 50 mBTC one time! Not on here on and then I got 17 on t'was rad, also I wasn't on RandomActsOfPizza to beg I tipped someone 3 dollars and then someone liked my username and tipped me 10 :D 
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:02:16
Alright, so this is what I would do.
1: Get this cleared up and continue working but have a little button on your shirt that has a bitcoin QR code for Bitcoiners to tip you with no fee to you and it's under the table.
2: Get a new job and still get the QR Code button, it'd cost like 4 dollars to make and ship to your house and if you're a Bitcoin fan it's nice to have AND possibility of free money :P.

Dogecoin has an MMO (VoidSpace) I think Crypto being used as in-game money is a badass idea, like people throwing around Bits or Doge because of the low cost per coin and then being able to withdraw your winnings and buy real life items is kind of cyberpunk/futuristic to me, Sword Art Online 2 (anime) is playing in Gun Gale Online where it's huge because the money can be covered into fiat and everyone's extra competitive and taking the game really seriously, that for me is one of the coolest applications for Crypto currency that I can think of.

I like iPhones/iOS but the lack of customization and the $650 price tag for the base model was to much for me so I got a Nexus 5 it's $350 and I'm absolutely in love with it, I've had 0 problems and I have an iPad (original) and I've learned it's very difficult to just port files from my computer to my iOS device and view them... Throw Apple being Anti-Bitcoin and it sealed the deal for me when I was looking for a smartphone.

All the faucets suck now, I try to use them but they send the BTC to a different site which I control but has a minimum withdraw so I can't get any Bitcoins unless I go to like 40 more faucets and send them to that account which is binded to my wallet address :( 
Coming from Dogecoin, Bitcoin's aren't as welcoming and I own exactly 0 Bitcoins because doesn't have people selling Bitcoin for Paypal gifts like on which makes it more difficult.

I think what's probably the neatest part of Bitcoin is that if someone's semi familiar with CSS and HTML they can add a Bitcoin donation tab to their site, they don't need to sign up for anything, they don't have to work with anyone else all they have to do is add a spot that say's "Donate via Bitcoin" and add a QR code, it's brilliant.

God fucking damn it, you're pulling me in to troll me but I'll bite.


us random internet people are the developers, investors, and users that are backing Bitcoin, we're doing this all without government control and we've gotten pretty far without any help.


It's not about fulfilling the needs of everyone, gaming is a big market and sometimes it's not about mainstream acceptance it's just about making something rad.


obviously you've done very little research on the project,someone would have to fork the code, and make a similarish clone to make it viable as a illicit marketplace.


Yeah, you're right, still working that one, everyone had to start somewhere and like I said, Bitcoin is still very small.
also "victims" do you ever read the front page here? xD We ALWAYS urge users to NEVER invest more than they can afford to lose, we urge people to be cautious and do research to see if Bitcoin is for them the discussion you see of "TO THE MOON!" are people who already researched and believe in Bitcoin.
Also you're using "Buttcoinfoundation" as a source, Hahaha that basically seals the deal, you're just trolling me and the conversation is over, not because I'm "losing" but because it's 3am and I have to sleep soon, also because you like to completely disregard my points and make ignorant statements about them, you're even resorting to name calling "ponzi scheme sketchy currency" which is just sad, I'm sorry you're such a hate filled human being I hope that one day you find peace, have a good night, m8 I will r8 this deb8 8/8 don't be l8.

Bitcoin really isn't a get rich quick scheme, even though the way it's designed has it act that way, it's just a viable alternative currency that ISN'T backed by a government, perhaps it's the future? maybe Bitcoin isn't, but now that so many people have been exposed to crypto everyone basically knows that some form of Crypto is the future.

I would not invest right now, although it's a very bad idea to guess where the bottom for Bitcoin will be regarding price, with the recent events surrounding Bitstamp and the possible scandal that could happen, Bitcoins price could potentially fall much further (even into the low $200's) personally I'd wait a couple of days to invest as to get the best price, but disclaimer I'm not really that experienced in trading Bitcoin I only have 750,000 Bits.

@_date: 2015-02-09 18:55:47
Bitcoin's price is based on it's supply vs demand (obviously) and demand goes up when the Utility of Bitcoin increases and drives more people into the economy. 
like if there was a store that ONLY accepted Bitcoin or an online service that only dealt in Bitcoin, it'd drive more people in because they would have a use for Bitcoin, growing the economy. 
Normal merchant adoption (ie: Overstock, NewEgg, Microsoft) aren't as important as things like Dark net markets, BitCasino.io or Open Bazaar. but for people who already have Bitcoin it's very useful, because let's say you sell something like a shirt on Open Bazaar you can easily spend the money you just acquired at over 100,000 merchants.
So to summarize, merchant adoption isn't really that big of a deal for people who don't already have Bitcoin.

Yeah, but it's much easier to build services that rely on Bitcoin than to get every merchant to accept bitcoin.
