Can be this, i think they are starting to talking about crypto as a whole, to give ppl confidence, and when we will get to 20k they will start to focus on a single cryptos they have invested in, to promote it for a huge profits. Its just like us, first it was bitcoin, now we are all shilling our portfolio alts

This, its just like Vechain, they have big investors but these investors didnt bought vechain from the market, they bought millions of them from the foundation OTC.
