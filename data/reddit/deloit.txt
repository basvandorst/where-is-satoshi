How can you pay in BTC but also HODL
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:34:52
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:23:03
lol not what I said at all. There are plenty of people who trade for a living. If you sell higher than you purchased, rebuy at a lower rate and it keeps falling, how is that any worse than just holding. What are you dumb?
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:59:52
He is. It's called bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:51:08
In that case, I would say your idea is much better. lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:34:02
No. A parabola is just a U in any direction. The definition is a curve created from three points - one at each end of the line and one at the top/bottom of the curve.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:52:35
Can you just answer the damn question?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:21:29
It's funny that you put 'secondary coins' in quotes, as though they're not. Bitcoin is the market leader. The others are all secondary until they're not.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:15:39
Yeah why do you think you couldn't touch it until you're 25. In hopes that you don't do something stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:46:06
So someone died and you just dumped all of the money into one highly volatile thing. Kind of indicative of your regard for money and that person's legacy. Easy come easy go
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:23:56
Yeah - it's called a parabola. We're on the other side of it now.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:01:37

HAHA more FUD. Weak ass FUD. I'm going to take out a third mortgage and sell a kidney to buy even more Bitcoin after reading this FUD. lol bleach tier FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:40:04
Because blockchain is a good concept while Bitcoin is a get rich quick casino with a bunch of n00b money in it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:19:04
Does the currency necessarily need to be in BTC in order to accomplish that? Why can't banking institutions apply blockchain technology to existing currencies? Is it because there aren't enough computers in their network? Trying to understand.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:50:19
I guess people shouldn't overdraft their account, then, right?
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:47:39
oh yeah, good point - just an ad lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:25:42
BUT MUH BITCOIN IS DIFFERENT
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:52:36
What do you mean "bitcoin would crack down"? WTF does that mean? Bitcoin is going to crack down on someone? What?
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:39:41
People that know how to short can make money both ways. People that don't like bears are obvious n00bs who just click refresh on Coinbase all day long and tell their friends how they're big investment experts bc they have money in Crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:28:30
No, it won't. It will be adopted by established institutions and integrated into existing currencies. The bitcoin tokens themselves are basically a scam. Just ask Charlie Lee.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:51:18
If he'd found them a month sooner and SODL he'd have even more money.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:32:58
Are you comparing trading a small portion of your assets, learning to read charts, and sticking to a set of conservative profit taking best practices to being an addict? lol
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:57:30
Comparing something to something old doesn't automatically imply it's also old. Is comparing Bitcoin to Tulip Madness to imply that bitcoin is old or a type of plant? No. It's only to comment on the potential bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:56:27
Napster sucked, but it was first to be widely adopted in the mainstream market and had the highest brand recognition. Just like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:12:26
Lol nice try you FUDdy duddy. Just because you wrote this bleach tier FUD comment I'm going to take a third mortgage out on my house and exchange my kids for $10,000 each at a pawn shop and buy more BTC and Potcoin. Weak ass FUD lol
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:15:46
I like blockchain technology but I like making money off of bitcoin tokens. Two different things.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:47:12
lol yeah maybe I was thinking of someone else then. My bad, dude.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:34:53
The skill would be selling before the panic selloff and then buying back in to increase your position.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:30:18
Sounds like Rocky took one too many headshots.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:20:04
You really couldn't tell my comment was sarcastic or did you think I was actually going to sell my kids to a pawn shop? If you think that's a believable scenario for a Bitcoin HODL'er I think we've identified the real problem.
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:42:33
I think what he's saying is that it would be a financial catastrophe for people who are over-leveraged at the current levels, ya know?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:15
No - you're not very smart. Yes, it's the same on both sides - In this case, on the left side you are going up, on the right side you are going down. What are you - stupid?
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:43:13
What the hell?
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:05:36
Did you sell the high?
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:02:03
Yes they can lol
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:52:40
Wow very creative 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:11:26
Difficult to obtain is not the same thing as scarce. Scarcity is driven by high demand and low supply. Hard to obtain, if anything, would just facilitate low utility and less people holding the currency, probably driving its value down, tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:22:12
You didn't even explain your rationale so I returned the favor.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:50:51
You dope are you just making things up? This isn't creative writing class dummy.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:15:48
Should have SODL at 8 or 9x and bought back somewhere below that. HODL isn't a skillset. Trading is.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:08:50
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:24:23
You are out of your goddamn mind if you don't think a billion impressions and omnipresence on Facebook (especially in the trending column) didn't make awareness of bitcoin rocket through the goddamn roof with stories of overnight millionaires and speculation of it could go to a MILLION dollars per coin sent the price from $5K to $20K in a month. Why do you think the just banned the ads? One less thing they could be liable for out of fear they'll be blamed for a global economic collapse in a couple of years in addition to russian meddling, fake news, attention span disorders, and all the other heat that is prompting massive changes in their news feed lately, including BANNING all ads related to crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:47:03
lol but muh technology
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:07:13
Old FUDdy Duddies
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:07:45
I wonder how it feels to pretend you're a big hotshot financial advisor and big boy pants investor and be cavalier with advising other people what to do with their money and then they lose it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:34:38
lol seriously
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:35:44
Ah, you must be one of those people who drink overpriced coffee. I can buy an entire bag of imported beans, grind them myself and make an entire pot of coffee for a dollar. You must be confusing buying good coffee with buying ambiance, cache, and beautiful packaging.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:04:11
You might be better off lower your expectations to lollipops at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:30:53
Didn't know hypotheses were wrong by design
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:33:44
That's great. Are you day trading or just HODLing and taking profit? Just wondering.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:51:37
I don't see a relationship between caring about not going broke in a nascent, volatile trading market and caring about the tech. They're not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:00:06
Lol consider yourself TRODL
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:06:41
Why does the price need to be high in order for the tech to be adopted?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:23:45
You were also referring to HODL as a skill. It's not.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:11:47
I think you're projecting now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:35:10

@_date: 2018-01-30 14:16:09
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:01:05
It's not negative if you're currently out of the market and waiting for a good re-entry point. It's a matter of perspective.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:24:16
No - $5K will be the right time. If you want the REALLY right time wait for $3K.
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:36:55

haha go for it literally 99% chance it's $1,000,000+/coin by March haha
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:34:23
it's ok man because like you're supporting crypto or something dude imagine if it was a credit card or your bank account or PayPal you could like let "the man" investigate the case and help you get it back and that would be like supporting government or something
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:24:49
No, it's definitely not luck. It's just selling higher than you buy, not getting greedy, following a disciplined trading strategy, learning how to read charts, etc. Nobody is saying time the market perfectly, but when Charlie Lee sells all his Litecoins, you sell, when the price of Bitcoin undergoes a meteoric rise fueled by social media, you anticipate a cooling of the market and sell. Lather, rinse, repeat. BTW there are plenty of people that trade for a living and do well with it, so no, not luck.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:49:17
Why would countries banning it make it scarce?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:34:31
lol cool story
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:48:50
Why does the price need to be high in order for Bitcoin and blockchain to succeed?
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:16:29
Right. Markets don't like uncertainty so they would likely transfer their dollars into the most unstable currency in existence in a nascent market. Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:01:37
cool creative writing exercise bro
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:30:21
Why doesn't he just sell it for whatever and go buy bitcoin with the funds

Are you a moron? You don't think demand for currency is fueled by belief in utility or intrinsic value? What are you - an idiot?
Also, what kind of values do you have that you would shape your behavior around "making" your wife's family like you? lol? Probably the kind of guy that has so little self-respect that you'll lose all your money on bitcoin and still rationalize the behavior of the market. I mean you didn't even read the story correctly given your characterization of it. Really sad reading comprehension skills - no wonder you're still HODL'ing.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:31:35
Uhh I mean yeah I think that people believing in the currency at scale is the basis of anything having value. What are ya dumb? lol
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:22:14

Nah just the two lowest hanging rotten maggot filled fruits
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:02:40
I don't think "you want to make money" constitutes greediness lmao. Are you just rationalizing losing your entire family's life savings on bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:12:52
I didn't say that you have to "believe it's a currency" - I said that demand for currency is fueled by a collective belief in its use to exchange for goods and services. Are you stupid, sir?
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:10:14

My comment sounds "denigrating and belittling" in response to the above comment which is literally denigrating and belittling to "normies"? Do you see the irony of your criticism? Do you also see that just because my comment upsets you, it doesn't mean it's incorrect?

@_date: 2018-02-05 14:03:16
I don't think Warren Buffet is typically referring to highly volatile currencies in a nascent market when he is referring to a long-term holding strategy. And he certainly isn't referring to buying anywhere near the top of an obviously social-media fueled meteoric bubble. BTW Warren Buffet also said crypto isn't going to end well, so I doubt he endorses a HODL strategy if you've already seen a 10-1,000X return.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:44:07
To protect themselves from not being able to be paid back by a bunch of crypto-dopes after the bubble bursts.

Because it's a simple interface with the most brand awareness and trust factor. Also, if you're only holding one of the major coins, and the philosophy is to HODL, then you don't need the more advanced functions of the other platforms.

Keep coming with those belittling remarks. Care to comment on the "cubicle warping their minds" comment pertaining to people earning an honest living that happens to differ from investing in a ponzi scheme? As I said before, I hate cubicle culture and everything that comes with it, but wiring some money into coinbase doesn't automatically make you better than everyone.
BTW without all of those "normies", there would likely be no products for you to spend your fake currency on.

Many wealthy people DON'T consider it a safe haven, too. So what you have done sir is created an appeal to wealth fallacy.

Try putting that down on a mortgage application and let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:54:15
Yeah, you do - you need to get a grip. Maybe a day job, too.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:15:25
Ok. Let's take a step back.
1. You responded to my comment and said I was being denigrating and belittling.
2. My comment was in response to someone saying sitting in a cubicle must warp the normies' brains.
3. Just by calling someone a normy, it is implied that you are &gt; than normal. Hence, superior.
4. You framed your issue with my comment as stemming from it being "belittling and denigrating"
5. You didn't address the belittling and denigrating nature of the comment that preceded mine, that was pro-crypto.
6. Hence, you are clearly just butthurt about cryptocurrency, and your appeal to morality and respect is fallacious.

Poop machine - that's some true shit.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:26:22
Why would I be rebuking your shitty creative writing exercise you delusional twit.

I hate cubicles and the entire culture that goes with it, but dumping some money into crypto doesn't make you some sort of tie-burning entrepreneur, guys.

Damn he might actually have to start paying attention in class with the intention of getting something out of it and making money the old fashioned way instead of staring at Coinbase and drooling all day.

"naive" lol puuuuuhhhhhlease. This is a full on meltdown
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:41:08
When was the last time you had a meltdown following billions of impressions being pushed out on Facebook, hundreds of thousands if not millions of casuals putting their money into a nascent market grabbing the attention of governments and regulatory institutions and driving awareness through the roof followed by a complete collapse of confidence and sentiment

Oh, ok. Tell that to the people that invested in Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Facebook 3-5 years ago.

Swap out the number 7K in increments of $500-$1,000 and backload it over the last 7 days and you've basically summarized this entire sub for the past week.

I understand what you're saying. But what I don't get is that people say "HODL" and then compare it to Warren Buffet, and Warren Buffet is very much interested in investing in things with the objective of growing his investments, so I think people that say HODL are very mixed up in many cases and don't even really know what they're saying. On one hand they're saying HODL and comparing to Warren Buffet, implying they're interested in turning a profit, and then when you pick their silly arguments apart, they start talking about it objective being to use bitcoin as a currency and "MUH TECH". So it's all very confusing.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:16:01
lmao exactly
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:32:29
lol nope

Yeah go put it in r/conspiracytheories. And if it doesn't work without fake tokens, why are legitimate companies and institutions developing their own blockchain tech?
