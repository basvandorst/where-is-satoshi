It sounds like they have a problem with their UTXO set due to mismanagement. They are in a position where their only solution is either the fee's dramatically drop or the blocksize increases. 
Setwit won't help THEM because they still have to move their funds.

Segwit is backwards compatible. It won't show until confirmed. See: 
Relevant quote:
    When spending bitcoins you received after upgrading to segwit to 
    someone who has not upgraded to segwit, they may not see your 
    transaction until after it is included in a block. This is a safety feature that 
    avoids showing them transactions their wallet doesn’t entirely understand 
    until those transactions have confirmed. After the transaction confirms, 
    they will be able to see and spend the bitcoins you sent them like normal.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:05:02
I agree the fee pressure will drop but if they have UTXO's that they can't spend (even to send to a segwit wallet) then they have some big issues. Having said that I'd assume they could recuperate it via fee's but as it stands it sounds like they can't access all the crypto they want and could be a good reason why they desperately want to upgrade the blocksize. Perhaps they forgot to set a minimum UTXO to retain.
Having said that, we've had an empty mempool in the last 3 months so I can't figure out why they didn't just consolidate at below 1sat/byte. 
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:50:44
It takes a real person time to dig through the log, verify it really is you and then manually generate the transaction to send back. Have you offered to pay them for that time?
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:45:22
If the transaction is visible in the explorer then its done and just awaiting confirmation.
Its possible its something to do with the fact Mycellium doesn't support segwit? Or as the other poster said, the fee was too low for the node mycellium connected to still have it in the mempool. Either way, nothing to worry about, when it eventually confirms you'll see it.

Something worth knowing is that the internet itself started with source routing.  In some cases you can actually still use the relevant flags (2 in this case) in the packet headers to specify the route a packet takes from the source though many routers will simply drop these packets. Source routing is considered impossible to scale due to the sheer amount of memory and calculations needed.
Eventually we moved to a dynamic routing protocol that we still use today called eBGP (Border Gateway Protocol) which allows every node (technically can be consider a router but we can also treat whole opaque networks as a single node since the network itself will have its own methods to route through it) to know how to reach a collection of addresses by storing a list of the lowest cost path to the authoritative node.  This is advertised out to all directly connected nodes fairly efficiently and until recently is what I considered one of the only truely globally affected networks.  I can advertise a network in Sweden and see the affect almost immediately on a random router in Japan.
Now days due to IPV4 exaustion the BGP routing tables are getting larger and we are once again reaching the old inefficiencies of source routing since each node now needs to store smaller and smaller collections to route to.
Lighting will need to solve these problems without repeating past mistakes.  Dynamic routing is something fascinating to many different fields ranging from compsi to mathematics.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:09:34
Youtube encrypts the stream with https so in this case a man in the middle can't know anything more than youre connecting to YouTube and your IP.
Lightning used something similar to onion routing conceals what you are doing between intermediate nodes and if you run it on tor as well you hide your IP, but I presume well known nodes will give you knowedge what service you are using and also the intermediate node will know the amount.
@_date: 2019-07-25 04:44:47
Pretty sure short term is 50% and long term (held longer than a year) is 25%. 
Note that for so called expensed purchased (no capital gains) it would have to be done quickly. As in you purchase btc to then purchase a good. This incurs no capital gains as they consider the gain and loss between the short period to be neglible, as long as the amount is less than $10k though the language here is a little ambiguous.
However if you purchased it 2 years ago to then buy a good now they will consider the capital gains.
Also worth noting they consider ETC as the ethereum chain with ETH at the time considered to have a cost basis of 0.

There is a Max of 21 million coins. 12.5 are mined every 10 minutes. Every 4 years that reward is halved so in 2020 it will be 6.25. The last tiny fraction of a coin is theorised to be in 2140.
After the next halvening the fees are expected to be making up significant amounts of the reward so eventually only the fees will sustain miners.

It's one of Bitcoins hard promises. That it is highly improbable that they can be recovered one they are finalized on the blockchain which basically can be understood as having enough blocks built on top to make a reorg improbable. This is generally accepted be 6 confirmations (about 60 minutes) for nearly any amount (let's say an amount equal to the cost to find and bribe 51% of the miners and/or substantial portion of the economic nodes to change the chain)
This means when dealing directly on the main chain you have certain guarantees that cannot be changed.
PayPal or a credit card does not give this guarantee and thus you can only generally consider the amount finalized only after 60 days as it can be reversed. This changes depending on how the settlement occurs of course.
If one wants some safety they they can use a service built on the mainnet that provides the ability to reverse (until of course they finalize it themselves on the main chain). This raises an interesting point which is talked about in one of Andropolous' talks that you can always take a hard promise and soften it to a soft promise but you can never do the reverse (ie you can't implement Bitcoin on PayPal or credit as it would inherit it's reversibility)

Except for the Bitcoin blockchain. We use BCH as a backup battery. Each time Bitcoins mempool gets congested and fees go over 60sat/byte Bitcoin gets more profitable and attracts spare hash power from BCH to quickly clear the mempool. BCH is Bitcoins bitch here.

Best to ignore them. Let them go their way.

I've often wondered why RBF was not designed to only allow upping the fee but not allow replacing the outputs (note miners don't even have to obey this. Its basically like asking them nicely to do something a certain way). was there a reason for replacing outputs or was it only for the case where you can refund it back to yourself? I can only assume the reason was to rebalance the fee's (by reducing an output) but surely there could be a way to only allow the fee to be removed and no other changes?

Just be aware that faucets create lots of mini transactions. when you eventually try to move them don't be surprised by a huge fee because the fee is based on number of unspent transactions and not on the total amount of btc.
After you move them they will be consolidated into one utxo and will then have the normal fee.

@_date: 2017-12-18 03:44:05
The simple fact is that most full nodes have a limit of how many transactions they store in memory. If they hit this limit they eject low fee transactions from the pool. This is why you are having issues. Its the nodes your wallet and bitpay are connecting to that are losing the transactions.
No money lost. Its just the fact its a low fee at the moment. Explains why its coming back now and then because the node may have freed up some memory and re-added it or you connected to a different node with higher memory requirements.

Ahh of course. That doesn't help lol ;) Bit of a strange time at the moment. Hopefully resolved with off-chain transactions. On-chain, no mater how cheap will also be beholden to factors like waiting for confirmation, fee market, and simply how much memory the full nodes allocate. Too many factors out of our control, whereas off-chain like LN has fixed speed, fix fee's and no such thing as a mempool. I'm excited for offchain for more than just cheap fee's... it makes any transaction very predictable and without all this wish wash of other factors.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:17:40
Australian exchange have a slight premium and fees around 0.8% so it's one way to compare. Coinbase will only allow you to purchase but won't allow you to sell back to your bank account so you'll need a local exchange anyway.

I hope BCH comes to its full potential I really do. I absolutely love analysing some of the game theory and analysing attacks and BCH has certainly provided a lot of entertainment but the data gathered from that is absolutely invaluable. 
When else would we ever know the effect of something like the EDA? And its been educational learning how all the various pieces (miners, nodes, users, etc) all act and bringing that all back to game theory. I hope we all look back on these as somewhat fond memories.
I look forward to some of BCH's innovation. Whilst I can't agree with GB blocks I could be wrong and I'm interested to see how it all pans out.

It will either clear with bitpay (then you'll need to chase them up) or will drop from the mempool after about 2 weeks. I have a 80sat transaction stuck for a week now (I wasn't in a rush).
One option is to use a transaction accelerator. Try them on the hour each hour and you may get in. Google a few up.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:56:18
I understand your point. However the currency is young and as such it will have to go through a speculative growing stage. If btc somehow started at a value of $10million per coin and was fully premined and uniformly distributed then it would be super stable.
However it's slowly having more people use it and thus its value will rise simply because of a liquidity squeeze. Once a certain percent of people use it (most likely purely for speculation at this stage) then the gatekeepers and businesses will be attracted enough to start spending time on implementing it (visa/MasterCard would be a perfect usecase for payment channels) and once enough of those businesses do it will slowly become more acceptable as a currency and less as a speculative vehicle.
I think we are years away from that point yet. I think Bitcoins value would need to be several magnitudes higher before it's volatility will creep down. And as a developer in the space I see a lot of very very interesting projects that are being built around it.
Be skeptical because that's healthy. But hedge your bets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:39:10
Yeah I can see one way payment channels likely in the near future if something is standardised for wallets to use. It is somewhat ironic that BCH requires a more centralized solution to payment channels when their prime complaint of lightning is it's centralized.
I've never quite understood why people defend so hard only miners getting fees. Lightning nodes are simple a new layer of 'miners' and I don't see them any more centralized than the blockchain miners.

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:59:29
If the fork has already happened then you can't because Coinbase will have them, even if you move to your wallet now.
If you are holding them in your wallet and THEN the fork occurs, you can then use the same master seed that you used to generate the wallet in a fork-coin wallet to see the coins on the fork. Obviously be careful and send your BTC to a new address first (which won't affect your fork coins) because some fork-coin wallets are scams that will grab your key and then steal your valuable bitcoin instead.

That's an interesting take on it. I'll have to think about that a little more to see how well that analogy holds. 
What's interesting is that with mining the fee's will logically go up as space is limited on-chain. This is one of the arguments amongst many alt-coins that artificially limiting space is a bad thing. I see the space as precious and it should be paid for fairly but like everyone we don't yet have enough figures to really know for sure.
The 2nd layer solutions flip that on their heads. There is competition to drive the fee's down and indeed there are scenarios where fee's could be negative (much like you get cash back on some credit cards). The competition could mean large players will get more influence but that's quite similar to POS centralization as well. As long as anyone can run an LN and be useful then I think the centralization aspect is a more limited thing and certainly better than our current fully centralised scenario of VISA/Mastercard/BitPay.

It sounds like your email account is compromised more than an issue on the exchange logically. You may be able to confirm this if you can get a log of ip addresses accessing your email account.
Lots of malware steal email user/pass and the thiefs just monitor passively an email account till something interesting is found in it. This is becoming a large issue and catches even the most tech savvy users, especially if running windows.
You need to:
  1. Clean/reinstall/check every pc you've logged into email on
  2. Change your email password promptly
  3. Enable 2fa and change passwords on btc-e
Good Luck. I consider myself a security expert and somehow got my blizzard account compromised in my windows vm (thankfully i never touch email in windows and confirmed that no-one else ever logged into my mail server) though to this day i'm still suspicious if it wasn't a database leak on their side.

I'll be honest and say I've been in a similar boat. When Diablo3 came out I booted to windows to play it. My account got 'hacked', which generally means either their server was compromised or somehow my windows boot that I use exclusively for games and nothing else had a trojan. I was annoyed because I'm super security conscious and know all the tricks.
I used all of my skill to see if I could find a trojan and found nothing. I scanned my mailserver logs to see if someone had my mail password and were perhaps scanning messages for passwords and all the ip's belonged to me. So I don't know how it happened (assuming their server was not compromised). However I also realised that even as much as I know about security, I still could not say with 100% certainty that there was not something I had missed. So I ended up blowing away the whole windows boot and resetting it up.
Moral of this story: I still have a hunch that Blizzard lost the password, not me but will never know, but the maths behind Bitcoin make me trust that its almost impossible that someone else could guess a private key with funds on it.

I can understand. Its bloody embarrassing and in the case of Bitcoin can literally make them all nod their heads sagely and say 'I knew that Bitcoin scheme was a ponzi' when the technology itself is pretty sound.
I lost 17BTC doing some stupid things whilst trading and whilst it was something I can afford to lose (thats the ultimate thing to remember with any investment) its still a chunk of change. I run my own business but suddenly found I was just not doing well at it suddenly. I lost the ability to program as well for a while. It took me a while to realise that the greater thing I lost, something I could never quantify with a value, was my confidence. I mean if I just lost $10K worth of coins then surely my other decisions are suspect? It took me 4 months to get that confidence back. Time will tell if my lesson was a cheap one. I certainly won't make the same mistake again.
My only suggestion (to whoever reads this comment and for any loss on investment), is if you've got close family (spouse/partner/parents etc) that its worth the cringe/embarrassment to confide. Trying to fix something alone is really difficult.

It's an interesting question. What happens when two very long chains that fork very early rejoin. They presumably would be similar length as the weaker chain difficulty would drop after 2016 blocks, and then it would create blocks at the same rate as the strong chain. 
It's like taking the genesis block and mining on it on a private network on a machine with its date set back, but with 1 miner so it's difficulty remains low, then syncing when it hits present day. That is, using an asic to solve it quick, but then slew the time another 10mins ahead so it looks like it's only solving every 10 mins.
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:23:28

User A adds User B to their list. What happens is A creates a priv/pub key, then sends the pub key to the server with a request for B. B will be grey on their list.
When B next logs in they get the request plus the pub key. They generate their own priv/pub key, then send the 'Accept' back to the server with their pub key, their Bitcoin pub address and sign or encrypt it with A's pub key. At this point B can't know if its really A's pubkey yet.
When A is next in (or straight away if already in), they get the 'Accept', plus a pub key, and a signature. A checks the signature to see if it matches their priv key. If it does, A sends back a 'Success' message to the server, signed with B's key.
Hmmm, on second thought A still can't know for sure its getting info from B. I'll keep thinking.
@_date: 2017-02-04 05:13:58
I guess the sub-question is therefore: how many blocks will a node throw out to satisfy the conditions? 
My guess is that if you tried to mine from genesis and at the same perceived solve rate the difficulty would leap up to where it is now (so impossible) and perhaps at a smaller scale a more recent fork would behave the same. Therefore the strong chain will always by default be even slightly longer.
Even if you solved at difficulty 1, then tried to cram in thousands of blocks per second at the end it would ramp up to the same difficulty requirement.

Thanks for the support and you write it succinctly. There are two issues here. One is a development issue and the other is a Political one.
The 1Mb limit in Core could be either. They could be stubbornly sticking to 1Mb for political reasons OR could be doing it because by changing it things would break. That is the point of contention and not one I want to debate as its been done and my personal feelings about it don't really matter ultimately.
BU can put ALL their appropriate changes on top of Core and thus change that for their reasons. They do this and gain all of Cores benefits but add their own. Then those that support them will get Core's benefits as well AND Core can 'come to their senses' and just merge in the BU changes, should they wish. BU ALSO gets those who are 'unsure about the change, but kinda want those changes, but just just don't trust a new team'.
My main point, is that I think there is a tragic amount of wasted effort going on. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:39:11

I'm really unsure how that relates. I'm excited we have a decentralized immutable ledger.

@_date: 2017-03-25 04:04:45
Correct, I only deal with Centralized.
However the model works irregardless. Why throw away perfectly good commits just because. What happens is you end up with code that no-one wants to support.
Centralised means that Core would always be an upstream. Decentralised based upon common code means there is no 'upstream' but there is no reason not to keep close with other implementations and add your bits on top. There are a lot of smart people out there. Don't waste time.
Put it this way. Would more miners be interested in the large blocks + choice of BU plus the stability and maturity of core? It may not be the 'best way', but its gotta be better than the divergence.
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:47:10
By doing that, they immediately caused a 'hard fork' in the development. It means that to survive they have to either become dominant, fast, and/or write their code so it remains in consensus with the standard. Either way its a huge risk and huge effort (for the losing 'fork'), loss of all the tests/security of the other dev team, for minimal gain.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:06:09

I'm not entirely happy with RBF either. However its really easy to have defines around this and still pull the code as its not hardfork-inducing code.
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:36:18
Perfect example. "If core would introduce 2mb hardfork ... "
There are 2 reasons for Core not to. Its either going to cause some major technical problem, or someone picked an arbitrary number and decided to stick to it. It doesn't particularly matter to most people which reason it is, its just an option they don't agree with.
Lets look at Segwit. A core initiated change. It requires 95% activation rate. Thats a super majority. I don't think a single person could say that Core is making it easy for themselves. They are choosing the cautious path, even if it means a feature will not be included OR will take time to be included.
Someone wants a 2MB fork? Or an 8Mb? Or a 64Mb? Fork Core, then add that feature, then allow miners to signal for activation of the block size upgrade. It can be ORed with the Segwit activation flag. Require 95% activation as well. No-one could say you were not playing by the strict rules. Reach the 95% activation for big blocks but not segwit? Well I doubt anyone could complain.
This "Enforced Segwit by a certain date no matter what", or "51% orphan mining to enforce Bitcoin Unlimited blocks", or "Users will choose the option and force miners to a new POW" are troubling and technically challenging options.

Very low fee so it'll take probably another 4 hours. I avoid that wallet but it it supports replace-by-fee then you can bump the fee up (if not I suggest a better wallet). You can also try spend the change from the transaction to another of your addresses with a super high fee (let's say 80sat per byte) which will uses cpfp to combine both fees.
I suggest just wait it out.

I trust an exchange far more than a localbitcoin person, and even an exchange I take my cash/coins off quick.
Lots of good suggestions in this thread. I recommend finding a good exchange and going through the KYC approach to sell for cash then transfer out.
Unless of course you're not wanting this to touch a bank account. Then it gets more risky (a weakness of digital currency at the moment) and paying a premium for in-person exchange with localbitcoin is your only option.

A few kids were teasing a boy called Jack. They would come to him, holding a $2 coin in one hand and a 50c coin in the other hand and say "you can keep whichever coin you like".
Jack would always pick the 50c coin and the other kids would laugh and laugh at him whilst passing over the coin. Just so you know here a 50c coin is physically larger than the $2 coin so many young kids would think it's worth more.
I later spoke to Jack, "You realise the other kids are making fun of you because you are picking the lower value coin"
He responded "I know. Do you think they would keep giving me money if I chose the $2 coin?"

Actually I wasn't talking about them. I can't for the life of me find where I learned this but the fork to fix the unlimited coin production resulted in the 50 newly minted coins not being generated for that specific block. I'll try find that info as it's bugging me now...

Correct me if I'm wrong but due to the hard-fork in bitcoin's early days, the 50 coin's that would have been generated for that block did not actually take place, so that means the total amount of bitcoins to ever be produced will be 20,999,950.

That's great. My one bit of advice to especially keep on the right side of the adults is to look at it from how exciting it is from a technology side. Looking at it purely from a speculative side (IE, put in $5 and see it become $10 later for example) can be exciting but can also feel too similar to just gambling/ponzi scheme.
Think about ways that an immutable ledger can be used in other projects perhaps that can be totally unrelated to currency. A good example is pharmacy prescriptions. And research a little about how stuff like Merkel tree's and general cryptography works because they hold true in many other fields.

Like some bitcoiners, there is a very vocal minority with Bitcoin Cash who may give that impression.
A POW change is by its very nature a nodes enforced change.
I think many people often underestimate the power of the nodes. I like to think of them like the pawns on a chess board. A piece that is often not thought of much but an immensely powerful piece nonetheless. Its trivial to spin up more of them but they hold immense position of power whilst having the weakest voice.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:25:15
The other miners and all non-spv nodes would ignore it and orphan it. The nodes that make up the network play an important role. Miners have to obey the rules or risk losing their reward.

I'm not sure how 2fa would help? Wouldn't the malicious program have access to the seed or are you running it with a hardware Wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:45:00
I can't imagine how an existing miner can at all be involved in a POW change since by its very nature its a node-only enforced change.
If the nodes all changed to force CPU mining rules, do you think the fact that suddenly the SHA256 hashrate suddenly disappearing would cause any problems? Suddenly everyone and their dog would be taking their place.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:57:37
No I don't believe there is any priority. Its merely what a miner chooses to accept.
So a miner that want's to maximize profit would just take the top most valuable transactions in its mempool that fit into the block and include them. Nothing more than that.
But yes, if the blocks are not full then it would make it into a block. I'd rather get 7sat/byte than 0 any day ;)
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:57:08
If I get a chance tomorrow I'll spin up some Java to simply decrypt the actual private key and see if that helps, but it's sounding like either the format changed or your password is invalid (try all caps, etc)
One thing you could try do is perform a backup on another empty key using bither, compare the output string to see if the format matches your real one, then perform a restore, just so you know it works both ways.

@_date: 2017-08-06 09:11:46
Your trezor generated the address so you should be able to regenerate it, redeem script and all, once segwit activates. There's a script in the trezor subreddit I was going look at that does the signing. Trying to learn about this as I go.
I have a couple of concerns that I hope will be unfounded.
First, as segwit is not activated I believe your public address is technically an "anyone can spend" address. So don't pass it out just in case. Only a miner could directly mine it as anyone else trying to will not be allowed to broadcast the transaction.
Secondly, I'm not quite sure how segwit activates. If it's at a specific block height, does that mean transactions that happen before that block height can not be validated by the segwit rules ever? I've not found an answer to this one yet. Perhaps can confirm this or not.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:39:03
Sounds like it should be fine. You may need to perform a reindex so the new node can reindex your wallet.

@_date: 2017-08-21 03:17:01
Investigate Child-pays-for-parent (CPFP). If the change is going back to an address you control you can spend a higher fee with that to get both transactions confirmed.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:29:35
Thanks. I think that fully answers that for me.
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:36:40
You need to pay a fee to the miners to include your transaction in a block. All wallets thus will add a fee (goes to miners, not the developers of the wallet). Normally you can play with the amount but if it's too low it will take longer for a miner to add it or will be rejected entirely.
@_date: 2019-03-28 09:38:53
Here's mine from a while ago. See if you can spot the price back then.
@_date: 2016-06-20 05:26:13
Agreed. However I was talking about the spirit of where the 'data' is stored. Should every node on earth suddenly disappear then no 'coins' would exist unless a node existed on the ISS. Hence, to 'physically send them' you need a ledger yourself.
I agree they don't need one and that no coins actually move between devices.

Most likely not. The exchange will know but if you send slightly different amounts then it will be fairly hard to tell to an outsider observer.

It depends on the site. Its possible they batch the withdrawals to either keep transaction fee's down or its easier (and safer for them) to run the withdraw at specific times or by manually approving them.
Bitcoin itself will confirm within 10 minutes on average given an appropriate transaction fee.
Edit: Also, maybe don't post the TXId if it came to or from coinbase. They watch these forums too ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:47:57
I was tempted to do the same thing in case the miners used the same address on both sides and if there was anything in common. There is some mining shenanigans going on there.
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:30:38
Sure. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:45:17
Anyone got a PR on this with technical discussion?
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:49:16
Yes. As soon as Segwit was activated and enforced by most nodes they became safe. Before that time, all the nodes (including segwit aware ones) would have accepted the "anyone-can-spend" and ignored the witness data (as it would not yet be valid).
The one saving grace is that only a miner could have spent it as nodes will not pass on such a transaction and I think its somewhat difficult (if not impossible?) to know if a P2SH is in fact a P2SH-P2WPKH.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:08:15
That's the strength of open source.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:42:17
If you don't need it urgently, just use a low fee. I used 10sat/byte to move between wallet knowing it would take a while to confirm (About 45 minutes in my case, which actually wasn't bad).
I ignore the fee setting in the wallets and use  . I then pick a fee based roughly on how quickly I want my stuff to go in.
This is actually one of the reasons I'm looking forward to payment channels of some kind to come into existence. It removes the fee market from the equation as the channel will have a likely fixed known fee and guarantee of transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:55:40

And finally, even if you ignore crypto entirely, its always a good idea to DCA towards stuff you want to buy. It allows one to plan. I have seperate wallets for saving for each of my kids school fee's, our holidays, another one for replacing all my servers every 5 years etc etc etc.

That is correct. The reason it breaks here is that blockchain.info is using the public key plus a bit extra as a private key. The fault is in their code.
It's like me saying... Give me your public key. Now I'm going to use maths on it as if it was a private key and derive a new public key from that.
Whilst Coinbase stuffed up, it's blockchain.info that has the greater fault here.

Dogecoin uses a BitTorrent seed for their new nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:27:50
It should be. It doesn't require anything special but just needs you to be aware of how it works.
So looking at your transaction I see 0.00859026 btc going to one address and 0.01241606 going to another. Assuming the second is the change and its going back to you then you just need to create a new transaction, to yourself, that spends that particular change, and put a fee on it that's about twice as high as you would normally pay for a transaction to confirm.
The idea is that a miner will include that transaction, and will have to include the previous transaction as well as it has an unconfirmed parent transaction. The side effect is that it pushes everything through.

Another option is to perform a snapshot of the filesystem and then backup that snapshot. For example if your're under ZFS you can perform a cheap snapshot then directly back up that snapshot at your leisure.

Litecoin P2SH addresses used to start with 3 like Bitcoin. So when Trezor generated a P2SH-P2WPKH address it encoded with a 3 which was accepted by the Bitcoin network as a valid address.
Up until Segwit was activated that transaction could have been stolen by a miner if they were aware of it. Afterwards it became spendable.
Quite an interesting issue and probably one that is going to be seen between BCH and BTC as well since they share the same versioning as well. Unlike this case, if someone were to accidently send to a Segwit address but on the BCH side, then their funds are only recoverable if a miner is asked (and trusted to) include them.
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:19:04
No-one is answering so I'll try.
I have 2xS7 miners. They hash at a total rate of 8TH/s. I use solar power to run them free. I make about $50 p/w and thats dropping fast.
An S9 costs about $1200USD and hashes at 12TH/s. The sheer amount of power it draws will be your major cost plus having to repair it. Plus its noisy. VERY NOISY.
Think about mining as a way of buying bitcoins from your power company slowly and quite possibly at a huge loss.

If you think you seriously have 300 coins, then you would need to do the following: -
* Immediately take those drives and keep them safe

You can't mine Bitcoin with only a gpu now. That was 5 years ago. You need to buy expensive ASICS. And electricity will be the real cost. It's a bit like buying Bitcoins through your electricity company. Cheaper and easier to just buy the Bitcoins itself.

I believe tether is a coloured coin, so the actual BTC worth is lets say 11c, but to someone who understands what the tokens are they are worth $4300.
You'll need to talk to coinbase and ask them to send back the EXACT same tokens sent to you, and hope that it wasn't sent to someone else already. I'm not even sure they will be know how to split it out for you or not. Otherwise you'll have to consider it a donation to the guys who run tether.

All bitcoin addresses already exist. The act of generating a paper wallet is basically just you picking a random number out of a hat and saying 'That is MY number', and writing it down so you don't forget it.

@_date: 2016-12-06 07:39:03
I've not used the ViaBTC accelerator (actually I just can't wrap my head around the fact they are kicking out higher fee's for lower fee's thus just causing the problem for a different group of people, but that's another story...) but I assume 'Jump Succeed' just means its been prioritised. Next time Via themselves solve a block they will then include your block, but as they only have 5% of the total hash they average a block an hour.
Without change, and without access to the sent funds (which is the other way t increase the fee), the only other option is to double-spend, which requires some seriously non-friendly hackery (explained by someone else in this thread).
If it makes you feel any better, I recently had to send a transaction that had lots and lots of small transactions inside it. Total fee to me was $9.
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:19:25
Its quite possible you are correct. I think we will know more in November around the 2X activation time, and more importantly when the BCH devs bring something new to the table as it will be proving ground for them. Its easy to fork something but far harder to innovate.
For me, 10% risk-to-reward means I'd rather hold onto mine and take a see-how-it-goes approach. At the very least it provides a good testing ground for stuff that didn't make it into Bitcoin and a good psychological experiment. 
The who idea of a code fork is that both sides of a fork can cherry pick the good stuff out the other side. If one ignores all the yelling and FUDing then its entirely possible that BCH devs could introduce something useful that can be merged to Core for example. Or it can serve as an example of what not to do. Both are equally good lessons.

I would not assume a pin is safe. If someone has physical access to your device they can do a backup or even an adb Shell and come at the data direct. (Depends on if its rooted and unlocked etc etc)
Use a hardware wallet for serious funds and keep the pin for play funds.

Without going too much into the details, it can be easily recovered with the original public key. I've reproduced this on my own system.

Its not entirely Coinbase's fault. They've having to play by the rules of regulation and US is very strict on gambling. They will cancel a person's account rather than risk going against regulation. This is even if you're not an US citizen.
Normal rule of thumb is to transfer to your wallet, then and only then transfer to gambling site. It really depends on how many hops away they check.
And yes, it sucks.

Thanks. That will help answer that question for me. That is, that a full state is not needed as what is stored in a pruned node is enough to generate all the history of that coin in sufficient detail that we know it was not double spent or conjoured out of nothing.
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:47:40
Personally I think banks have an important role to play in digital currency and it surprises me none really are trying to embrace Bitcoin ahead of their competitors instead of inventing their own implementation.
Most people don't want to be their own bank. They want withdraw limits and Sms 2fa and want to be able to name their accounts and see them on other devices etc etc. So a bank should just be the holder of one of a 3 of 2 key multisig wallet. You then set your daily withdraw limits and other factors, then the bank only signs based upon those rules (ie using Sms 2fa). 3rd key is kept yourself for trust reasons if you want to skip the bank.)
Sorry, probably not totally relevant to your reply but on my mind. I may just go and program it one of these days.

I now understand the reasoning why segwit may be needed since the address you have was originally generated on your litecoin wallet and thus likely requires segwit to redeem it. So unfortunately I think this will require waiting for it to activate here. So I'm sorry we couldn't get it yet, but I'm pretty sure its not lost.

What if you pay a fee and the block gets confirmed by another miner. The wrong miner gets compensated.
@_date: 2016-12-02 00:41:10
Sounds perfect then. You'll get it through eventually.
It means the fee to transfer is smaller than currently pending transactions will will end up in a block once a miner has space to include it.
If you urgently need it you may want to try 'Child pays for parent', where you spend the unconfirmed funds by sending to another address you own, but with a larger fee to cover both that transaction and the pending one (the miners will then include both transactions, assuming the fee beats the others in the queue). Otherwise once you see the 'receiving number USD' in Mycellium you can be (mostly) certain it will eventually arrive.
I'll add that once Mycellium notices the unconfirmed transaction, it will immediately show the next address for the next payment. So thats why when you look at it you'll see the address is different to what's in your email. There is a way to find out all the 'used' addresses in Mycellium but I'm not 100% sure how (I say used, because those addresses can still be used to accept incoming funds, but for privacy reasons Mycellium will show a new address for each new transaction).
@_date: 2016-11-02 05:08:57
Interesting thought. What date would transaction fees match that of the block reward. That seems like an important milestone.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:32:07
Testnet is way way longer than both chains. That does not make it the stronger chain. It's the cumulative proof of work in those blocks. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:03:29
I'll answer this one myself. It appears that a so called 'anyone-can-spend' UTXO's cannot be relayed across the network. I believe it would require a miner to directly mine it. 
In this case, what is to stop a miner, before segwit activates, quickly scanning the whole blockchain for these sort of mistakes and taking them all? (And I assume as they are lower than segwit activation block height it would still be valid after?)

That's right, the EDA itself allows one to mine a lower difficulty block. Therefore if you wanted to get RID of the EDA and just mine higher difficulty blocks then it would be permitted as all the EDA enforcing nodes would accept a higher difficulty mined block as well as a lower difficulty one and all the new 'EDA-removed' nodes would reject a lower difficulty block and ONLY accept the higher difficulty ones.
Therefore its a soft-fork to remove the EDA. And a hard-fork to add an EDA or one that goes the other way as well.
Does that sound right?
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:54:36
Ok, that page generates the addresses in the new format (note that the Public Keys start with L, not 3), so you would need to do different steps. They're the same addresses, just encoded with a different version.
So we first need to find out which one of those public keys is equivalent to your one starting with 3. Then you'll have the private key (starting with T) that can be converted to a bitcoin suitable key with a slightly modified set of my steps.
So assuming out of my bunch of keys from that site I have the following:
    Address: LMAZsSFdGaErDjhxXEXz6kddtxzgjeCsZ8
    Private: T8uejYtWBzr9z6hK2zDGRSwy41HEKdbcSChLosYEj8id1GUV7h99
The code to convert from the 'L' public key to the '3' public key would be as follows:
    python
    import addrgen
    # This is the new-style public key
    ltc_key='LMAZsSFdGaErDjhxXEXz6kddtxzgjeCsZ8' 
    # This decodes to a raw public key
    raw_key=addrgen.base58_check_decode(private_key, 48)     
    # This re-encodes it to a LTC old-style public key
    old_ltc_key=addrgen.base58_check_encode(raw_key, 5) 
    print(old_ltc_key)  # This prints '33ddXmSEjpKB46iEUCDHFMvoqGv8BPbPT4' for my key
So you'll need to do the above for each public key in that list of addresses UNTIL you get the '3' style address that matches the one you sent to. Assuming I've not made a mistake of course.
Then, once you have that, you now need to convert the 'T' private key to a BTC key. The program for that is similarish to the one I sent previous with minor changes to the version:
    python
    import addrgen
    # This is the private key from above
    private_key='T8uejYtWBzr9z6hK2zDGRSwy41HEKdbcSChLosYEj8id1GUV7h99' 
    # This decodes to a raw key
    raw_key=addrgen.base58_check_decode(private_key, 128+48)     
    # This re-encodes it to a BTC private key
    btc_key=addrgen.base58_check_encode(raw_key, 128) 
    print(btc_key)  # This prints 'L35PHobKncsZDG4SVMGQD6Qb79dvFYaiczo5x4uhAAYTVNstaa1o' for my key
Good luck :)

Unless you had 51% (or perhaps a tad more, I can't work out the maths on it right now) you'd constantly orphan.
If you had enough hash power you could totally ignore everyone else and just keep building on your chain secure in the knowledge that you would orphan everyone else.

I have 2 antminer s7 that I run on solar in my shed. I use nicehash to sell my hashing power to and get paid in btc for that. I make about $7US per day.
That's running at 8-9TH/s
If you want to mine with a gpu, check out Ethereum and Zcash. An RX470 gets you about $2US per day, so some people have rigs of 6 of them. I mine them via nicehash as well as id rather get paid in btc and not in the coin I have no faith in.
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:59:56
As a fellow miner if you have lots of small transactions they will combined raise the fee dramatically. I had a $28 fee for $500 worth of BTC until I updated my settings so I got paid less often.
I avoided the fees by providing liquidity to JoinMarket for a week so others paid the fees for me :)

@_date: 2017-08-03 09:33:04
Ok, I've been doing some reading (I'm trying to learn the lower levels of this stuff and this seems like a good way to do it ;-).
Anyway, I looked up your address and see that it has two transactions to it as you describe. They are Pay-To-Script-Hash (P2SH), so we would need to build a redeem script that will allow you to spend that. So I'm just working out the easiest way to create a redeem script that you can try with your private key and hopefully have access.
I'm convinced Segwit is not needed. Litecoin itself uses segwit but you sent it (accidently) from your BTC wallet to a BTC address so it would not be encoded with a segwit transaction.
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:45:45
If you have a hardware wallet like a Trezor, it will sign and show you the transaction. As it's unlikely to itself have malware on it you can be sure of the authenticity even if you don't trust your pc or phone.

My guess is that there will be a surge in the beginning. There are donation funds that are largish that could be used to pump hashes towards it (depends if they buy a whole lot early or spread it out).

Really unsure here. There's a lot of hype around zcash but my feeling is that it will only go down in value. I mine it only for btc.
Having said that, I was really skeptical of the Ethereum premine (and still am mostly) and ICO but those who bought at that time made bank. However as a coder the technicals of Ether are interesting to me, less so the currency.
It all comes back to gambling. Btc is a gamble too but I have huge faith it will last, warts and all, and I think it's hard to understand or appreciate how much value the sheer amount of hashing POW is in the btc blockchain and how it's that that gives it some value. Alts seem to come with a promise and go, whatever the intention of their creators.

I recommend that if you are keeping any significant amount in Bitcoin that you invest in a hardware wallet. Like a Trezor or a Ledger. This device holds the private key and will sign any transactions you make. That way if someone steals your device and/or hardware wallet they still have no access to your funds.
Being your own bank is tricky.

There's a small chance a fork could double your btc as well. When Ethereum forked from Classic all prefork coins existed in both chains and with careful transactions could be traded independently.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:30:13
What I mean, is create a brand new wallet in electrum. Just like you would be starting fresh. It will generate a new seed for you that you don't really need to keep for longer than you need to and you will have a single empty starting address in it.
Then go to Wallet menu -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Sweep, and enter in the private key that you want to sweep from. This should then pull everything into your existing empty wallet. If that works, then send it to wherever you like.
After doing some reading I also see that electrum allows you to 'restore' with just a few private keys as described [here]( instead of having to create a fresh wallet first so that may be another option (if that wasn't what you tried before) as that can save one round of transaction fee's.
If you still have some issues, find an empty private key that you're happy to burn and send it here and I'll attempt to get it imported my side ;)
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:22:18

On my 5KW solar system, I run 2 S7's and get a princely USD$5 per day for my effort. Its probably closer to $2 once I factor in power during the night hours.
I use it as I get a (very slightly) better return by mining (to a joinmarket wallet, which then gets something like 1% interest by providing liquidity) than by selling my power back to the grid for a measly 7c per KW/h.

Actually there is one other way.
Most of the random-ware viruses are 0-conf on the ransom (that I've seen so far anyway). So you could try paying the ransom with a ridiculously low fee, grab the decryption key they send back, then double spend it to another address.
@_date: 2016-11-01 01:10:28
I must still respectfully disagree but this is my own opinion here.
When I go to a website and purchase something, I will always choose the paypal option over the credit card option. If there is no paypal option I will stop and have to decide whether I want to put my CC through yet another service and will be more reluctant to proceed.
The simple fact is that if PayPal protects the buyer over the seller, than as the buyer I will bank on that protection. It sucks for the seller (I am also a seller and *loath* PayPal with all my desire in that capacity) but its the devil I know.
@_date: 2016-12-06 07:12:37
Two ways. Try submit it through the ViaBTC accelerator. It allows you to 'jump the queue'.
Other option is to increase your fee by spending the change you got back (if any) with double the fee.

I'll be honest. If I was a random person who knew nothing about Bitcoin, and someone said they would give me $10 of bitcoin or a $5 note right then, I would first think they're crazy, and take the cash money.
In this case you're directly comparing and competing with something already known (and trusted). But giving it away like the poster above me said via QR codes... that's something you can't do with money. 
Perfect example. One of my passions is to teach kids to read, but my biggest obstacle is trying to get them to read at home. One thing I do is buy them books, but what I'd like to do is go a step further. Perhaps a series of questions they need to solve (by reading the book), which when put together unlocks a bitcoin QR address as a reward. Its the hook that will get them to read at home independently, as well as introduce funny internet money.

I don't think they will confiscate the $25. They should return it no matter what as it belongs to you.
If they cancel the account due to breach of terms they will generally just cancel your ability to buy/sell. You can still withdraw. So your issue sounds like something other than a TOS breach and I was just warning you to be careful if/when you chase it up with coinbase (as in, choose your words carefully ;-).

Very similar. I've had long chats with lots of people over the last few years. Anyone I feel is showing more than a passing interest I always send $5.

@_date: 2016-12-06 03:07:55
Do you mean, if I were to transfer you 100 bits, you are able to store it on your phone?
Yes, but not quite in the way you think.
If you imagine the bitcoin blockchain as a big excel spreadsheet, what you store on your phone is basically a key that allows you to unlock one of the cells on that spread sheet. So if you have 100bits sitting inside your cell on this spreadsheet, you can use your key to instruct the world that you want to take a certain amount out and send to another cell.
This spreadsheet is held across all the full nodes that are on the internet and not actually stored on your phone.
So, what this means it that the ONLY data on your phone is your private keys to unlock those cells. This is stored as securely as possible to prevent other applications from stealing those keys. So if you have a modern phone and appropriate software it will store them in a part of the phone that is secure even from a highly privileged application.
I hope that maybe answers your question.
Note: You can also export your private keys to wherever you like. For example, to a text file on your SD card, or even to the screen so you can write them down on a piece of paper. This way you can enter them in onto any other device and gain access to your funds again.
@_date: 2016-11-23 00:13:17
As long as other people pay a higher fee, their transactions will beat yours. I'm still a little undecided how I feel about this but honestly there is probably no other fair option. As everyone else has said you can remain confident that your coins are secure. 
There are tricks you might be able to perform to bump your your fee's up but unless you're desperately wanting them just wait a couple of days and you'll be good.

Ok, I decided to give it a shot myself. I generated an old-style Litecoin P2SH address (Version 5) and got the following:
    Public Key: 3M1x9HvUbDYpiTjWXoVwUBMxCzVdMj1uNn
    Private Key: LhWFmNGaJs55G9gxhCiMoGi5Y74UqZzbFhqshgX5xtg6B84Em1vB
I first tried to create a new electrum wallet using that private key, and then also tried to create a fresh wallet and sweep the funds. Electrum wouldn't let me so its checking the version on the private key (which is currently 133 as a Litecoin private key).
So I then needed to convert it to a Bitcoin private key, which is version 128. As I'm lazy I downloaded a minimal python address generator from: 
I then, in the folder those files were, did the following: -
    python
    import addrgen
    
    # This is the private key from above
    private_key='LhWFmNGaJs55G9gxhCiMoGi5Y74UqZzbFhqshgX5xtg6B84Em1vB' 
    
    # This decodes to a raw key
    raw_key=addrgen.base58_check_decode(private_key, 128+5)     
    
    # This re-encodes it to a BTC private key
    btc_key=addrgen.base58_check_encode(raw_key, 128) 
    print(btc_key)  # This prints 'Kxc6uZU5S6VPPZd7vpjtpQEeHw4DfUdxSVjDuQncWVuXmU6y9B7Y' for my key
I then entered that private key in electrum and it worked fine.
NOTE to anyone who sees this later. Be wary about putting private keys that contain funds into unknown software (IE, the addrgen  program above) without looking at the code first. If you're worried, do it on an offline machine (after downloading everything first of course).

I'm not too sure what you mean. If you mean, is there a wallet app that you can transfer bits into (bits being a denomination of bitcoin) then, sure, there are lots, but you don't actually store them on the phone. The only thing stored on your phone is the private key that allows you to 'access' them on the blockchain.

It's a nicehash zcash miner. It will have the btc wallet address. If you look that up on nicehash it may tell you how many other workers there are. No private keys will be stored.
Check who is the owner of the file. If it's admin and youre the only IT then be more worried (as I assume by this post it's not yours). I've heard of shady people in IT who mined on their clients machines as for a few days it was possible to get $100 per day mining with 100 machines.
@_date: 2016-11-03 09:26:28
Here's a real example. I mine on 3 antminer S7 that cost maybe $400 each. And I mine on 33 PCs for Zcash. I get about $9 per day from bitcoin, and $60 per day from Zcash, and I totally expect Zcash to drop in the very near future when everyone stops being crazy.

Good point but that assumes they are getting consistent b!ocks otherwise their transactions only either just affect themselves, or they risk paying those fees to another miner.

Sounds like you need to use a custom derivation path per customer. Generally this will appear like separate accounts depending on the software.
Your method by using addresses to separate them is not recommended. The terminology you are looking for is "gap size" which defines how many empty addressed to scan past for non zero UTXOs (otherwise the app will never know when to stop looking)
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:29:31
Very dodgy. Either you will get scammed or you are being used as a buffer between the scammer and their victims.
Example: Date scammer convinces their victim that they are caught up in legal business and need them to deposit in cash sums of money into local bank accounts. 
Victim deposits it to your account, who then in turn buys bitcoin and sends it to the anonymous scammer.
Victim eventually finds they've been duped so they contact the police and give them all the accounts they deposited to. The police freeze the account and then will come chasing you. Scammer is no-where to be found.
This is a real scam that I've been active in tracing for a client that I'm describing above NOT a theoretical one.
If it's too good to be true it generally is.

This does raise an interesting point. Malware could trivially change the address or qr you look at instead of the clipboard. This defeats a hardware wallet.

They can reverse a PayPal payment easily. You can't reverse a bitcoin payment. Only way to be sure is you have to wait past the 45 days or so PayPal gives people to dispute and only then release the bitcoins. I don't think anyone will wait that long.

Correct. The main advantage is that you don't need to trust your machine as much to be malware free but you do need to trust the hardware wallet software. Most of them have open source code so in theory that should help a little by having many eyes on it.

Not worth it. You need special hardware now to mine. An antminer s9 is about $3000 and will net you about $2 per day... Maybe.

@_date: 2016-12-23 08:43:23
This may be a bit too complicated for you, but you may want to attempt to double-spend the funds to the ransomer. That is, spend it initially with a very low fee, and if they accept it 0-conf and send the decryption key you can respend it with a higher fee to an address you own.
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:48:35
An antminer s7 which is highly specialized equipment costs about $300 and will earn about $2 per day. A PC will get nothing. Perhaps with a truly awesome GPU you could mine Ethereum at about 90c per day (using an Rx 470)

I'll just add that sending more than once to the same address has no impact on security.

The former. You do NOT want a private key (I assume you mean  I seed here as you can't import  a private key to hw wallet) from a wallet being imported into a hardware wallet. Totally negates the point of using one. @_date: 2016-11-06 23:58:38
Tin foil aside, I don't really trust desktops and mobiles with significant amounts of money. And that's from someone who runs 100% Linux. So I recommend in addition to whatever wallet you choose that you also get a hardware wallet. I personally use a Ledger unplugged. It's well supported by many wallets.
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:14:58
As long as there is no bug your hardware wallet can't be broken into easily.
Basically the computer says "I want to send X amount to Y address" and passes that to the hardware wallet. The hardware wallet then will ask you itself to confirm and if so will sign it. At no stage is the private keys sent to the computer and you independently verify it on a separate device.

My server is an old diskless IBM X series running proxmox with storage on NFS which is provided by an old dell R710 running zfs with full disk encryption.
I'm surprised it was as fast as it was. Totally thought IO would be my bottleneck and it probably was but memory got sucked up big time. Giving lots of memory during sync helps a lot. 
I've now reduced memory allocation to 5gb and probably could go lower as it doesn't need so much after the full sync.
This is compared with my dev ETH node that just sucks up CPU, disk and memory constantly to the point I'm seriously thinking of enabling pruning (I'm loath to do that, they have few enough non centralised full nodes as it is), throttling it's CPU/memory usage or shutting it down entirely.

You could transact from mars, but you could not mine (orphan rate would be terrible), and running a full node would be... tricky.

I'm actually interested in how bluewallet works. It's custodial but you can run the custodial part yourself instead so I'm thinking it may be a good option where I run that for my family and we all share the channels then (with the software managing who actually owns what).
Also looking at Breez wallet that seems to be totally non custodial but I have some similar concerns to yours about having too many channels or how to keep them in balance since as an individual I would have far less traffic than as a group.
Certainly early times though and I'm quite excited by how these different implementations are going. Enough so to start opening some channels anyway.

Yes. An interesting thread but dangerous as the seller could at anytime bribe the purchaser by saying they'll sign a message showing they have ownership. If they're smart they could sign a message then take a checksum and place it into the blockchain to future prove they had it first. It would not be a good option for anyone to pursue when a court case puts you in a position of weakness.
@_date: 2016-11-10 22:21:38
The hash actually is one of the most interesting parts. It represents a Proof-of-work. It means that if someone wanted to change past transactions they would need to generate a new hash for each changed block, and to do this they would need a similar amount of hashing power as all the miners who attempted to mine those blocks. This would be incredibly difficult and expensive and will get more and more difficult the more hashing power is added to the network.
It's what gives Bitcoin it's 'value' as we can trust that transactions are not easy to change.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:13:16
Hashing power doesn't affect this.

This is actually a weakness of BCH with its checkpoints and DA though this particular scenario is tricky to pull off since people will notice and perform manual intervention (which is a fail still).
Let's assume somehow you manage to split the network so the chain grows on both sides till both hit the length of check-pointing.  You now have two chains that will reject each other and yet share transactions which taint their history.  This is not a scenario anyone wins in.

What about failing the load if its unable to bind at all but expecting to. Ie, ipv4 available but an already bound port found, same for IPv6.
Defaults to bind 0.0.0.0 so fail if all ips including local host are already bound. Requires explicitly setting ips and ports if you have multiple running daemons.
This only solves a proxy but it would be trivial for a client to detect if it's not communicating with an authorised host then.

Yep that explains the huge transaction then. I have a similar setup. I changed my mining payout to be larger but another (probably bad) option is point your miner payout directly to an exchange deposit address. Then it's their problem.
Another option is to setup a yield generator for joinmarket and set it to aggressively combine utxos. Then the users of the market pay you to combine your utxos.
Couple of suggestions. At the very least import your private key into electrum and use it to combine your utxos during the weekend with ultra low fees like 5sat/byte or 10sat/byte (by sending them all to yourself in one shot).
$75 is like 1.5 weeks of mining.

Anything is possible. However those that are not scams or money grabs are exploring other methods of consensus that are interesting to observe which won't improve from being a side chain. 
Those that only concentrate on being a faster and cheaper Bitcoin only will almost certainly have a problem when either a sidechain (unlikely) or secondary layer (more likely) becomes very usable which is also why there is so much angst against lightning from Alts when they compare their own centralised compromises against a much more complex and imho more interesting method of how to perform it in a truely decentralized and permissionless way.

If you run a full node or the software you use runs a full node (ie an exchange) then what will happen is all the shenanigans will be invisible. The nodes will reject any blocks that are in any way invalid.
This means it will just look like the Bitcoin chain is running slower. Even with only 30% hash rate it will hit redifficulty adjustment within 40-60 days.
How long do you think the miners will mine a chain that has $500x12.5 block reward when they have a tasty 7000x12.5 + fees if they mine the other chain?
Finally, as a user you do not need to risk anything. Just hold coins on all the forks. Then you win no matter what.
Edit: I just remember this link was about miners flocking to BCH so it's possible you don't have BCH. It's not going to happen. Not going to happen. They had one chance, right at the beginning when the forks were uncertain. They blew it. And whilst I think some of the various devs are smart and I can respect some of their work they have not yet shown me once they have a grasp of the game theory behind Bitcoin.
I wish BCH all the luck once they sort their shit out. Their eda problems are fascinating to watch and I'm eager to see how the various difficulty changes work purely out of technical interest... But there is no way in hell I would put my life savings into it. It would have to be stable for years to even have a remote chance of that.

I design such systems. It really depends on what particular issues they had and how modulized each part of their system is. For example their frontend could be seperate to the trading engine and be horizontilly or vertically scaled independently.
Also there may be business rules that slow down certain actions that will not be affected by scaling.
Basically, it's probably a lot trickier than spinning up another docker instance.

Either case, you will have to serialize the transactions? If a transaction spends the output of another transaction you will need to delay it to the next block in this case because you can't guarantee it will be ordered afterwards.

In Australia you can pay bills (including your tax) using Bitcoin through a few services. Technically the service just converts to fiat and direct pays the recipient but it allows a direct btc payment for us.
More interesting is that payments like this do not seem to attract a capital gains tax as long as the price is below $10k.

Bitcoin has a history of security. Ethereum has had many issues (multisig contract with bugs causing people to lose money in multisig, the DAO debarkle, how the evm defaults to public variables...). 
Simple fact is that I like how things are built in ethereum and look forward to RSK and ZEN bringing them to btc in a secure fashion (on their own side chain) but till a more secure crypto comes along I will trade and use ether but never store my funds in it.
Some great projects in devcon3 so I do follow the space and I am a developer myself.
Edit: I'll add that apart from the fairly insecure evm, those issues were in contracts and not in ethereum itself. That's my issue. The contracts extends the risk from just the protocol to a far far bigger attack surface.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:30:06
Thanks. I had no idea you could filter out the low fee transactions. Completely changes how it looks.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:41:13
It has some limitations in that it breaks transaction ordering. This will need to be solved in an efficient manner as well as having to provide that ordering info removes most of the savings.
It may be more useful for a method that does not rely on ordering (mimblewimble maybe?).
One also wonders what happens when a miner privately adds transactions directly to a block without broadcasting and what happens when different mempool settings are used.

My one question is to do with the half custodial option.
How can a user trust that in the future ledger does not put in hidden outputs? Does the display show this fact?
My concern is if you can add outputs to a future transaction that for arguments sake sends all the change to your address... The display still showing the correct amount and correct dest address.

That's an opt-in standard so in theory only takes space when used. I kinda like it (having height plus hash guarantees uniqueness on a chain).
As a soft fork it would have to replace a NOP so how do you account for old nodes? You'd need to consume the hash you pushed on somehow? Or would the extra data on the stack just be ignored?

I transferred btc into Bitcoin builder but lost my nerve and transferred it back off. Best decision of my life.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:40:43
When btc is withdrawn from Gemini they broadcast the transaction out and email to tell you. So the email means it's already sent and theres nothing anyone can do to recover it.
The best thing you can do is find out how someone was able to log into your account. Your password may have been compromised by a virus on your PC.
There's a small chance the email itself is fake so check that your balance on Gemini reflects the withdrawal (and don't click any links in the email).
And enable 2fa. With that enabled, even if someone steals your password they cant withdraw because they need the 2fa code to do it.

A simple transaction is irreversible. Andreas calls it a hard promise.
However Bitcoin is programmable money so it's quite possible to create a transaction that can be spent back to you after a period of time or requires multiple signatures to spend. Not many wallets support this yet but Bitcoin itself does and these solutions will make it into easy to use tools.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:22:17
Doesn't matter if the price changes. It's the difficulty you need to be aware of. If the difficulty remained constant (it won't) then 0.25 at 7K is the same as 0.25 at $1M.
However it's more that you'll earn less over time because the difficulty jumps up as more miners enter the game.

@_date: 2017-11-28 00:59:55
The 5 days is to protect coinbase. Your bank transfer is reversible so if they gave it to you immediately you could withdraw the btc, then call your bank and reverse the charge.
The only reason for the delay is the fact our fiat currency is so reversible. Crypto is fast because is guarantees what you tell it to do (you can make it reversible but then have delays like long confirms, or make it irreversible and send it with few confirms)
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:28:38

Totally agree. It's one reason why I trawl /new in each sub as it's eadier to avoid some of the crap.
Each sub has its own personality. Ethtrader are constantly salty about Bitcoin but not bitter. Btc is almost all Core is bad, BCH the real Bitcoin and constantly wineing about devs. Bitcoin is just meme after meme after meme. BitcoinTechnology is a ghost town and BitcoinMarkets is pretty decent if you like triangles.
Out of them all the two trader ones are most readable (I do feel sorry for the eth guys sometimes, Bitcoin just keeps crashing its boot down on them). Btc just depresses and generally sickens me and Bitcoin feels a little forced but at least is readable and can be interesting sometimes.

@_date: 2017-11-15 01:18:40
It's an odd move. Targetting low fees only does not reduce the fees at all.
There are some sites that offer an acceleration service generally by paying separately but that's a large number of low fee transactions to disappear.
My only conclusion is that it's a miner clearing up their own transactions (though once again it's odd as they would then lose out on the high fee ones). It doesn't really make rational sense unless a miner was trying to help (an irrational decision but certainly a human one)

If you have 2fa enabled then this brings it to a whole new level. Please keep us updated on your results.
I've checked your transaction. Here is a link to a block explorer with your transaction (careful once again with links as you don't know me): 
You can also open blockchain.info and paste in your transaction Id there to look it up on the blockchain (it will be the same page).
It tells me 1.16btc with 10 confirms is sent. There is no way to reverse this even for Gemini.
Now the big question is how it happened with 2fa enabled.

Yes it sounds pretty annoying in the us. I can see why it's more speculative there because it's just a huge pain to deal with it as a currency right now. Hopefully crypto friendly people get into regulation positions.

@_date: 2017-11-16 07:43:27
I don't think it's a huge issue. The 2016 blocks gives Bitcoin a huge momentum. The BCH difficulty would very quickly rise forcing rational miners to jump back so it's the market price of Bitcoin that is important.
I see BCH as the flea inside an elephants ear. After crossing a bridge the flea says 'boy we shook that bridge up'.
Edit: Like any investment you want people to invest with good reason. The pump on BCH last week was not organic and only tricked users to buy in. Those same users will not hold so you'll notice a slow bleed down, which due to bchs new DAA means they will bleed miner support. So they basically have a scenario where they need to convince the market to hold or spend a lot of money propping it up. In many ways their older eda worked better as it basically bribed the miners to stay and everyone payed for it through inflation (easier pill to swallow since you pay collectively for it). Now only by having personal skin in the game can the miners be tempted to mine the coin. This is far harder to convince users to do.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:24:05
First, I don't condone cp at all obviously but in something neutral like TCP or Bitcoin or even ethereum the protocol itself is neutral and agnostic on everything.
However a smart contract does raise something interesting if it's designed to produce something very wrong and morally illegal on demand and is executed on a node.
I'm feeling a little torn now I guess. What's appropriate here? :( Is this the start of blacklisting...
Edit: on further thought this is actually an excellent argument for seperation of concerns with bitcoin. The underlying protocol is agnostic but the secondary layer (ie rsk) has the human element in. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:02:41

I don't think they added that in the iOS version.
I highly recommend looking for a better wallet and import your keys in there. Then you have more control.
I recommend a hardware wallet like Ledger nano S. It supports custom fees.

Addresses have a checksum so it's hard to send to the wrong address.
However bch uses the same address format but not segwit. Thus if you send to what is a valid segwit address on btc using BCH you can't spend it unless you can convince a miner to directly include it using the anyone-can-spend property.

Don't discount the DAA. It's actually more powerful than it looks. It kills minority chains which means hard forks are difficult but effective when they go through. It also gives Bitcoin huge momentum that you'll note BCH has difficulty attacking (BCH tends to get pulled around by the nose rather than btc).
It also sets interesting game theory of Bitcoin that requires participants to have proper skin in the game.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:40:01
Yes. It's too hard to tell if it will help BCH yet but it removes off the table the bribes to the miners which I think is great for both coins.

I mean filler transactions. A miner can easily put in 0 fee transactions of their own into their own block and just keep doing that to ensure they meet the required level. This takes up useless space on the blockchain.
Also since the miner doesn't have to verify these transactions they can start an 'empty block's with these filler transactions already in.

All full nodes would reject the block and still be waiting for a valid block. Spv wallets could potentially be tricked but it's very unlikely as an spv wallet connects to a full node anyway which would have rejected the block.

No issue with starting small. Just remember that transactions fees do not change based on the amount but on the size of all the transactions. This means you can move $1m for the same price as 50c and so the fee will be a larger percentage of it.

Yes and no. We have to also realise what it is that we have here.
You can see it in the scaling debate. There is a lot of people who blindly want to update things they feel is trivial to drive the price higher. They are profit motivated. But when you start digging underneath and try to plan the future you start to see why some design choices were made and that whilst they may paradoxically appear to hurt the price they actually make the system a safer and more long term bet.
Also, the technology itself is amazing. Just imagine what we can do with it. Check all the innovation across all the cryptos.
But so to will the scams evolve. And because a lot of the system is driven by greed people are going to be sucked in purely in the hopes of short term profit. Look at bitconnect and OneCoin as examples here.

Actually I think that's deliberate. Previously btc was due a difficulty reduction. Now it's a difficulty increase.

I don't think we should rely on the good will of any party. Bitcoin works because we assume everyone is doing it for self interest and don't trust anything. Miners have demonstrated with BCH that short term interest is their primary concern. I myself mine the most profitable chain but I store my funds in the one i consider most secure.
I believe signals through either Coinbase text or version bits are without stake and ultimately meaningless beyond giving an indication of what a miner of a block is considering.

I'm in Australia. We can spend up to $10k without Cgt each time on things like bills. I put my pay into btc but maintain a small bank reserve for credit card purchases.
Most Australian bills have a BPay number that can be used to pay with. What one normally does is log into their bank accounts and generate a BPay payment.
I use a service called livingroomofsatoshi (there are a couple other available as well) that allow you to send crypto and they generate the BPay.
Technically I'm still paying the end user in aud but I hope one day to close that loop and pay directly in btc.

Then they can put whatever fee they like, lets say 100btc fee. They risk nothing because the fee goes to themselves (they don't broadcast the filler transactions so there's no risk another miner will take the fee).

Spv nodes check difficulty so it's a risk of wipeout only if the cumulative pow is higher which will be unlikely (unless a bunch of miners jump).
As soon as the eda kicks in it will create blocks that the current nodes would reject. This is quite ironic as BCH supporters place less faith in the nodes and more in the miners and yet it's their nodes that will protect them.

Amount of the transaction does not change the fee. So a small amount will have a larger fee by comparison and Coinbase deliberately use a high fee to ensure it gets into the next block.

I do not think so. Keyservers will sync between each other using various methods.
Best option is someone who pulled a full dump (about 7.5Gb today) before the dates in question but they would need to also have some method to prove that the dump actually occurred then as well.

I wouldn't pay $1,000 either but I'd instead spend my time working out a way to improve delivery since there is a big slice of pie I could be getting by undercutting in some way.  It drives innovation which otherwise would not be there.
Dragging this analogy back to crypto one could say the innovation is either better improvements on how the space is used or by switching to another crypto that professes to solve the problem.  What is difficult is actually understanding what is compromised with some decisions made by other crypto's and being able to adopt an attitude of envisioning long term instead of pure short term gain.

A single world (universe?) currency like we see in startrek (Latinum, though it's closer to gold) etc will be a much further away target.
Now why lightning?  I actually see services building on top of lightning (or something similar) providing a tertiary layer but I could be wrong there.
Also, some things I think have only a limited lifetime or it will change use over its lifetime.  Bitcoin direct main chain transactions worked well up to a certain size of network but scales badly.  Lightning may also be a temporary technology that will only be improved in the future and will look very different later or be entirely replaced.  However to get there one has to go through the growing phases and each phase needs to support the current use.

If you sent to an address starting with 1 then you should be able to access the funds as the private key with work on both btc and BCH. Will require a little research but no stress.
If it was sent to a segwit address then it's harder. On BCH a segwit transaction is seen as an anyone can spend transaction (BCH ignores the segwit rules) but you need to convince a miner to mine the non standard transaction as you can't broadcast it yourself. There may be a service somewhere that will do this for you. Don't post your address anywhere as it means a BCH miner could just take it though it's also possible for someone to eventually find it so you may only have a limited amount of time.

Sure but if you have a timelocked transaction set for 1 year away no way is it going to hang around in the mempool all that time. You'll need to broadcast it after that time has lapsed.

Yes. Well in the fact that you don't need to worry as much as our US friends do.
According to [this]( using bitcoin as a personal asset does not require reporting the cost basis provided the cost of bitcoin is $10,000 or less.
You will still need to (as a business) keep track of GST. If you accept bitcoin, you report the GST back. If you pay for stuff using Bitcoin, you can claim the GST back. 
Thank heavens we don't need to pay GST on actually buying Bitcoin anymore. That was one disaster avoided.

Whilst not the same as a **bitcoin** physical gold market, I did dabble with Bitgold recently. A client paid me in gold there. I found it incredibly difficult to get those funds out until I cashed it out to my personal account first. I was originally hoping it would be possible to buy, lets say BTC, directly on an exchange with BitGold, perhaps even a BitGold/BTC pair. Sadly not the case.

@_date: 2017-09-27 07:28:56
I think I'm misunderstanding you here.
I thought we were discussing the block size as it could be. That means, assuming Segwit transactions keep rising, we could be looking at maybe 50% segwit 50% legacy. Assuming the blocks are full, that means a total block size of about 5Mb, taking into account block weight.
Assuming all transactions go P2SH and P2SH-P2WPKH due to the discount AND assuming they get slightly more complex, this figure could be even higher. No where near 8Mb but closer to it than 4Mb I reckon.
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:54:43
That is true but if there is even a hint of that occuring I guarantee that you'll see the price bump up quickly.
At the moment, let's say I have $100k in crypto. I need to put that into something that I trust will hold its value or at least not fall too much because I'm in it for the long term. I'm not a speculator nor do I want a 'get rich quick' scheme where I win if someone else's loses out. Right now out of all the Bitcoin forks available there is really only one that stands out.

Let's say you have 10btc on a paper wallet. You now want to spend it so at that point you scan in the private key to spend. Now if your device is compromised you could lose everything on it.
The issue is that without some way to perform offline signing you have to bring your private key on a live device to transact. And that may be find the first 100 times you try but maybe the 101th time you accidentally have a virus on your machine.
Offline signing is one of the most secure ways. To do it you need a device that can do it offline. For most users a hardware wallet will fill that role.

No. Both chains will enforce segwit rules.

We shall see a test of that in the next few months. Do miners have power or do they follow the users.
If S2X wins then it won't be definate (as there may have been a majority of users wanting it for example), but if Segwit wins it will be definate proof that miners merely follow the profits.

This is an archive node so not a good comparison. The extra data does not need to be kept and can be regenerated.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:51:05
The miner themselves can decide which transactions to include in a block. Most rational miners would obviously just pick the highest fee transactions that fits in a block unless they have other reasons for including a transaction (IE, someone paying them directly to include a transaction or a miners own transaction etc etc).
This means that when blocks are full a fee market emerges where only the higher paying transactions will get in and the rest will wait for quieter periods.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:46:22
The average legacy size will be 4Mb. However the Segwit transactions and P2SH transactions in the future (which I'm assuming there will be a lot more of due to its cheaper cost now) will push that figure higher due to Block weight.
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:38:25
I stand corrected ;). Pretty sure my nodes have a minrelay of 1sat by default but I guess I'd better double check that value.

It's a P2SH address. This means that to claim it you need to provide a redeem script. As it's a segwit on a non segwit chain it is technically a anyone-can-spend but a normal node will not relay such a transaction (so it will never reach the mempool of a miner). This means that only a miner can actually generate the transaction directly.
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:10:08
That's all you need to uniquely identify each word.
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:32:25
I'm going to have to dig through the code again and check this. If I was doing it id force a larger block and invalidate a smaller block to provide good 2 way wipeout. I'd rather my chain freeze than risk a wipeout.
Pretty sure BCH did this (remember the controversy when the testnet ABC client paused when it couldn't build a large enough block). It's trivial for a miner to fabricate a large block.
I guess the question is if the nodes enforce that check as well. Something I'm not sure about.
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:46:08
Won't work. You would need to take advantage of the pay-to-anyone which is not relayed by nodes and you couldn't guarantee that someone watching the mempool or a miner themself claiming it. Only way is to convince a miner directly to mine the transaction and trust they don't claim it themselves.

Actually fixing eda could be tricky. They would need to drop the legacy chain and due to eda it will become easier to mine which will incentvise someone with an ASIC to mine it.

First, is anyone going to be buying Bitcoin Gold? I've not actually heard a single person say they want to buy it. You need a buyer to sell it. You also need some place to exchange it.
IMHO I think Bitcoin Gold will be nothing exciting. It is an altcoin that is hoping to get into the top 10 market cap by hitching a ride on Bitcoins own history otherwise it would just be lost amongst the 1000 other altcoins. Its like BCH claiming to be the 3rd largest crypto purely because they inherited the Bitcoin history and thus can multiply their exchange value by the number of coins in existence, but then also say that all their issues are only because they're a 'new coin'. You can't have it both ways.
Anyway. As always, if you control the private keys then you have all the control. So however it pans out, and whatever coins fork off Bitcoin, you will have the choice of what to do if you have a wallet that YOU have the private keys to. If you leave it in an exchange then you will be at their mercy as to whether they will support it or not.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:05:45

Let's say a new bank arises that deals in crypto. They provide their own wallet that will automatically create 2-of-3 multisig accounts. One signature is the bank and the other 2 belong to the customer.
There may be several strategies to store one of the customers keys (including having it stored  a with a 3rd party security  a company) but the other is stored in their wallet.
The customer can now specify that they want a daily limit of, let's say $2000.
Now when they send a transaction their wallet provides one signature and if they are below the limit the bank provides the second.
If the customer loses their key, the other key can be retrieved to recover funds. The customer can also use both their keys to circumvent the bank entirely.
This can also all work on a secondary layer in the same way.
Just some thoughts anyway. The idea is the wallet makes this all very hidden whilst still being fully able to be audited. Stuff like account details can be encrypted with the key and stored with the bank so account names and history/notes will sync between devices.

Make it hard to get in and out (capital controls on the fiat side). It won't stop it but it will drive it enough underground that it will be someone else's problem for the future. It will also mean starting later in the tech race.
Another option seems to be to make it less significant. Generate lots of forks so it gets lost amongst them all. You don't even need your forks to be dominant... Just as long as people talk about it and are distracted from improving the technology.
I think those are less risky than attempting a 51%.

If I honestly knew that then I'd be 100x margin long in that direction and would be tipping people in whole Bitcoins.  I'm not one to sell one side of a fork right away because I could be terribly wrong (and have been plenty of times before).
So right now i look at the market prices and they reflect pretty well my feelings of risk in each coin. And I'll be watching the S2X future tokens like a hawk because they are still an unknown.
I hope BCH pulls itself up. I really hope that community gets a coin that they like. There are so many interesting features that could be explored there that would be impractical on BTC and so it has huge potential. But before that happens BCH is going to need to solve its severely centralized mining and that aweful eda, just as BTC has issues it needs to solve.

@_date: 2017-10-04 12:44:41
I've been looking at this. Bitcoin is a network where you do not and should not trust anyone else. This will only hurt spv clients (which never checked this info anyway, so no change) and only really hurts the minority pool of nodes. This means this only affects the S2X nodes really and apart from using up a bit of extra bandwidth will not adversely affect btc nodes at all.
Sure there is a risk of partitioning but that will affect the few nodes rather than the many. I can't think any btc node will be surrounded by b2x nodes whereas the reverse is true.
This only hurts S2X and I can't understand the reasoning behind it. If I were the conspiracy type I'd almost think Core just pulled off an amazing heist and have managed to convince the S2X devs that by isolating themselves they are disrupting the Bitcoin network.
Why would they choose this path? It doesn't make sense.

Nodes are both the most powerful thing of Bitcoin as well as the least powerful thing. I like to think of them as the pawns on a chess board.
Really useful and important for you to ensure you get transactions that follow the correct rules. Really important for the Economic users (exchanges, merchants), and yet totally useless to spin up hundreds just to bloat the number of nodes count (apart from providing more connection redundancy which I guess is a plus)

Look at BCH. It would take only a small percentage of hash to avoid any EDA's. This would keep the coin stable and not give any other miner any advantage. And yet they still let it drop it less than 3% to encourage an EDA.
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:42:03
That question is hard to answer for the following reasons:
1. Most people on both sides of the fence are vastly unqualified to even discuss what the differences are and just parrot what they heard someone else say. So there is a lot of misinformation resulting from people who try to do the right thing but end up spreading the wrong information. It's a bit like watching my great grandmother talk about the difference between UDP and TCP.
2. Because money is involved people have a vested self interest even if it's entirely subconscious. They will forgive and gloss over weaknesses in the coin of their choice and look for anything that may remotely be an issue in those they don't.
Sorry if that doesn't help but the only way to decide is to do research and try not to pass on wrong information. The market is very smart so the price is often a very good indicator, all else being equal.

The seed allows a wallet through the magic of maths to determine all the private keys in the wallet (and thus the public keys as well). So as long as you've not done something like import a foreign address in you can just the seed to regenerate access to all your funds on another wallet that supports the same standard.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:22:16
The choice is yours. If you think it will drop then go for it. You are taking the same risk as the person on the side of that deal.
I just suggest be careful. It's really hard to trade and consistently get profits. This is because everyone else is also trying.
One thing to try is use pretend money and track your buy sell as if you were doing it for real and see how you feel at the end before using your valuable money.

Any exchange. For example we had one called MtGox that disappeared with over $600M of their customers money. 
I've been hit by a local exchange not allowing its customers to withdraw (igot now called bitlio) and lost over $2k to that (or 5 Bitcoins which hurts more)
However, keep in mind that people are terrible at security. So if you're more concerned about your own security versus counter party risk then store it with a trusted exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:43:41
Its a new change. I never expected all software to support it right out of that gate, especially with all the uncertainty. Why write and test changes that may change at the last second. Also it's always best to let others do the bleeding for you on new software, so many vendors were waiting for the results of early adopters of the change.
The adoption rate is exactly what I'd expect from a change like segwit.

I hear you. And it will just come with experience.

I'll add that when you spend from an address you expose the actual address rather than a hash of it.

I saw that post. I don't think there is much conspiracy and that the upvotes are by people who have a vested self interest in any good news for their coins. That is, they bought the coins and will upvote even the remote chance of good news for it. I see similar things in other crypto forums.
The thing is, a coin needs to stand on its own merits. Simply upvoting news may pull in a few suckers but those will also be the quickest to leave as well.

Unneeded. Also, if I was the conspiracy type I'd say BCH is the incentive not to do so as the hash would all flow there.

Actually quite often.

If you transferred it to a wallet you created you would have a file 'wallet.dat'. if you find that then you may be able to get the keys.
If you did what a lot of people did at the time and purchase on MtGox but left it there on the exchange, then it's all gone as MtGox lost over 600 thousand Bitcoins and is insolvent.

I guess it depends on how you do it. I mine and I make about $50 per week from it. But I run mine from solar only now. When I ran it from power my power bill was nearly $1000 when it normally is $200.
Rigging up power, keeping it cool and dealing with the noise are generally the other big issues.
I don't want to dissuade you. If you're wanting to do it then you can certainly get some profit. But honestly if I bought btc instead of miners at the time I did then i think the btc would itself be worth more.
Having said all that I enjoyed mining as it means experiencing more of the bitcoin experience that generally only early adopters got to be involved in.
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:08:49
Miners signalling nya are not producing invalid blocks (yet). Once they choose a side then their skin is in the game. And they will very quickly flock to the most profitable chain as demonstrated very aptly with BCH.

One thing to be aware of. In general Bitcoin upgrades are done to ensure backwards compatibility especially for these type of transactions.
But in the case of a fork WITH replay protection the time locked transaction may possibly be unspendable on the fork with the protection in place. For example, BCH would have been unspendable.
So just double check that to be sure (I can't quite recall if it affects these types of transactions but I think it might)
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:40:18
I think the market has decided that it has an 8% chance. The market value is one important indicator (not totally reliable however) what the general feeling about any current is, assuming you compare them by market cap. As btc and BCH have similar market caps it shows the market only has 8% faith in it.
Now there may be other factors, like selloffs from Xapo that affect that but I think it's pretty compelling.
The real question is. What are the users of BCH going to do about it?

The issue you are experiencing is the gateway between fiat and Bitcoin.  Once converted you need no permission to send any amount to anyone.
For example your 14day delay is due to the fact the fiat you deposit can be reversed easily whereas you can't reverse a Bitcoin transaction once sent. An easy scam would be to deposit funds, withdraw btc, then reverse the deposit if there was no delay.

One unintended side effect of the eda is that it will be incredibly hard to fix. It requires a hard fork and the eda will keep the old chain running.

You may want to look at other methods if possible, even localbitcoins or a bitcoin ATM.

Keep it in mind as a risk then. Don't store millions on it but small amounts are probably fine. Unfortunately a problem of any wallet developer is that you can't really monetise the wallet itself. Something Ive been grappling with.

The service takes a huge risk.
Sending btc is final.  Once confirmed it cannot be reversed whereas billing the credit card can be reversed for ages after the event.  In order to be risk free the service would need to wait the full length of time for a credit transaction to finalize before sending btc.  This could be 45 days.

I started a few months ago, when it was 25BTC per block reward. Its now 12.5BTC per block.
I've not scored any yet. But I have learned a lot about mining.
I run it on my solar (I have a 5KW system and only use about 0.8KW of it for my whole house) so its essentially free lottery tickets.
Just be aware the mining equipment is  loud. I run it in my shed.

In either case you are fine as you have the private key (and not someone else). In fact you can (though i don't recommend it) have both electrum and ledger both with the same seed and able to access the same funds on the blockchain but it would immediately render the secuuruty of the ledger to the same as electrum.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:04:40
It depends on the size of the transaction itself not the amount. Size is loosely how complex it is.
So it would have cost the same fee for $1 million as for your one.

@_date: 2017-10-26 12:17:16
You're misunderstanding how bitcoin mining works. The block reward in no way influences how hard it is to mine. The difficulty is purely a device enforced through code to keep blocks being solved every 10 minutes. This is a large part of what makes proof of work something valuable... You know when looking at a block that a certain amount of work was done to solve it and thus can be reasonably certain that it was not 'cheaply' made (ie, easily changed with nothing at stake).
If you need to verify that any transaction is valid, then just run a full node and point your wallet to that. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 09:14:16

@_date: 2019-09-05 08:48:31
Whilst I doubt it's deliberate it is a cheap attack vector on a low fee chain. Technically a miner could mine empty blocks or set a minimum transaction they will accept with not much lost opportunity cost.
However, like btc, if you wait long enough someone else will mine a large enough block or the fees will rise till it becomes an expensive attack.

@_date: 2017-10-16 12:18:35
You can't really compare them. An eda was used since BCH and btc share the same type of pow and BCH wanted to survive as a minority chain. 
Satoshis difficulty algorithm is designed so only a majority chain exists as any others would be a menace to the network. Btg does not so will not have the same need. 
For this same reason, only one of B2X or BTC will survive. Any forked version of either chain that diverges from this (ie pow change or eda) ceases to be Bitcoin (imho) and would also become an alt.

At 15TH (3 s7s) I have a 1 in 2000 chance per day of mining a block. One easy way is to use a solo mining pool. Check out

@_date: 2016-10-24 01:34:48
It makes it almost impossible to go back and rewrite history, but until a transaction is confirmed in a block the attacker can double spend by broadcasting a higher fee transaction which is more attractive to the miners.
I sometimes wonder why a transaction with a newer timestamp AND different output address is even accepted (it would be trivial to reject)

@_date: 2017-05-23 09:35:52
I know what backup you mean. Its the older mycellium one that provides an encrypted QR that you scan in, and 15 letter code to fill in as well.
When you created the backup originally mycellium would have presented the letters to you and got you to enter them in (I think, or maybe it just showed them to you). It also had spaces on the page to physically write the letters down.
The bad news. If you don't have those 15 characters then you will be unable to brute force it.
Sorry if you're in this spot. Lesson to others is to always test your backups. This goes for hardware wallets as well... get a second one and make sure you can restore the key (without the key touching a computer) and do a small transaction on the second one.

For anyone else reading this, don't check 16btc balances on a computer, especially a windows PC. Get your xpub key and use that to view balances and only touch private on a secure device (I'll say a phone here due to their better security but they're not perfect either so a hardware wallet is best).
Finally, back to OP. It's an expensive lesson but you'll survive though I can imagine what you're going through as it can shake confidence (I've been stung in a bad trade that shook me up a few years ago). Treat it as a lesson and don't give up.

@_date: 2017-05-15 13:41:21
But how would they compromise? The wallet is not connected to the internet and if you generate your own seed, let's say by rolling dice, then it should still be more secure than storing the seed on your phone.

This is the difference between a 'bucketshop' and an exchange. 
An exchange will allow people to sell bitcoins for USD, lets say, and others to buy bitcoins with USD. All the exchange provides is an orderbook to allow these two groups of people to buy and sell to each other, and it will take a small percentage in fee's to provide this service.
A bucketshop, on the other hand, will buy and sell to you against the current bitcoin price. Its in their best interest to buy low and sell high.

The simple answer is it depends on how much you trust the exchange.
If you transfer out then you have 100% control of your future, but then you need to trust yourself.
If you leave them then you have to accept what the exchange does. I would assume a good exchange would do right by its users but in no way can you know that 100%.

Unfortunately the fee paid was very low so all other transactions with a higher fee (which is pretty much every other one) will be confirmed first. Also any new transactions with a higher fee will jump the queue as well. I paid 130sat per byte for my three transactions today and no doubt knocked yours down the list in the process as mine confirmed ;)
No matter what, you've not lost any coins. It could be they never confirm but that just means you can respend them with a better fee. Good luck.

@_date: 2017-05-05 07:38:17
I'm not sure why you keep coins on an exchange to see their 'worth' TBH. You can just query the exchange without even logging in to see their relative prices. Otherwise check out [BitcoinWisdom]( to get fancy graphs.
However, the risk of losing $1 to counterparty risk is negligible as well.

If you want to trust others then that's perfectly valid. I'd trust a bank that's been running for years over some shady guy in the road who would store my cash in his shoebox... Why because in theory the bank is more easy to be held responsible.
Same with Bitcoin. Those who want to be their own bank can. Those who want to be the bank to others can as well. It's up to the user as to whom they use.
One of my projects I was developing was a wallet that stored 2 of 3 multisig accounts with the account names and transactions stored encrypted on a server. This could potentially be how a Bitcoin bank could safely operate in the future.

I believe electrum stores its data in:
    /data/data/org.electrum.electrum/
(or something like that). So if you can access that (may require root access on device) and do a bit of research you _may_ be able to pull the data out of that. I've done absolutely no research on this so the data could well be encrypted with the PIN in which case you'd need to brute force it but it would be a LOT faster to brute force if you have the data file on a PC.

Ok, I've not researched this at all so take it as it will, but this raises a huge red flag to me.
Lets say you store your 1000 $10 per BTC coins with them. BTC meanwhile skyrockets up to $1000 per coin and now you want to take it all out.
This means they need some way to have made that plus interest, plus extra for profit themselves and if they choose wrong they will be way out of pocket, declare bankruptcy/hack and run away.
This is exactly what happened with MtGox.

If you mean paper wallets then most software will just send the change back to the paper wallet. It reduces security but honestly not that much.

As far as I know they're the same. I don't believe ledger would use multisig so you should be a ok to import just the private key.
Note you will need to get the individual private key. Merely importing the whole wallet using its backup phrase will not work as it uses a different path to generate addresses. Hence why I suggested you import the HD wallet phase into an ltc wallet that then will let you export the single address private key corresponding to that public key you sent to, which you can then import into a btc wallet and sweep it out.
Hope that makes sense. At the end of it you'll be an expert.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:42:07
This is a legitimate issue and not much that can be done apart from being vigilant with the code or more likely being lucky enough not to to be the first one hit.
I believe the attack surface is far smaller though. If you use your desktop as a wallet then potentially any program running on it could compromise a key stored on it. Whereas your key on a hw wallet is only compromised if there is a bug or backdoor in the hw wallet itself.

I actually don't directly mine BTC. I sell my hash to Nicehash instead so I get paid (in BTC) for my hashes. A fixed rate.
If I mined BTC directly, I'd make about $6 per day. By selling it to Nicehash I get paid about $8 per day. That means people buying hashes from there are likely paying a premium for it.

The point is that you can backup your hardware wallet with a piece of paper. In fact you can copy it over and over and over.
And now I know your next question is "But why not just have the paper". The simple answer is that paper wallets are themselves vulnerable. To spend from a paper wallet you have to scan them into your computer/device and so for that brief moment it has full access to the private key. If your device is compromised then you can lose everything on the paper wallet.
A backed up hardware wallet is just a bunch of words. And to restore it you can enter it into a program (with the same risks as a paper wallet) OR you can buy another hardware wallet and enter them in on there (thus preserving the security).
Spending from a hardware wallet never exposes the key to a computer. The computer instead creates the transaction and gets the hardware key to sign it. This way you can see where the transaction is going to, check its for the right amount, without the computer being in control. Assuming you can trust the hardware wallet firmware of course.

I think we are both agreeing with each other, at least I hope we are. 
I'm just adding that it would be more likely a miner that grabs the anyone can spend since they would have first shot of it. If I was a miner I wouldn't include any anyone can spend transactions by anyone else but would instead add them going to myself.

What you're talking about there is a replay attack.
Let's assume a fork occurs and now you have the same coins on both sides. You pay Alice using one chain. Alice can broadcast your transaction on the other chain and get your coins sent from there as well (because it's also technically valid on there)
In no way can a random person just spend your coins due to a fork unless one of the forks loosens the security rules.

Look at whattomine.com
I have 2 antminer s7 with a total rate of 8000gh/s. I sell my hash to nicehash (better rate than directly mining Bitcoin) to make about $8usd per day. If I could run it every day of the year I'd make about $4k, assuming the price of Bitcoin goes up faster than difficulty. However in summer our temperatures hit 45 degrees Celsius so I normally turn them off during summer... Which is sad as it's when my 5kw of solar would really be the most useful.
I spend maybe $1400 in electricity per year.

Here's an example. Let's say you use mycellium as your wallet and the devs go bad and put code in so that they can secretly get your key.
The very next time you try to spend from your paper wallet the app sends the key out and you lose everything. This is because it has to read the private key in and thus it now has that key.
With a hw walket the app asks the wallet to sign the transaction instead. So you can see on the hw wallet screen what is happening and can cancel or approve it. The private key never gets into your phone/PC.

Well, each of your addresses will have a private key and so every transaction (which tends to use another address for change) will have its own key.
You'll need to find the private key for the exact public address you sent to. I'm not too sure how in electrum but if there's any wallet that you can do it in, it will be in that one.

I can't test this but you should be able to export your private key out then import just that key into an ltc wallet.
I'm not sure ledger provides a way to get the private key so you'll need to restore using your bip39 backup phase into another wallet that will allow you to do this. Consider sweeping your wallet first.
Note for anyone else who reads this. This is only possible between btc and ltc due to a shared codebase. Don't assume this will work for pretty much any other coin.

Ok hopefully getting close. I'm no expert at electrum but it sounds like you're trying to create a whole wallet from the single address.
What you need to do is generate a new wallet (which you're not going to really use), open it, then import the single address in. Hopefully that will work and you can then sweep that address.

The only thing on the PC is the private keys to the Bitcoins (sorta).
It's a bit like storing your bank username and password in a text file. Sure you can restore that file later but if someone transfers the funds out first you are (technically) out of luck.
I refuse to type my words into any PC and instead enter them in a special hardware wallet and handwrite my backups. The issue then is trying to protect your backups in a way that someone trusted can restore later.
Some of this stuff may get easier later by sacrificing some of the trustlessness and having a 3rd party involved (like a Bitcoin bank) or through some other clever crypto method.

If you get a hw wallet I suggest (for peace of mind):
1. Set it up as per it's instructions. Part of that is writing down the master seed. Don't transfer anything to it yet.
2. Take note of the initial address (write it down)
3. Reset the hw wallet and go through the steps to restore the master seed.
4. Look again at the initial address and confirm it matches the one you wrote down.
Now you know you can restore it again later and also that you wrote your master seed down right.

If you solve a block then you get the whole reward (assuming solo mining). Some people will solo mine or join a solo-mining pool for the lottery aspect. If you don't solve a block, you get nothing.

An antminer is fucking loud. There is no way you will want to run this for the $50 per week you'd make if electricity was free (which it is not) in an appt or even a house.
So if you really want to mine you need to plan how to handle the noise, how to get sufficient power (my 2x ant7 required me to run two circuits due to their load) and actually plan how to deal with the electricity costs. Because these things suck up a tonne of current and whoever pays the electricity bills will know pretty fast.

I think part of the problem is ethereum uses an account system rather than a utxo. In Bitcoin you can send multiple transactions and they may use different utxo and thus even if one is delayed the other may work, especially if the fee is higher on that one.
Ethereum uses accounts so every transaction must process in order.

First, the vpn itself is probably unrelated. I could be running a dodgy vpn provider but I would have no way of changing the packets that pass through without them becoming invalid. The most a malicious vpn provider could do is block your transactions from happening.
However if you're running software to provide that vpn, or basically running windows at all then it's very hard to prevent something creeping in. I consider myself skilled in security and run a windows desktop ONLY for games and yet somehow my Diablo 3 password got compromised.

I'm working on another project so I can't commit to anything yet. Having said that, it may be worth discussing here so that either on of us, or both together, or someone else who stumbles across it, has something to start with.
A couple of years ago I had an idea for a wallet app + 'bank server' that had some of the features you were describing. It has features that also go outside the scope of your original post but I thought I'd post it here anyway. I started it a couple of years ago but abandoned it when I got caught up with another project and having to deal with Googles ADHD with the Android SDK spec continually bloody changing.
My use case was as follows (going from memory so some of the details may be a little inaccurate):
1. A family account. Each kid with their own HD wallet, with a master key that can view them all. This is similar to your friends idea (and I am also both the gatekeeper and keymaster of several of my friends funds as well so I know the position). I came to the same conclusion as you that you needed at least 2 levels above the standard BIP44 spec.
2. The ability to restore all the names of the accounts + transaction information (ie comments etc on a transaction) easily from a backup.
3. Like a bank, specify a custom daily transaction limit. IE, $1K per day max. Or 0.5 BTC per day.
My idea was to design two components. Both could work independently.
1. A backend server component - This optional component would provide a central server that would have a totally open API and allow access without prejudice to any wallet provider out there (so all its functionality can be added to any other wallet). Its whole purpose was to provide the server component of the wallet needed for some of the functions. It is designed so the server operator (ie, me) has no access to any of the details stored on it, and not be required for the wallet itself to function (so if it disappears then funds are still safe) and without causing 3rd party risk. More about it in a sec.
2. The wallet. This would run on a device. It would be able to work independently but can use the central server as well for special resources. Apart from the fact it has the modified BIP44 spec, it otherwise works like any normal wallet.
The Server provided the following:
1. A way for someone to store a blob of encrypted binary data on it. Lets say restricted to 1MB in size. Anyone can request a blob by proving a large random string, and the server will ALWAYS return back something. Their wallet would generate the string by encrypting a random token it with one of their keys similar to how BitID works. Only the wallet with the private key can decrypt the contents of the blob. Inside the blob is the names of the accounts, the config, and perhaps the comments on transactions. Now that SIACoin is looking interesting that may well be a better avenue for storage of this data in a more decentralised manner (I'll have to relook at that at some point) as my one concern was that if the API was open then anyone could just store arbitrary data on the server.
2. The server also provides a public key of its own. The wallet would create the HD accounts with 2 of 3 multisig, with one signature being the server and 2 going to the wallet owner. Now the wallet can set daily limits and the server will only sign off the transaction if those limits are honoured. The wallet would provide a way to backup its second key so that it only had 1 key on it by default. If the server disappeared the account owner can restore with both keys and recover the funds. The server can never touch the funds itself.
3. Also provide other useful features. For example SPV so the wallet doesn't need to have a copy of the blockchain etc etc.
Now the use cases solved:
1. Family account - The wallet would show all the family members and all their accounts if you have the top master key installed. If you used the XPRIV of the specific family member in their wallet, they would only see the spendable version of their own wallet (so the wallet would need to support both the modified BIP44 as well as standard BIP44). And if you used the XPUB of the specific member then they would only see a read-only version of their wallet. 
2. Restoring is easy. The backup would contain 2 of the keys. So you'd restore 1 of them. Then download the blob from the server of the account config, decrypt it with the private key and setup all the account info (names of accounts etc etc etc).
3. As long as you don't keep both keys on the the wallet, you are forced to have the server counter-sign every trasnaction and thus will obey the daily limits. Changing the limits takes several days and proper back-and-forward to ensure its done properly.
There were a bunch of other additions but that was the bit that even vaguely touched on the OP subject. I didn't think about multiple currencies but theres no reason why the same thing can't be done using the same master key (similar to how Ledger does it). Not quite sure how multi-sig works in other currencies though so that may well be outside the scope.

I would install a simple client (like mycellium if you have an android phone) and enter your master seed there. You won't need to sync the block chain to see (or spend) your balance so it's a quick way to know it's still there (or not). If not, then you should still be able to see a transaction explaining why.

If you (or anyone else) rebroadcast the transaction then it will just hang around longer till it's dropped or mined into a block. It's a bit like Chinese whispers in that every node tells all its neighbours about new transactions it hears. Rebroadcasting is just telling the transaction to a gossipy node.
You are generally forbidden from creating ANOTHER transaction that spends the same funds as that is a doubke spend and it will just be dropped by all the nodes who know about the old one. There are methods to purposely replace a transaction with another with a higher fee or spend one of the unconfirmed transactions oututs with a higher fee to get a miner to include both transactions but that's more advanced (and should be made more transparent in wallets with work being done in this area at the moment)

In fact you only need to keep the 12 words of the master seed and you can even just write this on a piece of paper.
I suggest creating a new wallet somewhere else, check what the first address is, and write down the master seed. Then delete the whole thing and restore from the seed and check that the first address is still the same. That will give you practice and confidence that it will work.

The answer to your question is that your btc is safe without needing to do anything. Armory and indeed any wallet never really stores anything and are just a big storage program for your private keys themselves.
If the chain somehow splits then it's only when you transfer Bitcoin that you may need to take care which chain it transfers on and right now there is no way to pick a chain (so it would just happen on both).

Very very low fee. It's unlikely to ever confirm (no miner will bother including it for that price).

Poloniexlendingbot. It's on GitHub. On phone so don't have the url handy.

It sends the change back. I'd recommend a hardware wallet instead when you start getting significant funds.

Ahh I misunderstood. The most likely scenario if a currency fails is it's value plummets as people flock to another one. So in this case it's not so much a mirror as survival of the fittest.

I'm not an expert on eth. However their solution is the same as Bitcoin's (and indeed ANY blockchain technology). They need a secondary layer to the main chain.

Bad 'bot'. Linux kernel has had far more development and progress than the gnu tools. Many people wouldn't notice a difference if they used busybox.

A few days ago someone with 1TH solo mined a block for a total reward of 31 btc.

Copy paste some random addresses and see at what point it changes. Depends on in it does it on post in the page or if it modifies it in the clipboard.

Well done on your operation. I'd love to do the same here in Australia, great sun. Not sure why you get down voted but the reason I mine on solar is:
1. My 5kw system is barely used normally.
2. I'd only get 7c per kWh if I sold to the power grid.
3. I get $70 per week selling to nicehash who seem to pay better than directly mining in a pool.

That just changes the question to: If I die what happens to my passwords to decrypt my seeds to access my Bitcoins.
It's a bit like the lady who swallowed a fly.

Actually on further thought it's a silly question. Each block is based upon a previous one. 
The three I meant was segwit2x, segwit, and legacy.

I'm not surprised. When I do surface mount soldering I reflow it in an oven (or with a hand held hot air gun) for a MUCH higher temperature than that.
