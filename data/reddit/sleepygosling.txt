as a european it’s very much a fact that many americans don’t actually understand socialism.
bitcoin is a great wealth redistribution and i’ll leave that there. it’s not classic capitalism, that’s for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:54
lovely story, i hope you find happiness in your new future ... they can’t hodl you down 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:04:01
look at these dips like weather and the growth of bitcoin like climate ... in the short term you have peaks and dips, but the pattern of growth is nothing but up.
there is no dip or bubble. you look at a graph of the price growth from start and what does it do? it just goes up. 
your eyes don’t lie. don’t buy into fear from people who don’t understand it. bitcoin is global, not even wallstreet can stop it now.

i’ve used coinfloor and despite a couple of mistakes (my fault) it came through, they were great with getting help as the guys seem to be board users too.

deutsche bank are the masters of corruption in the mainstream ... they will fall with trump.
ignore them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:48:27
morons who sold early will learn the lesson. hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:50:53
yeah it sucks, having to cough up £20 for £200 worth. 
still, i’m putting that towards a few XRP, which is doing beautifully right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:44
roger ver has singlehandedly damaged bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:59:18
it’s not, lots of people don’t understand bitcoin in the fact it’s impossible to crash.
this talk of bubbles is mainly fear. 
listen to something easy like stuff you should know and their podcast, the more you learn the safer you’ll feel to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:30:03
this is that ‘wealth distribution’ we keep dreaming of 
socialism is on its way in, banks are terrified and i love it �� 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:40:31
hell yeah! just think how many guys can now check out the rat race to focus on developing and following their passions?
it’s beautiful, it’s a revolution �� 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:35:33
shshhh 
there’s going to be a whole new demographic of rich nerds to keep the world economy going ��

be my bitcoin (personal) jesus, blessed, he that giveth the crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:37:10
cheers mate! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:01:26
i have mine written down and literally in a safe lol, no messing around.
so i should be able to keep my funds just secure and untouched in my bread wallet?
i only purchase off coinbase and then transfer. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:05:39
this is my understanding. it’s a small amount of btc in the long run but made a nice £150 so far in a week of owning ... best investment of my life. just hope i can get some more soon!
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:02:26
i’ve literally dealt with that old man attitude since 2014 and am sick of just seeing them being shown up as out of touch boomers trying to protect their investments.
e-currency is going nowhere. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:23:04
i’m not telling her ����
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:31:56
yeah, i’m just a lowly wageslave needing some kind of emergency backup for the future. i am late, but i’m still looking at some good living from such a small investment. no use crying over something that’s already happened ... onwards and upwards!
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:39:56
could i ask, how many bitcoins do you currently own?
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:35:11
yep, no way in hell i’m going to sell for a long time.
i’ve missed out on so many things, for once i have a bit of hope. here’s to the future, lads! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:18:33
sure, anything gained is a plus. i believe in the concept and now it’s happening i just want some part in it.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:31:58
aye, i’ve seen the whole thing from the side-lines but now the old dinosaurs are talking about bitcoin it feels like the last chance saloon before it’s all locked away. gotta get that coin!
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:44:30
nothing can turn back the clock, it’s really just a case of getting involved before the bigly investors of wall street drive this beyond the common man.
i just want an easy life when i’m old. bitcoin is now my rainy day fund. 
10 years goes fast. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:51:18
come on m8 it’s only a message board. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:51:11
and that is totally within the realms of possibility due to the limited nature of bitcoin and big players on the verge of being in the market. it’s coming.
bitcoin is the closest to a universal currency we’ve ever had and that’s not going to change.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:19:01
it’s tough but nothing can turn the clock back, and with the superpowers of wall street about to fully join in, better something than nothing ... the idea of a commodity that’s digital and forever will only gain more traction as capitalism dwindles away.
21 million coins is such a small number, no hindsight however, just being part of it now will be good. small contributions each month to what will end up being the best retirement plan for millennials who can see capitalism tanking all around them.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:19:09
i was like HEY FUCKO, you’ve been meaning to do this for months and keep forgetting. maybe i’ll be lucky enough to get a whole coin some day, before it’s truly closed off, but i feel damn good.
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:06:33
you think this is the top? lol.
do you realise how many funds are going to be running before 2018? 
following bitcoin has been like watching weather vs. climate change. the patterns are undeniable ... bitcoin is only growing. it’s limited nature means this is probably the last year for a silly wageslave like me to join in before it’s closed to average people.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:48:33
if only it was that easy.
any chance in putting £500 down now and then cashing out some in 10-20 years time is well worth taking.
better late than never, but early investors will never ever regret having the balls to drop cash down on bitcoin. it’s salty and disingenuous to say otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:22:05
there are many cults in this world.
bitcoin is a commodity and the world is waking up quickly ... if amazon announced they were taking bitcoin and i had no stake, it would destroy me.
too many regrets with not being involved earlier. there is no cash out for me until 2027.
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:10:29
you either sound salty or pessimistic.
... better late than never! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:25:10
cheers ��
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:44:58
yeah. post brexit UK is a nightmare and my job is shit.
i really need some hope for my future right now. every little counts.
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:36:59
sorry fam but your not pissing on my bonfire.
i’m already late to the party, but hey, so are millions of people. kudos to those that followed their gut earlier. i wouldn’t have done this without your courage.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:35:24
to be blunt, none of that will happen. it’s fear. 
bitcoin is strengthening before the hedge funds and the like get involved.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:36:05
thanks man, i used to be so put off from hearing about hacks and the like, want to just keep this locked away for a rainy day.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:49:37
yep, i’m 29 now and thinking this is my best chance of retirement. i have more than enough faith in bitcoin staying around long after we’re gone.
