Why so scared ppl! The entire **"Market Cap"** 1st support level (from here) is around the early 200'sb area anyway...if it breaks than the next is around 189-190'sb area (bottom so far). Unless your a day gambler, go to the beach &amp; relax, get a misses and practice baby making

a thought on this and its ability to float in recession "eventually";....if bitcoin becomes adopted like we are assuming, it would have to become more stable, right? It cant be manipulated as much once it has been pumped and dumped a handful (or more) times over years, the general global public would just be accumulating more towards majority holdings over time..."eventually", or is it a vicious cycle of shaking out weak hands here and there, majority controlled by the wealth

If you think to create interest, it will have to be news to beat last years media retail push...after all its the retailers that pushed us to $20k. When media outlets &amp; morning shows start covering BTC again saying "Breaking! this week BTC become institutional"...we will have new interest / investors on top of Wall Street, not this stuff we are carrying on about atm, this is petty talk in comparison
