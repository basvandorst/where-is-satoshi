Probably, but that's always been an issue. Unless you cannot use aussie PayPal accounts on on Russian steam, or what have you.

I'd use them to find me some sweet asian food, where I live it is kinda a pain to look for.

Rand may be libertarian leaning, but so are a lot of "right"-leaning politics. Rand is vary much a conservative with how he supports freeer markets and more state control. He also supports some big government things that conservatives often do, such as supporting SS. He isn't his Dad, get over it.

Why is it that if someone like one guy, that makes him like a whole group of people. Party politics is ass and should be abolished to *help* avoid this kind of behaviour.

That is what is wrong with the country any ways.

They know something of what they are talking about, but they are acting like a highschooler who "knows everything". They think and know too much, but not enough of the right stuff.

This is what was going though my head when I wrote this, and I am glad someone caught it. It is hypocrisy but that is how you win an election.

I think this guy is the best that the Republican party has to offer in terms of states rights. Some may say he doesn't want marriage between the same sex to be a thing, which maybe true but at least he isn't one of those people that supports a federal ban on the subject, same with marijuana legalization. His view on abortion may be a turn off for people, but you need to not hate the man for it and look on both sides, he (and many, many others like him) believe you are killing a legitimate person during the abortion process, he does support such in cases of rape and incest and well for exceptions regarding "maternal health". His view on illegal immigrants is more "liberal" than some democrats, as he supports legal status for them as well as path to citizenship. I guess the point of this was to choose a person you resonates with you and your views and don't worry about the party BS other people give into, and don't just vote for someone just because they don't agree with you on one issue.

What happens when they cannot make new coins anymore?

They only sell them because there is a market for them. Find some way to remove the demand, but don't shit on people just trying to make some extra cash.

Couldn't they FedEx or UPS just fine ?
