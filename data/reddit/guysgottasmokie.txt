My biggest barrier to spending right now is that no one in my life system will accept it. I can't pay rent with it, I can't buy groceries with it. I can buy some commodities online with it, but food and rent are my biggest expenses.

Risk exactly as much as you are willing to lose forever.

 Nor is btc backed by the dollar. Faulty premises at work here. The screenshot belongs on r/iamverysmart

Doesn't this strategy fall apart if we see another slight dip after an ATH? For example, say I'm earning 1500 biweekly, and I put 1000 into BTC. Then we see a dip like we saw around November 11th, but at the end of the month when my rent is due and I have to convert my 1000 worth of BTC back to fiat to pay rent. I've now lost value that I would have kept if I had held my entire paycheck in fiat?

No, because bitcoin is not "backed by the dollar." Her premise is faulty.

That's true in some cases of fraud, not in all cases in which the commission of the crime was later discovered.

Your anti-bubble arguments are sound though, notwithstanding the false analogy to debunked tulip mania.

Not how that works, champ. There is a rebuttable presumption of a defendant's innocence in U.S. Criminal law. Defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Remember?
