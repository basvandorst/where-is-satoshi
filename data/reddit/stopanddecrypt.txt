Not necessarily. 51% attacks don’t just come in the form of bad blocks or reverting the blockchain to a different state by being the longest chain. At one point 50%+ of the miners were mining another currency. No need to even assume maliciousness at that point, just profiteering. Reorganizations are what protects the blockchain within the same consensus rules, not outside of them.

If you zoom out on the actual site, you'll see there's even more 0 channel nodes, presumably still setting everything up.
And I wouldn't say it was suspicious, many of these people know a thing or two about what they are doing and want to connect to multiple nodes. You can't participate in routing otherwise.

I don't think ICO's are going away, but I do think that we are so early into this game that it's essential a gamble, and most of the lasting ICO's will be somewhat compliant to regulations in the jurisdiction the company behind them operates in.
I think there's a big future but it's many years out, and everything now is just playing with money and ideas to see what sticks.
Also, now with RSK out, nothing is limiting them from expanding outside of Ethereum.
I'd argue most of the *"real"* first movers in respect to ICO's that are *"here to stay"* will be SEC compliant, whether the Libertarians of this community like it or not.

That was the point of my original picture.
Take away any of the nodes that make up the circle and all the remaining nodes in that circle are still connected.

Even if that's what they did, point remains the same:






Not my OP. is my OP, and I'm responding to you. I don't care about what was referenced by the person who submitted this post while you two were going at it.
I like [**this picture**]( better, even though it falls short of how much more decentralized/distributed it will be, because this image is meant to visualize the internet itself which is very hub and spoke in nature for some isolated parts of the world. Whereas LN would allow random nodes from opposite ends to connect each other, the internet would require extra underwater cables and/or satellites, which is why that image looks like it does to begin with.


I never argued that, I said they are ***not*** routing payments, thus they are not "routing nodes". I also specified that they can be once they connect to a 2nd node ([**like this one**]( and then they wouldn't be dependent on that single "hub" you claim to be is an issue.




You could, but who else's payments would you be routing between those nodes? Let's expand the way we measure this.
At ***X*** point in time the LN is processing 10,000 transactions per second via 1,000 nodes. *(numbers are arbitrarily selected for the example)*
You decide you want to prop up 100 nodes, connect them all together, and only have a single "entry point" into your pseudo-personal Lightning network.
Now we disconnect that entry point. 10,000 tps on 1,000 nodes are still occurring. What percent of the network was cut off?
You're right though, quite literally, just measuring node counts and how they separate is arbitrary, but whether we can measure it in some other way or not, the ***effect*** remains the same, over time this only gets reduced as a risk as *"real"* connections grow.


I think we can agree that it doesn't make a lot of sense to use the current, young state of the network to determine the future ***decentralization*** aspects of LN.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:36:32
Some I can answer:


The routing is encrypted similar to Tor.
D--&gt;E doesn't know about A or Z.


You route around them. It's not cost effective to centralize, secondary lightning networks can just replace you, which wouldn't happen because they would just exist in the current network, allowing you to route around them.


Impractical, as I sure won't be, and neither will the thousands of other across the globe. This may actually deter large companies from centralizing, or force the hand to forgo KYC when it's proven ineffective.


Lightning is running right now on the main network. TorGuard is accepting it for VPN payments.

You ever get a box from Amazon and 90% of it is that [**air bubble packaging**]( that takes longer to pop than it does to open the box, and you need to pop it so you can condense it efficiently into your own garbage can, because otherwise you'd lose all that garbage room to air?
Coinbase is mismanaging warehouse space, filling up unnecessary amounts of room on the trucks, paying the shipping company an excessive premium so they don't need to care about logistics, but then externalizing those ridiculous shipping costs to the customers ***and*** charging them on top of it all.
All of this results in the customer saying *"Fuck it, I still need this protein powder blender bottle"*, but then selecting the *"Store my purchased product in the Amazon Warehouse for safe keeping"* option because then they don't have to pay for the shipping, which is only as high as it is because all the other companies have to bid higher to even get on the trucks because of this nonsense.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:35:10
You see him/her everywhere because s/he is getting censored all the time.
For what it's worth, I've engaged in a back and forth already with that user rather respectably on this subject already.
I only see time as the solution to dismiss the hub claims as the amount of nodes ramp up.
I also think people need to separate the difference between what I consider "routing" nodes and "listening" or "end user" nodes/wallets. If Blockstream's node went offline, the only nodes that would be disconnected from accessing the network would be nodes that didn't establish any other connections besides that one *(that group at the bottom)*.
All the nodes that make up that "net" and are doing "work" *(routing)*, remain part of the network and can still function. The effect on the *network* from Blockstream's node going offline only diminishes over time, the current scale is nothing compared to what it will be in a years time.
People's concerns with hubs should be directed at the eventuality of middlemen services that come online to provide a gateway between the network and end users who opt for such a gateway. If anyone thinks my grandma is going to be running a Bitcoin node or a Lightning node on top of it they're extremely foolish, there's going to be millions of people who opt for this, there's 7 billion people on this planet.
The *point*, as it is with a Bitcoin node, is that if anyone wanted to they could join the network, because full nodes will remain accessible, courtesy of the developers who don't fold to the "demands" from some individuals of excessively large/unlimited blocks. Along with the Lightning devs who have been consistently clear that it's being designed for small payments, and as such have limited the max capacity of channels *(which I'd like to see potentially reduced in the future as the price goes up)* so more people can participate in running a Lightning node.
I'm no expert, I can't predict anything. But I do believe that with time more and more people will start to have a clearer understanding of how this system needs to scale in order to maintain it's fundamental properties.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:14:56
With signature aggregation the effect is mitigated, and would be less costly than two separate transactions.
A node coming online could theoretically establish 10 channels with random nodes on the network all in a single transaction, for much less than what it would cost for 10 separate transactions. Keep in mind I'm talking about a routing node in this example.
As for an end user, if you have a wallet on your phone, you could potentially configure it to select a random lightning node, or one of your choice, and then create a receiving transaction that you then send to the person who wants to pay you. They send you Bitcoin and at the same time it establishes a payment channel with the node you selected.
Manual or automated behind the scenes, your choice.

No, it doesn't make 30% of payments fail. [**These users**]( set up their nodes specifically to test and buy silly stickers, they aren't actively routing payments because they are end nodes until they connect to another node.
A store selling stickers that has 30% of the networks end nodes only connected to it doesn't indicate a hubbed network, it indicates a fledgling network. It's laughable to point to this as a metric.
A better metric would be to only measure nodes that have at least 2 connections (because then they'd be "routers"), and then remove one of them from the equation and see how many end-to-end routes become disabled.
Take all the multi-connected nodes ("routers"), find me just one of them where if you took that one offline, all the multi-connected nodes get split into two separate networks, then we can talk.
I'm willing to bet that if you can even find one, it'll be the last example of it's kind for this network, and gone within a month at the rate the mainnet is growing.
An even better metric would be to over time, track the minimum amount of "routing nodes" required to go offline in order to split the network in two, because it won't be 1 (if it even is now) for long.

To be fair, the space it happens to open up via the weight increase that was implemented along side of it, under significant use of SegWit transactions, has a net "positive" *(depending on your view)* effect on fees if we assume a static demand for transactions.

There most definitely will be services that provide "entry points" that many people opt to use, but using that term makes it seem like people will be limited to these "entry point" services *(these terms are my own)*, or that this makes the actual network centralized. I moved all external connections *outside* the circle to stress the point that this just isn't the case. The circle is the network.
In reality, there will be a high demand, such that it will be coded up, for automated ways to connect your wallet to a random "receiving node" that is "looking for external channels".
The same way Bitcoin nodes find peers, Lightning nodes will find peers to channel with, and may have a manual setting that lets the operator accept ***X*** amount of "external" or "end user" or "wallet connection" channels. Call it what you want.

Not when their delayed responses or lack of initiative altogether to adopt an upgrade to the network is used as a metric for lack of support of that upgrade by other parties who don't want to see Bitcoin succeed.
Not when they proactively push/advocate for ***other*** upgrades that don't have support but then claim they are more concerned about ***X***, ***Y***, and ***Z*** instead of the upgrade that actually occurred.
Large mountains get snow-caps just by being mountains as a matter of course.
I think it's important the community wakes up and realizes that these companies and their actions were inevitable ***as a matter of course***, and to claim that they ***did*** something for Bitcoin just by existing *(which was going to happen regardless what company it was that grabbed the crown)* isn't seeing the bigger picture.

They definitely should upgrade *(if they can)*, but those nodes are still capable of verifying their own transactions.
They can still verify, send, and receive transactions, and they can still validate blocks with their personal transactions in them, even if the SegWit transactions look like "anyone can spend" transactions without their attached witness data.
Nobody can really spend those, and if old nodes that don't realize this try to, they will just get rejected, but those old nodes still function as a validation tool for your own personal transactions.
I personally believe cutting them off for an upgrade when there are ways to do it without cutting them off would be diametric to what Bitcoin is all about.

The other community that you frequent is notorious for downvoting, and as such, I'm rate limited to 1 post every 10 minutes over there.
Many other cryptocurrencies could go and jump off a bridge.
They could all go adopt Proof of Stake instead.
They could get rid of their supply cap and add an inflationary schedule to their monetary policy.
There's a lot of other things they can do, should we just do what they all do *just because they are doing it?*
I'm not against hardforks, but they should be planned, well tested, have a significant feature or set of features, and be set to activate well into the future *(at minimum a year)*, to allow an optimal amount of users to upgrade before the fork.
When hardforks are on quick time schedules, and common, it becomes an easy social attack vector to try and slip in code that breaks or changes the dynamics of the system, as there isn't enough time to analyze/review/evaluate that code.
2X broke after 6 months of planning over something so trivial, and it was [**pushed by a small group of actors**]( that wanted their business to remain viable.

I'd prefer if they were always on.
If they aren't always on then they will cost more than a 'normal' transaction and will result in privacy becoming a luxury.
The only other option would be to arbitrarily weigh normal transactions to equal that of a confidential transaction, and bloat the blockchain as a result, just for the sake of having both.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:53:45
Changing the average time between blocks is no different than changing the block size, they are both parameters that have the same end result with the same tradeoffs.
Nodes now have to download twice as many blocks although they are the same size, they now have to relay twice as much transaction data, although blocks are the same size, and they have to validate every transaction/block, even though everything is the same.
The net effect is the same, except now you also have to deal with more blocks being orphaned because they are found so closely together.

Thread over.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:41:48
Well, for one it's not a theory, it's 100% possible.
The questions really are: Is this being done, how much of this is being done, and what can really be done to prevent this should they decide to do this more in the future?


[They already have a history of mining smaller blocks]( and refusing to include low fee transactions so the fees would rise.
When you consider how much they have to sacrifice at first (very little) to in order to kickstart the snowball and then collect magnitudes of more in fees, it's not naive at all.
The main takeaway I want people to have is that raising the blocksize will never permanently ***solve*** their issues with rising fees. It might be time to reconsider the function of a decentralize Layer 1 at mass scale.
Haste won't address the real issues, only ***your*** issues.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:16:17
If it's not decentralized, why not just use a database instead?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:19:24


I see where you're going with this but I think it's unlikely that this will occur at mass scale, and may also incentives nodes to maintain 
I'm going to be extremely conservative and say in 10 years we'll have 10,000 lightning nodes.
I'll be extremely conservative again and say 1% of all online sales route through Bitcoin's lightning network and settle on Bitcoin's blockchain.
Given the users freedom to select any node on the network to establish an "outwardly facing" channel with, it's highly unlikely that a single node would have such a high percentage of similarly subscribed users.
I also think it's more likely that over time, as the value of BTC goes up, a lightning node's "inwardly facing" channels *(node to node)*, will have much higher balances than their average "outwardly facing" channels *(node to wallet)*, but even then, we might see a free market play out where there is a huge array of channel balances and this huge non-graphable meshed network.

Can you source this? Bitcoin's been through many social hype cycles in the past, all resulting in the same thing...boom &amp; bust. The floor continues to rise with real adoption.


On what grounds? What do you know about Ethereum at the protocol level, and how does it serve a better function?
What do you know about the ongoing research &amp; developments regarding the Bitcoin stack?


Can you name a few you have an interest in and why?


People already are. I personally keep majority of my wealth in Bitcoin (already recovered my initial investment) and spend when I want to spend. Just because the value goes up doesn't mean I won't feed myself. I'm still earning as opposed to keeping it in a bank.
As adoption picks up the rate of growth in price decreases. Nobody seriously thinks it will continue forever, and most of us "in the know" fully realize we are approaching bubble territory right now *([we even have a sticky warning risky investments right now]( we just don't know where and when or hard hard we will crash.
Just curious, do you know anything about the lightning network layer?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:49:18
You do realize that you could hypothetically build a completely separate lightning network not connected to anyone but you and your friends right? You could grow this secondary lightning network to be as large as you want it to be...***so long as running a node is cheap.***
There's just no practical way that large companies can control a decentralized routing system that is built from scratch to be the exact opposite of your concerns...***so long as running a node is cheap.***

Some of your questions might get better served by asking one of the developers or joining their Slack and asking in the  channel.
As for incentive to settle a channel as a node operator, I'm sure you'll find a balance between paying less in fees, keeping your channel funds balanced on both sides, and having some sort of "state" that's officially on the blockchain not too far in the past.
I'm actually pretty curious as to how often channels will need to be balanced out and what size channel will end up being the optimal level (if any) to minimize the frequency of channel balancing.
Maybe even a way for your node to turn off sending out from a specific channel if the balance starts leaning in one direction?
For example, I have channels with 20 other nodes, and you're one of them.
At some point our channel balance doesn't look like .5 / .5 but starts heading towards and eventually becomes .9 / .1. When that happens, my node only has .1, so it stops routing ***out*** from our channel until you route enough ***in*** from that channel to rebalance it.
I'm sure this has been discussed but I'm not in those circles of discussion with anyone regarding Lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:45:50
Exchanges and other services will use "hot wallets" to move coins in and out of their systems.
They don't last forever and they change them every now and then so it's normal to see new ones pop up out of nowhere.
Some block explorers have them labeled, but they don't always get labeled as it requires user feedback, and most people don't care because it really isn't that big of a deal.
I'm not saying this is a hot wallet, but it most likely is.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:37:46


This is the exact problem Bitcoin seeks to fix.
2008: 8,000 Billion
2017: 14,000 Billion
75% increase in money supply.
Has your income gone up 75% since then?
Has the average income gone up by 75% since then?
Population has grown ~6% from 2008 to now, so it's not a matter of total wealth being distributed between more individuals either.
Where has that money gone?
Please note, this isn't an argument for minimum wage, this is an argument that the system is fundamentally broken at it's core, and while the total supply goes up, the average citizens wealth doesn't expand with it.
Democrats try to mitigate this by saying the minimum wage should be increased and rich should be taxed more.
Republicans try to address it as a problem of over regulation.
Realistically, the system at it's core serves a single purpose: Skim money for those in power.
So to reiterate: Bitcoin seeks to fix the ***real*** problem.

I replied in another thread so I'll just copy it over, it might help answer your question.
If you're running a dedicated node you'd have Bitcoin locked up with a number of peers. Consider your channels are just your peers, and in the following scenario you aren't ***A*** *(the end user using a wallet)* but instead you are ***D***, a node operator/runner:
Let's say you are ***A*** and the person you want to pay is ***G***.
You (***A***) would "update your balance" with ***B*** via your channel with ***B***.
Then ***B*** would update their balance with ***C*** via a ***different*** channel with ***C***.
***C*** would update their balance with ***D*** via a completely different channel, and so on...until the final channel between ***F*** and ***G*** is updated.
You also don't have to worry about the node/channel status of ***E*** because ***D*** could just in that moment route through ***S*** which then goes to ***Z*** and finally ***G***.
All automatic. There isn't a person at each point of this route flipping switches.
The concept works when you consider a large scale deployment of nodes/channels meshed together constantly routing payments back and forth. A node could lock up 1 Bitcoin with another node but partake in the combined routing of thousands via small payments over a day.
You'll never have to worry how often node ***Q*** and ***L*** settle, or if they go offline or not. That's ***their*** business, and has no effect on the coins you have in your channels.
All of this takes place behind the scenes and your only concern will be your channel with the lightning node of your choice. Whether that be your node, a friends node, a family members node, the node being run by the local store that you trust, or a randomly selected node from a long list of nodes broadcasting "channel availability".
Imagine your application (Lightning wallet) lets you browse all active nodes and select one based on the preferences you like.
* Settles once a week / once a month / every day
* *They'll* pay the settlement fee vs. *you* pay.
* Min/Max channel size
* Number of active channels
I'm just brainstorming so don't take any of that as official, but you should be able to get the idea.
Likewise, that selection process can also be completely automated and you won't have to think twice about it.

To all in this thread: I respect your belief but pumping altcoins, even unintentionally, is off-topic.


***even unintentionally***
All altcoin talk is offtopic for this exact reason.
We let one slide and everyone starts going at it about which one is better, why they're better, and how Bitcoin can't do ***X*** as good as &lt;insert&gt;coin.
If you don't like my choice of words then pretend I didn't use them the way I did, but it doesn't change the fact that altcoin discussion is off topic.
We have 3 options:
1. Let ***all*** altcoin talk slide. Then get raided by actual pumpers who see we are letting it all slide.
2. Let ***no*** altcoin talk slide, as to remain unbiased against specific altcoins and to completely avoid  from happening. Then get criticized when we miss some here and there, or let some through because it might actually be relevant to a specific discussion that's going on.
3. Be selective as to what we allow and don't allow regarding altcoins, so genuine conversations can flow, but still prevent derailment if we need to.
Let's say you're a moderator of and people start coming in from to talk about how Bape has better this or better that.
Do you let it continue? Do you just let it keep happening until possibly the entire subreddit is completely off topic discussion about a different clothing brand? What do you do during a brigade? At what point do you step back and say "This is enough, all Bape talk is off topic"?
Point being, there needs to be some sort of moderation regarding these things, and that directly means that us moderators have to choose, because up and downvotes don't do anything during a brigade, and there's been plenty of resources published showing how easy it is to purchase as little as 1-2 upvotes per comment.
This includes comments that simply ***mention*** an altcoin.
You don't have to actually be trying to do anything, but your mention of &lt;pump&gt;coin triggers a bot and gets an instant upvote and a few delayed upvotes, and then maybe a burst of 5 a bit later to look less suspicious, depending on the volume of that thread.
Altcoin "talk" is off topic at our discretion, because we get the ***least*** problems by being manually selective about it, but generally remove most of it.

I'll try to explain it briefly, because envisioning how it will actually play out is difficult, and there are some other mechanics at play here.
You would open a channel with a node, it could be ***any*** node on the network that's accepting channels, and ***that*** channel would get it's balance updated.
What would most likely happen is they would require you to fund the channel opening, and then you would drain your balance over time and the node becomes liable to close it out or else they can't collect the payments you gave them over however long you had the channel open with them.
In that case you wouldn't lose anything because you already had spent your balance.
At any time if you want the remaining balance back you would then have to pay to settle that channel.

That's not what's happening here.
This isn't a widespread service either so people doing this wouldn't even be a blip on the chart.
Also, transaction accelerators have a net negative effect on fee prices, since the higher fees don't get included like they should be, the next people in line will up their fees, and so on.
It's marginal, but still net negative. I recommend learning about RBF and setting your client to always mark your transactions as replaceable just in case.

Correct. I don't actually disagree with you, just trying to raise awareness. Like I said in my earlier comment: *It might be time to reconsider the function of a decentralized Layer 1 at mass scale.*
I completely agree that the real solution is time, because small miners will eventually catch up, and in result help further decentralize the mining network.
Although, this all assumes a closed system of a single network.
Once you introduce forks and social attack vectors things get a bit muddy, until the community starts to learn over time how to ignore those forks, which I think we're just starting to get around to.

The effect of this block restructuring allowed the devs to craft a block size increase in a way that didn't cut off the old nodes on the network via a [**soft-fork**](
A new transaction type was created along with the block restructuring that allows these transactions to ***appear*** smaller to old nodes that are limited to old block versions, allowing more transactions to fit within the 1MB limit, while putting some of that data into a different part of the block.
A big misconception about this change is that the data is removed.
The reality is, the data is just stripped out for older nodes, which is a better solution than completely cutting them off.
Companies adopting SegWit means they will now receive and send using SegWit transactions, which will have a direct effect on increasing throughput on the network because many more SegWit transactions can fit into a block than legacy transactions.

That’s because Coinbase hasn’t sent your transaction out yet.
My suggestion is if you don’t like waiting for Coinbase to decide when they’ll release your TX onto the network then find another service to use or manage your coins yourself.

For what it's worth, I'm not a bank, or an organization, or a hub.
I'm just a person who runs a node.
Lightning works because of the web of nodes that allow you to route ***around*** organizations that might try and tell you "no", or put restrictions on what you can do.
You can potentially select from a list of thousands of anonymous nodes, and select a new one every week, you might even end up selecting mine and not know it.
Also, you don't have to even use it

You don't need to circlejerk to accomplish the desired effect you're talking about. It's possible to do it without colluding.
A miner could theoretically make a block filled to the brim with their own transactions.
These transactions could ***never*** touch the network, and thus never run the risk of another miner collecting those fees.
The risk in doing this is the opportunity cost of not collecting the fees from "real" transactions on the network.
The opposite situation is loading up a block with 100% genuine transactions you collected from the network, and collecting those fees.
The question then becomes, is it possible to increase your profits by ***partially*** filling up a block with your own "never touched the network" transactions, and the rest "real" transactions which you collect "real" fees from, and the answer is yes, but not for every miner.
In a way this is an "all ships rise with the tide" situation, but it has a decentralizing effect on the network, if we assume there's only one network.
***Small miners can't*** profit from doing this because their effect on increasing the average fee reward per block is marginal, they benefit by being "honest" and collecting all "real" fees because they profit the most this way.
***Large miners can*** profit from doing this because their withholding of "real" transactions have a significant effect on the average fee reward per block, but this reward is global, so small miners benefit from large miners doing this.
Given all of this, in a fully closed system what ends up happening is, over time the smaller miners start catching up to the large miners because they are collecting more "real" fee rewards, further decentralizing the mining network, at least from the perspective of it's [**Gini Coefficient.**](
What actually happens is, large miners have such an influence on the system as a whole that they can split the network, take their entire bag, and play games with multiple iterations *(forks like BCash)* of the network while real people lose money because they were mislead, scammed, or just unwisely invested into their forked network.

This is incorrect.
It "segregates" but doesn't remove. It's still part of the block, just in a different spot. It's really just changing the layout of a block, not removing anything.
The only thing that happens when it comes to "removing" is outdated nodes recieve a stripped version of the block that doesn't include the witness data.
All up to date nodes and any node that wants to take part in any future feature, would be getting all of the witness data.
Confidential Transactions?
Aggregated Signatures?
Lightning Network?
Nothing gets removed, this is just a result of the fork trying to keep all ***old*** nodes online and allowing them a chance to upgrade ***over time*** instead of just cutting them out right away.
It also sets a future precedent so a group *(like a government)* can't come along and just say "we're running Bitcoin now" and run their own "upgrade" that cuts off all the old nodes.
This is what 2X tried to do and 2X was only just a tease of what we may have to fight against in the future.

Did you make this account 1 hour ago just to come in here and spread misinformation about how Lightning works?
Check out my comment below, I'll even copy and paste it.
What you should be doing is comparing Lightning ***wallets*** to SPV ***wallets*** instead, and understanding that ***LN nodes are by their very nature, full nodes.***
So if you aren't running a full node none of your concerns apply, and if you are and SPV wallet user, you have every incentive to switch to a LN wallet.
To elaborate, if you're not already running a full node now, what are you doing when you want to spend/receive?
You're probably going to pull out your phone, go to your wallet app *(GreenAddress/Bread/Coinbase)*, enter my address and send me some coin, or maybe you have a hardware wallet *(TREZOR/Ledger/OpenDime)*.
You might also load up a program like Electrum/Armory on your computer instead but that's okay, because again we're assuming you're not running a full node *(but I wish you would if you could!)*.
So you're either using an SPV wallet, a hardware wallet, or a web wallet *(please don't use web wallets)*.
* **SPV wallets** require you to tether to a node so you can verify your transactions, and if it's not your own node, you're trusting some other entity to remain honest and run the chain you want to follow. This could be a business, or a friend/family member.
* **Hardware wallets**, simply put, hold your keys and announce transactions. Ideally there won't be a taxing demand on those companies developers to support idiotic forks of the chain *(Bitcoin Ruby/Emerald/Sapphire/Pearl/Diamond)*, but until then, you have to rely on the company that supplies the HW wallet to provide a tool to split the coins. *(Eric Lombrozo and a bunch of peeps are working on chainspl.it to make this easier for everyone by the way!)*
* **Web wallets** require you to trust a 3rd party with your keys. Don't do this, educate yourself and get your keys off of exchanges and web wallets. Web wallets that let you hold your own keys still require you to trust that they won't steal your keys.
So now lets compare all of this to a lightning transaction and wallet.
Lightning nodes are full nodes. If you're running a lightning node you're running a full node and none of this matters.
Lightning ***wallets*** connect to lightning nodes, which by extension means Lighting wallets are tethered to a full node, ***just like an SPV wallet***, in the sense that it still relies on trust of that node you are tethered to.
What separates it from an SPV wallet is that you can get an ~instant verifiable response that your transaction was sent, ***via onion routing*** over the lightning layer.
* **SPV/Web/Exchange/Hardware** wallets send a TX to tethered node --&gt; node announces it to the network --&gt; network settles roughly every 10 minutes --&gt; transaction confirmed.
* **Lightning** wallets send a Lightning TX to tethered node --&gt; node has channels open with other nodes and routes payment to your destination via optimal path. Each hop is it's own channel, and none of them are "yours" that you need to open. All you're really doing is creating a TX, sending it to a node, and waiting for a response.
If you're running that LN node that's great! But you'll also have multiple channels open and be actively participating in the routing of payments throughout the entire network, not just yours, same way full nodes verify and share deemed valid transactions around the globe, and ban nodes that continue to send invalid information.
***You*** don't have to have multiple channels open, but if you're already running a LN node you would *(unless you opt to only channel with a specific node)* so it's a non-issue. It's akin to saying if you're running a full-node you'll have to have multiple in/out connections with other nodes to share blocks and transactions.

There’s no incentive to maintain multiple channels just to try it out...

@_date: 2017-12-27 12:40:27
It's one of a set of factors, but in my view the primary one, simply because there is no cost incentive to establish a disproportionate amount of outwardly facing channels to end users/wallets.
"Best" case scenario (for the end user) is the node you're connecting to pays all the fees to open/close the channel, which just won't happen.
"Worst" case scenario (for the end user) is the node you're connecting to requires you fund the entire channel, including the assumed cost to close it, so they have minimal financial risk running this node.
You can consider these "premium" nodes, because it cost the user a premium to use them, so they ***must*** have something over other nodes to make it worth using them, not just the difference between 99% &amp; 98% up-time. Even 99% &amp; 95% might not even be enough to matter for most people, but I'd bet we'd see a nice gradient of nodes available, because everyone is different.
Again, there's no cost incentive to provide this service, even something like a DOS attack is enough of an disincentive to provide this, which becomes more and more likely to occur to your node specifically as it gains a disproportionate amount of channels.
What you'll probably actually find is LN will thrive in numbers, and individual nodes will survive through sticking with the herd, via obscurity by not being the one standing out.
We could discuss all of that another time, but I think my main point is clear, there's just no incentive to be one of these disproportionately large outwardly facing nodes, and onion routing payments are protects from bottlenecks or being passed through filters of approval, where if it didn't exist would force a hub situation if the law ended up enforcing who could operate these nodes in their country.

Compression is the better route, and it's pretty compressed as it is, but they are working on better applications.
Check out Aggregated Signatures *(Schnorr Signatures)*:
While the main use case being touted for this is making all the large transactions come out to the same size as the smallest transaction *(barring some other factors)*, I believe it's also theoretically possible to aggregate all the signatures in a block into a single signature. That would be significant.

Hashrate can mine invalid blocks at any point in time, whether a bug exists or not.
This will surely get taken out of context, but I can see exchanges taking smart precautions by running a variety of old clients to detect these things in the future and prevent accepting any blocks that fragments of the network would deem invalid.
Side note: Had this bug-included upgrade been a hardfork, there would be no old nodes to deny the validity of these exploited blocks.

I wouldn't say that it's a completely separate system that just happens to settle in Bitcoin.
It doesn't actually work without the existence of Bitcoin and the creation of multisignatures that get included into a block ahead of time.
I think Bitcoin is still in it's infancy and the protocol stack is just beginning to sprout, so to say anything that requires Bitcoin to even exist as something "other than Bitcoin" would be overly conservative.

To all in this thread: I respect your belief but pumping altcoins, even unintentionally, is off-topic.


***even unintentionally***
All altcoin talk is offtopic for this exact reason.
We let one slide and everyone starts going at it about which one is better, why they're better, and how Bitcoin can't do ***X*** as good as &lt;insert&gt;coin.
If you don't like my choice of words then pretend I didn't use them the way I did, but it doesn't change the fact that altcoin discussion is off topic.
We have 3 options:
1. Let ***all*** altcoin talk slide. Then get raided by actual pumpers who see we are letting it all slide.
2. Let ***no*** altcoin talk slide, as to remain unbiased against specific altcoins and to completely avoid  from happening. Then get criticized when we miss some here and there, or let some through because it might actually be relevant to a specific discussion that's going on.
3. Be selective as to what we allow and don't allow regarding altcoins, so genuine conversations can flow, but still prevent derailment if we need to.
Let's say you're a moderator of and people start coming in from to talk about how Bape has better this or better that.
Do you let it continue? Do you just let it keep happening until possibly the entire subreddit is completely off topic discussion about a different clothing brand? What do you do during a brigade? At what point do you step back and say "This is enough, all Bape talk is off topic"?
Point being, there needs to be some sort of moderation regarding these things, and that directly means that us moderators have to choose, because up and downvotes don't do anything during a brigade, and there's been plenty of resources published showing how easy it is to purchase as little as 1-2 upvotes per comment.
This includes comments that simply ***mention*** an altcoin.
You don't have to actually be trying to do anything, but your mention of &lt;pump&gt;coin triggers a bot and gets an instant upvote and a few delayed upvotes, and then maybe a burst of 5 a bit later to look less suspicious, depending on the volume of that thread.

I'd rather address this head on first. It cost a single transaction to fund a channel from your lightning wallet with a node. When you drains your funds in that channel, you can figuratively just walk away. The node is liable to close that channel if they want to collect the funds you've been paying through them, else you get them back.


Again, only 1 transaction per channel for the user. We can get into market mechanics too, and it could result in nodes listing themselves as "less expensive" to channel with, or advertise themselves as "99% uptime" but at a cost, etc...Imagine a list of thousands of nodes that your app randomly selects from, or you can select one yourself, or you can use your friends, or you can run your own. The market will create diversity, not centralization.


Why would they only connect to each other? They would just exclude themselves from the rest of the network. You're thinking this action is exclusive of everyone else when it's actually just excluding themselves if they do it.

Service providers make up a bulk of the transactions on the network.
Service providers adopting SegWit have a direct effect on expanding transaction throughput on the network.
Service providers who go on about more space being necessary ***now***, but not adopting the feature we have ***now*** that directly gives them that extra space, is contradictory.
when will [BitPay]( adopt SegWit?

Just to elaborate a bit further on this for everyone else:
Let's say you are ***A*** and the person you want to pay is ***G***.
You (***A***) would "update your balance" with ***B*** via your channel with ***B***.
Then ***B*** would update their balance with ***C*** via a ***different*** channel with ***C***.
***C*** would update their balance with ***D*** via a completely different channel, and so on...until the final channel between ***F*** and ***G*** is updated.
You also don't have to worry about the channel status of ***E*** because ***D*** could just in that moment route through ***S*** which then goes to ***Z*** and finally ***G***.
All automatic. There isn't a person at each point of this route flipping switches.
The concept works when you consider a large scale deployment of nodes/channels meshed together constantly routing payments back and forth. A node could lock up 1 Bitcoin with another node but partake in the combined routing of thousands via small payments over a day.
You'll never have to worry how often node ***Q*** and ***L*** settle, or if they go offline or not. That's ***their*** business, and has no effect on the coins you have in your channels.
All of this takes place behind the scenes and your only concern will be your channel with the lightning node of your choice. Whether that be your node, a friends node, a family members node, the node being run by the local store that you trust, or a randomly selected node from a long list of nodes broadcasting "channel availability".
Imagine your application (Lightning wallet) lets you browse all active nodes and select one based on the preferences you like.
* Settles once a week / once a month / every day
* *They'll* pay the settlement fee vs. *you* pay.
* Min/Max channel size
* Number of active channels
I'm just brainstorming so don't take any of that as official, but you should be able to get the idea.
Likewise, that selection process can also be completely automated and you won't have to think twice about it.

All the blockchain data is retained in the home/.bitcoin folder *(generally)* on Linux. On Windows it's in the AppData folder.
You can reuse that data without having to resync when you upgrade.
On Linux upgrading is as simple as installing the new version from scratch. You may want to rename the original folder by adding "-old" or something along those lines.

I appreciate you [editing]( your post but you might want to avoid the need to edit in the future. Hostility isn't the same as being critical and generally leads a conversation away from being constructive.
Let's take a step back and address some things:
If you're not running a full node you're not running a lightning node.
Channels are just multi-signatures that you and other nodes agree upon.
You in this case, are a full node / LN maintainer.
This isn't your baker, this isn't your doctor, at least not right now. Nodes lock up funds with other nodes, the identity is irrelevant.
Your concerns over the IT competence of doing all of this is why there is extensive research and development around making sure that running a full node remains affordable and a possibility for as many people as possible. At some point we'll all be able to do it, and it'll be as simple as having a cash register in your storefront or a router in your house.
All that being said, LN re-enables platforms like SatoshiDice without backlogging the blockchain. If Yours[dot]org would adapt (check out yalls.org), this would enable a much better system to build their business model around.
LN is freeing up space and enabling much needed growth in this system. It's not a bad thing by any means, it's just the expectations around it in the short term are misrepresented because the network itself is misunderstood by many.
Long term is anyone's argument, but short term there are clear incentives to get this up and running, so let's not be dismissive about the "hopeful future" use cases on LN.
I never mentioned a baker, but the person was just making an example. I just tried steering the conversation in the direction it should go for the near-term, and in the near term there probably won't be a baker unless they are an enthusiast.
Acknowledging this doesn't dismiss all the positive uses cases in the short term for lightning and implying it centralizes the network is the issue I have with LN fudders.
Pardon me for assuming you were one of them, but your account was fresh as fresh can be.


I hope you don't mean legally, and if you do I think you might not fully grasp what we're seeking to do here with Bitcoin.

No they aren't because this mempool is set lower than the default Core clients are set to.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:04:26
This is mempool. It's not ***the*** mempool.
~~What's more likely is~~ It says it right at the top:


Nodes are set to only keep ***X*** amount in the mempool, and the lowest priority (based on sat/byte) transactions get dropped.
It also makes no sense to store all those transactions because then you'd also have to relay all those transactions and other nodes will not accept them because they don't store them either.
It's just one metric to manage your node with, another already happens with "sub" 1 satoshi/byte transactions, as the default relay fee for Core clients is set to 1000 satoshi/***kilo***byte.
You could change this to 500 sat/kilobyte but no other node would relay the .5 sat/byte transactions you send them.

There's another alternative: Weigh non-confidential transactions heavily to discourage using them at all, unless necessary for whatever reason.
@_date: 2018-09-21 17:22:55
Chains built on invalid blocks are irrelevant.
A post-exploit fix wouldn't keep an invalid chain and just "reverse/delete" those coins.
The fix would just let nodes know what chain to follow, and that chain would be whatever the nodes prior to 14.0 consider valid.
The longest valid chain.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:03:53
The fix is a softfork.
The new and ***invalid*** chain would be a hardfork.
In other words, the ***exploit*** would be a hardfork.
I'm not considering a hypothetical "exploit and fix" a hardfork, here's why.
* Segwit was released in version 13.1.
* The DOS aspect of the bug affected nodes 14.0 and later.
* The inflation aspect of the bug effects nodes 15.0 through 16.2, and negates the DOS aspect.
Nodes below version 14.0 are immune to the bug entirely. They would not crash, allowing them to remain up, and then they would reject the inflationary spends/blocks. ***From the perspective of all these nodes, any attempt to exploit this bug would be the exploiters forking off.***
The caveat here is majority of the network would have still been effected under this exploit, causing a list of potential complications with exchanges and services. A fix would cause these nodes to reorg any blocks they accepted while the exploit was taking place, to the chaintip deemed valid by nodes prior to 14.0. The amount of blocks reorged would only be those that were created by the exploit and thereafter.
So, circling back to your question:


The fix, applied ***before*** an exploit, would be:
*  a softfork for vulnerable nodes
* a softfork for all non-vulnerable nodes.
The fix, applied ***after*** an exploit, would be:
* a hardfork for all 15.0 through 16.2 nodes that were online at the time
* a softfork for all 15.0 through 16.2 nodes that come online after the fix is applied
* a softfork for all 14.X nodes that crashed, when they eventually came back online
* a softfork for all non-vulnerable nodes
It should also be noted that any vulnerable version, if ran after the *network* moved forward from this event, would still be able to sync and carry on.
So again, I'm not considering a hypothetical "exploit and fix" a hardfork.

I don't agree with this, and I've respond to a comment like this before:
I think this is a fallacy:


When in reality ***X*** is and was always replaceable and could have been satisfied/occupied by another company.
Or in another way, Coinbase isn't ***X***, the niche Coinbase occupies is ***X***.
Do you think that if Harley Davidson didn't exist we'd just never have another prestigious "All-American" motor company?
Do you really think that if Coinbase didn't exist some other company or opportunist wouldn't have filled that niche?
Maybe Circle would've never backed down and filled that role instead.
Remember when Brian Armstrong [**promoted Bitcoin Classic?**](
Remember when Coinbase promoted 2X?
Coinbase is a company that ***happens*** to support Bitcoin, but to claim they are doing *"good"* by sheer effect, without paying attention to the cause, might be a misrepresentation of the company.
In the future you might just as easily say the same for Bank of America, and BoA might bring on billions in value and millions in users that Coinbase never brought on.
Do we award BoA with the same achievement status and then ask Redditors who have been around the block [*"What have you done?"*]( when they warn against BoA?
Also, we have no proof of how those claims/metrics are verified/determined, or how many of those users actually bought Bitcoin.

Hashrate doesn't dictate what chain is valuable.
Hashrate follows what chain is valuable.
Might be straying too far with this, but look at it like a symbiotic parasite in an organism. The parasite doesn't dictate what the host is, it's a new thing entirely. The parasite ***could*** kill the host, and itself along with it, or in more extreme hypoethicals *(think Stargate)* the parasite could take complete control over the host.
Simply, and less metaphorically, this doesn't make that hypothetical chain, that the hashrate created and some of the nodes accepted (majority or not), *Bitcoin*.

**1:** Segwit doesn't kick old nodes off the network. Segwit ***conforms*** to the validity of older nodes. This is why it's a softfork. Additionally, it being a softfork has nothing to do with hashpower support. The 95% was meant to signal readiness, not vote. Miners don't vote.
**2:** You're contradicting yourself here.
* 1) The BCash chain is valid in BCash-land because the nodes says so, but
* 2) in Bitcoin-land the BCash chain is invalid because the hashpower says so?
This is just silly. Nodes dictate consensus, and the BCash chain is not a valid Bitcoin chain because old nodes don't consider those blocks valid. They break the consensus rules.

This is purely anecdotal, but [here's a section]( of the mempool chart from an [older submission of mine](
Coinbase at the time was doing ~375 sat/byte transactions (if I recall correctly), which was correlated with the red section at the time.
If we count out the purple because it wasn't growing, and [section the image even more]( you can kind of estimate how much they accounted for *(if we assume they provided that sat/byte rate for all of their customers, and that other companies were using different rates)*.

It's already expensive for much of the 3rd world due to the current bandwidth and non-diskspace related hardware requirements.
A growing chain would result in a situation where you could never even catch up during the initial block download period, and if you had hardware that could, you'd then also need the bandwidth that can handle the propagation of those blocks and transactions without getting capped by your service provider, or having to pay extra for that extra bandwidth.

* 7 Billion people won't be using Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, within the 40 years no matter how well it works. Lower your time preferences, because this isn't saving the world overnight. Yes, there are "babies dying", but there will be much more of them 100 years from now if we don't get this right, and mess up the only currency that even has a chance. Children won't be using Bitcoin frequently, nor will the elderly who are likely to opt for custodianship in some fashion. Stop pretending like these things don't exist and will be killed off by Bitcoin. Not everyone wants, needs, has the time, knowledge, or ability to make use of such a system. This is something that will never go away just because Bitcoin exists. We need Bitcoin to provide the *option*, and my point is: *your number are off*. 
* I'm going to give you shit because you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Segwit allows, on average, the equivalent of 2MB worth of data. They're not "extension blocks". All Lightning transactions are Segwit transactions. It's just a new address scheme, and it's called Bech32. Please drop the nonsense you've been fed by critics.
* Signature Aggregation is going to allow many transactions to consolidate their data, and in turn, this will allow many channels to be opened at once for a much cheaper cost. This is extremely significant, and extremely overlooked. All SigAgg transactions "are Segwit transactions". 
* You talk about 100's of different tools, and how they all will need to settle on the blockchain, but you ignore probably the most impacting tool in this regard, federated sidechains, which don't require an equivalent amount of settlements on the blockchain for everything that happens inside the sidechain. Most large institutions will be interacting in this way simply out of necessity. Even if your argument is "Bitcoin isn't for the banks", you can't even be upset with this because it effectively keeps most of their volume off the main network. Having more tools *does* help solve the problem.

I send a transaction from my node out to my 8 peers. They each send it to their 8 peers, and so on.
This is how long it takes to spread across to 90% *(red)* of the network.
Keep in mind, when I send a transaction to another node, that transaction needs to be validated every hop until it get's to your node.
Block delay is quicker because almost all transactions are already validated by your node, so with blocks you node does some fancy cross checking with what it already validated and just sends it to the next node.

This is just not true, and understanding why requires understanding:
* Why Bitcoin works the way it does
* The tradeoffs Ethereum makes to obtain its "extra functionality"

Payment channels aren't limited to Lightning, and Lightning doesn't encompass the entirety of "L2", but this is definitely a protocol that requires knowing the network graph to route, so you won't be routing payments ***through*** hidden channels.
Correct me if I'm wrong but the only nodes/wallets that could be hidden would be single channel, non-routing nodes/wallets.

Hi, r/gaming mod here. /s
You're welcome to come and discuss all the different kinds of video games over here, but is it really so wrong that the r/leagueoflegends mods ask you to be civil and keep the discussion on topic?

Right, but at some point in the future it's entirely reasonable to assume that there will be service providers for many people who will opt for it, and if that service provider went down all those customers would be disconnected.


*(Not directing this at you, just being tangential here):*
I think it's foolish to assume everyone will want to though, so how many millions will be cut off from Chases' Lightning Service? Or app ABC123XYX's Lightning service?
I don't think any of that makes Lightning any more centralized.
If you can download a wallet and channel with random nodes on the network and just start routing, whether my mom has a wallet with 1 channel or not has no effect on that. That random node could easily be my node, but why should we factor in peoples wallets to the decentrality of the network when those wallets could connect anywhere else just as easily?
Just my opinions.

Well, to put it bluntly, a regulated blocksize cap (has prevented it from going up)*.

That's what I mean. Invisible means not routing for others.
I can't look at a node I want to pay and route to that node using *(going through)* the invisible node.
They can send and receive, but they aren't routing. They would just be one of [**these green dots**]( but invisible.
They could have multiple channels open too but again no one can route through them so *to me* invisible nodes aren't part of the functional network.

Many here aren't active on cryptotwitter or don't care for it. Twitter is mixed, Reddit is divided into sub topics.
As someone who moderates here but uses Twitter more, I'm able to see that divide pretty clearly when people post so just giving a heads up.

Altcoins are completely off topic (unless it's Doge).

Here's Giacomo at HCPP17: 
And on Bitcoin Uncensored: 
I am no but I'll give combining Giacomo's thread a shot. Someone linked a site that aggregates tweet storms but the formatting is still bad so here it is pieced together:
Ok, here I am. I'll write down some bullet-points. This isn't a rebuttal of your article (no time for that, at least not now): it's just my own list of arguments about what specifically I think makes you, and every other bcasher who isn't intentionally malicious, stupid.
1: Bitcoin is one of the greatest financial opportunities in human history. If anyone interested in wealth &amp; misses it/fucks up w/ it, qualifies as stupid. I get from your other tweets that you're not interested in wealth (I am), so at least this point doesn't really concern you.
2: Bitcoin is one of the greatest opportunities for the advancement of personal freedom in human history. I think whoever qualifies as a "libertarian" in the anglo-saxon "free market" tradition (I guess this is the case for you) &amp; misses it/fucks up w/ it, qualifies as stupid.
3: When I say "misses it/fuck up w/ it" (1,2) I mean, in a crescendo of stupidity level: 
1. privately dismissing it
2. publicly dismissing it advising others to do the same
3. publicly &amp; actively attacking it
4. going down in history as an enemy of Bitcoin (zenith of stupidity).
4: Bitcoin is a complex topic: I don't think who don't understand it fully qualifies as stupid just for that, but who, w/o understanding it, voices very strong/controversial opinions about it, taking extreme stances under the effect of his own cognitive dissonance, does qualify.
5: Since Bitcoin is complex (4), I don't think everybody should/could come to understand it deeply, subtile trade-offs included, but I think everybody who isn't stupid can easily use basic heuristics to distinguish/compare other people's expertise, skills, integrity, honesty. Thus, even w/o discussing his ability to master this complex topic directly, whoever systematically, continuously &amp; exclusively conflates experts w/ solid arguments with obvious/blatant scammers, fraudsters, con-men, manipulators &amp; compromised/bad fully qualifies as stupid.
6: Slight change of topic (it will make sense later on): I think I understand Bitcoin enough to say it's very likely an unrepeatable experiment. Altcoins, even if they weren't the scammy, clumsy, useless, inferior Bitcoin clones they all are, are inherently stupid, because:
1. their success would undermine the only thing that make the "digital gold scarcity" value proposition possible (focal point around the original issuance)
2. they can't replicate Bitcoin's "immaculate conception", they're compromised since day 0, by definition.
So, I think that, while the Bitcoin experiment COULD very well still fail (even if I think &amp; hope w/ all my heart it will succede), altcoins couldn't possible win. I think it's very stupid to bet on the altcoin-takeover or (even worse) on the multicoin-coexistence scenarios.
7: Another slight change of topic: it's obvious to me there is a fundamental problem w/ a global-state network designed in such a way that it will FOREVER require EVERY single node to get &amp; process EVERY single past &amp; present state change. I think only a stupid would disagree. Luckily, I don't think Bitcoin as a whole is doomed to be such a system (even if we could say it has been for a while). There're are several techniques, some already imagined by Satoshi &amp; even by his predecessors, that could at least mitigate this (obvious) inherent problem:
* trusted 3rd parties for little/fast txs, where counterparty risk is minimised anyway, + on-chain settlement (Finney),
* trustless nSequence-based payment channels, + on-chain settlement (Satoshi),
* few big "masternode" enabling trustless SPV via fraud-proofs (Satoshi),
* trustless sharding: nodes get/verify only some relevant information, ignoring other parts of the global state (Todd, Maxwell, alt.),
* trustless pruning: nodes get/verify only recent information, discarding all the old information eventually (Todd, Maxwell, alt.).
Unfortunately, not all these theoretical techniques turn out to work in practice: 
* trusted 3rd parties turned out to be a systemic risk
* nSequence channels idea was broken &amp; we had to wait years to be fixed (SegWit+LN channels) &amp; improved (LN trustless onion routing),
* Satoshi's fraud-proofs turned out to be unfeasible, making SPV basically trust-based &amp; the "few big masternodes" model easy to censor/attack
* trustless sharding (aka Sidechains???), while being sold as a buzzword by Ethereum scammers, is still a difficult/unproved topic,
* trustless pruning turned out to be unfeasible as well, leaving syncing nodes w/ the need to get/verify ALL the past information, to discard it only after sync to save space.
It takes a stupid to think that difficult problems are magically solved just by some (smart) idea.
8: I think I know Bitcoin enough to say that, as long as the aforementioned fundamental problem (7) still exists (thus excluding future advancement &amp; current off-chain 2nd layers, finally in production), there's a difficult trade-off between easy-validation &amp; easy-transaction.
* An hypothetical blockchain w/ 200kb blocks every 4hrs would be cheap/fast to validate: we'd run full nodes on our mobiles, orphan-rate would be low &amp; mining decentralized. But only few use-cases (big/slow settlements) would fit on-chain, forcing everything else off-chain.
* An hypothetical blockchain w/ 10Gb blocks every 2secs would be trivially cheap/fast to use directly for every use-case, including the most stupid ones, but it would be too expensive/slow to validate for anybody, centralizing Bitcoin completely.
There's a spectrum in between.
9: While I can accept different opinions about this (w/o necessarily considering stupid who would make the opposite point), I think there're solid arguments hinting at the fact that Bitcoin as-is could be too much shifted into the easy-to-transact extreme of that spectrum (8) just empirically, a lot of people are transacting on-chain (even for very stupid use-cases where you DON'T need censorship resistance at all) while very few people run validating nodes, most relying on centralized 3rd parties that could easily compromised/corrupted/censored.
10:While maybe debatable, the above argument (9) for Bitcoin being, as is, actually too much transaction-friendly (as opposed to validation-friendly), could/should be already pretty concerning already in the current context, that we could/should consider a BEST-case scenario:
* Internet infrastructure is not likely to be partitioned in the next months because of global wars (hopefully), 
* Bitcoin mining isn't (yet) illegal in China, 
* Bitcoin users can sync even without using Tor because Bitcoin is not (yet) fought so hard by government, etc.
But Bitcoin should be able to survive &amp; remain censorship resistant in the WORST case scenario! The same could be said about orphan-rate &amp; mining centralization: arguably too high since years in an overall good case scenario! What could it become in the worst case one?
11: Even if my assessment about the position of Bitcoin as is in that trade-off (9) was wrong (I really think it isn't), I guess it takes a special kind of stupid to ignore the fact that the different failure modes at the 2 extremes are actually NOT SYMMETRICAL at all:while in the "crippled extreme" there will ALWAYS be use-cases that will pay/wait enough to be mined, by definition, there are not ways to survive government censorship in the "centralized extreme". Given Bitcoin's goals, it's very stupid not to be conservative about this!
12: Regardless of the kind of update/change we are talking about, EVEN if it was super-safe from a validation-costs/mining-centralization point of view, every possible change of rules, good or bad, IS in itself an attack surface that could be used to corrupt/attack the project! This would true ALSO for changes I personally approve, like Segwit (I elaborated further about this very topic in my old "Split" article, but it seems to have been taken down by Crypto Insider, i don't know why:  … ...ping  
13: Arguments against contentious "on-chain scale" increases (9, 10, 11, 12) are reinforced by the fact that, while for things as fungibility &amp; decentralization it's race against time, for throughput increases THERE IS ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, there is NO RUSH by definition! Many said we should rush to avoid that "altcoins will take over", but this is just logical non-sense. Either my argument about altcoins (6) is true or it's false. If it's true, then altcoins CANNOT take over, because they can't possibly deliver what Bitcoin can deliver. If it's false, then fine: what's the problem in getting financial freedom with one or more altcoins, expecially if we are here for the ideological goal (2) and not for the financial one (1...but even in the case, we can just dump some btc to buy the winner alts). Win win! If that argument is false, there's no need to change Bitcoin in contentious/dangerous way: we can just wait for the "better altcoins" (lol). On the other hand, if that argument is true &amp; we DO compromise Bitcoin's security, even just a little, we screwed up our only chance.
14: Even if I was wrong about the current state of Bitcoin (9), the simple fact that there isn't/cannot be ANY RUSH (13) makes obvious the choice to prioritise study/development/adoption of long-term sustainable solutions (off-chain), instead of kicking the can down the road.
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:39:17
Just so I have a better understanding of what's actually going on here:
Let's say I have a channel and the other party settles at "sequence number 6" and it confirms, but I have sequence 7 right here.
If I do nothing and then they spend those coins to a different address, I would assume those are theirs now, and they should be.
If I post sequence 7 before they do anything, what exactly happens during this "override" process?
Better question I guess is, what is the timelock period that allows me to contest after it's already been confirmed?
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:30:30
15: Now I'd like to get back to a more general topic. I honestly think it's a clear sing of stupidity to fall for the old, typical, standard, obvious trick of populist conspiracy theories! These theories are all very similar, &amp; they all basically go like this: "the world would be perfect, everything would come for free, w/o any scarcity, any sacrifice, any trade-offs...if not for an evil minority who creates ARTIFICIAL scarcity ù6 trade-offs, all to get some power over us with extremely complex &amp; not well defined machinations!". I think only stupid people falls for this kind of cheap rhetoric, but don't get me wrong: that's a lot of people! Most persons are more stupid than the average person, &amp; the average person is indeed very stupid! That's why populist myths are widely used by politicians.
16: While populist conspiracy theories are stupid in and of themselves (15), the particular one used in the "Bitcoin scalability" circus is an astonishingly idiotic variation around the basic plot. I really thing only very stupid people could fall for something like this (5). In this case the explanation of the conspiracy is more cumbersome than usual. To begin w/, basically all the cypherpunks that pioneered the discovery of Bitcoin (Back, Szabo, Todd, Finney) inexplicably do agree on the existence of the "artificial" trade-off/scarcity. Weird! Then some of those pioneers are even recruited by the usual conspiracy villains (Bilderberg/Rothschild/Whatever) to create a company, Blockstream, committed to destroy Bitcoin through conservation/promotion of the "artificial", fake limitations/trade-offs. Wow, much evil! There isn't a very clear explanation of the exact motivation behind the Bilderberg/Rothschild/Whatever evil plan...probably they're just afraid of Bitcoin since they "control all the banks" (Duh!). Don't tell anybody but...I think they may even be JEWS!!! Spooky!!! Since dumb conspiracy theories don't have to be consistent, this goal is confused w/ another one, aslo very typical: PROFIT!!! Sooo evil! Apparently, Blockstream "will make money w/ commercial sidechains, because people will use the Lightning Network due to small blocks!". Ok, LN isn't really a commercial Sidechain, but an open, permissionless layer on top of Bitcoin, characterized by negligible-to-inexistent fees, developed by many independent company/developers &amp; run by thousands of independent, competing parties. But who cares, right?
17: On logical ground only, we can already say this particular flavour of populist conspiracy theory (16) is so stupid that only very stupid people would fall for it. But it's also based on many factual lies, all actually very easy to debunk: ie the number of Bitcoin Core developers employed by Blockstream, the number of Bitcoin Core developers NOT employed by Blockstream, Lightning Network developers employed by Blockstream, the number of Lightning Network developers NOT employed by Blockstream, and so on. There are also a lot of economical/political misconceptions (about "censorship", for example), typically used to promote this idiotic conspiracy theory. I tried to list some of them in this talk:  …. Only very stupid people would believe this stuff.
18: Simple heuristics aren't just useful to be skeptical about non-sensical conspiracy theories, but also (&amp; especially) to beware clear, obvious, blatant fraudsters/liars. So, the "big block" field is now mostly lead/sponsored/pushed by: Craig S. Right, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver. The first is a confirmed con-artist, who tried to impersonate Satoshi Nakamoto w/ false (delirious) claims, fake digital signature, fake pre-dated blogposts &amp; PGP keys. Every single con attempt was publicly debunked. Purpose? Visibility, but also patent-trolling vs Bitcoin. The second is an Asic monopolist (I actually hope not for long), connected w/ the Chinese government, who is playing since years an obvious monopoly troll-game against Bitcoin, completed w/ kill-switches, backdoors &amp; covert optimisations built on stuff sold to other people. The third is a pathological, narcissistic liar, who was caught lying about not using sock-puppets &amp; who spent the last month spreading fake news &amp; FUD vs Bitcoin &amp; using his online channels to defraud newbies, selling them Bcash while they where looking for Bitcoin. There're actually other, embarrassing minor characters in that pathetic circus, one more ethically questionable than the other, from the "bamboozled" disgraced former developer Gavin Andresen (who supported the CSW fraud), to academic-plagiarism-hero Emin Gun Sirer, etc. Only someone extremely stupid would think this kind of brigade could really replace Bitcoin as the new private, censorship-resistant, global, sustainable, digital gold standard. To think that Bitcoin could be replaced by an altcoin, for whatever reason, is generally stupid. Even if Bitcoin was really doomed by some convoluted conspiracy (16), any attempt to replace it would fail (6). But EVEN IF one really went down this road, literally ANY other altcoin (maybe "big-fast-blocks" LTC?) would have more chances than the embarrassing scam Bcash!
19: For all these reasons, I think you're either stupid or malicious. I hope you don't take this as a personal offence. I don't think stupidity is "genetic": I think it's mostly a choice, some kind of intellectual dishonesty/laziness. People can stop being stupid. You should.

Everyone talks about sending, nobody focuses on receiving.
How often do you receive Bitcoin?
Leave the channel open and if you ever receive money via Lightning, you already have a channel established.
Eventually you'll be able to give an address to receive coins, and that address will be a channel.
The fee already had to be paid by the person sending the coins and what address they send to doesn't matter to them, so their on chain transaction  they were already making can effectively open a channel for you. We just don't have the infrastructure for this yet.

The thing is, market cap is a good metric to compare Bitcoin against ***itself***, but terrible for comparing against other coins with artificially inflated markets on limited exchanges, especially when those tokens have an absurdly high total supply, mostly held by the original devs and opportunistic miners.
What's annoying is when people take that and use it against you by saying you're being hypocritical.
"Market cap is only a good metric when you use it, huh?"
No, market cap is a good metric for comparing a single thing against itself from a point of time in the past.

Forget ***ASIC*** resistance.
It's a stupid &amp; misappropriated term, and most people in this space have no idea what they are talking about when they raise this subject.
When people say ASIC resistance, some actually mean ASIC resistance, while others mean ***hardware specialization*** resistance.
Both are stupid.
AS**IC** resistance is stupid for the reasons you point out, algorithms can make use of other kinds of hardware that don't bottleneck on the **I**ntegrated **C**ircuits, like memory intensi--blah blah blah.
"Hardware Specialization" resistance is stupid because every algorithm can have hardware created that is specific to completing that exact task to the best of it's ability, and the only thing standing in the way of that hardware getting built is R&amp;D price and the manufacturing price.
What happens when someone comes along and actually makes it? Now they have a monopoly, and the little guys can never even try to compete.
Resistance of all kinds is stupid.
You want the easiest-to-ASIC algorithm possible, so a random startup can take out a small business loan and start fabbing chips.
You want the barrier of entry ***as low as possible***.
Resistance aims to do the opposite.

Would you be able to do a secondary one that doesn't count nodes with a single channel into the equation at all?
I personally don't consider someone to be running a "full"-Lightning node if they aren't routing, just like I don't think one is running a Bitcoin node if you're only downloading the block headers (SPV).
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:05:50
You'd have to ask someone much more informed on this subject than I, but my understanding is that the "6 degrees of separation" concept plays a role here, and that more nodes won't have an effect on this as long as the networks data is regulated.
Regulated as in, blocksize is kept consistent, blocks are consistently full, and then the market assesses this naturaly and starts to produce a consistent non-sporadic flow of transactions, which I'm inclined to believe would require a "spill over network", like Lightning, where the blocksize is kept at a level so that there is ***always*** spill, because miners will need those fees when the block reward goes away.
I linked it above but it's important to note that transaction delay has not gone down, and blocks aren't full so there's still more room for that to grow before it stabilizes.
I sort of slipped up in the title implying "all delay":

Pretty much this.
Explorers like  will kind of do the same, but they'll spread them out more and sometimes they'll be hidden in between the rest of the network.
I especially like this one because it separates them, as they aren't routing, and they highlight which nodes happen to have a lot of single channel nodes connected to them.
I'd like to change this so those nodes are a distinct color, so they don't get confused with the "other" green-ish nodes.

Apologies, stale blocks would definitely occur more often. I think by extension that would also make the orphan rate go up.
I'm not sure about the HF/SF situation for difficulty adjustment.
Also, just logically, if each node is just checking the hash to see if it's below or above the target, then that would mean all other nodes would reject those "easier to make" blocks, which implies it's a hardfork. There could be some other factors here I'm not aware of, but I'm pretty sure it's not a soft fork because old nodes would get cut off.

False signaling to speed up the inevitable crash of the rising faction?

It's not that complicated. You run one or the other clients, you signal one or the other clients.
Miners mine, and then signal in the blocks they mine one or the other clients.
You're the CEO of an exchange, you announce your support for one or the other versions.
You're a developer of a popular wallet, you announce your support or keep quiet or stay unbiased.

@_date: 2017-03-28 03:30:31


This fundamentally comes down to ***ideals*** and the ***theory of things.***
I like to use the [Ship of Theseus]( to explain the 2nd part, and how defining what Bitcoin ***is*** is a very subjective thing to even attempt to do.
As for the former aspect, the ideals:
Ultimately in deciding the direction of a decentralized system you want 1 Person = 1 Vote. *(and this can be debated against, but it is of my opinion)*
My grandma doesn't get a say because [the adoption S-Curve]( implies the most important "in stone" features take place in the first 1% of the growth phase. Which implies a significantly higher percentage of people who understand what they are deciding. *(We are still in the 1% no matter how it feels we're about to "moon". )*
When this all started, 1 CPU = 1 Vote was an indirect system because ***faking multiple people*** is easy through a [Sybil attack.](
***In fact, BU's primary argument against "1 Node = 1 Vote" is how easily it could be Sybil attacked.***
1 CPU was as close as we could get to at the time for accurately representing 1 ***real*** person.
All that being said...as time moved forward, things changed as the scale of this system changed.
GPU's provided significantly more hash, but hey "everyone has a GPU" was the unsung thought brushed off at the time.
CPU was swapped with hash, because CPU's and GPU's were both major players in the mining fee market initially.
GPU's --&gt; FPGA's --&gt; ASIC hardware.
Each step along that path becoming significantly more and more centralized, with one caveat: The consensus stayed 1 Hash = 1 Vote, despite many predictions from people along the way that this would be a major problem down the road.
Now here we are, being forced to address the "ideals" of *"what Bitcoin decentralization means"* and how this changes at different scales, or succumb to Chinese mining farms and their interests.
Lightning Network does something great for all of this.
You, I, all my friends, we can run lightning nodes and collect fees. We can re-enter the fee market because LN lowers that barrier for entry.
***LN moves the slider closer to 1 Person = 1 Vote.***

A UASF would only be viable if supported by Core and the exchanges have already stated their position in favor of SegWit/Core indirectly by opposing BU.
Like I said, their message is intentional, they don't need to be clear for you. They just need to indirectly support SegWit/Core and deal with whatever happens in the future, as it happens.
Mining majority doesn't matter and never will. The result of this whole ordeal will prove that, when Bitmain/Antpool and their ASIC warehouse continue to mine BU, yet SegWit is still adopted and considered the real BTC by the economic majority and exchanges.
Then, when Bitmain/Antpool give in and switch, it will only solidify how much the mining majority doesn't matter, and probably null the issue of a "mining majority" moving forward to the next event.
Miners are the necessary evil, but they have no real power, unless they use that power offensively to attack. They essentially sell their souls for profit, and I'm not concerned about an attack.

SegWits throughput increase coupled with a 2MB throughput increase would **double the prior trend** of already doubling increases, from 100%... to a **400%** increase in one go.
Originally: 32--&gt; 64--&gt; 128--&gt; 256--&gt; 512--&gt; 1024--&gt; ???
2MB doubles throughput by adding another 1MB to the current 1MB.
SegWit ~doubles throughput by **Seg**regating the **Wit**ness.
SegWit*2MB = x2+x2 = x4
1024*4=4096=400% increase, as opposed to the normal 100% increase

TL;DR: **Money.**
Are you [**really**]( asking [**why**]( Why [**would**]( there be a [**bad actor**](
In a system that was initially designed to avoid those behaviors en masse, when you stop asking ***can*** this be avoided, and start asking ***why*** would you avoid it... you lead down a slippery slope of bad **precedents** that undermined the entire original concept. [A very important concept that I seem to have to keep stressing whenever this subject comes up.](
The goal is to ***disallow***  this possibility. Large blocks ***allow*** it.
Why would anyone want to let one entity control all their wealth? A *government*?! NO WAY! What are we, people from the 2020's?! *That's so 200 years ago*...
The purpose of Bitcoin was to remove control from a central party ***by force***. Prevent them through a protocol that can't be gamed, a protocol that doesn't favor ***bad actors***.
Just because a behavior was witnessed in the past doesn't mean that behavior will continue in the future.
Miners are a [necessary evil]( They are in it for the profit and when the profit margins dip, sometimes they hedge their losses by mining different coins. The profit is the only true incentive, and many major miners now aren't necessarily in it for the "decentralized appeal". **They just want money**, just like the speculators who try and create up/down-trends in the market and sell at the top to make it crash and buy back at the bottom.
Why would someone want to make the market crash if it means there's a possibility they might make Bitcoin crash for good while doing it?
And to respond to comment below because they tie into what I said above:




Tell that to the skeleton crew mining operations all over China being run by single millionaires who don't care about the longevity of Bitcoin, just their invest returns.


Nope, they'll just shut down until it's profitable again. They are already making money. The % return is better than [CD's]( or [bonds]( and they just pull out when that return disappears.


None of this is relevant, miners (Like Bitmain/Antpool) with a **major hashpower** percentage ***profit***, and profit is their motive.


You weren't responding to me originally with this, but let me just add in here that I don't think Bitcoin, long term, is vulnerable to these malicious actors with major hashpower "votes". The economic majority will decide which chain to use (if there's a split). 
That being said, if you consider a fork and [2 chains]( a vulnerability, then yes, these "vocal minorities" pose a threat to a chain split.

Okay, remind me again why they ***need*** to mention a UASF in their PR statement?
***If*** a UASF was implemented, it would be backed by the Core devs.
Let's just completely bypass the discussion on whether the Core devs would even want/do this, and *assume they do*, **for *your* arguments sake.**
Then, after we agree that the exchanges are aware of a UASF and just not mentioning it in their statement, we can conclude that the exchanges also know that this UASF is backed by Core (assuming it ever does come to fruition), and BU is in opposition of this.
Remember, **what they said in that statement is for PR.** Their stance ultimately remains the same, and I'll paraphrase their in-between the lines and perfectly legal wording for you: "BU is not what we want, or we think the people will conclude is Bitcoin and we will treat it as such."
You don't have to agree with this, but let's ignore the technicalities here and stop pretending that the details about what a fork really is, or the different kinds of forks, actually matter. **They don't.**
There's no laws or precedents for a situation like this. Legally they can do and say whatever they want, even if what they do/say contradict each other.
The only thing that matters is what chain more people back at the end of the day, and the exchanges know that more people back the Bitcoin protocol that is being developed by the Core devs.
I welcome any prepared and well structured defense to anything I just said.
***ALL THAT BEING SAID:*** If by some magic, out of this world power bestows it's influence on this whole system and somehow influences the adoption trend in the other direction towards BU...the exchanges can still go back on their word if they really wanted to because there is no precedent. This is just them betting on very good odds and making it easier for themselves on judgment day, should there be a chain split.

I'll try this ***again***.
Miners are essentially just [**contractors in a social system**]( that they can choose to be part of ***or not.***
***The same logic applies to the all users of this system: the node runners, the miners, the developers, the speculators, the enthusiasts, the holders, the hopefuls, and so on...***
Yes, the miners are part of that system, but ***they are not the majority.***
Their voice will be heard, but at a level equal to their user base, ***not their hashpower.*** Don't believe me? Hit me up after this whole debacle between blocksize is in the past and let me know what wound up happening.
The system itself and the contracts that are made available by this system are ***determined by the entire community.***
The current social contract ***for mining*** is pretty simple: **If you do *X*, you get *Y*.**
X is whatever is required to support and help build the blockchain in it's current state.
Y is a payment ***set by the users.*** This payment is determined by the users in multiple ways.
1. Block reward and a deflationary Bitcoin creation process with a block halving every 4 years and a ~21,000,000 cap to help transition from primarily block reward payouts to ***fee payouts.*** This is hard-coded into the system and can only be changed by a universal agreement by all users to change this. (Pro Tip: This is probably one of the few things that will NEVER get changed.)
2. A fee market **created by limiting transactions through a set blocksize.** Without a set blocksize, you could effectively mine very large blocks, eliminating demand to be included on the blockchain, thus eliminating the fee market entirely in one grand sweep with a period of very large blocks. ***This exploit would interest malicious actors trying to bring down the network.*** The alternative option if blocksize wasn't set would be that majority-hash miners could collude to keep blocks small to force higher demand to get your transaction through, creating higher fees, thus giving the miners more profit as a result.
3. The price of each coin is determined by all users through ***demand for the coin being circulated on that blockchain.*** This means forks that divide the chain will have varying prices ***determined by all users through supply/demand.*** This changes the total payout to the contractor and provides/removes incentive to mine specific chains.
4. Potential for additional contracts the agree with and further incentivize partaking in the original contract, like Lightning Network, which would restore the distribution of payouts/users to a much more decentralized ratio while ***increasing the overall payout to miners at the same time. Creating even more incentive to mine and signal for an implementation of this network.***
Lightning Network creates a second fee market with it's 2nd layer of LN-Nodes that process multi-signature transactions and collect fees in the process.
This would allow a ***much*** higher throughput of transactions, enabling a ***much larger user base*** to participate through cheaper fees. 
These fees would be cheaper for the user (which creates user growth) but the ***income*** (not profit) would be substantial for the fee collectors (LN-Nodes).
The LN-Nodes would then compete with each other through mining fees to post the final transactions onto the network. This creates more demand to post to the blockchain which creates higher fee payouts, which creates more incentive to mine. This push-pull creates a "***fee balance***" between the miners and LN-Nodes, and further builds the contractual incentive to be a "network builder". (ie: Miner/LN-Node).

Money can be physical or digital. If you want to convert you *hard earned* bits into USD you need to first decide whether you want physical USD or digital USD.
If you want physical cash, try localbitcoins.com, or the corner of the block. Or buy physical items online, maybe even precious metals like gold/silver.
If you want digital, you're going to need to use a third party that transacts in digital USD monies.
We call those banks.

This not the same as letting it get unnecessarily big.
The size is getting increased with SegWit. No one is opposing an eventual block increase ***when it's needed.***
**BU's real goal is not 2MB**, it's an ***unlimited size, determined by the miners.*** Effectively letting a **small** percentage of the entire Bitcoin community control a very **large** portion of the network.
What they are doing is ***bootstrapping this terrible and damaging idea*** with a small sub-set of people who have been convinced that a 2MB ***short-term fee relief*** for users is somehow more important than long-term network capacity and ***long-term fee relief*** for users.
Unfortunately, this centralization is already the case and ***Emergent Consensus only speeds this process up.*** LN puts a leash on all of that and gives the other end of that leash to the users running Full-Nodes, who can now effectively "upgrade" their full node to a Lightning Node.
You and I can take part again, like we used to be able to do until the people with money bought a lot of mining hardware and centralized the mining network.

Serious question:
Couldn't they also "*outbid*" the small miners who make less of a profit by setting the fees (through block size) just right to squeeze out that competition?
Couldn't they also manipulate the fee market by using their hashpower to mine bigger blocks (if variable block size is implemented [*emergent consensus*]) thus removing the entire mempool and eliminating fees, ***and then*** squeeze the block size down creating an artificial fee market completely in their control because now they can repeat step 1 again, squeezing out other mining competition?
***Or are you against variable block size?***

If one of the nodes/hubs goes offline while the payment channel is open, then the payment channel closes and whatever the current balance between the two clients is gets posted to the blockchain.

I'm going to break this whole thing down and ask you to elaborate on some things.


Fair, but enough with this "big-blocker" nonsense.


Which is clearly **wrong.** 
1: You're clumping every "big-blocker" into one group and [**assuming they all feel the same way you do.**](
2: You can't say SegWit is not a scaling solution without providing evidence that opposes the technical proposals the Core devs claim SegWit does.
Let's address what "big-blockers" want: **More transaction throughput per block, *ceteris paribus*.**
Let's address what SegWit provides: **More transaction throughput per block, *[heavily tested code]( that helps lay the foundation for future throughput increases*.** 


1: SegWit is onchain, it just allows other devs to start building on top of that chain much easier. Look at Ethereum's progress.
2: SegWits **throughput increase** coupled with a 2MB increase throughput increase would double the prior trend of already doubling increases, from 100%... to a 400% increase in one go.
Originally: 32--&gt; 64--&gt; 128--&gt; 256--&gt; 512--&gt; 1024--&gt; ???
2MB doubles throughput by adding another 1MB to the current 1MB.
SegWit ~doubles throughput by **Seg**regating the **Wit**ness.
SegWit*2MB = x2+x2 = x4
1024*4=4096=400% increase, as opposed to the normal 100% increase
 It's risky, it's selfish, and it **[sets a precedent.](
Precedents are why we have Supreme Court Justices to stop **both sides** from creating new laws that set bad precedents. The lawmakers have *feelings* and *ulterior motives* that blind them.
Unfortunately, we don't have a system like that in Bitcoin, so here we are...


There's no need to compromise. ***Throughput*** has been increased every step of the way. Just not the way ***they*** want.
It's like a baby crying that he can't have more candy while the mom tries to feed him broccoli because she knows in the long run he will be much better off.


1: Rude is a word that is commonly thrown around when people conflate their **feelings** with ***perceived* facts**, and then they are presented with **facts** that are ***perceived*** as another persons **feelings**.
2: You're doing that thing again where you assume everyone here is a "small-blocker".
3: Not that many people are flocking.

Keep in mind, there are many different kinds of forks and the way they implement can have different consequences.
The exchanges recently (and controversially) all pretty much agreed that if BU can't safely fork into a separate chain without interfering with the "Core chain", they won't be listed.
This technically means we'll have a clean split, and they would have to push out an update with a delay in the activation that waits until a certain threshold to "safely" split.
Pretty much a blow to their movement because half of their punch was founded in the "OMG what's going on" factor, dumping all the coins from the "Core chain" immediately after a split to drop the price.
Now both sides will be prepared and "counter dump" will happen.

If you permit this, it allows gaming the system. ***The majority hashpower providers are a small group of people.***
It also [**sets a precedent**]( for future changes that further permit gaming.
The ultimate goal should be to take away as much power from the miners as possible.
They are a [**necessary evil**]( and only exist because we give them incentive to: Block rewards/fees.
That doesn't mean we bow to their demands because then they will demand more.

The double spend problem shouldn't be misunderstood with how that 1 BTC's path is ultimately chosen.
The double spend problem is ***preventing*** making 2 coins from 1 coin.
If I'm ***foolish*** enough to send the same money to two different people, then the system decides who gets that coin.
If I'm ***malicious*** enough to try and send the same money to two different people, it just won't work and will be sent to one, or the other.


Correct, either Alice is ***foolish***, or ***malicious.***
The response to this will be: Alice will learn her lesson, Bob will know next time to wait for a confirmation.
All that being said, your next question will probably be: "Well, then Bitcoin transactions aren't safe instantly as people would have to wait 10 minutes to guarantee their money."
That's being worked on with things like the Layer-2 protocol called Lightning Network. The details are a bit more complex and I'd recommend understanding what that "puzzle" is that miners work on, before moving on to understanding Lightning Network.
 rest of this post you can skip over if you're not interested in a simplified version of what the *"puzzle"* is. (I'm bored at work.)
Every block is essentially a list of transactions. Since every transaction is basically: [random address] + [amount of coins] --&gt; [random address],  this list of transactions (this block) is ***essentially random code.***
There are more factors than this (like the current time, etc.) but for simplicity sake, let's just assume every block has a different and unique value ***"just because".***
All code is essentially a long string of 0's &amp; 1's, which could then be translated into numbers you're used to: **65465078595875366324543564377868768564876985847356**
We take that value and put it through an algorithm like [**this one.**](
We get an output like this: **014ee91fa18e86b61c26ebaa31e0f01e61108bed282484099b6ed2595d2a4892**
If you follow that link and use the same string I used you'll get that same output. ***Play around with that and change some numbers around to see what happens.***
Here's the value for **10**: 4a44dc15364204a80fe80e9039455cc1608281820fe2b24f1e5233ade6af1dd5
Same length, every time, essentially random value.
The string for 10 + 3 (which is 13) : 3fdba35f04dc8c462986c992bcf875546257113072a909c162f7e470e581e278
The string for 476 + 5 (which is 481) : 51d089cdaf0c968c94b80671489d22b6f79b1c57de80df880b008e9b37b49788
So what I'm doing here is demonstrating what happens (very simply) with that ***"block value"***.
Miners need to take that value, add a random (nonce) value to it and ***hope*** that the output looks like this (just an example using 0's): 
This is very hard to do and all it really is, is just guessing constantly at different hashes.
"Hashes per second" "H/s"
GigaHash/s : GH/s : 1 billion guesses a second.
Currently the total network hash rate is [**3,500,000 TeraHash.**](
That's [3,500,000 * 1,000,000,000,000] guesses a second just to find a value that results in a specific string of text.
Or 3.5 [Exa-Hash](

***I think a push needs to be made to stress what the lightning network really is*** and how it's just an addition to the bitcoin protocol the same way the DNS protocol is an addition to and branch of the internet protocol.
I know it's hard to believe a corporate entity when it comes to these things but I would like to point out that Blockstream's patent for [***SPV***]( ***is not the Lightning network.***
Also: ***Lightning network is not a sidechain.***


Blockstream's [patent application]( is for their own **SPV sidechain** (Not LN), which could be ***built on top of the LN***.
This can be done with or without LN. The simple fact here is, LN increases throughput and benefits everyone. It doesn't skew the system towards corporate entities.

No, a 1.0MB--&gt;1.5MB would not break Bitcoin.

SegWit already provides a ~100% increase in transaction throughput.

The S-curve graph is just a random one I pulled off of google.

I pasted the Coinbase price chart below it and and drew some circles to show where I think we are on the S-curve.
The 2nd chart is one somebody plotted showing price growth along a logarithmic graph.
You can see the Gox bubble in this chart and I've plotted a similar bubble for the future to represented what we are likely to see if the price value does x10 again from 1k --&gt; 10k, a slow decent down to an equilibrium price.

I'm going to continue indirectly responding until you grasp my point.
Using Bitcoin at all is currently illegal in [4 countries.](
I'd presume accessing the data stored on that blockchain would also be considered illegal. If not...we can assume that if the data on the blockchain contained information that was considered "bad" in that country, it would easily be argued in their "courts" that a law was broken.
That being said, we have million dollar companies in this country right now storing a blockchain that has URLs stored on them linking to formally hosted child pornography.
Are the URLs illegal? Or is the content and hosting that content illegal?
Is it illegal for me to say out loud the individual letters of a URL? Or just illegal to post that somewhere...
I think all of this is slowly forming a big picture about where we are in society right now, and I've addressed that in more detail in my above posts.

First, let me remind you that we've moved the discussion from present ramifications to potential future ramifications if/when Bitcoin becomes significantly bigger than it is now. 
I say significantly for a couple of reasons I'll address below:


Is China is going to tell me what to do? China can try and influence their people, in their own jurisdiction. China isn't going to go to war with me because I post images of Tank-Man on the blockchain. Those images are availible all over the internet right now and anyone in China can access them through VPNs.
Is China cracking down on out of country VPNs as well? There are larger dangers than the blockchain and by the time the blockchain is a big enough danger it will be unstoppable.


Like I said, their action won't influence anyone outside their jurisdiction.


This already happens here in America. And it's perfectly legal...I could go do it right now. This isn't unique to the blockchain. Have you ever visited 4chan?


Over what? Holocaust denial? You're joking...


Once again...You're joking...


Once again: Have you ever visited 4chan? Stay there long enough and you'll stumble across it, the government doesn't take down the site and issue ***moot*** (the owner) citations.


Then nothing. ThePirateBay gets raided, another one props up. It can't be stopped. ***This is just the beginning.***


BitTorrent clients distribute those things...Using Tor allows you to access those things...Neither of those clients are illegal.




You let me know when one major country decides to make hosting Bitcoin nodes illegal.
Like I said, we are entering a new era, the government is losing more grip on the society it controls every day.


I double dare them to do something about it.
All that being said...If you still have your doubts, then ***I really don't think you understand blockchain technology and it's potential, or what we're doing here at all with Bitcoin.***
***This isn't just about online money.***

Depends on your goal. I don't know you're level of knowledge so I will throw whatever I can into a quick summary.
A private key is any 64 character string composed of the following characters: ABCDEF0123456789
Those are [**HEX**]( characters, which are used to visually display a [**Base-16 numbering system.**](
This gives you ***keyspace*** of 16^64.
Or: 2^256 different private key combinations.
Or: 1.1579209e+77 combinations.

Through an agreed upon ***1-way*** algorithm, we take that private key and get a public key.
Through another agreed upon ***1-way*** algorithm, we take that public key and get an ***address.***
Here are 20 examples of private keys, all of which I would bet my life on that they aren't in use ([I randomly generated them](
You can take a piece of paper and write down 64 letters of your own and that's a private key.
Your wallet can do this for you.
[There are]( sites that [help]( you through [this process.](
Or you can use an exchange that holds your coins and handles the keys on their end.

What was your vision for the future back in 2012?
Were you really that narrow minded to think that eventually mining ***wouldn't*** become centralized by people with a lot of money if we didn't prevent it?
How do you propose we prevent it?
Because all I see with this and every other "let the miners decide" proposal doing, is allowing bad actors with ulterior motives coming in and gaming the system.

And I don't mean their sheeple that they've convinced to follow them, I mean the small percentage who are actually behind the BU movement using their already established wealth to secure future wealth and power.
This is a debate of power where one side is for the economic greater good, while the other side is for control, ***disguised as the good side.***
This isn't about block size ***at all***.
Transaction throughput gets increased through SegWit, and as time moves forward ***if it becomes necessary*** to increase transaction throughput again, we can increase the block size.
There are other developments down the pipe that are actively being worked on to help scale Bitcoin in more than 1 dimension, as opposed to *just* a block size increase. All of which are ***open source*** and free for everyone to use.
Let me reiterate: **SEGWIT DOUBLES TRANSACTION THROUGHPUT**

This means that there will be two separate chains ***if*** a fork happens, which means you will have two sets of coins. **Your coins are your vote.**
The miner hashpower majority is severely dominated by a small group of people. The economic majority is much more decentralized.
So when 50% of hashpower moves to BU, it needs to be understood that this is not anywhere near 50% of the economic majority.
***If*** 100% of the economic majority valued BTC at $1,000, and valued BTU at $0.00 ***then there's no economic incentive to mine BTU.***
Miners have zero control on what we value, which is why **your coins are your vote.**
Sell BTU coins in the event of a split because they will be instantly overvalued.
Buy BTC coins in the event of a split because they will be severely undervalued.

I'm not a developer so I'm just trying to brainstorm logically how this could be done.
We all have a reddit account, and the only way to verify our identity authenticity would be by "signing" with our account. Pretty much any comment or private message would be considered authentic since we need to be logged in to make it, but still runs the risk of a malicious actor logging in to that users account and creating their own tips. (I have a solution to that, and it doesn't involve multisignatures and the user can take complete control over the private key at any point should they want to.)
I think you would want this to be an add-on/plugin, as storage of the private key to sign with would be necessary on the client side to avoid a "*hacker*" logging in elsewhere and tipping, and also removing the need for trust in you and your software.  But it also needs to be much simpler than typing out a signed transaction.
If a full transaction can be sent from the users end, your client would only need to be responsible for recognizing and then posting that transaction to the blockchain. Even if intercepted, the transaction already has a sender/receiver/amount, so it can't be exploited.
Potentially a wallet add-on (maybe partnered with RES to get a far reach/large user base) that encrypts the keys on the user side using the users reddit account/password (or anything they choose, personally I don't think they should be keeping much on these wallets anyway).
After I use the command "***xxx***" in a reply to the person I want to tip (the receiver), MiniTip pms me a string that could look something like this: **[Receivers_Address][Tip_Amount][Fee_Amount]**
The add-on would recognize the string format and recognize that it's coming from and notify me via an icon at the top/bottom of the page, or with an optional pop-up.
Upon clicking the icon, or in the pop-up, the user is presented with a request of the decryption key (user+pass_string for authenticity) and generates a signed transaction *(based on the data in the string: [Receivers_Address][Tip_Amount][Fee_Amount])* with all the necessary info and PMs it back to with another recognizable string format.
Now it's just your software's responsibility to recognize that format, confirm it's the same receiver (as to not be exploited) and then post that transaction to the blockchain.
Or maybe there's a better way, I don't know, but I'm happy to try and contribute. Get on it before someone else "steals" it.

This sounds like a debate between someone who sees $500 and buys more because he's thinking long term and someone who sees $500 and starts to question his investment because he's thinking short term or put more money into this than he can afford to lose.


Sounds like you haven't been around here long enough if you're scared off $500, or even think that if it drops it will stay at $500.

**Edit:** read the comment chain, ports may still need to be opened on the routers firewall for IPv6 address, but they won't need to be "forwarded".
You're router doesn't let you ~~port forward~~ forward traffic to the machine you're running Bitcoin Core on?~~
**Correction:** Inbound connections trying to reach your ~~IPv6~~ **IPv4** address go to your router first, requesting a connection on port 8333. Then the router forwards that request *(if you turn on port forwarding for that port)* to the machine of your choice.
**Addition:** In the case of IPv6 you might still need to allow traffic to get forwarded. My router required a specified port even though the machine had an IPv6 address, and it didn't even delineate that they were being "opened" vs. "forwarded". I just selected the machine and entered the port.
It should just work either way once that is all set up.
Your router's port forwarding settings should allow you to select your local machine from your network and the port you want to forward, or what traffic you want to forward *(by specifying a port)*.

I think the suffering from an initial split will be 50/50 on both chains from a *"value halving"*. Until...
Given that the majority of the BU hashpower is presumably very centralized, the argument could be made *(and I'm pulling biased numbers out of my ass here to make a point)* that out of total ***people*** who mine, only 10% signal for BU, while 90% signal for Core. 
Some may even consider that a ***conservative*** guess, but regardless, it makes the point.
After an *"instant"* 50/50 split in value , prices will move and the side that looses the most value will take the bigger hit. Again, we assume that's going to be the BU fork, thus negatively effecting 10% of ***people*** who mine significantly more than the other 90%.
The incentive to remain on the BTC chain would be higher at all points in time after a fork than the BU chain.
Also, I briefed over your proposal and I believe everything *(not just your proposals, but everyone's)* will need some reevaluation after Lightning Network is implemented. The general consensus among advocates is it will significantly reduce transaction demand as implementation of the tech picks up among node runners and 3rd parties.
The question becomes ***how significant***, and I think those numbers need some real life action to really know and understand the dynamics.
***Especially the push/pull relationship between mining fees and lightning fees.***
Short term that fee balance will be a fee ***imbalance*** that negatively effects miners, but that will slowly balance out and then both with raise together. We'll be able to graph this over time and determine all of this as time moves forward with LN implemented.

What imaginary world are you living in that you think something as silly as fake token betting on a hypothetical chain split actually means ***anything***, and that if it does, it means what *you* think it means, vs what *anyone else* may think it means?

BCC -&gt; fork happens, segwit gets adopted and BU chain dies
BCU -&gt;
1. No fork, everyone switches to BU to avoid fork
2. UASF, BU wins segwit fails
3. XT, Classic, BU fans all voting in favor of bigger block forks
4. BU compromises and puts segwit into their 2MB fork

The fear is getting old.
If a fork doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.
If a fork happens, **vote with your coins.** Miners will go where the money is.
How the fork may happen: contentious/non-contentious.
If contentious, **vote with your coins.** Miners will go where the money is.
If it's not contentious (majority user support) then it's not *really* an issue.
How a "non-contentious" fork may happen: SegWit 95% soft-fork activation, SegWit UASF (user majority, hashpower indecisive), or a non-contentious hardfork.
If SegWit 95%, not an issue.
If UASF, **vote with your coins.** Miners will go where the money is.
Example of a non-contentious hardfork: ***After SegWit and Lightning Network,*** it may become clear over time that block size may need to receive an adjustment in it's capacity, like a 2MB hardfork. The community agrees on it, and it's done. Not an issue.
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:56:13


What makes the Lightning protocol *"3rd party"* if it's open source and fully compatible with the Bitcoin protocol should SegWit get implemented?


Why is it not feasible that in the future *(after it proves itself)* that it wouldn't just become *part* of the Bitcoin protocol?
Saying *"3rd party"* implies it's centrally controlled when it's not...
Everyone can use it. ***All the full-node clients now could be LN-nodes.***
I think it's a little deceitful to imply that the (in development) Lightning Network Protocol is in the same group as a corporate entity like Coinbase when it's not.

The protocol is open source.
Multiple layers provide multiple entry points into the system for users.
Nobody is forced to use a "hub". All it does is enable further diversification in this system. We already have exchanges that function as de-facto banks.
***There will be banks*** that process and hold Bitcoins for people like ***Grandma.***
You have two options:
1. [Secret tree-house Bitcoin club.](
2. Grandma can use it.
Hashing power will continue to grow.
Nodes will continue to grow.
Users will continue to grow.
All of this strengthens the network.
What will lightning network "hubs" do that exchanges don't already do?
Let's say we leave Bitcoin the way it is and banks come along and decide to offer banking services for Bitcoin users.
You send them your Bitcoin, and they provide you with a number on a screen (just like the exchanges) that function as a Bitcoin IOU.
Then you use your debit card with this bank and make a purchase on Amazon.com.
The bank and Amazon have an agreement in place where they keep a private ledger between themselves and at the end of the day, they send 1 transaction on the network to each other based on what is owed between them.
Amazon trusts the bank, the bank trusts Amazon. They both benefit by not paying fees for every transaction. Miners lose out on those potential profits.
Where does this leave the deli on the corner store of my block? What trust do they have in the grand scheme?
There will be many intermediaries in all of this, Lightning network offers one of many potential bridges between the big players and the individual users.
Layers are very important to scaling this system we call Bitcoin, and Lightning won't be the only one, but they will all be open sourced.

It being backed by the Core devs is important, because currently the community is "split" in two.

Maybe I wasn't clear about the type of forks not mattering. **The type of fork doesn't matter.**
**The consensus rules don't matter.**
There's no legal precedent to make them matter. Exchanges can say/do whatever they want because they are under no legal obligation to, and this statement is to make their "we're picking this team" conclusion clear before the fact, so they can avoid any legal troubles ***if*** the chain winds up splitting.
Core devs come and go, but Core remains Core, and BU remains BU, like I've said, the exchanges picked their side. Instead of being upset about their wording in a PR statement (which wasn't for you but for the inevitable lawyers), understand there's jack-shit you can do about it and deal with it.

I'm pretty confident BU will release replay protection on a pre-fork client upgrade in preparation for it. If they don't it will be controversial, and exchanges won't be able effectively duplicate all of it's users coins.
If an exchange like Coinbase can't guarantee the same product (equal coins on both wallets) to their entire user base because BU lacks replay protection on "forkday-0", there will be lawsuits. I'd even argue some moneybag holders &amp; special interests are preparing for an unprecedented legal opportunity like this to make money/establish new laws.
I'd even go as far to say that any entity who prepares a contentious fork would be extremely unwise to not provide all exchanges with that code ahead of time to prepare. Otherwise it will fail miserably for them.
All that being said, I think that reinstates my "initial 50/50" statement, even if that initial period is only 30 seconds after a split and a dump happens 60 seconds in.


I sort of agree. I think it's ***everyone's*** responsibility to make sure the fee market remains intact.
It's important to remember that ***although*** mining *interest* *(desire to mine based on profit incentive)* balances itself when fees become too cheap, it also further centralizes the mining network towards those larger entities who turn better profits, as well as weakens the network through less potential hashpower.
In my opinion any sort of future block size increase proposal needs a hard limit to avoid *"mempool wiping"*, completely obliterating the fee market in one big sweep by majority hash, knocking out smaller miners. Although I'm not entirely confident on how much of an issue that actually is.


I think there's still plenty of time to test lightning. We'll see it on Litecoin first, along with testnet I think we'll have some good data to move forward, I'm not too concerned as none of it's implemented yet aside from the ***test***net, and that's there just for that. Testing out the problems.
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:29:57
I don't agree with this.
I'm 100% for the implementation of the lightning network but I think some things need to be understood.
No matter what you do there will always be a ***fee market***.
Without payouts there is no financial incentive to mine, which in turn supports the network.
Bitcoins entire integrity runs on the very idea of ***leveraging greed***, because some clever guy realized ***you can't combat greed.***
Don't believe me? Try getting the Bitcoin network to work on ***pure altruism***, you can't, but you can support it with ***pure greed***.
The goal is to ***control*** that greed and not let it run rampant.
Currently we have a block reward that provides a ***financial segway*** into the emerging fee market as time moves forward.
Every transaction posted to the blockchain will come with a fee cost. As time moves forward the amount of transactions will increase.
Lightning Network doesn't fix ***super-longterm*** scaling, it simply ***mitigates an exponential factor*** to the growth of the network. Which is still very important.
[**Slowing a growing exponential trend down by a factor of 10 has very significant effects in the long term.**](
Does LN allow x10 more transactions? I don't know the exact numbers, all I know is it helps ***a lot.***
Back on topic: an increasing user base means increasing blockchain demand, this in intrinsic to the properties of Bitcoin and no matter what scaling solution you come up with, over a long enough period of time it will have a significant effect on direct blockchain throughput, which implies ever increasing fees until the user base stabilizes. 
*(User base stabilization implies max reach/global adoption. It can also be assumed here that the price per Bitcoin is significantly higher than it is now, which would mean fees from a transaction cost percentage perspective would be stable. ie: price goes up but %per tx stays ~the same)*
It may ***seem*** bad, but it's really not. The users won't be eating these increasing mining fees, users ***and*** LN nodes ***and*** whatever the next scaling solution is will.
It gets pretty evenly distributed with 1 simple result: No matter where on the timeline we are (5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 100 years) fees will be cheaper for users *at that point in time* if LN is implemented, rather than if it wasn't.
What does this mean for miners? It actually means ***higher payouts*** for them as the user base grows. ***It can't grow with high fees for users, but it also can't grow with low payouts for miners.***
Lightning network addresses both concerns ***but it will not be free.*** (It might be very cheap *at first*.)

It's a cop out to get the point across without directly agreeing with the point so you have a backdoor to avoid confrontation.

No, they use multi-signature hashing that require consent from all parties involved, and must be posted on the blockchain to be considered absolute.
The channels these multisigs "reside on" have limited duration times they can stay open.
**It is of my opinion** that market forces will drive channel "*lock times*" downward from demand by users for a few reasons that are open to debate. Although I don't believe a counterpoint would diminish the reliability/safety of the lightning network in general.
1. Shorter lock times intrinsically provide more security because transactions get posted sooner. 
2. Any demand for longer channel lock times (which there will be between larger entities) can be satisfied as anyone running a node can have multiple channels open with as many peers as they can connect to, ***all with varying channel lock times.***
3. "Lightning noders" can't collect their share of the LN fees until the transaction is posted to the blockchain.
4. (This one's only tangentially related.) Only malicious behaving entities would want to open channels without resolving them to negate the multisig transactions within them. Their IP's would be blacklisted by other nodes in the future, nobody would want to "channel with them". Their address with coins on them that were "staked" to open the LN channel could be followed very easily, especially if they distributed coins across multiple addresses and propped up many light nodes in an attempt to attack.
Basically, you can be pretty guaranteed your transactions get posted quickly.
If you run your own node, I guarantee you there will be a laundry list of trusted LN nodes available all over the web to channel with with varying lock times.
We could also brainstorm a bit and conclude that if you're using a 3rd party wallet or "bitcoin bank", like Coinbase for example (despite it's recent hate), like most non technical people would be down the line...You can imagine many of these will have long channel timelocks open with many other business entities, as well as shorter channel timelocks ***with those same entities*** as there will be demand across the board for near-instance block settlement and "end of day" settlements. Depending on your use case.
We could brainstorm all day like this and I rather enjoy it, but if you have any further questions I'd like to pivot this storming off of that question.
FYI, I'm nobody. Take everyone's opinions with a grain of salt.

Now, if you want to talk about adding decimals to Satoshis, then no, the point of adding the decimal is ***not*** to "add more coins into the circulation".
It's not effectively adding more coins, it's not literally adding more coins, and it's not attempting to add more coins.

The record of who owns what Bitcoin is recorded on a ledger and distributed across every network node.
If you want to have a copy of this ledger you can choose run what is called a "Bitcoin Full-Node".
Coins are publicly associated with *(to keep things very simple)* a "public key", and every public key *(to keep things simple)* has an associated "private key" that has the exclusive rights to spend those coins.
Coins can only move off of that public key if the associated "private key" says so, via a signature that proves it.
Whoever holds the private key *(to keep things simple)* has full &amp; total control over those coins.
When coins are in your personal wallet, you control the private keys.
When coins are in Robinhood's wallet, they control the private keys, like a bank.

No, SegWit was the proposal and it was blocked for almost a year by a group with money on their eyes.

People will get up in the air over terminology, but yes.
The address is a single address. Every now and then, sweep the funds into a new address that's controlled by an unrelated wallet.
When you sweep, sweep ALL the funds. Change that isn't designated goes to mining fees.
The address can be reused if you want, and it's fine if you do, make make sure every time you pull the funds, pull them all to the separate wallet you control.

Your speed isn't the only concern here.
Some people having data limitations per month that they can't exceed. That's a bottleneck.
Many people around the globe don't have that access, this reduces and limits the ability to run a node to a more select group of individuals, which is the opposite of what is trying to be achieved here.
Will we reach a point where an insane amount of nodes exist everywhere?
Yes, and we will reach that point by being as conservative as we can and not taking excessive and unnecessary leaps that open create clear centralization issues.

You can't possibly make the claim that a cryptocurrency I invented and validate/mine all by myself, with a single, central point of failure (my computer)  exhibits the same properties as that of Bitcoin.
Of course you don't.
Your argument is that centralization is boolean in nature, either it is or it isn't.

Forcing fees to be the same rate is worse than having no fees.
People could spam the network and there would be no way to prioritize your payment over someone just trying to bog down the system.

You need machines that are specifically designed to do one single think, and these mining ASICS do exactly that, efficiently hash away at SHA256(SHA256).
Those machines might have hashing power but it you made them hash what Bitcoin needs hashing they won't be nearly as efficient.
Also, the Proof of Work algorithm defines what the hardware needs to be tailored to. If an entity too large to combat targets the network the user base updates the protocol to a different hashing algorithm and then all that specialized machinery they just made is useless.

To play devils advocate, the USA supported him by providing roads, education, some sort of healthcare as a child that the government at least requires many jobs to provide for their employees and children, policing to ensure his safety, food regulations to make sure he doesn't put garbage into his mouth and die (arguably though, if you knew anything about the sugar industry this ones a grey area), yada yada yada, blah blah blah, on and on the list goes.

First we need to define what it means to have a "refund system".
If I have coins in my address that ***I control***, there can absolutely ***zero ways*** for that money to be pulled from my address.
That is fundamentally anti-Bitcoin and nothing, no argument, is ever going to change that.
On the other hand...if Visa wants to integrate their systems with Bitcoin, they can build secondary systems that settle after ***X*** amount of time, if they so choose.
This will happen so it's barely even an argument, my grandma won't be creating raw transactions and holding Bitcoin on private keys.
The only dispute here is clarifying that the base protocol will never accept a change like this, while layers above, or 3rd party systems, may (and will) incorporate refund procedures of their own, which would occur before it settles to the blockchain.
Lightning Network has some huge potential with multi-signature channels, and multi-signature payment solutions in general have a lot of potential.

I find many people seem to have this idea about Bitcoin.
It was let loose. The code was put out there and the network began.
People became interested in the idea and started working together to build the network and consider ideas in how it could work better.
A forum was created (bitcointalk) and more people started coming together to discuss how it could be improved upon.
The people who were more involved became more fluent in the space. Most people who were heavily involved were involved because they shared similar values regarding Bitcoins potential, so the ideas they proposed were genuinely for the greater good of the system.
These ideas were peer reviewed, discussed heavily, and eventually adopted, or determined to be bad for the system.
As time moved forward more people joined the space. Bitcoin attracted more and more attention. Yes there was a price, yes people were happy that they had an exchange where they could trade now (Mt. Gox), but many still new that this was still just a baby, and without the right guidance and attention could wind up dead, or turned into something it was never meant to be.
It was known from the beginning that there will be bad actors who try to disrupt the system, so people kept their eyes open. Some people kept them open a little too wide.
Accusations were made from many angles and they only grew in frequency as time moved forward.
The protocol was never in a complete state, and it still requires more development even now, after SegWit, after Lightning Network, there is a lot that still needs work, and people continue to keep doing that work.
Many people disagree on what work should be done, and which direction the network should go. Some people just talk, others make code.
They offer a suggestion, they code it, and if the community comes together around that code, Bitcoin makes its next step forward.
There's been many forks in the past and this won't be the last, the difference being, the consensus around the upgrade is either largely unanimous, or contentious.
A group of people who don't code and just run businesses that make a profit off of the system, making a backroom deal to "upgrade" the network to their liking, isn't community consensus.
When people who have put years of their life into building this system say this is not a good idea, when those same people say "we won't be backing your proposal, do what you want but we will continue to code for ourselves as we've been doing" then you get the current situation we're all in now.
You get a large community who thinks Bitcoin just works because they've only known about the price for so long, and a political situation who plays on that fact to try and sway people into taking their side as they are trying to learn about what's going on with "this Bitcoin thing."
So yes, there are forks, and no, Bitcoin isn't done being built, but I'll tell you this much: Anybody who tries to tell you that a government or corporation can be trusted is the exact person you don't want to listen to when it comes to what direction Bitcoin should go in.
Take that as you may, I am just some random person on the internet.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:01:52
So here's the thing, all transactions ***aren't*** equal.
Simply put, they are weighed by their size, and miners include them into blocks based on the fee/size ratio, to maximize their profits.
At any given point there is a going rate for how much in fee you need to pay to get your transaction included into a block.
If that rate cost ***more*** than the amount you have on an address, it's worthless to try and use.
When those rates drop, it makes sense to try and consolidate them all.
Every address used to make a transaction must have a signature, and these signatures are sizable.
[**Schnorr signature aggregation**]( is a work in progress that would allow you to combine all the signatures in a transaction into 1, ***making ~almost all transactions ~equal.***
This would render consolidating ~useless, open up a lot of more throughput on the network and lower fees for everyone in the process.
Most people who have ridiculously high fees are due to this issue (many inputs) that Schnorr can fix.

None of those bullet points factor in the current or future price, which is unpredictable at best, and necessary in determining any outcome regarding difficulty and miners financial decisions.
It's also a common fallacy within the crypto community to assume all miners act and behave the same.
Yes, financial gain is their end goal, as it should be, but their incentives don't always align with their actions.
You know why? Because they are people too, and people fuck up and make bad decisions, while other people magically make the good ones or know a thing or two about shit and plan accordingly.
There's a financial incentive to play the stock market, but not everyone wins. Not everyone has the same idea as to what the better decision is.
End goals can be shared, but how to get there can be heavily disputed.
Personally...If ***I*** was a miner, I'd never touch BCash with a 10 foot pole.
I would enjoy the difficulty drop on Bitcoin ***if*** there was one, and continue mining Bitcoin.
Why? Because while my immediate profits ***may*** be less (which is what that shitty argument that person made to justify mining Bcash was), my long term profits from holding onto that Bitcoin I mined would be much higher long term.
This act of switching back and forth every 2 weeks after difficulty adjustment is idiotic because miners aren't goldfish with a memory span of 10 seconds that only act on the immediate situation.
There are long term consequences of all of it and moving back and forth only sacrifices the security of the Bitcoin network.
So why would a miner who ***believes*** in the longevity of Bitcoin switch back and forth between Bcash and risk bringing down both chains, and then they can't profit at all 6 months from then because they fucked up the system?
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:37:12

Setting a data cap on everyone's nodes is less efficient than having your nose run as much as it can.
This effect compounds the more people need to set data caps.
This throttles the network.
We have multiple solutions that increase throughput without adding more to the blocksize.

It should be noted that he is a Lightning dev and not saying Bitcoin will fail.

@_date: 2017-08-24 23:20:43

So let's say you have a 64 character HEX string:
Changing a ***single*** digit, you have ***(64x16)*** options to choose from. Or 1024, very easy to brute force.
It ***does*** allow you some time should you realize you lost your key to try and recover the wallet, because most likely, anyone who finds it and knows what it might be, won't have instant access to brute forcing.
Aside from dropping your paper wallet in the middle of times square and racing home to recover your coins, it doesn't provide much safety.
Now, changing ***two*** random digits gives you ***~1024x1024*** combinations to work with.
That's 1,048,576.
Still completely bruteforcible.
But what about ***six***?
That's: ***1,152,921,504,606,846,976***
[**Much better:**](


But not full proof.
Can you remember the 6 random digits you replaced though?
Chances are, no, unless it's characters uniquely tied to you in some way. Good for randomly losing your key, but not good for someone who knows your identity.

The exchange manages this for you, there's a lot going on behind the scenes, but ultimately coins you "have" on an exchange are really just tokens, or IOU's.
They have large wallets and software that splits things up as efficiently as they can when people request withdrawals of their balances.
If you have a private wallet and keep receiving coins to the same address  then they build up inputs for every transaction you receive.
If you send transactions to new addresses every time, then when you spend you have to use multiple addresses, which still requires you to use multiple inputs to spend your coins.
This is actually an issue that will be [**addressed eventually,**]( but upgrades take time and we finally just got SegWit.

"Spam" transactions have been happening well before the fork.
Antpool has been completely ignoring low sat/b fees when creating blocks for some time now. They have a long history of it.
Miners can do what they want.
It's up to the code developers and the people who trust them to implement ways to make the Bitcoin network more efficient and secure.
Miners will continue to create whatever blocks they want to.
There's a couple of good solutions that mitigate the cost effectiveness of spam (Schnorr signatures) and reduce incentive to store data on the blockchain.

Node count (factoring ***out*** sybil nodes) is relevant for securing the network.

I completely disagree.
Decentralized systems like Bitcoin are the response and solution to an otherwise unsolvable issue.
Let Visa or PayPall do whatever they want. I don't agree with it but what I agree with doesn't matter.
They can do it, so they do it.
If they chose to freeze accounts for a group that was part of the majority they would probably get flack for it.
Twitter bans Milo and everyones up in the air.
Twitter bans Trump and they get a lawsuit.
People and entities act based on what they perceive they can get away with coupled with their perceived morals.
There is no solution to that besides creating a system that can't be effected by it.
That is what Bitcoin is.
That is what the decentralized version of Twitter in 10 or so years will be.
That is what the next public forum like reddit will be down the line.

Nothing in the protocol is dynamically determined by vote. Opening that can of worms only sets the entire network up for disaster and exploit.
If an exploit ***can*** happen, it ***will*** happen.
Everything is static besides the PoW difficulty and even that isn't voted on.
We are very far out from ever considering Bitcoin "ready", despite what all these people who hype the price like to think, and there's a long list of potential future improvements to the network, some of which require a hardfork. 
When those are ready, if a blocksize increase is needed, it'll be coupled together.
Right now we don't need an increase, just look at the mempool.
Look at the mempool in 1 month after SegWit blocks start getting created.
Take a look at it in 3 (now 6???) months when SegWit2x is supposed to fork, and tell me if it's needed then.
It's not.
When LN gets developed, the need will be pushed back even further. 
This isn't something that should be messed within on whim, it's something that gets fine tuned over time as it becomes necessary to do so.

Transactions go into blocks that are regulated to be every 10 minutes. 
When a block is created there is a block reward, and fees that are collected.
Difficulty regulated the 10 minute interval and has nothing to do with block creation.
Mining reward also has nothing to do with block creation.
The incentive to continue creating blocks is in fee collection.
The difficulty keeps on self regulating itself to maintain blocks every 10 minutes.

What defines lead developer for an open source project like Bitcoin?
Also, since you clearly stated lead ***Core*** developer, you're implying different branches of development have leads, so what defines a lead developer with the context of the Core community?

The protocol structures blocks to average at ~1 every 10 minutes.
This is the only thing the protocol maintains in respect to this.
ASICBoost allows miners to be "more efficient" at producing blocks.
The caveat is, those extra blocks are small and counter productive to the network.
They ONLY benefit the miner with extra rewards by creating them.
Remove ASIC Boost, and you remove the intentionally created small blocks meant to benefit from ASIC Boost.
Intentionally small blocks contribute to the transaction backlog (mempool size), and raise fees for everyone.
Miners already collect rewards, and the difficulty adjusts based off hash-rate, which adjusts based on profitability.
Everything balances out regardless.
Remove ASIC Boost and you remove this "exploit", everybody gains besides the miners that were taking advantage of it.
You can't ELI5 Bitcoin, that's the simplest I can go and it still leaves out good information.

Lightning changes this by making full nodes clear economic participants.
Also, another take would be, mining decentralization is the weakest link here and needs to catch up with the nodes.
Until it does, the extra nodes offer a check &amp; balance to the system to employ miners to be honest until every node can be a miner.
It's a carrot on a stick but it forces the network in one direction, further decentralization.

The supply ***is*** limited, but gold can also be subdivided even though it isn't.
If you own 1 Bitcoin you will always own 1/21,000,000th of the total supply.
If we move to using mBTC (milli-bitcoins, 0.001 BTC) then you're 1 BTC would be 1,000 mBTC, or 1000 whateveryouwannacallthems.
1,**000** of 21,000,000,**000** is still 1/21,000,000th of the total supply.
You can physically divide gold down to the atom, and it's worth would be equivalent to the percentage of the total supply that it occupies.


If you have 3.057 * 1021 gold atoms you still have the same percentage of the total supply of gold as you would if you had a gram, because you still have the same amount.
1 mBTC right now is worth ~$4.50. If more people want a share of the total supply, then any amount you posses no matter what denomination ***you choose*** will go up.
It honestly didn't really matter what total supply was chosen from the beginning, just that ***a*** total supply was chosen, and the reward given out per block was design to be a certain percentage of that total supply over time.

I don't believe that to be completely accurate because with Bitcoin there's a cost to settle, and if settling throughout is increased, settling can happen more often, which would directly affect a nodes ability to process more channels.
While it's still possible to increase the node count, it's not financially free of charge, and nodes do have their own bottlenecks.
It's not like we could say "hey let's just add more nodes."
At some point in the distant future when/if everyone has near unlimited access to 100gbit up/down bandwidth and you can easily store a petabyte on your phone, it would be foolish to not increase the block size whatsoever. 
The issue is doing it too preemptively, especially when we have better solutions in the pipeline that reduce waste and improve efficiency.

It's actually at the root of the most heated debate within the community at this time.
This isn't a simple process and it's not just a matter of "getting more people on board and watching the price skyrocket."
We have a loooooooong way to go, and I can't emphasize it enough.
Also, they aren't infinitely divisible, they only go down to 0.00000001
At $1 million per BTC, that's $1 per the smallest unit.
At it's current price, it would cost more in fees to send 0.00000001 .
And with the smallest possible fee of 1 Satoshi per byte: 1sat/byte, and a transaction size that you'd be hard pressed to ever get below 200 in it's current form (barring SegWit), it would cost you 200 Satoshis just to send 1 Satoshi.
With SegWit, it would still cost you 100+ Satoshis to send 1 Satoshi.

If you already sold you are liable for it all this year in your taxes, just pay it.
If you didn't sell and are still holding the coins, here's something I typed up a while back explaining capital gains:
Long Term (over a year) Capital Gains tax here is 15% for most people, unless you make more than $418,400 in a year, it's 15%.
**TL;DR;Easy Version: Subtract your yearly income (plus a little extra to play it safe) from $418,400, and cash out that much in Bitcoin per year if you want to maximize your profits (assuming you believe Bitcoin will at least maintain its current value.)**
In the US we have tax brackets for ***income tax***:






























The increased % only applies to the income made ***after*** the previous threshold ***on income tax.***
Long term capital gains won't get included in income tax but will still trigger a new income tax bracket, just none of that income is ***"income taxable".***
All of the gain will be set at 15% for most people unless you pass the income tax bracket threshold from 35% to 39.6%.
Hedging your losses in capital gains only works if you know one year you'll be making ***X*** or another year you'll be making ***Y***, where X is under $418,400 and Y is over $418,400.
You adjust your cash-out accordingly to your expected income.
Long Term Capital gains changes from 15% to 20% (5% loss of 1 million is 50k) after you pass from the 35% into the ***39.6%*** tax bracket, which is at ***$418,400.***
So if you really want to, if you make 50k a year currently, only cash out $350,000 this year, and $350,000 next year and so on.


[**If you're single and make $100,000**]( your ***wages*** fall into the 28% bracket:




Your total federal income tax on ***wages*** not factoring out deductions or anything else would be: **$20,981.75**
Your take home is **$79,018.25**.






If your capital gains from Bitcoin are another $100,000 your ***total income*** (not wages) is now $200,000.
***Your wage tax stays the same***, but your total income bracket is now in the 33% category.
33% bracket puts your [**long term capital gains tax at 15%.**](
Your $100,000 in Bitcoin is getting taxed $15,000, so you take 85k of that.
 take home is $79,018.25 + $85,000 = **$164,018.25**
Let's change this up a bit though to stress the point a bit more:










You would be losing 20k (5%) because of a dollar difference.
And that's only 300,000 in capital gains.
Millions would be whatever that 5% difference is, ***but your wage tax stays unaffected.***
But, this also only matters when crossing the total threshold of ***$418,400.***
Unless you're making big bucks, or don't care, only cash out to a total ***under $418,400*** per year, including your normal wages.
**Edit:** Please note that this doesn't include any other kinds of taxes, such as the Net Investment Income Tax, or state taxes on capital gains. ***Either way***, the procedure is still the same to avoid the tax bracket bump, just the extra taxes result in a net gain of a little less.












[**Here's the combined marginal rate per state.**](
The IRS hates me now.
Also, ***this isn't structuring or tax evasion/fraud*** because no one can tell you when to sell your assets or in what order, or by how much.
Structuring is an issue when you're trying to prevent companies from reporting your transactions by splitting them up into really small  (&lt;$10,000) amounts.
Tax evasion is tax evasion and tax fraud is tax fraud, this is [**tax avoidance**]( or simply you choosing what to sell, when to sell, and how much of it to sell.

The problem is you can't enforce something via the protocol that relies on "the mempool", because "the mempool" can be exploited.
There's no way to prove at a protocol level that "the mempool" is "full" or "empty". 
Any design that "looks" at "the mempool" to determine if we need "more blocks now" can be exploited.
You want to know what the solution is?
Increased mining decentralization, via time.
Right now, how many big boys are there?
You can count them on your hand.
Take a look at the pie charts that show how mining has (arguably) become more decentralized over the last few years.
What happens when the hardware becomes cheaper to make and accessible to more people?
The volume of miners grow. The volume of ***actual heads*** grow.
What happens when every country's government is doing their own mining?
That's some pretty large scale decentralization compared to what it is now.
Some would react to that negatively but let's be realistic...by the time we're at the point that every government is mining, there will be widespread mining availability for the average citizen, and there will be plenty of private pools to join as well.
The ***issue*** is mining centralization, not the protocol, and the ***solution*** is time.
So give it time.
It's the answer nobody wants to hear.
Alternatively, to counter the centralization issues we are having due to scaling faster than we can decentralize, a PoW change would be the only solution.
Re-level the playing field, and do it right before AMD/NVIDIA start releasing large scale mining GPUs to the public.

Well, simply put, let's say right now transaction throughput is ~1000 txs every 10 minutes.
Schnorr would save 30%, allowing 1300 txs every 10 minutes. That's an additional 300 transactions.
Let's say at some arbitrary point in the future the network can process 1,000,000 txs every 10 minutes, whether just with the lightning network or in combination with some other throughput increase.
There will be a balance that is eventually found, as demand to settle will still be controlled by the block size. Schnorr, freeing up 30%, would promote increased settling, which would directly promote more LN use in general.
Take away Schnorr and you take away 30% of 1,000,000. Or 300,000 transactions every 10 minutes.
So the effect of the Schnorr benefits are experienced non-linearly as other forms of throughput are increase.
I welcome anyone to tell me where I'm wrong here. I'm actually pretty sure I'm simplifying the math too much and the effects could not be as prominent as I make it out to be, but they do exist regardless.

The request I made was in jest.
I did lose zero wealth, considering I was a minor who didn't work or own any property and paid for nothing, but I'm sure this statement could be argued but it is moot, considering the rest of my response.
Currently I hedge any losses by putting my savings into Bitcoin.
Central banks ***may*** prevent recessions.
My argument makes it clear that that chart doesn't not ***prove*** they prevent them, only that as time moves forward they lessen in frequency and duration.
There's no data points for the severity of each recession, nor is there any data to back up the fact that the banks are the central cause for why they lessen as time moves forward.
In either case, any prevention of recession the central banks ***may*** incur is mitigated by what they steal by creating a larger supply by continuing to increase the circulation of more money into the economy.
Also, going by your username, it might be of importance to clarify that I am ***not*** anti-capitalist.

Alternatively, every time you can buy something with Bitcoin, do it, and replace what you spent buy purchasing more Bitcoin.
You're holdings remain the same, your purchase is still made, and more value is injected into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

A casascius coin is just one form of a "paper wallet".
A physically written form of a private key.
A hardware wallet is a digitally written form of a private key.
The alternative to this would be memorizing a private key, which would be a biologically written form of a private key.
Currently there are no legal differences between storing / saving / memorizing 64 random HEX characters, or storing and saving 256 0s &amp; 1s and I'd imagine there never will be.

No, there is no fix at all but let me try to make an analogy.
The Earth exists, the ground exists, atmospheric pressure exists, everything exists the way you know it.....except water.
I just realized this isn't going to hold up against the aspies who are going to try to tell me how this analogy isn't accurate but whatever, here it goes.
Water doesn't exist because the protocol of the universe doesn't support the combination of Hydrogen and Oxygen.
One day that just magically changes.
Water molecules start forming.
More water molecules start forming.
It's a relatively simple molecule to create given the right environment.
Does water just keep getting created until the planet is a gigantic tear drop floating in space?
In this hypothetically shitjob of an analogy, the water creation would eventually taper of an find a balance.
Maybe as other variables do their thing, vary, the amount of water will vary.
So no, there's no constant universal rule, but there is a ***rule of thumb***. A rough balance in the system that forms as everything else that was thrown out of whack rebalances with the introduction of something new into its ecosystem.
When that eventually stabilizes, if a variable is changed (like the block size), the fee structures are changed, demand is changed, it throws everything out of balance temporarily, until a new balance is found.
That new balance will look different on the network.
I know you don't believe it but if you think LN nodes have infinite capacity you're foolish.
Bottlenecks exist and those get readjusted when changes like block sizes go into effect.
Depending on the current model of the network, it may open or tighten that transaction bottleneck.

If you use a hierarchal deterministic wallet (HD wallet), one seed phrase/key will give you all the addresses you'll ever need and none of them can be connected to each other...
Unless you spend them together.
If every time you receive money you use a brand new address derived from the HD wallet, then every time you spend it will only be tied to the transaction where you received payment in the past.
Is analytic software being developed by some big names to try and work around this? Yes, but Bitcoin is nowhere near complete.

There were normal people who wanted to do that 100 years ago, and there will be normal people 100 years from now who will have the same desire.
Bitcoin doesn't operate on some biased view that the normal people of today are of a priority over any other generation or time period.
This needs to get done right or it will fail, so it will continue to ignore the demands of the "we need X now" crowd and operate on its own terms.
If you want something now, go make your own system to satisfy your own needs.

I don't believe the mempool can be measured at the protocol level.
It's a nice thought, but it's impractical because the mempool doesn't really exist.
Perhaps a fee system that only rewards miners with a % of the fees they include in the block based off of how full the block is?
That would require a lot of discussion and thought as it could effect the network in other ways I'm not thinking of right now.
First one that comes to mind is miners hold off on mining a block until they can fill a block to collect more of the reward, but they'd still be risking other miners taking that reward anyway 2% before them, and then the undercutting begins.
But then they could just fill the rest of the block up with "spam" transactions and collect the full fee, so then you would need a way to factor that out.

We can debate philosophy all you want, and I'd be one of the first to make a philosophical debate out of a subject for pure fun, but it's still subjective.
has a point though, despite the nitpicking over terms used.
The protocol must ***entice*** acting in your own best interest and still work.
Mining is designed at it's core to be profitable so there's an incentive to do that work. The goal should be to eliminate exploitability.
ASICBoost is still possible and it encourages miners to attempt it for a chance at faster/more blocks. It has a side effect of blocks being created that are much smaller than ***full***, which has a direct effect on re-balancing the difficulty to average block times out to 10 minutes.
The net result is the same amount of blocks, with some being smaller because of ASICBoost.
This is an exploit that only benefits miners through rewards, while resulting in less transaction throughput.
These are fixes that need to occur, and to ***fully*** eliminate ASICBoost we would need a hardfork.
Hardforks are risky in nature and need to be well thought out, planned, and have multiple implementations incorporated into them as to reduce the amount of total hardforks while still getting all of this done:

The transaction accelerator is malicious. They do it intentionally so lower fee transactions get included into blocks over higher fee transactions.

An ideal routing protocol would involve as many nodes as possible for decentralization purposes.

At first I was skeptical but I believe this ultimately levels the playing field.
Similar to the news situation where both sides start calling the others fake news, now the entire public becomes skeptical of what's being put on TV, regardless of who may say it.
It removes politics from the signaling equation. 
Put your money where your mouth is and run the code you want, if everyone stops signaling because it ultimately becomes useless, sybil attacks have a lessened effect on the politics in the entire equation.
Let people secretly support what they want.
Let someone say "FUCK YEAH UASF" or proudly announce the new 1000 BU nodes that just propped up, people will be more skeptical of it all in the end.
Doing this in effect raises public awareness of sybil attacks. It makes it a known factor and whenever ***anyone*** announces X amount of support for &lt;proposal&gt; it just looks like the guy you know from &lt;insert_place&gt; that has a loud mouth everyone knows is a bullshit bragger.
Make code, test the code, release the code. If people trust you they will run it. If your code involves a fork and a flag day, you better hope enough people trust you.
It disincentivizes actions like: "We have this code we want to make, ***but only if we can be sure we can take the majority with us,*** so let's announce our intent to make code, say "signal with this acronym" and then sybil the fuck out of it to make people think it has more support than it does."

I do want to point out that in the very same [**tweet**]( where Gavin made his claim that your entire argument rests on (Lightning becoming centralized) he also says he's "ok with that, too".


Lightning allows the network validators (full nodes) to participate in fee collection. 
It allows more transaction throughput per second without sacrificing lower bandwidth requirements on the nodes.
Opening the door for more users by broadening the accessibility of Bitcoin increases on-chain demand, which results in higher fee rewards for miners, which results in more hashpower, which results in more security for the blockchain.
Mining centralization is a different issue and will be addressed as time moves forward. The [**Internet of Things**]( will most likely resolve that issue.


This is pure FUD.
Blockstream is the holy grail of FUD arguments from and it's what they use to try and back up every argument they have.
They want a dynamic block size and they will do anything to try and get it because a dynamic block size can very easily be manipulated.
What's the first step to getting to a dynamic block size? Raise the block limit.
What's the best way to raise the block limit? Make up a reason as to why it needs to be raised.
What's the best way to justify that reason? Make up a reason as to why "the other side" is holding it down.
It's just not true.
SegWit had the throughput increase all along.
Schnorr signatures are in the pipeline and has it's own throughput increase, it also has a privacy increase as well.
No one is against increasing the blocksize when it's necessary and justifiable. It's just not right now.

It's not a matter of what I ***think*** they are going to, or what they ***think*** they should do.
What matters is what they ***can*** or ***can't*** do, the justification should never be "why would they?"
The most important thing that needs to be understood here is the network doesn't ***fail***, from the network's perspective.
The network works when there's only 1 node. Again, Google could serve the world a blockchain with 1 node.
So you now have to take this and apply it to your statement:


Since the network doesn't actually fail, it just centralizes, you have to now start considering whether miners actually care or are able to gauge how centralized it is. They don't, and they can't.
Your history tells me you're relatively new to the space, commenting in many other crypto communities, so you don't come off as someone who's trying to push false information around, but I do recommend you take some more time to familiarize yourself with the reasons Bitcoin exists, versus the reason many altcoins exist, or the misconceptions altcoins miss when trying to tackle what they perceive to be the same goal.

***We just rejected a block size increase***, and if you want one, there are alternative chains you can go use.
The Core devs won't do it just because a 2 day old Reddit account with no substance requests that they do so.
Unless you can provide a detailed analyses that counters their collective research and development I'd recommend you continue to acquire more information.

When does it end?
You do realize that the amount of actual people who wanted "big blocks" was a very small subset of the community?
You know how that changed?
People pushing *"emergent consensus"* and *unlimited* block sizes decided their goals would be easier if they changed their tune to *"just a small increase"*.
One that wasn't even needed, so they had convince more people otherwise, because they needed more "real" support, right?
So they created turmoil inside the ecosystem by inflating the fees, and pointed towards the high fees as the clear-cut reason why *"we need big blocks NOW"*.
We don't. It's really that simple, we just don't.
Guess what else? SegWit is a block size increase. The blocks are actually larger, and they can hold much more inside of them.
So no, it's not black and white, but the size *was* increased, so the debate was fabricated to disguise the intent.
They increased the size to mitigate any real slowly growing demand, but it was ignored and SegWit was touted as this horrible thing, *because they don't want a small increase, they want control.*

That's just not true.
BCash does not try to maximize decentralization in any fashion. The entire community in support of it was originally pushing for a system (and still is) where miners can increase the blocksize at their leisure without any concern over nodes being able to validate those blocks.
You make claims about others opinions on what I wrote, but still make it unclear whether you've read it or not.
How you could make that claim about BCash caring about decentralization is beyond me if you did read it.

What you must understand is this was outsourced.
Someone payed a much larger entity with a huge database of hacked information.
There's droves of hacked login information out there that never gets used, only held on to, to be sold at a later date in groups depending on the metrics someone is looking for.
So there wasn't any Bitcoin targeting. Reddit login information was collected by a third party and semi-relevant usernames were pulled and given to the purchaser.
My guess is users that were subscribed to this sub were in that metric, but I could be wrong because one person specifically messaged us saying their account was involved, and they have no interest in Bitcoin. They didn't even care to have the ban lifted.

Don't take this the wrong way, I just want to open this discussion, not criticize you.
I think this is a fallacy:


When in reality ***X*** is and was always replaceable and could have been satisfied/occupied by another company.
Or another way, Coinbase isn't ***X***, the niche Coinbase occupies is ***X***.
Do you think that if Harley Davidson didn't exist we'd just never have another prestigious "All-American" motor company?
Do you really think that if Coinbase didn't exist some other company or opportunist wouldn't have filled that niche?
Maybe Circle would've never backed down and filled that role instead.
Remember when Brian Armstrong [**promoted Bitcoin Classic?**](
Remember when Coinbase promoted 2X?
Coinbase is a company that ***happens*** to support Bitcoin, but to claim they are doing *"good"* by sheer effect, without paying attention to the cause, might be a misrepresentation of the company.
In the future you might just as easily say the same for Bank of America, and BoA might bring on billions in value and millions in users that Coinbase never brought on.
Do we award BoA with the same achievement status and then ask Redditors who have been around the block [*"What have you done?"*]( when they warn against BoA?
Also, we have no proof of how those claims/metrics are verified/determined, or how many of those users actually bought Bitcoin.

Looks like your transactions is 10 satoshi per byte.
The recent price rise has caused a backlog in the mempool but assuming all goes well your transaction should go through over the weekend unless this rally continues.
If you want to to replace by fee, your transaction needs to marked as replaceable prior to making it, and I'm not sure if Breadwallet supports that.
Maybe someone else can weigh in, otherwise you're going to have to wait. 10 sat/byte won't get dropped.

It's been in the works for some time now and the only issue was it required a significant scaling trade-off, requiring transactions be ~20x the current TX size.
Bulletproofs for CTx's were just announced which brings that down to ~3x the current transaction size.
If we assume an "always on" model *(all transactions are confidential)* this means we would need a 3x increase in block weight to maintain roughly the same transaction throughput...*assuming there isn't more math involved here.*
If SegWit (2MB) + 2X + Bulletproof CTx's happened, we would have 12MB blocks...*assuming there isn't more math involved here.*
In my opinion CTxs should be in Bitcoin's base layer or we leave the door open for abuse in the future.

Actually, that's correct, there is a fundamental "issue" with Bitcoin that reveals itself when mining becomes heavily centralized, and that is: miners have the power to fill up blocks with their own transactions ands allow the backlog to grow.
Overtime this *should* result in miners losing money as they can't collect fees, and ultimately deter them from doing it at all, especially as the block reward starts to halve more and more and they become dependent on those fees.
The other solution is to create alternative methods of transacting on top of the blockchain that would severely deter malicious miners by graciously rewarding honest miners. What are they? Great question, but it's not larger blocks.

While every one else here talking about how fees ***are*** low right now, I'd like to address the more important fallacy in your post.
Correct me if I'm wrong but your assumption is fees will reduce by half because SegWit increases throughput by double, correct?
Well, if that's your train of though it's wrong and I'll try to explain.
Under this logic, if we doubled throughput right now from 2/4 --&gt; 4/8 then fees should go from $2.50 to $1.25.
The reality is if we double throughput right now, there would be too much empty space and ***no fees at all***.
There is no inverse correlation here.
Also, you'll probably never see empty blocks again because no matter the size miners will keep throwing fake transactions in to keep blocks full and create artificial demand to keep fees up.
What we are seeing now will happen no matter the block size.

Well, 2 things:

It's not difficult to do, it's just not ***now***.
And the demand to have this stuff ***now*** is being fabricated.
Do you know anyone in real life who ***needs*** this tech now?
We should not tamper with the security model of the base layer in a way that severely removes it's decentralization properties.
I also know there's a lot of ongoing R&amp;D in what we could call "compression methods" for blocks, so we can fit much more into the same size, and potentially even reduce the size.

It's less about denying the relief (because it was given with SegWit) and more about the fact that consensus didn't come together to increase the blocks further.
BIPs were put out, even for a flexible cap. even proposed a scaling blocksize increase, none of them were adopted.
We don't address the concerns you've heard about Blockstream because the FUD around it is nonsense. It's one company out of many and it employs only a select few devs.
The venture capital Digital Currency Group does the same, but no one on that side touts them as bad actors, because they helped proposed the 2X "non-agreement" that benefits their narrative.
The reality is neither of them are intrinsically bad. I don't even think Barry Silbert meant to cause the nonsense over the past year. But that's just my opinion on the matter and some may disagree with me.

In regards to the block size my logic operates this way:
* Less is better.
* More is worse.
* "More, ***at X point in the future"*** might be better than or equal to "status quo, *right now*"
* *"More in the future"* is worse than "what we have now, *but in the future*".
* Compression is better.
* Privacy in exchange for little bit more is an acceptable trade-off, but lets see if we can make that as efficient as possible first.


I think the network would be operating just fine right now if Jihan &amp; Co. weren't filling up their blocks with their own transactions and letting the backlog build up.
They've done it multiple times already.
I think if they didn't block SegWit we would be well on our way to having businesses fully incorporated it by now and we would have a bunch of extra empty space we wouldn't know what to do with.
I also think developers would have had more time and resources to focus on the actual important code, as opposed to being forced to spend time worry about stuff like replay protection, malicious node detection/banning, countering FUD surrounding their code on social media, etc...

They all happen to be on the same side when it comes to any of these debates, and they all happen to have the most leverage.
One owns the largest mining conglomerate and blocked probably the most important upgrade to date for Bitcoin for over a year.
One invested into Bitcoin extremely early, registered Bitcoin[dot]com, has a long history of scamming, associates with others who share similar history, and has been pro-actively advocating forks that split the network with absolutely no coding / development involvement whatsoever. Even Satoshi warned against Bitcoin[dot]com.
The last one pretends to be Satoshi and gets onto panels at random Bitcoin conferances to help leverage their push for chain splitting and "uncapped blocksizes".
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:17:43
In a way yes, in a way no.

blocksize and improve Bitcoin scalability. At the time, the Bitcoin
community was in crisis after nearly 3 years of heavy debate, and consensus
for Segwit seemed like a distant mirage with only 30% support among miners.
Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and
quickly led to Segwit’s successful activation. Since that time, the team
shifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.


strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we
believe is even more important: **keeping the community together.**
Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for
a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was
never the goal of Segwit2x.


obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,
**we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with
a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the
upcoming 2MB upgrade.**


whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin
great. Bitcoin remains the greatest form of money mankind has ever seen,
and we remain dedicated to protecting and fostering its growth worldwide.


I just want to say that anyone who is on Jihan's side is against Bitcoin.
Anyone that Jihan **sides** ***with*** but doesn't consider themselves on Jihan's side needs to take a serious look in the mirror and reevaluate their ideas, intentions, and motives.
Moving into the future it's important to remember these people because this won't be the last attempt to fork the network. **You don't go and create Bitcoin Cash and then claim you have Bitcoin's best interest at heart.**
You don't promote or associate with anyone who does this.
These people who signed this withdrawal did.
No matter your view on these people, no matter how many strikes you have already assigned them, no matter how many times you gave them the benefit of the doubt in the past, they should be on their final strike right now, if they haven't already struck out in your eyes.
You can look at this as a "coming together moment" all you want, but all I see is a group of people folding realizing their efforts weren't going to pay off well for them.
If you still want to extend that benefit of the doubt I employ you to look back at this moment if they ever involve themselves in such tactics again and not extend them that benefit next time.

We've decided to address these growing concerns.
Please refer people to @_date: 2017-11-29 12:57:22
It's pretty simple *(once the "aha" moment happens)*.
A Bitcoin is just a denomination, but it's the main one, like the dollar.
Below a dollar you have cents:
Now try to imagine if below cents there was something else, and that had it's own name:
Below a single Bitcoin, you have decimal places, up to 8 of them:
฿ **1**.00000000
฿ 0.**1**
฿ 0.00**1**
฿ 0.00000**1**00
We use normal [**SI units**](  so every thousandth gets a name.
฿ 0.00**1** (**milli**-Bitcoin, or 1 / 1000th of a Bitcoin)
฿ 0.00000**1**00 (**micro**-Bitcoin, of 1 / 1000th of a milli-Bitcoin)
We generally shorten milli-Bitcoin to ***millibits***, although some don't like that term.
But the more unanimously agreed on term is the ***bit***, for micro-Bitcoins.
So there are 1 million ***bits*** in a Bitcoin. (Thousandth of a thousandth.)
***bits*** also have their own cents...they're called Satoshis.
So 1.25 bits can also be considered 1 bit and 25 Satoshis.
Realistically nobody actually uses it this way, ***for now.***

Find the bitcoin directory where your wallet.dat file is and create a config file called **bitcoin.conf**
In that simply, and only, put: **prune=550**
This will allow the Core client to prune old blocks after they get verified.
With pruning I think it's around 5 gigabytes of storage.
550 = 0.55 gigabytes of block data.
You could set this to 2000, or you could set it to 10000, or any number in between or above.

How can one even officially make the claim that it's a false flag *of a false flag*?

Take note.
There's no authority here for them to change the code.
Miners do X and receive Y, as per the consensus rules enforced by the nodes.
Some other things you should note:
* All blocks created prior to the PoW change remain just as secure ***if not more secure*** after the change. A simple block snapshot of the final block ensures this, since reorgs couldn't go backwards prior to that snapshot.
* PoW security is dependent on it's centralization, ***not total hashing power***. If PoW was changed and everyone turned on their GPUs it would be ***more secure*** because it would be ***more decentralized.***
* It would kill the altcoin market and all altcoin miners would switch over to Bitcoin.
* PoW change won't always be a more secure option, ***personally*** I view it as a one-off situation. You can't prevent ASICs, but you can push back attacks like Bitmain's at least until layer 1 is more finalized.
I'm pro-PoW change if the community supports it enough.

Blocksize will never be determined by external oracles like fees.
The restriction is in place to enforce decentralization.

**A:** Deflation is bad because it makes people want to save, so people won't buy things anymore and companies will stop producing.
**Z:** No it's not because you'll find that the savings benefits of a deflationary currency that deflates at equivalent rates an inflationary currency inflates provides marginal short term benefits for the every day consumer.
***If*** companies are concerned about deflation ***marginally*** causing people to spend less on their products, ***then make better and more enticing products.***...*Instead of making shitty products that are designed to fail after X amount of time.* &lt;---- This was a personal opinion I squeezed in because I don't like how some companies do this, and they wouldn't if they were concerned about people not buying their products due to their longevity.
So it's very indirectly related and only loosely related to the original point. 
Be gone with your strawman, it doesn't negate the subject matter.

CPU and RAM load, along with bandwidth caps are the primary issue.
We can't even have it scale with assumed technological progress because it's bad as it currently is.
This is why 's proposal suggests a decrease in blocksize now to match what would ideal in his eyes, and then scaling proportionally over time.
You won't find many agreeing, but the least we can do is at least hold off until things start to catch up and alternative scaling implementations give us better numbers to work with.

I personally think that any splits of your coins after you've purchased them should just be part of the same total and not considered new income, and untaxable.
If you consider a 50/50 split, comparable to a stock split, what's the difference between that and a 60/40 split? What happens when the value starts decreasing on one but going up on the other?
Do I lose half my worth because I didn't want to get taxed while I watch half my tokens that I don't even want lose all of their value?
It's a good question, and I'm sure we'll see eventual legislation around it.

I don't recommend avoiding taxes either, but that's an entirely different subject.
As for Bitcoin, the government still requires legally operating companies to abide by the laws within the jurisdiction they operate within, and that usually involves hiring practices that involve hiring legal citizens (or "approved denizens") of that community.
In turn, what they/you get paid, whether it's in Bitcoins or USD, goes into a paystub and is tracked by the government, else the business is no longer a legal business. The government knows what you get paid, and if you withdraw all the USD into cash and buried it somewhere, ***you still owe that debt.***
As for this:
Bitcoin will eventually have ways built into the stack that will allow everyone to circumvent this. Confidential Transactions is one way:
That being said, this still doesn't erase that debt that's owed.
Bitcoin doesn't solve tax debt.
Bitcoin solves "fiat debt". (for lack of a better way to put it)

Interesting. Thanks. I looked it up. It appears that it is not inherently illegal to own/use the domain. Only  a **civil liability** if you have the intent to sell it for financial gain, and that's only if it's brought to court.




 law 15 § U.S.C. 1129
(1) In general
**(A) Civil liability**
* Any person who registers a domain name that consists of the name of another living person, or a name substantially and confusingly similar thereto, without that person’s consent, **with the specific intent to profit** from such name **by selling the domain name** for financial gain to that person or any third party, shall be liable in a **civil action by such person.**
(B) Exception
* A person who in good faith registers a domain name consisting of the name of another living person, or a name substantially and confusingly similar thereto, shall not be liable under this paragraph if such name is used in, affiliated with, or related to a work of authorship protected under title 17, including a work made for hire as defined in section 101 of title 17, and if the person registering the domain name is the copyright owner or licensee of the work, the person intends to sell the domain name in conjunction with the lawful exploitation of the work, and such registration is not prohibited by a contract between the registrant and the named person. The exception under this subparagraph shall apply only to a civil action brought under paragraph (1) and shall in no manner limit the protections afforded under the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) or other provision of Federal or State law.
(2) Remedies
* In any civil action brought under paragraph (1), a court may award injunctive relief, including the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name to the plaintiff. The court may also, in its discretion, award costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party.
(3) Definition
* In this section, the term “domain name” has the meaning given that term in section 45 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1127).
(4) Effective date
* This section shall apply to domain names registered on or after November 29, 1999.

You clearly have some background/prior knowledge, which is a good thing for you, but not for the ecosystem.
If you had more money you'd probably have more time and physical space, so let's lump sum all of that into just "money".
Bandwidth isn't free for most people. I'm fortunate to have an unlimited business account where I live. Most aren't and at ~2MB average block size with SegWit fully active, that's ~8.6 gigabytes a month of just blocks that need to be downloaded.
No other internet usage, no sharing blocks with other people who need them, no relaying transactions and actually being a ***useful*** node.
Double that and now we're at 16 gigs a month.
Again, no other internet usage, no sharing blocks with other people who need them, no relaying transactions and actually being a ***useful*** node.

They wouldn't win because "donate to help my cause" is the same as "donate to help me pay my bills while I work on these things I'd like to work on (my cause)".
Money was payed out to people at the time. That money doesn't appreciate in value after the fact. So when people come knocking saying "look at these millions you haven't used to help the forum" it's very very disingenuous.
All of this has been addressed before as well so when people come knocking saying "why won't you talk about it"...it's been talked about.
The being said I really want no part in the conversation subject matter because I wasn't around and I'm not involved with the forum.
I just think it's really disingenuous to come over from another sub with these accusations when people full well know that it's been discussed before, and then convince a bunch of bystanders that "the truth needs to come out".

Exactly, and when you have ***a lot*** of BCH lying around (because you had a lot of Bitcoin) it becomes cost effective to game the system on what ***was*** a low volume exchange until this began.
Washing $1 million would cost you $7,500, it's pretty cheap for someone who wants to kickstart the snowball, wait a bit, and then dump over time.
It's also pretty cheap for someone who's wrongfully convinced they can change public perception on the coin and have theirs reign over all instead.

It's going to take a long time to start getting the full picture. Every possible question you could have, just ask.
Nodes are the servers that run the Bitcoin software.
Bitcoin doesn't exist without nodes.
The advantage to running a node is when a transaction is sent to you, or when you send a transaction, you ***know*** it's legitimate.
You're able to trust no one but the software you are running.
Currently there are no direct financial incentives to running a node, but the 2nd layer Lightning Network will provide a 2nd layer fee system so nodes can have this much needed incentive.
Our node count is going up over time, but this is mostly due in part to smart developers who have been very good at making the software much more efficient, and ensuring runaway liberalism with the Bitcoin code doesn't occur and destroy the whole thing.
For example, Ethereum's node count has been on the decline because the ability to fun a node has been decreasing over time as the bandwidth and computing requirements have gone up, mostly due in part to unrestricted growth of their blockchain.
Decentralization is Bitcoins primary feature and without it none of this works. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

You wrote a lot in response to the high fee situation but what you must realize is right now fees are consolidated and forced upon the *end user.*
This will be much more widely dispersed as the layers grow and things like signature aggregation are completed.
We're looking at long term viability, not short term relief.
To put that into perspective, nobody was complaining about the Bitcoin fee situation in the 1970s while the Internet was being built, or how billions of people were being marginalized because we didn't address the high fees.
This will all be resolved with time, and Bitcoin is still a work in progress. There should be no expectation that you will enjoy it's usability at the moment, you are a beta-tester so-to-speak.
It's hard to look at it that way when so much money is invested, but that really is the case.

I'm finding that this is the inevitable train of thought people have as they get more involved into the space.
I've posted threads like this myself in the past and I still think we could benefit from at least having exchanges list mBTC side by side on the charts the way Gold shows ounces and kilo prices on the left and right side.
That being said, I think we'll be well into the bits range by the time we have any significant size of the population on board with Bitcoin, so I wouldn't be too worried in that sense.
I still always look at the price in the context of mBTC because it's easier to not get so worked up over price changes that way, but it's not *necessary* at this point to make a switch, although it would be *nice*.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:00:00


Ignorance is permissible, all good.
Devs have found a way to compress more transactions into the current space through various means.
One that has been discussed for a while now is call [**Aggregated Signatures**]( (Schnorr) is a direct compression that should give an increase of ~25%, but I believe it's going to be much more than that when exchanges use the feature to batch all payouts they make into a single transaction.
Another is the Lightning Network, which uses multisignature features to create a payment channel network on top of blocks. This would be an upgrade to full-nodes, which would create a decentralized meshed onion-routing system you can make payments through.
It's ***impossible*** for the blockchain to grow via blocksize. In order to just reach Visa levels we would need astronomically high sizes that would require datacenters to even process the blocks or verify the transactions in those blocks before the next one comes along.
I'd start with [**this video by Andreas**]( and then work through a bunch more on his channel. He has a lot of valuable insight that I can't provide in a Reddit response.

It's either a link, or a box of text.
You can suggest people submit quality content, but you can't enforce it unless you ban all Twitter links, which is absurd (in my view).
You could also take the brand new news and type up a paragraph, and inside that paragraph put a bunch of links including the tweet source, but by then those 3 links to Twitter will have been submitted already and on their way to the top, while you and your grey default "no-picture" icon stands no chance.

Someone probably fat fingered their fees, or messed something up and didn't use a change address.
They could have made the mistake of spending a paper wallet but not in full.
Or one of the wallet out there has a bug in their fee estimation algorithms, or just has a bad algo altogether.

I'm just explaining why others may be reacting the way they do.
So to address some of the stuff in your post:




Fees will continue to rise as demand goes up, it's simply a matter of supply and demand.
The fix would be something that supports the demand while maintaining decentralization.
We could throw everything on a single datacenter and run a super computer and all go home, but that defeats the entire ethos of what Bitcoin is about.
Search for "Schnorr" or "Aggregated Signatures".


No transactions are reversible, double spendable, or "steal-able", at all, and they never will be. I'm sorry that you were lead to believe this may be possible.


All Blockstream is doing in respect to your concern *(to my best knowledge)* is creating an elegant way for businesses to operate sidechains.
Anyone can come along and make a sidechain right now, and some are already working on it, so why not develop a standardized system?
A standardized system for sidechains is going to happen anyway, so why not take the lead to ensure that standard isn't created by an entity that is corrupt at it's roots?
This is what's going on with the Lightning Network. Go search for the BOLT standard that all the different LN projects are working on.

Are you saying that you have no qualms with the continued efforts to scam the community?
Or are you saying you just don't care about people who make stupid risks like this when they could have just held both?
I agree with the latter, but I hope not the former:
99% of the worlds population is being scammed by fiat.
The whole point of Bitcoin is to relieve that: 
It's not a club house/invite only/elitist  system.
It's being designed to relieve the entire population *(including the majority who don't care because they don't understand)* from this burden.
You don't have to care, that's fine, but I do.

I agree with you that `assumevalid=0` needs to be set, and I should probably update the post to specify that, but I don't consider it to be an additional dimension to the conditions *(your other suggestion is, IMO, see below)*.
As for Ethereum being irrelevant, I find that the term archive node also applies to Bitcoin. Should one claim that  is a full node, which allows pruned under that umbrella, then a node that doesn't prune could then be considered an archive node, since it kept an archive of the blockchain. IIRC some Core developers have used this term for those conditions.
It also seems like you're in favor of the requirements for the title of "full node" be more rigorous than even that of  with your suggestion that the node also be an active network participant that can relay and serve IBD. I've seen this suggested a few times but I find it's not a very popular viewpoint. If I took that into consideration then we would get a 3rd dimension to these set of conditions.
[**Someone suggested**]( the possibility that one *could* potentially consider a full node to be one that is merely an active network participant *(I consider this absurd but given your extra dimension, this definition is also now on the table)*. It only has a copy of the current chainstate, didn't validate the history, and does not keep blocks beyond some arbitrary, but short, length of time into the past.

Avoiding [**speculative reason**]( increases the likelihood of being blindsided.
Question everything, it does no harm except to those who are at risk of being exposed.
This is different than "if you have nothing to hide" because the concern of the "if you have nothing to hide" mentality is that of force being applied just on speculation.

No. It's a softfork.

The new rules are compatible with the old rules. A softfork.

There was a Twitter thread that Peter Rizun started.
He was having a conversation with someone about the process he (Peter) went through to test/get-to-know Lightning better.
There was a short back and forth, normal conversation, **until one of the replies came from a different account**.
This specific reply:
* was a direct continuation of the conversation Peter was having
* makes absolutely no sense coming from anyone else
* was deleted almost immediately after it was tweeted
Then after the tweet was deleted, the account was deactivated.
Then when the other person raised this to Peter, Peter blocked that person.
The text used in that tweet when compared to Peter's Twitter vernacular is simply corroborating evidence, not the actual story.
No, not *everyone* uses "b/c" on Twitter, but most who do will use it when their tweets reach max length.
And while I never see anyone use "till",  I'm sure this also isn't *exclusive* to Peter.
Highlighting those words requires the actual story, it's not just a matter of two different accounts using the same abbreviations.

***Satoshi's Choice*** -Presented by Cinemax®
**Setting:** Early 2000's , Silicon Valley , Satoshi's apartment , [some mid 90's black &amp; white flashbacks](
**Theme:** Dark, deep, drastic, dreary.
**Plot:** Satoshi is on the verge of making a tough decision, and he's slowly losing his mind over it. Literally. Drafting a whitepaper for years, he's having difficulty rounding out the edges. Never leaving his apartment and consulting his inner self through a variety of means (drugs, self harm, talking to his pets, and various forms of meditation), Satoshi finds that the closer he gets to the answer, the further he distances himself from reality. He just can't decide: *Is Bitcoin instant coffee.*

You're misunderstanding something. A softfork is still a fork, and it's still effective, it just don't cut off older nodes.
There have been many softforks done already, and they are enforced (effective) due to the majority of nodes demanding those additional rules that were added.
This is what a softfork is.
A hardfork changes or removes rules, which cuts off old nodes. Old nodes can't continue syncing the chain.
You're not articulating yourself enough for me to understand what the misunderstanding is here.

No, the issue here and OP got into ***a technology in its early stage*** without understanding how it fully works, and he's not the only one.
Early adopters take risks. Educated *(on the subject)* early adopters understand those risks. Uneducated early adopters don't and are more likely to experience those risks.
He's one of the rare few who have to deal with this, and it's a lot less "OMG NO WAY" than you are making it out to be.


No. Not at all. Completely incorrect.
If you have an address, and every week you dollar-cost-average your purchases and send them to that address, ***1 address has all the coins.***
If every month you make a new address and send $25 a week to it, every month you'll have an different address with $100 in it.
If you make a new address every time, you'll have A LOT of addresses with $25.
***This is not OP's situation.*** None of it.
OP has A LOT of addresses with ***very small amounts.***
***0.00006101 BTC***
That's $0.07
This is the equivalent of having a hundred dollars in pennies, but the pennies are scattered all over your house, each penny in it's own [***"this."***](
That's about the time I'd say fuck those pennies because the work required to collect them costs time, and time is money.
I could spend that time/energy elsewhere and collect more money that I would wasting it trying to harvest the pennies.
Had I stored those pennies ***properly*** the first time around, none of this would be an issue. They'd be rolled up, or all stored in a piggy bank, or in one of [***these like I currently do.***]( When it's time for me to turn my change into bills, I'm going to head over to the closest bank that has a change machine, or a local supermarket with a CoinStar machine, and get it done really quick.
[***They are going to charge me a 9% fee.***](
The bitcoin network is the same way.
Store your change properly and stop sending micro-payments to separate addresses.
I've never pay or received a micro payment in my life. Building up that much to make an issue like this means OP was doing something very unique to his situation, once again, ***using a new technology he knew nothing about.***

Yes. Exactly this.
There's also this thing called a [**change address.**](
Simply put, if you have 1 BTC and send me 0.3 BTC, that 0.7 BTC you have left doesn't stay put, it goes to a new change address.
This isn't an issue unless you're dealing with receiving AND sending micro-payments.
I don't know the complexity of OP's situation, but it really has to be a unique one if he was constantly receiving nickel/dime payments to new addresses.
MyCelium uses a [**deterministic wallet**]( system where your initial address is fed through an (agreed upon standard) algorithm to determine the next address, so as long as you have the original private key (or seed string for that private key), the algorithm will cycle through and check until it determines you haven't gotten this far down the list.
Whenever you send your Bitcoin, the ***change*** goes to the next address on that list. Every time you send, a new change address is created using the next address on that list.
[**Use this site,**]( and put "a" in the box.
Think of "a" as your "seed string", the output will be: 
Now put that output into the box, the next output will be:

Bitcoin is not a stock.
Even if it were, predicting stock movements is very arguably useless.
Unless you have big money and inside information and computers that game the market with your big money, you'll only make money if you get lucky. The entire system defrauds the average person and the only viable strategy to remove luck from the equation is to buy and hold.
Bitcoin is not a stock.
It's price over long periods of time roughly matches user adoption growth patterns.
Any price speculation therefor should be done by mirroring predictions in user adoption over long periods of time.
ZEC and DASH market caps are irrelevant when both coins turn to shit in the next year. (They're actually shit now but let's just pretend they aren't.)

Your thought process is a logical fallacy but I can't pinpoint the name right now.
It goes something like:
*This is my experience.*
*Everyone says this other experience is an issue but I'm not experiencing that issue.*
*So why is that other experience an issue if I'm not seeing those complications or how that may indirectly effect me.*
Then there's the issue you won't even address which is, the current TX demand is due to ***&lt;.01%*** of the population using this system at a very basic level.
What happens when that becomes 1%?

We're getting to that point where many newcomers just don't know they can buy parts of a Bitcoin, and I don't think anyone is doing any real work to clarify this.
It's one thing to already have a wallet with an exchange and see that you can type in a dollar amount lower than the price.
It's another thing for people who Google something like ["buy bitcoin price"]( and all they see is it's current price on the exchanges main pages.
That leap to setting up an account is the bottleneck in my opinion, and I think having limited access to the fundamental knowledge about how this works can deter that jump.

I don't think you do if you're asking this question.
You can't break apart a transaction and only use the parts you want, ***they need to signed.***
Try and look at it this way:
[set of instructions] + [private key] = signature
Any change in the instructions would make the signature unverifiable.
The set of instructions includes the receiver, you can't change the receiver, you can't change the amount, etc...anything and everything that is unique to this transaction can not be changed.
You could COPY the entire tx and post it to the blockchain, but nothing in that tx has anything to do with you, or any address you own, or any address you want to recieve coins.
You can't do anything to it but post it again.
The network would see a second copy of the tx and ignore it because the network has built in double spend protections.

Correct. The number of people who mine is large.
***Let's talk about their equipment distribution.***


Right...So let's break this down a bit...
Let's say hypothetically, there are 10,000 Bitcoin ASICs, and 1,000 ***people*** (miners).
Does every miner have 10 ASICs?
I'll repeat myself: "The ***argument*** here is that these ***"pools"*** are for a large part, single entities."
The argument is that the ASIC distribution is more like: 1 person has 5,000 ASICs, while the other 999 miners share 5,000 between them all.
Please, before you even bother, ***I won't debate the semantics of those numbers.***
This is an example to express the point of ***uneven distribution.***
But you know this...
You know this very well, just like the other guy I replied to.
Let's be real here, you're ignoring the point and trying to cloud the argument with irrelevant information.
There could be a million people who mine, if a single person has more power than half of those people combined ***that's an issue.***
That's ***the*** issue.

The assumption is Antpool is entirely run by Jihan and his company Bitmain.
The next assumption is many other smaller pools also are in his control but intentionally split to avoid outrage and concerns of centralization and that this 16% number is actually much larger.
Let's not forget ViaBTC (3%), BTC Top (7%), and bitcoin.com pools (2%), all in pretty much fully controlled by a very small group of people.
So that's another 12% on top of the 17% that Antpool has.
People will debate the accuracy of this to no end but understand one thing: The entire mining network is ultimately a very small percentage of the Bitcoin user base and most miners are based in China, under Chinese control, and the coins are instantly sold off for a profit without a care in the world about what's actually going on.
Lightning Network fixes this. Check my post history if you're interested in how.

Mining has evolved way past your understanding of it.
It's extremely costly and profit margins only increase when you have facilities filled with miners, strategically placed in locations where electricity is cheap.
Your electricity may be free now, but it won't be when you're pulling more out of that socket than the entire building you're dorming(?) in. Whoever actually pays that electric bill will notice and come asking.
If you want Bitcoin you're better off buying it, and don't expect it to always go up in price. This is a long term investment.
The amount you'd be paying in equipment that you'd only be using for X amount of time could just go towards buying Bitcoin and holding it.

No you're misunderstanding.
Old clients would still *accept* 1MB blocks, but they wouldn't *demand* them. They wouldn't care if all the blocks that came in were below 300KB.

I disagree. What about people who invest thousands into owning Bitcoin?
They are taking equal risks, just allocating their money elsewhere in the community.
Also, regardless of the system, let's forget Bitcoin for a moment. I don't think it's wise to invest in hardware under the presumption that it will be usable and useful forever.
Computer hardware becomes outdated very quickly.
Nobody owes you anything. There's no owed ROI. There is no bailout. There is no "too big to fail" here...Bitcoin began because that system sucks.
If you're a miner, you made a choice, and you live with those consequences. There are no feelings in this system. 
***I won't feel bad for you.***
Make your decision. If you want to back out, so be it. Back out, go your own way.
There will always be someone else willing to take your spot in this system. That's how this works.
Block reward is an incentive. It's a contract. Take it or leave it. There's no minimum wage. There's no workers union.

Miners are people, yes.
Miners are part of the entire Bitcoin community, yes.
The percentage of the community that miners reside in is a very small percentage of the entire community.
Just like us, miners too can choose to set their Bitcoin nodes to run a UASF. *(If they are even running a node or care about anything at all besides earning Bitcoin and selling it for profit.)*
They can choose to participate in the direction of the Bitcoin protocol by changing their settings if they want.
Nobody is stopping them from doing what they want, and they clearly are doing what they want...
Everybody invested in this system has the option to do what they want, and ultimately, what the majority of people decide on is the direction this system moves towards.
Fire up a node, dedicate the time towards learning how all this works. Allocate some hardware towards contributing to this network we call Bitcoin.
Let your voice be heard.
Or hey...***start mining!***
Miners are people too, why don't you join them? 
What's the matter? Mining isn't profitable for you?
**Do what you want.**
We all decide the outcome.
Just don't be surprised if the community ultimately picks something you may not like.
Don't like that? ***Speak up!*** Get your voice out there and be heard!
Say what you want and offer opinions that are likely to persuade people to have the same opinions as you!
Everyone has a way to involve themselves if you want, but this includes people who don't agree with you.
Like I've already mentioned, you may inevitably find that there are many more people who feel the opposite way you feel, and they have a voice to.
Don't be scared, please, speak up! For the sake of freedom of speech, ***speak up.***
Start up a node, start mining, voice your opinions in public forums. ***Do your part.***
***Or don't...***

If you want to debate semantics over what the real risk equality ratios are I won't engage.
Whether it's 60:40 or 40:60 or 50:50 is irrelevant. They both involve risk and neither is substantially more risky. ***The amount of risk taking is irrelevant.***
Don't agree? Keep reading.


Did I ever claim that the ***act*** of buying mining hardware and mining is more risky?
I believe the implication here is that ***investing money is risky.***
Investing ***more*** money is ***more*** risky.
Buying $2,000 worth of Bitcoin is ***more*** risky than buying $1,000 in mining equipment.
Once again, ***we can debate the profit returns of that mining investment potentially mitigating some of that risk,*** but I won't engage semantic debates over ratios and percents.
***That being said,*** under the presumption that investment risk in purchasing mining equipment is ***mitigated*** by profit returns, ***a larger sum of money can be invested in mining while sharing a much lower risk factor.***
This is in direct contradiction to what ***you claimed I claimed.***
***All this being said...***I'm still lost when it comes to your point...
Are you implying that because miners ***may*** take bigger risks because they ***may*** invest more money than holders (debatable), that they deserve a larger input?

Ok, originally you were very unclear and some of it still doesn't make much sense. Like this:


I don't know what a "real" increase or decrease would even mean.
Anyway, like with the original UASF, miners need a *reason* to switch.
When considering their reason for switching, one should consider why they currently mine whatever it is they currently mine: *because it's valuable/profitable*
Softforks aren't inherently successful. There needs to be enough support for it to make it enticing for a miner. Mining is a contract, and if you write a bad one, nobody will show up to do the work you want them to do.
Many don't think Luke's proposal will ever gain enough traction, including me.
But if it did, and miners keep "*mining 1MB blocks and even if their nodes will be the only ones verifying it*", then they'd be wasting &amp; losing money, because if nobody valued it then price would crash.
No it's not a clean process, and no fork is an easy thing to pull off, but it's not as simple as "miners will just say no and do what they want". I felt that was your sentiment originally, which is why I replied in the beginning.

You don't necessarily lock your own coins.
Sidechains just need verifiable proof that coins are locked and then they can move ~freely within the sidechain depending on that sidechain's functionality. The security models of each sidechain can vary.

My reply wasn't directly towards you either. I was preemptively waving off anyone who might have an issue with me admitting that I'm aware of the fortune bestowed upon me. Of which being born into a 1st world country at the right time and age where I can handle losing a risky all-in/most-in investment like Bitcoin and still recover from losing all my wealth 10 years from now.
As for losing the incentive to spend, comparing Bitcoin's price movements now, instead of what they'll be when it becomes stable, is the wrong way to do it.
At ~2% inflation, for someone with less than $1,000 in their bank account *(most people on this planet)*, you stand to lose $20 a year if you don't spend that $1,000.
At ~2% deflation *(we don't even know how many coins will be lost on average per year)*, someone with $1,000 in their bank account will stand to gain $20 a year if they don't spend their money.
Which one is stopping you from buying food tomorrow?
Do you not buy the new iPhone because in a year you'll make $20 on that $1,000?
2% inflation vs. 2% deflation is so negligible in their differences it hurts to see people put it so black and white.
The reality is it doesn't matter in a system that is consistent in it's rules and the supply schedule can't be controlled by anyone.
Inflation/deflation rates only matter if some central authority is creating the money.

Peter Rizun doesn't consider my node a full node, nor does he think I need to run one. He thinks I should use an SPV wallet and trust the node I'm tethered to to follow and enforce the consensus protocol of my choice.
His method to "achieve" 1GB blocks involves stringing all the transactions together, known by all nodes *(just miners)* ahead of time, and pre-ordered by said miners before they are built into a block.
Forgetting all the other concerns and overestimate necessities I laid out in my other responses, that's 144 GB a day in data, storage and bandwidth.
Not only that, but it has miners come to consensus about what transactions are included in a block, ***before consensus***. The block is consensus, the fee market and a miners personal choice decides what gets included in a block.

I wouldn't jump to conclusions about the users integrity. The issue is it's perceived as a concern/desire and they may not realize that. We don't know unless they elaborate.
It's true though, it's shitty for micro-transactions, and it always was. Lightning is better for that.
The average transaction size is 200 bytes. Even at 1 satoshi/byte, you can't send single, double, or triple digit satoshis in a cost effective manner.
If the price goes insanely high, the default minimum relay fee could be lowered from 1000 sat/kilobyte to 10 sat/kilobyte (.01 sat/byte), but we're long off from that, and it's moot because that's just adjusting for price.
If 1 satoshi = $1, those aren't microtransactions.

Instead of combining all of your inputs into a total balance like most wallets do, this let's you separate those inputs, add anonymity to some coins, which will then become inputs on a brand new address.
You can then send those coins to any other address you want, as payment or storage.
Only, I would avoid recombining these newly created addresses.
Moving them back to cold storage would be fine, so long as when you take them out of cold storage you don't recombine those inputs.

Arguably nothing is voluntary, but I won't get too abstract.
Segwit is voluntary depending on the angle you're looking at it from, and we don't need to obscure what really happened with the word voluntary, in my opinion.
Old nodes don't need to create Segwit transactions, or receive to Segwit addresses.
Old nodes still need to process parts of other people's Segwit transactions.
Old nodes rely on the upgraded network to feed them.
The network upgraded and moved forward, while non-upgraded nodes leech from the network. Moving forward as a softfork is essentially just providing non-upgraded nodes life support. *(Which is the right thing to do...but not the point.)*
It's voluntary the same way using a car is voluntary, but if you want a good paying job and live in an area with no public transportation and your job is an hour away, you need to get inside a car.
If you want a functioning node that *contributes* to the network you need to be Segwit compatible.

Why would the small miner cram low fees into his occasional block if the mempool isn't low?
Does you people not realize that they aren't filling up their blocks and only taking the most expensive, the mempool is clearing but they are ignoring the bottom.
By the time a small miner is able to get a block the mempool will be high again (because the big miners ignore the low fee transactions) and the small miner will just take the higher fees instead because it's more money.
The logic for all of these workarounds really don't hold up.

Not necessarily. The protocol is still being developed but Watchtowers are easily a function of a Lightning node, not their own node. Think of it like a toggle/option.
It's important to first distinguish between LN routing nodes and your LN phone wallet/client.
Additionally, if you don't want to receive, but only open a channel with a routing node to pay via LN, then you don't need a watchtower at all because every previous possible channel state that could be published would grant you with more money than you currently have.

It won't be complicated once it's fleshed out.
A channel can be opened at the same time you receive a payment.
So for example, if you buy from an exchange and want to withdraw to your phone's wallet, that transaction can not only send you your coins, but open a channel with those coins at the same time.
It can also send you all your coins and open a channel with 10% of those coins, all in a single transaction.
That channel could be with the exchange, or you could potentially select a node of your choice. This is the streamlining that needs to/will occur, but it's going to take some time.

Wages stay the same while the value of those wages continually decrease.
Inflation certainly has effects on the poor.
It's much easier for a company to sign a contract with you at X rate, and simply not give you a raise yearly *(or just one not equivalent to the rate of inflation)* because *"you"* didn't perform "well enough", than it is for a company to decrease your salary on a yearly basis to account for an increase in the value of a single dollar.
If you consider how the efforts to raise the minimum wage have enough momentum to actually make changes on that front, because people rallying together have influence *(even when it might be a case of tragedy of the commons)*, then one can equally consider how unlikely a company can continually justify yearly wage decreases for all their employees, because people rallying together have influence, especially when their contracts have the company locked into paying you X rate.
Without inflation, a $10/hr salary that never goes up *is* a yearly raise.

 Statement from Visa and Worldpay for Coinbase customers
 following is a joint statement from Visa and Worldpay:
*Over the last two days, some customers who used a credit or debit card at Coinbase may have seen duplicate transactions posted to their cardholder accounts.*
***This issue was not caused by Coinbase.***
*Worldpay and Coinbase have been working with Visa and Visa issuing banks to ensure that the duplicate transactions have been reversed and appropriate credits have been posted to cardholder accounts. All reversal transactions have now been issued, and should appear on customers’ credit card and debit card accounts within the next few days. We believe the majority of these reversals have already posted to accounts. If you continue to have problems with your credit or debit card account after this reversal period, including issues relating to card fees or charges, we encourage you to contact your card issuing bank.*
*We deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused customers.*

This is just the "intro", there's much more:




channels, is it possible for me to *atomically* send $6 to fulfill a
payment?"**. The answer to this question is "yes", provided that the receiver
waits to pull all HTLC's until the sum matches their invoice. Typically, one
assumes that the receiver will supply a payment hash, and the sender will
re-use the payment hash for all streams. This has the downside of payment
hash re-use across *multiple* payments (which can already easily be
correlated), and also has a failure mode where if the sender fails to
actually satisfy all the payment flows, then the receiver can still just
pull the monies (and possibly not disperse a service, or w/e).


Lightning while (1) not re-using any payment hashes across all payment
flows, and (2) adding a *strong* guarantee that the receiver won't be paid
until *all* partial payment flows are extended. We call this scheme AMP
(Atomic Multi-path Payments). It can be experimented with on Lightning
*today* with the addition of a new feature bit to gate this new
feature. The beauty of the scheme is that it requires no fundamental changes
to the protocol as is now, as the negotiation is strictly *end-to-end*
between sender and receiver.


onion blob to signal our protocol (and deliver some protocol-specific data),
then use additive secret sharing to ensure that the receiver can't pull the
payment until they have enough shares to reconstruct the original pre-image.**

~~I'd imagine the person running this site originally configured nodes to have different colors, and then opted to have all the new ones be the same color for whatever reason.~~
~~So it's potentially just a visual of the earlier nodes, which would also make sense that they appear to have many channels.~~
~~Thing is, if you select some random non-colored nodes you'd find they also have many channels and that the colors lead to a bias in visual representation sometimes.~~
Edit: Apparently the protocol allows you to choose a color?

You might be better asking in for now, but definitely come back because Bitcoin will eventually adopt most of the tech Ethereum's been working on.
That being said, just logically, a contract actually holds the coins on an address and unless you want a hackable (and it will be if you don't do this) contract, it needs to be self regulating, as all of these ICO contracts are.
You could ***potentially*** make a copy (fork) of the contract and issue secondary tokens to everyone who poses tokens in the original contract, ***but that contract won't hold any coins.***
Nobody could redeem their tokens for anything of value on that copy.
An idea I literally just thought of though is, if for some reason you planned ahead, you could lock up 10% of tokens in the original contract that you control, never touch them, and then at some point in the future build a secondary contract that works with the first one, where anybody who transfers their ETH from contract_1 to contract_2 gets the same amount of tokens they had in contract_1, plus a % of the 10% of locked up tokens.
You could also do a curve where early switchers get a higher percentage, which incentives switching sooner, but everyone gets more than what they had in the end.
The only downside to that is, ***you*** lose the 10% holdings.
This would actually be pretty interesting to see because the the developer would lose so much in this process that it would only really encourage a genuine contract transfer, for whatever reason. An upgrade in features, a zero day bug is found and everything could be lost but you be honest to the community and sacrifice some of your holdings for the greater good, etc...

Coin age priority benefits large entities like corporations and governments who have the ability to hold longer while the powers within those systems frequently change hands.
Coin balance priority disproportionately benefits the rich.
3 options:
1. **Allow any node with any amount of coins to stake:** Sybil attacked, favors large entities who can split their coins up more.
2. **Arbitrary hard limit on the amount of coins you need to be able to stake (ie: .01 coins held on a node to stake):** Favors the rich unless significantly low, then requires a protocol change as the price goes up, and still subtly favors the rich**er**.
3. **All nodes can stake with a hard percentage on reward:** Favors the rich.

As am I, I completely agree. I think the point here is being lost: Newcomers don't understand that miners by default act in their own interest and should not be sympathized for when it comes time to upgrade the protocol. I'm not trying to introduce a new idea to an already established individual within the community, I'm trying to inform the new people coming in.
You could say that's useless but then why do we have a sidebar? Why do we have a Wiki? Why do we have a forum or a reddit dedicated to Bitcoin if people don't need to be informed?

All my coins are in cold storage. You might find the address and watch it but you are never touching those coins.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:59:24
Why do you demand numbers and measurements? That was never my argument here.
Things we can probably both agree on:
* There will be a gradient of node connectivity.
* There will be a gradient of balances locked in between those channels.
* Node count will grow over time, so long as the barrier to entry for running a full node remains low.
Anyone who wants to **run** a Lightning node ***(not wallet)***, will not have to worry about centralization risks disconnecting them from the network, unless for some reason they are using their node as a wallet.
For example, if a user is running a node and only connecting to Bitrefill to consistently make monthly payments for something, with the added benefit of being able to sporadically pay other people/services every now and then, that's their choice...but they aren't routing. They could be using a LN wallet instead.
For example, all those nodes connected only to the Blockstream store are doing nothing for the network, and they should have no expectation of security. They are either using their nodes as a wallet *(for stickers)*, just to test it out, or haven't/won't channel with any other nodes because many of the people working on Lightning are recommending not even using the mainnet yet.
The "number of failed routes" chart needs to exclude nodes with a single channel, because they aren't functioning nodes in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:21:08
Maybe a voting system could be developed that gives addresses with tokens a vote by the amount of tokens they hold, and a single address or a set of addresses that control the contract are allowed to add "proposals" to the contract, that have a timeout period (or not, but would have to be funded by the owners indefinitely) and must be voted on by xx% of token holders.
All updates to the contract must be voted on by the token holders, and funded for by the contract owners I'd imagine. You could have the new proposals that are injected get funded by the locked up coins in the contract, but that would diminish the value of each share. I'd never invest or lock my tokens up in something like that, I'm sure others may risk it though. But it is a notable feature that needs to be look at.
Voting rules, vote changing, timeout for the voting period, etc...would all have to be in the original contract, and changes to that would also have to be voted on.
The percentage of tokens held by the contract owners would and should also be a factor in who chooses to invest and let a contract like this propagate.
Keep in mind the contract can always be copied by someone else and done better, with an incentive for people to use that contract instead knowing the contract owners have a smaller monetary stake in it.

That's just not how the protocol works.
There's no way to tell what transactions are spam and what transactions aren't spam.
A node can rate limit how many transactions it holds or accepts from another nodes IP but if a million spam transactions were made the node ***after*** limiting may still only hold 1% legitimate transactions, the rest being spam.
Spam isn't an issue of a nodes bandwidth, it's an issue that clogs the blocks up with worthless transactions.

1: List the developers that agreed to this, and list the developers that didn't. If ***you*** can't do this, you have no business making a post saying "why can't we all just get along."
2: Many of the major ***COMPANIES*** that signed the NYA had voided ***their*** agreement by forking to BCash, mining BCash, or allowing BCash to be traded on their platforms.


Repeat after me: There never was an agreement. There. Never. Was. An. Agreement.
Do you want me to cite countless threads from this sub on that discussion at the time where ***many*** people, including ***many*** of the developers opposed this. We all woke up one day and there was a reddit post about some ***NYA*** we weren't even aware of.


The majority will support the chain we all know and love. BCash and S2X will faceplant into each other.


The way you say "better version of big blocks", actually....just the "big blocks" terminology, is suspect. Either that or you've reeeeeeaaaalllllyyy been mislead by somebody.


This isn't about money, ***this is about ideology.***
Jeff designed S2X without replay protection. He knew what he was doing. Causing chaos. I'm not bowing to that.
2-3 developers total are working on the client and it's barely even close to what would be considered ready to deploy.


Actually, this is doing a great job with that:


Not really. They aren't on board because there's financial liabilities they need to prepare for and Bitcoin isn't this magical amazing thing to anyone but 0.01% of the world. 
You can't even imagine the liabilities Amazon brings on itself by accepting Bitcoin. It won't be an easy process for them if they want to do it safely. Small companies like Overstock take bigger risks to get an edge. Shit could hit the fan at any moment, not everyone is as aloof as some of us to think the government won't attempt some sort of crackdown at some point. So they are taking it slow. ***They know nothing about transaction throughput complications.***


I don't think you understand. ***None of it is necessary.*** And since none of it is necessary, yet some ***companies*** think they can dictate the direction of the protocol, ***we vehemently oppose letting them touch the code.***
***S2X is them touching the code.***

Hopefully this gains more transaction through the morning, I think many people (especially the newbies) weren't expecting "Round 2" so fast.
That being said this is hardly round 2, these proposals are pretty straightforward, but here's a breakdown for the newbies (will correct any mistakes I make as they get pointed out to me):


bitcoin protocol by means of soft-fork activation. These features are
a new opcode, MERKLE-BRANCH-VERIFY (MBV) and tail-call execution
SegWit was an upgrade proposal via soft-fork, likewise MAST is an upgrade proposal that only requires a softfork (no split in the network and backwards compatibility). New code is being addded, but all previous implementations (if you're running an older node) will still be compatible.


redemption to use values selected from a pre-determined set committed
to in the scriptPubKey, but without requiring revelation of unused
elements in the set for both enhanced privacy and smaller script
sizes. Tail-call execution semantics allows a single level of
recursion into a subscript, providing properties similar to P2SH while
at the same time more flexible.
Extra "privacy-forward" scripting features. These are not the same as the way Ethereum contracts function, but this isn't the point of this upgrade. (2-way pegged sidechains can/will enable those types of features without sacrificing the integrity of the base layer.)


applications such as tree signatures (minus Schnorr aggregation) as
described by Pieter Wuille [1], and a generalized MAST useful for
constructing private smart contracts. It also brings privacy and
fungibility improvements to users of counter-signing wallet/vault
services as unique redemption policies need only be revealed if/when
exceptional circumstances demand it, leaving most transactions looking
the same as any other MAST-enabled multi-sig script.
The scripts being added enable (again privacy forward) contracting features that are not apparent until specifically called for, and most transactions will look the same from an outside viewer.


and the use cases compelling enough that we could BIP 8/9 rollout of
these features in relatively short order, perhaps before the end of
the year.
BIP 9 (Miner-activated softfork) - What SegWit ***was.***
BIP 8 (User-activated softwork) - What SegWit ***became***, which forced miners (who were and still are profit seeking entities, ***as they should be***) to just activate SegWit through BIP 9, since BIP 9 couldn't be 'canceled' until a good time into the future, and that was just way too long. (I suspect MAST will be BIP 8 [UASF] to avoid this issue again.)


associated implementation, for which I now invite public review and
Write the code --&gt; Release the code --&gt; Discuss/Test the code --&gt; Vote on the code. This is how it should be done.


















will note that there is one piece of feedback which I agree with but
is not incorporated yet: there should be a multi-element MBV opcode
that allows verifying multiple items are extracted from a single
tree. It is not obvious how MBV could be modified to support this
without sacrificing important properties, or whether should be a
separate multi-MBV opcode instead.

No need to be upset, I'll explain.
I'm well aware the developers have their own channels and procedures and process, this isn't about them, I wasn't talking about them.


This is the only reason for my post. Many people get their information from social media, they get their information through channels like reddit or Twitter. ***I just want to inform the uninformed.***
This isn't about shaming people who are known to regularly communicate via these channels. The "big names" term just means, "the public figures (the every day 'twitterers') who always have something to say". I'm not calling them out, I'm just saying "we don't need ***their*** 20,000 followers to get this in the spotlight, just retweet this and it'll happen."

That's an arbitrary metric. I don't even know how it's calculated.
How far it looks back to make it's calculations is also a big factor in that "estimate". The site says 3 hours, so ~18 blocks.
Are all those blocks weighted equally? If block 2 and block 15 look the same, are they weighted equally (SME) or is it some form of exponential moving average (EMA) or some other curved calculation?
If all of those 18 blocks included 1 sat/byte transactions, except for a single random block from 2 hours ago *(let's call it block 9)* because some random miner didn't include transactions lower than 30 sat/byte in that block, is that block weighted equally as block 9 *would* be weighed if it included 1 sat/byte transactions?


That would make sense, but...that chart is configured oddly. 7 day average doesn't really show the [**whole picture.**](
And while this next one doesn't contradict your statement on the TX rates, it also doesn't look at the amount of *outputs*. Majority of transactions are too/from exchanges and large services. If they started batching their outputs then the transaction count will drop but outputs will continue to rise.

It's not about *helping* the network, the number of nodes aren't as important as the location of those nodes, and the physical number of people they represent because that's a closer metric to the economic value and support of those specific consensus rules.
The network would be "fine" with 3 datacenters, it just wouldn't be decentralized.
Let miners try and change the consensus rules they want to abide by, I'll keep running my node. Let's see what happens then.
My node enforces the consensus protocol I want to run.

You can only standardize it as good practice. The (new) Core client (0.15, or 0.15.1 ?? can't remember) detects 2X nodes and blacklists them, and the reasoning is specifically because it lacks replay protection if I recall correctly. We could build in some form of signaling that implies you plan on forking, which wouldn't get blacklisted, if it's protocol based and forces a split, but that would require some form of signaling I can't imagine with my limited expertise.
The best you're going to get is the community deciding on a standard practice of "signal away with replay protection or get your nodes blacklisted in the next client update".
You can't logically ban different code because *they* (developers ***or*** attackers) can just build a tertiary network around that code and accept the old code (this is what a soft-fork really is).

I don’t hoard Bitcoin, I buy it with my extra income and spend what I need to when I need/want something. People living “paycheck to paycheck” will always live paycheck to paycheck. They’ve done this for thousands of years and they can wait to have access to uncensorable transactions for their paycheck to paycheck life for another 10 or so until this thing is potentially ready.
I’m extremely unconcerned about the people “of now”, and more concerned about all the people “of the future”. This isn’t being built to make us happy that this idea we were shown was realized in our lifetime, this is being built so lifetimes ahead of us have a sound system of value transfer.
Until then I hold because I’m fortunate enough to, the same way some were fortunate enough to buy .com stocks. The fact that I hold with the expectation of a price increase is completely separate from my desires to see this thing take off as a technology.
One (my understanding of it) causes the other (my fortunate life) to invest. It’s not the other way around so please spare me with any sort of implication that we all hold/hoard and that because we want to see a profit/return we try to direct the protocol in that fashion. It’s absurd.
Ease of transfer is a utility. Frequently transferred is inferred by you, but still a utility.
Being able to hold coins on a address and never risk them being taken, and know that they’ll always be the same percentage of the total supply, is also a utility.
Bitcoin was never and still is nowhere close to being “production ready”. It’s a live alpha and it’s utility functions are constantly being tested.
Where improvements can be made they’ll be made. When issues prop up as a result of higher demand/unexpected outcomes, adjustments will be proposed or utility will be lost and the market will decide the value of that lost/impeded utility.
If Bitcoin is to gain mass adoption, even just as a means of sound money that force governments to properly compete on a global scale, it’s value will be much higher than it is now. So temporary utility loss while scaling drawbacks are discovered, and/or worked around, will be “eaten” by the growing price discovery for all the other utility Bitcoin provides.
Uncensorable transactions for everyone unregulated by anyone’s control can never happen in a system where the base layer functions can only be executed by datacenters. Whatever system that manages to provide that feature for all must ensure that same quality or else it will succumb itself to centralized control.
If you think you have a solution for Bitcoin that maintains that property, please, propose one.

If you told me "some nodes have to go" and I had no choice, and then you asked me if I'd rather take the top 10 countries by node count (9,116) or the bottom 90 (2,608), I'd pick the bottom.
Decentralization can't just be measured by what *some* people in 1st world countries can afford.
For what it's worth, if I didn't live with people, I wouldn't have the bandwidth to operate a fully functioning node.
"2MB" + Segwit is really 4MB of data per block, 6 blocks an hour, times 24, and then 30 days for a whole month of just data downloaded. Then you have to upload *at least* an equal share of data to other nodes else you aren't helping *enforce* the protocol or contributing to the network.
`4MB * 6 * 24 * 30 * 2 = 34.56 gigabytes` of data a month to be part of this network if we doubled the block throughput at the moment. That's the bare minimum, it doesn't count other factors, and it doesn't count any other things you might use the Internet for.

You can just use software offline to derive the address from the private key you have, if it matches the address with the coins you're looking at then you know it's good. You don't need to spend the coins to verify they match.
Every time I put more into my cold storage I rederive my address just to ensure I'm not making a mistake, and to further ingrain the derivation method into my head because I don't keep my real private keys lying around.

What about having the LN node Alice runs default configured to watch all of Bobs channels?
As in, every node watches all the channels of the 2nd degree by default. Then you can filter/limit noise, and if you're being sent more Watchtower data than the amount of channels you know they have open you know something is up.
Are there privacy concerns to that? Is the "anon"-Watchtower data ~equal in size across the board to have some rough way of measuring that?

To add to this, the block likely wouldn't even propagate unless the miner kept an endless supply of node IP's.
The nodes receiving the invalid block *(whether by hash or by weighted difficulty)* wouldn't send it back out to any other node because it's invalid.
Pretty sure nodes also auto-ban repeat offenders.
Plus, many nodes (non-listening) only connect to a specific set of other nodes, so if the miner tried to send the block to those, it wouldn't even be accepted.
I drew up a [**small example**]( so you can try and get the idea.
The green node *(or miner)* is the offending sender, and sends the block out to the nodes it's connected to *(the blue nodes)*. Those blue nodes determine the block is no good and don't send it out to their other connections. The offending block will never reach the red nodes.
At actual network scale that has even more of an effect, as this example makes it seem like half get "infected". It would barely even be a blip on the radar.

Most clients/nodes are running Segwit compatible consensus code.
A future upgrade that might softfork in Confidential Transactions would then have "CT" coins by your definition...all of those clients will also be Segwit compatible.
Hashpower doesn't determine the code we run, the code we run determines whether the blocks that "the hashpower" makes are valid or not.
They can either step in line or not create any blocks, which is an opportunity cost for them.

The network is fine with 3 data centers, but that doesn't make it decentralized.
All of the nodes on AWS/Alibaba? Not decentralized.
All of the nodes in a single country? Not decentralized.
All of the nodes being run by a single entity? Not decentralized.
Take the current network and divide it into 10 separate entities, they'll all work.
Your node doesn't "help" the network, your node enforces the consensus rules you agree with and maintains decentralization redundancy. The more the merrier.
The network is "helped" by consensus rules like the 10 minute block time average and block size restrictions.
Wanna help the network? Help enforce those restrictions by running a node with those consensus rules, even if it's a Raspberry Pi.

Just in case, because redditors are redditors: I think the devs behind Electrum are doing a great job, my suggestions below are tangential.
This is what I want to see in fee estimations *(please tell me where this falls apart)*:
None of the following is a running algorithm. This is done on the side, the end value is used as a reference.
Look at all of the past blocks.
Take the lowest 5% of transactions in each block by sat/byte, average them.
Each block now has a "min sat/byte average" value.


Look at `Block_100`'s value, look at `Block_101`'s value.


Measure the increase or decrease. In this case, it was a 100% increase.
Do this for ***every*** block increment.
235--&gt;236 = +100%
236--&gt;237 = +75%
237--&gt;238 = -50%
238--&gt;239 = +20%
500,000--&gt;500,001 = +34%
500,001--&gt;500,002 = +67%
Take the biggest percentage change ever recorded, multiply by 1.1.
That's your value for X, now plug X into your "get this tx in the next block asap" algorithm.
Look at the last block that was mined, take it's bottom 5% average, calculate the max possible movement upwards, and ***never have the wallet estimate over that.*** (With exceptions if other variables are found to be = true.)
Now that you have a proper "max fee", you can start calculating the other fees based on mempool depth and other data.
If there's an issue with this please be my guest, we can discuss it, work out the logic, compensate for missing factors.
All of which can be coded into an algorithm, shared. refined, copied by Coinbase, etc...
I just think if there's a proper way to guess the maximum necessary fee, with RBF on *just in case*, you'll stop seeing as many dramatic climbs from stupid algorithms competing with each other for the top spot.

When we talk about inflation (any economist), we mean ***the devaluation*** of the ***unit***.
When the Zimbabwe Dollar [**hyper-inflated**]( the ***purchasing power*** of a single unit went ***down.***
The value compared to that of the USD went ***down.***
When Bitcoins price goes ***up*** compared to other currencies, this is not [**inflation**](

You're right. It is, but when you're playing with a jump rope in the schoolyard and a 5th grader comes over and starts grabbing it, you won't win the tug of war by standing in the middle and saying "Well how can I look at this objectively?"
It's ***your*** responsibility as an outsider (school yard monitor) to try and look at the tug of war objectively, but without insiders on both sides being adamant about their views, the opinions of people on the outside start to skew towards the group that tugs harder.
In one instance, the child could have been told by a teacher they can use the rope for 10 minutes but they have to share, then after handing one handle of the rope off to the other child who's turn it was next, they decided they actually didn't want to share and tried pulling it back to keep playing.
In another instance, it's entirely possible the child brought the jump rope with them to school from home. Is the child now at fault for tugging and screaming as hard as he can because his rope is being stolen?
As an outsider, how do you decide?
***You*** look at it objectively. That's your job in every aspect of life. External forces aren't obligated to satisfy your internal preferences.
Objectivity has it's place, but ***calling bias is just as subjective as being biased.*** I'm allowed to feel like I'm not being biased as much as you're allowed to feel like I am, and neither of us are wrong for doing so.

Seems like the answer is linked below:


For everyone else, a little clarity surrounding the question:
**(false)** If signature aggregation works on old addresses, you can sit on an address/wallet with thousands of inputs and not care about fees for all those inputs, because when it comes out you can just aggregate it all whenever you want to spend.
**(true)** If signature aggregation doesn't work on old addresses, you'll need to consolidate at some convenient time before when fees are as low as you'd like them to be. Even then, after consolidating, you'll need to send those coins into a "AggSig" compatible wallet.

Initial block download *(downloading the normal way)* is almost if not just as good as torrenting now.
Most likely any delay you experience will come from validating the chain, so you'll be waiting to download it, and then waiting to validate it all on top of it anyway.
Pruning just dumps the old data after it's been validated, if you download it from a torrent you'll need to download it all because you haven't validated any of it yet.
If you prune, you can prune as you go and only ever have a few gigabytes of data on your disk at one time.

They'd have to mine a smaller block, which I imagine could be accounted for somehow.
If the block prior was letting in 100 sat/byte transactions, and you can see that's where the mempool is, if a new block comes out of nowhere with the lowest transaction being 1000 sat/byte, that can be detected, and the block would have to be much smaller because there won't be many 1000 sat/byte transactions going around.
As for happening without exploitation, I don't think that's ever been the case in back-to-back blocks.
Maybe for the max sat/byte fee, but not for the minimum. 20x is a lot. *(at the higher rates)*
We'd need the actual data though.
A bell distribution curve would be nice too, so we can see how far away the "max increase of the min" is from the norm.

Not really. 1 sat/byte transactions now are 4-5 times as costly as they were in the beginning of this year. Spam is more expensive now simply because of the rise in price.
Refusing 1-5 sat/byte fees is strictly done to keep the average fee higher, which increases the miners profits.

How could you possibly associate my post with that subreddit?
When (if) the 2x fork happens, will you be siding with the miners or siding with the Core devs who openly oppose the fork?
It has nothing to do with what the fees are. The miners are actively ignoring and not including transactions into blocks that can easily fit them, because they want to keep fees higher by not letting the average fee drop down and by not letting the mempool clear.
Have you not read ANY of my other responses in this thread? I understand how it works, this is to draw attention to it so no one feels sympathy (for a mining conglomerate that is only out to make money) when the next fork comes along and they are deciding which one to pick.
I don't know about you, but I'm with the Core devs on this one, so maybe you should go over to @_date: 2017-09-30 16:49:40
No, they didn't, because pushing 2X was part of their plan. So they are holding the coins on the Bitcoin chain so when there's a split, they dump all of their 2X coins and buy BCash coins, so they can pump the BCash price without sacrificing their original Bitcoin holdings at all.

[**This Ethereum node**]( paused *(presumably to add more storage)*, and has been ***trying*** to catch back up *(from where it was, not even the beginning)* for 2 months.
You're telling me you did a full sync a week ago? Fast sync isn't a full sync. We don't worship Vitalik here so when he says the only important element is the current state, we don't just blindly agree with him.


This just isn't true. My friends miner isn't broadcasting the new block to every node on the network. This is peer-to-peer, and it needs time to propagate, and you know this:


Nodes need this too, else they can't enforce the consensus code they choose to run. Not only do these blocks need to propagate, you need to account for variance in block discovery *(many blocks found in the same few minutes)*, and multiple chains so a node can properly reorg if it needs to.




Not true. If you outlined your tests and published the results I'm sure many people would take a look at it, but be prepared for heavy criticism regarding how the testing was done, way numbers were potentially rounded/assume, and anything you may have missed. All of which would require retesting and further peer review.

Proof of Stake options:
1. Reward everyone who stakes equally.
2. Reward everyone who stakes by ***X*** percentage of stake.
You could reward everyone equally no matter what, then you split up your coins into the smallest denomination and stake that.
**Example:** Reward is 1 coin. You have 5 coins, split them up into 5 address and stake 5 nodes. 5x reward. Compared to someone with 2 coins, who only gets 2x reward.
*Favors the wealthy.*
You could set a minimum amount required to stake to avoid splitting coins up into 0.0001 denominations to stake.
**Example:** Minimum stake limit is 10 ETH. I have 10 and can stake. You have 5 and can't. I collect, you don't. Someone with 20 splits it up into two 10s and stakes twice. They collect 2x. No matter what that limit is (Ethereum is 32 ETH for staking) it excludes poorer people.
*Favors the wealthy.*
You could reward everyone 1% return on their stake.
**Example:** I have 100 ETH, my reward will be 1 ETH per 'cycle', 'turn', 'state change', whatever the term your chain uses. You have 1 ETH, your reward will be 0.001 per that same cycle.
*Favors the wealthy.*
 WAIT WHAT ABOUT STAKING POOLS
Pool_1 has 25% of the network staking with them, with a total of 25,000 ETH staked.
Pool_2 has 10%, with 10,000 ETH staked.
**Example:** You are in Pool_2, ***who collects less reward by %***. So less is divided between the users compared to Pool_1 (10% vs 25%). Why are you there? You don't know. You go to Pool_1 to collect more. Everyone does this.
*Now one pool controls it all.*
**Example:** You are in Pool_2, ***who collects reward by staking the minimum 10 ETH, in 1,000 different nodes/addresses***, they collect the reward...x1,000. Pool_1 does this too, but with their 25,000 ETH. They collect the reward x2,500. Why are you with Pool_2 again? You don't know, you leave. So does everyone else.
*Now one pool controls it all.*
**Example:** You are in Pool_***3*** with 0.5% of the networks total stake. Why the fuck are you in Pool_3 again?

Have you ran tests to support these claims?
You are able to successfully download, validate, and share a 50MB block every 10 minutes? No bandwidth caps? Ethereum nodes aren't even doing that much work and they can't even sync up from scratch at this point...
Also, even if this were true this isn't just about you, the ***network*** needs to be able to support this. I make a block and send it to you, you successfully download and validate it in 1 minute, you send it out to other peers now they have to do the same, until it reaches everyone.
Even if we assume 6 degrees of separation, the restraints need to allow for this.
The network needs to be in sync, that's one of the reasons we have a 10 minute block time to begin with.
Do you mine? Do you have a miner running at home?
What happens when you don't get that new block until 3 minutes after it's been found?
You're 3 minutes late on finding the next block.


Can't wait for this mantra to disappear.

They'd be losing a lot of money in the process. Then the Core devs will come and save Bitcoin with an emergency Proof of Work change to stave off the S2X attack, then all the miners are shit out of luck.
They know this will happen if they do this, so they won't do it.

If you know how to build a computer, just build a low end one with a quality hard drive if you want to preserve the entire blockchain. Download Core 0.15 and run it. It's really pretty simple to set up if you're in Windows.
If you're on Linux/Unix then simple means something completely different to you anyway so either way it's pretty straightforward.
Otherwise, if you don't want to buy a hard drive w/~200 GBs of space (right now you only need ~140 GB), you could just prune the blockchain down to 550 MB. Combined with the "chainstate" it's ~4 GBs, which you can always back up in case of a failure and continue syncing from that date.
Personally I recommend keeping as much of the chain as you can, so you can share it with other nodes that need those blocks to sync.
Even something around 5 GB pruned helps because recently disconnected nodes need to catch up the last X amount of days they may have missed. The more you can keep the better.
What I don't recommend for a minimal effort &amp; stable node is a Raspberry Pi3, I have one, and I have issues. None of which can't be worked through, but I just wouldn't recommend it.

My understanding of the way contracts work is once they are out there they are out there. The contract is decentralized in nature, addresses only control access to the contract based on what the contract associates with that address.
You could make a contract that gives yourself control of what goes on, but then it isn't trustless. ICO's can't be that way, but a government issued token could be...
Or, a companies contract, via government regulations, could be that way.
But all of these are susceptible to being hacked, and might as well not exist on a blockchain, but in a database.

~~SPV clients are broken.~~
Bread is broken.
It’s an even worse example of the current situation.
If you’re using ~~SPV~~ *Bread specifically*, you don’t get a copy of your coins in this case because their HD private key system uses a different generation format that you can't easily take to anoth
You have to ***trust*** that Bread will make it easy for users to export their coins after 2X happens, if it's ever possible.
And no, it can be argued in hardfork, but it is still never applicable.
For example: I’m pro UASF. UASF ***leverages*** the longest chain concept. That doesn’t make the potentially limited (20) amount of nodes running an arbitrary UASF the Bitcoin. UASF works in numbers. It’s why miners began signaling for SegWit, not because of 2X.

As in, if the max increase ever observed was a 20% jump in sat/byte between two blocks?
I have a feeling you'd never see accidental fees *(like 400 sat/byte when the last block was letting in 55 sat/byte)* ever again.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:59:36
You could prop up 100,000 sybil nodes running pre-Segwit software, it's not changing anything. Our nodes will reject any invalid block according to our rules.
This includes any attempt to spend coins that legacy nodes perceive as "anyone can spend".
It would result in a hardfork of the chain at that point, if you could even manage to pull the hashpower to maitain that fork, and the Bitcoin network will continue on it's path because the Bitcoin network is Segwit compliant.

**Edit:** People, I never claimed that this was an ***issue*** with how fees or economics work. ***This is how they work.***
The concept isn't difficult to understand: Miners are self serving, they do what makes them the most money, not what most positively effects Bitcoin. 
***Factor that in*** during scaling debates. 
***Factor that in*** when the protocol forks.
***Factor that in*** when you start feeling like you might have sympathy for them.
Another interest thing to note is that when you zoom out, [**a stair-like pattern**]( of low fee transactions have developed.
Every 30 minutes ~125 kilobytes of transactions are sent to the network.
Before I make any accusations, there are at *least* two possibilities:
1. Some large entity/business who processes a lot of Bitcoin transactions has decided to spread out their low input transactions to help mitigate the instant rise in fees that normally comes along with a huge injection like that. [**Exhibit A.**](
2. Someone is trying to spread out their spamming in an attempt to disguise it.
Seeing as these transaction "injections" are extremely periodic and similar in size, is anyone up to the task of trying to find them and analyze them?

So long as you agree to put that "or" there, then I'd generally agree with you, *but*, we need to define "help".
The network could consist of only 3 nodes running in datacenters and everyone could connect via SPV to one of those 3 nodes, and all the miners could feed the blocks they find to one of these 3 nodes.
That network "works" fine, it's just not decentralized.
So what do you mean by "help"?

Exactly. Big miners make short term gains by doing this to force higher fees, but sacrifice long term market share because...

Transaction fees are already significant proportion of each block reward, and it will only go up from here.
Mining profitability is regulated by hashpower, which determines how often blocks get mined, but then blocks get re-regulated by the difficulty, which adjusts based on total hashpower.
Bitcoin mining will always be profitable, regardless of the current reward.
The issue at hand is, the groups profiting off of mining are shrinking and shrinking, "pools" get larger and larger (Bitmain).
Over time this will re-disperse as mining becomes more widespread and built into things more available for the average person, but we aren't there yet, so the main goal now until that happens should be resisting mining conglomerates and their i'll intentions.
This is why I fully support a PoW change at some point in the future.

This issue here is, the tweet does almost nothing to contribute to a meaningful discussion about increasing the pool of people who ***can*** run a node.
Everyone major in this space knows this, and everyone major in this space knows that it's about keeping the ***availability*** of running a node down, ***behind*** the curve of exponential technological growth so the pool of people that ***can*** (not will) grows larger.

A miner can follow the PoW algorithm to a T, create their own coins, and make transactions that aren't valid all under "the PoW algorithm".

Regarding your upwards of $80 cost in fees...this is an Input/Output issue that is addressed with an upcoming upgrade called [**Aggregate Signatures**]( I employ you to read that article in full.


I want to say this with confidence but nobody can guarantee anything:
SegWit will be in full effect, and it's net gain of ~1MB on top of the original 1MB will be in effect as well.
This doubles throughput. It will be used en mass. Ignore the trolls.
Aggregate Signatures will be activated, or pending activation. **The code is ~complete.** (This is what I've been told by devs.)
This compresses what currently fits into a block. Estimates are around 25%+.
Personally I think it will be even higher when exchanges start batching all of their payouts to everyone in a single transaction every 10 minutes to average 1 TX per block, per exchange. 
Currently exchange transactions look like this: 
See the long list on ins and outs? With AggSig that basically gets compressed down to 1 in and 1 out. That's ***a lot*** of data when you consider all the transactions exchanges make are like this.
People are really underestimating the benefit this feature has down the road. **It's significant**, and never gets talked about by big block trolls.
LN wallets will be live, and I'll be running a LN node, you're welcome to be one of my payment channel peers.
In terms of scaling, there really isn't much of an issue at the moment.
Fees are high because miners are abusing their power to collect high fees. All they have to do is throw a bunch of fake transactions to themselves with high fees into a block they make, and they collect all those fees back to themselves. Yet everyone else needs to keep bumping up their fees to compete for block space with the miners fake fees.
The centralized miners don't want these solutions above happening because it drastically reduces their ability to scam the system, and significantly cuts into their profits.
Don't buy into the 2X FUD and take a chill pill, everything will be fine.

***Actual people*** who use said chain.
Centralized nodes don't add any value to a system that is meant to be distributed and decentralized.
You could create your own branch of Bitcoin and spin up 10,000 nodes and "signal intent" (whatever the fuck that means) all you want:
1. It'll be noticed.
2. They'll be ignored if they run different code.
It's important to note here, the UASF movement was a movement of ***users***. This entire system is much more than just a protocol that runs and works on it's own, if it was it would've been perfect and stayed the same since day 1 when Satoshi launched it.
It hasn't. It's had many upgrades which were decided upon by the people invested into the system.

It's not about the total supply, it's about the distribution method. The actual number is arbitrary so long as there is a "whole" you can measure percentages from, and whether there's a release schedule or not is generally a *really* important factor.
With ERC20 tokens 100% of the "whole" is released all "at once". Typically, one entity will keep 33%, sell 33% to initial investors, and then ICO the other 33%.
You can break those numbers down however you want, but the coin distribution is really bad whichever way you do it. It's also a contract, which can be controlled and edited by the key holder(s) of said contract.

Not as a percentage of the whole.*
Yes, it's deflationary, but what is the real rate of deflation? Not how much was lost in it's infancy, but what percent in a year, after the presumed mass adoption period is 10-20 years behind us?
The purpose of that question is to get to the next conclusion: "Let's build in inflation that counters the loss over time, so the supply actually stays the same."
This can't be done, because now an inflation schedule precedent is set, which means it can become a political target for change. This thing ***requires*** a set, and unrelenting hardcoded supply.
.000001% inflation is negligible.
.000001% deflation is negligible.
If we could guarantee either of those, by some magical universal proof, I wouldn't even care which one it is, I'd take it.
But we can't, so we go with a hard code, and accept that until some point in the future there will be coin loss, which is countered already by coin creation, until that stops on 2140.


By 2140 the amount of deflation from coin loss will be negligible, so I find the tax/"greater claim" argument to be a little too much.
So to reiterate: As percentage of the whole, your claim *(as a majority stake holder)* will increase when coins are lost, ***very very marginally***, after 2140.

There are some interesting ways miners can behave that could potentially result in them being more profitable than the *(typically referred to as)* "honest" method, as well as ways they could try and censor transactions.
The most profitable of these methods *(with the current consensus rules)*, including the honest method (R1), is determined by [**how much hash power and network connectivity**]( those miners have.
How these can *potentially* be defended/mitigated against via various proposed consensus rule changes, [**like this one**]( and how they perform compared to each other.

I don't see it that way nor do I agree with the sentiment.
My heart was equally as important/valuable to my body as a baby as it is now. The work it did then is also equal to the work it does now.
Your 99% of the total supply will always have 99% leverage.
You're 1 BTC will always have the same leverage no matter how big the economy grows. You can't gain more than 1 BTC sitting on the sidelines, and you'll need to spend some to support yourself over time if you aren't earning more in some other way.
In the current system, people with a lot of money "earn" money by investing and doing no work, but all they are really doing when they invest is trying to hedge, so their percentage of the whole stays as close to the same ratio as possible *(or hopefully goes up)*.
It's actually no different than this new system for them, and they have no incentive to work at that point besides greed. They could invest their 1 BTC and hope that percentage goes up *(same happens now)*, but the key difference between these two systems is not what it does for the already wealthy *(nothing)*, but for the poor.
Barrier to entry into the "hedging" aspects of the economy is very high with the current system, and there are many things in place to try and keep it that way. With Bitcoin, this is "on" by default, for everyone *(assuming mass adoption).*

Developer is Here's my comment from that thread:
Hopefully this gains more transaction than it did this morning....
Here's a breakdown for the newbies:


bitcoin protocol by means of soft-fork activation. These features are
a new opcode, MERKLE-BRANCH-VERIFY (MBV) and tail-call execution
SegWit was an upgrade proposal via soft-fork, likewise [**MAST**]( is an upgrade proposal that only requires a softfork (no split in the network and backwards compatibility). New code is being addded, but all previous implementations (if you're running an older node) will still be compatible.


redemption to use values selected from a pre-determined set committed
to in the scriptPubKey, but without requiring revelation of unused
elements in the set for both enhanced privacy and smaller script
sizes. Tail-call execution semantics allows a single level of
recursion into a subscript, providing properties similar to P2SH while
at the same time more flexible.
Extra "privacy-forward" scripting features. These are not the same as the way Ethereum contracts function, but this isn't the point of this upgrade. (2-way pegged sidechains can/will enable those types of features without sacrificing the integrity of the base layer.)


applications such as tree signatures (minus Schnorr aggregation) as
described by Pieter Wuille [1], and a generalized MAST useful for
constructing private smart contracts. It also brings privacy and
fungibility improvements to users of counter-signing wallet/vault
services as unique redemption policies need only be revealed if/when
exceptional circumstances demand it, leaving most transactions looking
the same as any other MAST-enabled multi-sig script.
The scripts being added enable (again privacy forward) contracting features that are not apparent until specifically called for, and most transactions will look the same from an outside viewer.


and the use cases compelling enough that we could BIP 8/9 rollout of
these features in relatively short order, perhaps before the end of
the year.
BIP 9 (Miner-activated softfork) - What SegWit ***was.***
BIP 8 (User-activated softwork) - What SegWit ***became***, which forced miners (who were and still are profit seeking entities, ***as they should be***) to just activate SegWit through BIP 9, since BIP 9 couldn't be 'canceled' until a good time into the future, and that was just way too long. (I suspect MAST will be BIP 8 [UASF] to avoid this issue again.)


associated implementation, for which I now invite public review and
Write the code --&gt; Release the code --&gt; Discuss/Test the code --&gt; Vote on the code. This is how it should be done.


















will note that there is one piece of feedback which I agree with but
is not incorporated yet: there should be a multi-element MBV opcode
that allows verifying multiple items are extracted from a single
tree. It is not obvious how MBV could be modified to support this
without sacrificing important properties, or whether should be a
separate multi-MBV opcode instead.

@_date: 2018-02-11 15:16:35
Using the top 5% is probably the worst thing to do because there’s a consistent flow of excessively high sat/byte transactions at the top because of bad algorithms and people who just don’t care/realize.
But...the bottom 5% doesn’t have to be taken. 0 fee transactions can be accounted for when taking the averages. You could also take the bottom 2-6 percentile and average that, to hedge off the bottom of the barrel.
You could even take the bottom 4-9 percentile and compare graphs. If one looks too spontaneous while another looks smooth, use that one and recalculate.
Instead of multiplying by 1.1, multiply by 1.11, or something along those lines.
I think my point is, this can all be analyzed and simulated, and at one point it’s going to get done, if not soon.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:32:07


Why does this continue to perpetuate?:


This is a protocol process clients running ***the same code*** use to maintain a single chain. They're called client ***reorganizations.***
They have ***nothing*** to do with upgrades or contentious chain splits.
The whitepaper refereed to nodes picking the longest valid chain to determine validity ***within consensus rules***. 
All upgrades, contentious or not, break consensus rules...
So why are we still allowing these things to be conflated?


When? At what point? Who at Coinbase?
Why can't we be given metrics ***now*** that will be used and dispute them ***now***, before any of this happens?

There's no agenda here.
There are facts, and then there is discussion over what we can/should do about those facts.
That discussion would most certainly include your concerns over what other communities might say, and how they'll try to leverage a decision/change like this, and they are very justified concerns.
I don't think a PoW change will ever happen unless a new vulnerability is found or there is a major attack going on.
But...as far as facts go, hashpower as security is only a valuable metric in context.
The inputs required are as follows:
1: How much hardware currently exists that can produce these specific types of hashes?
2: What is the Gini coefficient of that hardware distribution?
3: How difficult/costly is it to completely wreck that distribution and take over *(or even come close to taking over)* the network.
The call for a PoW change from Cobra is a concern over 
What should be debated is:
* Whether that's actually a concern.
* If a PoW change is the best solution to that concern.
* The very potential risks of making such a change to the network.
I personally do not think the concerns outweigh the risk of forking the PoW at this current time. *(had to edit to clarify, worded poorly)*

I think he wants to dedicate one to prioritizing, which I actually don't recommend. Prioritizing low fees keeps the high fees in the mempool, which only makes future fees even higher as people keep trying to grab at that first spot in the blockchain (the next block).
That being said, these instructions should be applied to all of your miners, as it only lowers the barrier of entry for transactions. Fuller blocks aren't impeding your or anyone else's miner.

All related to reorganizations.
Also says:


I think if you keep reading further down you'll see the use of "honest nodes", which mean "within ***consensus*** nodes".
Dishonest nodes are nodes that ***break consensus*** rules. Rules such as the 21 million cap, and rules like a 2MB hardfork.
This is a ***communication*** feature. It helps keep the mesh network together when they are all running the same code.
Changes to that code require a ***different form of consensus***, a social one.
So let's be careful not to conflate "reorganization consensus" with "upgrade/protocol_changing consensus".
SegWit consensus was a social agreement to change the code, it just happened to ***leverage*** reorganization consensus to make upgrading easier by being backwards compatible.
That doesn't make it intrinsically better or worse than a hard fork, just safer at the current point in time.
Likewise, a 2MB hard fork ***doesn't leverage*** reorganization consensus, it ***supersedes*** it.
Again, that doesn't make it intrinsically better or worse than a soft fork, just not as safe at the current point in time.
So to reiterate: Reorganization consensus is not applicable to upgrade consensus. Companies need to stop copping out
Just to further address this, a prior comment you made the other day says:


You are correct that 2X doesn't try to reorg the chain.
You're incorrect in that it's not invalid, because like I've stated: 2X tries to supersede the chain altogether.

Welcome to Bitcoin.
The only solution to this is more decentralization, there is no workaround besides making "malicious" transactions more difficult to do without hindering other transactions that may look like malicious transactions.
This is the "spam" debate. Aggregate Signatures helps this.
This is only profitable if you control a significant portion of the hashpower, otherwise you'rte just neglecting to collect potential profits from ***real*** transactions.
Only two solutions I can think of:
1. Wait for more decentralization and deal with it, just keep calling them out until then so the community is aware of it.
2. PoW change to level the playing field until mining becomes more accessible to the world.

Lightning is the real game changer for economic full node incentive. Every Lightning node *(not wallet/light client)* is an economic Bitcoin full node.
In the long run, the system will be secured by infrastructure that relies on the layers below it, each one being more secure than the one above it.
The simplest way to conceive this is to use what we already have as an example, and then try to extrapolate.
Currently we have a huge network of nodes all enforcing a specific consensus protocol. We can't quantify how decentralized it is by a single number, but we can measure a bunch of metrics and take a guess as to what would increase/decrease those metrics.
For example, there are about 100 different countries where Bitcoin nodes exist in at this point. Ideally, we want them in all countries, and we want *many* in all countries run by actual individuals, so that within a single country there is no central point of failure, or target for regulation/attack. We ensure this by making sure a node remains cheap to run and maintain, while letting technology *(like hardware &amp; bandwidth)* **catch up** for the rest of the world.
Lightning builds on top of this network of nodes, and entices businesses to make extensive use of it because of it's simplicity and usefulness without all the complications of block fees, block times, multiple confirmations, etc...
Here's a simple question: What happens when someone comes along and tries to copy the Bitcoin chainstate/blockchain history and create a fork of Bitcoin? I'll tell you this much, *you can't take the Lightning nodes with you.*
You can prop up thousands of fake nodes on Amazon or Alibaba, and install your own version of a lightning network on top of it, but they would also all be on Alibaba, and have nothing in comparison to the actual Lightning Networks total channel balances, inter-connectivity, and services/infrastructure all built on top of it. Channel balances will instantly get stolen by whatever nodes chose to be opportunistic and send old states on the new network because you don't have a network of watchtower enabled Lightning nodes. Then they'd sell those coins for whatever small price they're listed at to begin with, and the entire prop-up network will instantly become devalued in the process, worse than what we currently see which is a slow bleed with pumps along the way.
Now you can imagine that the more layers/infrastructure built on top of Lightning, or other standalone layer 2 networks, the more immutable and secure the first layer becomes. Just remember it's not about the actual number of nodes, it's about your ability to do so if you wanted to, the incentive will come with more technology/infrastructure.

Doubtful. Stop inferring things.
The absolute numbers have gone down, I brought this up myself already on Slack and Twitter.
Keep in mind these are the absolute numbers in completed blocks, not the mempool.
If non-SegWit transactions are paying more in fees, they will be included over SegWit transactions.
If people are sweeping their keys, and wallets don't calculate the fee correctly, these transactions will take priority within the block and force out SegWit transactions.
Likewise, the fee estimation algorithms in wallets are complex *(as they should be given all the dynamics at play)*, but for unknown/new complications they are unprepared for, it's very easy to throw this out of wack.
It's quite possible that wallets are incorrectly estimating fees given these new numbers and are simply squeezing SegWit transactions out of the blocks.
Have you analyzed any of the data? I haven't. But I know what's possible and just because they are absolute numbers as the other person said, doesn't imply much else than another data point to research from.

1. Hates government and control. 100% Libertarian.
2. Is overly paranoid about Bitcoin potentially failing to something else.
3. Is incapable of thinking his logic through.
4. Ultimately feels he's doing the right thing.
5. Has no qualms breaking social norms (ethics/laws) to achieve want he wants.
None of these are *"bad"* in and of themself, but combine all of this together, you get someone who is willing to lie and scam people, under their own misguided belief that "the end justifies the means".
"It's okay if I lie and scam people to increase my following and attention, so long as it draws more total awareness to the threats that pose Bitcoin and helps push the scaling I sincerely think is an issue.

The thing about coins disappearing is it reduces the "total" supply.
The total supply is only relevant in respect to how much % of the total supply you own, which only goes up the longer you hold.
Since the coins can be divisible down to an arbitrary smaller unit at any time via a fork, you have abundance in usability with the benefits of a finite supply ***cap.***
Cap is the keyword, because it's a limit on how much will ever be created ***in total.***
The actual amount is pretty regulated and lost coins benefit everyone who has coins.
Lost ca$h doesn't really benefit anyone if you lose/destroy it, the government accounts for lost/destroyed money when they release more into circulation.

If you're going to summarize my words, do it this way instead:


The total supply cap of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins.
Price goes up and down due to supply(***finite***), demand(growing), and speculation(cause of bubbles/crashes).
When we talk about inflation (any economist), we mean ***the devaluation*** of the ***unit***.
When the Zimbabwe Dollar [**hyper-inflated**]( the ***purchasing power*** of a single unit went ***down.***
The value compared to that of the USD went ***down.***
When Bitcoins price goes ***up*** compared to other currencies, this is not [**inflation**](

Remember this behavior the next time there's a new BIP and softfork in the pipeline and they try to stop it or slow it down.

That's not feasible because they could create their own transactions to fill up the empty space.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:46:56
First, if you still plan on moving your coins to split them up, I recommend at least waiting until after the 2X split, otherwise you'll find yourself moving them all again to dump coins and avoid replay protection.
Consolidate them now (unless privacy is your concern), and split them up after.
I'd potentially wait until AggSig if you really want to split them up into a bunch of different address for long term holding.


Mining centralization is a growing concern. Everyone touts that it will get better with time, and the result continues to be the opposite.
I personally think it will get better once major manufacturers get into the picture, right now Bitmain controls most of the distribution to almost everyone.
That being said, a PoW change has pros and cons to it.
I think a PoW change would level the current playing playing field and pose little to no risk on the security models of Bitcoin.
You'll find some people disagree with me on that but this is an argument for another thread.


Fee manipulation is a vulnerability, but the solution isn't really a technical one. The solution is increased decentralization. Although AggSig works to make certain types of "malicious" transactions more expensive. *(I'm done using the term spam by the way, it's too easy for trolls to create an argument out of.)*
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:43:09
What that is really saying is, some random company/government can come along and spin up 100,000 nodes of their own with completely different software and call it Bitcoin, that doesn't make it Bitcoin.
Some random company/government can come along and spin up 1,000 nodes and call it Bitcoin, but that doesn't make it Bitcoin.
Some random company/government can come along and change ***1 tiny little thing***, and spin up 500 nodes, but that doesn't make it Bitcoin.
The point here is, it's your obligation as an individual, in order to protect your funds, to run a full node so you can always look at a block and say "no, that's not right at all, goodbye, be gone"...and reject it.
This is a fundamental property of Bitcoin and it's explained in the video I linked.
Is it feasible to have everyone run a full node right now?
No, of course not, and that's a ***very*** pressing issue.
Technology just isn't there yet to allow people to run a full node on your phone for example...
And the technology isn't there yet to allow everyone to just spin up a node at home a tether their SPV wallet on their phone to their home node.
Right now they have to rely on 3rd parties like Bread...and they have to ***trust*** Bread. This is a problem.
Guess what? Bread backed off and said "we can't even do anything about this because the fork has no replay protection, you people are on your own, we suggest you don't make any transactions for a while."
This is a ***big*** problem, and I feel bad for the people who are ***going*** to lose their funds trying to transact via Bread or any other SPV wallet during/after the fork.
So how do we get to a point where as many people as possible can run a full node to avoid this?
We let technology catch up. We keep the resource requirement growth to running a node lower than technological growth.
We don't keep it ***at pace***, because then it'll never catch up, and we definitely don't grow it faster. This isn't just about hard drives.
Block verification times: If you can't ***verify*** the blocks faster than they are created because they are too big, Bitcoin is broken.
Bandwidth restrictions: If your bandwidth is capped, or simply not fast enough, you can't ***download*** blocks fast enough because they are too big, and Bitcoin is broken.

I have no expectation of that happening anytime soon either, but Lightning Network is very prospectable at the moment, and should ease anyone's concern over scaling for the near future.

If 99% of the miners were consolidated into a single location, run by a single entity, and they decided to divert hashpower to a different chain that were incompatible with all the nodes.
The tens of thousands of nodes already existing ran by all of us disagreed with the move, but Bitcoin and its name would now be in the hands of that one miner with 99% hashpower?
You need to evaluate your logic.

My understanding of survivorship bias is when, let's say, a CEO says that he was "able to achieve his goals by working hard, never quitting, and always having his eye on the target", but plenty (and most) people who have also done that very same thing did not see the same or similar results.
Basically, detailing a process or procedure, and then asserting the outcome was a result of that.
Someone like Bill Gates could say that he went to school, did X, Y, Z to further his education and interest in the field, and that's how he got where he was. Yet someone else who did similar things wouldn't have, even at the time, because Bill Gates lived near and went to a very specific school that had one of the country's first and only super computers that a child could get access to on their free time.
A plane crashes and the only survivor is asked if they feel like any of their actions resulted in their survival. Literally anything they say is going to be survivorship bias.
Like I said, I just don't think that applies here.

Comparisons to other market caps is where market cap falls apart, but when you're using it to compare it to itself, it can hold some value.

Bread uses a seed phrase that gives you a key, and then uses a deterministic path to produce more keys from that seed.
As long as you have that initial seed you'll be fine.
The issue is when it comes to bottom of the barrel forks (like Bitcoin Gold), Bread might not update their app to support extracting.
Also, importing across different wallets with your Bread seed isn't the easiest thing to do, because of this: 
Other clients might not support the deterministic format Bread uses, which normally isn't an issue if you just want to send to another client.
In this case you want to retrieve Bitcoin Gold / another shitcoin.

The users response to that was a [**very centralized graph**]( with multiple [**critically important nodes**]( that would require the network to function, and if they ceased to exist would [**split the network up into 2 or more fragments.**](
That network graph was then rearranged in a [**manner like mine**]( in order to give the impression that the LN the same type of centralized properties as their network example.
We are in agreement in this respect: Just because a graph is rearranged doesn't make it's properties change, just which one's are highlighted/suppressed.
As before, that users graph still has the same properties...[**take away Node  and the network splits into three networks, and isolates three nodes completely.
This is ***impossible*** with the Lightning Network as it stands *(only a few weeks old)*, and I demonstrate that in both the original, and the follow up. 


The 2nd one is annotated so this point isn't missed when the image is passed around, not as a direct reply to that user, I already replied to that user in their own thread.
If I had a tool that would arrange all of the nodes into a circle by order of the amount of channels they have I would use that instead of doing this by hand.
The website itself could be better. There's color bias, and the way the physics are coded to arrange the nodes leaves some well connected nodes standing out, while many go hidden.
This results in people *(as you pointed out)* looking at a visual, and responding like [**this.**]( It goes both ways, and you can still locate that pink one just as easily on mine anyway.
This was never a discussion until someone fudged a fake network example to make the LN appear to be much more node dependent on a single node than it ever will be, and I don't need to formulate an argument any further than what I already have.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:33:51
This [**video**]( is an excellent introductory to mining, and it answers your question in the simple form.
I recommend watching it, but to elaborate:
Part of the consensus protocol code that all nodes run is to "follow the longest *valid* chain".
If a longer *valid* chain is found by your node, it will "reorg"anize to the longer chain, and drop the old one. How long your node waits to drop the shorter chain I can't recall.
Length isn't measured by number of blocks though, it's measured by the sum of the *difficulty* of all the blocks.
Keep in mind, this only applies to nodes following the same consensus rules.
Hardforks *(consensus breaking protocol changes)* **supersede** reorganization protocol, and nodes that don't upgrade get cut off, because what defines valid is changed in a non-backwards compatible way.
Softforks **leverage** reorganization protocol, and don't get cut off when new upgrades are applied because old nodes continue to consider the new blocks they receive valid.
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:37:29

Bitcoin's security, really simply put, relies on hashes being really easy to generate, but really hard to generate the right one.
Quantum computing makes it much easier to generate the right one, but the solution is to use a "quantum safe" method.
Quantum safe hashes are much longer, take up more space on the blockchain, require more work to validate, etc...
It's extra load on the network in general, all of which would not be good to dump onto Bitcoin right now.
When the time comes where we need to switch, it won't be an issue the way it would be right now while Bitcoin is in it's infancy.

Which encourages companies to produce better and more convincing products instead of garbage that's ***designed to fail*** with time.
To add to this, many people overestimate the effects of deflation within the context of Bitcoin being mass adopted.
The average person wouldn't even be gaining as much as 5% on $1,000 in this scenario, which is currently much more than what we lose on $1,000 right now by holding dollars.
The average person isn't going to "not spend" their $1,000 they have saved up and not buy something (like an iPhone) just because in ~1 year, they'll have an extra $50 in a years time.
I wouldn't...and I'm holding BTC for a looooooong time.
But once were at mass adoption and my checks every week are coming in as BTC, I'm not going to just not spend any of my money just because of whatever small % gain I'm getting per year.
It's a severely overestimated reaction to the term deflationary.
The average consumer in America person doesn't even have much saved at all to begin with, yet they still go out on buy this or that and run themselves into debt.
Deflation won't change anything besides marginally enticing companies to produce better products.

If you have a channel open, [**it's with their node.**](

@_date: 2018-04-30 01:55:33
The topology is known to every full node because channels are just multisignature addresses.
You would have to pick them poorly, and they should be selected "randomly" the way full nodes find peers.
They can only cheat you for however much you have in a channel with each one of them, and the risk they have is losing all of that money, and it all goes to you because the system is designed to reward the victim if cheating is attempted.
Your node would have to be offline for a long period of time AND these Watchtowers would have to collude AND they would be risking however much money they have channeled with you. If every, or even most nodes are Watchtowers it's more than extremely unlikely an *attempt* would even happen.

Your original statement began with miners and "maybe" very large merchants. Not even "very large merchants", you said "maybe".

As such, **I** run code written by a group of developers that have similar desires as **mine**.
*The issue* is there's enough of us, including many competent developers, that want that the same thing as **me**, making us a large non-uniform **we**. This makes some other people upset because there's nothing they can do about it, because there isn't enough of them or competent developers that are working in the opposite direction. *They* want **X**, but *more* people want **Y**, and *most* people *(everyone else)* just don't care about our little "game" we're playing.

Well, that's basically the size of the blockchain, and as such the bandwidth is the primary bottleneck for full-nodes as it is anyway.

My understanding is that *Overt* AsicBoost still provides larger miners a disproportional advantage.
I was also under the impression that a SegWit Hard Fork had the potential to keep Covert AsicBoost usable.
I could be wrong with either of those.
Also, the term "compromise" makes this whole thing very muddy.
Does a compromise imply a new release of code that *includes* SegWit, or is a compromise just activating SegWit and everyone agreeing to what they all pretty much agree to...We'll start talking about a blocksize increase.
If it's a new release, and I'm correct on Overt AsicBoost, I'd imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to disable it in that same release should they "demand" a Hard Fork of SegWit.
Basically, it needs to be made very clear to them that SegWit is activating and AsicBoost is going away under any and all circumstances.
Leave zero room to move goalposts. If what they want is 2MB, let them prove that's ***all*** they want.

Using the tools available to you to do what you want is as free as freedom gets.
The issue is when those freedoms impinge on others.
Impinge is a big grey area because you have "fools" who "deserve" to get rekt (arguably), because they "made their own choice"...and yet we have a bunch of dead babies we have a moral obligation to protect from infant mortality?
Which one is it?
If you have any morals you'd like to assign to the word "Libertarian", you may want to take a look at Roger's morality and consider the [**concept of desert**]( and social recourse/response. Some call an aspect of that "social justice", but that's been politicized to mean the left/liberal movement in today's society, and not the underlying concept, which is [**apolitical**](
I'm of the philosophy that, *generally*, actions have predictable consequences and it's your responsibility as a free individual to accept the potentiality of those consequences, even if you don't believe those consequences should exist.
I ***should*** be able to carry around a black water gun without consequence, but I'm an idiot if I think there ***will*** be no consequences for pointing it at a cop.
It's of my opinion through observation of his consistent and clear behavior that he is incapable of this kind of thought process. He knew what he was doing when he started this, and ***should*** have known the potential consequences and accepted that as a risk. This is his desert. Some call it karma.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:15:56
It's a stepping stone towards it though.
What's the upper limit?
Who determines that upper limit and then what?
The scaling debate moves towards increasing that upper limit? It's effectively the same thing as where we are at now.
These numbers need to be defined.
Are we talking about a median blocksize of 4MB with an upper limit of 8MB? 
Or are we talking about an upper limit of something like 32/64/256MB?
Or are we talking about a +- range of 2MB no matter the current block size?
2 years from now, 4MB +- 2MB range?
4 years from now 8MB +- 2MB range? or 8MB range?
These are important because those goal posts get moved very easily once you start to agree about "talking" about it.
I genuinely think it's easier to keep a hard limit in place with any dynamic solutions.
We ***will*** have 2nd layer solutions that will innevitably be indiscernable from the current Bitcoin protocol.
We should be waiting to see how they grow together before we start hard coding more dynamic systems into the protocol.
I'm open to responses.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:40:43
I'm not shooting down the idea, I'm shooting down the wording of the agreement and the way it's supposedly implemented.
It's completely incompatible with the current version of SegWit, and must wait for the "old" SegWit to timeout before it can even go into effect.
Have you looked at any of the [**developer comments**]( on the code?










I can keep going, but it's all right there. This code is botched and delays the whole process.
It would be much easier to take the current SegWit and just add code into it that makes a 2MB hardfork activate by a specific date after SegWits activation.
They're changing it ***for no reason.*** Which really means, ***they have a reason but they aren't telling us.***
I'm not against a 2MB hardfork.
Fuck, I'd be okay with SegWit+2MB ***right now*** at this point.
***This code doesn't do that.***

You could potentially run if from your phone, but I don't see a mobile mesh-network of Lightning  full nodes routing payments around for other people happening any time soon.
Yes, most mobile devices are always on, and in the future it *might* be possible to store and run a full node on your phone, but we are really far off from that potential, even with the current block size restrictions. You can completely forget about it if we increase it.

To be honest I suspected the possibility that this was all to spark an attack on crypto-currencies but that's something we will never know.
The malware was edited to not generate new addresses but have all payments sent to 1 of 3 addresses with no way to verify who payed what, and no way to decrypt the drives.
Without multiple mixing services over a long period of time, these coins won't be that usable. Not an issue if the reward of the coins wasn't the end goal...
Still no way to know so the only thing we can do is treat the issue for what it is and handle bad publicity as it comes in.
But to address the "without computers" statement, most people have access to another computer or smartphone, and the 3 addresses are being tracked by everyone anyway so we know what the balances are. People have payed.

***They*** are trying to stall it by creating their own version.
This version most likely:
1. Doesn't disable AsicBoost
2. Activates a 2MB hardfork first
3. Requires 80% miner consent for SegWit which means Jihan/Antpool will never signal so we won't get SegWit and they'll just take the 2MB blocks.
We will probably never see SegWit under this implementation.

Here's the thing...
The issue is not block size, it's ***transaction throughput*** and high fees as a result.
Miners ***want*** high fees so they can collect them and make more in profits.
More transaction throughput means more usability. Lower fees means better usability. Both are good for Bitcoin.
There are many ways to increase transaction throughput just like there are many ways to increase the speed of a car. Adding a bigger engine isn't always the best solution. Then some people say it's not just about speed it's about sustainability, longevity of a car is important, gas mileage, etc...
Thing is, the entire community almost unanimously agrees we need more throughput, and most of the technically competent people agree SegWit is the best approach.
"The other side" says we should just increase the block size and they have a lot of money to back them up (Roger Ver).
The major miners (like Jihan Wu and his company Bitmain) back that side because it allows them to block ***any*** throughput increase without actually saying "we like high fees because we make a lot of money this way."
Also, SegWit just so happens to block a major exploit in mining that allows large miners to profit unfairly, another reason they don't want it.
SegWit paves the way for many other useful features like the [**Lightning**]( Network, [**Schnor**]( signatures, and [**MAST.**](
All of which provide very good solutions to the scalability situation ***as well as*** a bunch of other features that improve the protocol in general. Read up on them if you're interested but I would suggest slowly stepping into the community and not nosediving into all the technical aspects just yet. Get a grasp on the fundamentals first, and goodluck!

I'm about to butcher this trying to keep it simple but...
No, the channel is opened via a multi signature between both parties. The channel has a lock time and if the channel passes that lock time the money stays where it was the whole time...in your respective wallets.
The only thing a channel really does is allow you to adjust that multisignature with micro payments and send it to the other party for approval, if they approve then they adjust that signature for approval and send it back so you're in sync. 
If they don't adjust it for approval your money isn't lost, it just never goes to them. All the while, all of your money still belongs to you until the channel closes anyway. You're signature from your keys are always required for every payment you make.
You're basically creating a transaction the same way you would normally, but instead of sending it to the blockchain, you're sending it to them directly.
Then 6 hours later, you send them an updated version of that transaction. Then 3 hours later you send another small payment that updates the old transaction.
All the while, they can't actually collect any of this unless the final transaction gets posted to the blockchain, AND, it has to be posted before the lock time runs out or you get all your money back.
So they have not just an incentive, but a prime motive to get that transaction posted, and you control when it has to be posted by.
Except, if i'm not mistaken, lightning network is being designed to route and work much like the Tor network, in the sense that the channels have multiple hops to get to where it has to go, but everyone in between that's it's using to hop can't mess with the signature, they simply hand it off to the next guy.
It's hard to imagine right off the bat setting all this up as an average user but realistically, the surface interaction will become so refined over time that creating a channel with a store you go to frequently will be as easy as a swipe of a finger.
A lot of work still needs to get done to get to this point but the fundamental code behind it works.
Routing needs to be solve for large scales, and the entire lightning platform needs a body kit, right now it's barebones, just the frame.

I think Watchtower functionality should be built into the client and on by default.
My node has channels with 8 other nodes. My node watches the channels of all 8 of those nodes.
So every node is a Watchtower for all nodes connected by a degree of 1, or a Watchtower for all 2nd degree channels, to put it another way.
This ensures that you have at least X amount of Watchtowers keeping track at all times, so when one disconnects, you still have X-1. This scales nicely because the likelihood of 8 disconnecting all at the same time is something...unlikely.
It also dismisses any claims of "3rd party outsourcing", because it's just part of the protocol.

Any code they put in place to decrypt your drive opens up a window for a full recovery because it implies the decryption method is stored locally.
They don't want a fix for their malware, they want money.
If it's not stored locally then it's stored remotely, which is a detection risk.

Upgrade numero uno: Change SegWits ***activation threshold from 95% to 80%*** and ***change the bit it signals on.***

***Nothing about forcing SegWit.*** Nothing, nada, it's not there. The people who signed this signed this ***knowing that.***
So Jihan Wu and his large hashrate, he signed this knowing he's not agreeing to a mandatory SegWit, ***he's agreeing to the threshold change knowing he will never signal so it will never reach 80%.***

Automation is happening whether you like it or not. Whether it's 25 years from now or 1000 years from now.
Suggest an economy that functions around machines doing everything for us while still allowing individuals with all their new free time to continue to be individuals (ie: humans) ?
How we transition to this economy is *(and is almost widely accepted among most established futurists)* a universal basic income.
Can we make that term simpler? Yeah, ***machines do everything***, we all get free handouts.
Free. Handouts.
Yeah, it's harsh, it sounds bad and it's ugly, right?
Well, that's the reality, or we all die and humans are a notch in the belt of evolution and machine AI takes over, and they don't need to grow apples or care about the environment like we do to survive.
How do we start off this "free handout" economy? We start giving free handouts to select groups, then slowly expand those groups and who's allowed to be in them.

To add to this:


This is probably the most important aspect to this whole situation.
I'm for SegWit &amp; the UASF activation of it, but some things that are important to understand:
1. Miners ***do*** stand to lose profits (fee collections) whether we activate SegWit, or any other form of block-size increase. They have an incentive to block the activation as long as they can to collect the most fees. Ultimately, under ***any*** chain split, they will mine the most ***valuable*** chain, which is determined by the economic support (the users) behind that chain.
2. SegWit allows 2nd layer networks like the Lightning Network to be built on top of it, but eventually (ideally IMO) this will be indiscernible from the actual Bitcoin protocol, much like the entire [**Internet Protocol.**]( This opens the *"fee market"* to a much broader audience, allowing people who can run full nodes to enter the fee market and further decentralizing the network as a whole. This takes away from miners profits (in the short term) and incentivizes miners to block SegWit so Lightning Network doesn't get implemented.
This UASF is the user base starting to wake up and calling the miners bluff.
When we split, most people will value the SegWit chain and very little will value the non SegWit chain.
If you're a miner, would you mine a coin worth $100 or a coin worth $2000?
Or...just read [**the link**]( sent.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:32:40
**Edit:** I'm pro SegWit and pro-UASF, but because I use terms like "segwit chain" and say "buttcoin" as a joke people downvote.
I just made a copy of the entire Bitcoin blockchain and I'm renaming is ButtCoin.
If you send me a transaction using your cold storage key I'll mine it in the next block and it will go wherever you want it to go...on the ButtCoin blockchain.
Your coins on the SegWit chain will stay put and still be usable with that same key so no worries!
Paper wallets are safe.

A node is another term for a server.
*Nodes, hosts, servers...*all ***relatively*** interchangeable but their usages vary within context.
The *"servers"* connect through the internet and create what is considered the Bitcoin network.
If you run a node you're contributing to the network.
If you send a transaction, it gets sent to the nodes, which pass the transactions around to all the other nodes and validate the blocks that are mined by miners.
You don't need to run a node to mine. Miners do nothing to relay or validate transactions.
You can run a node without doing anything crazy by downloading the Bitcoin client and running it on your computer in the background. (If you wanted to.)
This is why the term server isn't the best use-case here because we don't really consider a client running in the background of a Windows machine you use to browse Facebook with all day a *"server"*.

There's no way for the virus on your computer to verify you sent a payment.
It doesn't generate a unique address for anyone, it generates 1 of 3 very known addresses that everyone is being tricked into paying.
Typical ransomware gives unique keys generated from a server most likely hosted over the Tor network, which it then connects to to verify you payed that unique address, but WannaCry doesn't do any of that.

Much of the Segwit2X support was from the companies pushing it along with closet BCash supporters.
There were some in the middle who were "fed up with the debate" and thought 2X was a decent compromise, but that faded with time, and then 2X just showed it's limited cards once it was listed on the futures markets exchanges set up.
I would go and say that it's very possible many claimed "okay" with Segwit2X knowing the conditions would result in Segwit and then no 2X split later down the timeline.

They have a switch that processes all of the trades they get day to day.
The the coins in their possession move from address to address depending on ***their*** needs, but there is no private key that is unique to you.
When you want to send coins to an address of your choosing, they then process that and send your requested amount from one of their many keys to the one you want it to go to.
Let's say you want to send 3 BTC to someone, and someone else makes a request at the same time to send 7 BTC to someone else.
If Coinbase has a nice laundry lists of addresses, there's a possibility that one may total to 10 BTC and Coinbase will send 3 to your requested address and 7 to the other persons requested address.
These calculations happen constantly on their end to determine how they should divvy up the requests, I'd presume to minimize the amount of [**dust**]( they create and optimize their profit in many ways.
I'm sure they also save all of their dust keys so in the future as the price moves up these dust wallets become economically spendable again.

I don't agree, but this really comes down to our definition and quantitative value of "demand".
They've already announced their intent to start supporting more coins this year (their words), but they won't be another Poloniex (my words).
Every addition they've included in their lineup has been the next logical step and the only other coin I see them adopting relatively soon is Monero.
I'm not a fanboy, I just don't see them taking on something like Dash...ever.
They don't seem to be the type of company that ever wants to have to discontinue support for a coin (with the exceptions of fork splits).
Expect them to really asses the response adding Litecoin to their platform gets, how it effects daily user volume, new user volume, trading volume, etc...We'll see their next addition towards the end of the year.

It's very easy to hardcode it into the SegWit activation...
A BIP has already been proposed that implements both SegWit ***in it's current state*** and a forced 2MB hardfork.
This one nobody can back out of, the original one SegWit can easily just not be signaled for by Jihan/Antpool and it'll never happen.
Enough with the core/blockstream conspiracy.
SegWit is getting activated. The compromise is on them, not us. We will activate it with or without you.

If you don't think Bitcoin will continue to scale it's userbase you can move along to another altcoin.
Your argument is invalid because it ignores the entire point of scaling.

2. After some point in the future **A** can't continue to happen unless **B** happens.

Not necessarily, there's definitely a "good enough" threshold you can reach.
If you add in CT's now, you have to keep them when you "upgrade" them later, else you're hardforking.
Anything in between "just for now" is technical debt, and an appeal to high time preference minded people. No one needs CT's enough right now to justify opensource devs going out of their way to code something they know will be replaced.

They forgot the part where SegWit activation needs to be mandatory or else ***this is not a compromise at all.***
Who's writing the code for the 2MB hardfork if SegWit never activates?
Who's vetting that code?
Why not draw up a 6 month timeline where SegWit + 2MB ***both occur*** on a certain date?

Every time it plummets it floors at a higher level than the last, this includes the GOX bubble.
You can plot this and see a very clear growth curve in adoption.
The price artificially rises above this curve because of speculation and day traders. When those guys bail out to take this months winnings, the final floor price is arguably a direct representation of that adoption/price correlation.
You can see this even easier in the most recent logarithmic charts.
All of this can also be argued against, but that doesn't make you ***or*** me right.

@_date: 2017-05-30 14:40:51
So here's a different way of looking at this system.
The Bitcoin network is run by a bunch of nodes that sync up the entire blockchain.
The miners connect to this network and "pull" information from it. The information they pull is simply put, a list of all the current pending transactions being spread between all the nodes.
The miners take those transactions and try to create "valid" blocks, this process of "trying" is called mining.
Once a valid block is created it is sent back to the nodes to be accepted into the blockchain. ***The nodes validate those blocks, and all sync up together.***
The Lightning Network doesn't take anything ***off*** of Bitcoin, it ***adds*** to Bitcoin.
With LN, nodes now have a secondary way of communicating with each other, through LN channels. These channels are digitally signed using your keys in a way that benefits ***you*** as a user. Channels can't be closed without posting them on the blockchain or the nodes don't get to collect the fees or the payment you sent, ***you get everything back.***
Notice the fee collection aspect. It's relatively very small compared to mining but the requirements to do so are also small. This lowers the barrier for entry into the fee market, which is currently dominated by a small subset of miners.
On top of this, you can set a deadline for ***when*** a channel must be closed, ***or else you get everything back.***
The whole system is designed to force all communication on the Lightning Network to be fully tied to the blockchain because everyone involved that isn't the sender can't collect their portion without the transaction being posted into a block.
Lightning Network is not a sidechain, or a separate network. 5-10 years from now it will be indiscernible from the protocol as a whole.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:47:48
I don't know these answers.
My point is, without easy access to Bitcoin, the price would never rise.
If the guy who bought the pizza for 10k BTC never bought but held his coins instead, you could also say he would've made more by just holding.
If everyone held their coins and never tried to purchase anything in the early days there would be no price, you ***need*** sellers and buyers.
You need an active economy, that of which you can't have without Bitcoin companies (*"startups"*), and in every environment you will have successes and failures.

What about the central authority that legally grants Roger his ownership status of the website?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:46:43
The protocol has a built in system designed to control the creation of blocks to an average of 1 block every 10 minutes.
This 10 minute period of block creation doesn't get faster, but the amount of throughput speeds up because the blocks can hold more data in each of them.
Increasing the size of these blocks is a ***tradeoff*** and needs to be done with caution.
SegWit works a little bit of magic and also has a net increase of just under double the current block size.
This would completely eliminate the current mempool fiasco for the near future and allow the discussion to move away from the fee increase (for now) and towards better scaling solutions.
The magic that SegWit also does, aside from increasing the block size, is it allows things like the Lightning Network to function on top of it, which would increase transaction throughput in ways that even a 100mb increase in blocksize can't do.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:12:40
It only says shortly after lock-in. Doesn't say it will lock in, doesn't say it disables AsicBoost, and doesn't say the 2MB requires SegWit lock-in.
It's simple really, reword that whole proposal to clear up any confusion and then see what the community has to say. 
Say this clearly and then we're talking about a decent compromise: **2MB IF AND ONLY IF SEGWIT IS LOCKED IN.**

No it doesn't because increasing the block size has compounding effects the more you continue to increase the block size. 
Again, this isn't about 2MB, this is about stopping the trend of continuously doubling the block-size without considering it's other effects on the system.
This is about not ignoring alternative scaling solutions that will be necessary regardless, for the sake of satisfying some short sighted fundamentalists who don't understand ***precedent***.

Practically, your key (when it's in it's "storage" phase) should never be stored in it's raw format.
Take a HEX string, add a pass-code to the beginning, or the end, or both, or 5 (or 6 or 7) spaces into the key, then [run that string through SHA256.](
So: (password+oldHEX) --&gt; SHA256 --&gt; newHEX 
Right down, or digitally store the oldHEX, and remember the password and its placement. The newHEX is your real private key.
Any leak of the oldHEX would just completely throw off any brute force algorithms.
You could even do multiple factors of this.
Password plus SHA256, then add another password then SHA256 again.
Split the key in half and swap every other or every 3rd character with a different character, you could even swap every 4th out with all 0's and then SHA256 it.
There are ***a lot*** of options that are weak in their singular form but all you have to do is pick any 3 simple ones and an order in which you use them and you could effectively share that oldHEX with whoever you want and they aren't touching your coins.
The self encryption options you have are much more entropic than you'd think, ***but susceptible to socio-engineering.***

It has nothing to do with learning about how it's done.
You can study how the entire Bitcoin protocol works for years, you're still not going to be able to mine Bitcoins because of other factors.
If you want to learn ***how*** it works, there are many resources available.
If you want to know why ***you*** can't, it comes down to a couple of things:
1. The hardware required to mine Bitcoins is much higher than your budget.
2. Buying that hardware and running it will result in a net loss of money. You will be paying electricity through the roof and will have little to zero returns when it comes to Bitcoin rewards.
3. You probably don't have free electricity. ***If you do, it won't be free for long,*** someone will notice the usage and do something about it.
4. By the time you come ***anywhere*** close to breaking even there will be much better hardware available, and for much more money. (Which you wouldn't be able to afford because you haven't made any profits yet.) This will increase the global hashrate and lower your "profits" in return. (You'll never see any profits.)
5. All the money you invested, and all the money you spent in electricity could have just went to ***buying Bitcoin and holding onto it as the price goes up.***
The people who mine Bitcoin now have mining [***farms,***]( in very very cheap electricity locations.

Nobody is spreading the correct information and the media has no fucking clue what they're talking about.

The virus doesn't ask you to sign from the sending address so there's no way you can prove you are the sender.
It works because people are uninformed* and lack the scope of knowledge required to understand what really just happened to them.
Do you think the virus is asking you for the sending address? What if someone randomly made a Coinbase account?
What if someone is monitoring the reciving address for new payments and claims that txID before you do?

Bitcoin is not a stock, so it grows with user adoption. The price reflects that growth, ***for the most part.***
Every now and then it gets over valued by investors looking to make quick money and hype is created around that over valuation. Or, exchanges play funny games and cause prices to move up.
This creates bubbles in the price, which inevitably crash when the short term investors and loose hands cash out, or when exchanges play funny games for too long.
When the price inevitably crashes, it returns to the level it would have wound up at if there was never any bubble.
Logarithmic charts are perfect for for showing this, as you can clearly see the steady increase upwards, as well as where the bubbles form and how they really are insignificant in the long run.

I'm sure this was meant to imply "at the current time".


While Bitcoin could be ***useful*** to people in third world countries, so could cell phones in the 70's, but nobody was shouting they ***need*** it.
It will definitely scale outward but adoption always starts higher up on the ladder until the technology becomes cheaper.
Elon Musk based his entire Tesla line on that concept by selling a sports car first and slowly rolling out cheaper models over time.
In the 70's nobody in the third world had any "*real*" use case for a mobile phone the size of their head.
Nobody was saying "We need people in African villages to have access to these phones now!"
That being said, I'm sure we had ***some*** visionaries who thought ahead saying those things and they were shut down or laughed at as well.
Visionary's tend to have an optimistic time scale of the future while most people can't even imagine a future from the movies realistically happening in their lifetime.

This depends on where you plan on holding your Bitcoins.
I don't recommend putting them on an exchange.
Coinbase has been having capacity issues recently but their coins are more secure than Poloniex.
The fee on Coinbase isn't too high, the price varies.
Coinbase's price is high right now because of the huge influx of new people joining the game all buying from Coinbase.
A month ago Poloniex had a $100 lead because of the alt bubbles the people in the trollbox pushed. (You can't buy most alts directly with cash so you need to first purchase BTC.)

The term "destroy governments" is a playful / rebellious one.

Eventually governments will slowly lose their ability to manipulate the money supply to do what they want while your wealth gets stolen from you despite the balance in your wallet remaining the same.

I actually agree.


If SegWit was blocked and no one ever argued for it or called the miners out on what they were doing, we wouldn't have SegWit2x right now.
We wouldn't have a push for BIP148, nor would we have BIP149 either.
Calling them out brings awareness to the community the same way Wikileaks brings awareness to the people.
Public knowledge is a very important factor when it comes to actions from those in power or trying to get power.
Wikileaks arguably changed the election results last year. ***I'm not taking sides with that,*** it's just a fact of the matter.
Same applies here.
The rhetoric used to be, Antpool is mining empty blocks. I'm adding to that rhetoric by including more information, showing what other pools are doing it, and how they are gaming the fee market in the process.
I'm doing it for ***awareness***. There's many people here who are relatively new, or don't understand all the details, the more informed the community is, the better. IMO.

It's not about the increase from 1MB to 2MB.
It's about the idea that continuing that trend will somehow work as things scale exponentially. Other bottlenecks will quickly prop up.
Second layers are happening whether the block size ever increases or not. Let's see how those second layers do first.
SegWit provides more transaction throughout anyway so it's an effective increase and you know that, while opening the door for second layers.

When you look at how ***this specific*** ransomware simple handles the ransom (only 3 addresses, "verify" button does nothing but say "we haven't received payment yet"), you can see there's [**no proof of payment verification in place.**](
All the other ransomwares give unique new addresses to pay to that they check to verify, this one doesn't.
They expected and planned all of this. Zero overhead, massive spread, "affordable" bait payments.

This is the thing.
It really needs to be stressed that ***miners are contractors*** in this system.
Their incentive is to get paid, ***as it should be.***
They shouldn't be expected to care about anything else, so they shouldn't even be hated for it.
You don't get mad at a wolf for eating a sheep, ***that's what it does.***
The employers (all users) responsibility is to set the terms and agreements so the company benefits from the contractors work, while still providing enough incentive so that there will always be plenty of people willing to work under that contract to get the job done.
Most of the time the argument is over the "minimum wage" issue in fear that we will lose miners if their incentives to work are too low.
I think it's a misguided fear.
TL;DR: Activate SegWit on your own, stop waiting for the wolves to say "Okay, we're not going to eat the sheep anymore."

SegWit adds transaction throughput, and Schnorr (which requires SegWit) eliminates the need to consolidate inputs. The mempool is empty, when it gets near to zero the [**"big guys" take all their dust wallets and dump them together**]( for their cheap 1 sat/byte fees. *(Unnecessary with Schnorr)*
The only difference between the mempool now and last year is the fee ***spread*** is more distributed. You had 50 people sending sub-10 sat/byte fees and 40 people sending 10-20, and 10 sending 30-40.
The price moved, bigger players came on board who are willing to pay a premium, along with a bunch of misinformed people who just don't realize, don't care.
Now it's 10-10, 10-20, 10-30, 10-40, 10-50, 10-60, 10-70, etc....but the ***volume*** is negligibly different, with the exception of malicious spam txs a few months back that we've since recovered from.
The wake of that is the new fee ***distribution***, which was inevitable anyway no matter what the situation.
Once SegWit gets activated fees are going to drop pretty fucking fast...***unless the network gets "spammed" again,*** by either malicious actors (real spam), or opportunists looking to store data permanently on the blockchain, or just "micro-dust" consolidation for zero fees *(again, eliminated with Schnorr signatures)*.
No matter the block size, ***somebody*** will take advantage of 0 Satoshi/byte fees.
Increasing the block size is a ***last resort.*** It's a kick the can down the road option.
We have better options and we are implementing them, so go on, keep spouting your bullshit, you'll be moving the goal posts soon enough, and we all know where that goal post moving leads, so you can forget it.
Letting the protocol dynamically control the block size has the ***clear*** adverse effect of letting actors manipulate the entire system for profit.
Some things can ***not*** be dynamically changed via signaling, whether it be by miners ***or nodes.*** This isn't a bias against miners.
Bitcoin's primary feature is ***immutability,*** and it will remain that way.
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:15:08
I get fee markets but I don't agree with this logic.
Yes, they are trying to keep their profits high by keeping the fees up, but the rest of what you said has nothing to do with that.
It's not a matter of "back of the queue", the train can fit 1000 "people". These miners aren't including anyone at all who are paying what they deem is "too little" for their train ride, so only 200 "people" are getting on their train. The rest of the seats are empty and the line at the train station is building up.
It forces other people to pay up if they want to ride, and it completely goes against the "we need bigger blocks now narrative" they are ***appearing*** to push.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:06:40

I hope you realize Bitcoin's price is determined by supply and demand.
If there are more sellers than buyers at any given time, the price will drop because there is a demand to sell.
It's simple economics and it's not unique to Bitcoin at all.
The fact that Bitcoin can be divided into pieces is also completely unrelated.
Gold can be divided into pieces but the price still moves up and down based on supply and demand.
The reason Bitcoin's price moves up over time is because over time the demand to buy goes up as user adoption increases.
There is always a push to sell also because some people are satisfied with their "short"-term gains. Which is why we have ups and downs.

Well we have to consider a few things first.
If you want to go the electronic route, there are a lot of options to secure your key, but they all require ***some*** form of encryption, like a password locked file. (Which can be lost, deleted, corrupted.)
Even with a password though, you're still encrypting it using some sort of algorithm, it's just not hands on.
SHA256 is the backbone of mining Bitcoin, if SHA256 is breakable then Bitcoin is breakable, but it's not.
Applying your own password and then SHA256-ing it is a more hands on approach than .rar-ing a wallet.dat file with a password.
Let's say your password is "hello".
You can put *hello* in the beginning, end, or in between anywhere in that HEX string.
and so on...
This one word, on top of it's own entropy, now has an effective base64 value.
I definitely don't recommend this method for everyone, but if one comes to grasp these fundamentals and they're confident in their ability to remember 3 steps, they would have a very secure key they could announce to the world and no one would be able to use it. (Barring social engineering.)

Miners are not supporting SegWit because it blocks AsicBoost.
They are supporting the shit proposal of SegWit2MB ***that doesn't actually mandate SegWit in the code.*** It mandates a 2MB hardfork and the miners will never signal for SegWit.
Show me an agreement that blocks AsicBoost and mandates SegWit before the 2MB hardfork and I'll be ok.

Not once did I mention LN.
My analogy applies to all possible non-linear scaling solutions.
The takeaway here is linear block size scaling is not feasible in and of itself. 
Currently we have multiple non-linear solutions we can implement, one upgrade which is basically crucial to almost all of those solutions, making it more immediately necessary than a kick the can down the road linear solution, is called SegWit.
We need that done first, the rest can be discussed afterwords.
Arguing for a block size increase is a distraction, not a bad thing in and of itself. So it's counter productive to the long term to take the "block size increase is more immediately" necessary stance.
When everyone has an always-on, internet connected server with a 1 gigabit up/down ***in their pocket***, it would be foolish not to increase the block size, but we aren't there yet.
When I say ***everyone***, I mean a majority of third world people.

Correct but let's clarify for the other readers here that, this would only further decentralize the fee collection.
Currently only miners are incentivized to contribute to the network yet nodes do all of the transaction validation. It's a check and balance system but the checkers get nothing in return.
LN just takes the current communication between nodes and upgrades them.
With this ability, the network can support a significant amount of more transactions and will in turn raise fees for the miners over the long term.
Blocking this only rewards miners in the short term.
Realistically, when you consider "the internet of things", miners lifespans aren't going to last too long so the current miners in the game might as well block this upgrade as long as they can so they can reap the short term profits since they most likely won't be gaining much in the long term as mining becomes more and more decentralized and accessible to the average person.
Blocking it is a no brainer from that perspective but it's a losing battle, yet at the same time, a battle that they still profit more from if they fight to the death as opposed to just giving up right now.

The issue I have with this is not the merit of the proposal ***on the surface.*** It's legitimate and deserves discussion.
It's the motives of the actors behind the proposal, piggybacking the merit for their own gain.
Personally, I want SegWit for Schnorr primarily, and I'm very optimistic about LN, but I don't think it's the end-all-be-all of scaling solutions.
The argument ***against*** SegWit was political. Submission to SegWit coupled with a blocksize increase is political. This is a power-play, and I'll admit I, along with you and everyone else on all sides, are taking part in that power-play, even if we are doing so indirectly or unintentionally.
My goal is more to provide awareness to that fact and that certain key actors are benefiting when comments like the OP are made, despite the merits of those statements being legitimate.

Future scale needs to be considered here.
Monero is very small:






When we talk about protocol changes, they absolutely need to factor in future scale, and with Bitcoin, that means mass global adoption.
When ***governments &amp; corporations*** are mining to maintain a stake/vote/accountability in the ledger the protocol ***needs*** to be sound.
Dynamic block sizes by vote can make it so blocks can instantly become too small and all settling fees *(because we must assume multiple layers, Lightning Network or something else)* will instantly skyrocket. 
They can also open up the flood gates and instantly clear any backlogs in the mempool, crippling smaller entities profiting from collecting fees, making them drop out.
Imagine the USA doing this by influencing their dominance on mining hash just to play around with or threaten a smaller country by making them scared their economy will collapse.
That is ***exactly*** what Bitcoin was created to avoid.
It's crazy and borderline absurd to consider this for a layman who never even heard of or barely knows what Bitcoin is, and it's even crazy to explain how the US government ***does this right now*** to the average person.
Forget Bitcoin, good luck even trying to tell them the money in their pocket loses value because when the USA needs it they just print more and steal the value from the money in your pocket.
This is what's important.
The only dynamic protocol implementations, to the best of my understanding, that should ever be implemented, are those that can't be effected by "voting", and the only dynamic variable in the protocol is the difficulty calculations used to ensure an average block time of 10 minutes.
If you want to create a 2-way pegged sidechain that has &lt;insert dynamic feature&gt;, please be my guest. I'm okay with and open to discussion on that, but not at the base layer.
Ideally I'd like to see some sort of pegged drivechain implemented, tied to the base layer, with further protocol changes/sidechains tied to that drivechain.

There's a lot more to this that hasn't been discussed in the responses to you, and if you aren't a concern troll I employ you to stick around and keep reading up. 
It's an amazing technology and there's a lot being worked on to address all the issues Bitcoin has with scaling.
Transaction throughput has many alternative workarounds including Schnorr signatures, Lightning Network, drivechains, sidechains, etc.
You can't just keep adding a larger engine to a car to make it faster, bottlenecks prop up in different locations.
Also, there won't be an end to the block reward until 2140, and fees will compensate generously for the lack of reward well before then.
The most important thing for Bitcoin is maintaining decentralization and immutability, not expediting it's scaling abilities in ways that sacrifice those features. We have time to do it correctly and we just made a major step in the right direction.

I agree there is a difference, and maybe I was taking the OP's question as more than just an inquisition.
The reason I made any mention was because the implication here is, law enforcement hypothetically shuts down something deemed bad so the mentality is: *"good I'm glad we stopped them, how can we prevent this in the future?"*
That's how you get overreaching regulations that are meant to prevent ***X***, but in turn, prevent ***W, X, Y, Z.***

Game theory.
One side ***will*** win, and it's SegWit, but SegWit means less fees so we (miners, the large kind) will lose profits.
Take the opposing sides (BU/EC) stance and claim that's what you (miners, the large kind) want knowing it won't happen, just so you can stall SegWit and continue to collect higher fees.
Also, let's not forget ASICBoost.

You have to keep in mind, the primary necessity for the fee market is to reduce "spam", as in, actual spam, the malicious anti-bitcoin, self-motivating kind. SatoshiDice micro-transactions aren't spam, despite having the same effect.
The options are as follows:
1. Fee market dynamically set by what users are willing to pay *(what we have now)*
2. No fees at all *(what we couldn't have anymore)*
3. Fees set by percentage *(what you're suggesting)*
4. Fees set with a static cost *(every tx no matter what size cost XX Satoshi)*
 Hypothetically, what would happen if fees were statically set to 0.1%? 
Every 1,000 Satoshi moved cost 1 Satoshi in fees? 
Or 1 Bitcoin would cost 1 mBTC to move?
What about a transaction that's 500 Satoshis? How would we calculate .5 Satoshis in fees? Would we ***round up***?
So anyone moving between 1 to 1000 Satoshis would have to pay the same fee of 1 Satoshi?
This becomes an issue as adoption grows and price moves upwards.
The issue is that at some point, whatever you set the percentage at, it starts becoming unfair for smaller transactions who may now be paying 1% instead of 0.1% per Satoshi, because of that rounding ***and*** you introduce a new issue where the fee % is the new primary debate within the community that requires a fork in the chain and the powers that be get their hands in that pot.
The only other option is to ***round down*** and make sub-1000 Satoshi transactions 0% fee. Then that incentivizes people breaking up their transactions into smaller amount just to get that sweet sweet discount, adding unnecessary transactions to the blockchain and loading up blocks even faster.
 Make all transactions cost a set amount (ie. 1/5/20/XX Satoshi)
As with  now we introduce the debate over changing the fees via protocol. "We're going to lose hashpower if we don't raise the fees", "no we're not you're wrong", "we need 'hard-dynamic' miner set fees based on miner signaling", blah blah, etc etc...With all of that comes potential forks and community splits and distractions from other developments.
Now that all transactions cost the same amount, miners start selecting the smallest (in bytes) transactions so they can fit as many as they can into a single block. This discriminates against larger (in bytes) transactions.
Then you can suggest making all transactions the same size and they all cost 1 Satoshi, now people who want to spam are free to do so just as effectively as they could now, if not worse.
I just don't see a workaround and believe the only good solution is the one we currently have.

While you have a point and I'll address it, let's not argue numbers to distract from the point.
***It's still a bad thing to do.***
Opposition likes to distract from the issues by changing the argument to something else. Not saying you are opposing anybody though. Although I do have a question, will you be providing your clients from your bitcoin casino with their share of BCC?
Anyway, back to your point:
All estimates are conservative.
I'm Bitmain. I control ~25% of the Bitcoin hashpower. 
I fork to BCC and now control ~50% of the hashpower.
*Yes this implies 40% left BTC, but the point is moot, I'm just explaining numbers with easy benchmarks, don't address a moot point.*
Difficulty is set to, let's say "10". Such that every 10 minutes, 1 block is created.
I decided to stop mining, and difficulty drops down to "5" to re-balance, blocks are still created 1 every 10 minutes.
I decide to start mining again, hashpower doubles, but difficulty stays the same for another 2016 blocks.
Blocks are created 1 every 5 minutes now.
This won't readjust for another 2016 blocks. 
***Yes, that's not in 2 weeks, it's in 1 week because they get created twice as fast.***
That's still 2016 blocks being exploited.
That's still the hard cap growth rate of Bitcoins being exploited.
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:59:28
...and then never include those low fees in their blocks.
The solution is to find alternative ways to distribute ***fee collecting*** to more people. People =/= Hash.

@_date: 2017-05-08 19:42:33
Yes it does because 30 transactions later when you want to go and spend 1 BTC and they are on 30 different addresses, ***THAT*** transaction is going to be larger.

Cloud mining is a scam hands down, no holds barred, unconditionally true, don't even try to argue otherwise.
NiceHash has this ***"differentiating"*** feature where you can "buy ***and*** sell" hashpower to other individuals.
Still a scam. Ask someone else why because it's been explained thousands of times.
Now for the good news: [**This is the current mempool size.**]( (It's very small and the weekend just began.)
Your transaction is in the green area since it's [***25.052 sat/B.***](
Every time a block is created, ~1 MB get's skimmed off the top of the mempool size (2nd chart).
As for why it has a lot of outputs, they are paying people out in bulk (cheaper for them), and I presume you are one of them in that list.
As for ~25 blocks, that is probably their estimate based off of non-up-to-date calculations of the mempool &amp; time it takes for XXsat/byte fees to confirm/get accepted.
~~It should actually confirm much sooner~~ [***It's been confirmed***]( because it's the weekend and the mempool is nothing like it was a month or two ago.

At any point, they (Antpool) can stop mining altogether and watch the mining difficulty ~~~immediately decrease. ***Then,*** they can start mining again with an extremely lower difficulty, and find blocks every minute, or 30 seconds, collecting the block reward that comes with it.
The difficulty won't adjust back up when they start mining because it's set to wait 2016 blocks to readjust the difficulty upwards.
This is a clear exploit in the system and I'm glad Bixin highlighted this as the most important reasoning behind their lack of support for BCC.
***All that being said...***This effects BCC, not BTC. You'll never see this implemented on the Bitcoin chain.

Let's not talk in hyperboles. You're ignoring my points and continuing to discuss future blocksize increases which is exactly what I'm trying to explain is the wrong move to make.
Someone could easily come along when we're at 4MB and say the same thing because that's what they are used to. 
Eventually that system falls apart under its own weight.
You can increase flow through a pipe and it will look fine. Then you can say "oh, this can handle more", and increase the pressure more.
Eventually you might even stop increasing the pressure and think things are okay...until they aren't and a pipe breaks a year later because you've been continuously running it with a load it couldn't handle long term.

We are nowhere near that point and by the time we are this won't be an issue.
Most people using exchanges are trading or buying and holding. People using Bitcoin right now to make "normal" purchases are still able to continue doing what they are doing because despite there being a potential chain split, the entire network is staying together.
Again, the exchanges don't want to be liable for lost coins on an alternate chain since there are no legal precedents that define their responsibility in that matter.

I realize we are relatively on the same side of the fence here, but all of this, ***the entire thing,*** every little bit and piece, is about never letting those in power control your ability to function in society by leveraging the money you posses.

Do you mean Bixins original post?
The wording can be interpreted multiple ways under a lens but I don't think that was their intent.
The argument goes, during a fork, the winner *(however you want to define winner so spare be the longest chain bullshit for now)* is "Bitcoin". So if Bitcoin Cash is allowed to be "the winner", then Bitcoin (BCC in this hypothetical) would have a backdoor to exploit, which is a risk.
One which Bixin will avoid by not mining on that chain to help the push for the ***other*** fork (BTC) to be the successful winner.
All that being said, I think the winner became clear after the Bitstamp and Coinbase announcements for most people, while the winner was known for quite some time by the higher-ups on both sides of the fence.
This whole fork debacle is just a money grab by Bitmain. A losing battle where they still profit more so than they would have if they did nothing.

Lightning Network is functional already and waiting on SegWit activation, but comes with its own scaling roadmap that is still being worked on.
Schnorr is in development too and requires another soft fork. We probably won't hear much on it until the dust settles from SegWit because it would only distract from getting SegWit activated. Expect roadmaps relatively soon.

[**If you're single and make $100,000**]( your ***wages*** fall into the 28% bracket:




Your total federal income tax on ***wages*** not factoring out deductions or anything else would be: **$20,981.75**
Your take home is **$79,018.25**.






If your capital gains from Bitcoin are another $100,000 your ***total income*** (not wages) is now $200,000.
***Your wage tax stays the same***, but your total income bracket is now in the 33% category.
33% bracket puts your [**long term capital gains tax at 15%.**](
Your $100,000 in Bitcoin is getting taxed $15,000.
 take home is $79,018.25 + $85,000 = **$164,018.25**
Let's change this up a bit though to stress the point a bit more:










You would be losing 20k (5%) because of a dollar difference.
And that's only 300,000 in capital gains.
Millions would be whatever that 5% difference is, ***but your wage tax stays unaffected.***
But, this also only matters when crossing the total threshold of ***$418,400.***

Yes, that's the last resort.
UASF for SegWit will be a nice demonstration to the miners and the rest of the community that we have control, not a centralized group of miners out for profit.
Moving forward, if they want to keep play games we know what to do.
Things need to happen gradually to ensure the community is on board for something like that, including proof that something like a UASF works, which they'll get in about 2 months.

I find it funny that two people responded back with basically the same thing.
This person is pondering something akin to pondering:


The response they get from pondering this is:


No fucking shit.
The person is pondering the implementation, not the formula.
Anyway, here's my suggestion:
1. Analyze the speed at which you are moving, ***somehow.***
2. Analyze the speed at which the object you wish to transfer onto is moving, ***somehow.***
3. Weigh yourself, and record your height, also, get metrics of different subsections of your height in accordance to your weight. Or even better, do the whole X,Y,Z plain at a resolution of 1 inch cubed (might not be accurate enough but it's ***something*** to go off of.)
4. Jot down a whole bunch of formulas to try and figure how to apply all those data points you just took, ***somehow.***
5. Apply said data when you jump, ***somehow.***
Jesus, imagine if a baseball player had to do all of this while he swung a bat?
What are sports? How do they do this without ***tools***?
The person is suggesting jumping like [**this,**]( at ***some*** angle, where the feet and presumably the grip of the shoe, (((***AND THE MUSCLES IN HIS BODY CONSTRICTING SO AS TO NOT WOBBLE OR ADD MORE DYNAMICS TO ALL THE MATHHHHHHHH***))), such that the opposing force (THE GROUND) is counteracted by the angle of the body and in turn makes the body go from angled, to upright, instead of upright to angled (face slamming on the ground).
It's possible, depending on the speed of the train, and whether you are wearing  $5 Costco kicks, or some sweet basketball sneakers with ankle support, or maybe you're wearing specialize footwear designed to make this procedure more efficient, who knows.
That is what was being pondered. Not the formula you dunces.

@_date: 2017-06-22 20:40:19
Andreas Antonopoulos explains the reasoning behind it all around the 3 minute mark [**in this video.**](
Essentially, it's determined by the fee market.
There can't be an intermediary that determines what ***is*** spam or what ***isn't*** spam because that intermediary would have too much power.
Originally, spam was made by just sending out 0 fee transactions. Anybody could do it and it clogged up the network, so fees were introduced.
Free transactions are very very valuable in the sense that anyone can store any form of data they want on the blockchain for free.
Any increase in block size would instantly result in all the free space being filled up by people taking advantage of free transactions, and malicious actors trying to bloat the network.

You're right but you're also wrong.
The problem here is all the old timers suffer from the [**Dunning-Kruger effect**]( or have some form of autism.
You're ***right*** in the sense that the older community needs to start realizing they will soon be the 1% and unless they start acknowledging the vernacular of the people they are answering is not up to par with their own, there's going to continue to be disparity.
You're ***wrong*** in the sense that the funds get returned to the wallet.
Maybe I can clarify for the OP (or anyone else who is interested and may not be technically literate):
The ***funds*** are really just an assignment of value stored on the blockchain. ***You never posses them.*** 
What you posses are private-keys that let you prove you have access to them by producing the matching address.
A --&gt; B
B = C
You posses A.
When you create a transaction, you sign with the private key (***A***) along with some other information and ***announce*** it to the network (bitcoin nodes/servers).
"Announcing" is like tweeting, once it's out there it's potentially forever out there. Some websites actually make an effort to save all tweets.
Some nodes (Bitcoin servers) make an effort to rebroadcast all transactions.
Anyone can rebroadcast that transaction once you send it out, but ***most*** nodes are configured to stop rebroadcasting old transactions.
Your transaction ***ideally*** gets scooped up by a miner, if the fee is high enough at the time, and then placed into a ***block***.
There's 1 block every ~10 minutes, so if the fee is on par, 1 confirmation should take ~10 minutes, 3 should take ~30.
If the fee is low, it may circulate for a while (usually until the weekend when traffic is low) and then get picked up by a miner.
If it's ***really low*** it may never get picked up by a miner and eventually get dropped from the ***mempool*** (server transaction history) , *if* no one rebroadcasts it.
tldr: 99% chance it clears within 2-3 weeks if it doesn't get picked up over the weekends.

The problem is, the precedent of doubling the blocksize has already been set, and we're fighting a battle to change that precedent.
It's not good to get too comfortable with a solution that "just works" while ignoring how over time, as the entire system scales upwards, that solution works a little bit less each time until one day you're that frog sitting in boiling water not jumping out because you go too comfortable.
It's not good to keep kicking the can down the road, and while "just 2MB seems like it would be an alright temporary solution, **we really do have better options right now*** that are being blocked by parties who don't want them implemented.
So what do they do? They pretend to back the 2MB solution, when it reality all it does is help them prevent the better solution.
I specifically want SegWit for Schnorr &amp; MAST first and foremost. Lightning Network is looking very good so far but it needs to be worked on, and it is by a large community of developers.

Are you asking why anyone should care about what they do with their altcoin chain?
If that is what you are asking, then you should care simply because this shows their underlying intent.
Which is to add backdoors and exploits that didn't exist into the protocol so they can exploit the system.
You'll notice that the changes tey go for are usually pretty simple, make ***X*** dynamic, or make ***Z*** dynamic.
Emergent Consensus is the epitome of all dynamic protocol changes they are trying to achieve. (Miners vote on blocksize dynamically).
***Nothing*** in the protocol is dynamic currently besides the difficulty change, and it's ~pseudo dynamic at best. Flat change up or down, every 2 weeks. Can't be voted on, can't be manipulated.
It's important because when they try and split the network ***again*** with their own client (just like we're seeing now), the people need to know not to back it because of these types of changes.

The concept of choice/will is arguably non-existent.
One could argue that the only reason you think the way you think is due to external factors completely out of your control that make you the way you are.
Just one gear in an ever moving complex mathematical equation...***arguably.***
Bitcoin works but it won't be ***viable*** for those who can really benefit from it's features *(third world individuals who ***want*** to improve but don't have access)* unless there is mass adoption, and mass adoption implies banks.
It goes hand in hand.
The main issue with Libertarians is they either don't realize their ideology requires different tiers of "woke-ness" among the population, or they don't want to admit it in fear of being labeled selfish/greedy/etc...
I say embrace it, there's no harm in admitting facts of life.
The stronger survive, but only because the ***group*** survives in numbers.
This isn't a conservative viewpoint either, because it can easily be argued that there are many capable and if not ***better*** people than you or I in respect to fundamental skill-sets that simply don't have the opportunity to thrive.
Bitcoins success is in *(or will be in)* it's ability to help present more opportunities to the ***have-nots*** by removing power from the establishment ***without*** taking away the freedoms of the more fortunate part of society *(you and I and pretty much everyone else on reddit).*
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:19:43
Disclaimer: I really don't know that much about finance, but this situation is actually pretty simple once it's grasped.
Look at it this way, and I'll try and keep it simple as I don't know all the ***technical*** words that are typically used:
1. You have a tax bracket that is determined by your total gross income.
2. You have your income gains (wages).
3. You have your capital gains (investments).
You pay income tax on your wages, and capital tax on your investments.
If your income is 50k, you only pay whatever the income tax is for 50k.
If your income is 100k, same thing.
The bracket you're in only affects the wages within that bracket.
If you're in a higher bracket because of capital gains, you don't have wages in that bracket to be affected by it, so no "additional tax".
Basically, no matter what you make in wages, the only tax that applies is standard income tax.
I'll provide an example that I hope should clarify this even better.






















Adam pays 20% on ***all*** of his ***capital gains.***
Bob pays 15% on ***all*** of his ***capital gains.***
Adam, Bob, and ~~Mary~~ Cindy all still pay $14,488.75 in federal income tax.

If you make $50,000 your LTCG rate is 15%, if you make $400,000 it's also 15%.
If you make 50k a year and you want to cash out, just make sure your total income for that year is under $418,400.
It will move your income tax bracket up but none of that income will actually get taxed because they are capital gains, so different rates apply (15% or 20% if your under/over  $418,400).
All that being said...You're still getting brutally raped by Uncle Sam.

Keep in mind I'm not a professional here.
Only difference in my examples if they were marginal would be any profit over that $400,000 value would then be taxed at 20%, which you may still want to avoid by spreading it out yearly and staying under $400,000 anyway.
I don't think this is the case though, as it would imply capital gains start where the income gains end, and two people who made the same amount in capital gains may be paying different margins for them because their normal income was different, which I don't believe to be fair.

You'd have to ask one of the developers, I don't code.
I've also tried asking them myself with no response, but with all due respect to them, we need to focus on getting SegWit first, we need to see the results, how LN develops, etc...
You'll probably see status updates afterwords with a timeline/proposal.
If Schnorr is ready, announcing it now would just be a distraction, as it would need a 2nd soft fork, and with a potential hardfork on the horizon, it would be foolish to muddy the waters.
But that's just my opinion.

No, terrible things won't happen if you increase it to 2MB. 
That doesn't mean we need it and I certainly don't want it right now until we see the true effects of SegWit and Schnorr and LN.
Terrible things will happen if you continue the blocksize doubling trend.
Terrible things will happen if you allow a flexible, dynamic system be built into the protocol at the base layer that is determined by voting. The only dynamic feature in the Bitcoin protocol is the difficulty, which can't be voted on through signaling and is very self regulating.
Continuing to increase the block size leads to "Emergent Consensus" type systems that will brutally damage the protocol.
It's not about 2MB, let's stop pretending it is.

But...to keep this game of silly rolling, your house analogy is backwards.
Developers made code that requires miners to do work for them, so in essence, ***miners are the contractors***.

The transaction format SegWit2x will be using is the normal SegWit transaction format, when SegWit gets activated.
Upon SegWit activation, both clients (SegWit2x client doesn't exist yet) will be operable together.
The only major difference is, the SegWit2x client will be pushing for a hardfork in about 3 months time after SegWit activation.
That could hypothetically cause a fork if it pans out, then you will have incompatibility.

It's not a "51% attack".
If 51% decided right now, to fork the *current* chaintip, then they would slowly gain a lead over time and end up successful.
The 49% could get lucky and ruin the 51%'s plan. The 51% could cave, too.
These aren't hard realities, but that would be a "51% attack".
But, these also aren't relevant to the situation at hand, because now we're talking about *going back in time*.
50% of the hashpower mining X, mines at the ~same speed as the other 50% mining Y.
If 50% goes back 2 days and starts mining a new chain, then they will always be ~2 days behind and ~2 days worth of blocks lighter in PoW.
Both entities are mining at the same speed.
If they had 51%, then they would be mining marginally faster, and would *eventually* catch up, but it would take them weeks if not months at that percentage, assuming they could even maintain that percentage.
Months of 2 chains fighting wouldn't even happen. Someone, somewhere, would cave way sooner than that. These are all people, and my guess is it will be someone involved in trying to reorg, or a miner pulling out of a pool misappropriating their hashpower.

Reads like a troll post but I'll bite.




[**What SegWit does.**](


Do you know what SegWit actually does? Try reading that link.


As block sizes go up, centralization grows. It becomes more and more difficult to run and maintain a node as blocks get larger. This minimizes the amount of people who have the ability to contribute to Bitcoin, and it's decentralization.
SegWit fixes malleability issues that more modern altcoins don't have. Resources by your PC when running a node are reduced, and because the transaction order is changed, many other features are opened up to be built on top of the blockchain.
Along with this, SegWit ***does*** provide a throughput increase.
Along with SegWit's intitial throughput increase, it allows things like [**Schnorr**]( and MAST, and the Lightning Network to flourish.
Schnorr would give us plenty of throughput without increasing the block size. It's like using [**one of these**]( to pack clothes into a suit case, *kinda*.
The more ***alternative*** ways to increase throughput the better.
You don't just make a car go faster by giving it a bigger and bigger fuel tank. All that does is make you have to stop less on your long trip. Does it make you get there slightly faster? Yeah.
You also don't just keep adding a bigger and bigger engine. You upgrade the shocks, tires, exhaust, exterior aerodynamics, turbo, spoilers, sway bars, air intake, spark plugs, super charger, drop the suspension, or raise the suspension if that's what you need to do.
Nobody here is opposed to raising the block size ***if we need it.***

Any transaction ignored by one set of miners would just be picked up by another set of miners.
Under the assumption that the protocol is understood by the person making the suggestion, it implied a protocol change.
Otherwise you're only delaying the processing of those transactions for a couple of blocks.
If it's not forced it won't happen.
If it's forced it has to be by protocol change, which sets a precedent that destroys Bitcoin.

I don't think 30MBs of transactions split into two 10-minute periods of 15MB dumps are dust consolidations from large entities.
Especially when they can get it done for even cheaper (or free) after SegWit.

I knew it was a feature but felt the distinction between SMS and non-SMS 2FA was clear by my first sentence.
I guess the intent here is to not confuse the new people.
For everyone else: [**Time-based One-time Password Algorithm**](
That is different than SMS 2FA (which is just a random PIN they generate and text you).
Apps like Google Authenticator and Authy make use of "*TOTP*" ***but*** if you're not careful the site you're logging into might default to SMS codes through the app if you don't pay attention.












~~So basically Authy provides both options and you need to make sure it's configured to work without SMS codes.~~ Authy backs up your *secrets* on their server, use Google Authenticator.

Couple of things I'll address without getting too technical.


You can't have something built into the protocol that let's you choose who you want to mine your transaction. That goes against everything that is decentralization.
You don't know who's doing your work, and you don't know who's transaction is who's when you're picking them (if you're a miner)
Fees regulate this system.


"Bidding" makes no sense, it's not how the protocol works at all. Transaction priority is determined by fee per byte. 
The whole purpose here is that no transaction is more important than another and the regulator to that is the fee structure.
Anything that goes against that goes against decentralization.


Miners take the top 1MB from their mempool and mine a block. There's no financial incentive to do anything else otherwise, and when you have mining to do, anything else is a resource hog.


One, I don't know what "bulk" miners means. Two, this prioritizes certain miners, which is against decentralization.


Again, this prioritizes people geographically and goes against decentralization, and that's not how transaction routing works at all.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:20:18
I think the question is, if UASF is the new precedent for upgrades, how often are the updates projected to be pushed out.
For example, Schnorr signatures would be another soft fork, likely a UASF, and so on with future protocol upgrades that don't require hard forks.
All of which have the potential to split the network if they are contentious.
Either that, or there's a misunderstanding here about how this UASF works, or correlating all UASF's with contention.

Not sure what you heard but there's nothing in the protocol that ever allowed anyone specifically to "block" anything.
Upgrades are external until they become internalized and the old is pushed out by the new.
Miners didn't want to upgrade, so the nodes are saying they're done waiting around for those guys.
If it works it works, the only real change here is, everyone knows the miners hand and entire deck now, so there's no going back to having secret cards that balance the game in their favor anymore.

This. There's an unlimited amount of seed variations you can use to divide your coins in case of coercion.
I posted this above but I'll post it here too:
Have a key:
Permute that key with SHA256 by adding something to the end or wherever you want:


This is your actual private key:
Take the ***original*** key, permute it with a ***different*** passcode through SHA256:


This is your dummy key that you send a smaller amount to in case of attempted coercion:
There are many ways to scramble a seed key, this is just one example.
There is an astronomical amount of entropy available if you remember 3 different scrambling steps and the order you use them.
Change 1 of those steps and you get 2 completely different keys that would never be tied together.

You're not the first or the last to ask that question.

If you see any returns at all from even a single alt coin that you couldn't have gained holding Bitcoin, it will most likely only cover the total amount you wasted putting 10$ into every alt.

Yes but currently the "price" isn't "zero".
You still need someone with the competent technical skills to know what they are doing because the resources for storing data like this aren't widely available.
Time and skill have a value too.
In the future most definitely, blocks will be consistently full, but right now I don't think that's the case.
Which leads be to believe this is malicious behavior.
**Edit:** Please note, as this is at the top, I put "spam" in quotes in the title to imply that spam is a matter of perspective, not my definition.

The people who are aware of it and believe/"know" it has an effect versus those who don't is asymmetric.
Regardless, it still creates a sudden supply shock, and demand (and the trend in its growth rate) is relatively consistent before and after the reward halves. When supply goes down but demand stays the same the price goes up.

I don't think we're at much of a real disagreement here although terminology might be throwing us off a bit.


I wouldn't correlate short term fee disparity with price at all. In two months we have very well have SegWit and the fees will be minimal while the price continues its upward trend.
The speed bump I was referring to was in *"consensus"* to adopt specific code into the protocol.


I agree, I also think high input transactions are a big factor in this as well, something SegWit+Schnorr would alleviate.


It's more a matter of, Uber presented a new system, and ***people*** opted in. Some of which were old Uber drivers. People also opt to continue starving in Africa, it doesn't mean that from ***my*** perspective, the lifestyle isn't a clusterfuck of chaos. It's a subjective opinion of mine. Some people don't have any other job choice.
That being said, I have sympathy for those people, I ***don't*** have sympathy for monopolized large scale mining operations.


Again, just terminology here, but what about worker ants? No one dictates them, but they do the work. Just a metaphor, I don't really want to debate semantics.


I would say specialization requires resources that could otherwise contribute to decentralization, but I also think things like the Lightning Network work to resolve this a bit by distributing the fee collection process to a larger group of network contributors, again, we need SegWit. (Not that I think you're opposed, that's more for others reading who may still be on the fence or not understand what's going on.)

The amount of Bitcoin that moves doesn't determine it's price.

@_date: 2017-06-13 17:08:53
The network doesn't know what "price" means.
It only knows what addresses have what amounts of BTC on them.
If I move my coins, that wasn't a sale, it was a transfer of BTC, the network has no way of knowing.
The only way around this to create a decentralized exchange, which is being worked on by groups like [**Bitsquare/bisq.**](
If a platform like this ever grows to something significant (which I imagine it would eventually) it would then be up to the responsibility of wallet developers to include in their software a pull request for the current price from that network.
This is not something you'd want built into Bitcoin's base layer protocol as it would add bloat to nodes by requiring them to handle more processes than they need to.
Also, that price would simply reflect the current price on ***that*** decentralized exchange.
It wouldn't be able to take an average across multiple markets because who would decide what markets get added and what don't?
Then the protocol would have to be regularly updated based on those hypothetical decisions to handle all of these 3rd party [**APIs**]( which is not feasible as they would regularly change.
Not something you want in Bitcoins protocol.

You've completely misunderstood whatever information you came across.
Block rewards half until  ~2***1***40.
Miners collect fees.
The financial incentive to support the network (mining fees being 1 aspect of support, running a full node being another) will always be there.

Pretty much this. Early adoption doesn't just mean knowledgeable users.
That being said, I'm fairly knowledgeable on this subject and I'm still buying.
The price will continue to trend upwards.
In the event of a fork, one will be the winner and many people will buy even more when/if the price on the winning chain does a brief dip before the dust settles. 
Demand appears to only be growing because once you become a holder you've already decided it's ride or die and low prices just make you want to buy more, which only increases demand.

My initial concern was you were a BU troll, or in the BU camp at all.
I think this whole situation is going to come down to just how much of the economic community is in support of the UASF vs how much is against it.
I think most people are neutral but Pro-SegWit so they'll accept whichever becomes the dominant chain in the aftermath on August 1st so long as it's not BU/EC, but I do have a feeling that majority support the UASF in one way or another.
I'm not opposed to bigger blocks down the road, I just think they are unneccesary right now when you consider things like Schnorr and MAST, even if you are one to consider Lightning Network controversial or not.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:34:02
Adoption of a limited supply of any resource makes the value of that resource trend upwards.
Speculation of it's current adoption levels along with people who play the markets daily causes bubbles.
Bubbles pop. Bubbles can be any size, and popping/correcting can take days or years.
When the bubble pops, the new price floor is higher than the last.
If you plot these floors you see what ***I*** call the ***adoption curve.***
The adoption curve always rises, so Bitcoins price goes up.

It's not but we are definitely hitting a speed-bump. We'll get through this.
Actually, the issue here aren't the fees themselves, it's the lack of optimization to the system that would benefit the end users.
Uber drivers get brutally fucked when it comes to income, that being said...there's still plenty of Uber drivers to go around.
Miners are the drivers, as they should be, and when we change the system to lower their income, there will still be plenty of miners to go around.

I prefer to use a Linux Live CD, like Ubuntu, then I visit the website, pull out my ethernet cable, do what I need to do, then shut down my computer.
Alternatively, all you need to do is generate any random HEX string, 64 characters long composed of ***only:*** ABCDEF0123456789.
[**Here is a website**]( you can use to generate random strings.
Use [**these settings**]( on that site and hit enter. **Do this offline.**
Alternatively to the alternative, write down 64 characters yourself. That's your new private key.
Then go to one of those 3 websites I listed in the beginning and put that string into the box and it will generate your public key and address for you.
Then send your coins to that address and you now have a cold storage key.
Don't lose it.
**Disclaimer: Whenever you decide to recover your coins, SWEEP THE ENTIRE PAPER WALLET. Otherwise you will lose the [**change.**](

No, they aren't tied together. I was merely elaborating on the value of free space for people looking to permanently store data on the blockchain.
Limiting the block size is done for completely different reasons and that's its own subject/debate.
I'm simply saying one of the ***results*** from an increase in block size would be spam filling up the empty space.
No matter the size of the block, empty space would be filled up, that's all.

Unfortunately that's the entire point here. I'm trying to help you understand that there ***isn't*** a clear definition of what spam is.
There's no way to know. All transactions that send Bitcoin from one address to another is valuable to ***someone*** in ***some*** way.
The fee market determines that priority.
If you were an individual that wanted to bloat the network by creating millions of transactions, you now have to compete with me, who's paying a (hypothetically) $0.0X fee for my coffee, by adding a fee to every single one of your ***"spam"*** transactions.
Each of your million transactions are now going to cost you as much as my coffee fee, plus your micro payment of 1 Satoshi that you're arbitrarily sending from one address to another, if you want to knock me and everyone else down under yours, ***for whatever reason you wanted to do so.***
You're initial post was correct.
Spam ***is*** subjective within the Bitcoin network, and fees are the network regulators, in a sense.

Long Term (over a year) Capital Gains tax here is 15% for most people.
In the US we have tax brackets for ***income tax***:






























The increased % only applies to the income made ***after*** the previous threshold ***on income tax.***
Long term capital gains won't get included in income tax but will still trigger a new income tax bracket, just none of that income is ***"income taxable".***
All of the gain will be set at 15% for most people unless you pass the income tax bracket threshold from 35% to 39.6%.
Hedging your losses in capital gains only works if you know one year you'll be making ***X*** or another year you'll be making ***Y***, where X is under $418,400 and Y is over $418,400.
You adjust your cash-out accordingly to your expected income.
Long Term Capital gains changes from 15% to 20% (5% loss of 1 million is 50k) after you pass from the 35% into the ***39.6%*** tax bracket, which is at ***$418,400.***
So if you really want to, if you make 50k a year currently, only cash out $350,000 this year, and $350,000 next year and so on.

Core is just the client you use, the protocol is the protocol, and no, once it's announced to the world, they propogate until they don't. Some nodes intentionally rebroadcast old transactions, but the Core client is supposed to stop broadcasting old transactions.

Paper wallet == cold storage.

Cold storage means your keys, or seeds are completely stored offline and inaccessible to anyone else unless they are put into a machine that is connected to the internet.


Ignoring your misunderstanding here, a paper wallet is literally your key stored on a piece of paper. A compromised computer can't steal a piece of paper.

There's no single entity pushing buttons trying to maintain power at all costs.
Government corruption is ***systemic.*** It's a bunch of individuals all trying to play their cards.
The reason something like Wikileaks is almost unanimously hated within the government is because everyone has secrets and what they all understand is: **"If *my* secrets get revealed I'm fucked."**
They coincidentally and opportunistically band together to defame Wikileaks because they all have a shared known and ***tangible fear*** of it.
This effect isn't happening with Bitcoin *(yet)* because most people in government don't understand the consequences or legitimacy of Bitcoins effect the way they understand: **"oh no muh secrets"**
By the time there's a firm understanding of what a decentralized currency really means by everyone in government, Bitcoin's foothold will be well established *(it arguably already is)* and even then, most people aren't scared of the money, they're scared of their secrets being told to the world.
People good at ***the game*** are good because they break the arbitrary ethical rules of life and only abide by the hard-coded/true rules of life. They aren't scared of that hard code changing with the times *(technological advancement)*, they're scared of how they broke the ***ethical*** rules getting out, because that's how you lose the game.

 this means for new users / people out of the loop:
The ***mempool*** is a term we use for a backlog of transactions that get built up over time.
During high traffic periods that backlog grows, and vise versa during low traffic periods.
Miners select the higher paying transactions for [**economic reasons**]( *(as they should be doing)*, so as the backlog grows, low fee transactions get ***"stuck"*** in the mempool, causing many people's transactions to never get [**confirmed**]( *(accepted into a block)*.
Those low fee transactions are now starting to clear (confirm), so overall fees will start to go down.
 this means for ***everyone:***
Please start adjusting your fees to represent the current state of the network.
Fees ***were*** high, let's not keep them that way.
Please lower your default fees, or atleast allow us to set our own (talking to you Coinbase...) [**You're only propagating the issue.**](
Average 1 to 1 transaction is around 225 bytes.
Set up a pretend transfer from your Coinbase account and divide the estimated network fee (right now 0.00087557) by 225 and you get ~350-400. 
This is unnecessary, at least provide an opt in setting to allow manual network fees where the user accepts all risk once the transaction is sent.

Thing is...you need to make sure that exchange supports ***both*** chains, and have your coins on that exchange ***before*** the split, so that the exchange does all the work for you.
Otherwise, you would have to download Jihan's client, run it, ***trust it***, send your coins from that chain to a compatible exchange and then sell them off.
There may be some wallets that provide both options, we'll have to see.

Oh look, ***another*** shill account using typical vernacular.
Dead account for 7 months that was used to shill in and now active again in the Bitcoin community.
[**You friends**]( with ??? 
History looks ***awfully*** familiar...
[**Comments**]( have striking [**similarities...**](
Congrats, you just got yourself tagged.
I recommend never using the word substantiate again because you're only ousting yourself.
Here's a [**list of synonyms**]( instead for future use.

We have time for laymen terms to develop.
***Showing*** the mBTC price on an exchanges front page is what we should aim for.

A thousand people aren't banding together to do maintenance at the same time [**within a span of 15 minutes.**](
Maintenance or not, growth still has a curve to it.
You tell 100,000 to jump and the same time and use a high-speed camera to break down the microsecond response times, you'll see a natural curve on a graph.
If 1000 of those people had an atomic clock and all planned to jump at the ***perfect*** correct time, and you graphed them separately, you'd still see a natural curve of early and late people within that subset.
[**This**]( is not [**that.**](
If you look at the original picture, you can see there is a very clear and distributed period of low fees and low unconfirmed transactions.
At two ***very distinct*** brief periods during that time period we see huge spikes, it's very clear this was a single entity/group doing ***something.*** Not a large body of self serving individuals with the same idea (maintenance) in mind.

mBTC is the technical unit.
***Millibits*** makes the nerds cringe but in reality, milli-bitcoins *(if it gets used)* ***will*** be shortened to millibits or milli's by common folk.
If we go straight to ***bits*** (uBTC)  then it won't matter, but now we're assuming a $100,000 Bitcoin. *(Which I'm totally okay with.)*
But bits also get the aspies mad because bits ***must and should only mean*** 8 bytes because my grandma will totally get confused over that if it doesn't...

I misread it. Thought it was the same (hot wallet) address, but not a single TX.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:18:33
We were ***artificially*** at $1,000 for ***less than a month*** at that time.

All potential sizes are arbitrary in one way or another, but having ***a*** size is ***necessary***.
Having too large of a size poses a risk to decentralization, blocks will be spammed until they are full of free transactions carrying data people want to store.
Having a flexible size built into the protocol is a ***serious risk*** to decentralization, miner strength is determined by monetary power currently, and nodes can be sybil attacked.
Having too low of a size doesn't increase decentralization and only increases artificial demand and higher fees to transact on chain.
Changing the average block times to be shorter/longer has the same net effects.
The only ***realistic*** solution is to look at ***what we currently have*** and weigh the available options for ***what we could currently implement.***
[**Schnorr signatures**]( will open up so much space on the chain without changing anything I've mentioned above and is currently ***the best*** scaling solution we currently have that is near ready to implement.
It requires SegWit, which ***also*** has a net effect of a higher level transaction throughput , as well as opens the door for a cornucopia of second layer features we can implement without changing what we currently have in regards to the block size.
There is no end-all-be-all one time sweeping solution to this thing. It's an ongoing effort and anyone who tries to tell you that there needs to be a permanent "full" solution to scaling is either very short sighted, or trying to herd you like a sheep for ulterior reasons.

Do you know what the satoshi/byte was for your transaction? 
For example, [**here's**]( a random transaction, and the 4th row on the right shows the satoshi per byte that was paid in fees.
[**Here's a nice mempool chart for reference.**](
I've highlighted the weekends in [**this 30 day snapshot.**](
As you can see, the 10-20 (Purple) range started to clear over the last weekend.
Currently, in the [**2 day chart,**]( we can see that the 100-120 range is ***not*** clearing. *(Slightly brighter purple, 7 layers above the other purple.)*
If you're transaction has been stuck in the mempool for a month, then it would have to be between 0-20 Satoshi/byte, as all the above have cleared recently.

It almost actually makes it look like a bubble.
It's just a logarithmic chart though, it's just not as wide as they usually are.

You reinstall new wallet software and import with your seed.
