I uninstalled due to this.  The only thing I used it for was the home screen btc price widget.  Mycelium - please add that to your amazing app!

What about the new "AutoInvest" feature they added?  I was going to try it out, but it requires 1 btc minimum!

Nice, I've been looking for something similar.

Use a credit union?

Same here.  James is awesome!

Do you currently have a website?

I wonder if the blockchain.info app queries the server to obtain a new address?  If so, couldn't this be a MITM attack?  Regardless of the private key, the hacker could always return the same compromised address.

Then, like rnvk stated, do you plan on automatically converting your bitcoin when a sale is made or do you want to keep bitcoin and wait for a better day to sell?  Btw- I'm in KC also, good to see there are more enthusiasts!

I've got some 1st generation miners laying around.  Are you in the U.S. Midwest by chance?
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:26:02
LOL, hilarious!

I guess this sounds weird, but would you be interested in hosting some of my miners?  We could work something out, like split the results 50/50.  
@_date: 2015-09-19 16:55:59
Exactly, I though Theymos owned that also...
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:59:50
Thank You for this.  First time I've seen it!

How can tradeblock and statoshi be so far off from one another?  Which is most accurate?
My node:  {

Do tell what the new use is or might be!

I am a fan of the "ponzi" sites.  They aren't a true ponzi as everything is up front and verifiable.  It's a game based on early entries being paid by later entries.  Check it out 7DayPonzi.com
