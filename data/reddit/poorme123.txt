Yeah, sucks, i actually thought about the book idea but was afraid of it inadvertently disappearing, or burning up in a fire (not that the lockbox would have sustained much of a fire).  I guess I was relying on it being relatively hidden and no one knowing about it...just a false sense of security since i've never had anything of any real value stolen from me outside of a locker room or a coat at a party, etc

Really?  So you have to have a program to decode it?  I guess I liked the paper wallet because it was completely self contained, but obviously that is something of a downfall.

I do.  And that feels really weird to admit.

Yeah, i actually think that is going to be the worst part.  It's not like he was my best friend, but I don't have any proof and it's going to be a lot of suspicion and thinking everything he does is some guilty behavior.  I can't tell everyone (or anyone, really) to stop hanging out with him if I'd end up being the bad guy and lose a whole group of friends over it.  Ugh, not going to think about that for now.
For now, though, the worst part is the actual loss.

Yeah, I wasn't sure how to word things without making it sound like that aside from 'I'm not fishing for tips'...but that just seemed even *more* like I was 'fishing'...whatever...

It was about two and a half days, which was why I didn't immediately think of it at the time.  
It was the wallet, about $200 cash and some (probably worthless) coins I was saving.

It was a paper wallet, seems i forgot to say that specifically.  Downloaded the offline address generator, printed it out from a computer (vm) with no connection to the internet.  All very safe, from what I could tell, from any possible online or malware threat.  Just not safe from the real world.

Yeah, I can't remember is it was a pm or regular reply, but I guess I know the friend part is much worse, but it's not really that particular friend I'm concerned about, but what it will mean to some other friends.  I guess shock sets in in different stages, and the money part was easier to be upset about at the moment.
As far as walking away from that group of friends, they have no idea what happened, and I'm sure they'll be just as shocked to think he might have done it as I was.  Plus, there's still some possibility that maybe he didn't do it, but maybe mentioned it to someone else who knew more about what to look for?  I don't know, lot of stuff going through my head right now and I don't want to start accusing him and end up being the asshole who should get kicked out of the group if I am wrong...
