I do not give a shit if he was a scum bag. This trail is now the precedent for internet freedom. This is 100000000000 times bigger than ross himself. If he was a good person, its sad.

I hate to say it and will probably get downvoted but this is the reason why bitcoin is going nowhere right now. Until the day its safer to put your entire savings into bitcoin without being a computer nerd is the day it will go to the moon. Until then its the boy who cried wolf and fake pumps

West cost is 1/20th of the way. People still get jailed for weed here. Lives still get ruined. But I agree 100% with you other than that. I feel you brother

The amount of stress involved with bitcoin is too much for me. Shit like this.. I tapped out and sold everything at 390. Shit will give you cancer.
