Thanks for the heads up, it's a great service. It's been years since I last bought any credit.
They pass on processor fees to customers who top up less than 25 USD and it's a different fee if you buy from outside the US, which makes me feel a bit discriminated.
As a low volume user it's great to know I can now pay with bitcoin with no transaction fee.

This may help:

Same result, thanks.

Seems like a natural match. I've known of at least three digital artists whose Paypal accounts were terminated for doing porn commissions. Not just temporarily limited, Paypal banned them forever.
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:39:21
Ok, thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:19:21
Same generic reply I got. I was not even trying to use a credit card as implied in their message, but a bank account.

Since that site says users will be able to link a bank account, I'm hoping that means it will take advantage of SPEI transfers, meaning immediate funding and withdrawing.
I opened a US bank account on a border crossing and use Coinbase which is great, even with the ridiculous ACH delay. But being able to directly use an account in Mexico would remove big hurdles for me and that would be awesome.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:01:25
Also great for Mexicans who want to cash out their own bitcoin I guess. On Volabit it's easy, but a bank account is needed.

Oh, yes, frequent bitcoin articles on Slashdot. I disregarded a few, until the words "deflationary currency" got my attention.
I already had had a couple good hunches before, but I missed the boat by not acting. This time I'm glad I did something about it and got me a decent amount of BTC.

No idea. Oxxo stores vastly outnumber 7-Elevens.
About retailers, not many, according to this: 
Famsa is of interest. They sell appliances, forniture, electronics.
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:38:51
Not even https secure connection.
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:00:09
Actually only $30 MXN at an Oxxo store.

On Volabit it only takes a few minutes to buy bitcoin and have it sent to a wallet.
As far as I can tell anybody can in fact open an account there and enter the data of Mexican bank accounts to directly put money in them by selling bitcoin.
No ID verification is needed if transactions are kept below 500 USD a day.
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:20:56
There seem to be two options for USD funding:
* Deposit US dollars via international wire
* Deposit US dollars instantly via webbank
For the second option money is sent via Astropay and allowed countries are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia (they spelled it "Columbia"), Peru and Uruguay.
I'm not verified. I didn't even sign up! I was able to view those forms simply because I have the noscript addon installed. Otherwise all that is hidden behind a login form. Really weird.
@_date: 2014-01-23 20:40:22
I'm pretty sure he meant "Cabo" San Lucas.

Actually you initiate a transfer of pesos. You get a bank account number, no codes, the teller at the store types the account number and you pay the precise amount (plus a store fee). In some cases there's a short deadline.
The "confirmation code" is just a bunch of digits printed on the cash register slip from the store. You type those tiny faint digits on the website and you get pesos credited a few minutes later. Then you buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:46:33
Nope, that's not it. I hardly ever use tor. Bank transfers get denied anyway.
@_date: 2014-09-16 00:20:57
Report of poor experience: 
Misspelling-ridden site. One week old fiat transfer hasn't shown up on user's account and support is unresponsive.

The Argentinian leg is actually processed by Satoshitango.com. They call this system Coinnect.
@_date: 2014-08-12 00:38:44
If the account balance is in one of the other 20 currencies, will it be first converted to USD (incurring a fee) in order to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:30:33
I agree, Namesilo.
I've already transferred two domains out of name.com to Namesilo and paid using bitcoin. On Name.com I once ended up paying 4 dollars for the privacy because I didn't know the stupid coupon I had been using had changed.
[Here]( an interview with the founder of Namesilo.

So in practice *anybody* in the world can put money into *any* Mexican bank account?

I bought a Pi 2 there in July with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-07 19:19:36
My same situation, I use Circle.com.
Buying didn't work at first, I had to submit a ticket. No problems after that.
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:31:27
There's only a countdown timer on bitcoinbrothers.co.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:13:42
You shouldn't post referral links. It's on the sidebar.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:16:18
Bitsumo.com. I've never used it, but it's been around for a while.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:09:55
Recently Volabit.com (I've used it a few times, no problems) introduced "magic addresses" in which bitcoin is instantly converted to pesos. There's no announcement, just an email that was sent to users. Also, as far as I understand, the user can make SPEI deposits to third party Mexican bank accounts, which usually take a few minutes during banking hours.
So I guess you'll have to shop around for convenience and fees on Volabit, Bitso and Mexbt.

I ordered a Raspberry Pi 2.
It's the first time I attempt to buy from a US based website that I don't get my cards rejected or am told that a foreign Paypal account won't work there.
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:07:28
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:51:37
If they convert to pesos, do you know what services they use?
There's a Spanish speaking forum where questions about sending payments to Argentina pop up frequently. As expected, everybody suggests Paypal, Western Union and Payoneer and that's killing me. I'm afraid to suggest they try bitcoin because I have no real experience to show regarding Argentina.
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:45:36
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:13:18
Or a way for locals to cash out.

Keepass sucks on Linux, I couldn't even properly copy and paste passwords. I removed it along with mono and installed Keepassx.
@_date: 2016-05-08 20:58:06
There are lots of VPS providers that take bitcoin:
That's how I found mine (Gestion DBI) and I'm happy enough so far.
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:33:26
It's not difficult at all.
On Volabit, the *cumbersome* part is copying long numbers from the tickets you get at the convenience stores, but from then on you're short minutes away from getting your bitcoin and sending it out.
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:18:05
Mexico should be green. Exchanges are legally operating with no special licensing and getting or selling bitcoin is easy.
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:36:24
That's too bad. I hope you'll find it.
That's why I stored my Electrum seed in a place where I can always find it: my own memory. It's not that hard, really.
