Yea should have titled it differently. I meant every user (enthusiast, holder, trader..) of cryptocurrency.

Is electrum much better than blockchain? Im deciding whether to change the wallet or not.

No. Btc is a currency and an extremely volatile one. You cant predict that the price will rise infinitely. There are always ups and downs. Also the price may go pretty down if governmants ban bitcoin etc.

Dont invest what you cant afford to lose. Thats the general rule. Other than holding btc you may trade, gamble or start some business concerning btc.

Yes all MLMs should be banned. 
I was once invited by a friend to this "economical session". Turned out it was Amway seminar (MLM company). I stayed there for about an hour to observe.
 After some shitty presentation regarding their products all of us were individually approached by some team leaders. All they did was praising the money and that with the money we make through them we will me swarmed by best girls and the most expensive cars. Then they asked us about contacts for our friends so they could try to scamm them as well. 
Note that 80% of people there were young students or elders.

I feel ya. A very close friend of mine - a girl with zero technological knowledge 'owns' 7000€ worth of onecoin. I've been trying to explain it's a scam but she's very stubborn. When I ask her if she can withdrawl her money the answer is no BUT she doesn't want to. She's waiting till you can pay with onecoin. 
The worst part is that she convinced another 20 or more people to spend their money on that shit. She's been completely brainwashed by the company and there's zero chance for her redemption. 
When she tried to persuade me into the said scam I told her the truth and that I own bitcoins in addition to other crypto like ether. She was all like wtf why would you buy bitcoin when it's so expensive - onecoin is the future. Nowadays when she speaks about crypto in a group I just go grab a drink and don't say anything.
 Save your dad while you can!  Hope this gave you some insight about the shitcoin.

Well she does. And she is claming that they are about that go on open market and that she's very interested what will happen. 
Poor girl.
