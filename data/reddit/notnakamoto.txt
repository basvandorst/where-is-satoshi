A friend of mine was sort of abducted by an indian taxi driver in Dubai. She then started to threaten him of deportation etc and he let her go.

I am using segwit addresses for many months now, why is this Coinbase so slow implementing it?
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:59:19
it is an unusual situation at the moment and it is not yet known for 100% where we are going

@_date: 2018-02-16 10:55:41
many people thought the same about bitcoin back in 2009...you have to gamble in a sense
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:54:57
good point
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:01:40
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:39:20

this is a good advice pretty much for any developed country - do not buy air
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:50:01
you have got a sharp eye
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:12:48
hmm, debit cards are usually linked to a bank account, aren't they?
Anyway, I would recommend to avoid any bank cards to be used in crypto, just in case.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:19:38
to scare people off crypto and to repurchase cheap
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:23:45
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:09:06

@_date: 2018-04-30 10:14:44
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:15:05
No need to do it. These are the most popular reasons you can use to shutdown anything: terrorism, money laundering, human/drug trafficking. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:18:17

@_date: 2018-04-23 15:58:06
Thank you, captain obvious. Clearly it will get much bigger
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:59:59
very expensive purchase, those machines usually charge like 10%+ for the purchase
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:10:36
What sort of answer would you expect from a statement 'my AV found a virus, what is it?'
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:23:39
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:23:29
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:12:20
of course, it will recover sooner or later...probably later.
