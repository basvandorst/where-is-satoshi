Which is why it will never be anything more than MLM with more steps. Unless, some *gasp* regulations are introduced. 
It's supposed to be cryptocurrency, not cryptoholding.

Go ahead and read my post again. The caveat to that audit would be a cash transaction over $10k with no explanation **i.e. probable cause**. The only thing that's clear here is that you're a moron.

Yeah... and the federal government can easily track and regulate the movements of USD so sure you can launder the money with cash but good luck spending any large sum of it without being audited. 
As Bitcoin has no such checks, it is a bitcoin problem. Decentralized currency is a great concept until you remember that, for better or for worse, financial regulations exist for a friggin reason.

...have you ever made a cash deposit to a bank of $10,000 or more?

You've got a real liquid asset there lmfao. 
Privacy is important to me, but so is the protection of my assets. And if something goes wrong during a transfer and you're out $20k in crypto then guess what, the government won't have to explain aaaaanything to you. :) Because in an unregulated market you have zero risk protection.

It's called a trade-off. It's crazy to me that you would be willing to potentially lose everything just so you could buy milk anonymously. I can do that too with a $5 bill. 
Would you want to live in a society that had no laws just so you could piss in the street without being fined?

I love that you have such strong conviction with this, yet are so, so wrong. First of all, I am familiar with the Bill of Rights. Thank you for quoting that to me twice now.
The federal government requires a bank to report all cash deposits of $10,000+ to the IRS. An undocumented transaction of that amount constitutes probable cause for an investigation. Maybe English isn't your first language because your reading comprehension skills are absolute dogshit. 


I'm not asking you to explain anything, so don't know why you included that.


No, you don't. The IRS will audit you. And good luck spending more than $10,000 cash without being audited either. You're acting like I'm deciding any of this when it's a government agency. This is all very basic so hopefully you're either trolling at this point or you will realize you are a dolt and not respond to this.

The security is very real. You can't admit that even though basic things like fraud protection exist because your entire argument is predicated on the idea that any form of regulation is inherently bad. The lack of regulation on cryptos is very real too which is part of the reason why the "market" is so volatile. And if there ever comes a point that it does exist then you have a regulated market. Which will almost definitely end up happening.


It's called an analogy, I'm not breaking it down for you because it's fairly straightforward. It's kind of absurd that you took that literally tbh.
