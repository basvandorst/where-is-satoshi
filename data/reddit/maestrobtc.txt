I tried Abra on my backup Android phone.  Loaded $20 from my bank account into my wallet.  Withdrew $10 of the money back to my bank account.  I sent $5 to a friend who also withdrew the money from his account.  All worked fine.  So far I don't have any problems with Abra and I think the vision and promise are awesome.  I'm super excited about the teller launch they just announced.  I signed up to be a teller.  It may not be a huge deal in the Philippines as Godfree said but if they get it right I think it will be a big deal in many other countries in South America, Africa, Asia, etc.

The idea of pegging bitcoin value to fiat for newbies is very compelling. I'm super excited about the teller launch they just announced and of course I signed up to be a teller. If they get it right I think it will be a big deal in many countries in South America, Africa, Asia, etc.

mentioned in my comment below that I've tried the app and it seems to work fine.  Love the teller model.  It may not work well in PH as you say but I'm convinced it will be a hit in other markets if they get the experience right. Being able to move between fiat and bitcoin is super interesting to me. We'll see.

seems like an unfair and baseless comment to me.  I did a search and found a few articles where they talked about how the tech works.  The app works in my tests and seems to be legit.
