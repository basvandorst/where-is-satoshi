Thats not what i mean at all...What i mean is: if i bought $100 in bitcoin 1 year ago, i want to sell $100 worth of bitcoin and get my initial post tax investment back. What im not sure of is this: 1) can you with draw your investment, while not touching gains, and not pay taxes on that withdrawl, much like you can with stocks. 2) how do i show that withdraw on my taxes? Do i even need to report it? Whats the process like? Hence why i phraised it as "do i need a jewish accountant" when trying to gague how much of an adult you have to be to pull something like this off.

Would the irs like to know that? Do i have to report that even though i shouldnt pay any tax on that? Should i just have an accountant do my taxes if i withdraw anything from any investment?

Noob here. Is there a trick to withdrawing the amount you invested with post tax $ with out touching the gains, so uncle sam cant tax me? I just want to take out the amount i invested, and play with house money, then buy again in the future. Is this possible, or do i need a Jewish accountant?

Yes clensing is great for the economy, but the fucking federal government wont let the con artists fail! They just bail them out with tax payer money.
