Haha I suppose that would be one option.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:26:40
No but that’s genius. I will thanks for the idea!
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:45:41
Haha thanks for the purchase! 
That was an idea by the way! Do you have a good group to pitch that to? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:10:16
It was a budget of $1,000 (fiat)
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:56:45
Long sleeve in that design coming up! I’ll post here when it’s up! 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:42:49
You got a guy? How so? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:58:23
You guys this is insane! First order from Canada and dope product ideas! Thanks for all the love and support. CRYPTO4LYFE! 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:28:22
Thanks so much! It’s crazy! 
People are paying in crypto now! 
I am shocked!
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:56:42
Eh, I mean in this case I really don’t know anything else about the guy
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:39:24
I heard whispers of that CNBC documentary. Sadly, I was not asked to appear in it. Mad oversight by someone at the top of you ask me. Gonna need to talk to my agent (full disclosure: I do not have an agent and people at the top do not know who I am.)
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:21:59
It is kinda dumb. But we’re glad you like it! 
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:26:47
On it! I’ll send it here with a coupon code for the idea
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:29:20
Haha thanks dude!
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:14:27
Why a B Corp? Over a C Corp or S Corp? 
An LLC was easiest for what I was trying to launch 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:22:35
Do they not?! That is going to make my third episode in this series very dull haha
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:15:14
Consider them added! What kind of design?
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:42:07
I like it. I’ll make it happen!
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:15:11
It's like no one ever wins at HQ, but the fact you COULD win cash was the gas that spread that fire.

u/konstantkrusher Thank you for inspiring our NEW signature SHE-toshi line for women. Working on building it out as we go... 
 
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:04:52


Wow, you weren't kidding. Ya bought one!
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:19:20
I need to add that. My B. Didn’t have time but I will add!
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:20:19
That’s the hope! Surprisingly not all coins agree! Cardano for example did not want to let me use their logo. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:15:51
Awesome idea. Thanks mate. I’ll hit that up
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:44:31
You got a deal! Part of the problem, and this is big for Printful feedback, is laying out the page so you don’t see the same design three times on different shirts. I think I can offer them through a different collection.
Part of the reason I didn’t was because a female coworker said she often buys in Men’s sizes. To be fair, she’s from Texas and I think that’s a thing down there. Loose fitting clothing and barbecue sauce. 
If there’s any other design you particularly want made as well lemme know! 
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:25:37
Yeah that’s the min. Higher processing fee and other drawbacks
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:14:21
That's my bad, I got a notice that the other post was flagged for removal because 'side hustle' set off a bot so I deleted it.

The Cardano Foundation. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:32:46
Haha glad you enjoyed it!
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:23:46
This game would be insane if it paid you in crypto when you won.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:20:38
I’ll take the fiat and burn it

When bitcoin is down, Binance becomes a very dark place to look, since it's all tied to the BTC price.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:48:06
I’ve only got $1000 to work with! And $400 of that went to starting an LLC. But now that I got some sales it’s better design time! Do you have any you recommend? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:32:55
Thanks dude!
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:50:26
Wow, somehow I missed these. GOLD.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:28:54
I’ll never leave again. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:24:27


@_date: 2018-04-21 03:36:05
I like this. I like this a lot. 
Only problem is using real people’s names on merch. Normally not an issue until you get big enough to where it is. Or if you have mainstream media lawyers who are very scared of anything that has crypto in it.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:28:49
Did you at least like the product description? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:16:53
u/blahcentral just added these:  
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:24:05
Ah I should have made TANKS! Swim trunks will be tough. Any design you want on a tank? 
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:04:04
Is that a no-no?
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:38:43
You can buy this one then. It’s “just” a crow:  and even my aunt who thinks bitcoin is a tiny form of European currency bought one. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:21:29
I found that guy afterwards. My mom raised me to only say nice things about people. He has a dope green screen.

I’ve sold like 8 shirts in 24 hours. Business is booming!
