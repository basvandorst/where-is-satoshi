BU is getting more adoption too... Do you think that might help?
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:26:59
ok thanks! but then why do it require a 95% threshold to get activated? I though softfork only needed a 51% approval to be safely adopted by the network?

I dont really know how popular it is but based on the search I made it's not very popular :/ I'm currently in Istanbul and I can't find an ATM accept one near the airport I think

lol I get your point :) But if you want adoption, you need to be willing to do a bit of compromise... IMO Bitcoin debit card is one of the necessary steps toward mainstream adoption

Dw, I've been advised that some people here were like that

You find a guy that is willing to swap it for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:15:53
No its really awesome, you just need an address. They say that they will ask for some ID after a couple order but already bought for a couple thousand and they did ask anything yet

Diversification bro

I would replace "New paradigm" by "Dan Bilzerian just bought"

Every price is manipulated... Our whole lives are manipulated, all you can do is find the game plan and frontrun it

Fuck Roger V. this guy is bitcoin Jesus now
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:53:59
lol, you just created a bit of doubt in my mind

I dont know if you used Bitcoin recently but it's more like 2USD if you want to get processed within the hour for an average size transaction. If you compare Bitcoin with Paypal, of course, Bitcoin will certainly be dominant in the illicit markets and Paypal in the "legit" ones.

I'd say charity / tipping on the 3rd place
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:17:34
Gambling is definitely in the top three use case for bitcoin...
