I meant that I just felt the impact of high fees as it didn't affect me before.

Funny thing, fee seems different for different people. Mine was $40 from one account, but $22 from a diff account in the same wallet. 
Your was $11 and someone else said they paid $30-$40 for $100 bucks.

Thanks for the link, once I tried to move bitcoins between accounts o the same HW Wallet, but the transactions never confirmed and it returned to original account. 
I guess I am a bit confused, as to how I should properly set a custom fee that will actually get processed at some point.

I wonder if we pool people's dream together if it would be a good predictor of the market :)

Still a major problem tho, also the limbo phase when transferring bitcoins is nerve racking and I am only transferring 1k or so, imagine transferring a few million and that being in limbo for 30 minutes or so.

I had the same issue, however I was able to make several smaller payments and it went fine thru their website. It may work for you as well. Mine was Toyota Financial. 
Say your total is 20k, but website only lets you do 5k max payment, you can probably do that several times to add to the 20k, it worked for me.

Satoshi is probably an alien from a another galaxy :-)

FYI, possessing/mining Bitcoin is illegal in Nepal, at least according with my developer there.

Even if btc goes to 10million I would still drive the same car I drive now. Tesla is the best car ever. Well I would upgrade to the P100D instead of my little Model S60.

I did, but paid too much :(

Excel? BUY BUY BUY!

Thanks this helps to explain things a bit. However still confused on the most efficient way to transferring bitcoins and how to come up with a good custom fee that will actually get processed.
I can't be the only person having a problem grasping the full picture?
edit: also I thought Segwit would have a much lower fee, but some far with Ledger at least that doesn't appear to be the case.

And what happens when governments decide that it threatens their power and pass regulation forbidding business to accept or deal with crypto-currencies? They would probably use the excuse that it is to prevent money laundering or terrorism or some other BS.

I tried to buy 1 BTC when it was 9300 but GDAX has been taking 5 days to get the money into my account, so that cost me easily 6K :(

Growing pains I guess, can't wait until it more instant. I should be able to buy and sell within minutes, so I can sell and buy quicker.

Had to link something :)
