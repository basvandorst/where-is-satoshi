So about $22,000 in solar to power one AntMiner S9?
23 cubic meter per antminer, is about 87 square feet x $250 is around $22,000.  At $350 around $30k.
I suspect the power is mostly used for the farming, and only a small portion is for the antminers?

You have pictures of your solar?
How much you spend on the panels/battery to be able to run one miner?

If you put $1 taped to your front window, the likely you would get robbed is low.  Now tape 1 million dollars to the front window, how likely do you think it will be that you would be robbed?

It's very hard for a big name company to get banned from the Apple store without pissing off Apple by doing something they don't like or plan on doing themselves.
