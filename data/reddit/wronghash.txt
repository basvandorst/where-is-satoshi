I have been using both. Initially I started using BLW because eclair couldn't  receive, but they updated it. Both are good IMHO.
Choosing a channel is better on BLW. But I like how Eclair set the time lock to two weeks and use android jobs to check every day, it make feel like I do not need to trust anyone else.
I can recommend both, and plan to keep using both.

When you put a 100$ note into the bank. Does the bank need to keep that particular note, and when you request, it need to give exactly the same note?
Or does the bank uses your money (lending for someone else) and when you request your money back, it pay you with other money?
Money is very different from a car.

Open a channel directly between the two, so you can keep that 1 satoshi fee.

Electrum take care of the change address, however, you still need to double check the change address when singing the transaction. If you have a virus on your computer, it could modify the unsigned transaction you created on the online computer, even if your seed didn't leak, if you sign a transaction that send your funds to the hacker, you can still lose funds.
I am developing an Android App for this exact situation, it will allow to confirm what is being sent to where, and if the change address really belongs to the public key set up on the app.

Not only that, by making it very fast and cheap to open and close channels inside the channel factory, it become very easy to realocate liquidity.
Sending capacity is limited by the amount you put. Receiving capacity is limited by the amount the other party puts. In channel factory there are multiple other parties, which means more nodes putting amounts you can receive without touching the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-03-24 04:42:52
Receiving Capacity
Channel factory will greatly improve this. If you have multiple nodes, each commiting some value, the receiving liquidity is much bigger.

Ok, so if you know the full node of merchant A and merchant B. You buy stuff from both at the same time, and use the same coin to pay both. Make sure the transaction that pays merchant A is send directly to him, so he accept immediately, same thing with merchant B. Both will accept the transaction (since it accepts as soon as it see it) and it should take a few seconds to them to notice the double spend, but since they accepted the payments right away, you already got the stuff.

In Bitcoin address is not like an account. It is just the conditions necessary to move those funds. When you make a transaction, you are really spending the output of a previous transaction, and you sign with the private key matching the address to prove that you own that output.
If you make a transaction to the same address, it will just be a normal transaction, only that the output happens to be the same conditions of the input.
One thing to keep in mind, it is recommended to not reuse address, because it make your transactions less private (since the coins have the same address, they must have the same owner). If you receive 3 transactions to the same address, when you spend those, you still have 3 inputs (not just one, which would mean a smaller tx), meaning that reusing address does not reduce fees (I used to think that, before I learned how transactions actually works).
@_date: 2019-02-10 02:08:23
I think he is doing this because of segwit. Segwit increased the block limit to about 4 MB (if we count the witness). With 300kB blocks, if we count the witness, the block size limit is back to about 1MB.
I understand his points, but even with lightning, we still need the first layer to open/close channels, and if we reduce now, we will have to increase it back later. Also, reducing the block size before linghting is ready would be really bad.

@_date: 2019-06-02 15:39:05
No, the fees will not be the same.
A transaction does not spend funds from addresses, it spend outputs from previous transactions (thats where the term UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Output comes from). The address just describe the conditions necessary to spend that coin.
So in your exemple, on the first case you have a tx with 2 inputs and 1 output. On the second case you have a tx with 5 inputs and 1 output. The first tx will be smaller which will lead to smaller fees.
By reusing addresses you are not saving on fees, you ate just compromising your privacy, since everyone knows all coins on the same address belongs to the same person, and if you transact with soneone you know, that person can know how much you have.
tl;dr: don't reuse addresses
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:57:33
What I said was just an exemple, but how do you determine what is publicy accessible? If it is sitting on someone's cold storage, does it count? What if it is sitting on an exchange waiting to be sold?
My point is, multiplying the last price by the supply, completely ignoring volume, is a metric very easy to manipulate, specially for low volume coins.

@_date: 2019-02-10 04:21:50
Bitcoin transactions works by spending outputs, not spending balance from accounts.
If, for example, you have the key for the address 3Example, and the second output of the transaction a0b0c0 is 0.1 BTC for that address, you have a coin, which is the UTXO (unspent transaction output) a0b0c0:2
If later the first output of transaction a1b1c1 outputs 0.001 BTC to that same address, now you have two coins:
a0b0c0:2 with 0.1 BTC
a1b1c1:1 with 0.001 BTC
and the total is 0.101 BTC.
But when you spend it, your transaction won't have the input 3Example. The input will be a0b0c0:2 or a1b1c1:1 (or both), and the transaction will be signed with the key matching 3Example.
@_date: 2019-02-12 02:02:33
You need the first layer to open/close channels. The first time someone is receiving bitcoin, he/she will need an on chain transaction to open the channel. If that person later receive more than the channel capacity, he/she will need another on chain transaction.
The idea is to minimize on chain transactions, but they are still necessary.

Dominance is not a very good metric, there are ways to cheat the marketcap. For example:
Create your own shitcoin, with 1 billion coins, and of course you own them all.
Get it listed on some crap exchanges (some of them just require you to pay and they will list any scam)
Buy 1 coin from yourself for $1
Now since the last trade was $1, and there are a billion coins, your marketcap is a billion dolars. Now just put some to sell on those exchanges, there will be people stupid enough to buy some.

The problem with paper wallet is that it encorage address reuse, and when you withdraw, you withdraw all your balance to a hot wallet (you can immediately create another paper wallet, but it is still going thru a hot wallet).
Also paper wallets are harder to create, in a safe way, than to use a hardware wallet. Sure, if you do everything right, it is safe, but for non technical users there is a high chance to make mistakes that can cost a lot. For non technical users hardware wallets are the best solution.

Also, breaking the password may take some time (weeks, maybe) depending on the strength of the password. If you have a backup ot the seed in multiple places, That could provide you a chance to move the funds to a new seed before the password is cracked.

@_date: 2019-12-20 14:48:43
They can only log the information they get.
Nodes only know the previous and the next node in the transaction route, they don't know the full path.
To determine who pay who, you need to force every single node in the path to log and disclose what they know. It only take one node to refuse to disclose to prevent finding out who paid who.
A payment can go thru nodes from multiple countries, good luck trying to enforce kyc.

I assume now they are promising to remove it by the end of 2019.
Until they remove the coordinator it is a centralized coin. And I don't think they will ever remove the coordinator, because it rely on low processing devices to do the PoW, and only while doing transactions. Clearly will be very easy to double spend if they ever remove the coordinator.

Exchanges depend on people buying shitcoins, specially those without fiat pairs (no, USDT does not count). They want bitcoin to be slow and have high fees, to trick people into looking for the "next bitcoin" and buying a ton of shitcoins.
Also note that Binance withdraw fees they charge is much higher than the actual fees they pay on chain (even if you consider multiple transactions to add / remove from cold storage). That means they profit from withdraws, higher on chain fees means they can get away with even higher withdraw fees.
CZ in the past have suggested that people should store their funds on "safe exchanges", funny enough his exchange was hacked this year. Higher fees discourage people from withdrawing.
Other than that, I can't understand why supporting more shitcoins is higher priority than good support for Bitcoin.
Don't buy shitcoins, but if you do, at least use a decent exchange, one that support segwit.

Since the blocks will be taking twice as long to be mined, transaction fees should go up, increading the profitability.
Also by doubling the time between blocks, the inflation will be reduced by half, just like an out of season halving, which would also pressure the price up.
Another factor: when a country like China try everything they can to ban bitcoin and fail miserably, it should be yet another display of resilience.

When Bitcoin was created, Satoshi did not started with 21 million bitcoins. Before the first block was mined, there were 0 Bitcoins, for the first 210K blocks, each new block mined created 50 BTC. Each 210K block, the amount of Bitcoin created on each block halves - that event is what we call the halving.
The limited number of coins comes from the fact that, since every 210k blocks the amount of Bitcoin created each block halves, and the minimum divisible amount Bitcoin is one satoshi, that is 0.00000001 BTC, after a little more than 100 years, the reward will be 0, and no more Bitcoins will be created. When that happen, the total supply will be a little below 21 million Bitcoins.
About the impact in price, on the previous two halvings, it caused the price to go up a lot because it reduces the inflation. But keep in mind that what happend on the past may not happen in the future, so we will have to wait and see what happens next time =)
