Man, You have to be really dedicated to your porn to buy it in physical media. I mean if I burnt all my porn onto disc and put it in a jewel case, I'd have to build an addition to my house just to have somewhere to keep it.

A drop in the bucket, yes. But it does have potential as a meta-currency used to exchange currencies across borders.

to be declared fiat from an organization with the power to enforce it's value, the legitamacy to ease public fears about the currency's security, and a large enough sphere of influence to ensure a critical number of transactions.

IMHO, and I am just some silly guy with Google and an opinion, Given that the current foreign exchange market [FX market] is huge but flawed, I think cryptocurrency has the potential to replace that market completely...  I mean the FX market worked great in that period after Breton Woods gave way to floating currency, mainly because the US, Europe and Japan were able to be dominate enough to back the exchanges. And companies like EBS and Reuters were able to operate without fear of lack of oversight, because all the big economic players were sitting at the same table. Now that we have the Eurozone, and a lot more currency exchanges are happening outside of the US, Eurozone and Japan than in the 90s, the question of sovereignty is going to become much more prevalent with each year. This, in combination with the lower cost of bitming versus currency speculation, is going to continue fueling bitcoins for some time to come. It may be only doing a couple billion now... but in 10 years... who knows? That being said, this comment doesn’t contradict my previous opinion that bitcoin will not gain any domestic foothold, unless it’s exchange is highly regulated and given oversight by the domestic power’s that be.
