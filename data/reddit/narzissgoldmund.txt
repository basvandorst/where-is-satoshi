Very good advice. I bought myself a Trezor as well last month and couldn't be happier! I was getting more and more nervous every time I logged into my previous wallet, having the thought that maybe all my funds somehow got transferred through a hack. Even though I trust my computer skills, I was not completely feeling 100 percent sure that my funds where completely safe.
That anxious feeling is now completely gone with my funds safely stored on the trezor! The only remaining nagging thing is that my seed words are still not 100% securely stored. I know that no-one will ever find them at the current place, but I'm still going for a vault at the bank soon for even more peace of mind.

Some assumptions can be made, but there is no way of telling for real.
I was actually thinking of this exact point yesterday. I'm in the game since 2012 and I actually have moved my coins around quite a bit over these years. I think it is quite normal that if you keep access to your coins and you see the value of your coins increasing you pro-actively move them around to new addresses with better means of security, since the old way of storing could be compromised somehow.
Of course there are people putting them directly onto a paper wallet and never touched them in 6 years, but somehow I believe this is not the majority. So you can assume that if coins have never moved over the last 6 years, there is a decent change that they are lost (not all of them of course!).

I think blockchain.info stores so much bitcoins that if it goes down with a scandal where all coins are lost, it's over with bitcoin.
