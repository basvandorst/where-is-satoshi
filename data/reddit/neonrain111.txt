Just like it was a coincidence that binance got “hacked” just before the pump started.

I own a tattoo shop in the Netherlands and  i started accepting Bitcoin this week also haha.

I send a bitcoin and some ripple coins to my ledger sunday and i had both within minutes. 
This was from litebit (a dutch crypto site) to my ledger with normal fees. 
I dont know what the norm is but i was suprised by the speed.

1% also owns the worlds riches in Fiat money so no difference there i think.
Wether its exchanges or persons every bitcoin sold and every new buyer helps it grow and become more succesfull. 
And also many empty or negative bank accounts around the world.
Its just how it is, it doesn't change the positive side of not needing/paying a bank in the future if bitcoin keeps it momentum.

Criminals are cashing in on Fiat cash money for illegal activity on the streets every day.

You do know that if your in vet and bitcoin drops you still lose that excact value right?
Btc price still controls every alt price, and 90% of the time when btc drops the slt also drops so you dollar value drops double as hard.
Being in vet is not a hedge like tether etc. 
Pardon my english, not my first language.

Litebit, weird thing is that i made two smaller buy's earlier that week that went through without a problem. 
They stopped a larger amount and it ended up costing me 400€ more to buy it later that day. 
I cancelled my account with them today partly because of this.

Same here with Litebit, when the price drops they have no bitcoins for sale al of a sudden. And if it go's up they go offline.
