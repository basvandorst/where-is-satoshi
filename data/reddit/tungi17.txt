buy on uphold - get a TREZOR to hold
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:15:00
i would compare it to HSBC (all outlets , all ATM, all server farms,...) or any bank and u know btc and crypto electricity usage is a drop in the pond
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:11:34

just wait until they ban Bitcoin (again) and go full centralised , Communist Party Coin only (which will fit nicely into the Social Point System and their 100% surveillance state)
@_date: 2019-11-18 05:45:02
go to solid OTC exchange and no probs
@_date: 2019-08-17 03:49:56
hardware wallets ? - no not true + “platforms not taking them anymore...” has nothing to do with HW wallets , you use them to secure your coins, do not trust exchanges or 3rd parties - you need to hold your coins / keys to be in full control
