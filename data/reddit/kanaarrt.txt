Part of Bitcoin's value comes from the energy burned to secure the blockchain. When 80% of that energy burn stops securing Bitcoin, it will certainly not be worth more.

This just seems completely backwards to me. I think you have that reversed. This is some insane double-think right here... If you spend some time on r/btc you will learn that they are all about bitcoin-as-digital-cash. Saying otherwise is just blatant misinformation.
[Edit] Actually it's not fair to even to say that r/bitcoin wants bitcoin-as-payment-network. I'm pretty sure from my observations that both sides want bitcoin-as-digital-cash. But the censorship and social engineering has created a mirage that one side wants something different than the other. In fact we both want the same thing.

Because there already is a coin with a flexible block size, it's actually been in the top 10 for a long time, and if Bitcoin doesn't scale soon this other coin will end up eating Bitcoin's lunch. Bitcoin has a massive network effect, it would be a shame to lose it because it can't process as many transactions as some altcoins.

Just because some people perceive Venmo as a threat to Bitcoin does not mean they want Bitcoin to become more like Venmo or PayPal. Where did you get that notion?
