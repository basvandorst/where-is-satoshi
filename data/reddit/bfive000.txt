Not necessarily, more of a person who came into some funds and needs assistance

An option where timely verification processes and limits is not ideal

Not necessarily, let's say for example i want to buy $100,000 of btc, tonight, everything is legit and am prepared to verify anything my bank would need. There are options to buy amounts up to 50k, but lengthy verification and other issues arise

Thanks, it means i appreciate it but let me worry about the danger, and that is why im asking about a proper way to go about it in the first place
@_date: 2019-10-10 21:30:23
Well pretty much all of these comments are unrelated and useless, reminds me of any time i post n all i get is a bunch of dumb asses expressing their irrelevant opinions n dancing around the question/statement. I like the idea of keeping the comments relative to the post so if thats what we gna do then lets do it to the maximum
