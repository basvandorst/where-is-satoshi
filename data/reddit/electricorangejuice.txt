I'm still not sure I understand. I just tried a transaction of $11 to a different recipient address (Coinbase this time), and the fees are still $3.7. Are you saying that my breadwallet wallet counts as multiple sender addresses for some reason?

Not as far as I'm aware.

Just went ahead with the transaction in spite of the fees. You can see it here:

I didn't go through with the transaction because of those fees, so I don't have a link.
However, I have an account with Genesis mining and receive a tiny amount of btc every day. I probably have received upwards of 100 transactions now in that particular wallet. Could that be the root of the issue?

"Gold isn't real wealth. The US government is real wealth"
then goes on to list the valuables that are contained within the government: 
- Taxes
- Labour
- Ideas
- Land
- **Resources**
I think this guy needs to reevaluate his argument. Something's not lining up quite right.

Genesis is sending it all to one single address so that wouldn't be the issue then. hmm...

I agree with almost all of your points, because for everyday use bitcoin is impractical. For now, you should really think of bitcoin as something in-between a regular currency and an investment asset like gold or silver. Sure you *can* pay for goods and services in some places using Bitcoin, but chances are that it costs more and takes longer for day-to-day stuff like ordering a pizza.
Most people that have bitcoin use it for one of the following:
a) Short-term speculation. The price fluctuates a lot, so you can make (or lose) a lot of quick cash by playing the market. 
b) Long-term value-store. It's a lot like gold in that it's something you can invest in, in small increments — Like x percent of your paycheck each month, and it will (Hopefully) keep it's value while your regular paper money slowly depreciates over time. Bitcoin, of course, has a couple of benefits over gold in that it's easier to acquire, easier to store and move around and easier to cash out if you need some paper money down the road. It also has the potential for significant appreciation as usage picks up.
Now, I'm speaking from a western perspective. If you live in, let's say, Venezuela or India, I could see paying a little extra in fees being a worthy trade-off, in order to keep your assets safe from corrupt government intervention.

True, but $1000 was never really that strong resistance on way up. We kind of breezed through it in a single day. Loosing $980 and then $920 would worry me more.
*Edit 6 min later: There goes $920 :D*

The thing that really impresses me, is that this is happening while the US Dollar is at a 13 year high.
