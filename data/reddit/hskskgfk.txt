Domestic electricity is subsidised by taxpayer money. Her organic fruits most certainly are not. She is free to pay full price for a proper 3 phase commercial line for multiple refrigerators. Noone is stopping her.
Commercial use is also heavier, so she poses a fire hazard to her neighbours by drawing that much power from a 220V single phase line.

Yep something like that, you'll have to bypass the tripper if you want to draw more

Yes I agree - I am pretty sure there's a lot of ill-gotten wealth parked in Bitcoin. That is mostly the reason the Indian government wants to regulate it, electricity consumption is hardly an issue. Not sure why this sub thinks this way lol

More than tax avoidance it is for black money issues - a lot of the Bitcoin trade in India is from people looking to park their black money / illegal wealth somewhere.

Don't know about China but in India electricity prices have tiers - for example domestic use electricity is cheap, but commercial and industrial connections are costlier. And yes, it is possible to know if you're abusing the "cheap" connection. I know a person on my street who was busted for abusing her cheap domestic connection for business use by the relative usage metric mentioned in an earlier comment - she had an organic fruits business and was running multiple refrigerators in her house.
  
I'm guessing the same would happen if you use all that domestic electricity to mine Bitcoin rather than store fruit.

India has a limit on cash too, but it's quite high - USD 5000. There is no withdrawal limit on ATMs though
