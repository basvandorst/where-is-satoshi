Mind explains how Bitcoin is deflationary when the only process that creates Bitcoin is mining, however once the cap is reached on the amount created (21 million I believe), how will the system remain stable? Since mining processes the transactions, it can’t continue unless people mine, which means more Bitcoin gets created, leading to inflation and loss of value.

We do not have the money to continue spending as much as we are. There are currently roughly 201 million Americans between the age of 18 and 64 meaning we would end up spending roughly $200 BILLION PER MONTH giving people money as basic income. That’s fucking 2.4 TRILLION A YEAR. Here’s an interesting thought, where does that money come from? More fucking debt? Printing it? (wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the answer they give) The concept of UBI seems awesome in theory, but how will prices react? If they print the money, people have more money to spend and as demand increases, so will prices. Inflation occurs, we freak out and with a liberal shithead (not all liberals are shitheads, but Yang fucking is) like Yang in the office, he will likely resort to price controls to prevent inflation from his terrible idea AND PRICE CONTROLS DO NOT WORK WHATSOEVER. If the gov takes on more debt, especially 2.4 TRILLION EVERY YEAR, we are fucked plain and simple.
We are in so much debt atm and unless we cut spending and raise taxes to bring down our debt (our interest payments alone are greater than our annual spending), the US will eventually collapse, and it could be a whole lot sooner than people imagine. Fuck Andrew Yang. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:06:58
That doesn’t solve the problem at all. Our entire currency depends on the US dollar and considering how many people don’t trust Bitcoin, do you really think it would be considered EVER as a currency for us? Also how many people lost loads of money off Bitcoin’s value collapsing last year? Don’t you think maybe Bitcoin isn’t impervious to the same problem? 
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:13:42
Of course the government doesn’t like the idea of a currency they can’t control, if we were to head into recession with a majority of people holding Bitcoin, we would be completely unable to utilize monetary policy changes in order to pull ourselves out. Not to mention it puts the Government under the creators of Bitcoin which I would fucking hate.
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:00:34
Right, and how much will that actually be? One major goal for Bitcoin has been trying to bring down transaction fees for it to be viable as a transaction platform. Well, even if the transaction fees aren’t that great, at least they are still profiting, right? I highly doubt it. When you consider energy costs, GPU and other parts depreciating among other costs, I doubt many will be making a profit unless a large corporation is able to secure massive amounts of GPUs to get better prices and locate their businesses in prime areas (such as Venezuela where electricity is super cheap), then you might be able to profit consistently. However I’m still highly doubtful that Bitcoin will take off as an actual currency or that it would be supported by large corporations or government. It’s deflationary nature discourages spending which greatly impacts the overall economy.  
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:15:58
I’m sorry, what? If Bitcoin were used as an ACTUAL currency, nobody would be getting rich. The point of a currency (among others) is to act as a store of value, which Bitcoin is not doing. If you are getting rich off buying Bitcoin, where does that money come from? It comes from other people obviously, it’s not just created, so for others, Bitcoin would have acted as a terrible store of value according to your explanation. Can you also elaborate a bit on how the majority of people are brainwashed and stupid? I’d love to know how I’m thinking irrationally ��
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:45:17
If Bitcoin became the currency of the world, it would absolutely have to be monitored and regulated by the government. Given the MASSIVE spike in 2017, it shows that Bitcoin can be highly manipulated. If corporations began using Bitcoin for accounting, imagine how greatly their numbers could be skewed by price fluctuations. There are loads of flaws that present themselves, and honestly, there is nothing wrong with the US dollar besides the fact that it will always lose value (as will Bitcoin if mining continues) 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:23:39
Care to summarize how I’m wrong? 
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:10:24
That’s a huge claim you’re making, why would Bitcoin of all currencies be the last currency to remain when there is really no intrinsic value and wide swings in price? Also I don’t think you understand how monetary policy works... we don’t print money in the US, we create money through loans as a result of a fractional reserve system. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:23:05
Oh wow, you're absolutely right, Warren has bought a shit ton of silver. I stand corrected. 
Regardless, I just don't see Bitcoin's intrinsic worth and how to quantify it. I've heard theories, but I haven't gotten a definite answer as to why Bitcoin is going to grow in value logically. With a stock, you can determine their future value and therefore their present value based on the rate at which they grow their operations and when they pay out to shareholders. You can't do that with Bitcoin as it doesn't produce anything, it only circulates around the world through transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:40:10
Can you explain the fundamentals?
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:49:46
I agree that Bitcoin's strength is the freedom it gives to its users when using it, however you can't exactly put a price on that freedom to determine an intrinsic value. If it were a stable currency, I don't see why the price would move around much at all as people wouldn't be exchanging it for another currency, just using it to purchase goods which wouldn't impact the price of the currency itself.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:36:45
Okay so first of all, usury is not investing or at all what I'm talking about. While investing could be considered loaning debt through bonds, the interest rates are determined by the party taking the loan. Usury is first of all illegal and also charging extremely high interest, neither are going on today with bonds which are a legal market and interest rates being so low.
Second of all, what are you talking about in the first part? Like seriously I can't tell if you're trolling or not at this point. Something that is productive must produce something. Wealth, if invested, is producing MORE WEALTH, therefore it is productive. The premium being charged (again, in the case of bonds which is not what I was talking about with equity/stocks) is first of all to cover the loss of purchasing power due to inflation. If you give someone a loan with the chance that they won't pay it back, of course you're going to demand a return. But just a return that is high enough to cover for the loss of purchasing power due to inflation is the bare minimum, is it not? Money is simply the tangible good created from work (not created, but it has the same meaning in this context) and people trade that tangible good which represents their work to each other. Money IS productive because it allows companies to grow, governments to function, etc. If wealth wasn't productive, how the hell would the US government still be functioning and how would people retire off passive income such as from bonds, dividends, real estate, etc if wealth wasn't productive? 
I really don't mean to be rude, I truly don't, it just feels like you're either trolling me at this point or you don't understand the idea of wealth and how it is productive. To say wealth shouldn't be productive is one thing (which I would disagree with you on), but to say simply that it isn't productive at all is just plain false and absolutely ridiculous to claim.

@_date: 2019-06-28 02:52:34
I don't know what you're talking about, Buffett doesn't trade at all, he invests. There's a big difference. He does not buy any commodities at all, perhaps a business of his purchases silver although I'm not sure which one of his would, but he does not himself. Bitcoin isn't an investment and is not what he would buy.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:35:15
I'm sorry, what? Passive income is what separates the rich from the poor. It's not a matter of what is normalized by our society, it's a matter of what has historically provided returns on capital invested. Wealth on its own isn't productive, that's right, but when invested in liquid assets such as stocks it is productive.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:43:35
That's correct, and I agree with him on that. Buffett likes buying assets which are net cash flow positive, as in they generate cash flows passively. Bitcoin is not an investment that is productive by any means, it does not generate anything. Buffett also probably does not fully understand blockchain and crypto at all which makes his stance more understandable, but I still agree with him even with me understanding how crypto and blockchain function. I just don't see what Bitcoin's intrinsic worth is as it does not provide any future cash flows and there is no underlying asset to base it's worth off of. The only cost to consider when calculating its intrinsic worth is the electricity cost to generate one, however that electricity cannot be redeemed or recreated, therefore it seems like it only destroys intrinsic value. I would love to be wrong :0
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:07:50
I think you’re severely misinformed here. Real money is completely subjective, USD is real money. It may be fiat and be losing value over time, but it’s real. Money with hard value like gold serves as a store of value which I don’t think you misunderstand that point, but the problem is that Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value like gold. The reason gold has intrinsic value is because it is rare, it can only be found by searching and mining which costs large amounts of money. Bitcoin’s cost associated with creating it is simply electricity costs and costs from buying the equipment needed which ranges GREATLY across the world. Due to those fluctuations and due to Bitcoin being used as an investment vehicle and not an actual currency, Bitcoin is not the same.
@_date: 2019-04-15 22:17:46
That is not intrinsic value, that is a perk of using the system. You can easily purchase something with a credit card or debit card without anyone's approval, except if you're using a credit card then you do need someone else's approval... because it's their money, not yours. I also never said that Bitcoin costs more to mine than gold... like anywhere in my comment I'm not sure where you got that. Also you have yet to give me an intrinsic value for Bitcoin that is HARD value. Part of intrinsic value for something like gold is that not only do people consider it valuable (thus it has value), but it PRESERVES that value. When you mine gold, it costs money to mine it, however once you have it, you know it will not depreciate in value and that the value will be stored. When you mine Bitcoin, it does not matter how much it costs to mine (I realize there is an entire network of microeconomics at play that would impact the price, but let's ignore that for now), the only value it has is what the market is quoting it at. If you can pinpoint a value on Bitcoin like you can with companies or physical currencies, give it to me.
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:14:32
Ugh this is so ignorant it’s unbelievable. You’re talking about Bitcoin as though it’s a business and that’s it’s going to crush everything else and as a result have greater value. Cool, but if everyone uses it to make money and few people actually use it as a currency, what’s the point? Holding currencies is a dumb idea in all honesty, if you make money consider yourself lucky. There is nothing changing about the currency nor is there any true value. Put your money in stocks if you want it to grow, those are actual assets which are growing in value due to the businesses themselves growing.
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:29:18
I don't think the volatility is due to natural ebbs and flows as much as it is due to an extremely volatile currency which has lots of emotional investors involved. When I said "you don't see people buying US dollars only to hold onto them for years hoping they will rise in price..." I meant in proportion to the amount of people actually using the currency to buy other goods and use it as an actual currency. People treat Bitcoin as an investment (this whole subreddit is a perfect example) which is not its intent. I realize that energy consumption has nothing to do with the amount of users or transactions, but the fact that there is already this much energy being consumed by the currency is unbelievable and I think it may give governments an excuse to regulate/shut it down. 
Also, if it is inevitable that the profit margin will eventually reach zero, then who would be mining bitcoins at a massive loss? And if nobody is mining Bitcoins, how will the system function since the energy consumed by miners is used to process transactions on the network?

@_date: 2018-11-25 17:51:03
Yeah, that's how long term price is determined. Technical analysis with Bitcoin is completely speculative and based on past trends and clearly has not worked. What this subreddit is doing is simply gambling their money, it is not an investment, and the odds are stacked greatly against you. Want to be obstinate and lose your money? That's fine. I know how it feels to pick bad investments and not want to sell, I've been trading stocks for years. But if you can pick a better asset to purchase which first of all is productive, and you can pick an asset that will continue you grow your portfolio and succeed as a hedge against inflation, that will be best.

@_date: 2018-11-25 18:58:50
Bitcoin is currently undergoing a phase of correction. The price is still stabilizing, and once it does, then it will hopefully be adopted as a currency. A currency does not have massive swings, a currency stays stable. I believe that Bitcoin will drop to 1k roughly although it will probably be even less, and will then stabilize and retain its value. In the future if changes are made in transaction fees, regulation/taxes, supply, inflation, etc, then the value may go up, but we should never see the explosion in value that occurred last year. That is not a healthy currency, that is a bubble, and it will come falling right back down. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:17:49
Okay, I am not going to listen to all of his videos since I do not have the time for that, but I watched a few regarding his outlook on Bitcoin's future and his success and I think it's hilarious. On stage, Andreas argued for why Bitcoin won't go to zero by bringing up the fact that you can still buy the roman Sesterces and the Athenian Drachmae (excuse my spelling). What he doesn't mention is the fact that those currencies are both worth LESS THAN A DOLLAR. When describing his reasoning for deciding whether to buy or sell, he was talking like a gambler at a blackjack table! "Maybe if I keep going It'll reach 10k and I'll make money." Please send me a link to a video you want me to see and I'll check it out.

Either you’re spreading lies or you’ve been listening to fake news. Warren has not done anything of the sort. You’d know by his statements on Bitcoin that he views it as a completely failure in the future and that he has publicly said he will never invest in Bitcoin. Warren is a logical man who invests in tangible, productive assets that actually generate and retain value which will earn him money over time. Bitcoin is a currency which is destined to fail.

Bitcoin’s value is completely based off how the market values it. There is no asset you can reclaim, there is no underlying business generating growth and revenue, it is a non-productive asset. There is just some code saying you have Bitcoin in your wallet and the market says what it is worth. Regardless of circulation and restriction of supply, you are not inherently changing the value of what buyers believe it to be worth.  You’re making the assumption that the market cap will remain constant due to a fixed valuation, and the reality is that there is no set value. The fact that users have the ability to essentially pump and dump Bitcoin is outrageous and is completely illegal in real markets for a good reason. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:56:42
Well that's the problem, there are FAR more people considering and treating it as a speculative asset than people who use it. 
Also, consider the government. If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, the government will need to monitor it to prevent tax fraud and such. Considering it is extremely difficult to do so, there is a high chance that there will be legal action surrounding Bitcoin in the future. Also, consider the amount of energy that miners use to process transactions? In one year, the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin is the same as roughly 100,000 American homes per year! There will be significant issues there as well, swaying government sentiment to take action.
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:51:08
What makes you say that? 
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:49:53
Bitcoin is also incredibly volatile and has destroyed billions of dollars of value. How can you say it's a great retirement fund when there is no promised future? Currencies should not be going through massive swings of 10% in one day. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 07:30:31
If a business fails and you are an investor, you can try to salvage what is left by selling off its assets to minimize losses. Point is, there is something that actually backs up your money and its growth. With Bitcoin, there is no such thing aside from the prospect of Bitcoin being the future currency of the world. Other than that, it is worthless. The only value it has technically is the electricity cost of generating it, which Bitcoin has sufficiently destroyed over the years with its decrease in value, and that cost of electricity will only increase. If the cost continues to increase, that does not ensure an increase in price. If you invest in a productive asset, and that business increases the value of its assets, that growth is not subject to immediate change unlike mining difficulty or the value of Bitcoin. 
A currency should not be worth what Bitcoin is currently worth, and the problem I have with Bitcoin is that it is intended on being a currency, however people treat it as an asset. The arguments brought up for why Bitcoin will increase in price due to its efficiency as a currency makes a fantastic case for why it will be a good currency, but not a good investment. When you see more people using the dollar, you don't see millions of people jumping on the dollar. If you want to buy Bitcoin to USE it, that's a different story, but I still would suggest that you buy later so that you can use it when it falls further to minimize losses.
