Can you explain why, not trying to be argumentative, just curious about your statement.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:03:31
Yea seems undeniable, what am I missing?
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:19:59
That is true but it doesn't mean that the technology isn't important. If you have something like IOTA which can remove transaction costs and improve speeds while seemingly fix the scaling issue, then BitCoin will have to play catch up..

Stable? Last week it moved 30%, I'm not sure if that is stable. Just because price is where it is a week ago doesn't mean its stable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:14:23
That chart is sort of weird though because the sometimes it shows a drop over 5 days, other times drop over 5 months.  How would a 90% drop not indicate a bubble like the previous bitcoin bubbles?  
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:57:33
Many asset classes go through bubbles, check out the book Irrational Exuberance, it gives nearly a hundred examples of different types of bubbles. Can I say they are exactly like bitcoin, no, but certainly many ups and downs.
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:43:52
Yeah.. but cash works. Choose USD or Colombian pesos if you're in Venezuela.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:09:57
I don't think it would correct itself very efficiently. There is so much uncertainty surrounding this that large moves could cause panic selling. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:59:32
Using modeling is how you prove if a theory is correct, or else it’s just speculation, that’s the issue.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:03:53
Austrian economics is pretty much a joke in mainstream economic theory. Outside of a few things from Hayek it's not taken very seriously. The reason for this is because they don't use modeling to test any of their theories like other economic schools of thought. They also hold in my opinion, a religious like absolutist stance on economics that is overly simplistic especially when it comes to currency and gold standard. 
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:33:53
What kind of analogy this? You don't want to invest in bitcoin because you think the price will drop when governments regulate it? BUT YOU SMOKED WEED A FEW YEARS AGO
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:03:29
Apparently nobody understands how inflation works. Argentina is going through hyperinflation at over 50%. You know what else is at an all time high in Argentina besides bitcoin? EVERYTHING. Bread, rent, consumer staples, transportation. It all evens out. You make 10x in bitcoin and pay 10x in rent.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:41:38
Because they aren't?
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:10:33
Also is capacity usage? Because that seems underwhelming if not
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:28:42
Here? On r/bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:26:18
Yeah a safe haven, like when it went from 20k to 4K. Cash was actually the best performing asset class of 2018
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:23:18
If its anything like the dot-com bubble you wouldn't to be in at this point, we'd be just past the peak.
Likewise, I don't think think its fair to say all bubbles typically last 3-4 years. The bitcoin bubble in 13/14 really only lasted 6 months.

This drives me nuts, this is what libertarian and gold bugs have always said but its so ignorant of actual economics. Its called INFLATION, and with inflation comes rises in wages. Yes the dollar loses value every year but you also don't make $0.25 an hour like you did in 1913 when the Fed was created.
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:15:09
Meh, there are only like 80 bakkt contracts and they don't seem to be pushing prices down.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:18:07
As long as you don't need the cash, it'll be illiquid for a good few years.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:35:24
Probably to turn it into USD
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:49:00
You aren't investing, you are speculating. If all your money is in bitcoin you need to diversify now. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:49:59
this would have been funny if the grammar wasn't retarded. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:46:35
hahahah. Right because the USD has 20% swings in a day? Its super stable and can be turned into any other asset immediately. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:56:54
I buy cryptos, but not because they are safer than fiat. Quite the opposite, they are risky so their reward is higher. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:29:45
Bitcoin isn't dead just overvalued and in a bubble. Just like Microsoft had value during dot com bubble. Sold at $2700 will rebuy at $1200.

Cryptocurrencies have way too many unknowns to be considered an investment. Complete lack of real regulation, massive governmental regulatory unknowns in the future, wild repeating speculative bubbles, constant emerging alternatives. There are not enough quantifiable fundamentals to call it an investment, its extremely speculative and would be considered trading more than an investment in any traditional financial sense. Doesn't mean you can't make money from it though. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:23:24
I see this posted from time to time and its flawed logic. With printing more money comes inflation, and wages are part of inflation. Clearly we don't make $1 per hour anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:22:49
going to take longer than 2 weeks, could take a few months.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:23:48
Nobody can predict future stock prices, but there are models that can confirm whether something is overvalued and in a bubble. This is a bubble and just like the 13/14 bubble I expect prices to return to their pre-bubble levels but possibly slightly higher. Set a remind me for 6 months I'll happily bet you $50 ETH that bitcoin drops below $1500 within that time frame.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:03:05
You're options aren't mutually exclusive. I'm in it for both short term and long term gains because I believe in the technology as well as recognize this insane speculative bubble.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:59:31
I’m done with this conversation after this comment, too much misinformation to dispel. People working 9-5 absolutely benefitted. QE liquidity is what allowed businesses to expand   and the unemployment rate go from 15% to 4%. The banks also loan to regular folks buying houses at historically low rates, and if you have any half decent career you have a 401k which is literally free money from your company. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:10:32
I see, I disagree though which is fine, we can disagree. It’s my opinion that the economy will keep growing long term , so I’m working from that assumption which I see as extremely mainstream.
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:49:12
I like it, much more stable than crypto
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:46:20
People don’t receive the money? What are you talking about? I understand QE, that money is given to banks who lend it out to businesses, that’s the entire point is to increase liquidity.
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:16:04
Because technology increases productivity, so we are harvesting their productivity rather than human productivity.
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:23:46
Banks don’t print money, don’t know why you keep saying that, the Fed does. So mining bitcoin out of thin air is different from printing money how? 
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:59:51
How is bitcoin not deflationary with a fixed money supply? In economic monetary policy terms that’s how deflation is defined (or shrinking money supply)
@_date: 2019-05-04 06:38:30
Because I consider it more of an investment vehicle/ store or value than than currency. Doesn’t mean you can’t purchase items with it, but there are some negatives to something that naturally gains value as a currency (deflationary trends). If we only had a deflationary currency and not stable fiat, business couldn’t operate, which is one of the main reasons why the world got rid of the gold standard.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:09:54
I understand margin trading thanks. I just don't trust the exchanges the same way I trust a broker. The fee structure, the way its set up peer to peer with lower liquidity, etc. I'd rather just sell high and buy low.

My mortgage was 3.5% not 20%, and the Fed had little to do with the subprime mortgage crisis  of selling derivatives. The only thing is m common is the word “house”
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:39:38
Printed money? inflation has been at historical lows besides the fact that Paul and Schiff have been calling for hyperinflation for over a decade, never happened. Look at dow jones chart below how can you say not a good run?!
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:21:05
If you are going to give them shit for for a small correction then you have to give them credit for everything else. 2010 - 2017 was an awesome run for stocks 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:39:06
You should have just posted a picture of the 2013/2014 bubble
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:59:43
Then maybe it should be 1000 people buying 1 coin
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:47:16
There is plenty of evidence that hyper deflation is a currency is bad. It’s the opposite problem of Venezuela. Rather than prices rising quickly they fall quickly meaning business margins are wiped out by the time they make it to the consumer.
Look at the Long Depression in US history 
You can also lead about deflationary spiral 
Small amounts of deflation are okay, places like Singapore do this, but nothing at the level like bitcoin. The supply of money has to be roughly equal to economic growth to prevent inflation or deflation which is near impossible without central planning. That doesn’t mean central planning is always good ie. Venezuela.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:23:15
You mean the same Ron Paul who has correctly predicted the last 28 of 2 recessions? As well as the hyperinflation that never happened? His track record is abysmal  for understanding market conditions 
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:56:53
It's not easy to short bitcoin in practical terms, you have essentially borrow money in a margin account. I am bearish though, think this is a bubble  like 2014, waiting until all the alt coins return to their pre-March levels.
