Hm, I suppose you could roll a custom client that restricts to the given nodes, but at that point I don't think you're part of the Lightning network anymore, and are just using payment channels with off-chain state (which might be ok for their use case). ��‍♂️

If they want to receive a Lightning transaction, they have to be online. Think of it this way, more and more service providers will now have multiple Lightning channels open - perhaps 10s or 1000s. 
Your wallet will have a few, or a few dozen channels open as well, each one funded by some mBTC. When you have to pay, you just scan the code for the invoice, and your channel balance is instantly updated. Balance running low? Top up using your favorite exchange, which will send a transaction through its channels to your Lightning node.
It's conceivable that you never close your channels. I'm not entirely sure how the nodes handle temporary offline states, but I'm guessing some sort of resilience for that can be (are?) built in.

Worth adding that settlements will just show a commitment transaction with the LN you've opened a channel with, it won't show any of the intermediate transactions you've made. Those disappear into the ~~ether~~ bithaze. 
Your on-chain transactions and thus possibly your addresses and balances might be visible, though. Schnorr sigs should help with that.

Depends on what your definition of gg is. 
The Internet is attacked ceaselessly, by attackers from around the world who are smart, motivated and well funded. Still, you're able to post/view your ~~cat~~ Lambo memes without a problem :)

Can we sticky this? Or perhaps a Lightning FAQ?

Problems are good. Problems make the chain [antifragile](

Very cool, excited about the emerging new ways of monetizing on the blockchain, while strengthening it at the same time.

I don't think that matters. If you're a LN node, you have to route payments from unknown nodes, or you're not a participant. Once a channel is open, it's impossible to know who you're transacting with (unless you're the sender or recipient). This is by design.
Doesn't mean they have to participate in LN, though, they can set up their own payment channels with other exchanges/their users if they want.

"Good game" :) 
Comes from video games, where you say that at the end of a match.

What's a watchtower? Also, how would one go about earning fees for routing payments, is there somewhere I could read up about this? Thanks!

Thank you for doing this �� I'm willing to bet we're witnessing history in the making, but it'll only be apparent about 4-5 years from now.

Please, please, please continue posting regularly! More ELI5-type detailed breakdowns of individual bits of the technology would be appreciated too :)

Yeah, it's pretty spectacular. The crypto revolution makes a lot of sense through the decentralized, bottom-up, stochastic lens that Taleb advocates. Required reading for crypto fanatics, imo.
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:33:46
That was one of the better responses I've seen on this issue, regardless of which side you fall on. Kudos!

Good article. For anybody seeking to get a grasp of where the world is headed, I can't recommend Nassim Taleb's _Antifragile_ enough.
