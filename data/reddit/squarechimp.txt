Is it also possible something is an unstable store if value?
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:48:37
I've never heard anyone describe Bitcoin as stable.

It's just all about where you are able to sell your coins.  Bitfinex does not support/allow American customers and Coinbase does.  So if you are an American the GDAX price the "true" price.

Yeah, they include Bithumb where the only fiat withdraw is in KRW.  The Bithumb price is always higher than exchanges with USD withdraw.  So unless you have a Korean bank account, the coinmarketcap price isn't very accurate.

Thanks for the feedback.  Paul is definitely much more appealing than the others you mentioned.  I don't know if it's fair to couple socially liberal with big government.  They are two radically different things.

Might as well adjust your cost basis.  Just sell and then buy back asap.  
Note: I have no idea what I'm talking about.

You handled criticism of that comment well.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:12:38
Then multiply by two, if it makes you feel better.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:45:38
That's a ridiculous generalization.
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:51:48
I can understand where is coming from. Paul is awesome for pulling that off yesterday and should be commended.  It's just disappointing that I could never support him for POTUS based on his social conservatism.

You guys all act like he is some kind of nimrod.  He actually makes a couple decent points. In the interview I read, he didn't say cryptocurrencies were doomed.  He cautioned people that the price could fluctuate heavily.  Do you all think that Bitcoin is a lock to be the future of money?  It seems to me that cryptocurrencies are without question the future.  But there are many instances throughout history where the first instance of a technology doesn't become dominant.  It could be that Dogecoin or some competitor that doesn't even exist yet takes over and Bitcoin will be a novelty.  
Also, shouldn't we all "beware"?  We should all be hedging our bets.

It's one of the biggest issues for cyrptos at this time.  We are still in an early adopter phase.  
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:18:07
Also, we could live in a world where bitcoin is seen as a good store of value while an alt is used for small transactions.

She doesn't need evidence, they did forensic analysis!  
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:46:19
It'll be okay.
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:36:03
So either way, it's a bug.

I think a proprietary communication system on a communication device should be reason enough not to use that product.

he specifically encouraged and promoted drug use in pursuit of ever greater profits. As
evidenced at trial, Ulbricht went so far at one point as to offer customer prizes on Silk Road –
including a vacation giveaway – as a marketing gimmick designed to drive up the drug sales on
the site. In a chat about the promotion with a co-conspirator, “VJ,” Ulbricht joked about the fact
that he was, in essence, offering incentives to buy drugs (“we’re selling drugs here, first one’s
free little jonny! damn that sounds awful”). (GX-226C at 2). Tellingly, the winner of the grandprize
vacation was a heroin addict. In a later chat about the promotion, “VJ” told Ulbricht he
was “worried about our winner,” explaining: “He’s trying to dry out. Heroin.” Ulbricht
responded, “oh geez. fuck, what are we doing.” “VJ” continued: “Yeah, he told me some time
ago he was trying to quit, but SR made it kinda tough.” Ulbricht mockingly retorted: “maybe
our next prize will be 3 months in rehab.” (GX-226C at 2-3). 
I'm incapable of feeling empathy for this guy.

I agree.  The entire bitcoin ecosystem could be attacked by focusing on two or three targets.  That's a shortcoming.

There's already no benefit to running a node aside from the warm fuzzy feeling.  You are suggesting that a node operator must also tie coins up too?

A bunch of exchanges are calling it BCC.
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:59:36
I get it. Like I said I thought you had a good idea. But I think it's accomplished with one use of the word own.
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:10:56
I like it.  But why not just "Own your money"?  It's simple and has the same message.
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:54:56
Well, you can't own someone else's money.  If you did, it wouldn't be theirs.  There isn't a semantic reason to have the second own.

I haven't been paying too much attention to all the drama going on with Reddit lately.  Could someone give me the cliff notes? From what I can tell it seems like there's a lot of misinformation floating around.  What's the impetuous for a migration? Do you think it's justified?
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:55:02
You have info you can't tell us (or just too lazy) and you used a throwaway.  I'll hold your opinion in high regard.

It's still good advice if you're preparing to buy a house.

I think it was just a typo (should be hold) that people thought was funny and ran with.
