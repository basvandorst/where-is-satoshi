Thanks for posting this. I actually feel better about using Circle now that I know they are compliant with US laws -- less likely to be shut down randomly with users locked out of funds (like Igot).

Well, that's certainly a different and longer argument we should be having...
It's very much up for debate that BTC is better than existing card networks for mainstream consumers. Though -- assuming we are all BTC advocates here -- I'd love to see us all endeavor to make BTC the better payment system!

Not every consumer wants to hold their own private keys.
Actually quite the opposite; for BTC to go mainstream there need to be services like Circle that abstract away the complexities of BTC from the consumer

Gonna break some tough news for you guys: CIO of Nike to CEO of Bitreserve is a BIG step down

both circle and coinbase are credible services.
explained it below. the price you get for selling on circle is almost always better than the coinbase price, so youll make more money there.

Awesome, really excited for the chance to pay 2% per annum to Barry Silbert to sit on my BTC for me!

The biggest difference is: if you buy through the Bitcoin Investment Trust, you are literally paying Barry Silbert 2% per year to "manage" your bitcoin holdings for you. That 2% management fee takes the form of assets being taken out of the fund every year and paid to the management company, i.e. Silbert

Why did it take you 6 hours to do anything about this and why is the path to fixing it: someone posts to reddit -&gt; user operations manager reads on reddit -&gt; developers get notified? Shouldn't developers be on call to deal with outages like this?

I'll get downvotes for saying this but I think Circle and other bank-like bitcoin services should be judged vs the old traditional banking world. In that context, in the span of one day, the author opened a brand new "bank" account, did all the registration and KYC via his mobile phone, interacted in real time with support personnel via multiple channels including twitter. Think Bank of America or Citi could achieve that? And this is all from a startup whose public launch was 4 months ago. 
Not defending the poor messaging in the onboarding process though. It's bad that Circle didn't provide more details about what final step was needed to proceed with the transaction at the end.

Not to belabor the point, this is a man who personally invested in a 2FA company, should he not be educated about its uses? Also he demonstrates a number of other lapses in judgement throughout the article.
Good point about the accountant's negligence.

So I can sort of see your angle. For instance I could see Warren Buffett not fully understanding how IP addresses work
But for someone whose job it is to invest in emerging technology?
