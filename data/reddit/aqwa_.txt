From my understanding, there are no reasons to use MAST for regular transactions. If your wallet provider makes MAST tx for you instead of regular P2PK, it would be very suspicious.

@_date: 2017-12-17 11:10:03
Oh ok, thx. Never tried. Til 
But could this be a problem? It's up to you to create a script, hash it and send the address to the exchange, so there is no way an exchange can add a hidden condition to your MAST script right?

this is special storage for security purpose, banking grade. Not the one you find in usb sticks.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:02:55
I get your point but do exchanges support withdrawal to P2SH address today ?
I believe (tell me if I'm wrong) they don't, so they will probably not support MAST either and it will be up to you to setup such protection for your coin after a P2PK withdawal.

He's talking about "crypto\-actif" which translate to "crypto\-asset".
That's quite broad, but it definitely includes Bitcoin \(and also ICO tokens and shitcoins\).

When you build bigger roads, you don't solve traffic issues. You just postpone them, and you pay a high price for that. People will buy more car, and crowd your roads again soon.
Segwit and LN are a way to make the road smarter: instead of building bigger roads for cars, it creates public transportation.
That's me, a Computer Science guy trying to vulgarize core's scaling to you all, dumbheads who knows better than others what to do with bitcoin but who don't know shit about infrastructure scaling. You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:59:23
The minimum count give an indication on network availability.
Also, I think you can game the max node count with fake nodes, whether it's not possible for the min count. By fake node I mean temporary node that are fired for just a day.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:10:38
Then why isn't it implemented in BU ? 
From what I know, it doesn't offer a fix to malleability. Could BU focus on that at the same time as increasing blocksize?

Great, I'm eager to join the 21 club.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:06:09
Segwit change the rules on how to build a transaction. It allows significant savings in space (so you can put more transactions in every block) and, most importantly, fixes the Transaction Maleability bug.
This bug is blocking multiple Bitcoin improvement, like 2nd layer network that would allow Bitcoin to scale to thousands of transactions per second. This is why it is important to activate Segwit.

not everyone on earth has access to a 8+ lane road.
Having 1 lane is already a privilege, most people in the third world (those who needs Bitcoin the most) have very limited or no access at all to a road.
Sorry for my attitude, I admit it was lame.

That is true until these payment goes mainstream.
When there is a lot of money at stake, it is just game theory. 
Because it never happened doesn't mean it can't happen, but I agree that for most transactions, a fast blockchain is more convenient.
Anyway, my point was that a confirmation in Bitcoin isn't the same as a confirmation on other blockchains, but from your answer I guess you already knew it.

But then you have the debate on "does your pizza transaction need to be replicated on 5k nodes around the world forever ?".
I don't think so, it's killing flies with bazooka and it is not viable on the long term. Ethereum blockchain is already bigger than Bitcoin's one, that is not sustainable. At least, not on a truly decentralized system.
Pizza's transaction should go off chain on rayden or LN, that is my belief.

That is not true. Fees on payment channel won't be paid to miners.
That's why they want bigger blocks, onchain scaling means more fees for them, unlike second layer payment.

It doesn't have the same hashpower value. It would be much harder to reverse your bitcoin transaction.
The security of a confirmation when comparing blockchains is not given by the number of confirmation but by the energy spent on validation.
Depending on the transaction $ value, one confirmation won't be considered safe, and even more on fast blockchains like the Ethereum platform.

When you setup a ledger nano, it asks you to write down on paper a mnemonic, 12 words that can recover everything in your nano when entered on a new nano.
These words are not enough, there is also a password that protects the mnemonic.
So you write down the words and remember the password. If you loose your wallet, that's everything required to restore it in a new one.
It's not a huge problem if someone steal the paper with your mnemonic, because they don't have the password for it. A simple 10 characters password is enough to be safe and easy to remember.

Yes, 10 minutes is just the average time. Sometime, you get a block 10 seconds after the previous one, sometime you have to wait 30 minutes! But these are extreme cases, variance is low in practice.

1) I don't think it is because of GPU.
The situation was worse 6 month ago, with Dwarfpool owning close to 50% hashrate.
It happened to bitcoin as well !
I guess it is a matter of time and popularity.
2) At least GPUs are not build by miners.
The business of GPU is far greater than crypto, so it eliminates the unfair advantage of huge pools building their own asics.
For sure Bitfury will release its asic to market, but I doubt they won't take a big advantage from it first.

It secures a dedicated hashrate, but to the cost of an increased centralization.
I think a lower hashrate better distributed is better than a centralized higher hashrate, when the network's hashrate becomes big enough.
@_date: 2016-11-11 17:23:09
You could invest in GPU instead of asics.
CPU's of botnet can't do much against GPU farms.
And GPUs can be used for a lot of other computation, whereas asics are only doing SHA.
I'd love to help the bitcoin network with my GPU, and just stop my node when I want to play a game.

@_date: 2017-09-24 07:30:44
The Nano represent something like 1% of the total sales of ledger.
Plus, they have an open API if you want to add this particular functionality yourself. And electrum already interfaces with the nano and allows you to sign message. What else do you want? It's a small team.
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:11:38
Then it's a more general problem.
The same problem exists with IP adresses. How do you know you are on the real reddit, for instance ? How do you know your DNS server didn't lie and provided the real IP for reddit.com ?
You know you know you're safe thanks to the SSL certificate (aka green lock next to URL). But this is a centralized source of trust, which Bitcoin doesn't have. Maybe in the future there will be such certificate for "certified" Bitcoin addresses. Until then, you have to take extra care of what you do, and hardware wallets are of great help but can't do all the work for you either. 
If you're about to send funds, find a way to check the recipient address on 2 different devices, that should do it.

meh. I don't buy it. C'mon, it's just a linux distribution. If it's that secure, why do you need a hardware wallet in the first place ?
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:56:43
not if you check the destination address on the device's screen everytime you do a transaction (that's why there is a screen on the device in the first place)
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:36:25
Man that's so unlikely to happen. What you describe is not a problem with hardware wallets but with exchanges.
Most exchanges send you a confirmation email when you withdraw with the withdrawal address so you can double check it. Maybe they could do the same for deposit addresses ? Then your Mitm attack would require to hack both computer and smartphone (I use my phone for emails). good luck with that.
In any case, that's not Ledger's responsibility, and I feel much more relaxed having one to manage my funds.
They did everything to secure their share of the transaction process, it's up to other actors like exchange and OS providers to do their job now.

These are valid points, for a very paranoid user. But you can achieve the same with a simple windows computer with a guest account and minimal permissions. You'll have secure boot, no rights to install new software, and an up to date system, for more or less the same cost.
If you don't care about the cost, a macbook air can do the job as well.

But he's following this idea I think:

Actually the chip embedded in the nano was discontinued by its manufacturer so they had to stop building it. Not ledger's fault.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:43:54
Oh yes for sure, but people buying hardware wallet must be at least a little bit aware of tech, I believe.
At least tech savvy people have a way to check integrity of their hardware that is stronger than a simple plastic seal :)

He's not the only guy working for Blockchain.info that is against 2X. That's the least I can say.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:49:48
There's a difference between an event where only some business are invited and an event with "open" entry. We didn't pay to come express our opinion, it simply happened that most of us have the same feeling about 2X and that's what I realized at this conference because whenever the subject was discussed, the crowd agreed very clearly.
2X haters didn't plan to meet at this conference, it's not a coincidence.
My conclusion is that r/bitcoin is not an echo chamber, because in real life users also hate 2X. Even people working for NYA companies at this conference were personnaly against 2X !
Maybe the attendance is not representative of all Bitcoin users, but at least it is very clear now that the tech-aware people are against 2X. And I guess we are the ones people should listen to when it comes to Bitcoin updates.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:53:56
Think long term please. We don't want to divide the market cap even more, and 2X has been debunked as a shitty idea by most of the technical community anyway.

He used to be the minister of french economy, so he went to various "French Tech" events where he met the guys from Ledger (a french startup).
That's it. This guy is not our friend.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:48:15
The author didn't got it. 
Especially when he talks about "UASF blocks". There is no such things, just Segwit blocks. Miners who signal Segwit will see their blocks added to the UASF chain, that's the power of UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:13:33
What about you and other Core devs joining them to help getting this done?
2mb+segwit with 80% hashpower is an interesting compromise. Very few people would accept to wait one more year untill segwit expires. And if you guys join the development, pretty much all users would be happy, despite HF. Think about it, we can't neglect 80% of the hashpower, so we'd better be part of the change proposed rather than watching them doing crap and hurting us all indirectly.
Isn't this compromise infinetely better than BU ?
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:01:41
Power to the people!
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:43:54
The consensus between users is more important than the one between miners. Most of us want segwit, it's an overwhelming majority. And no, stagnation is not fine.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:44:40
Aren't they saying Sewit will be signaled "immediatly" ?
Edit:Oh no, it's "simultaneously" with the 2mb HF. Fuck them. UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:06:35
How do you garantee the miners that the HF will happen after segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:07:40
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:15:52
I hope it will become obvious that BIP148 is the only way.
We have 2 months, i'm optimistic.

Segwit is an update that will allow Bitcoin to scale by allowing the existence of a 2nd layer above Bitcoin (like TCP which exists over IP, if it can help you).
However, this update is controversial among miners, because some of them take profit from the current situation where the network is all clogged.
 Long story short, the community and the devs want an update, and the miners are stalling it. Please, don't pick a side in this debate before knowing what it is about, and don't jump to quick conclusions because it requires a lot of thinking to reach the point where most of us are now (advocating for UASF to push the update). Good luck in your journey of understanding Bitcoin ! It's a long path and nobody finished it yet, even if some pretentious people pretend to :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:12:14
If it's good code and it's fully compatible with Core, I don't see why I should complain.
Not everything is pure black or white in this world.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:27:14
80% hashpower in favor of the proposal is a good reason, imho.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:53:42
Bitcoin has a limited number of transaction per second, and Segwit is an answer to this problem (scaling).
However, despite a massive approval by users, miners and blocking it because it will lower their wage on short term.
UASF/BIP148 (same thing) is a method to force miners to activate Segwit. It is getting more and more support from users. 
It's very technical, you need to learn many things about Bitcoin first before taking a side on this debate :)
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:22:36


Oh come on. Don't insinuate that I'm not thinking. We're all thinking here so please, have some respect. And detail your thinking, so maybe I can understand you. 


I don't get your argument. Aren't miners literally brute forcing consensus? How is that superior to users consensus ? That's a quite arbitrary position you have.

Lightning needs the layer 1 for creating channels and settling conflicts. I doubt the blocks will go empty!
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:10:47
What we talk about here is having a -uasf flag in Core. That alone will be enough tu push the number of UASF node. People are scared to run things not included in Core.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:46:59
Nah, they want "simultaneous" activation.. I read too fast :'(
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:22:25


Do you really want me to talk about the debt of the USA ? 


Socialism/capitalism/communism are not what rule a country, these are just ideology: you could have a democracy with socialism, capitalism or communism, that would still be a democracy.
Well, I believe Bitcoin is a democracy, and when I say "power to the people" that is what I mean. Why do you even talk about communism ?

It's both at the same time, we won't fuck em up that easily..
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:40:30


Wrong, the only thing that will prevent it is all miners signaling segwit :)
That's the spirit of UASF, and I embrace it. The bolder we are, the higher our chance of having segwit activated soon.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:51:34
hmm yeah. Why not. 
But I'm not convinced the BU miners are interested in 2mb. 
I feel like these fuckers just want governance, and blocksize is a pretext. i hope I'm wrong, though.
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:28:49
A node simply verify and relay transactions, it doesn't require a farm :)
What you're talking about is mining.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:15:13
Core is not including it yet. Getting a UASF node is not easy now, it's already nice to have 8% despite this fact. When Core put a -uasf flag, things will get real !
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:13:12
A simple -uasf flag would do the job even better.
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:55:09
Why ? What's the drawback ? If every people/business supporting segwit was supporting UASF, we would get Segwit and there would be no chain split or any other problem.
Without UASF, we're just doomed to wait for Jihad to change his mind, which will never happen.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:31:26
Why do you invest in Bitcoin then ? You can already do online transactions with fiat, do you know that ? 
And for your information we got plenty of socialist countries in Europe and we're doing fine ;)
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:21:51
You don't need a huge majority of hashpower with UASF, that's the whole point. Simply by having more than your opponent is enough, for instance 55% is enough.
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:14:48
Wallet providers don't have to signal anything, you got it wrong.
Go ask your exchange to signal instead!
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:44:01
Okay. But segwit is not a political campaign, it's a bugfix for malleability. If a bugfix doesn't pass for political reasons, then something is wrong !
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:56:23
That's not how I understand UASF works. I don't agree with OP either. 
What we need is exchanges, and other major comercial actors, to be enforcing BIP148. It could succeed even with less than 51% hashrate if these actors are onboard.
Edit: hmm maybe not. Someone did a game theory analysis of UASF, I lost the link. And forgot the outcome.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:51:28
Segwit is a bugfix for malleability. That is a fact, nobody can deny it. And the 95% threshold was not meant to be considered as voting, but to signal beeing ready, that's what Segwit designers say.
But this intention has been hijacked by some miners, and I don't see what other solution than UASF we have available to apply this bugfix. What should we do ? I'm not satisfied with such an important bug remaining forever in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:53:33
Segwit alone, which is a softfork (safe) buys us 7 years. What's the point of adding a dangerous hardfork just to buy 10 more years ?
7 years is enough to setup the Lightning network , and if it doesn't, it doesn't exclude making a 2mb hardfork further down the road.
I don't see the point of doing segwit+2mb at the same time. It's too risky in term of chain split. Let's do segwit first.
