I don’t understand your viewpoint and disagree with your dark sentiments but I respect your word, please feel free not to support. I hope to foster a change and make a decentralization in crypto grow. That’s my only goal, not capitalization. I want the best for all

Approximately 120 millions people are expected to watch the Super Bowl this year. Converting a dollar on .01% would cause a skyrocket of people learning about cryptos. And that’s being conservative

I hoped this post would be one of faith and user input to help make this the best it can be thus the ad will be made from all the input given by the donators. If you don’t believe 3 seconds is enough in a world where the attention span is less than 7 seconds of curiosity I understand but respectfully disagree

Funding a decentralized form of payment could help millions of people that are in dire need of funds. As a person that wires over funds to my grandparents I know time and fees are ridiculous and costly not only financially but socially. This is long term push  my friend

I love this idea let’s do it! This benefits everyone. Let’s get some traction and make this a reality.

I understand. Bitcoin is decentralized, fast, and doesn’t include fees. Supporting bitcoin hopefully allows my grandparents to receive the full amount of money I send to them to get the food they need. That’s a form of feeding the hungry. Does that make sense?

By being completely transparent I hope to foster change. I don’t know if it’ll work and I understand your perspective and don’t want people assuming the same thing you are. If you have ideas on how to help secure the process I am more than willing to listen. That is 100% my intention
