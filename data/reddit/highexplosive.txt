My absolute favorite line from the pre-tax discussions concerning the IRS and what-not this year:
*YEAH I'M TOTALLY GOING TO VOLUNTARILY PAY TAXES ON MY PSEUDO-ANONYMOUS CRYPTO-CURRENCY*

Anyx4+. Also, encrypt the wallet with a passphrase and put it in a Truecypt 7.1a container file as well, at least. Don't store wallet.dat on the drive alone.

My ONLY complaint is that they need to make the currency drop down work with BTC and not just USD.

Wait. Two Weeks^TM ?

My ain't care level is an at all-time high right now. I will continue to mine at home (in a pool, of course). I ignore electricity costs when it comes to the miners.
I don't do this for the immediate profit, I do it for the eventual gain in value of BTC.


lulz. Never going to happen.

That is really surprising.

I donated .01 earlier but have sent some more.
Been using it for a few years now and honestly I never considered donating before seeing this post. :feelsbadman:

I like the blinking lights.

You're not wrong but please note that the multi-mining pools such as Wafflepool, CoinShift, and CleverMining do not mine Bitcoins directly.

Do you require an imprint of my left nut? Because that's seemingly what it takes to use one of these fucking machines, ANYWHERE.

Did earlier today! And had someone else do their thing too.
I was on Kidney Puncher about accepting Bitcoin and they were too slow. Thank you!

It reads to me as an exponentially decreasing rate of diminishing returns as you get closer to zero. I mean, we're all ready there.

Insidious comes to mind for me.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:03:33
And it was both! This is a wonderful find.

Our existence under their thumbs is also *generational*. That fact is not lost on all of us. And it's sickening to think how advanced we would really be without killing each other off for no good fucking reason but that's another topic entirely.

The funny part is that they'll recommend rental properties and other avenues of income generation but the minute you start advocating anything in the crypto scene it's holy water and pitchforks, and they would lay down a layer of brimstone if possible.
That said, that subreddit is not the place for crypto discussion.

PF is all about the slow climb to eventual stability with what has been the norm for so, so many years. They are very risk averse and not the right audience for Bitcoin discussion.
That said, if I were 19 and had 10 grand to "bet", half would go into live crypto and the other half would fully fund my 2017 Bitcoin IRA.

Right, some risk is acceptable but that steady 6-7% yearly gain is what they're after, as per the tradition.

No shit?
