Say that enough bitcoins are hoarded (not lost, as we thought), such that there's only 1 bitcoin being moved around the economy which has been subdivided down such that people are still using nano-bitcoins for everyday transactions, so 0.000000001 bitcoins is worth $1 or whatever. Then some guy with 50BTC that he's been holding onto the for the last 100 years decides to sell them to the open market. To start with, there would NOT be 51BTC of buy orders, there's be 0.001 of buy orders, so this guy would offload 0.001 of his BTC for the sum of all the buy orders, say $100,000USD, but now there's ZERO buy orders and he can't sell anymore. Seeing the opportunity to buy BTC cheap, people start placing buy orders at lower and lower prices, and so as the economy goes from 1BTC to 50BTC, the "value" of everyone's BTC drops and drops until this guy has completely offload his 50BTC for diminishing and diminishing returns (say he gets $1mill out of it), so he stops selling, the price finds equilibrium again and all is well. For some other guy also hoarding 50BTC, if he decides to cash out he'll make peanuts by comparison.
Want a real life example? De Beers once held nearly 90% of all diamonds in the world, to keep prices artificially high, the exact scenario you suggest with a "LOL", and the diamond economy still exists.

I was speaking from the perspective of someone's ability to buy and sell BTC, USD, gold, or oil, the market operates essentially the same regardless of whether the Wikipedia definition of "commodity" or "currency" is met. Idiot? I guess a response on the same level is something like "I know you are you said you are but what am I?" Come on, let's continue the discussion like we're not 12, it just distracts.
In your more realistic example of someone with $2500T in an otherwise $50T economy, buying something for $1T will not devalue the currency by "just 2%". The MtGox incident caused the theft of 1/13th of the economy, but caused a devaluation from $15 to $3, so the devaluation due to oversupply is definitely not linear. I totally agree that 50BTC in a 1BTC economy would kill Bitcoin, but a 1BTC economy is just an outrageous thought exercise used to illustrate that someone couldn't just buy the world, even in bits, because the devaluation is non-linear.
To move on to your more realistic example, as of June the top 10 balances summed to just under 1,000,00BTC, and most of their wealth was created at a time when BTC was worth a lot less and mining was a lot easier. If I had the top wallet from June, with its 438,000BTC, increasing my balance is just as hard for me as it is for everyone else - I got a good start... but furthering my domination is now really hard, and it's only going to get harder as the value and adoption of BTC increases. Meanwhile my incentive to sell out and buy a house, a boat, and a private jet keeps getting stronger which will tend to spread wealth, but assuming I just hoard, once BTC are no longer being produced I will control 2.3% of the economy. If the top 10 wallets ALL hoard until BTC is the global currency, the most wealthy 10 wallets will in the end control 5% of the economy. This is not so different to the current distribution of wealth, where the top 0.001% of people control 30% of the world economy. 10 people controlling 5% of the economy is very different to 1 person controlling 10% in your example.
That being said, I don't personally have a problem leaving the 50BTC reward in place. If BTC ever did become a world currency (which I doubt, but just assuming), it will be in the next 20 years. Under the current model, there would be 20835937.5 BTC (top 10 wallets control 4.79%), under a 50BTC mining model there would be 39375000BTC (top 10 wallets control 2.5%), close to halving the purchasing power of the early adopters, which I think is a "good thing". However I disagree that it's not inflationary, because in 20 years in the inflation rate will be 4% - about the same as many major currencies today. Given the acceleration of technology and so on, I think 100 years is very very optimistic for the lifetime of BTC, and in 1000 years we'll be lucky if the human race hasn't exterminated itself. 1000 years ago we were only just discovering the numeral "zero", so I think a 20 year future is a much more reasonable horizon.

A currency and a commodity really only differ in that a commodity has some inherent value, like gold's use industrial uses, but since gold is worth well above its base industrial value so it essentially is a currency, but that makes no practical difference to the analogy. 
The current market cap of bitcoin is nearly $380m, and say that of that 380m, you owned $300mUSD of it, while everyone else is trading using the $80m left over. Now say that you want to buy my Pacific Ocean island, and I'm offering it for sale for $250m USD. You offer me $250m in BTC, but I know that I can't easily convert that into USD, which I want, because there aren't buyers of BTC for that kind of volume, so I reject your offer.
So you decide you need to buy my island in chunks, I'm happy to sell you 1/100th for $2.5mUSD in BTC, but then I sell all my BTC and the value of BTC drops, and you can't seem to buy any more of my island. 
So no a man with 50BTC can't buy a company, or government, because noone in their right mind would a huge portion of the entire market cap of any currency or commodity, because it becomes impossible to convert to anything else of value.

Totally fair point that the market will notice the dumping of gold, which is typically done on an exchange market, much more quickly than printed currency which can be used to buy goods and services before the currency is devalued.


This is the part where I say "You just can't help the snipe, can you?" you say "I can't help but snipe stupid people", and then I say that you're being pathetic, and you call me a fag. Can we be done with this part of the discussion?


That doesn't seem right. Wikipedia's graph on  seems to indicate an increase in M2 money supply from $7,500B to $8,500B, or a 15% increase in the amount of money, and 2008 definitely saw a spike in the CPI. Admittedly it was more linear than I expected, but I imagine it would be less linear if the increase in supply was much more than 15%. If anything I think it goes to show that if the 10 biggest wallets did wait 20 years and then suddenly go crazy with all their money, the effect would probably be less than that of the US government bailout, and so the protocol is not really in need of the solution that you propose.

Relax man it was an honest mistake for him or her to make
