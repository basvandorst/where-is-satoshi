Eth needs Casper implimented to sustain that high valuation. With a price of 15k daily issuance would be around 300kk. Kinda high for this market.

They don't accept ETH donations btw. I guess you can pretend it's not there but reality won't change much.

My point is that BTC will never be the currency used to MICRO transactions with these fees. Sure i can pay 0.06$ to transfer 5k but i will never spend 0.06$ to transfer 1$. If the future of bitcoin is just store of value then its fine i guess.

Most participants in this debate fail to realise that bitcoin is not here to stay, unless it remains usefull. 
My last txn took 15h to complete and had a cost of 0.4usd for 40usd. How is this competing with XMR, ether, dash, litecoin, etc??

There are no spam transactions. There are either valid or invalid ones.

Back then it costed a few hundred USD to reach bitcoins limits. It's not the same. Hashing power and price have skyrocketed since.

 This is no offense- u are just brainwashed. Your revolution is more like a suicide. Economic majority will not risk beign left outside of the biggest chain so they wont impliment BIP148, they run businesses with customers. 
This community needs a safer path to scaling, not random **non technical shills** droping memes.

Ethereum **IS** bitcoin. 
The vision stays alive with another name but with the original properties. Enyone is free to jump off the Titanic.

The store of value narrative is flawed af. There are zero assets in the world that work just as store of value. It is not a sustainable system.
