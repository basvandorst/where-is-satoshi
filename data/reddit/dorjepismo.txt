One of two things:
(1) The hand of God coming out of the ceiling pointing right at your ass; or
(2) The degredation of civilization to the point where nobody trusts government currency.
You can take Bitcoin right now.  Post an address, tell folks how many, there you go.  A few people will take you up on it.  20 minutes later, you'll have confirmation.  What it's worth is another matter, and how that fits with your accounting system and the IRS and sales tax authority is yet another.  To solve the problem, there will be one or two services in the middle to handle the complexity.  Sort of like PayPay, which skims 3.5%, more or less.  Will it be competitive?  If so, then not by much.

Darn.  Any way to configure a stop loss so that the price has to stay down for more than 30 seconds?

You know, they're saying how they will manage their listings, but not the wallets of their customers.  If there's a fork, then the exchanges should give everyone an account with the same amount of coins for the new alt, since both blockchains will show the same number of coins at the same addresses.  Are they going to do that, or should we be moving our coins out of the exchanges until after the fork?

Had the same problem.  Got everything else set up and asked support to look at the uploads manually.  They fixed it.  Maybe 6 months ago--they might have too much on their plate right now.
