Who is "they?"
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:52:27
It's "you're." So have you been using your parents allowance money to buy btc?
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:08:38
Wow, awesome! First you made me laugh during this odd and stressful Bitcoin saga. Then you share the wealth. First bitcoin tip...Check! Thanks again,  friendo. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:57:51
Feel you. My wife was reading about how Bitcoin is a scam, from a link on People.com. Ha. I've been defending it and depositing money on bitfloor. Unfortunately bitcoin is not the problem. The exchanges are. I was so proud of myself for figuring the system out and getting in the game. Ha, now this.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:55:07
They are a huge exchange,  so I would imagine our funds wouldn't get stuck permanently. Might not be a bad idea to go ahead and set up an ACH withdraw request.  ... So much for anonymity. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:43:30
I hear you. I may need to PM myself as well. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:43:41
This is mind blowing. Can not believe this guy is acting as if nothing has happened. Thought for sure he was in hiding.    --- I've got to stop thinking about this and count it as a very expensive lesson. Its driving me crazy. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:02:16
I'm confused as to why it seems that no one can log in (10am CST), but there are trades being executed. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:43:50
Nice job on the timely post and getting the word out.     Would you mind taking out the email header, now that everyone knows that it was legitimate?
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:50:37
Why do people post stuff like this? You're an asshole. Fuck off. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:29
Bitfloor. I can't find a reliable chart right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:00:26
This makes sense. The last deposit I made was under 1k and the teller said "Do you mind if I ask what LocalTill is?" He wasn't being weird,  it just made me wonder if there was a magic number that requires them to ask. I'm sure he was just curious because I had been in before. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:29:26
Ok, great. That makes sense. I will PM you.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:49:16
That's what we hope. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:39:24
I'm ok with not getting my funds out right now,  but why do you think they are saying to transfer BTC out? 
Sounds like a bigger issue than just their USD account. Here we go again. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:27:54
Not sure why you're getting downvoted.  I had never really thought of it that way. I personally believe Audenx has had everyone's best interest in mind. Although, I tend to trust until proven untrustworthy. 
I think it's just an all around bad situation. I wrote the money off long ago. If I get it back,  great. If not,  it's a life lesson. If I have 30k tied up, it would be a different story.   ..... Whatever happens... I still feel that  Roman is a miserable excuse for a person. From a legal aspect, his silence is understandable. He has been far from silent on his personal account,  which is appalling. Don't run around acting as if nothing is wrong,  when some have their entire life savings tied up in your failed business.   .... Just my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:37:32
Having trouble finding their "verification limits." Would you mind pointing me in the right direction? 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:34:58
Update: As of 5:28pm EST,  there are NO deposit options. Looks as though they are going to be down for a while. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:33:55
Perfect. Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:20:07
Great idea!  I must admit, I'm a little leery about putting my email and cell phone number in. I didn't notice anything on the site about the privacy policy. I don't need any more spam. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:10:28
@_date: 2013-07-25 16:05:49
Can't help but feel like these are just more stall tactics. Also, considering our money has been tied up for months, you'd think Roman would share some of the profits he's made over the years. 
Bitfloor... What an embarrassment. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 02:57:00
It's posts like this that make we wish Reddit had age restrictions. You can't be over 14, right? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:45:46
I just watched it go from, $147 to $180 to now $220, all within 10 minutes. Crazy! 
Edit: Bitfloor. I clicked buy @ $147, but didn't finalize the order. Thinking it would still go down. Then a couple minutes later on decided to go ahead and buy, but it had gone up to $180.
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:55:12
That makes sense. The frustrating thing for me,  is that every good trade just gets me closer to being back to zero. Sad. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 01:39:33
Can't even begin to imagine how much of other people's money this guy has lost. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:51:16
I'd at least get in line. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:18:19
Actually laughed out loud. I'm also slightly delusional from reading all this stuff about bitfloor. Hope my money doesn't disappear.   ... (Great post BTW,  can't stop laughing) 
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:15:32
Ha! Although funny, I had hoped the Colbert piece would have been better PR for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:48:13
Same thing here. It showed up for a bit. Now it's gone. I can't cancel or buy anything either. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:41:35
Impressive!  I'm interested in one.  What would it cost for one with just a first name, letters only? Full size or Med size. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:52:47
It's almost guaranteed that if I wait, watch the charts for weeks, wait, and then finally buy in.... it's going to go down. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:33:53
Me @ $230 on 4/9 and @ $150 on 4/10. First buys. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:13:13
Or loose half of it, if you bought and sold today, at that price.

Thanks for the replies. I have nothing to hide. Just don't want it to look as though I'm doing something shady. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:23:05
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:05:00
I should probably do the same. Would you mind explaining a little more about the lessons you learned? I'm only asking because I feel a bit silly when I take cash to buy a 1k money order, to send to another, possibly untrustworthy,  exchange. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:31:05
This is great! Not sure why you don't have more upvotes. Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 01:35:57
If I receive my investment,  it will be less the fees I paid to get it into Bitfloor and back out of Bitfloor. Not to mention the unrealized gains over the past few months. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:42:31
Not so nice now,  for both of us. :( Wish I had heard about bitcoin before last week. Ha. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:59:22
Giving advice is one thing, gloating about others misfortune is another.

Received an alert, but it was several hours too late. Is anyone else noticing major delays?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:57:21
I'm confused. Who are you talking to and why are you so upset? 
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:01:12
Don't know much about the prepaid cards, but you may be better off to have the money transferred to a family or friends in the US.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:07:16
If it hasn't already,  it will be available soon. Mine just got released and my market order posted properly. Probably just the mass amounts of orders coming through. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:43:38
The CapitolOne tab is still there, but there no way to deposit. Wire Transfer is the only option that still works. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:37:25
Be glad it was only $50, other users are worried about thousands.  
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:58:03
Sorry... What about if I want the physical pad shipped to me? For a large or a mid sized one?
