It's almost as if it used to be the same network and then split. But that's not what happened!

That's why I like Most people here have a lot of capabilities. They are smart independent people that know what is up. A unique mix of the best of everything makes a good cypherpunk.We need those people so we can combine our forces and shout: bcash bcash bcash bcash bcash bcash.

A alt coin is a coin started from zero, a fork is a split in direction within a community. It's not like the people behind Bitcoin Cash are total newcomers. All of them have been active in the Bitcoin community before the fork. They just wanted to go in a different direction, with FOSS a fork allows that.
But to say that they are unaffiliated with Bitcoin is not fair. Gavin Adressen and Mike Hearn and many more have contributed to Bitcoin's succes.
