Thanks for all the comments, and I'm glad you pointed out that fees are clearly not the only thing Bitcoin has going for it.  But so far I don't see any opinions on the blocksize.  It doesn't appear that anyone here is for or against a change in the blocksize or the plusses / minuses of a hard fork.

if you keep fiat in a bank it is likely federally insured up to some reasonably high limit ($250k in the US usually i think).  If you keep bitcoin on an exchange or web based wallet and their servers go off-line, you are basically screwed.  So yea, I keep mine off-line, in my home, where  at least I feel comfortable accepting responsibility if it disappears.

Careful you don't buy BU or bitcoin classic by accident... One of them will be BTC and one of them will be dead.

Isn't this what the BTCe trollbox is for?

I wouldn't have noticed but it triggered my buy order also; it doesn't appear it dropped on any of the other exchanges

Anyone have a link to something that shows their donation address? 
@_date: 2015-11-21 23:54:24
Googled it, duh.

Unsuprisingly there is a large group that came into BTC when price when from $10-$100, and another large group that came into BTC when price went from $100-$1000, then not many since then.

This might be a good time to fire up my old asic and contribute at a loss for a while.  If everyone did this it could make a difference to secure and stabilize BTC

Interesting conspiracy theory(s), the possibility that the NSA could compromise Tor hidden services is the most likely.

Get a blockchain.info wallet, print a paper wallet pre-loaded with the amount you want to gift, then when you give it to them, show them how to setup their own blockchain.info wallet on their phone (although I think its Android only - Apple hates Bitcoin), then scan QR code and boom done!  Maybe give them a list of places to use them or some of the best exchanges.

I agree with chalash and bubble, buying mining hardware made more sense when it was GPUs that actually had some value after difficulty got too high.  ASICs will be worth next to nothing once difficulty gets too high.  I agree, buy 8-9k in BTC, plus if the next bitcoin bubble comes, you will have the whole investment in BTC, not in your mining hardware.

Anyone know what risks the buyer takes when filing these claims?  Does buying bitcoin via paypal violate their terms of service as well?

I'd sell at $1000, no sooner (but I'd look to buy back most of it after the bubble burst)
