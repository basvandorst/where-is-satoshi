See, both of you win in this case

I think he's able to discern what he can and can't risk. But I get what you're saying

His net worth is worth millions, but primarily tied up in stocks, real estate etc. He wouldn't liquify assests to invest. He's done pretty well for himself but is not a high-risk investor. He's accumulated his wealth over 40 years through many low-risk low reward Investments. But it's worked for him.

I get where you're coming from. But by guaranteeing he will experience no loss, I expose myself to last potentially. Because I know Bitcoin will only go up I'm not afraid to accept that risk. But in exchange I think it's fair to ask for compensation

Good point
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:28:39
Sure, I've talked him through the benefits and risks
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:10:39
And where did you get 100k
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:10:33
I don't have the liquidity to invest that much
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:29:11
Thank you ��

I do trade. He was only going to invest for 5K. And only because I talked him into it. If I am able to eliminate any risk for him he will invest more and profit more. In exchange for a limiting his risk I asked for a commission. It seems like a fair trade-off to me

What do you think the chances of that happening are? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:24:32
Uhh ya, I didn't down vote you
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:02:35
I will consider that down vote as a no lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:11:22
Yes I've taken on the risk for myself, there for transferring it from him to myself. Therefore he has no more risk.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:23:58
You are right, I should help him. I'm encouraging him to invest more, I think that is beneficial to him
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:15:33
It'll pay off

Can you not just write the private key on a piece of fucking paper and make multiple copies of it
