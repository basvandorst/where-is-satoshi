You acquire BTC through the same methods you acquire any other currency. Work for it, or buy it.

Yes, good opportunity to buy. Then have strong hands till 100k.

How long have you been running it?

I would suggest you learn to understand it more before you go dumping more money in. If you were skittish about the volativity the first time around, nothing has changed. You will lose more money. Figure out what you're trying to achieve. Noone knows what BTC is worth.
If you do plan on getting back into the market I would suggest no more day trading (aka gambling). Just buy and hold. And never EVER sell for less than you paid for it. Think of it as a lottery ticket that you have a chance at winning, and if you dont win then you will have already conditioned yourself to that risk.
This is not a sure thing, understand that and then take whatever risks you think you are able to.

Think about what you're asking... Thats like asking if there is websites that are handing out free USD or Euros. I dont know what you're current wage is, but you'd be better off doing 1 hour of work than trying to waste hours on those faucet sites collecting dust.

Wasn't implying you wanted a free lunch: just stating fact. Pretty much everyone here who has skin in the game has had to buy in with their own money. Mining is no longer viable.

Max didn't give a timeline on that. Strong hands to 100k.
