Compared to developing for Android I found Windows Phone to be easier. But perhaps it's a matter of taste.

Developing for Windows Phone is pretty nice tho as you have the full .NET experience and debugging is easy with Visual Studio.
And some people are expecting that Windows Phone will get way bigger in some time.
However for me: I was just searching for such an app and with none around I decided to make my own.

Had some spare time today. 
App has received minor textual changes and AUD has been added. You will receive the update once the store accepts it (might take a week).

I might add AUD this week then.
Currently the rates displayed are from MtGox.
Adding another currency takes more time but I might. Kinda depends on how many people are interested in this app. Mainly since it's a side project there is no price model here, only donations.

I revoked the update. I discovered a bug in the live tile updates.
Instead I decided to redo the settings screen and add all the currencies from MtGox. I'll probably finish it tomorrow somewhere.

I might aim for Windows Phone 8 first and convert it to Windows Phone 7.8 afterwards. 
Giving 2 serparate apps

And that aswell

Is this a native app i.e. is the wallet.dat hosted on the phone itself?
There already is a blockchain app. There isn't a coinbase app tho. But a native app would be nice aswell.

Gonna look for a good libary to use for starts.
Not much luck so far :&lt;
@_date: 2013-08-11 17:21:26
I do plan on making it open source.
I don't plan on making money with this app, it's the same as my other app (tho donations are always welcomed). Windows Phone simply lacks this app and in order to make Bitcoin a succes there should be an even distribution of wallets.

Thanks mate. I'm gonna work on the app!
@_date: 2013-08-11 15:27:56
I might make a separate app for that.

What currencies would you like to see?
