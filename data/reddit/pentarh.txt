As far as I understood, when someone buys XBT at this ATM, ATM sends API call to bitstamp to spend specified amount of fiat on buying XBT and then makes another API call to withdraw XBT to customer provided address.
If this is right - this is terrible behavior. ATM software puts outgoing transaction load to exchange. This is direct violation of any AML rules - send money (XBT) from authorized account to third party.
Bitstamp isn't paypal to act like that. It is exchange, not e-wallet. You should make withdrawals to Bitcoin addresses associated only with you.
ATM should have an intermediary hot wallet which would operate with Bitstamp and customers. I can understand Bitstamp if ATM software acts like that.

1. NMC destroys coins paid for "domain name" (transaction with OP\_RETURN opcode). Keeping in mind limited number of coins, this is a problem. Those coins should be somehow transfered to miner which verified domain transaction istead. I didnt find a way to do this.
2. Domain should have a price big enough to prevent spam/cybersquatting and small enough to keep demand. To keep price in theese borders in time, price should have callback to domain market activity. I.e. when demand is high, price keeps high. Demand goes low, price goes low. NMC had no callback. Domain price in NMC just descreases in time with hardcoded formula and I dont have idea where devs got that formula. It goes to zero, which eventually bring NMC chain to spam hell. Also I didn't find a way to make a proper callback of domain price to market activity.
3. NMC blockchain has all the records of all domains created/modified/expired for all time. This is progressively inflating database, which should inflate 10,100,1000x faster than Bitcoin, as it also contains domain string data. It cant be pruned, but it should be installed (and processed) on every DNS server, which supposed to be a tiny computer. Tiny clients are really not secure I think. So blockchain makes NMC not widely usable like BIND or other DNS server. This problem common for any blockchain-based application including bitcoin core and has no solutions so far - database just grow.
However NMC brough us satoshi's merged mining feature which is highly underestimated now.

Nlocktime is a parameter of transaction that makes it non final and doesn't allow to include in block. Moreover, nlocktime is still "todo" feature and transactions with it are simply declined. Who will keep your non final transaction in memory pool for years?

Public key is a product of one-way ecdsa transformation of private key.
Address is a product of one-way hash160 transformation of public key.
Yes, you may give your pub key, it may not compromise your private key. Even more, when you make payment from your address - your public key is exposed in script sig of transaction.
But since you didn't make payments from Address, nobody knows your public key. It's additional level of privacy.

It's great incentive! This is not (yet) actual, but in a future it may increase number of full nodes in network and remove extra "power of truth" from miners.

On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or "blockchain" which let users bypass bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins.[16][17] On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol.[18][19] This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in bitcoin's history.[16][17]

And... One not right calculation for discharge point for batteries or not right tenperature charge compensation - and yr batteries soon all die.

It needs some advanced modifications in miners, also need to assembly controllers.

using a bootstrap.dat is no longer recommended—you can see the release notes for the new faster-synchronization feature here 
As a result, the bootstrap.dat torrent links were removed from bitcoin.org after a short discussion 
The bootstrap.dat file is still available here  on the bitcointalk.org forum, and jgarzik has indicated that he will continue to occasionally update it "for academic research and development purposes."

I really don't understand main points of this organization. What do they do? What are their doings? How exactly they help Bitcoin? Where donation money are spent and what are proves? Indeed I appreciate Gavin. But who are others I don't know. There are few semi-scammers there like magical tux and bitinstant founder. Coinlab founder (member) sues with mtgox founder (member too).
What do that people do except sit in pathos?
What about growing blockchain size? I recognize it as main issue, as I am merchant.
Bitcoin has lot of problems. And what do they do?

Doesn't matter. You scream no fees and no middleman. This is not true. Your farmer will be bankrupt without middleman and fees.

Bitcoin was designed to avoid central authority. It's Bitcoin primary feature described in satoshi pdf. And you offer your bitcoin central authority. *Bitcoin* and *Central* are two different meainings from different centuries which destroy each other. I will not ever trust bitcoins to you or everyone else.

Guys, Bitcoin can be exchanged only for its anonymous equal - cash. Don't build illusions about governments will consider Bitcoin to be legal. Exchanging for everything other (wires, ewallet transactions, etc) - will always have high risk of money laundering accusations.

You say visa and paypal were hard because of fees. Please answer how that farmers cash out bitcoins? What fees do they pay for that? And how﻿  they would deal with volatility risks? Bitcoin can easily go either up or down by 20% in a day. Do they deal with risks via Bitpay? If so, why they say there is no middleman?

Pretty sad. Two years ago I was about to buy his 1000 XBT gold coin 
Unfortunately he didn't ship outside US gold coins. And also I saw many potential problems with customs.
So I bought couple of silver 10 XBT, copper 1 XBT and 100 XBT plate then. Those were not really big money - few hundreds bucks or so. I was surprised about fast delivery. EMS delivered right into my door in five days.
I had many fun days playing with coins and exposing to my friends. But all they said "I completely don't understand this technology, this physical coin with digital money is a complete template break for me".
I even gifted 1 XBT copper coin to my son and said that many years later he will be able to buy whole school for this coin (he is a school boy). :)
Some time ago I decided to buy more 10 XBT silver coins, but found that now Casascius minted only 1 XBT into silver :( And I went away.
And about week ago I decided to buy 1 XBT silver coin, but i saw a disclaimer in his website that sales are closed due to regulatory issues.
Casascius made a great job though!

Actually I respect only Gavin Andresen in this fucking team. Not because he is a part of this tent, but because of his doings on Bitcoin improvement. Who are others? Mark Karpeles? Who do not payout withdrawals during YEARS to people? Peter Vessenes? Who fucked up with money transmitter business registration? Charlie Shrem? Working hard on bitinstant get up for more than half year?
You know what they do? I only see their activity with sitting on sofa and jerking on bitcoin price rise. I don't realize the sense of this tent at all.

Yeah, but it's a trustless. And OP proposes to use middleman. Most of bitcoin middleman models are scam by practice - want you or not. Because there is no regulations.

Don't tell me about block chain size and terabyte disks. Space isn't issue, but performance is. I got two weeks ago "disk out of space" on my VPS okay? I need a day or more to initialize bitcoind with disks busy hard, okay?
bitcoind is starting to be an asspain. And what BF do about this?
And don't tell me to use somewhat like Bitpay. I will use bank merchant API if I want to use 3rd party middleman.

Recommended parameters for scrypt are N = 16384, r = 8, p = 1 (16 Mb usage). Litecoin uses N = 1024, r = 1, p = 1.
Add here faster block time and you get most unsecure cybercash.

Bitcoin isn't under any regulation, so watch in which ass you put your coins! It's a wild west.

What the fuck? I will not surprise if you may have problems with internal bank financial monitoring service. But judge?! What was the accusation?
I mean finmonitoring CAN ask you for explanations without grounds. But judge and police needs EXACT accusations for this. So either you don't tell us something or you lie.
