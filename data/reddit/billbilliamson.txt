This video wasn't ridiculing bitcoin.

Why are you bringing this up?  The guy you're replying to is talking about giving valuations to tech companies, not about the "back bone structure concept" of said companies.

I know what subreddit I'm in, idiot.  You people are throwing this quote around and misrepresenting it in order to discredit Warren Buffet.  The inability to find a fair valuation of a tech company has nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol.  Why is this so hard for you to understand?  The fact that you keep trying to make the discussion about bitcoin shows me that you don't understand the quote.

You can valuate those companies, but in all likelihood your valuation would be shit.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in internet companies.  You can take a position that benefits from volatility and price increases without being dependent on valuation models.  There are many successful traders who do not rely on fundamental analysis at all.

I can pay for things in fiat without counting out paper money, dipshit.

Keiser is a fucking idiot.  He's the Glenn Beck of cryptocurrencies.

No.  Both of you misunderstand the point is making.

Nice strawman.

He's not saying they don't have value.  He's saying that it's a waste of time to try and find the accurate value of these companies and to make precise predictions as to what they'll be worth in the future.  Bitcoin being a backbone is irrelevant.

Buffet's quote and Diddyk's post had nothing to do with bitcoin.  Why are you even bringing it up?

When you oversiplify regulation like that, it makes it hard to take you seriously.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:15:56
You're delusional.

Regulation caused those fuckups?  Which regulations and which fuckups are you talking about?  You surely can't be talking about the 2008 financial crisis.  Repealing Glass-Steagal, relaxing the net capital rule, and a lack of regulation regarding credit default swaps all contributed greatly to 2008.  In your defense, the Fed keeping interest rates artificially low certainly did not help, but to blame the whole thing on an excess of regulation is just dumb.

He's just explaining to you that Buffet is saying there is no reliable way to tell if small/young tech companies are priced fairly.

That comment should read "You cannot legislate away ALL crime and incompetence."  You can legislate away a meaningful amount of crime and incompetence.  Just because regulation failed to prevent a few fuckups doesn't mean we should scrap regulation altogether.
