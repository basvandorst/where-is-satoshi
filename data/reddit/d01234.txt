Bienvenidos a Calle Florida....  I read an [article]( a while back that explains the situation there a little better.

I honestly feel bad that this happened, but I think you are missing the point.


Any successful, open source, community type project would accomplish this; Mt.Gox has nothing to do with it.


Not really, since it would be crippled by debt and bureaucracy right from the start.  Running a successful business, especially a bleeding edge software business with exorbitant growth and uncertain regulatory implications takes continual investment and development, not to mention strong leadership.  It is not cheap or easy, even in a booming economy (Mt.Gox is a great example).  Paying debt instead of re-investing in technology will not allow it to compete on a level playing field with the other exchanges.
If creating a well run exchange were an easy thing to do, there would be a lot more people doing it successfully.  The only way something like this happens is if some very talented people get determined.  People like that don't need or want the baggage of Mt.Gox's debt.

This is a great example of the [sunken cost fallacy](  The best option here is some sort of bankruptcy proceedings and moving on with one’s life (and the life of bitcoin).  The plan wouldn’t work for a multitude of reasons (sorry for the obvious overuse of quotes):
* the original business does not have anything of value to salvage.  Its reputation is bad, its code is bad, its finances are bad, and nobody here seems to want to leverage any of the knowledge and experience that exists within whatever staff it has.
* although it may start with a large "user base" with some sort of vested interest in using the service, the "shareholders" would essentially be paying themselves with their own transaction fees
* that large "user base" doesn't have any fiat or BTC in their accounts (unless they choose to continue "investing" in "Mt.Gox"), so how are the "shareholders" going to make any money on transactions if there is no money in any accounts?
* the only way any of the "shareholders" make any money back is when "non-shareholders" put money into the exchange.  What incentive does a "non-shareholder" have to put money into a new exchange with untested code and unproven management?  Did anybody learn anything from this Mt.Gox fiasco?
* a small company with zero assets (ie. a fresh start) is much more likely to be successful than a large company with zero assets, a pile of bureaucracy (due to its size and number of "shareholders"), and a mountain of debt.
* anyone who has the required skills for starting their own exchange would be better off doing it themselves.  Some critical skills I can think of here are: risk management and knowledge of how to properly implement the bitcoin protocol.  It is not likely that the "shareholders" who left large amounts of currency in Mt.Gox are the best at risk management.
* there are obvious legal challenges and privacy concerns of combing through every user's account information to determine ownership
* there are obvious challenges to determining a proper exchange rate for for "shares" in a multitude of different currencies
I do think that a transparent, credit union style exchange could be a great thing for bitcoin, but it (and bitcoin in general) would have a lot more chance to be successful if it has nothing to do with Mt.Gox.  A non-profit, open source exchange with community reviewed code might go a long way to develop best practices and bring back some respectability amongst the masses.  Not to mention, it could provide some funding for the development of the bitcoin core.
