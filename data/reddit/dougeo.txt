Don't worry about it. Everyone likes to think they can tell if an idea is good or not but 99% of them can't. If everyone just accepts your idea is brilliant then you probably don't have a great idea.

I work at a place that has a bitcoin ATM and most of the customers are not in that demographic. Most of them would never take part in this kind of survey so I would take these results with a grain of salt.

Are Bitcoin backed fiat debit cards a good solution for onboarding the average person into using bitcoin?

Some people care more about getting rich than freedom. To those folks the BTC price is all that matters.

There's an interesting pattern that's present in the Bitcoin market cap chart: [BTC All time Market Cap]( If the pattern holds true then there's another big wave of growth coming.

It's backed by the same thing the internet is backed by, a strong network effect that will only become stronger as non-tech individuals reap the benefits of a non-centralized currency.
