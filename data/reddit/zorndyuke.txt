Just watched gdax for a couple minutes and it's funny (annoying) watching everyone be like "OMG! SELL! SELL! SELL!".  
I wish I could enjoy the moment when everyone will be like "Damn.. I shouldn't have sold everything :(", but I can't. I don't wish bad things to happen other people and I want to share the success with other people, but when other people don't have trust.. it's hard to do.

That's it. The argumentation like "it is too nice to be true", "something can't success this much", "you can't use virtual things as money" etc. are no arguments at all. You can't just plain say things like that, because all your past experience with VERY naiv things didn't came true.  
Crypto Currency is not just a theory, but a very thought up and nice concept that is live and slowly integrating into our life. What we can say is normal is that we can't replace normal money with crypto currency within a few month. It will take some years until everyone gets into it and the companies starting to work with them.  
The only thing I would love is if we somehow implement some strategies to stop this goddamn wannabe pumpers. It's annoying and I am sure that not less are successing.  
Something like that a single user can't influence the rates more than a specific amount every x Week.  
Like if a Whale is buying a billion crypto currency the prices shouldn't jump like crazy. It should go up a little bit and next week it should go up again until the amount he bought reached.

For what I read what people do with they children at 18+ (or sometimes even earlier), reading that you pay for your son that high amount, makes me happy.  
Thank you for beeing a good dad and human beeing and not a greedy old egoistic savage.

Wow! Congratulation. I have the hope that someone will donate me something too, I would even work for that like I don't know. The two things I can do very good are gaming and (mostly Web) Development. But 1) find someone who needs this work 2) Someone who wants that deal 3) Don't sound like one of the annonying and weird beggers which I probally already failed with this comment (I hope I didn't)  
Overthinking it I find it amazing that your work was worth her like ~14k dollars. That's amazing!

Seems like "XXX stole my bitcoins" threads starting to happen. I think we shouldn't try to centralize our decentralized currency on a plattform, but store it on our own wallet.

In Germany they are like slowly increasing something that's like 30€ to 60€ with ~2€ steps.. then they sell it for 45€ with "SOMMERSCHLUSSVERKAUF!! SOGAR IM WINTER! WTF?!"
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:08:05
You invested. You got your investion. There is no shame.  


Yes, but you could lose everything too. Let's take me. I was too lazy to "save" my ETC private key on a other source than my desktop. My HDD crashed. It was "Just" 10 ETC (luckly saved my BTC on multiple platforms with multiple "high security" passwords,.. maybe should even move it to a paper wallet), but damn it's still ~200-300€.  
Or something else could happen. You could buy you a goddamn house (hopefuly you also calculate the costs for the property and additional costs that comes with a house). What else do you want? A fast car, alcohol, bitches? Damn, let's be humble. A house is more than many can even effort before late 50's.

I read that in Germany you dont Need to pay if you dont sell it for 1 year After buying. But thb I dont trust this. I will pay a So called "Steuerberater" So I am on the safe side.

Just want to Remind everyone that it takes One little mistake and you are in big trouble. They dont Care if you tried your best. On Paper it says you made a mistake and that a Penalty has to be done.  
If you know what you do then it's perfectly fine! I wish you many millions!
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:43:14
Oh my god.. I really understand that loosing the opportunity of having like 6-15k BTC while it's +10k$/BTC is something that would make me mad as fuck too,.. but that this would make him so much trouble that he kill himself is way too much.   
I mean.. it's just money. Everything is like always, just that you won't have the easy way of life. It sucks in 24 different dimensions, but well.. it's a partial gamble with BTC.  
I could buy tons of BTC back when it was like ~10$ too, but I didn't (mostly because I was poor that days, but also I was too scared) and todays I am banging my head to the wall. There is nothing much that I would make different in my life, but maybe this one little difference.  
Who knows maybe it would get hacked or I would lost the details? Maybe it's fate? I know some BTC adresses that contain BTC worth millions in it and I see how they probally got hacked and now systematically get moved around in the hope that you can't follow them back.. and I wish there was a method to hack them, but there isn't.   
I see other people becoming millionairs with BTC.. literally spending their BTC to charity, because they have more than enough.. yes, it's a inner pain, mixed with envy.  
Still I live my life like always. I go to work, come home and have fun in my free time.  
Also I give my best to find a method to earn BTC somehow :O  
I am sorry for your brother. I hope noone else falls into this hole.  
If in any case someone reading this who feels themself to do suicide, please consider either speaking with a therapist or if I can give you my ear.. I am always open to help!

You mean 50x600$ = 30.000$ for BTC? This person deserves every $ he makes with it. Going in such a high risk and becoming successful.. I would defend him in every discussion. Back then I probally wouldn't had the guts to buy 50 for $600.  
Why people without any knowledge taking words in their mouth where they don't have a clue about? Like "bubble". Yea, in the world of shares, there are many bubbles. Also bubbles come from things where people think "hey, I am sure everyone will love this" and then noone does love it.  
Can this be true with Bitcoin too? Well, maybe. But there is a good chance that Bitcoin have a healthy future and as long as it goes on (and it will go on for at least a couple of years) you should try to be part of it.  
If it fails, it will fail in a couple of years. If you can't HODL enough, then try HODL at least 1-2 years of it, so you can make a good profit out of it.   
Just because there is a chance that a train is going to hell, it doesn't mean that it could bypass heaven before ;)

@_date: 2017-12-11 08:53:41
Do you really need everything of that? It's ok if you payout a big bunch, but if you don't need everything, you probally should think about buying a few back (even if you lose some value) and "HODL" a bit, so you can make even more out of it.  
P.S. Damn, you really successfully mined and forgot about it :D

So this could completly change Steam's negleting of Bitcoin, because of the high costs?  
Removing the high costs and duration time will make BTC even more famous. A several part of people who ignored BTC for this reasons could completly change their mind.  
This "should" increase the rates even more (if I understood the rate system correctly).  
Any bets when 100k will be reached? Or are we still at 1k steps hype?   
By the way: I didn't added question marks, but I hope that if I am wrong at some point, someone will be nice and correct me or at least say at which part I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:34:39
Could be, I don't know how "50 at $600" is meant in native English. In German grammar, we would say "50 Stück bei einem 600 Euro Kurs" (50 pieces at a $600 rate).

Can we please make this as  Rule not only for Bitcoin, but for everything that has to do with media? So we stop becoming more and more stupid and hateful on this planet, screaming "terrorist!!" at a Spanish couple and attacking with a bat (yes, that indeed happened).  
.  
\ is harcore.. The only time I would do this if I could buy NOW a timemachine and go back, because I know that Bitcoin will become at least ~20k $ rates one day. But since we don't have this technology now, doing this is extremly ~~stupid~~ irresponsible. (\*edit\*: wait.. maybe this guy has a timemachine!!)    
.  
\ To prevent this thinking I would give you all the tip to go into the mindset that.. at the exact same time where you bought Bitcoins, no matter how much, the exact price you paid is actually a LOSS for you. Yes, think about you already lost the money. You don't own it anymore. You own Bitcoins, but not the money. Yes, we give Bitcoins a value and it can be sold, but UNTIL we didn't successfully sold it and your bankaccount says "You got xx.xx$ +", the amount you have is 0$ and you lost the costs for that Bitcoin.  
This way there is no loosing. You have nothing to lose. Yes, the Bitcoin value can drop, who cares? You will sell that in 2 years. If it becomes 20$/Bitcoin again then you will sell it for 20$/BTC. And at this stage you will actually have a winning! Yes, you had nothing and just won something!  
The moment I decided to invest money into BTC, I also accepted that I probally never ever will see that money again. Yes, I hope to become wealthy, but I still know that there is this little chance.. the little, tiny, itsi bitsi percent that there could happen anything unforseen like in Half Life 2 with Dr.Prof. .. wait, I shouldn't spoiler.  
So knowing that there is always a chance in anything I do that it could go in the wrong direction in life.. well, what should I do? I only can accept it and try preventing it as much as I can.  
I can't do much at BTC's, because I have no influence about them. But I have influence about the amount of money I "invest" in them. It's the amount that I could live to lose without diving into financial problems. I really wanted to buy for 1000€'s more, but that would be a high financial risk for me (maybe any goverment wants money? Maybe something happens and I need that money? One time I got a letter from health insurance and they wanted 1400€ from me for the past month.. have fun paying that without savings that I luckly had made!), so I didn't bought more.  
The best tip is: Be smart, not emotional.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:23:17
I really hope it falls to 10$ so I can buy a million, wait and get rich. Btw. "richer" means you are already rich? Wise man! I was fool enough not to get on the boat when it was waving to me.

This could be me if I had enough money when Bitcoin costs around 20$ back then when I couldn't even buy a bus ticket to reach the customer.. and of course if I had the balls to do so.  
Congratulation in succeeding man!

Yea I bought 0,036 at ~2000€, then at ~3300€ and now at ~2600€. I am not at approx. 0.3, but want to buy more when they reach the limit where it will go up again. For this I need to watch very closly "when this will happen".  
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:25:17
When this happens, you can bet that I will buy as much as possible.. but I am pretty sure it won't fall that much. Maybe 2k~ and then go up again. Maybe it drops even more, but 100$ would be a dream!
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:05:47


Thumbs up for your trust in the future! I hope the scared bunnies don't ruin it and make you a even more happier human beeing.  
I also hope that I can afford me a house too. There are so many things I would love to do if I just had the room for it. In my current room I can't even buy a new PC table, because I literally have no room for it.  
Travel the world.. does that mean you will go everywhere where someone can think of? That's a huge plan! I hope you are well prepared :-)  
If you ever met South Korea please tell me how cool it is there so I can get hyped even more if I visit it in 1 or 2 years (if nothing crosses that plan).
