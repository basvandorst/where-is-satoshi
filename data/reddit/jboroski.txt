Paypal from Paxful. You can check other payments they have and choose whichever is convenient for you. They use an escrow for your safety.

I totally agree with you. I use the same thing like yours. It's the Paxful support who taught me.

I used my credit card to purchase bitcoin online because I had the same problem. Whereas credit/debit card, Paypal are instant and no hassle.

Paxful is one of the best places to buy and sell bitcoins. It is safe because they use an escrow and they have 24/7 support.

Each trader in Paxful has different requirements. Some require to submit an IDs but most are just an image of the physical cards. When you sign up with Pax, you'll be able to see what each of the traders requires. You can trade with a trader that doesn't require an ID. Pax uses an escrow. they hold the trader's wallet if they did not release the payment or bitcoin which is safe for both parties.

I don't think Paxful is a scam. Because I'm one of the traders and haven't had any bad experience. I first check the trader's reputation before I trade. and make sure that my trades are being recorded all the time. If in case one of the traders scammed me, I have the proof to provide to Pax Admins

GCs are best to buy at Paxful. Traders have a different exchange rate. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:11:15
.0008 miner's fee from Paxful is a good rate for a newbie like me. Similar site miner's fee I got was .0004 So Paxful is higher so far.
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:46:17
Thanks for the info. This is helpful. I'm a newbie trader in Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:25:21
No with LBC. Will still remain with Paxful. Similar sites don't offer like the ones with Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:49:58
Go with Paxful my recommendation. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:50:00
It is easy to write articles about people's stories and post it anywhere on the internet whether good or bad. Lots of scammers anywhere not only with Paxful. I had an issue with a trader in the past thru Paxful but they were able to resolve the issue because I provide them the screenshots as my proof of our conversation. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:10:16
I record my transaction every time I trade with Paxful. I use screencast to document my trades. Whatever happens in any cases, I have the video to provide as my proof.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:17:27
Totally agree with you. People can write false stories anywhere else on the internet. I still believe in personal experiences rather than hearsays. I trade in Paxful and haven't had any bad experience.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:48:31
I am one of the Paxful vendors. e use escrow to do the trade. No issues I'd encountered so far. All GCs I'ved purchased was legit.
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:28:45
Sorry to hear that! I've been with Paxful turning 1 year almost but never had that bad experience. I read everything in Pax help pages, watch their video tutorials and read their forums. I make sure that I am up-to-date and learning from different traders. I am happy with Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:25:07
Is there any way I can check if the card has been redeemed before I pay? I am a newbie in Paxful and still learning.
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:54:49
Paxful they use escrow that is safe for you. They also offer good rates. Register for free and start your trade.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:39:50
Paxful accepts other payment method. You can check to see which one works best for you..
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:25:29
Well, Consider that scammers are all over the place not only with Paxful. You can write anything on reviews isn't? I trade with Paxful and I haven't had any bad experience the first time I joined. I am very careful in doing my trades. I make sure that vendor has high or good reputation before I start my trade.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:00:01
Paxful is not a scam. Vendors that have high reputation charge more because they are reliable vendors without negative feedback or less. I had several trades with those vendors in Paxful and transaction was fast.
