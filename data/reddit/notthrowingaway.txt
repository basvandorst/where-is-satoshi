I'll buy at $50. Any sellers? I could really use the deal. :-P

Some major bad news recently (gox). I'm sure it is scaring people.

This confuses me. People could easily do both. Register on coinbase and get the instant buy verification. Whenever they spend coin, immediately rebuy. That way they're holding their coin and stimulating bitcoin.

I didn't miss the point you were *trying* to make. The fact is, it would be much easier to traffic this amount of money in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:45:29
Uh... I do the same thing but charge only 1 BTC. /s
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:16:07
I plan on buying BTC once I have money... so, never. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:10:32
Yup. 1. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:22:01
It is killing me to see these prices. I don't have the money to invest anything. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:34:49
Congrats! I'm still working on getting my first. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:47:10
Yes, but if you have to ask, then you can't afford it.

Now that it has been 5 months, have any of the PayPal transactions been reversed? 
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:25:42
Get a secured Visa card.

I'm a regular trader on localbitcoins.com, and scamming is out of control there. I buy BTC using PayPal, but I absolutely refuse to sell to a person using PayPal. 
People will do a cash deposit in person at a bank for $5,000, the seller will release the coin and the guy will go do a reversal. It took me a while to get into trading and I made sure to do a lot of homework beforehand. Bitcoin, unfortunately, isn't user friendly, yet.

Came here to say exactly this. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks it. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 06:55:13
It will get confirmations eventually. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:45:14
 I have .3 BTC. I wish it were 2 BTC right about now as I could sure use it 
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:59:08
I have none to spend. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:37:40
Soooo, my password of 82 characters is overkill?  
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:54:28
Neither are safe for the seller.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:45:10
Netflix is my guess.

Except, you know, he didn't have anywhere near 2x the market cap of BTC.

If you use the first week of numbers for a business to see how they're going to do... you're in for a world of hurt. Of course they're going to get a ton of sales their first day and week.
