Also, bear in mind that it rarely goes unnoticed that there's a suspicious network activity happening, so I'm confident you should have some proof for your accusations. For example, opting out of Microsoft Windows 10 sync revealed there's still data being transferred. That, without doubt, must have happened on at very least one Intel or AMD CPU. This means somebody already checked network traffic and found traces of data being transferred to Microsoft's servers. If they were looking for a needle in a haystack, they should have also found evidence supporting your claim. Please link it here.

Well, Google doesn't rely on your classical switches and Ethernet, but uses its own in-house created mechanisms to enable much more efficient communication. What you're listing here is not something that would have gone unnoticed. 
Now there's more. Someone referred to redundancy. GCE has only as much redundancy as the customer configures and an instance cannot be killed because Google suspects CPU may be doing something fishy. There is something called "service level agreement" according to which your machine cannot be randomly turned off by Google. More than that - it cannot be even rebooted without your explicit action. 
Please post the source of your claims.

This makes a lot of buzz on the internet, but is also the only thread bringing such serious accusations. For example, for companies such as Google, Oracle etc., this would essentially mean killing entire deal with these manufacturers. And I mean _entire_, including whatever is currently in data centers. Intel and AMD would be sued for billions of dollars. Hence my question. 
Is there any actual investigation backing up your story, or is it just a promo article for Talos? Where do we find the evidence?

If these mechanisms were in place, the cost of shutting down machines would far exceed cost of operation. Redundancy is often n+2, which would be insufficient for this kind of spy junk to go through. This just wouldn't happen. 
If you're supporting these claims please link actual investigation confirming this. Your opinion is a separate matter; you can believe anything you want.

Excellent. All I'm asking is that you post the source of these facts. Right now it's just an unconfirmed rumor from where I stand.. please just post related research that confirms this.

Again, please post source.

If it is released as a bug, it should make it to official CPU papers. Also, it's a bit too big and too elaborate to be a bug. Intentional malicious software or hardware is not a "bug".
