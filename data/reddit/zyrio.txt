Looks like blockchain.info needs a lawsuit. Unbelieveable if they really had these problems for so long and didnt act.
Maybe backup your phone. Im not sure if you need the phone rooted to be able to back up all settings too. But with the rising amount of victims it could be that enough people come together to make a lawsuit.

Did you have a virus on the sending computer that changed your bitcoinadress you had in the clipboard ot the hackers one on the fly? Does not happen seldom unfortuantely.

You most probably can't. Bank account funds can be seized easily so the only thing they can refund would be the coins they still have.
Besides that, you put thoughts into it way too early. If it will be possible then they will tell. Useless to speculate now.

Yeah, wondering the same. I hope i sat up my stop loss correctly since i can't check now.
When my notebook came back from sleep okcoin tab told me i had a profit of 30%. But i think that's only a javascript on the page calculating it. I guess my future was closed in the meantime. If no im not happy.
Why didn't they warn before? They only show some chinese text which means something like Upgrade or so according to google.

The same daytime and the nonsaying twitter messages really look like an automated message only.
Is there any explaination about the change in content happening all the time? One time no connection, other time twitter.

It's an unknown address to chainalysis at least.

Wasn't there a trojan who changed bitcoin addresses that were in clipboard? Thats why you should every time carefully check the first digits, the last digits and maybe some digits in between when you use the clipboard and paste an address.
But like others said. Check the address on blockchain and see what other transactions are there connected. Maybe you find another address you recognize from somewhere. Or google them. Might help sometimes when its a publicly posted address.

What does it mean that it shows cloudflare and then the twitterpage randomly? Some servers affected, some not?
Looks like shadowserver took over btc-e.com.
