AMLD5 apllies to both online and offline trades. :P

I wrote "my opinion" and "one of the best" I didn't say it was the best. But which one would you say is better? I can only think of Electrum maybe because it has hardware wallet support. :P

The odds are against him, but I really hope his sentenced can get shortened one day. He made some "mistakes", but life in prison is way too extreme.

Both support BCash, being confronted with 2 bitcoin logo's is not very friendly for noobs. Blockstream Green is therefore a better option in my opinion.

Getting sufficient participants in a CoinJoin round takes a few hours max, but usually its very quick. In my opinion its one of the best wallets you can currently use. But probably best to just give it a try.

I think its called AML5 and it will eventually come to all exchanges in Europe.

Monero support dropped a lot after AlphaBay, Hydra (currently the biggest) is BTC ony for example. BTC can be private enough if used carefully and people just tend to use whatever is easiest.

True, but by default the lightning part in Blue Wallet is custodial and most people use it that way. :P
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:32:17
If you download there custom software, connect it to your LND node and connect that to Blue Wallet you are correct that it is not custodial.
But if you don't do that (which most people won't do) the Lightning part in Blue Wallet is fully custodial. :P
Its therefore better to use Breez
@_date: 2019-09-29 07:30:50
You should try Breez wallet with submarine swaps. ;)
@_date: 2019-09-29 08:49:01
Nop, thats Blue Wallet. :)
With Breez you have full control over your funds.

The price was increasing fast when the article was published, so that didn't help. :P
Either way lets hope people can convince the FATF before June to change the rule.

This would mean exchange A would have to share your personal data with exchange B if you don't send the bitcoins to your own wallet but directly to exchange B.
Would be insane if this actually gets implemented and a disaster for user privacy. :P

Are you using the latest Electrum version? [
