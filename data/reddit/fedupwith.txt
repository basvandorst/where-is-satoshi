From what I'm reading, if it's not denied by Monday, it's default approved.

You **MAY** want to wait a few weeks. And do what the top commenter said.

$0.07 per kw hr. So not bad.

Yeah...but it's western union...

Muy bueno. Hope those guys making the dongles are on the up and up, this whole bitcoin thing is still pretty new, confusing and anonymous to me. I hope they start shipping relatively soon.

At the point those USB miner come out, is there more profit potential in lite or Bitcoin? It seems litecoin has the room to grow, where bit could be reaching a peak as far as mining is concerned.

Ok, it get the option of using both CPU's instead, am I better off doing that or going through bitcoin proper?

Ok, follow up question. That USB processing dongle that was posted yesterday, could I pick up those when they become available and chain them on a hub?
Edit: My computer doesn't have to be 'useful' as much as I want it to earn enough bitcoin to purchase a dongle and expand from there. My electricity cost in the area is ridiculously low and I can run my computer headless and with minimal hardware for as long as need be. Hell, 1 bitcoin right now would buy 3 dongles @ $40, so that alone would be worth the cost.

Well, if I can make enough to have 10-20 dongles pay for themselves, it's reasonable to assume that over the course of time, the preceding generations of dongles will somewhat mirror the increase in difficulty, making it cost effective to replace them as time goes by while maintaining a profit.

Do you know any details about them, like how they interface with the bitcoin/guiminer software? Will it automatically detect them or is it going to need code written in or wait till a new version of the windows client?

Well, I'll see how much coin my jalopy can scour up till then. If I need to I'll throw cash at one and grow it from there. I'll be paying attention to the development, for sure.
