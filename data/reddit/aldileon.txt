I would recommend bitcoin.de for Europe!
It has realy low fees and is super easy for SEPA Transactions
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:44:58
Long term it is never to late to invest, but if you want profit in 2 Month it could be a bit late.
But if you could keep it up to 2 Years you will make more than 100% ptofit

Over unkown emails there is a button where you could enable picture download

Plottwist: Op is the hacker who stole the coins and wants r/bitcoin to validate his plan :D
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:43:36
No because of the trust level and also they have his Bank data, too. So it should not be to dificult to get the money back (or get the bitcoins, if you can show them a prove
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:18:11
Bitcoin.de is great and secure. And they are partnering with a german bank (Fidor) to offer faster bitcoin transactions in the future.
You can speed it up, by selecting only sellers of your own credit institute, then it should work in one day.

But the hash power seems to stay the same, because there are as much BU blocks mined than before: 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:15:38
But why are sites like  and  down with a 503?

There is not just "one" Price out there...
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:50:32
What? 42$ per Bitcoin?
I could see 90-100€ per bitcoin and it was never that low after the 200$ bubble
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:37:27
You have used that "," as a "." to mark 1k? 
Oft course not everybody in here is using bitcoins so heavily like you ;)
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:43:07
Bitminter.com has almost the same for their miners, but an desktop java applet
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:13:37
Just use a SEPA transfer to bitcoin.de and pay less than 0.1% --&gt; 50ct
@_date: 2013-05-05 20:12:07
Why just why?
What is when 1 Bitcoin is about 10.000 € ?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:59:20
Also 
It is like a loop. The first 2 Times i thought anyone is pumping money in the market, but this is no coincidence
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:09:38
You'd get my like if you do so :)
Nice idea!
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:16:50
Not for daytrading, but for private sales perfect
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:54:46
119$ ? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:35:24
But if those other excanges have each 25%, it would be much more complexe to ddos them and result in a variance of the exange rate 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:01:11
 503
 503
Even mtgox showed me a 503
I think it is obvious a ddos

Could anybody explain me this 0.0005 fee? My desktop client doesn't have this, but android does.
I know you need this fee to keep the network alive, but as a miner I am wondering if this fee also could be mined?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:20:16
0,0005 which is the minimum transaction fee
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:39:56
To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛ 
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:42:11
Is there a special setting while mining to get those transaction fees or are they added to the block amount automatically?
Are they registered per block (every 10 minutes) or every time you mine a transaction with fees?
in about 100 Years will be almost no new blocks. Then are only those fees. in order of this they have to go up because the miner need to pay their bills and otherwise the network will collapse?
@_date: 2013-05-07 13:30:18
Maybe 50% is too much, but 30+% safe

@_date: 2013-11-22 00:58:17
Maybe it is because newbes are almost forced to use bitcoin qt? 
"Look this is the best Client To start"
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:11:54
Otherwise it is great to see such an health system ;)
 has the same values
@_date: 2013-05-07 10:24:46
Ok and now? Is this merged with the 25BTC per block?
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:11:00
Energy cost ^^
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:21:14
I was thinking about exactly the same (y)
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:35:41
gox is also 305 USD
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:32:10
For example the android bitcoin app let you decide (after some settings) which amount you want to spend as a fee.
The custom value is 0.0005 Bitcoin
As I changed this once to 0.00001 my Botcoin transactions weren't included into the blockchain...
