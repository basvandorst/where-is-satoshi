continue to strengthen monitoring and prevention of the potential risks in wealth 
management products, bill businesses, and inter-bank transactions, and to prevent the 
spread to the financial system of the risks associated with the real economy in some 
regions, industries, and enterprises and risks arising from financing activities outside 
of the formal financial system.
basicly they want to prevent money from exiting or leaking out of their bubble of control

yet another confirmation biased retort:

maybe because i don't know... new?


bitcoins have virtually no friction, friction is bad, you just highlighted a strength of CC


you want market friction go fail to adapt with the rest of the bankers.  i hear there is a gigantic cc hater's circle jerk going.


again, cc is so new i would be suprised to see this aspect happen so soon


so is progress


yet another iq lowering rhetoric pretending someone implied no risk.  The reason Lincoln's greenbacks were so successful is because they were "real", not this debt backed inflationary shit we get now.


nobody ever said bitcoin was anonymous, and wtf is legal tender, not anonymous? you suck


hard to use is an invalid argument.  would you tell some poor family in Africa or wherever that they can't participate in the banking system by getting a checking account, because it's too hard?  If so then why don't they already? the answer: friction!, the shit that you love so much!


like fiat currency ever protected its users, talk about printing BILLIONS of dollars every month to feed the credit addicts.  what the fuck bro!  not to mention how much it gets counterfieted, as opposed to BTC which can't be forged. it can't be corrupted or shaped by outside influences, unlike central banking.  "scammers"  will exist everywhere, this argument of yours is cringe worthy


do you have a source to back up your claim?


so demerit the next best thing since the telegraph, because of energy costs that some people volunteer to run the infrastructure?  besides that eventually it will be so hard to mine the last few remaininng coins that it won't even be worth it and they'll reduce that energy cost over time, but this is just a guess of mine, regardless, this is the least bad argument but still bad

the ip address used to announce a transaction is logged by third parties like blockchain.info
as we know your true ip address is damning evidence as LE can subpoena your ISP for their logs to see who was using that IP address at that time.  but lets not kid ourselves, the NSA already has real-time access to that info, as the legal process was probably too pesky for those guys.

BTC makes only a mathematical promise that elliptic curve cryptography can accomplish.  This is how it minimizes trust.  THIS is what gives it value. 
the value is that trust is a non issue when dealing with BTC.  Take that and speculate whatever you want, but don't try and say you were promised anything other than what ECC brings to the table.
