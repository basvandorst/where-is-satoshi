who knew you had to have a phd in math to understand that stocks go up after they go down, like what happened over and over again with bitcoins in the past. but i'm sure bitcoins is done for now, it will crash completely and never rise again. /s

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:15:06

@_date: 2017-11-28 15:04:34
