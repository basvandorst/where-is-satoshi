Westlake Mall has a Bitcoin ATM by the bank entrance. I think you could rock up to that and walk away with cash. You'll probably have to scan your ID in first.

The margins and affiliate payouts on airfare are nonexistent. OTAs, comparison sites, etc don't make money off flights. Airlines barely make money on them.
But hotels and other travel expenses have fantastic margins - so affiliates can do awesome stuff like this.

Our Reddit sidebar ad saying "Magical Internet Money" may not have helped quash that thinking....

Thanks for chiming in. I have great lawyers, and a bunch of other people are here saying "there's no way this is possible." I've waived child support for the period that I'm paying alimony.
Lol, way more possible than they believe.

My son is amazing, I'm a bit in shock that she did this. When she made the offer, I described it to my lawyer as my "second worst outcome" - I was trying hard to find a way for him to have both parents regularly in his life.
But the reaction from my lawyers and friends has all been "If she was able to even think about making this offer, she shouldn't be a full-time parent."

It's going to be very tight. :( But I can make more money. There's only one of him.

Lol, no - he's still a good friend.

I told her I would give her the coins and let her deal with it, but she wanted me to deal with it and send her the money. So there wasn't really much motivation for me to stress about doing extra work to minimize the fees. She's getting whatever they sold for.
And I still have to pay the capital gains on them. :'-(

I bought into Bitcoin in 2011, while a friend was staying with my new wife &amp; me for a few months. The friend &amp; I talked each other into it, so with put a bit of cash into this crazy new thing.
Since then, the friend went on to do amazing things, my wife &amp; I had a wonderful son, and now I'm in the middle of divorce.
Since we separated, we've been co-parenting our son, and he's been spending time with each of us every week while we figure out the long term plan. My soon-to-be-ex said that she has no interest in continuing to co-parent, and wanted to move, with him, to a different country. I was obviously not on board with him &amp; I being cut out of each others lives, so I suggested I would move as well. She said that she wasn't going to accept us co-parenting together in *any* country.
Then she suggested that I could have full custody, as long as I gave her all our savings, all my Bitcoin, and \~50% of my salary for the next three years.
This was a truly crazy deal, and I jumped at it. She'll be taking all the cash and disappearing soon, and I'll be left with my amazing kid.
When I bought into BTC early on, I was hoping to make a bunch of money. I never imagined what I was going to end up with.

Can you believe we didn't work out? And yes, it's all in a legally binding contract.
Though while it's binding, we having filed the court version yet, because she's trying to negotiate for some more money before we do that...

I'm going to wait for 6 confirmations.
