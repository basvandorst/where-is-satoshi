Purple and white is a lovely combination; I've painted a room the same. Anyways, it would be nice to see some controls added for more adjustments to the buy parameters, especially since Coinbase isn't a full-fledged trading platform. Some people come over  to CB and wonder where the stop/limit orders are.  If Lawnmower executes an order once $4.00 in change has accumulated (minimum order due to coinbase's fee), will it be feasible for lawnmower user's to customize when their accumulated change is utilized? 
For example: 
buy bitcoin with accumulated lawnmower balance if ____ , 
50% of accumulated balance if ______, 
10% of balance on Tuesdays, 
I didn't expect your service to work with major banks so quickly and am both surprised and very much excited at the potential. 
I'm wondering what a mixture of Lawnmower.io and something like IFTTT, or a Raspberry Pi can produce. 
A physical, buy-it-now button would be fun to have on my desk. Pressing the button and executing an order for bitcoin, watching that tx get processed, sent to my wallet, then looking and waiting for confirmations..., with all the neat blockchain visualisations that are in development, watching grass grow is going to be a lot more fun than watching paint dry, as long as I have a cool Lawnmower doing cool things.
Making the process of a purchase as interesting as the purchased good itself. Is it possible? Less like Mint, more like Magic Mountain?
Well, I have a feeling ya'll are going to surge in popularity within an iteration or two, and wish you luck and success.
p.s. Slow the gif down a bit or add an extra second or two to the Settings slide, it's text heavier than the others, and least familiar to us, your potential new users. Cheers.

My favorite part was when OKcoin said their lawyer was using Google translate to review contract details. 
One of the biggest companies in the bitcoin ecosystem can't afford a bilingual lawyer? A professional translator? 
Google translate... FFS!

Fits in line with the ETA of the next mining era.

[1] Someone else already got rich off of it, so it must be "too late" for me. The easy money is gone, so is my happiness.

Let's see how much time DEA agent Carl Mark Force IV and Secret Service agent Shawn Bridges receive for their efforts.

IIRC, final tally altogether was in the $3k range. Not a bad return for a comment.

the last auction showed us that syndicates are participating. One bid can be made on behalf of an unknown # of investors. 14 bidders... 14 million people? We dont know.
