It's 100 bucks of coins I bought as a joke, it's not worth the effort it would take to move them to something more secure

A currency just represents value, its easier to trade a couple of bucks then a couple of chickens. So if you were to replace currency with something more convenient, more secure, or cheaper for the right people (ie the fed gov) to produce, while still being limited in supply, you have basically just replaced currency with better currency

Again, rough numbers, the exact time I bought was at the tip top of the peak and I sold at the very bottom of the dip
