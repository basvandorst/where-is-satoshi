I'm browsing through your comment history to try and tell if you are for real, and I want to say that you are. I can't even fathom having 30k bitcoins to sell. Props to you man. I'll keep holding the couple coins I have and waiting.

We've been in a downtrend for a little while now. This was compounded over the last days (weeks?) with someone(s) who wanted to sell a large number of bitcoin and/or manipulate the market. This pushed the market down further until it culminated with a huge ~30k BTC wall at $300 that was eventually bought up.
Why are we in a downtrend? That's the golden question. You will probably get 50 different answers. Anything from USD rally, to Bitcoin overvalued, to Bitcoin dieing, to it was all manipulation.
Are the someone(s) who are selling large amounts of BTC/manipulating the market done? Will we reverse into an uptrend? Nobody knows.

all my coins came from mining alts and selling those for BTC. I'm hoping to use those coins to pay off my CC debt if/when we bubble up again. I wish I had the spare capital to put into more BTC... 
Your statement does have me thinking though.

No. You pre-load it with fiat by basically selling BTC at whatever the exchange rate is at the time you pre-load it.
So your card is empty, you sell .5 BTC for say $200 and now have $200 available on the card.
So it works similar to say coinbase, but on a stand alone card instead of transferring to a checking account or similar.

My wife somewhat understands it, although is more interested in the cashing out into fiat side of things. She is however, interested in potentially accepting bitcoin for her business (natural childbirth education) which is mostly woman dominated

Grr.... I won't even have the .03 coin I bought last Saturday by 11/29....

argh, still waiting on my freaking coinbase order from Saturday. It won't even let me put in a second order for more coins until the first one fulfills... expected Dec 2nd.
FUUUUUUUUUUU
