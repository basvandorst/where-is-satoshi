Well I guess so if I don't believe that economists at the BLS are manipulating price indices. Thanks for the laugh.

Decentralize all the things. No benefits from centralized control. none.

Yes. You should be stocking up on supplies. The end is near.

You obviously don't understand the differences between the two, so maybe you should learn some economics anyway. Plenty of time if you're young.

What if I think the price will be between $0 and $500? Or between $5000 and $10000? Or anywhere between your options?  That question is poorly designed. Make it open ended and then bin the results.

How do you think companies invest to develop technology and build their business? Cover payroll? How do people buy houses and large durables purchases? Debt itself is not bad.

I don't think everything should be centralized. I also don't think everything should be decentralized. Both have pros and cons and are extremely situation dependent.  I also don't think I'll be 3d printing my computer, tv, couch, car, microwave, shirt, etc anytime soon.

Yes. Then I would find another bank. But I don't own or intend to buy bitcoin so that's nothing I have to worry about.
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:55:17
The Treasury and Fed know who buys securities. These are reports straight from those institutions. Or you can continue to ignore reality.

Hello sir. Please go read the documentation on how the BLS calculates CPI. Also, CPI is not the only measure of aggregate price levels. There are  actually a variety of measures. Thanks
Edit: Just because I'm so nice, here is the official documentation.

No nonononono
decentralization (whatever that even really means) solves all the world's problems.

Don't you think that the statisticians and economists have considered these critiques before? They are want a good estimate. This is in fact why the update their methodology. 
Peter Schiff also said we'd have hyperinflation right now. That guy is a moron.

He is thinking about the "data" from shadowstats which literally just adds a constant to the official data (seriously:  Quote from shadowstats idiot: "I’m not going back and recalculating the CPI. All I’m doing is going back to the government’s estimates of what the effect would be and using that as an ad factor to the reported statistics."

There's plenty of woods dude. Also, if you don't pay taxes, please stop using any government services and any products or services that have or had any government involvement at all (..so you should probably get off the internet). Thanks

As far as I know, European countries use very similar methods. And if you have a variety of measures that are consistently saying the same thing, then they are most likely pretty accurate. Not perfect, but pretty close. It's ok to admit it.

They do use real price data. There is a huge number of people whose job it is to go to stores and collect price data. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:54:24
Sourcing inputs on a large scale vs small-scale is not cost effective. Having people work together in an enclosed space to produce goods has positive returns because of knowledge transmission.

But that doesn't affect your bank balance. It's OK to admit that there are a whole lot of issues with scams, fraud, and hacking. The only thing you'll lose by admitting that is maybe some points from delusional enthusiasts.

And the Treasury found out. I'm not sure what your point is. This article talks about years previous to 2012 which is when the data I cited is from. Could they be underreporting still? I guess. But then they'd still be in the range of ~7-15% if we assume they hold double than reported. Which is not the same thing as China having the US government bought and paid for.

All data for June 2012:
Chinese holdings of US Treasury securities: 1,138 billion (page 9 - "Foreign Holdings of U.S. Securities by Country of Holder" 
Total public debt: 15,855 billion (page 42 - "Estimated Ownership of US Treasury Securities" 
so ~7% at June 2012. Also "China" means Chinese investors, which is not the same thing as the Chinese government.

I understand the use of propaganda. I also just don't believe that inflation statistics and price data is collected and either 1) manipulated by economists with PhDs or 2) collected, managed, then manipulated by people hire up. The BLS posts its methodology clearly on its website (edit: the actual article addressing misconceptions regarding the CPI, for example: 
So you just trust a random person on the internet (who is discredited by actual economists) *because propaganda* is also a little bit silly. 
Let's also remember that you have your own anecdotal evidence of price changes by actually observing prices in your daily life. There isn't any runaway inflation.
But I doubt I will change your mind or you change mine, so again, thanks for the laugh. That's what I came here for.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:57:37
Close to 0 is my guess. Bitcoin is too complex to get into for the average computer user. Plus the average person, if they have even heard about Bitcoin, most likely have a negative opinion due to the largely negative stories in the media.
