I do agree that bitcoin has never really functioned well as an actual currency, more so as an asset.
Forgive me, im still in my infancy of learning coding and more in depth understanding of what goes on under the hood for these things.
Does it offer a more sustainable solution, in terms of becoming a viable medium of exchange, than a coin built from the ground up with scalability in mind? Obviously we can't really *know* that beforehand...but what is your opinion and why?

The automobile industry has moved onto fuel economy and safety but people still drive classic cars.
I can appreciate your perspective, even if its a bit more pessimistic than my own

Really interesting analogy! My post is intended to create discussion and not rooted in any sort of fanboyism. I'm sick of all the sports team mentality arguments about cryptos in the sphere when were watching the transformation of economic principles and technology take place before our eyes...i really wish we could just stop and appreciate its scope without turning it into a cryptocurrency dick measuring competition. 
History isn't gonna care about these flavor of the week altcoins. Which is where i think using my research of the dot com boom of the 90s as a case study for this phenomenon has really helped provide some perspective.

Well, in theory, bitcoin is all of that, and when lightning network happens, obviously it may change things.
But, in practice, in its current state, it doesn't offer a itself as a viable means of small dollar volume transaction, even though it potentially one day *could*.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:35:41
You are correct. Sorry, I think what I meant when I said that was that it has never really been embraced as an actual currency on a large scale. 
I didn't mean that wasn't capable before all the demand showed up!
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:56:05
I want to know if I'm understanding you correctly. Do you think bitcoin shouldn't scale because the whales are an inherent problem with its ecosystem and you would prefer the coin die off?
Forgive me if I'm inferring incorrectly.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:43:17
I think decreased market dominance is to be expected as the sector grows as a whole and isn't necessarily a bad thing. 
But thats exactly my point, btc has kinda proven it doesnt need to function as a medium of exchange to retain its value. Atleast for now, because it never really has, yet it continues to appreciate 
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:09:08
You have an interesting perspective. Honest question, if you don't think bitcoin should scale, what should its intended purpose be? When i first started learning about it I was immediately drawn to seeing its potential as a medium of exchange...but i see that less and less now and see it more as a store of value. 
A more viable means of exchange will be built on a scalable, highly liquid system...but I still believe bitcoin will continue to appreciate regardless.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:28:03
I feel like you're really downplaying some of my points here...is it that hard to believe that a bottleneck in trading volume creates volatility that is attractive to investors?
 Serious question, why does a growing altcoin market have to mean the death of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:37:36
Market cap has been shrinking at a costant rate for months? What?
We just shattered new all time highs month after month, I'm not sure what you mean.
The past what...week and a half has been correction and consolidation that looks to be setting up for more upward momentum. 
Perhaps you meant to say market dominance? That seems reasonable that as the sector grows market cap willl begin to spread out, certainly doesnt herald the end of bitcoins growth or adoption.
My argument is primarily that scalable coins seek to solve a problem that hasnt really become a real genuine problem yet, because bitcoin isn't really an accepted medium of exchange in traditional financial instrastructure. That seems more suitable for an inflationary currency like XRP that has built in liquidity by design. Maybe it wont be XRP, but something like it.
My point is that bitcoin doesn't even need to scale to continue to appreciate, regardless of what the rest of the market does or how the tech evolves.

That's a hyperbolic example to help better illustrate gresham's law in comparison to something highly volatile like bitcoin. Obviously, gold isn't going to fluctuate that much, that quickly unless something is going very wrong, very fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:15:41
Right but thats where greshams law comes into play. I'm more inclined to pay for said pizza with the "bad money" ie the debased currency less likely to appreciate or hold its value. In this case, thats good old fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:15:45
Were not talking about extraneous situations here, were talking about fundamental economic principles. Of course, if fiat currency is entirely devalued gresham's law is no longer in play...it only applies to weak money with an established value.

I feel like you just used auto fill on your phone for this...
, but it was the last few days ago. the first one's a lot more to do it, but I think I have been in business for a while 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:38:26
Its not so much an issue for the individual purchaser as it is for the market as a whole. 
Why would I, (I being the consumer in this case) trade my gold coin (an example commodity) for a pizza, if i believe that gold coin could be worth double tomorrow.  On the flipside, why would I, (I being the business owner) trade my pizza for a gold coin if I believe that gold coin could be worth half as much tomorrow?
[Gresham's law]( and cryptocurrencies inherent volatility present problems for the market, for crypto as a commodity used as a vehicle for exchange, more so than its use as an asset.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:09:07
No. The point isn't that gold value is in flux, its that bad money (weak value store) will out circulate good money (strong value store).
You can't walk into a pizza parlor and pay for your pizza with a gold nugget, and for good reason. 
Also a perishable food such as a pizza is absolutely NOT a store of value. I can put a bar of gold in my closet and take out and liquidate it into cash 2 years from now. Try and do that with a pizza.

Dollar cost average my friend, all the smart money does it. 
Whether bitcoin goes to 4k or 40k you'll still hear the same thing from me. Buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:26:33
While I agree with you, do you think that people in this market...or maybe just people in general...often confuse facts they dislike with FUD?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:29:59
Why is this a problem? I get to buy cheaper bitcoin and MTGOX gets to make some money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:31:00
It gives me a pretty good feel for how the dumb money acts...but don't take what's said at face value, you have to read between the lines. 
Generally, the more euphoric everyone is, the more concerned I am...and the more fearful everyone is, the more aggressive I am.
The amount of money lost in the altcoin bubble of 2017 and how much mindless euphoria there was surrounding it is a good example.

I think fundamental analysis is a big part of it, yes, and I'd argue that's my biggest issue with purely technical traders, is that without the fundamentals, you can never get a fully accurate picture of what's taking place. 
But I'd argue that, while fundamental and technical understanding of markets is important, understanding of sound economic principles is much more so.

Really good points. 
It's funny, because while I don't think bitcoin is necessarily in a bubble in the sense that many financial experts wish us to believe...but I do think cryptocurrencies in general have been in multiple micro bubbles...particularly altcoins after the craziness we saw in november, december and january. 
The fundamentals, of course, are why were all still here buying and talking about this stuff...but the technicals look good too, as soon as the FOMO starts to get too out of control we have a correction...a mini bubble pop if you will...and we desperately need some of the chaff to be seperated from the wheat in the crypto market in general. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:55:37
Of course...but based on many of the conversations I had with regular people in the last few months in the crypto sphere...I get the feeling that many people let emotion take precedence over sound logic. 
Or atleast, it feels really similar to the way people talk about and bet on sports teams.
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:59:16
I already see that sentiment starting to ring all over the internet. Not just "bitcoin is dead" but "crypto is dead" I actually saw those exact words on a youtube comment not too long ago. Willing to bet many of them didn't even know what a "cryptocurrency" was until around november. 
I actually have both vol 1 and 2 of internet of money and mastering bitcoin on the way to me in the mail already, though I've probably already watched/read dozens of hours of AAs content. Really appreciate his work.

Also, I was pretty happy adding a substantially large amount of bitcoin to my portfolio when we touched 8k the other day. Felt confident about that price point for a multitude of reasons.
