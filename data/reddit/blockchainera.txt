That is amazing. I've been to Guiyang 2 years ago, even vegetable vendors on the street know gov is promoting big data. Guiyang is really a remote city compared with Shanghai. Such a bold and innovative move. China is really serious about Blockchain.

Why not breaking? there are bitcoiners and there are speculators. For China, the policy is greatly subtle. Whether Bitcoin can withstand the policy signal is a important test for it.

LOL. Good news. short-sellers, pure speculators who only use margin trading can go way. PBOC had better set some license system then Bitcoin trading will be much more safe.

It's some media that should be responsible for the FUD instead of PBOC or government. PBOC's rhetoric is quite moderate if you see the original announcement. 8btc's translation that "PBOC began to carry out on site inspection"is professionally correct. it means it's a continuing inspection involving communication, negotiation, compromises and warning etc. Chinese are really subtle. When gov say it is "investigating", it means it's highly likely there are problems. When gov say it is "raid" or "crackdown", it means gov has long got enough evidence  to order the suspension of exchanges. The selection of English words are also important in this case.

 China has more concrete supports to blockchain tech company. Though I am always wondering whether these company can finally bring real stuff that transforms the community. But the article said the company of block chain that has gained gov grants can connect  banks' information silos, isn't it something R3 is also donging? Glad to hear China's dynamics.
