Nice try, Ross.

Source?

It really is funny rat you pretend to have no fault here...  A bank would do the exact same thing. Grow up and pay your debts
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:39:50
How will we buy these? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:57:21
Ahhhh ok I jumped the gun a little bit there then. But still! Beware of banks, they also suck. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:48:52
I get it now. Today was the first time I'd ever seen a BTC tip, probably because they're more valuable.  Doge community seems built on tipping
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:40:00
Awesome! Just getting started with btc so it's all news to me
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:08:47
What's btc-e?

@_date: 2014-06-13 03:11:21
H-h-holy shit.....
You guys... Buy more bitcoins than I do. Like thoooousands of times more
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:16:10
No, because they accepted the bit coins in the first place, solidifying the fact that at least at THAT point they had value
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:44:41
No, actually. They use these methods to show you that the hand/spin was known beforehand. That in no way ensures a fair system, as you have no idea if the method of arriving at the result was "random." Also, there is no way to prove they are not lying.
(Sorry if this violates the rules of the sub,) but what sites do you use? Satoshibet is what I've used most recently
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:15:13
Just no.
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:55:46
No,  it's not.

what about mining other types of cryptocurrencies like doge/litecoin? Couldnt he just start mining whatever is trending or would the graphics card needs differ depending on which one he was going for?
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:14:22
7% of a real currency is insane you idiot 
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:24:15
Haha OK... I've only heard of tax arbitrage (borrow $ tax free, invest it at preferential rates, thusly making $) and I didn't know what this was in reference to
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:39:25
Thx. Working now... 1gh/s! So happy :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 23:35:01
thank you! how do I accept this?  I have a wallet on my phone
edit: i think i got it
@_date: 2014-05-26 23:19:22
I didn't know this was like doge! Do other cryptos also have tip bots?
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:03:44
Whoosh to me.  What's going on?
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:55:18
Just put all your money in okcoin 
Aaaand it's gone.

Pshh guys the crime involved bitcoin so he's not rly a criminal amirite???
@_date: 2015-03-28 08:51:32
N00B here...  Can someone explain to me what's going on? What's the significance of the seal? Does the USB have bitcoin on it? Why would you buy bitcoin in a physical device? What does the seal represent? So many questions
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:50:26
That is flat out incorrect. 
I don't get why people on this sub blindly support him... 
And look up the definition (LEGAL definition)  of entrapment; that did not occur. 
Ulbricht is a bad, bad, human being, regardless of his association to bitcoin and the silk road. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:14:40
Illegal ones. 
With butt-stuff. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:12:05
Dear God, you really have been brainwashed. 
I'll agree that I dislike the govt but that's as far as I'll go. 
And no. Saying that a person is ratting you out/stealing from you/anything else is NOT entrapment when it leads you to call a hit on someone.
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:59:22
I'm sorry, but who cares? 
Obviously they were against the war on drugs. Obviously they were for silk road. 
And as they are ignorant and biased, of course they support Ulbricht. (For those who didn't know, his eventual arrest was due to his attempt to solicit a hitman to murder his closest business partner...) 
@_date: 2015-03-30 13:49:11
You don't know or understand the legal definition of duress. 
The amount of ignorance in this thread is astounding
Edit: look guys, downvote me millions of times if you're butthurt for some reason, but this is in NO WAY "duress." 
If you think plea bargains and the like are made under "duress"  then you truly don't know what it means. Not only do you have a choice, you have a lawyer to advise you on your decision, you have time, you have no threats or physical pressure against you...
And the definition aside; anyone who has worked in the legal field will tell you that this guy got lucky as anything when his sentenced got reduced by 28(!) years. You realize the prosecutor didn't have to allow that? He could have gone to trial, lost, and gotten 15x his current sentence.
Im done replying here, but I hope your downvotes were just bandwagoning on the already negative comment; I'm sure most of you don't truly believe this would suffice in a duress claim against the proceedings. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:51:03
Kk enjoy supporting a murderer 
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:15:21
I call you brainwashed because you live Ulbricht so much that you're ignoring the fact that he attempted to have multiple people killed. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 07:12:36
Van someone Epson to me ask if these images with these containers and seals being broken? 
Sorry I'm a noob I'm just totally lost 
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:56:10
Legal definition = definition = what the words actually mean. 
You cant just make up your own definition and pretend some fascists are redefining words under our noses...  The word exists and has a widely accepted definition both in common law and local statutory laws. 
Take of the tinfoil hat, go read a book, or both. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:36:38
Lol. Just lol. 
Take off the tinfoil hat. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:58:27
OITNB is one of the worst depictions of a prison I have ever seen. 
What, there's maybe 6 guards total? 
The prisoners (female, might I add) basically run the entire prison. Gtfo

Lol we live in the most lenient non-legal marinara country in the world and you complain....  I assume your young because we are making incredible progress in this country to move towards decriminilazation/legalization

He wasn't directly threatened, he was scared. 
Then he went to contact what he thought was a hitman, but was actually an undercover agent. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:52:09
Lol ok man, believe what you want. 
Either take off the tinfoil hat, or read up on what actually happened. 
And FYI, it doesn't matter what your situation is. You can't solicit murder, idiot.   Even if it was some weird type of "self defense" scenario in your head (irl it was NOT)  the "threat had subsided" so no matter WHAT he was threatened with, he is liable for the (attempted solicitation of)  murder. 
If someone goes to punch you and you kill them, you are a murderer. 
Go read a book, and grow up.  Ulbricht should not be someone you look up to no matter how much you love cryptos. He is a bad human being. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:32:33
That's awesome. Federal laws can be a blessing and a curse I suppose 
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:24:14
Shit...  I dislike the point the guy above you is making, but ulbricht attempted to have someone assassinated (fact.) Attempted/accessory to murder is pretty bad as far as crimes go
