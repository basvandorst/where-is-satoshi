"If you move more than 10k dollar in cash around, you're considered a money launderer"
It depends what you mean by "move." If you withdraw $10,000 from the bank to buy a used car, does that make you a money launderer? What if your business makes tens of thousands in cash each day and you deliver that to your bank to deposit it in an account or safe deposit box? Does that make you a money launderer? Simply traveling with or transacting business in large amounts of cash is not illegal.
"civil forfeiture laws - they've been talked about everywhere: The cops can just take your cash if you carry around too much. They don't have to prove anything."
Your statement is misleading. The law does not allow police to permanently seize legitimate cash without proving it came from illegal sources. Take a look at the article below, which discusses a relevant case. A man was traveling with $10,000 of legitimate cash and police seized it. He fought the action in court and won his money back, plus $100,000 and attorney fees.

Keep an eye on this: 
Right now it's at 60,000 and rising. Transactions with low fees (like the one you are waiting to receive) won't get confirmed until the number of unconfirmed transactions goes way down. Check back in 12 or 24 hours.

That is a good question. In the US at least the burden of proving illegal activity falls on prosecutors. Not sure what the laws are where you live.

Whether or not it's absurd depends on how important it is to hide your bitcoin income from authorities. If you make your bitcoins from mining or legal trading and have no problem paying taxes on it, then you likely would not need to worry about using mixers, exchanging for cash, etc.
On the other hand, if the bitcoins come from highly illegal sources then exchanging for cash might not be so absurd. There are plenty of people finding bitcoin&lt;-&gt;cash trading partners on localbitcoins and similar sites.

If using mixers is risky in your country, then the wise thing to do would be to use tor to connect to a mixer that operates as a hidden service. If you do this your country's law enforcement is going to have a tough time a) knowing/proving that you're using a mixer, b) stopping you from using a mixer.

Based on your requirements I would suggest buying on localbitcoins using a gift card (Amazon, Walmart, etc.) Be prepared to get a bad exchange rate, though.
If you do go with Coinbase, do NOT send directly from there to a gambling site. Your account might be shut down. Send through a few intermediate wallets first, or though a mixer.

That's a different (though related) issue. My point is that utilizing tor to connect to hidden service mixers will prevent LE from determining that you are using a mixer based on their mass collection of everyone's browsing history via the cooperation of ISPs.
If you have unexplained large sums of money entering your bank account then that's a problem. For decades LE has used banking records to look for evidence of income from illegal sources.
If you have a large amount of bitcoin income that you want to convert to unreported but spendable dollars then it's best to stay out of the banking system completely. Meeting traders to exchange bitcoins for cash has its risks, but avoids the red flags that are raised by transferring big amounts from bitcoin exchanges into your bank account. That's how CaliConnect ended up on the fed's radar.

You can use localbitcoins.com to trade a gift card (Amazon, Walmart, iTunes, etc.) for bitcoins. Expect to pay 25% or more over the normal exchange rate, though.
