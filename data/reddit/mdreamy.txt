It can't have been a 1:1 hedge. There would be no point paying the interest. It just sounds as though it was liquidated. 
So OP had a short position. When you look at the charts from November 28, BTC went from 10k up to 11k, back to 9k and then right up to 16k by December 7. It's likely he got liquidated along the way.
It's likely support did not understand and thought you were doing 1:1 leverage, when you were doing 1:3. Why else would you hold a margin position?

Except the difficulty adjusts to ensure the available hashpower can still run the network. That's actually the wasteful thing about Bitcoin. More resources and electricity are used as the price goes up.

People are always talking about spending bitcoin to buy things. In this very sub, people have bought houses with bitcoin. So it is a medium of exchange. Most other crypto currencies can be valued in bitcoin. There is a site that has a BTC to lambo exchange rate, so BTC is also a standard of value. It meets all 3 requirements for a currency. A currency does not need to have a stable price by definition. You may not realise it, but your dollar value is also increasing and mainly decreasing in value every day, just at a smaller rate. 
I will agree that bitcoin is not being used as a medium of exchange for small purchases currently, but that is due to the fees. The fees weren't always this high and they are going to drop when the lightning network launches. 
Other currencies can work across borders, but international money transfers take longer than bitcoin and suffer more regulation. You can transfer money in 30 minutes or less with bitcoin. It's not instant, but pretty quick for the size of the transactions. Try taking more than $100k into the US and let me know how easy it is.
You say that people are hoarding it and that means it is not a currency, but that is exactly what people do when a currency is experiencing deflation. If it was under extreme inflation, they would be moving to spend it as quickly as possible like Zimbabwe dollars. In this case the deflation has been extreme. They hoard it because they think $1 of bitcoin today will be worth $2 tomorrow. That is due to the state of the market, but it does not prevent bitcoin from being a currency. 
I never said that other crypto-currencies aren't faster or better designed. There can be more than one crypto-currency.

Bitcoin is absolutely a currency. It's a currency by design - a peer to peer electronic cash system. You can earn it and you can spend it. But it is also an asset, similar to how you could say cash in the bank is an asset - it's not a liability. 
It's not being spent like a currency at the moment, because the fees are high and because of the rapid increase in value. It's Gresham's law. If you have an account with BTC and an account with USD, which are you going to spend? Spend the money that is increasing in value or the money that is decreasing? 
You are right that the demand for bitcoin comes from speculation, not current use. Speculation that in the future there will be even more demand for a world-wide electronic currency. A currency offering instant, immutable and cross-border trade that can occur without an exchange rate, without a bank or government intervention.
It will never collapse into nothing unless there are major technical issues or eventually better crypto takes over the market share.

It's going to crash badly at one point and they'll say "look it was a bubble." But they'll only be right for a year or so. 
It's like all the articles about Bitcoin's 20% crash (11,200 to 9,000). It only gained that 20% about 2 days ago.

It's like asking what is the price of a currency based on? It's relative to other currencies. If everyone in the world bought in, the market would be very different. There would be fewer speculators and the price would be less volatile. The price would based on the total number of people that want to store their wealth in a secure, low return investment. How many people want to store their wealth in USD or Japanese Yen. Lots.

It's not comparable with Walmart or Coca-Cola, because in traditional investment markets, you are looking at hundreds of different companies. If one shoots up too much, you buy the other one which presents better value. There is no other coin that can really compete with bitcoin as a store of value and that challenges the concept of fiat money. 
The institutions are only really looking at bitcoin and the average person only knows bitcoin. They will throw billions at it next year just to hedge themselves. It will be worth trillions.
Edit: Hope this isn't BCH shill bait, but they have to admit that bitcoin is where the investment is going.

Not everyone was a SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE before they even heard of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:29:47
Yes, it was a coordinated dump and it went through the stop-losses. I doubt it was a single big player, but bitcoin does have a few rich early investors. Most big players actually take a loss this way. People always talk about whales moving price, but the volume available to buy back is much smaller than the volume that was sold. Swings like this leave big gaps. 
It looks like the market cap and liquidity has gotten so big, that you need about 5k bitcoin to make a dip. That's $50 million and not an amount that any sane person would want to dump in one go. If you hodled thousands of BTC, I can see that you might want to dump some now. The $10k price was a dream when these guys got in. Once we shake out a few more of these early investors, we'll see $20k.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:36:43
The 20 to 40% swings will end once the market cap is over $1 trillion. You don't see 20 to 40% swings in trillion dollar currencies.

Well if you take that $80 trillion and divide by 21 million bitcoin it is not $18 million, it is $3.9 million. And in that figure you were probably including a lot of non-cash asset classes. Also the chance of bitcoin replacing all money is very low, there will always be multiple currencies.

There are many articles on this and there is no confirmed proof, but I agree that there are coincidences that are too coincidental.
Maybe start here:
Not only did he have the programming ability and understanding of cryptography, he has since passed, which might explain why his bitcoin was never touched. He was also involved in "cypherpunks" who were interested in social and political change.
I read that less than 2 miles from his house there lived a man named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, who lost his house to the banks in 08.
Edit: Also he was the first recipient of a bitcoin transaction, 10 BTC, sent by "Satoshi."

If Bitfinex holds any large amount of Tether and if they need that for liquidity, it could be a problem. They haven't released the audit that they promised, so it is likely there is some shortfall and they would fail if everyone withdrew their funds at once. But the same can be said of most banks etc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:27:55
This is actually quite scary. There are only 2 serious miners on bitcoin now. BCH hash power is nearly double BTC hash power.

With institutional money coming in it is likely to correlate with the stock market boom and bust in the long run, but that process has only just started, so we don't know if Bitcoin is overpriced yet.

I have been watching and trading BCH pretty closely. There are regular 500 or 1000 BCH orders coming in every few hours. They were more regular during the main attack a few days ago. 
Even if you have thousands of BTC, that is still 1 or 2 hundred BTC being spent per trade. They can't keep BCH price propped up forever and when they run out, it is going to crash back below 0.1.

It could result in most exchanges losing user's funds and effect their own liquidity, depending on how much they held in Tether. At least one exchange would be bankrupt. As you said, it's "just" loss of confidence, but confidence is everything in bitcoin because there is no underlying asset. Confidence is what drove the price to rise this far.
