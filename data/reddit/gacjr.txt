It's posts like this that make me happy. I spent $450 and used some old hardware and I'm getting 720kh/s so I feel like I did well.

Payment went through today.

I think you know the answer to that question.

I never heard of MinePeon. Thanks @_date: 2013-09-21 23:14:48
Here's what PayPal sent me:
*BF Labs Inc. just sent you a full refund of $xxx.xx USD for your purchase.
It may take 3-5 business days to receive the refund in your PayPal account.* 
So I'll know by the 25th. If there is a problem I will post it here but I do not anticipate any.

Keep 'em, after the shit BFL pulled they deserve to get screwed out of 2 Jalapenos'. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 03:21:41


Well, I'll know in 5 working days. It shows on my PayPal account as *Pending* so I am fairly confident it will be completed. I think BFL just didn't want the hassle of me going through PayPal and submitted the refund to avoid having to deal with them.

Compiling cgminer for the Raspberry Pi and Butterfly Labs “Jalapeño”. 
Help needed for testing script - Easy Litecoin/Bitcoin mining on/using a RPi 
I plan on doing it whenever I get my BFL Jalapeno. I can SSH and VNC into my RasPi from my Linux machine and my Android phone. Right now I am using it as an FTP server. 
Check out the RasPi tutorials here

I was going to sell my Jalapeno on eBay, people aren't buying them like they used to. A month ago you could get 5 to 600 dollars for a Jalapeno, now they on on eBay and people aren't even bidding on them. a 5gh/s Jalapeno won't even mine 1 BTC a month. I hate BFL. !@ them.

Could be legit but then again..... Jsut out of curiosity I added this to my Watch List to see where it goes. Kind of sketchy don't you think?

Yes, but, those links have a more complicated process. All I did was email them saying if they don't ship in 7 days I was going to contact PayPal. I had those links and was prepared to go throgh the process outlined in them fully expecting to get no response from BFL and to my surprise I received an email from them stating the refund was submitted and a notice from PayPal regarding the same. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 05:46:40
That's true. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get mine. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 14:43:29
Well that sucks, I was going to try and get a refund because I paid through PayPal but I guess it's too late. I ordered in March and they actually told me I could expect shipment in June or July. The only way you can get your money back is to sell it as a pre-order on eBay and I'm not even sure if eBay and PayPal are allowing that at this point. Thanks for the great customer service BFL, I hope your reputation destroys your customer base and all future potential sales. But they don't care, they are laughing all the way to the bank.

FYI: No such word as "unsafer", should be "even less safe". :-)

That's it in a nutshell. I ordered mine 5 months ago and still haven't received it. I expecting delivery in about 4 weeks and hoping it will pay for itself in 3-4 months if I'm lucky.The only people making money are BFL.

Great, so, I buy a BFL Jalapeno, wait 6 months for it, it's paid for through PayPal with my money and now PayPal is shutting down or will possibly remove BFL's account. Well, there's not a damn thing they can do about the fact that I already paid for it, that's a done deal right. All they can do is close BFL's PayPal account so BFL requires cash or credit cards for future sales. As far as I am concerned I am probably either never going to get my ASIC or by the time I do the difficulty level will be so high it will be a waste of time to mine. The days of mining Bitcoin are over and have been for over a year, I caught the end of the window of opportunity and I lose just like so many others and the winner is ( drum roll please) BFL. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:10:35
I just emailed BFL and said, ship in 7 days or I'll go to PayPal. Money was returned 6 days later.

A BFL 5GH/S miner will do about ฿0.88 or $125.74 a month @ the current difficulty level of 86933017. If you order now, by the time you get it it will probably take at least 6 months to pay for itself.
