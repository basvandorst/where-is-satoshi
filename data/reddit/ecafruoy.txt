Cool! Good use of shapeways. I'd have a hard time trying for that resolution with a FFF machine running Bronze/copper/steel&amp;PLA filament.... then the sanding and tumbling.

Wow, thanks for the tip. I have them available through makexyz.com on a limited basis (I have limited filament and tags atm).
 I believe you can pay via BTC on that site as well. If anyone is really interested, PM me and I'll send you the link.

I have a mycelium wallet and I hear there is more NFC tag functions coming soon?

Yeah, the material is a PLA plastic mixed with bronze dust by ColorFabb  and I placed a NFC sticker inside the print while the machine was paused. Then the layers on top encased the sticker. Makes for a very finished look and feel. Here is an old vid of a ABS plastic NFC Bitcoin 
I had to sand this bronze one to get it to shine a little and I'm currently waiting for it to come out of a vibrating brass cleaner.

I was curious about this as well, but it seems to be a non-factor. I will eventually try this with  and  .... and I want to say a steel blend.

This is great. You know you can place the NFC tag inside the printed Bitcoin mid print? 
When I started the project all I could find as a use was displaying the wallet address.

Posted a link to a 3DHubs.com thread about this.
