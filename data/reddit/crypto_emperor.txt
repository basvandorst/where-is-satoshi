I personally would have my node handle BTC payments, but my site is powered by Shopify and I haven't figured out yet how to setup custom payments. On the plus side, I do like how coinbase does Ether &amp; litecoin payments as well.

This is a guide to start running your own BTC &amp; LN nodes (Yes, both nodes are required). It is fairly dated and a few lines for the config file are missing for the LN node part, but it's a start in the right direction.
I'll provide you with more help later when you get to that point if you'd like.

I've learned a lot but not all in my experience with bitcoin since March 2016. I do run a full BTC node but haven't had the time to figure out how to connect my node to my shopify store. I'm also wanting to except other cryptos (ethereum &amp; litecoin) but don't have the capacity available to do so, at least at the moment.

Bitmain has their miners setup from default to mine under their pool. Doing a factory-reset only brings it back to mining on antpool. Not sure if it was on purpose, but definitely a clever scheme they have going.

Thanks for the heads up on this. I've probably lost a bunch of potential customers to bitpay (now removed from my site)
What are your thoughts on Coinbase Commerce?

Yes its not bitcoin related but look back at the 2008 recession when the markets were collapsing and a lot of people were panic selling. Markets all around have been shaken up majority of the year. One thing I've been told is that the markets have never gone to zero, as long as there's demand in some form there's value.
Also remember the rules of crypto:
1. Stop panicking! Hodl.
2. Carry a towel. It'll keep you calm in a bear market.
