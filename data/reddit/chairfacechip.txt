You have wait until the Q3 beta release of their command line wallet. They've stated a few times that Shapeshift will likely be the first place you can exchange.

It just took silicon instead of lead.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:56:55
I get your point. The one I was trying to elucidate is that Bitcoin allows for  a "valuable" machine instruction to be transmitted as easily as people tweet one another.

He really is Tony Stark without the drinking problem.

Next big wave of adoption.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:48:15
Fucking dirtbag.
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:24:03
I believe the senator Cato probably understood as much. Dan Carlin's podcast series Death Throes of the Republic is incredible if you're at all interested in following up on your question.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:41:48
Ah, thanks. Nice to know there's someone else on this sub who got the joke.
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:00:50
I don't know. Has Morrisey been singing about it?

@_date: 2017-03-09 12:12:49
"Vermin". Ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:00:47
That sounds perfectly reasonable.
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:42:09
McAfee has a certain reputation at this point -  eccentric probably being the most polite way to put it. Did you feel like you needed to have any of those concerns assuaged, or was it not a huge deal because you're working in just an advisory capacity? Or, do you feel that perception of him is largely unearned? Love me some Shapeshift, by the way.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:57:39
Thanks for your help. All appears to be fine. I commented elsewhere in this post with more detail.
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:00:09
This seems to be some variation of the issue. The Ledger app, until I updated it, seemed to be showing only the change address as the total transferred - referring to the balance as fees. After the update, it looks right. Also, the fees look correct on the block explorer. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:45:55
Other than appreciating one aesthetic over another, I don't really have any criteria for evaluating a blockchain explorer. To that end, what are some of the things you use an explorer to accomplish? I'm interested in becoming more discerning.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:18:09
Code your criticism. Good point.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:24:00
We need you to be serious, btcfun.
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:32:27
Watch me read. Poorly.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:56:35
That's very good of you. Unless the miner already made an adjustment based on your message, the issue appears to have been with the information being displayed by the Ledger app. The pending receipt is showing the expected amount, and after updating the Ledger app, the amounts now show correctly there, too. I think it's going to be okay. Thank you very much for your help. I tried to delete the post before anyone got too involved - but, you beat me to it! Have a good one.
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:42:18
Don't waste your time reading this. My service to you.
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:08:49
Whenever Coinbase is brought up, their straight custodial services are usually the only aspect mentioned. However, the "Advanced User" multisig version of their Vault actually appears to be a legit, hold-your-own-keys implementation. Am I missing anything on that point?
@_date: 2015-04-05 22:43:11
Ditto for me. Good podcast.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:40:13
I started learning programming after finally "getting" what bitcoin was about, and seems almost certain to become. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:08:08
Thanks. Only 15 box-tops and 47 weeks, and they're all mine.

News reporter here. Can I get a quote from you on these self-aware penguins?
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:40:01
Yeah. Seems kind of a no-brainer in terms of features for this type of application.
@_date: 2015-03-05 23:57:52
Pretty cool. Got a kind of Angelo Badalamenti vibe. Always a good thing. I've been thinking about the best way to go about collecting Bitcoin donations for my [band]( What method are you using to collect? Was really hoping for some sort of Soundcloud integration.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:18:22
Welcome back.
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:46:51
What don't you like about Bitcoin Wallet for Android? I appreciate the user interface, but don't know what the specific drawbacks might be.
@_date: 2015-03-08 02:35:20
If I can help just one person perform a single esoteric task, I know it's all been worth it.
@_date: 2015-11-06 23:19:05
Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:39:45
Hope you weren't on an internet-connected printer when you did those.
@_date: 2015-03-06 00:09:13
You guys sound real nice - and you've got a horse on your album cover. You can't beat that. Here's 100 bits. @_date: 2015-03-07 19:08:46
Had some audio issues at first. Looks good for me know, though.
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:44:53
Yeah. I finally turned it off.
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:04:06
Cool. Here's an attaboy. @_date: 2015-03-07 19:16:11
Didn't expect this presentation to get into "tamper-proof assholes". Never considered that particular vector for attack.
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:32:05
I was curious about this, too. You can do so by:
1. Save image to phone
2. Crop down to where the QR code is taking up most of the image
3. After you save it, use the Share button in the Gallery, and select Google Goggles
4. After it auto-scans, you can copy the key, and paste into your wallet
Might work with other scanning apps/OS. I only tried Goggles/Android.
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:41:53
Been signed up for a while. Works as advertised. For the most part, I forget I'm even using it.
@_date: 2015-03-08 02:46:47
Done. Good luck.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:13:58
Thanks, man.
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:12:45
Thanks for the response. I'll have to test out restoring a backup with meta data.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:04:38
I hear this Bitcoin thing is going to be big.
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:30:32
Useful suggestion. 500 bits to you. @_date: 2015-03-10 15:39:49
Exact same scenario for me.
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:00:52
Big Book shill!

Give Satoshi a place to dump all his Bitcoin, should he decide to take an altruistic route. I'm sure there are all sorts of technical problems here, but the idea is a World Wallet. A single point of donation that automatically redistributes whatever comes in across 7 billion individual wallets - one of which would be claimable by every person on the planet, as they learn of it/acquire the technology to do so.

I don't know myself, but if you check out the Orlando Bitcoin Meetup.Com,the guy who runs it might be able to get you in touch with one of the members - a dude who operates two machines in town. If I run into him anytime soon, I'll get back to you.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:35:04
Yeah, you'll need to be patient. It took about 72 business hours for the initial response. I wasn't in a rush, so it was okay. Can imagine it being frustrating if you need to move or buy, though.

My phone bricked without warning, lost access to Coinbase as a result. Had no way to directly recover my Authenticator account. Was able to establish my identity with Coinbase customer service (an involved process - but, one to which they were reasonably attentive). They then disabled 2FA on my account, but with a 48 hour delay, during which time they sent two emails each day indicating that this request had been made. After 48 hours I was able to log in without 2FA, then reestablish.

Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that he isn't simply trying to pump Ethereum. Or, even better, let's agree that he is, and this is his argument for why you should sell Bitcoin, and buy ETH. What would be your assessment of his argument? What reasons would you site in order to convince some fence-sitting investor to remain in Bitcoin?
