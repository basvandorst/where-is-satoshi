Yes, this is called "playing with house money" or "playing with your profits".
Good way to keep what you've invested back into your pockets, while playing with money that you would not have had anyways , so even if you lost it all no big deal.

Prices will fluctuate like crazy. Have to wait till tomorrow when the real volatility will kick in because the real traders and people who are actively trading will start their jobs tomorrow Monday morning.

You have a job? Bro...you're doing cryptocurrency wrong

The only problem is, that people won't be using Bitcoin as a means of purchasing things, given that it will rise in a demand so much that one day you're paying one bitcoin for something, and then the next day that same item would be worth half a bitcoin because the value of bitcoin rose so much.
I know that because I was about to purchase something for $70 (0.00855400 of a bitcoin before), and going to send bitcoin over, but then I realized wtf am I doing....and used my credit card. Few days later bitcoin is skyrocketing and that 0.00855400 of bitcoin is worth now $135.

For your 3rd point,
I highly disagree with what you said. Understanding those patterns and different moving averages and indicators helped me make a lot of my money. 
You may not be as good at reading the patterns/indicators, but I for one through experience can vouch that I have made some amazing plays when I see a squeeze coming up when the bollinger bands are tight and the volatility has come to a stand still. Then within the next few minutes or maybe an hour when volatility picks up, it is sky rocketing. You also see how much a coin/stock is overbought/oversold, and when it will go in an upward trend or a downward trend.
Not only that, but you factor in other things such as when the other side of the world is awake and trading, or when there is news/rumours, these other factors play a huge part in knowing when to use the indicators or not.
And finally....What do you think the bot programs use when they are programmed to play the market? You think they are just programmed knowing how to buy stuff on the whim? They use the indicators to the tee. Mathematically calculating all the variables so that they know exactly how to sell for the profit and know when to buy in, and how to scale in to average down.

Lol....sometimes, you need to learn to cut your losses. Someone who buys something at $20 and holds till it drops to $5 is bad at the game and shouldn't invest.
You should know to cut your losses at $15, hell even $17 if you have a certain target price or percentage yuo are trying to hit. 
IF you're just a HODL, but buy at the worst time possible and it drops all the way down due to FUD or other shit...then you're shit out of luck hoping it comes back. Just liek NEO, whe npeople were buying that coin at $50 and it tanked. You telling those guys to hold ? that coin shit the bed to $10 and only in the last few weeks bounced back.

Alright, yeah if you are speaking in terms of just HODLing BTC...then yeah HODLing till the end of time is good. But, even like today, when it was correcting itself...good way to get out is to pair it with USDT (even though I feel USDT is scammy and sketchy af, it does the job of preserving your wealth).
And yes, BTC will only grow when more people invest into it. It spiked to 10-11k price points because of THanksgiving and people got around the table to talking. Older generations got hooked by the younger generation's knowledge and they are swept up in the frenzy now.
