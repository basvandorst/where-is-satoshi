Jim, are you in fact Bill Cowher? I've never seen the two of you together and I have to say that until proven otherwise, you're the same person.

Jim Harper said it best. "Can you become a financial services law expert in under 45 days? If not, you might want to sign this"

The term "Big Bitcoin Business" is hilarious in it's absurdity.
Startups in this ecosystem that didn't exist 3 years ago being compared to Big Tobacco, Big Sugar, or Big [Anything] is absolutely comical. 
The enemies of decentralization or whatever "force" you're against OP aren't Coinbase, Mastercoin, or the BTC Foundation Core Devs. The enemies of decentralization are Visa, Bank of America, Western Union and other incumbents bitcoin will run circles around as the technology evolves.

I wouldn't worry about this fellow. Bitcoin/Digital Currencies have newly organizing education &amp; Advocacy groups like [Chamber for Digital Commerce]( [CoinCenter]( and [StartBitcoin]( that are communicating the utility, benefits, and value of bitcoin and the blockchain. This is one "reporter" from a publication of questionable relevance. 
If you do feel compelled, contact your representative directly and tell them how bitcoin is positively impacting you and why they should want to educate themselves about it. Don't email the general inbox; instead call and ask who on the legislative staff deals with technology/finance issues and send that staffer an email directly.
