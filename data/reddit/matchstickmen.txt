One single dollar as in $1? I do not believe this is correct.

Preferably we are offering a convertible debt scheme, eventually offering equity after we get a chance to do a real valuation. You will get a percentage of the profit once equity stake is established.
The California Board of Money Transaction requires all applicants hold a networth of $500k and present their business plan in front of the board for approval. They have yet to issue a Bitcoin ATM entity a license. Been in contact and heard very positive feedback from the CABoMT. 
We raised enough capital to own and operate an ATM. No where in our research or consulting or advising did the $500k networth get brought up. It through a wrench in the gears.
I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Economics and Accounting. I am now working for a well respected commercial real estate brokerage house in San Diego. 
Edit: Please ignore my typos and spelling.

We will gladly look over all opportunities. 
Taxes will need to be paid on fees as they are concrete, the rest of gains will be paid on a good faith basis.
We run two LLCs. The first is the operational company that hold licenses/ATM. The second owns the first LLC, and is registered as an investment equity group that way our investments and holdings are distanced if the government ever decides to shut down the operational company. The best protection we can provide. 
I assure you we are not scammers, this is must easier to prove not on Reddit.
PM if interested :)
