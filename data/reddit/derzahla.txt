Christ thats alot for a roof.  Take care man.  Didnt mean any hostility.  Hope you can get the roof resolved.

sounds like someones wife doesnt have a shit of respect for him
@_date: 2014-05-17 09:16:18
eh whatever mate. sorry if i offended you. I just think a husband and wife should have mutual respect for each other and you saying that yours would "fucking kill you" for making a financial decision that you, at least, implied you might want to make doesnt sit well with me.  Wish you the best of luck.

Sorry, I checked and didnt see anything yet.  The email was sent about an hour before I posted it here

Yeh, trying to find out myself but I cant remember my btcchina pw and yeh, the site still says to use a bank transfer.  I know taobao has the vouchers, but not sure where else.  If one of their resellers accepts China Union Pay this could be huge.

huh?  is that tom selleck? 
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:59:37
well if you agree then fix your roof, dont buy bitcoin, and stop whining.  When I think something is a good investment(not saying bitcoin is) my wife would damn well stand behind me.  Granted, I have a proven track record of making good financial decisions.  I guess if you have lost your mutual money before, then kudos to your wife for not trusting you with it

Im going to kill myself if anymore of these dumbass posts happen
@_date: 2014-01-08 11:33:04
taobao doesnt accept visa.  its a bitch buying things on taobao, you pretty much need a chinese bank account or you need to buy a "recharge card" somewhere locally
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:00:13
um, youre forgetting the 10% theyre also going to bill you.
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:41:28
what does "banned bitcoin" mean?  You can still buy BTCC vouchers. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:39:59
yeh, why woukdnt you do the transaction at a bank or sonewhere with cameras?

Uhh.  Sounds like she lived a pretty standard if not fortuNate life for one in her position. Nothing super tragic
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:03:54


ahaha.  Seems you are completely pulling this out of your ass. What gives you the knowledge to make matter of fact statements like that about China? Ive never seen so many people pushing the boundries of law as in China.  No rule or law is hard and fast there.  Every law can be bended or broken if you grease the right palm.  And as long as you dont cause someone important to loose face you you probably wont even get noticed. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:42
You are.  Youre still stupid.
@_date: 2013-07-10 11:50:02
for 4000RMB or about 640USD for 10GH/s, about how long that take to break even assuming 1BTC stays at 75USD... Sorry, it's been awhile since I've read about mining and im too lazy to look it up.  but i do live/work in China and have a taobao account so this is interesting to me.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:55:02
sorry, but i dont take your word for it. Again, please tell me "What gives you the knowledge to make matter of fact statements like that about China?"?

I funded my account by wire and it arrived JUST after you suspended trading. Will I get my wire fee reimbursed? Thanks.

Im pretty tech savvy but i am fairly new to bitcoin.  what is the  best practice for securing my shit?  lets say a not-insignificant amount  that i have in a online wallet right now but want to put in cold storage.  I typically use osx and linux at home. btw, i currently have TFA enabled but i guess i should still be worried.
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:32:24
A bit over $5000 for me.
@_date: 2013-07-10 12:26:12
Ahh thanks.  After translating though to english looks like 4000RMB is only a downpayment and they dont know how much it will end up costing
