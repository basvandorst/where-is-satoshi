But, to know how much capital gains tax to pay, you have to know how much you gained, vs your initial investment. So you have to know your initial investment, and likely therefore your transaction history.

How does running a full node relate to mining? Please enlighten; thanks in advance.

I don't know how much this will help you, but I know there are 3 different accounting methods to choose from when deciding how much capital gains tax you should pay on your sales. There's FIFO, or first-in-first-out, wherein your first sale corresponds to your first purchase, and your tax is on the gain between those two prices. Then there's LIFO, or last-in-first-out, wherein your sale corresponds to your most recent purchase, calculating gains between those two prices. Finally there's the average cost method, wherein the gain for a sale is calculated based on the weighted average purchase price of all of your holdings at the time of the sale. FIFO seems more appropriate for a long term holder, since presumably you'd be able to use the long term capital gains tax rate, which is lower than the short term one. However LIFO may be helpful if your recent purchases were relatively highly priced, since then your gain would be relatively small. I'm not exactly sure what the advantages of the average cost method are, but you can research it; Google "average cost basis method capital gains". Keep in mind that once you pick a method you have to stick with it. But if you have never sold any coin before (read: you've never claimed capital gains in your tax return before) then you haven't yet committed yourself to a method. So choose wisely!

Thank you. Doesn't he still have too get dirty with the numbers though, to get his average?

No, it's not a tax on income, it's a tax on gains. If you take out $100 of bitcoin that you originally paid $25 for, you pay tax on $75, not $100.

Inflation won't eat it? Really? I mean I know that you won't experience the kinds of inflation caused by central bank manipulation, like quantitative easing and whatnot, but there are also more "natural" mechanisms of inflation, right? How is bitcoin immune to those? It is it only because the price keeps rising at a pace faster than inflation? Do you expect it to keep rising FOREVER?

That's my guess too. But, it's not a good point, because as others have said, a chain fork is not the same thing as a code fork, and, code forks are a normal part of the contribution process.

For crypto you pay tax on gains, not income.

If this thing would also allow investment in bitcoin options, to hedge my bets, I'd be all over it...
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:55:20
Your options are FIFO, LIFO, or average cost. I've been told LIFO isn't really a legitimate option for crypto...

The decree that makes fiat fiat is not about the quantity in circulation, but rather that the USD shall be accepted as legal tender for all debts public and private (or whatever that exact verbiage is).

What about the average cost method?  That's the third option, right?  How relevant do you think that is to crypto?
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:44:04
Really? I watched that recently and heard no such conclusion.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:23:41
appreciate the input.  can you explain a bit why LIFO is not appropriate for a rapidly appreciating asset?  or point us to somewhere we can read about it?
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:21:05
my own answer is here already, but only implicitly, and spread across multiple comments, so here it is in one place: withdrawing BTC is not a taxable event.  when you trade away your BTC in exchange for USD, that is the taxable event.  if you just hodl, you will owe no income tax.  if just move BTC from coinbase to your wallet elsewhere, you will owe no income tax.
Whether the IRS can subsequently track those BTC you moved away, and somehow trace them forward to an exchange for USD that happened elsewhere, that's a question that's beyond my understanding of the blockchain...

Ooh, cool, hadn't heard of that one, thanks for chiming in. Is it appropriate for crypto though? That sounds like it's only appropriate for securities with identifiers like serial numbers or something.

A majority of Muslims are executing terrorism? A majority of Jews were executing debt slavery? Sorry, but that's racist. Okay, maybe not technically racist, if you're demonizing a religion and not an ethnicity, but just as bad.

I didn't have to install anything to use my spreadsheet: it's in Google Sheets.

Some decent monetary theory here, which is rare. See also the American Monetary Institute's American Monetary Act, a re-hashing of the 1920's "Chicago Plan", which was introduced to multiple sessions of Congress by Dennis Kucinich under the name "the NEED Act". It essentially calls for the government to de-privatize the Federal Reserve and issue all future money as debt free, which sounds like exactly what Hitler did(according to your article here anyways). This would eliminate the national debt and give us the funds to pay for all the infrastructure improvements that everyone agrees we need, as well as whatever other public works or good would serve us. I highly recommend researching that bill/plan.
I think it's sad though that people still feel the need to focus on the "Jewry". Even if it were true that the entire international banking system is controlled by Jews, that wouldn't mean that ALL Jews are complicit. What racist logic.

This. If it doesn't update dynamically, it's no better than my spreadsheet :P
