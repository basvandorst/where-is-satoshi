Hello from Serbia (ex Yugoslavia), home of one of the world's biggest hyperinflations in 1993: 
 STOP SPREADING THIS CRAP.
Hyperinflation is a symptom of a far, far greater problem which plagues a country or region.
Non tl;dr:
The government was unable to pay its debts, it was unable to pay out stable pensions as it has spent all of its currency on wars and lining other people's pockets. They started printing money, and thus the Yugoslav Dinar inflation skyrocketed, to the point where you couldn't wait one single day to spend your dinars, otherwise they would be worthless the next day. This means nobody accepted dinars, even though everybody was legally obligated to.
What did the people use? The German Mark (primarily), the US Dollar and the Hungarian Forint. No one was able to stop them. The black market was thriving.
Here, have a 5 minute subtitled video: 
However, if this hyperinflation would happen today, nobody in their right mind would use Bitcoin. Why?
- Unstable electric grid: yes, the situation would be a bit better due to personal solar power, but blackouts and brownouts were daily occurrences, and sometimes we went weeks without power
- Unstable/no internet: internet would be unavailable, or severely restricted. If you could smuggle in a two way satellite connection or try to get yourself shot in the face by trying to install a mast near the border to do a p2p wireless connection, then you had a chance. Otherwise? No.
- The requirement to own an electronic device. Paper works without a battery.
- Stability: **what most people wanted was a stable currency**. If 10$ buys you 10lbs of flour, and the next day it buys you 9.97lbs or 10.3lbs, that's fine. But if 10$ gets you 30lbs of flour or 0.3lbs of flour the next day, then what's the point?
In situations like these, you primarily need shelter, a readiness kit, some stored food, basic medicine, an alternative power source (solar panels, etc.), a plan and foreign currency of different kinds. But what you need the most is knowledge. Invest in yourself. If shit hits the fan, your money can be gone in an instant (this includes Bitcoin). Your house? Rubble. But nobody can take away what you've learned.
Invest in Bitcoin if you want, but don't think of BTC as the solution to a disgusting mess like the one in Venezuela.

I also remember people saying "buy buy buy" when bitcoin "crashed" to 800$.

They CAN ban Bitcoin if they set their minds to it. Countries which have their own currencies do not allow competing currencies to step in, even just a little. If Bitcoin steps on the USD, EUR or RUR's toes just an inch, they will react aggressively, no matter how many libertarian ideas you have thought up for Bitcoin's future.
Possible solution from the top of my head: If you had Bitcoins in a "Bitcoin bank" outside the US in a country that has no issues with BTC, and then use a credit/debit card from that bank to pay for goods in the US, then your bank would essentially convert BTC to USD and do the payment in USD, which could turn out OK. But then, regulations would have to be introduced... oh boy...

He won't take a single bitcoin.
He'll take USD, though, gladly. All transactions are processed via BitPay, and he won't see a single BTC. He'll just get his cash. He doesn't trust Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean he can't use a 3rd party to take the risk for him.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:34:43
Bitcoin is anything but anonymous... so there's that...
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:54:13
Yeah... better trade with the most popular and active exchange, with plenty of media coverage (even on TV), with an actual physical address and a CEO that's part of the Bitcoin Foundation to boot.

The price rises to the moon and Wells Fargo cashes out, earning tons of money.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:52:33
It's not money.
BTC is property, according to the US government.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:43:26
If a ban does come, it won't come in the form of a p2p filter methinks - probably just a "heads up" to the banks to halt and seize any BTC related transactions, and a ban on US businesses from accepting BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:08:39
Let me tell you something... if the dollar crashes that hard, the infrastructure for the internet will be highly compromised, and because of that, Bitcoin simply won't be tradeable.
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:18:30


Yeah, about that...
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:28:12
I'm indifferent to Dogecoin in general ("whatever floats your boat"), but I really don't understand why do people have to be assholes with their tipping culture.
If someone says something critical towards doge, or even if they're talking about something completely irrelevant, people like you show up to tip them a fraction of a cent... why the need to be an obnoxious asshole like that?
@_date: 2014-05-26 08:01:33
Jesus jumping Christ, are you effin' sane? Who's idea was this?
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would accept Bitcoin for their hard work (providing your story is true, op) and DOESN'T know about it's fluctuations?
What if he received 700$ after he got paid in BTC? What would he say then?
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:41:58
Russians will keep their savings in the USD or EUR, most likely in their mattresses.
I know this because I've seen hyperinflation happen... it's much easier to choose a stabler hard currency than something as volatile as bitcoin, especially in areas where internet connectivity is not that great.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:08:06
It's kinda the truth, though... One mention of cryptocurrency in various subreddits, and plenty of shibes will start to spam "to the moon" and donate 0.02$ in dogecoin to various people.
If, by any chance there is negative discussion towards dogecoin, the usual response is similar to "wow so mad".
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:22:37
Y'all now realize there's a man sitting behind there with a "Fuck" T-shirt.

FYI: Even with 40% of all hashrates, they have the power to attack the system, it's just harder.

I frequently get paid in my local currency and in Euros (illegally). There is very little difference in what I get paid in. If there is not enough demand for my services, if the economy is "bad" in general, if my business isn't going well, I could get paid in euros, or a suitable equivalent in gold buillon, BTC or glitter-decorated seashells, and it would still be the same.
Unless there is a specific disruption in monetary flow due to various draconian government measures or currency mismanagement, BTC, especially at this state, won't be helping.
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:57:46
This is my main point usually... very few keep their coins as-is, most convert to USD as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:20:47


Waiiit a second... That would mean Google would have to become a BTC exchange. BTC has been steady for a while, but it's still very volatile. Would Google want to go into the deep waters like that?
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:38:49
I'm not taking it personally.
But for Reddit's sake, and for your sake, stop it. The Dogetipbot and other coin bots have been banned by the mods from various subreddits because you guys start tipping circlejerks way too often and spam-up the thread.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:43:26


Which will dissipate and fluctuate if the price remains this low.


Crappy world economy = crappy bitcoin economy. It's not just about currencies, it's about goods and services, bringing food on the table. You still pay your taxes in your local currency and chances are it's more stable than BTC could ever be. A bad economy isn't bad just because of a certain fiat currency you dislike, BTC isn't panacea.


If I were to purchase something with Bitcoin right now, my options are really, really limited and I would have to go through all sorts of loops to acquire some BTC. After I do so, I would have to take on the risk of losing some of my money because Bitcoin is so volatile, so I need to buy more BTC to make a purchase "just in case". Even a tech savvy person like me finds that to be too much, let alone the average Joe.
I wish Bitcoin remained what it was supposed to be, and what even Buffett admits it is good for - transfer of funds. But instead everyone turned it either into a libertarian wet dream, or into a stock... a get rich quick scheme, pumps and dumps, "China's sleeping" and "India will switch to BTC soon"... coupled with tons of useless altcoins exploding all over the place, burning away energy into driving overheated 7950s, 280xs and 290xs which were once utilized for SHA256 mining until ASICs came along. Each and every one of those coins is living a life of despair in the bottom of BTC's outhouse, all hoping one of them will "to the moon" just like BTC once did. And, ironically, those alts are helping BTC's popularity and activity, but they die off quickly and quietly.
So, I ask you, what *is* keeping Bitcoin alive?
Is it the shady BTC exchanges? Is it the people who tell you you're dumb for having some money at Mt.Gox after it crashed? Is it the consistently awful news system which contains mostly dumb speculation and rumors? Is it people like you who sound exactly like the Winklevoss twins trying to sell something? Is it the zealots who sound like doomsday preppers or MLM scammers in their BTC advocacy? Is it the BTC Foundation's bad rep? Is it the lack of creativity and immersion in improving BTC? Is it BTC's wealth inequality? Is it the governments fearing it?
You spend your dollars, euros, pounds sterling, rubles, renminbi yuans, rands and dinars daily. You make them circulate, you make them have value. You put your trust in them. When you get paid, you do not put everything aside for safe keeping, you spend it. But how many times have people purchased goods with BTC? Do they purchase anything at all? Or do they just play a noob's game of forex on exchanges? Or do they just "hodl" like you are now?
If you don't spend your currency, what good is it?
Hold, buy, sell, whatever... but face the music - very few of you are using Bitcoin as a currency, and thus few are willing to step into it's waters. All you're doing is selling big promises and are boasting with other people's emerging technologies which, at this rate, will never come. Now BTC is stuck in a chicken-egg situation... People refuse to use it because it's so shady and volatile and in order for it to become less shady and volatile, people need to use it. Something new needs to come up on the horizon to break the chain, but I'm not seeing it.
Y'all rode the speculation rollercoaster to the top... welcome to the bottom. Now either innovate and use Bitcoin or continue riding the rollercoaster which drops and rises based on semi-literate rumor threads on bitcointalk. Just be careful - there probably won't be another "OMG CHINA" scenario any time soon.
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:50:09
So, you're essentially trying to use them as a BTC-&gt;USD exchange at this point.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:04:13


And she should.
Does she even know what it is? Her financial adviser can't just tell someone to invest in Bitcoin, and when the price goes up and down like a rollercoaster to shrug and say "enjoy the ride"... Bitcoin is more than a risky investment, and every damn person online knows that, he did the right thing by telling her to avoid it.
Also, would you risk your overall reputation in your business circles like that?
