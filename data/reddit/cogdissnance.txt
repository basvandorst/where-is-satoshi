The whole idea that deflation is bad comes from the Keynesian Economic which is a warped and seriously F'd up theory and way to view economic history. Proven by the last 100 years or so of a declining dollar and economic decay.
IMO the Austrian school knows where it's at.

The way I see it, currently the supply is very limited, and the amount of people who invest in bitcoin every day is growing exponentially (according to MtGox their verification cues doubled in Jan, x3 in Feb and x6 in march and is still growing), plus the new businesses accepting bitcoin also grow everyday, all these factors put together are probably leading to the growth we have now.
Is it sustainable forever? No. But think about it, how many people do you know that have invested in bitcoins? For me it's literally 0 (people i know in person). The awareness of bitcon is minimal so the potential for growth is still high. 
Eventually we will pass the actual price and bitcoin will drop and stabilize but I see that price much higher than what it currently is. I wouldnt be surprised if it goes to 2,000 and then drops to 1,000. Maybe it'll get to only 1,000 and drop to 500, who knows?
What I do know is that even after that drop, in the long term, Bitcoin will pull through and as a deflationary currency only can do, will slowly rise in value.

get a decent Sdcard and just download BitcoinWallet (uses like 1-2.5GB at the moment, a new update will lower it) if you have an android. Blockchain based their app on it so it's the same thing and it's fully local. Let's you export the wallet.dat as well as encrypt it incase you lose your phone.

It is still possible to stay fully anonymous using Bitcoin. I mean it's more difficult considering the massive amounts of data the NSA is collecting.
Let's assume that all your internet traffic is being monitored/collected, and you need to make a completely anonymous transfer from cash to bitcoin, and then buy something with bitcoin.
1. Use an old android phone/PC to download a bitcoin wallet while connected to a public wifi source 
    (Use a MAC spoofer if you're really paranoid.) This way your personal ip is never seen.
2. Trade in cash with someone for bitcoin face to face or by sending money to an account through moneygram, greendot etc...
3. Buy items with bitcoin using public wifi as well.
So yeah, its not completely impossible just extremely impractical to be totally anonymous while using bitcoin.
Also although yes all your transaction can be traced they only correspond with a random address not any real personal information, and you can just generate a new address for each transaction.
EDIT: Also would like to point out that this would work even if you had a static IP and were living alone.

I've posted about this over on r/BitcoinDevBounties
Trading between crypto currencies would be(comparatively) pretty easy to do. Having a P2PX that involves trading in fiat is much harder. This is because there's always the possibility of charge-backs. One of the simpler ways would be if banks would send SSL certificates confirming that a deposit has been made (so proving payment has gone through) but again this defeats the purpose of being decentralized.
As for ripple it is similar but its more like a Federation of servers that connect people, not completely decentralized.

Buying an ASIC isnt a bad idea right now (as long as its not from BFL)... My gaming PC (just has a 7850) makes roughly $2.75 a day at  around 240MH/s. Im sure an ASIC rig can do much better. 
Putting a some money into both wouldnt be a bad idea. 
(also GPU rig wont be as powerful but if BTC crashes the parts can still be sold for about the same value )
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:24:21

MtGox is one of, if not the largest bitcoin exchanges. Fact of the matter is that if MtGox wanted to stop the panic selling they could've easily shut off the servers/ blocked trading etc. No one has any authority over total BTC supply. MtGox DOES have the authority to decide whether to let you use their exchange or not.
I wonder what kind of freedom you think the dollar gives you. (hint: NONE)

Don't you set your own fees? Although a transaction with a fee of zero would obviously take forever to get confirmed. And with this thing about fees talking a larger part in the future wouldnt a fee of .0005 by then be worth tens if not hundreds of dollars?

To be fair they just print money and trade derivatives anyway. They dont care if they have gold or not. I agree that they are low on gold now, yet the effect's are barely visible. The problem is that USD is still controlled by them and as long as USD is necessary to live your life they will have that power over you. 
The power BTC has here is that IF it becomes widely accepted it would eliminate the use of USD (except for taxes but that will sort itself out).
Gold is a good asset and I own some myself, but I can buy much more with BTC than I can with gold (which is only useful in a physical trade anyway)

For keeping a Ledger for transactions for example something like (or THE) blockchain could be used, since it can store data in transactions, as well as send messages that can be verified to have come from certain wallets.
It's a great idea but remember that in the end we would still be dependent on the companies creating the payment card. Unfortunately as long as fiat is involved things like chargebacks will always be an issue, but we can atleast hope to minimize.
I started off in Java (though its been years already) but do Python now so I'm kind of rusty. Either way if you need any help just let me know.

Well I cant speak for others but I've heard plenty say that it is or that all they get are constant promises for "by the end of this month". So yes I guess I am speaking for others though lol.

I get what you're trying to say but I think "pegs" is the wrong word.
If it was "pegged" to local currencies that would mean that some central agency selling them at a certain price and therefore is holding the price at at that point.

Did you even listen to what they said? They were basically saying these reasons are VERY unlikely. They show they know how the blockchain works much better than most as well as debunk these common misconceptions easily.
All you just did was reiterate what they were saying. Except you're stating they were dumb questions to begin with.
To most people those are their concerns about Bitcoin and they clearly and accurately stated why those issues wouldn't affect Bitcoin.
Did you even listen to it?

I've looked at it and played around with it as well (working on it right now actually) it's legit. It uses another Opensource project 'GoxTool' as its back-end and GoxGui is mostly the front end. Haven't looked at the back-end that much but what I did see there's nothing fishy.

I would have to disagree. The way credit card companies hand out loans are insanely predatory.
They purposely make the minimums less than just your interest payments. You could pay the minimum for years and still owe more and more each month. They can lower your credit limit arbitrarily and often if you happen to miss a payment and decide that you would rather pay it all off at once they then cut your limit.
Even if you default they still make money by then selling your debt to a collection agency. Besides the only reason that the economy hasn't completely shut down in the last 40 years is because credit card companies have been giving people easier and easier lines of credit to boost their buying power. Just look up how much income has changed and compare that to how much personal debt has in the past decades.
The credit card companies are just helping the banks put you in a world where debt is the only way to live. You cant blame people for being irresponsible when they are provoked to be so.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:59:48
People would sell at a lower price to cash out. If everyone started doing this at the same time though it would cause a chain of lower and lower prices leading to panic selling and then the crash lol.

Its more profitable to miners of they lower energy consumption. That being in their best interests the energy thing shouldn't be much of a problem. Especially when new ASICs are coming out that only consume fractions of the wattage of a GPU rig.

It doesnt matter how fast his machines are. He wouldnt be able to flood the market with Bitcoin as you can only mine 25BTC every 10 Minutes. Putting in more power just means you get a larger percentage of that 25BTC. So if everyone mining got one of those tomorrow they would all be getting the exact same amount of BTC as they were before.
All currencies make nefarious people wealthy. That's why they are nefarious people, they usually screw others over to make their own gain.
Not trusting a new currency is natural, but they've already answered pretty much every question over at the Bitcoin wiki. As far as I can tell, as long as merchants support Bitcoin it will make for a very powerful currency.
@_date: 2013-08-24 20:10:00

As a counter argument to the last part of your post, Bitcoins might not be "backed" by anything but neither is the Dollar or any Fiat currency for that matter. Yes the government does trade in dollars but if no shops were willing to accept it, it would be worthless. Money was invented solely to represent value, and because of the convenience.
The representation part is all public confidence, but Bitcoin beats anything when it comes to convenience.
As for transactions, they aren't forced to have a fee. Unless the bitcoins you own are made up of tiny amounts that come from several different addresses, and I think only Bitcoin-qt enforces this.
And those tiny fractions that are left might not be worth anything now but because of the deflation maybe one day they will. Otherwise they could just be sent without a fee (which will take longer to get processed).
Bitcoin is much more secure than any other currency in existence. Some people always take that to mean that it's un-hackable but actually they mean you cant replicate a Bitcoin.
There are plenty of counterfeit dollars and the banking system actually creates money out of nothing on their ledgers (seriously, Im not joking).
But a Bitcoin is either in the blockchain, or it's not a Bitcoin.

Actually they can be divided infinitely. The current Programs just only calculate up to 8 decimal.

The Bitcoin wiki answers alot of these quesitons.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:26:53
people are currently developing bitcoin escrow systems, but for right now I guess that would be a problem. Giving discounts for purchases made with bitcoins would be great incentive though. At the rate the market is going holding them for a couple days would make up the value (or to be safe just insta-exchange for USD with bitinstant).
In my opinion just the fact that you accept bitcoin would help though. Many here have said they would support bitcoin accepting sites, myself included.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:48:07
It's proportional to the total amout of work. So let's say all ASIC's double the whole networks GH/s everyone would get half as many BTC as they would normally.

It depends on your manufacturer since they are the ones who push the update to phones. Although the apps themselves could just use a different random number generator, which if I'm not mistaken the bitcoin wallet app did just that in a recent update.

No it's deflationary. As an example all the gold in the world hasnt been found, but every time we dig up less and less and it gets harder and harder to find. THAT is deflationary. The only way the supply could make it inflationary is everyone only bought 1BTC every 10000000000 years. And the 25BTC/10Minute rate was considered "too much"
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:16:18
The rate of growth needs to slow, or there WILL be a correction. 
In the long term though the price will continue to grow short term (1-3 years depend on how fast/slow its adopted) there might be a correction if the price growth surpasses the adoption rate by too much.
