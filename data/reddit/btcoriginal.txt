Sorry you don't like the store. The shirts are actually very reasonably priced and if you were  to buy the same quality from a store in your local mall they would be noticeably more expensive. 
In response to your complaint about my number of posts this is the first negative response I have received.  I think most people are actually interested in hearing about it. If more people complain then I'll definitely cut back, but four posts a day on my opening weekend doesn't seem like a lot to me.

That's  a part of the store platform I'm using. Unfortunately at this point in time, as far as I'm aware, you have to use a traditional online store platform that was designed to accept credit cards and add an app to it to accept bitcoin at checkout.
My store opened this week so I appreciate the question and I'm always looking for ways to make shopping on it a better bitcoin experience.
It's also used to collect a shopping address.

On the shirts currently available I use discharge printing. Like water based ink you won't feel the print on the shirt and it won't wash away overtime. 
As I increase my line of products I will use plastisol and water based ink depending on the material and color.
Thanks for the question.

The shirts are priced at $26 because they are a premium product. 
I have bought shirts before that after  being washed a few times they have lost their shape and stitching has come undone. That is not the case with the shirts I'm offering. 
These are quality shirts. The shirts I currently have available are a tri-blend Poly/Cotton/Rayon. 50% Polyester, 25% Cotton, 25% Rayon mix. 
They are very soft and extremely comfortable. They are also stitched to a very high standard. They won't shrink or lose their shape and they will continue to get softer with every wash. It's also important to me that the products I offer are created in a responsible manner. All I've my shirts are WRAP certified (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production). 
These are high quality designer shirts, that's why they're $26.
Thanks for checking out the website and posting your question.

Okay, thanks for letting me know.
I tried to sign up for advertising but there aren't any spaces available for months. 
Am I able to announce new products or promos when I have them?

Fedoras is a great idea. We don't have any plans lined up to add them at the moment, but definitely a possibility in the future.

I'm using bitpay as my payment gateway and unfortunately at this time they don't give that option. Once you checkout the price will adjust to bitcoin.
Thanks for asking.

I use a premium quality tri-blend shirt.
They are extremely soft making them very comfortable. They can be compared to American apparel shirts or any other fashion focused tshirt.
You can find more info go to my website and select "about us".

Thanks for shopping with us!
I don't understand the downvotes either. I am truly a supporter of bitcoin and I want to see it succeed as a mainstream form of payment.
The reason I created btc Original was to create a place with unique products that can only be purchased bitocin. I thought more of the bitcoin community would like this.
Thanks again.

Thanks for the question. We are just getting off the ground and more product will be coming soon. Right now I'm testing the waters to see how interested customers are in a bitcoin exclusive apparel store. If there is a good response then there will be a lot more product available soon.

Yeah, unfortunately if I were to charge $15 the quality of the shirts would go way down. Quality is definitely a priority for me. I want my customers to be happy with their shirts long after they purchased them.
I appreciate your feed back. 
I'll be adding more product soon so check back and maybe you'll find something to your liking.
Thanks again,

Thanks for the input. 
I changed the site so an account is no longer required. We still will need an email and address for shipping and notifications.

If you don't mind my asking do you wear graphic t-shirts and if so how much do you generally spend?
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:55:22
I appreciate the feedback. I guess the ideal would be to display the prices in both USD and bitcoin.
