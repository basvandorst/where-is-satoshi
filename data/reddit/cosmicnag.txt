Good question... surprised its not asked more... the way I look at it is this : A successful LN will massively increase the utility and hence value of Bitcoin. This would result in a significant increase in adoption and hence price. Even if the amount in *bitcoin* (satoshis) earned by miners does not change significantly from the pre-LN era, the *value* (purchasing power)of those satoshis would be perhaps orders of magnitude higher (especially compared to onchain 'solutions' such as raising the block size to 10MB or something). Also, there is nothing stopping existing miners to become LN hubs themselves - especially since they are the most involved in the Bitcoin network.

Good question. They , of course, can,  as Bitcoin is open source software after all. However, when cloning Bitcoin - they would also clone its *decentralized* nature, which removes any special control they have over it anyway.
* A key thing about Bitcoin is that it removes the need to trust an institution/government for monetary policy,security and regulation. The security of the Bitcoin network is assured by a distributed network of 'miners'. You or I can also contribute to Bitcoins security by the process of 'mining'. 
* Even if a country decides to make its own cryptocurrency - the people may not and should not adopt it (for example, 'mine' it).
* Around a billion people use email today. It doesnt matter if you are in the adjacent room in my house or in the other side of the world. We can exchange emails ('information') just as easily. Bitcoin enables the exchange of 'value' just as easily. Currency conversions across nations are an economic inefficiency which Bitcoin disrupts. Thus, in the information age, a global kind of decentralized currency makes sense. For example, I am from India. You may be from anywhere in the world. We can economically interact easily with Bitcoin. Any 'national' currency conversion is an inefficiency for us, and for the world in general.
* The laws of mathematics is much superior to the laws of a nation/institution/bank. Would you rather trust math or a government ?

Banks wont make Bitcoin obsolete... Bitcoin makes banks obsolete !
Historically, banks were needed for some important economic functions : 
*  Clearing house : i.e. maintaining the authoritative ledger as to what transactions happened, who has what amount of money,etc.
*  Monetary Policy / Currency Issuance : deciding on the monetary base / supply. (Central banks).
*  Security : They would become responsible for security of your wealth against criminal actors.
Well, The Bitcoin Protocol has these features inbuilt , thus circumventing even the *need* for 'banks' or 'nations' or 'unions'.

This is a great idea, but its demands more time,effort and testing than possible in a weekend hackathon. The first step would be to spec it out properly in a whitepaper like document and freeze on the specs of an initial version.

Cheers from Bombay. Long live Bitcoin ! I would advise atleast a very basic dumbed down version of how and why bitcoin works. I had conducted a session in March (Bombay) and it took me around 30-45 mins to give a technical introduction to Bitcoin. 
(centralized vs decentralized -&gt; double spending problem -&gt; intro to crypto primitives and open source -&gt; blockchain -&gt; mining and its implications). Yup, it takes some time to explain, but once people 'get it', you have 'opened their minds'.
One might argue that the regular user should not be too concerned about implementation - @ that, tell 'em its for their own good - we are in the information age and its empowering to know, especially going forward in time.

Linux FTW ! I really think that the masses should somehow move to a decentralized OS before a decentralized currency. The linux desktop has come a long way now. It serves all my personal computing needs. If I still need some windoze program for work reasons - I just spin up a VM (virtualbox).

Thanks for your points. About Node, the callback hells can be avoided by using something like async.js, and using coffeescript instead of vanilla JS makes it look neat too. Having a lot of experience with node, I'm confident of the speed required for a weekend hack project. Although, we might just go with python too.
The split bill scene is indeed valid, but am looking at a web app sort of interface, not mobile app. Besides, the Bitcoin aspect of it is really quite simple.
I will also have a kickass webUI/SVG person .As of now, I'm kind of tripping on making a nice graphical educational representation of the Bitcoin network, the transaction process, etc. How does that sound ? For realtime web stuff, Node is quite up there.
Something like :
* Use Testnet for everything. (lol)
* Make the user make a BTC transaction
* Represent the transaction and blockchain mechanics as well as possible (kind of needs super UI skills)
* Explain the technicals in the process - the txn inputs,outputs,change, script signing,
* Make the 'aha' moment happen for atleast newbie CS background people somehow.
What I am envisioning is an interactive real time graphical web interface which shows technical details about the blockchain mechanics as the user is actually using the blockchain.
Will try to keep it realtime (socket.io ftw). One challenge is the SVG / graphics scene which I'm not that great at (I hope the person incharge is present and can pull it off), though I'm confident I can engineer everything else.

Ah , I can see where you are getting to, technically. But outside of the tech, wouldnt merchants A,B,C...N all need to agree on the interchangeability. For example, for simple quantification - say they all sell beer. All of them have issued coupons to you for say, 100 pints of beer. That means you are entitled to 100 * N pints of beer. You represent this as a single master 'coupon' called 'BombayCoupon' . For simplicity, lets say we issue 100 * N BombayCoupons to maintain 1:1 with a pint of beer. Now all of them are purchased by a Single user who prefers the beer that only Merchant A sells. He goes and tries to redeem everything there. For example, merchant A may not even have 100*N pints of beer...

Excellent stuff for the 'immediate' requirement... this should be able to scale up to n no of participants. But what if n is not well defined? Like a universally acceptable provable random no. that even later participants can agree was indeed random enough.
For non immediate requirements, one could wait till the next block is found , it could be some function of the next found block (should be standardized). This itself could have several usecases. 
The cases of standardizing a function/algorithm which can get m random bits are :
*  f(blockchain,n participants) - like you mentioned
* f(blockchain) - no. of parties does not matter / not required (is this even possible ?)
* f(nextblock) - for non immediate requirements

1. Yes, the 'tx' will happen in seconds. This will be a Level 2 'lightning' tx, not a typical BTC  (L1) tx.
2. No, it wont be registered on the (L1) blockchain and *wouldnt need to*.
Users would develop a new perspective of the L2 network over time (just as the L1 network perspective is sound now). IMO, Lightning is closer to the 'Internet of Money' narrative. Cheers.

The lightning clients will have an 'autopilot' mode in which channel management is automated - or you could switch to manual mode and override. Typically, the ideal goal is good automation so that lightning wallets are as easy to use as regular bitcoin wallets.
