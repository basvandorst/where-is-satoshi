I mean how insanely stupid you must be for thinking that a sample size of 3 is statistically good? xD
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:25:08


We're not talking about all of the points being identical, we're in fact talking about exactly 3 of the points coincidentally having a stronger than average tangent 365.24 days from each other. This is simply cherry picking data. It's 3 samples, and it shows because once you add another sample it already breaks down.

If people commit, orally or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that commitment because of establishing that idea or goal as being congruent with their self-image. Even if the original incentive or motivation is removed after they have already agreed, they will continue to honor the agreement.

Yea true, capitalism does.

I don't think they thought it. I think they just decided that a title like this will give them more clicks. Basic Journalism.

It is different from video game skins because those skins actually have a productive use (the creators of the skins creating nice stuff) whereas bitcoin does not.

If you can't handle discussion on a platform for discussion then I'm sure it's you who should leave.

I like how you think tax is a crime and at the same time things like streets, garbage, military, schools etc should be free for you. Really gets to show how insanely stupid you are :)

Whether direct or indirect, what does it matter? You're still supporting a good cause.


And bitcoin simply isn't money.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:50:48
Oh right, sorry you didn't. But the conclusions are still right, are they? You believe everyone should give you everything for free.

Clearly bitcoin isn't for anyone who wants to do something with it you mean.

I didn't say you have to buy war stuff and yes it may be a good cause if you believe that it is, who am I to judge.


Not really, no.

Actually it differs from stocks in the point that stocks actually finance something (company projects, etc) while bitcoin has no actual value to society / economy whatsoever.

says the dude who thinks that it's unfair that he has to pay for streets, garbage trucks, water, etc. Just go back to your bubble. You clearly have a problem with other people not sharing your crazy opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:38:16


Because you create the demand?


What argument? Money implies that I can buy stuff with it; something I can't do with bitcoin.
