Why do you think Satoshi abandoned bitcoin?  Replacing central entities like banks with ASIC manufacturers totally defeats the purpose of cryptocurrency.  The power structure of the existing financial system is merely shifted from financial firms (banks) to tech firms (Bitmain).
I'd wager a bet that Bitmain is a moderator of this subreddit.

The vertcoin team makes no secret that they do not care about price movements and in my opinion this scares away "investors" from the network.  
This seems to be the attitude Google wants from its cryptocurrency users, i.e. do not use Youtube to make promotional material for a crypto network that could be used to make investment decisions.

interesting point.  i need to give this some thought.  but i still think Bitmain has centralized mining to the point of destroying the central premise of decentralization.  Bitmain cannot be trusted to not act in their own self interests, yet the BTC community is OK with them dominating the mining of the blockchain.  I just dont get it.

see the links I posted.
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:23:41
So decentralization, like Satoshi (you know the creator of BTC) explains, is no longer vital to cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:25:57
well fair enough, after being insulted and belittled for asking a question, I got my answer.  Centralization of mining, to a handful of large, powerful entities is embraced by the Bitcoin community.  Bitmain and other ASIC manufacturers are the new version of the banks.  So much for creating a revolutionary financial system.
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:26:04
Centralized mining is equivalent to the existing power structure that Banks have.  How does a coin which is centrally mined change the financial system?
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:27:11
According to  Bitmain is on verge of financial ruin.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:47:11
what is your opinion on Vertcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:22:04
interesting.  Personally, since I think mining blockchains should be something an ordinary person should be able to do I would be happy to see Bitmain and other ASIC manufacturers fold.
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:26:51
Well, isnt cryptocurrency supposed to be built on decentralization?  Bitmain has centralized the mining of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Totally defeats the intended purpose of cryptocurrency.  Bitmain is the new bank.

So I am failing to understand.  you say they are not making a profit but the article says they had 2.5 billion in revenue and 1.25 billion in profit.  Are you being sarcastic?
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:26:23
Care to substantiate this with something I can read?  I'd love for this to be the case.
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:43:02
help me understand then.  BTC is forked and BCH, BTG, BTCP are spawned.  so whats not original about BTC?
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:56:26
I'd be happy to read up on this.  Please provide some sources.  Much appreciated.
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:00:05
lol.  it is a legit question, not trolling at all.
If decentralization is so important to cryptocurrencies, why does the Bitcoin community tolerate centralized mining?
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:52:37
haha.  Love the insults.  Keep them coming.  
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:00:51
So what about centralized mining, being controlled by an unethical company?
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:54:25
right, but I am referring to the original Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:54:39
So centralized mining is OK then?
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:06:18
i appreciate the reply.  but an ordinary person cannot participate in mining the coin without spending millions of dollars to buy second rate ASIC's from bitmain.  its just not right.  The whole purpose was to create a trustless financial system and Bitmain has proven they cannot be trusted.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:51:52
I've provided two examples already.  If you chose to ignore them, then that is on you.  And it is a legit question.  Have you read the Bitcoin whitepaper?  1 CPU = 1 vote.  Somewhere BTC followers lost site of the fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:28:14
I get that the hashrate will decrease, but right now Bitcoin mining is totally centralized.  And centralized by a highly unethical company.  Consumer grade hardware, PoW mining is the way to go, like Vertcoin.
