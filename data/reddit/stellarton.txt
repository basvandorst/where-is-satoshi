All of these other coins with their quicker transactions going up in price every day. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:09:51
To the point where transaction fees come down and people can't keep saying "Bitcoin can't scale".
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:43:06
That is way too late. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:16:09
Can you say Narcissist much!!!
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:01:10
The 11th. But what time? What if there is no decision? What time will we know there is no decision? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:18:31
So what do you think will happen when this withdrawel is lifted?
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:42:05
Read it somewhere on the Internet :)
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:49:40
Thank you

Thank you
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:52:05
So you are saying they can currently sell the btc for fiat? They just can't move the btc? 
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:11:08
Does that mean 12:01 am on the 11th? Or Midnight on the 11th? 
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:42:33
Link is higher up in the thread from CoinDesk 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:20:34
It is a famous thread on bitcoin talk. Guy misspelled Hold
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:17:18
OK well you just said yourself if they withdraw they would withdraw by the 10th. So they don't withdraw by midnight on the 10th it went through. If we go with conventional logic that they withdraw because they're told it didn't go through
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:25:14
A decision equals approval.if it was rejected they would've withdrawn
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:49:52
Ok thank you. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:51:31

Yes but aren’t they ignored if they don’t?
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:14:18

@_date: 2017-07-26 16:53:16
Such a joke
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:53:38

@_date: 2019-05-26 19:47:28
What do you mean

Don’t be a kill joy
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:37:34
Yes bulls hit. Can’t wait for crypto moms speech scheduled for that day at the etf conference to usher it in .
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:13:30
