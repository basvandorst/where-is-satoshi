I don't understand why this isn't upvoted more. Sean's Outpost to me is one of the strongest counterpoints to "people only use bitcoins for drugs" back before overstock.com or other online sites start accepting them. On another note, Sean's Outpost has the inversed "promised delivery time" as Butterfly Labs. Always exceeding expectations. Where else can you find a charity with this kind of efficiency?

Yea, that would have been bad back when BTC was over 200 and this subreddit was filled with memes. I'm glad thats over. But I think omnibrain had the best option which was to use a chrome extension. It wouldnt be fair to everyone who wouldnt want to see the price so there goes the reddit ticker idea. Worth a shot though.

I actually gave this article a fair chance and went to the first bullet point. Only 21million bitcoins exist. Mr. Journalist, you sure did you homework. That is indeed correct. But, did you know that 1 bitcoin can be divided into 1 million Satoshis? 
I stopped reading. 
Edit: 100,000,000 Satoshi per BTC. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:40:26
Now that I've actually had to look. 5850s can go about 350M/hashes. There are 4 for an estimate of 1400 so I'm still not sure where this article is getting that number. 
For reference 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:34:28
In addition to this, the fee is trivial compared to credit card companies and banks. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the fee is based on how much data being transferred rather than the value of the transaction. So sending 1 BTC to 100 addresses should required a higher fee than 100 BTC to 1 address. That being said, the fee is optional but don't expect your transaction to be as fast. 
For point 2, this is pretty important. When BTC is even bigger than it is now (accepted everywhere), there is going to be a huge number of transactions everyday. These transactions need to be computed/handled somewhere and thats where the miners come in. It's an incentive (after there are 21m BTC) to keep the hashpower of the network strong. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 15:11:55
I don't think they are. A minimum they sent out 20 boxes to different people, and even if one individual had 5, that would be 5GH*5 for 25GH. That is nowhere near 500GH so I'm sure its just someone trolling.

1. There are 21 million BTC but they can be broken down into Satoshis where 100,000,000 satoshis = 1 BTC. These coins do not disappear, someone else buys them on an exchange. A site like Coinbase, takes your bitcoins for USD, and holds on to them. Someone else can buy these BTC for USD. How does the network know? Bitcoin is a giant peer2peer network where the information and control is decentralized. When a transaction is made, it is passed along the network and eventually everyone will have this data. This is why there are "confirmations" when making transactions.
2. Look at 1. BTC do no gradually reduce. Though in the case of Dread Pirate Roberts and the Silk Road, it's possible that his booty will be locked away forever. Real life treasure hunt.
3. Look at point 1. If it were only 21million, then yes. Otherwise, its 2,100 trillion units which is comparable/more to/than any kind of currency we have today.

For those who need a ELI5, look at the comments of the post, there will be more explanations of what is trying to be accomplished. 
Key points:
* The thief used something called a tumbler, more info at 
* Analogy in one of the comments: Imagining putting a red sock in a load of 96000 white ones. The load will come out pink.
* Every time the tumbler service is used, they charge a fee. So every time the thief tries to lose his tail, he needs to pay.
* Noone is getting their BTC back. 
* We can know everything about the 96000BTC that was stolen. All the BTC is traced.
* It depends on the community to never let the thief spend his money else they can identify the thief.

Tulip Mania was the scenario that Bitcoin was thought to be in during the April bubble. The reason why is because there were alot of questions against Bitcoin's actual validity. At the time around March, you could spend bitcoin but not at many place. Bitcoin was thought to only be used for the Silk Road. People thought BTC was built upon Silk Road and thought it would crash, but it was only a hiccup and from that point BTC was actually starting to seem like a legitimate currency. More and more places started accepting BTC and today, this rise in price isn't considered as much as a bubble as it was in April. 
TL:DR Tulip Mania was how the April bubble was described. Today, the analogy isn't as strong.

You used to be able to on btct.co. It was a exchange where you can buy virtual stock for companies like SatashiDice (Gambling site) or ASICminer (Pooled ASIC mining shares). It was "virtual" and theoretically, someone could just run away with all your BTC but that wasn't why it went down. It didn't follow US regulations and couldn't get the licenses to run. The site was trustworthy and completely legitimate. 
Here is a fun disclaimer from btct.co: "* This is a virtual stock exchange using virtual currency. Virtual goods utilized on this site are for entertainment and educational purposes only."
TL;DR, there used to be.

Just to be clear, I didn't read any of the other points. I started with point 1 and the argument is that because there are only 21mil BTC, that people should horde them/there are not enough coins for 7bil people. If the smallest unit was BTC and there is only 21mil, then this is a valid point. If the author did his research, he/she would understand that this isn't the case because there are 21,000,000,000,000 Satoshi's or 21 trillion units which is about twice $10.5 trillion dollars. I'm not reading the rest of the article solely on the fact that the benefit of doubt given to give it a fair read, was taken away in the very first point when a bold statement was made on something that wasn't accurately/properly presented.
It doesn't matter what my prediction is or if the journalist had a valid point. The research was off and I have lost trust in the article. 
Note/Edit: The reason for this kind of harshness is because of the lack of research many journalist do when posting articles specifically about bitcoins. There has been a lot of controversial/poorly written articles because people want ad views/attention.
Edit: 100,000,000 Satoshi's per BTC which further invalidates the point that BTC needs to be horded.

I think you are missing my point. I don't care about what the argument was because of the failure to recognize that 1BTC can be broken up into 100,000,000,000,000 units for the stated 7,000,000,000 people on earth. If someone doesn't present information objectively, I can't trust the argument.

Personally I think its great that these "early adopters" are people who sold drugs. Kudos for them to use a new technology that most people dismissed and did not give the time and effort to understand. Also, I would prefer for these "early adopters" to be rich than their other counterparts. BTC, has created a free market for drugs where there never has been before. That means no territories, no needs for gangs, and less incentive for fixing prices through violence. 
Good job to those who saw the use of bitcoins and it's legitimacy before anyone else believed.

21 million bitcoins divisible into 100,000,000 Satashis. 
From the wiki
How are new bitcoins created?
Number of bitcoins over time, assuming a perfect 10-minute interval.
New bitcoins are generated by the network through the process of "mining". In a process that is similar to a continuous raffle draw, mining nodes on the network are awarded bitcoins each time they find the solution to a certain mathematical problem (and thereby create a new block). Creating a block is a proof of work with a difficulty that varies with the overall strength of the network. The reward for solving a block is automatically adjusted so that roughly every four years of operation of the Bitcoin network, half the amount of bitcoins created in the prior 4 years are created. 10,500,000 bitcoins were created in the first 4 (approx.) years from January 2009 to November 2012. Every four years thereafter this amount halves, so it will be 5,250,000 over years 4-8, 2,625,000 over years 8-12, and so on. Thus the total number of bitcoins in existence will never exceed 21,000,000. See Controlled Currency Supply.

They are selling 2 preorders of BFL Mini rigs for a total of 3000GH/s vs Avalon's 70GH/s. The major major major major difference is that BFL has yet to ship anything besides a few 5/GH machines over the past month when they were supposed to ship all of their products early this year. The predicted shipment of the 1500GH/s Mini Rigs is pretty much up in the air. Maybe after summer? Maybe next year? Maybe never... 
That being said, the Avalon machine is real and ready to be shipped. As time goes on, every day wasted is a wasted day for mining and the difficulty will always increase to the point where even having 5GH/s will be non profitable.

@_date: 2013-04-26 14:29:13
When did you order? If you ordered this year than the likely-hood of making good profit is less. People who preordered at the start and will be getting their Jalapenos soonish should be making some money but not like the Avalon batch  owners (in terms of $/GH) due to the increasing difficulty. 
There is always this. 
Some people estimate that in Fall when (if) all the predicted ASICS are released, we may be seeing a difficulty of 80M. Does that sound absurd? Whether it is or isn't, pop in your numbers and see for yourself. 
If I got my Jalapeno in Fall, at 88M difficulty and bought my product before the price increase ($160ish), I would break even at 36 days.
Factors:  
Difficulty at time received  
Price of BTC when received  
Place in Order queue  
Other companies releasing ASICs

If not, then yes, it could be a great idea but I don't know of many things that would need alot of computational power besides research for space and protein.

Camp bx is okay. I always felt the interface was kind of meh. But I've never had a lag problem with it maybe due to its smaller volume than MtGox and its usually as up to date as MtGox. If you like the interface, go for it. It also excepts Dwolla fairly quickly without verification unlike MTgox's 2 week wait. 
That being said, I heard alot of exchanges just received funding. We may be seeing new robust trade sites very very soon.

I think I stopped reading after his "Update 2:" where he took completely wrong information and used it in his calculation, then tried to continue pushing his now invalid point with the correct information.
Edit: I thought I might as well put why I thought this. If the highest-visibility brand accepting bitcoin is only netting $100s in profit (which doesn't make sense anyway), then it would be okay to assume that all other companies accepting bitcoin would be making less than that, under the assumption that the highest visibility brand would have the most profit. If the profit was really $100, I would be okay with the article stating a "vast overvaluation" because those tiny numbers wouldn't make a dent in the market as a whole.  
After the update 2, (and 1), the author uses the not highest visibility brand which now has profits in the tens of millions, but continues to use the assumptions from the original article. We are no longer talking about 100s of dollars as originally miscalculated. Could bitcoin be overvalued? It's possible but this article doesn't have the calculations or data to even prove that. But as far as I know it's definitely not vastly overvalued.
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:29:01

I'm in the same boat. Seems like the customer service is trying to not honor the price for obvious reasons (initially at least) but they need to have a better system to let you know if your order will be cancelled or not.

Don't forget that they are also back-up because of everyone trying to buy BTC right now.

It depends on the ROI. GPUs and CPUs are notoriously power hungry. If the price of bitcoin outweighs the bitcoins you can earn per unit of power, then yes, it would be viable. Currently, its far from that. My GPU can mine at 200MH/s at 150W of power. According to the bitcoin calculator, I'm losing money. In the beginning, it was a different story because they were the early adopters who took on risk, knowing that they could be mining at a loss. The difficulty hike outweighs the increase in value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:52:54
Depends on how they sold it. If they cashed out gradually, the Bitcoin market may still be on it's way to the moon. I think if they cashed out their   initial 11mil of BTC all at once, they could drop MtGox's price a few hundred. That would probably cause panic and the "bubble" would burst.

To be honest, I think the trading sites are all going through changes in the past month. MtGox had the whole lawsuit and the Dwolla issue.
