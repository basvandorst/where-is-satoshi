"Why don't we increase block size" because that's exactly what bitcoin cash is and hur dur that's bad and not really bitcoin. You can't keep increasing block size forever so why do it at all.

i advise you directly contact them and ask there position on bitcoin in writing, ive heard horror storys about people opening uk accts only to have them closed the second money for btc starts flowing. it may be pretty obvious that the account is for btc but banks can be pretty oblivious in the yes we will take your money stage of opening a business account

hey love the site, just waiting on some polish before i move the majority of my coins there. do you plan on supporting QT bitcoin trader and more importantly do you plan on organizing your verification steps? seriously i cant make heads or tails of it. i think i submitted everything but i have no idea.

i couldnt get to part 2, he was so repetitive, i get it you only need 2 of 3 keys
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:09:59
the information is not what changes the price, its the idea that people with different bits of information bet against each other. (ie insider trading)
@_date: 2013-09-30 02:57:02
BECAUSE BABY STEPS BRO! you gotta walk before you run. and imo i know ill get DVed but fuck ltc, its basicly btc thats been tweeked. let btc go through the crucible first and become an accepted technology before flooding and confusing the not so tech savy public

Can we please just grow bit coin naturally, try to make bitcoin grow just because its better, not use it as a weapon against the system. I feel a slow steady transition that takes many years would be much better for the whole financial ecosystem.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:06:43
whats the point of the passphrase then? (honest question)
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:36:18
its really not as much power as you think, 33.5m is a drop in the hat for big gov. if the gov wanted to fuck with bitcoin it wouldnt need to touch it at all, just drown it in regulation
@_date: 2013-09-17 21:36:28
Damn dude im sorry I really just don't see it as good vs evil nor would I put my hard earned money in a fight is what this is really about. And yea cryto currency has the potential to do everything fiat can but it needs time to grow and non of that is going to happen if we turn this is to a battle and start labeling people and ideas. Open and honest discussion about shortcoming and strengths if different strategies to improve the situation will do alot more good alot faster than waging a battle of good vs evil, I would go so far as to say that it would be counter productive.
@_date: 2013-09-17 19:00:24
Im a realist, I understand your point of "fuck the system man burn that shit" but a mass exodus and burning that shit down looks alot shittier when you consider our current system while not perfect keeps children learning, technology advancing, and doctors saving people with medicine, and not to mention a pretty good quality of life compared to just 2 generations ago. So I see your "fuck the system" ideals but ultimately we can only move on to a more civilized better system by smoothly transitioning to a better one. A mass exodus/attack on the current system will only make the push back even stronger.

honestly dude, after your golden shower (first time i heard of  your service, it was outside the box advertising but really unprofessional imo and i didnt learn anything about your exchange besides its run by some dude on reddit) and now this post (which sounds really desperate) i dont think ill be taking the first step into your exchange, too much bad ju ju to risk thousands of $$$...
@_date: 2013-09-18 13:25:23
Thank you for being reasonable

im pretty sure your donating to the continued used of opiates for someone else, sorry cant upvote this one
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:05:22
Yea its worth a shot, im just tired of people complaining about coinbase, it seems alot of users have unreasonable expectations of there service! They are a wallet service!!! Don't expect real time trading or them to reimburse you for sending coins without checking (especially if it auto completes like come on dude its like clicking send in a txt message without reading what you wrote! I'd like to think most bitcoiners are at least a little bit more tech savy then drunk college students!!)
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:35:19
haha its gonna take alot more than adam from coinbase to make that happen 
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:28:18
highly unlikely, you think ross really was smart enough to think all of these small details through when he was running the worlds largest online black market? dont get me wrong hes obviously an intelligent guy but he is only one person and human.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:25:57


i dont know what you mean, ive been here 2 months and i know its not smart to leave 10k in an account without 2fa if anything the community is pushing info. maybe after seeing 4 of these posts a week, we just dont feel like giving them attention and repeating the same thing "2fa" 
ive yet to see a post about someone loosing money 2fa
@_date: 2013-09-13 17:26:14
Ahh, your right. I was high risk, any word on how to make this not happen?

in terms of the young bitcoin ecosytem yes, this is exactly what im advocating
@_date: 2013-10-12 04:11:09
you were never charged for those coins and the order you made while the price was fluctuating rapidly was canceled and your complaining? sounds like you need to use campbx as a trader and not coinbase as an exchange which they are not.
