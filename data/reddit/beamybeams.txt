@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:40
very good explained. just 1 line makes me think about the future:


lets say in 20 years everyone will have their wealth in cryptos. how to deal with that kind of safety like some bad peeple can rob or kidnap anyone and torture them until they tell them the key or tell them where key is stored. i know that can happen now also with someones bank account. but dealing with banks leaves more traces  than cryptos so thieves could rob us more easy from cryptos if they force key. correct?

yes those are some qualities of gold. blockchain also has qualities. some banks even say they want to use blockchain for some financial applications. while thats not directly bitcoin, it means there is a value in it. yes gold doesnt need electricity. bitcoin does. but gold needs mines, trucks to transport, roads, vaults with heavy security, people who melt it and do quality control, etc. bitcoin does not need those.  does that mean gold is no value? no it means both have their own types of values. see the broader picture.

hmmm wasnt usd and most currencies born out of papers that promised a trade, example corn farmer traded with a veggie farmer but when 1 farmer couldnt make the trade they made a paper that for example was worth x amount of corn, over time there were so many trade papers that they picked a material as common trade value , i think it was gold . sorry bit rough description but thats how i learned where money comes from. but thats not the case with bitcoin , or is it?
edit : found it = 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:14:09
really thats how its started?? i dont get it, so it grew value all up from a tiny bit? and what made that 1st person put money into it? i mean it was nothing then, no one used it and no security of return
anyway thanks for reply
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:27:31

@_date: 2017-11-24 17:46:41
ah. so anyone can start a new crypto currency? thats neat
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:41:37
he bought them after a friend suggested it, so he wasnt following it up in the first place. also not everyone has same priorities regarding whats valuable and whats not. i think this guy gave more value to bikes than a internet investment

i have handfull of friends who never ever touch internet or news. they just value other things in life like art / traveling / partying . in this OPs case the guy likes bikes. i dont say the story is true but its very possible. 
example, one of my friends we were in the supermarket at cashier and he always pays in cash. cash from bank desk, not from atm. he ownes a debit card. but never used it in its electronic way. to get money all he did was show card with his ID to the bank employee to get cash. at market cashier he said to me he had no cash so if i could borrow him $5. i told him he could pay electronicaly. he told me he didnt know that was possible. i was shocked xD . i showed him how but he didnt know his pincode, obviously since he never used it once. i paid the groceries. this was 2016. he is a working adult so not a kid or so.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:47:36

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:23:28

crypto makes that 1 central group cant control the value, crypto makes that 1 central group cant control who is allowed to do big transactions or not, crypto makes that there is a underlying value, trough mining and limited coins.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:59:59
