You have the right to do whatever you want, but you have to understand that everything in the world that promotes liberty, be it software or laws or whatever, also helps the "bad guys". It's a necessary evil. The net effect of technologies like Tor and BitTorrent is overwhelmingly positive. DarkMarket will be the same.

If this were actually the reason then other non-psychedelic drugs wouldn't be illegal. This is just circlejerk garbage. The real reason has nothing to do with "opening your mind" and everything to do with politicians catering to the people that believe drug use is somehow immoral.

I went out of my way to specify that it was a lesser example. Just because the two are not of the same magnitude does not mean that there aren't striking similarities. I don't appreciate you calling me disrespectful because of your own deliberate misinterpretation.


It doesn't require insubordination. As I already said cops can and do use their discretion in cases like these.


If you were talking about me brandishing a weapon in public I would agree, but what I was doing affected nobody but myself. Because I was the only affected party, nobody else has a legitimate say in the matter. The idea that any government can have a say in what you do *when it only affects you* is toxic and needs to be stamped out.


Not every law exists for a valid reason. You are clearly under the delusion that laws are unchanging, absolute, and unquestionable holy words set forth with the best intentions by the morality gods themselves. They're not, and I am under no obligation to have a "damn good reason" to break the laws that should never have been written in the first place.
Why do you keep insisting that I have to make myself a full-blown martyr if I'm going to break an unjust law? The people that stand up and take the shit are to be respected of course, but the people that don't shouldn't receive the opposite treatment. Snowden hasn't come back to the US to face the unjust charges against him; does that somehow make what he did a bad thing? Absolutely not.

We're in agreement then. I don't know why you're arguing. My point is that the article (or at least the half referencing Circle) is implying that Circle users won't know or care that they're using bitcoin, which simply isn't true.


This on the other hand... It honestly sounds like you're trying to say that people using Circle will never get burned on the USD/BTC ratio... There is most certainly a chance of getting burned.

100% agree. I was surprised to read those few lines when I got to the end of the article. It's almost like the author completely disregarded everything he had just said. I guess I can't really blame him though, it takes quite a bit to shake off the "drugs are bad mmkay" brainwashing and he seems to be at least moving in the right direction.
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:22:58
This isn't true. Circle lets me purchase $500/week instantly whether via ACH or credit card; Coinbase lets me purchase $1000/week instantly via ACH. The only things Circle has going for it are its sometimes lower fees and the ability to buy with a credit card. I'm not so sure that the ability to buy with a credit card is even much of a benefit given that Circle passes on the credit card fees to the buyer. Who wants to pay a ~2.9% premium when they could just hook up a bank account?
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:56:42

This shit is getting ridiculous. While I agree that theymos has made some pretty questionable decisions on the topic, the reaction in this sub has been appalling.
1. Saying "we" is disingenuous and inflammatory. How many of you actually donated? I know I didn't. Hell, how many of you even use bitcointalk? My guess is not many since you're here on Reddit.
2. A broken page/security hole on a personal website isn't relevant no matter what point you're trying to make. You're cherry-picking and again, it is unnecessarily inflammatory. The new forum isn't even written in PHP for fuck's sake. Anyone is free to check out the project on github and criticize *that* instead.

There. Happy?
Bitcoin may have existed in a regulatory vacuum in its infancy, but the only reason it did is because nobody thought it was important enough to regulate. Now it is. It was inevitable.

You are really naive if you think that any of that makes a damn bit of difference in this case.

No, what I'm saying is that even if someone were buying heroin with the coins they had sitting on SR at the time and they got them back (ignore the likelihood that they wouldn't) they wouldn't necessarily be charged with anything, and if they were charged with something they wouldn't necessarily be admitting guilt by requesting the coins back.
If we go by common sense, you're absolutely right. But the law isn't always about common sense.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:50:22

This isn't as huge as you think. People in California were already openly ignoring this law and there was never a threat of it being enforced. The recent run up is almost certainly correlated with the auction. The initial buy that pushed us to 620 was probably the result of a whale or whales with insider info on the auction.

Exactly how I feel. Even if the bad cops are a minority (I believe they are, although by significantly less of a margin than they should be) they have a responsibility to weed out the bad apples in their ranks.

I'm still not sure if that means he would get to keep the proceeds in the million-to-none chance that he is acquitted or if the feds would still hold them.
Perhaps most interesting about this is that it was signed on January 27th, 2014. Nearly 10 months ago. The feds were given complete discretion in the date of the sale(s) and even if they decided to sell at all.
Personally I find it hard to believe that Ulbright would have signed off on this without some kind of incentive. Whether that was a carrot or a stick I'm not sure. The document mentions the reason for the sale: "Government and Ulbricht agree that, due to the volatile market for bitcoins, the Computer Hardware Bitcoins risk losing value during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings." My question is, would Ulbright actually care about the volatility of the market? He knows his chances of going free are low and even if the exchange rate goes completely against him he's still a multi-millionaire.

This is an especially relevant experience for me. Cops have a lot of discretion when it comes to minor offenses like underage drinking. I've had several people tell me that they got off scott-free for obvious underge drinking offenses; one was even driving at the time. And yet I was ticketed and forced to pay an exorbitant amount of money simply for walking (*not* driving or doing anything disruptive) home drunk when I was 19. The cop that ticketed me was knowingly participating in a (legalized) scheme to extort money from underage students for the benefit of the local government. In a similar vein, a close friend of mine was ticketed for underage drinking less than a week before his 21st birthday. As with me, he just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Quite frankly, I don't care that what the cop did was "legal" or that he was "just doing his job". If you are blindly following orders that you know to be unjust then you are not a person worthy of respect.

On top of that, bitcoin really hasn't reached the level where many organizations view it as a serious threat.

The pertinent question is, if somebody is paying people to post shitty parodies on are they getting their money's worth? I think the answer is a resounding no.

What I am saying is that it's the cop's fault for enforcing a law that they know to be unjust when they clearly have the opportunity to *not* enforce the law.
As another poster pointed out, it's a (lesser) example of the Geneva defense. Just because you are "doing your job" does not make what you're doing right, especially when you have the opportunity to not do it.
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:48:44
The Geneva/Nuremburg defense is a defense used by war criminals in the [Nuremberg trials]( Many of the defendants claimed that they were just doing what was ordered of them by their superiors (which was killing Jews, etc). Obviously they were not in the right even though they were following the letter of their country's law and the orders of their superiors. Myself and many others would argue that there are similarities to the "War on Drugs" where a majority of members of government are persecuting drug users unjustly.
I do fault the police officer (although less so than I fault the establishment that enacted the laws the police officer enforces) because it was entirely within his power to not enforce a law that he knew was unjust. I am not obligated to have a "good reason" to break an unjust law and my intentions are no less pure if I am unwilling to face unjust punishment. The only obligation is on my government to correct said unjust law. If you can't accept that then I'm afraid we can't have a productive discussion on this topic.

As much as I hate how reddit's voting system seems to encourage groupthink, every time I visit a more traditional forum (arguably the only real alternative to reddit) I'm reminded that the voting system is still a net positive. Bitcointalk is a classic example. For every post worth reading there are 10 that aren't. This is undoubtedly true on reddit as well, but at least some of the noise gets filtered out via the voting system.
It's easy to complain about reddit but I doubt you can find a better alternative on the same scale. Why would you be here if you had?

Chill out dude. I said that because if Circle is really targeting people who don't even know they're using bitcoin (like this article suggests) then they are going to expect that $10 in their account to remain $10.
Obviously nobody is going to complain if it becomes worth $11, but there's a pretty good chance it could fall to $9 too. People that are used to dealing exclusively in fiat won't be happy about that. It's not all appreciation all the time.

Based on nothing. He's dealing in absolutes where there are none. There are sellers that escrow would be perfectly acceptable for, and there are sellers where it wouldn't be.

I believe I already addressed the question you're alluding to in the other replies to my initial comment, but: 
1. If you have money to burn there are far better ways to fuck with bitcoin. This is the biggest point by far.
2. Assuming you ignore  I would expect a well funded counter-bitcoin initiative to be--well, better. What have the folks over at actually accomplished?
3. It's not even necessary at this point. Bitcoin has enough issues that people outside of don't see it as a serious threat.
The most likely explanation for the people that I frequently see being called paid shills is that they are simple trolls. Even the most non-polarizing topics have them and bitcoin is anything but.

Mass exposure to bitcoin doesn't equal organizations viewing it as a significant threat. I would go even further and say that bitcoin was more of a threat pre-SR 1.0 implosion than it is now. The last year or so has proved that even with a good chunk of the population aware of it bitcoin isn't getting off the metaphorical launchpad quite yet. If any organization out there was worried they are undoubtedly less-so now that the general public has indicated their disinterest.
edit: None of this to say that bitcoin hasn't taken great strides in the last year (I am long-term bullish as well); it's just pretty apparent to me that there is a lot more work to be done before most people will take bitcoin seriously.

Well for one these markets have been around a lot longer than darkcoin or monero or whatever. Bitcoin is entrenched and it offers some obvious benefits over those newcomers: It's easier to get ahold of, safer from massive volatility (although still not that safe), etc. Beyond all that though bitcoin is "good enough" for privacy and getting better (with darkwallet and similar services).

It's not that it doesn't make a difference, it's that anything that can realistically happen in the next few months is too little too late for Ross.
In this case he's been formally charged with:
* narcotics trafficking
* distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet
* conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent identification documents
* narcotics trafficking conspiracy
* continuing criminal enterprise
* computer hacking conspiracy
* money laundering conspiracy
What makes you think that marijuana being legal in a few more states or a new attorney general will have a serious bearing on this case? To be let off on the narcotics charges alone the government would have to declare that all drugs are now legal and that they can be bought and sold outside of any regulatory framework. I don't see that happening in years much less months.

To be fair, I highly doubt WalMart is paying their suppliers with a credit card (which is where the 3% fee comes from). It is probably some kind of AHC/wire transfer thing and while the fees on those are still worse than Bitcoin, they aren't anywhere near 3% (depending on size of the transaction, which i imagine is quite high).

I understand what you're getting at here but you seem to be having your cake and eating it too with this statement. If WalMart is really committed to offering the lowest possible price they'll most certainly pass along that 3% to customers.
Of course they aren't really committed to that, they're committed to making money. Since their whole business model revolves around making money by being the cheapest option, they'll probably have to pass along that 3% savings if/when one of their competitors does.
