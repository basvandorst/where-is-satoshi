My point is that the money spent on and by the government also provides education, infrastructure, social security, defense, science funding. The money spent on securing bitcoin is useless except for securing bitcoin. So yes, if you are calculating how much of each dollar spent goes to securing your currency, bitcoin is more efficient, but that's like saying a pocket calculator is better than a high-end PC for computing because a pocket calculator spends 100% of its energy on computing while a computer wastes energy on heat, displaying a gui, running and OS, etc.
It's comparing apples to orangutans.

If it's not secure, what's the point? And even at its best, you only get 7 transactions per second. Even if the lightning network worked, there wouldn't be enough capacity to open channels for everyone currently using actual currency.

All of those things have uses outside of backing the currency. Mining bitcoin is useless outside of backing the currency. You can't compare the two.

Constant growth?

Looking up the linden dollar exchange rates, it seems between 2008 and 2017 it varied between 240 and 270 per dollar, which is remarkably stable for a virtual currency, heck it would be pretty stable for a real currency

Nobody wants another bailout, but if there was another crisis, it's preferable over letting banks fail

You're right in the sense that they used less than 700B for the bailout, because they ended up not needing that much. In the end, TARP recovered funds totalling $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested. So the government made a 15 billion profit from the bailout in interests.

Freedom to do what? What can't you do now that you would be able to do with more freedom and privacy?

Stealing, fraud, drug dealing, it's not that complicated.

You realise they didn't get to keep the money, right? They paid it back with interest

gambling is okay if you know it's gambling. The danger comes from thinking you're investing but it turns out it's actually a gamble.
