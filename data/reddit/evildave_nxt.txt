One of the most original and oldest alts, to be truthful.
Nxt has been running solidly since 2013, so take a look, if you haven't already:

Amen to that.
I'm slightly involved in the Drachmae project from the NXT end, and there are a couple of points being made here that I'd like to address:
Nautiluscoin was indeed developed by Brian Kelly, who is backing the Drachmae project. BK wanted to include the NAUT community within Drachmae, so it's being used for the initial trial on the island of Agristi. (see the article). The project doesn't really need NAUT (being brutally honest, any token would do), but BK does have some loyalty to the NAUT community.  
Drachmae isn't just about NAUT: there is a consortium of crypto projects involved, which will provide additional blockchain-based services to the project. In theory, the project could be escalated to include governance functions like voting, financial transparency and tax collection, on a local or even national scale. Not just yet, though. Testing first........and a small, tourist economy island is a good place to start.
The use of gold backing for Nautilus/Drachmae has, so far, only been discussed, and mostly as a way of getting financial conservatives on board with crypto-currency. The old guard still believes in 'backing' a currency, even if we don't.
Lastly: the idea behind Drachmae is not to immediately replace the entire Greek economy with crypto-currency, but to provide (intially) an alternative crypto-based income stream to Greek businesses.....the idea is that tourists will be able to bring their crypto-currency to Greece, spend it there, and this crypto income will act as a stimulant for the wider development and acceptance of crypto in the Greek economy.
