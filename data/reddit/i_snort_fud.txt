Feels good to have gotten into the crypto space this early. Have been saving for a few years and have gotten a allocation I can live with for the next 5-10 years. 75%BTC because I just don't see it disappearing and the whole "so and so has better tech" is just as much speculative and means nothing.
Crypto is money, store of value, a way to tokenize assets, ensure trust and will be as much apart of our lives as the internet has been the last few decades.
Let's all be chill. I'm graduating college soon and starting my career soon. Which means more Fiat to trade for crypto. Have a good time boys (and ladies). If you're feeling stress about your bags just go outside or do anything else productive. The amount of negative vibes and hostility here is actually pretty disheartening.

Somebody correct me here if I'm getting this wrong.
Let's say you traded .1 BTC for an one hypothetical alt coin. 
5 years later that alt coin is now worth .000001 BTC.
If I sell that coin back to BTC do I get to claim my loss in SATs as long term capital loss in the US?
Seems like if you hedge right, a speculative bet on an altcoin gone can greatly help with offsetting BTC gains.
So in summary if my $1000/BTC for one alt is now $.01/BTC can I claim $999.99 in losses?

What kind of life do you live where you get pleasure from trying to bring people down. Acting like life took one of your family members or something. Bro look in the mirror. You did this to yourself.

I see thanks for clearing that up for me

So many people upset. Average time in market seems like 1.5 years. Weak hand they are. This market has 4-5 year cycles. If you can't handle the ride than capitulate

She has done a lot of work helping her home state of Wyoming become crypto friendly. 
Would be cool if a crypto boom town sprung up there for all the HODL'rs to build their 3D printed houses.

Okay... what this sub anti margin or something? I'm a  grown ass man who knows what he is risking. Just seeing if anyone knows anything because it seems we(USA) can't use regular binance

Am I just a whore for letting BTC get my emotions all tangled up? I mean it hasn't got up this fast on me in awhile. I'm only 5% up for the month but it just feels so god damn good.
*Tries calling BTC to come over and give some more of that fat throbbing gains

DCA has definitely been a better strategy for me. Didn't start until April and have had a few FOMO's but I've learned and gotten an allocation I am comfortable withholding for years to come.  The next hardest thing is what to do next when the price goes up? I'm hoping to find a nice "money-market" account to earn a return and invest some in over-seas real-estate.

Where can US citizens margin trade without VPN's that's legit?

What happens if the car manufacture does a fork? Does a diamondback bike appear in the trunk?

Think this is because earnings season is happening? Whales moving gains from equity to BTC?

Thanks for the reply. Hopefully, with more developments there will be other ways to make passive income on Bitcoin. Maybe a coin pegged to BTC or something where we don't have to give up our keys. It makes sense for those holding multiple BTC though to use these services. If you have over 25 BTC than putting 2-3 away in a passive fund might be worth the risk.
Guess I'll HODL for now but just thinking something needs to happen in the next decade to make HODL worth it. Just don't see it being anything other than to transfer large amounts of wealth for the rich or for derivative gamblers. Just did the Coinbase lessons for free DAI and it seems something like that might be possible too for BTC.

I guess a bunch of weak handed noobs sold. Not convinced yet but this has given my morning wood some extra stiffness

BTC goes down on me but I don't bust my load. Just DCA more into her and let her do all the work. BTC is a cruel one boys
