It is possible to do and make money on the spread. But then you should be european. Because on gdax you trade in the currency of you area. So in theory I can deposit money on bitfinex and transfer the btc to gdax and making the 3-600$ spread. The main problem is that withrawlimit on gdax is 10k or just 0.8-0.9 bitcoin. And a bank transfer takes 1-4 days. So you need atleast 3-5 bitcoins if you are going to do this everyday. And then agan since the money is lockd in transaction you are not able to invest that money. So you lock yourself out of the marked. And tbh even thi its 300-600$ thats only 3-5% and thats not alot in the crypto world, and that is before transfer fee for btc and transfer fee for banks.

Tether m.cap is "only" 800mil, the total m.cap of crypto is 360 billion. Tether aint going to break the marked, but will give it a huge dip for some hours/days, and people holding tether will be screwed...

First of all you are talking about a flash crash not bringing the btc price down. You are talking about dumping btc worth 800mil in 0.1min and eating up all buy orders. That is not taking the price down, thats a flashcrash or a dump. If you did do that the marked recover fast. But the price will be lower ofc.
Second. Why people say tether is a scam: 1. the tether is not supported 1/1 with dollar so its a scam. 2. People say its a scam because of 1, and they say they print tether and pump up the price. 3. If they did print tether and buy btc and pump up the price, they would already have hundreds of millions in profits. 3. Tether is not a scam, people say tether gets printed when btc go down like you can easly see on the graph. But what is the reason tether is printed? Thats because people sell btc for dollar/USDT, and by that they are making more tether. And the overall cryptomarked is getting more money in so tether should increase over time.
Last. If tether is a scam and the value should be 1/1 but its realy 1/0 because the money is gone. That will just effect the people holding the tether. In other words that will not force the btc price down in theory. But it will do because people panic. Because 800mil is held in tether, that is basicly 800mil gone from the cryptoeconomy and the people that is holding the 800mil is screwed when the other people hold btc. The question is if this effect bitfinex or not. Anyway it will effect the marked because we are humans. And the best part is that if this go down, people will sell there btc for tether on exchanges because they dont know what they are doing on exchanges like bitfinex etc because you cant realy find information about it if your just a casuall/new investor.
Tl;DR you are talking about selling btc for 800mil in a flashcrash. If tether is a scam 800mil USD is gone, not 800mil worth of btc. Only people that is holding tether is screwed
Edit: and that is if we talk about btc, btc stands for like 50-60% of the overall marked

tl;dr korean exchanges are in generall more expensive. Some other countrys aswell. The reason is that its harder to move money in or out of the country.
You can even look at btc/euro on gdax that is trading at 11150 euro atm and that is 13100 dollars. And the price in dollars on gdax is 12.7k dollars and on bitfinex 12.5k dollars. Gdax and other more safe exchanges are in generall a bit more expensive. And yes it is possible to deposit on bitfinex and transfer it to gdax and take them out earning money. But then agan you have to pay fees, and moving money takes time.

I was watching the 4k dump on bitfinex. Placed a sell order at gdax at 9400 euro(11.1k$), but the greedy person Im I didnt want to pay fee so I sett it 0.1 higher then bid price...
The next sec gdax started to bug, the last thing I saw was somone placed a sell order at 7700 euro, probably a stop loss... 7700 aka 9100$. Somone is crying atm

I agree with you, but theres a difference between taking out a loan on btc and on a house.
Loans on houses in USA follows the house, if you take out a loan on BTC it follows you personally. Thats not good for the person, but for btc itself it dont realy do much. 
This can effect the btc price ofc, if people get scared or are forced to sell and the price go down. But this will not ruin the btc marked like it did to the housing marked in USA.
Anyway agree with you, people should think twice taking out loans. And if you do take a loan you should be able to pay it back from your other incomes and not planing on paying it back when btc have gone up 50%.
I belive the price will continue up because of "normal" people are being able to invest in btc via stock exchanges atm and in the future. But Im a bit scared about the fork and invest alot in bitcoin cash atm.

I remember when I first bought btc in 2013 and told myself "why didnt i start a year before"... 
I bet thats what new people say in 2017, and hopefully what new people will say in 2018 aswell.
