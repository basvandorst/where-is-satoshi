Not a good idea 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:53:14
This post really should be removed.. too many scams come out of India. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:08:32
You’re seriously alright with paying almost 20$ in fees? I think you should consider bch. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:13:09
Uhmm.. why wouldn’t you at least sell high and buy when it gets to zero? Duh. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:23:05
Core has continuously stalled on scaling blocks. LN is not secure. Fees have been high for a while now on btc; Became a problem as early as 2015. Their investors like AXA need to have an ROI - why do you think core wants high fees?

Stay safe, and good luck! It could be wrong, but it seems like the most likely scenario that will play out. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:29:26
You clearly don’t know anything about investing.. all I’m saying is be careful. Don’t take the advice if you don’t want, but don’t say no one warned you. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:47
Bitcoin devs are apart of blockstream, AXA funds them yes. And it seems to be heading the way of centralization - to me it already is. It is a huge threat, and totally goes against what the original bitcoin was meant to be. Have you read the white paper? It doesn’t describe what bitcoin is now, bitcoin has been hijacked by bankers and elitists, bitcoin was never meant to be a store of value. Now people like Luke dash (a core dev) call it a store of value... I’ve tried to get the message to as many people in this sub as possible - I get downvoted and called names and they just ignore solid, verifiable fact. And yes it has been planned, and for a lot longer than we think. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:03
Umm, do you know who funds blockstream.. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:49:40
You do know the tangle has a bug in it called “curl”? That devs over at iota purposefully don’t fix. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:36:54
Congrats man! That’s awesome! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:50:32
You’d have to take a ride down the rabbit hole.. AXA ventures, one of the biggest venture capital firms in the world is one of blockstreams biggest investors -  who is, and who were the CEO’s of AXA? Thomas burburl and Henri de Castries, arguably some of the most powerful people in the world who are key players in the bilderberg group. What is the bilderberg group? they are a group of financial elite; bankers, economists, scholars, politicians, the elite of the elite, The ones who currrently control the system we live in - banks, schooling, news, politics. They are the hidden hands that shape and manipulate our world. Now, that’s just 1 of blockstreams key investors. There is a lot more to blockstream and what’s going on.
Bitcoin won’t save the world. Ever hear of a 1 world currency? Everything in this world is regulated, you honestly think cryptos isn’t/wont be? We live under dictatorships, wether you agree or not. Layers upon layers of control; you cannot drive, get married, renovate your house, buy your house without governments micromanaging your life. You pay income tax along with taxes that come with every purchase you make. We are nothing but slaves. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:29:51
This is the most likely scenario. Be safe and own bch. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:52:56
Interesting.. because I’ve never had that problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:55:37
Haha yeah you did, [here](
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:35:28
The bottom line is - if you’re in cryptos you should already know the facts... do your own research.. make your own decisions. Why would you invest in something you know nothing about? Pc
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:48:44
You said the real one.. bch is the real one. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:48:50
Go through the links in the post. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:39:57
Come on dude, that is literally all you have in defence is to call me a shill? If you cannot defend bitcoin in a reasonable manner, displaying actual facts, no one will take you serious.. clearly I stated verifiable facts. How I get down voted I have no idea.. seems like a lot of butt hurts or shills in this sub to be quite honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:44:09
Uhh.. if you actually go to google trends and type in “bitcoin cash” it’s actually pretty trendy, A lot different than the charts the OP is displaying.... 
Edit; you actually completely edited the trend graph.  Dummy, people aren’t that stupid.

A pastebin won’t make me budge. Guess we’ll wait and see! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:36:57
Lol bch is at 1300, it literally double in market cap in 24 hours and briefly took second place ranking, please tell me why you think it’s a shit coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:46:58
Your choice, but I wouldn’t. Let it drop my man!! Scoop up more and hodl, it’s WILL rise from the ashes like the Phoenix it is! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:47:53
AYO!!! Lucky guy. I stuck with btc because I’ve had bad luck with my FOMO. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:25:59
If you are invested in bitcoin without doing research on it, then I simply feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:44:39
Not feeding them - more like calling them out for making accusation with no basis. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:01:42
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:27:53
Currency difference I would assume..? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:52:20
Since I’ve subbed here I’ve gotten 0 reasonable answers to any of my questions. 0 reasonable debates. 0 facts from supposed bitcoin fanatics. All I get is asshole remarks from 12 yr old circle jerk bandwagon jumpers. 99 percent of people in r/bitcoin hold .001 of a bitcoin and act like they’re millionaires. You don’t have to admit it don’t worry, I know I’m describing you. Unintelligent fucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:07:19
Get over it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:27:38
That’s just a plain ignorant reply, and a lie. Nothing can be proved when you just decide to ignore FACTS.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:40:21
I guess it’s from a moral stand point for me. When I found out who funds bcore, which world leading exchange it’s being adopted into, it proves to me it’s a centralized coin run by our current fiat monetary system controllers. The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. Bitcoin goes against its initial view, which was liberty from the state. It goes against what satoshi wanted. I wish every little holder in btc the best don’t get me wrong. I just hate the oligarchy rule it is now under. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:51:21
Thanks! I’ll look into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:57:04
I’ll hop right onto that random Reddit guy!! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:45:18
Don’t say no one warned you.

@_date: 2017-11-12 04:54:40
Don’t worry my friend, crack a beer and wait it out! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:49:13
Hey man, not a problem. [This]( has a lot of good info and references in it. Only fairly complete post with references I can find atm due to being at work. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:39:56
Look into who funds the devs of bitcore? who funds blockstream? why bitcoin is going onto the worlds largest exchange, CME? Everything is regulated in this world... You think crypto isn’t? Look into AXA. The elites who currently control out fiat monetary system control bitcoin. The truth is out there.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:29:07
Someone needs to get laid. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:25:37
I’ve done a lot of research on btc and bch and I’m going all in on bch. Take it as you will. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:14:17
Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme who’s price is inflated by tether. Be very careful with purchasing btc while this whole fiasco is unfolding. Downvote me all you want, just be careful friends! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:37:55
You’re bashing your own community for wondering about bitcoins fees..? That’s what’s unintelligent. Let me guess, you have .001 of btc and think you’re a millionaire? You should actually try helping people, I mean, that’s what bitcoins initial purpose was in the white pages - Let me guess you haven’t read them and you’re only a bandwagon jumper, thinking you’re going to get rich? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:32:31
Why is it dead? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:45:34
AYO!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:32:38
How is it false? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:29:25
Where does bcc fall into this? It says nothing about it..
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:00:28
That hurt dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:18:01
Don’t let people tell you what to do with your money. Never take advice from the majority here, on this sub -  unintelligent bitcoin circle jerkers. Research cryptos if you are really interested in investing - learn the technical side and research coins; their tech and what they have to offer, if it seems like a good idea to you, make the jump. Don’t ask people what to invest in in crypto land. Never invest money into something you know nothing about!!! That being said I wish you all the best friend! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:52:27
Blockstreams biggest funder - AXA ventures. Who were the last two CEO’s of AXA; current - Thomas buburl, predecessor - Henri de casrties (arguably one of the most powerful men in the world) they both are key members in the Bilderberg. Now that you know this, dig deeper, look up Gavin Anderson and in-Q-tel. This is all public knowledge. Don’t say I’m wrong when you clearly have not looked into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:16:58
Sure bud.. I posted a link complete with references and links.. you’re just ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:05:02
So cash? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:38:08
Is that your defence? Calling someone a shill the instant you don’t agree with them. Boy, you’ve been brainwashed. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:15:17
Wow, good one.. people like you turn people off of this sub and crypto in general.. I thought bitcoin was about helping people and coming together to make the world a better place? Y’all have .001 of a bitcoin and act like your millionaires.. smug, unintelligent assholes. There is too much ego in this sub and lack of reasonable debate or conversation. It’s literally a meme/HODL circle jerk. That being said, I hope you get what you came to this market for, I wish you all the best on your journey. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:44:14
Someone’s scared. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:01:11
Dude I am not trying to argue with you. Stay numb to the truth if you want. There’s a lot more to it. I can tell since you’re trying to attack me you have no useful knowledge on any of this and don’t want it. Pc.
