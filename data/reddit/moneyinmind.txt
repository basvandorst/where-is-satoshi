Thanks for all this info.  I have come to understand there are currently issues with MT GOX from some research I've done, and you've elaborated on this nicely. Thanks!

I wish I had an iPhone.  Thanks for the info, though.  I can come back to this thread once I do get an iPhone.

I took it to mean he/she thought I was going to try to use  charts for trading purposes, and somehow utilize the charts to make profit.  I'm not sure, actually, what he/she meant.
I only am interested in one chart, the one on a site that relays trading information the quickest.

Yes I understand.

Thank you.  I have visited that site and like the setup.
I don't have an exchange.  That's why I posted my request. 
I want to watch BTC/USD in real-time, and I'm looking for the most reliable site to give me accurate data, as recommended by people who know more about bitcoin than I know.

Thank you.  The trading... site is fast!  The other bitcoinwisdom site has many indicators on the chart I'm not yet familiar with, but I like it.
Bitcoin trading seems so risky, I hope you're doing well at it!

Thank you.  I'm not seeing this updating though.  I have to refresh to get it to update.  I'm probably missing something about how this works.

I'm not trying to 'game' the charts.  I have asked for what this community feels is the most reliable for true value live reads.
No hidden agenda, man.
