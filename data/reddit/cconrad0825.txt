Given that mental illness is a serious matter, I would advise you not joke about it. Honestly you attacking me proves you have a weird sense of humor if you wish to involve those who are mentally ill. Please Toke, Depressed, Beavis, or whatever you wish to be called, grow up and move along. You attacking me only shows you have other motives than just telling others about a cool site.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:29:00
Most likely not. Nice try though. Keep adding to the thread though. Both of you are only proving why people shouldn't go there haha
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:02:08
Jokes are usually funny. Keep posting, maybe you'll have a real user account someday
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:10:47
Yes, and you're only proving that you are one haha.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:40:18
It's ok. Most narcissists seek to have the last word in addition to claiming that the other person is mentally ill in lieu of a counter-point. We'll be praying for you Beavis/Depressed/Admin. We know it's not easy having a "community" of only people that agree with you. I'll take this post down if it makes you think that your customer service will win those people you stole from back to your "open discussion" chat room haha.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:06:16
You're points don't support anything other than you attacking me and not looking into the possibility that your "cool group of people" is a scam. I'm not the first to feel this and not the last either. The number of name changes, ownership, lack of revenue stream, etc. all point to this and I did back up my claims with specific examples. 
You instead name call and then blindly talk up the site. You having a user name on the site proves nothing and if anything I wouldn't be surprised if you were part of the admin and just saying you aren't. All people who question the site or it's policies get silenced, muted, or banned and then their deposits are kept. Quite a funny scheme how a leadership team voluntarily runs a site, pays for hosting, and gives coin away yet has so many loyal users who are such till they cross invisible lines. 
Your blanket defense is what you have been doing this entire time. You claiming "I'm not a mod, but ....." only proves that you are trying to preemptively counter any claims that you are a loyalist. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:35:01
Really? Why so? Because I find it hilarious that you suddenly jump into a month old thread with your buddy depressed and attack me personally rather than focus on the issue at hand? Honestly, for someone sensitive to "attacks" on things you have interest in you seem to be the pot calling the kettle black brother.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:48:59
Funny how this 1 month old thread is getting so much attention. I think it's funny how seriously the counter arguements are against me and calling me an asshole. For a site nobody really cares about, there sure is a lot of blanket defense for it.
Nice throw away btw.... lulz
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:56:41
Wow.... nice way to rip off an already established site and strip out the ads lulz.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:15:02
The amount of time you are dedicating to a month old thread is really sad. You should get back to CC where you are treated with respect because obviously I'm such an asshole here. As you said, most people think I'm an asshole. Why then waste your time on this? Seems you have a vested interest.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:37:01
Cool story. I forgot that this isn't the internet and claiming to be something automatically means it's true. Your constant denial and suspicions of me and what I actually documented only prove your whitewashing. 
Also, my "bans" had very much to do with the Inputs.io "hack" which coincidentally occurred right before the site changed ownership to the current admin. Questioning why funds weren't returned only lead to me being muted, not for not being nice or being a "jerk". Might want to actually know more about the site before being an expert on it. Also, funny how you are "occasionally" a user yet have tons of information about me or how you perceive I was there. Might want to back that up before using the goto line of the admin. No other mod had problems with me and in fact since being off the site I've friended many of the other users who were banned or muted profusely. I'm not the only one and your claims about me would be hilarious if you weren't trying so hard to paint me in a bad light
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:10:35
I don't know who either of those other accounts are. You have made a lot of accusations that those are me, yet can't prove jack. Funny how you and Depression_Man though started harping on the same points within minutes of each other though.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:28:23
Did you grow up in a house where if you keep repeating things they eventually make sense? I started this thread with evidence and documentation and you come in and call me names and use hearsay to attack me. I don't know why anyone would ever take your advice. You obviously have too much time on your hands as it is. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:48:42
You resorting to personal attacks only proves your lack of an argument. Please, continue attacking me. It only proves the type of person who is accepted at that joke of a site haha
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:55:28
Cool story. No wonder your depressed, you're an apologist who probably is the admin or one of the loyalists who brushes off any misdoing of the Coinchat "team" haha
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:22:36
Please stop attacking me in lieu of having a real argument. You're only adding to the evidence that you are a shill.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:52:33
Again, this is the internet. Your blanket defense of the site and not letting this go shows you have an interest. Keep whitewashing and maybe it'll prove your point.
Still waiting on the repayment of the funds from the Inputs.io hack. Only when I questioned what happened and asked to contribute to the site as a mod was I ever disciplined or banned so yeah... if you want to talk about coincidences bring it to a PM. I'll be happy to discuss it rather than continuing to waste my time with you justifying their "community" haha
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:31:09
Right, perfect logic. I'd then suggest that you tell the admins of your favorite site to seek help with the police for the money they stole from their users or "lost" since you are all for helping people in need.
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:35:04
Yeah, a martyr complex? Telling someone to "speak American" and being racist isn't being a good mod or owner of a site, it's being a tool. Reporting this isn't being a martyr but warning people about what is to come if they step out of line of what the mod wants to be discussed. I'm sure you're a member of the mod squad as you are sure to take some blame but then "remember" me as a "jerk". Funny how you can call this a whine session. There are a number of people who weren't "jerks" that got banned too. Might want to check your blind loyalty and name calling before you claim that I have no claim to complain.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:47:12
You realize I was talking about you? You feeling that you are well only proves your narcissism is worse than expected. Figures you'd think you are one to give advice. Your posts only fuel the flames. Please sign off and examine what you are writing. You're only making my earlier points of lockstep loyalty and blind white washing even more valid. Thanks for bringing this thread back. It would have disappeared if not for your denial of what is being shown clearly as fact.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:21:25
BS? Might want to reread the post if you think admins stealing user funds and banning those who ask about it is BS. If you are so well in the community, let's see how they take you asking about Inputs.io and right after TF handing the site over to the current management.

Dash, BTC, and many other cryptos are widely accepted in the chaos and used to freely transfer funds in Latin America, especially in Venezuela.

It's illegal to use the "people's" electricity for this. Mining Bitcoin comes with a 18 month prison sentence. There are operations to mine there but it's very risky in this state of chaos. Even running a non-crypto business is risky.

Thanks Señor Condescending. I'll be mining and earning coins rather than dealing with your quiz. So much for asking a question.

Back to my original point: Downvotes do not equate right and wrong. It's pointless as is this back and forth.

Nobody's fooled into anything. It's not spam, but a referal for a service like anyone here does for a service they use and like. Funny, you seem to be a voluntarist but have an issue with someone recommending a service they like for others to try.

I do concede that, the delivery could use some work. I am however sticking with it and hopefully by the time our project is ready to go we can order supplies for construction and upkeep with it. Definitely looking forward to the merger of the BTC and 3D printing world, as a lot of smaller components of the farm will be made through those
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:29:23
I am pleasantly surprised about the gold dropping. I was called a fool for not jumping on that band wagon, which I wish I did in 2004-2006 when it was half the price it is now. 
However, I am happy btc is now stable. I raise funds for my farm project in both traditional and BTC currency, and maybe the drop in BTC has helped because we got our first 0.5 BTC donation today. Whoever it was is awesome!

I agree, but it's consumer choice. They probably go with BTC guild because it's better.

If I already have the machine... and I was going to be using the computer the expense is neglectible at best. Also, you cannot calculate a loss or gain until you actually sell the commodity, which allows you to realize it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:32:41
But that bubble high was highly overvalued, based in companies that didn't even have a product. A digital currency taken down by trading lags caused by DDoS attacks are completely different. This wasn't a bubble because of lack of demand, but sabotage. Also, the NASDAQ being lower than that bubble has led to companies being leaner, more innovative, and more sustainable economically... I don't see why that is bad.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:50:35
You never lose anything till you sell it it is delisted. In total agreement, just want to clarify that point of a realized gain or loss.

Which brings up a good point of how opponents say that more bitcoins will be created to dillute the system and it will crash like any other fiat currency, which isn't true. Bitcoins are neither created nor destroyed, they are mined and/or broken into smaller units.

No, I find him quite humorous, in a throwing out anything that sticks to the conspiracy theorist, constitutitonalist wall. He claims to hate the state but still loves the Constitution/Bill of Rights. Basically it's the state is good if it agrees with me, which he claims it doesn't to keep the sham going, but never will call for outright anarchist-capitalism because that'd alientate his Tea Party demographic.
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:28:58
No, the rate required to pay out to you is low, so you don't have to work as hard to get what you earn. For example: Instead of requiring a balance of 0.1 BTC, Coinmidas allows withdrawals at 0.0020. Not spamming, but nice language bud. 
Obviously, Eric578 didn't want people to see he said that him not understanding my title, which is accurate to the service provided by Coin of Midas, means that it's "of the same quality as the shitty site"
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:01:11
Damn, I'm going to cry now because my post didn't satisfy the hivemind. Again, I refer to the definition of spam. You continue to use the word yet have no concept of what it means. In the meantime you continue to comment on this post you claim to hate. Spending a lot of time on something that doesn't mean anything to you. Seems pretty authoritarian of a behavior if you ask me. I don't agree with you yet you continue to insist you are right, I'm wrong. Next you'll pull out "I'm rubber, you're glue." Seriously, your interest in continuing to justify your flawed logic is both humorous and sad.

The author has also been on a warpath against BTC. I'm not whining, but he's pretty biased and it's sad he's being considered a journalist and not a commentator.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:36:22
I'd have to say that it wasn't so much greed that caused the crash, that is natural speculation. The DDoS, stopping the freefall trading, and other market manipulations are what I think made it worse. It's still higher than it was in January, and I don't have skin in the game by buying coins, but through earning them, I am still in the black. The only people who "lost" money, if they sold the coins in the past few days, are those who sold for less than they bought in for. If you are shakey after a few months because of a drop in a price of a commodity, you should keep your money buried in the back yard.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:21:27
Why not try? If they are superior product, then ignoring them to artificially balance the market would make us just as bad as a centralized currency. The choice of the miner is what matters and if BTC guild is better than it's not their fault that the others suck. Neither should it be that those who do mine with BTC have an unfair advantage because the rest of us put principle over profit.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:54:13


The same logic goes for what you claim is right, but everyone on reddit knows that not to be true. This also is my post so you are the one who cannot move on.

That's an incredibly small sample, yes they are the majority source of pools, but it's consumer choice. Tell other pools to be better and people will go there.

Yup, I'm an asshole because I've accused someone who's recommending a service to get free bitcoins and berated another user for hours over a post I could just brush by and ignore... oh wait that's not me.. that's you. My mistake. I thought the whole point of this community was to promote the usage and distribution of BTC. Spamming would be "[to] send unsolicited bulk messages, especially advertising, indiscriminately." I made 1 post and it's not bulk. So please, continue to educate me on how posting a referal link to promote a service I use and enjoy is spam and by defending such a post to someone who's been engaging in personal insults and childish arguments is being an asshole?
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:41:57
You can do all of that on LinkedIn. A lot cheaper.

Thanks, I am running the same, but that might work. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:53:30
So tell the other pools to step their game up. The entire reason we chose to persue this currency is because the other sucked, not because someone made us or told us to do it so the dollar doesn't domiante, but because it's better.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:24:47
Am I the only person who doesn't keep their funds on anything but their wallet? I thought that was the whole point of BTC and other currencies. I've traded through exchanges, but why someone would leave their money in an Mt.gox account with all the risks of ddos and hacks is beyond me.

The goal is to have not only the farm but a system of employment that will allow graduates of our joint program with the [SENA Training System]( to help with the building of the next farm, in other areas outside of the metropolitan areas where it's hard to find well paying work and fresh, affordable, organic sources of food. Once it is approved I'll list the project here. Our website for our project is

I love how he says it's a fiat currency with no base and is shooting up only to collapse.. which gold in my opinion the same case could be made. the difference between gold and btc is there is a finite amount of them which prevents a Federal Reserve type of situation. Anything that is a currency is only as valuable as the demand for it is strong. Banana's, copper, anything can be currency and a holder of wealth. The beauty of BTC is the security, ease of transaction, and the total lack of regulation. It should be a free marketist's wet dream.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:38:12
It doesn't stop them from doing so, however, people are complaining about the drop. Mt. Gox should stay true and only stop if it's a security risk. Much of the selloff was because of the slack in the system with the maintenance and then the ddos attack. No notice was given of this maintenance and yes you can trade elsewhere, but if your preset trades are not being placed then the market is being manipulated beyond your control.

It's not a failed spam post. It's a referal. You don't know what spam means. Nobody's butthurt, you're the one going on for hours debating with me over something that actually helps the community. You also are pretty authoritarian for someone who claims to be anarchist. Move along, people who can discuss something without resorting to personal insults are trying to talk. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:15:05
Yup, I post to reddit to win debates. That's my goal. You seem to be the one who's butthurt. You keep commenting on this "shitty" post which I'm sure a lot of the people who downvoted it because it's not about Mt.Gox or charts still are using the link to get free btc without mining. My referal rate has proven that. Therefore, yes, I have won. I've gained more than you have from this "shitty" post because contrary to your belief, upvotes don't pay bills but btc do.

I am using BTC to fund a aquaponics farming operation, and will have a miner running on site to keep up funds while we are growing. We're in Colombia where electricity is really expensive, so I was wondering how much was the solar array to power the miner, and do you support other devices as well with the output?

It's the same project. I have two wallets, one through this site, and the other at address 1AMq2cuVpkfPUgkzZoVKQjXTveKUr2fXQc. Someone who went to my site directly donated 0.5 BTC.

It's Bloomberg, but if you read the rest of the articles by the same author, he's had a hardon for trashing bitcoin. I'm sure he has no financial interest in any alternatives and trashing it gives him no gain.
