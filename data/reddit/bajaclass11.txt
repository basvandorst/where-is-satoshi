I like that not everyone knows which way is correct.  It serves as a modern day shiboleth, and/or argot that tells me if the speaker is "in the know".

Good luck!   Unfortunately, Austin isn't so "weird" when it comes to bitcoin.  At least in the r/austin sub-reddit, they were very close-minded the last time I've seen it mentioned.

If you're using an OS that requires an antivirus, you're doing it wrong.  Sorry, but I'm starting to doubt your 10 years of IT administration claim.
