Say what you will, but I'm glad the polls show an all time high.  As someone heavily involved in cryptocurrency I hope it goes higher this year, or next year, or whenever.  It's all just a question of when....

I don't have anything bitcoin related to say. I just really wanted to thank you for Wikipedia.  
I can't tell you how many hours I have spent in a wikihole....it starts out with a simple question, what was that one guy in that one movie?
Two hours later I'm reading about the poison from an amazonian tree frog....39 links removed from the original question and Wikipedia entry...
I truly believe that knowledge is power, and I just wanted to thank you for helping to spread the power.

I get it, we're all whiner babies.  Let's go play somewhere else.  
I've heard it.  I don't care.
I found this petition someone made a while back,
take a few minutes and sign it.  Fuck everyone else or what they say, take a moment and add a little towards change.
if you're going to reply and say why bother or this is useless or waste of time, guess what? i don't care.  save your wit for gym class.
