I'm getting an error trying to run lightning-app. Can anyone help? Error says:
Uncaught Exception, failed to load gRPC binary module b/c it's not at the expected directory of Electron-v1.4-win32-x64-unknown.
I'm installing this on my d: drive, is it checking for something on my c: drive? I don't see which electron directory it's looking for...

Cool thanks. I can read and understand most of what's going on there too...

I just started learning Python recently. Can you answer me this: What part of this is coded in Python? It looks like everything I see is JS on the github.

So you're against testing a beta app? I'm confused...

That's what I was hoping, but that's a very significant increase. Healthy response I'd say.

Ya, someone posted your data above. Would be cool to see the time series. 
As far as the Coin Dance data, they heavily filter out any multiple nodes that the same party runs. I can't decide if that's helpful or not though there's obviously some level of centralization involved with a user running many nodes. Also, "In addition to this, Coin Dance also ignores non-listening nodes which have a maximum of only eight outbound peers."

So when the BIP102 hard forks in November what happens? Who actually forks off? Core .15 nodes continue to run the core software, so hopefully miners follow the profitable chain. Is that close?

What is the implication of non duplicate listening?

They 12-word backup can generate private keys for many addresses, but it isn't the private key itself.

I've also wondered this. At what point is this not a full node?

Isn't there a problem that if you buy from the fiat gateways like Coinbase they aren't telling you that you are buying on the 2x chain?

So do SPV wallets like Electrum, which I use, get to point to only nodes I trust? Is there any way to make my SPV wallet more secure?
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:38:50
Is this de wey
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:22:43
Right, but I meant, BIP102 is in the Core .15 client and forks off at the designated block height. but then Core .15 doesn't use that fork?

How could 2x win without the 9000+ nodes? I guess I need to review how the hard fork works again. I believe that Segwit included BIP102, which will hard fork around Nov 18? Is that right? What happens at that point?

any way to make an SPV wallet more secure? (I use Electrum)
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:10:43
That makes so much more sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:22:07
bandwidth is also the restriction though right? and not under Moore's law
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:42:11
why 3 nodes?
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:45:37
How would you define elite?
