I think as former chairman of the federal reserve, America's central bank, its safe to say a great many people associate him with prolonging irresponsible economic practices, playing favorites, and otherwise defiling what should be a free market. Doing so through an unelected board of ..political economists is just the icing on the cake. The position is congress and wall street's hired bookie and counterfeiter essentially. The morality / constitutionality of all that is fully open to challenge, as well as its economic merits. 
However; I never said that he doesn't have relevant knowledge. What I was saying is that him commenting on economic policy, especially the future of cryptocurrency, is the equivalent of a rapist commenting on prevention of sexual assault. I'd just rather he not.

North Carolina State and The University of Central Florida. Universities that have qualified to play football (American, not soccer) in this specific bowl game at the end of the season. 
A bowl is like a championship, except since there are so many schools (well over 100), there are many bowl games. Its a long running tradition, and some are more prestigious than others. Also, the sponsor titles of the games can change. Like this year its Bitcoin.

The funny thing is, there's nothing barring you from becoming knowledgeable and involved in bitcoin except for yourself.

Forcimg a charge on someone for something they don't even have to actually do themselves is a bit like stealing.
 Throw around the phrase 'may' be required to pay a service charge in 'some' cases, which is a bit like fraud.
Not quite, but almost.
