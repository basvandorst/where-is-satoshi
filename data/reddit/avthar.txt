Sure. I understand. Not too sure how to attach a screenshot to this conversation, but I have proof right here that I would gladly share.

Exactly my point! You can imagine how worried I am now. As numerous users have my information. They have copied a bunch of people on MY SUPPORT TICKET. And now everybody they have copied, has my personal informatio

Hi Guys.
Akhil has given me a call. And has apologised for the mistake and assured me that he has contacted the individual who has my documents and will make sure my identity and accounts are safe

Thanks. Will try that link now

As I stated in my previous reply: This information was copied on the email that support replied to me, and copying other individuals. So now, other users have my personal information
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:17:28
Nope. Other CEX users that have opened up different tickets.
Essentially, I opened up a ticket for MY PROBLEM. CEX then asked for my ID docs etc. Which I provided. Then, they copied other users that were experiencing issues, on my support ticket. All this while, all my personal information, which i was asked to provide, was still attached to the email for other users to see

Yes! Thats exactly what happened. I even have the thread to prove it. Also, one of the users reply to the email thread was
"I don't know bro who you are. I have my problem with cex.io and I received reply from them and when I checked email I was joined to someone conversation. I don't know this information is private or no but I see someone ****** from*****and bank statement with following details 
bank ******
CARD NUMBER ***********
I am sure that this information won't solve my problem. 
I am not going to share this information to someone if this is cex.io error. be sure that I won't share this information to someone else"

So- I had an issue with cex. I opened up a ticket with support. Support did reply to me, however, copied other users on my ticket. Support attached my ID documents, and Bank statements (With credit card details) to this reply, with all these other users on the email thread. One user even replied, telling me he now has my credit card and id documents on hand.
