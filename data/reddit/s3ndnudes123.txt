10% of whatever you lost... its a cruel joke by nicehash.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:19:05
"fully" apparently means 10% according to nicehash...
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:06:06
If you look around on this sub there are ways to fix that problem. I don't know the exact details so I wont try to explain but its possible to fix it. Hopefully someone more informed can explain it to you. But until then do a search on this sub and you should be able to find the answer.

It's over 10,000bcash ready to be dumped already. Fucking insane! Price is going to drop so fast...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:58
Probably coinbase shitting themselves trying to figure out how to cover all the sell orders of bcash... lol.  
EDIT: "Sends and receives are available immediately. Buys and sells will be available to all customers once there is sufficient liquidity on GDAX. We anticipate that this will take a few hours."  
That basically says it all. They don't have enough liquidity to cover the costs of everyone selling bcash. That's from their twitter apparently.

Ah nice thanks, last i heard they just said a few hours. Good to know a specific time now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:26

@_date: 2019-11-05 04:27:37
Ah gotcha, thanks for clearing that up!
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:08:09
oh i meant to ask, is there any way to estimate profits per day?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:51:36
Ya... until the difficulty of bitcoin cash adjust's tomorrow (which will make mining BTC more profitable again) it's not going to get any better. Hopefully all of those transactions aren't people selling everything out of fear. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:23:54
How do you plan to reward supporters?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:58:51
  
Hopefully the bulk of transactions will start processing tomorrow once the difficulty of BCH adjusts and brings back the miners to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:23:45
you wont see it on coinbase until sometime in January supposedly
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:22:18

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:02:22
Which is what? Also just noticed that Bithumb is eithe offline or stopped what they were doing? Wuhapened
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:35:27
from what i have been reading its spam to congest the BTC network so it grinds to a halt and bitcoincash takes over. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:27:35
Thanks, I think it should be roughly close to that power so that helps a ton.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:27:22

@_date: 2017-11-12 19:39:55
Good to hear that things are finally moving a long
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:56:46

Get "uBlock origin" instead of adblock.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:27:41
You do realize its the internet and you are allowed to say fuck. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:03:17
Get "uBlock origin" instead of adblock, it's a lot more effective. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:15:00
they announced they would add it in about a month, then released it 2 days later without any warning. It was even on their road map and they released it early with no warning.
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:39:06
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:46:39
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:16:29
lol... they stated it would be a month and even had that noted in the road map that they told everyone about. Then said fuckit and added it 2 days later with no warning.

steam already accepts bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:18:11
How about the people that bought bcash at $8000+ before they closed trading? And then when trading was resumed the price was already down to $3000?
