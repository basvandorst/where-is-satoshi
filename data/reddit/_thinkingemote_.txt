Hey I was wondering if its possible and viable for you to take my $12.8 in btc wallet and transfer me $10 on paypal, that would greatly help me. No hard feelings if you say no

How do I cash out via paypal. I only have $10. Was paid via btc. I set up a coinbase account and got money there and now I'm unable to add paypal cause paypal option is not showing. Its only showing bank options. Can someone please help

Btw what will be the best mining software if I want to mine using my gtx 1060. I have little to no mining knowledge. Pretty sure 1060 will be able to generate a bit of cash for my pc.

Nope. I got paid via btc recently and am stuck with it. Can't add paypal account on coinbase cause I'm not from USA
