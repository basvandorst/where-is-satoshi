Why even bother commenting?

Is there an android app?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:58:04
How do I do that? Can I have a shared wallet on my PC and phone? Should I invest in a ledger?

I don't actually own anything yet, I'm just starting and want to make sure I can do whatever I want once I get going. Thanks!

Okay but how do I buy and go about selling those local coins?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:13:02
Yeah I think I should be fine. I do that really know what in doing yet so I'm going to hodl (know what that means now lmao) and see what happens and maybe one day started day trading, but it's hard in Canada

Are you based in Canada? I only have the option to add a credit card which I can only use to buy, not sell crypto.

Also, should I just get rid on Coinbase then?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:07:47
Can I use Bitfinex exclusively? I'd rather keep it all on one platform instead of transferring everything around to different services

What would you consider a small balance? I don't have a ton to play around with (wanna start with ~$50 to learn what I'm doing for now). I'm a student and can't dump $20,000 into cryptos like a lot of people on here seem to be doing.
