Retailers can tell when they have straw buyers coming in.

So someone wanted to create a dip and buy in it.

Which largely would do nothing to the miners gobbling nearly every single dedicated chip.  
Would be amusing to see the AI/ML side of these GPUs help smack some sense back into graphics card prices.

No, $1400 for a 1080ti isn't a "should pay" level, unless they're buying two.

Also:  
Lost sales down the road and damage to their brand.

Moving more units is good, but not pissing off your target market is better.  
This is where market segmentation is a good thing.

Make some cut-rate Titan V's for the miners, and then go all out on anything on other cards.

Not when it's been affecting nearly every card for a sustained rate.  The sooner that the mining is confined to dedicated hardware, the better.

The GPU markets have done the opposite.  
When there's some pain being felt by miners (and not gamers), then you might have a point.  
A waitlist for base MSRP would work wonders.

Which would attract undue attention their way, as the market for new cards would dry up.

Or an even worse zonk.

I'm not so sure that would work, since bitcoin has been seized before.

I'd imagine they'd have done the same with the monarch.

If they sense a existential threat, they'll have a "perfect time".

Not all are as welcoming of the precariat as you might be.
