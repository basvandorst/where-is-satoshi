I’m planning to cash out maybe a quarter or a third of my stash after the new year sometime so I can stay in my current tax bracket for 2017. I think when this current bubble pops it will be the most despair we’ve ever seen. I do think we have a ways to go until it pops though. Price could easily double or triple from here still.

Try back in a few minutes, sometimes they get resupplied quickly. Remember they aren't an exchange, they buy and sell bitcoins themselves.

This might be a dumb question but would it have been possible for Satoshi to write the bitcoin code such that no mining pool could attain 51%? Basically put a cap of 50% for all mining pools? Or is that not possible? 
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:21:28
I was watching it too, it was pretty funny actually. It actually makes a good point that it is (at least for me still) kind of tough sometimes to put bitcoin into laymans terms for other people who don't know what it is.

why not use a trezor? that's what I plan to order soon.
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:56:07
Trezor is still 10X better than say, the coinbase vault right? because you own the private keys. I just got my trezor a few weeks ago to get my coins off of coinbase. I don't want to keep switching from one technology to the other because a little thing is found that MIGHT be of a security concern. How big a deal is the bootloader? I have no idea what that is anyways.

Yea it's definitely tempting to buy more because "omg what if it skyrockets I'm gonna wish I bought more!" I'm sure I'll buy some more small amounts in the future.

What does the consistency of the paper feel like? Is it like receipt paper out of a cash register or is it more robust? They claim a 20 year life on the image that gets printed (I know it's not ink, its a "heat" type of printing) so I like that since I'm going to use it mainly for long term storage wallets.

Ugh wtf, so it's saying if I buy right now I get my coins at the market price of whatever it is on Friday? Not happy right now. Edit: anybody know how long it will be this way? They've exceeded their buy limits for today, so at midnight do those "limits" reset? or are they literally out of coins to sell?
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:51:32
We will probably find out on Monday. Unless it is leaked over the weekend. There may be multiple winning bids since there were multiple blocks of 3000 bitcoins auctioned that each had to be bid on separately.
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:58:06
I haven't had any problems with coinbase. I got into bitcoin just after the new year and I've been buying in small increments anytime the price has dropped. I'm holding onto my coins for a while/long term and I'm just gonna see where it takes me.

few weeks ago I remember seeing a similar thing and it was putting people with around 1 btc in the 1%. Which is more accurate?
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:06:01
I think it's more that they don't want to announce who the winner is if the winner doesn't want to be known. If the winner doesn't mind being known, then he can gladly announce he won. If I just acquired tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin I would not want my name advertised.

@_date: 2014-07-20 20:52:21
I see your point, but you can't do anything with the private key unless you know the passphrase. I suppose I could take the time to make the cd myself instead of purchasing it, but as far as the actual thing my coins are stored on, I want something more durable than paper. BIP38 encryption is nearly impossible to crack if your passphrase is good enough.
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:07:28
Well, in that case, I guess I'll have to either buy, sell or hold depending on the price movement. That's my plan.

For sure it's possible. But at the moment it's all about bitcoin, and I'm just buying and holding mostly because I don't want to get into day trading. The question was are you panic selling, my answer no. Then why? Because I'm holding them for the long term and I want to see where bitcoin goes. Little crashes like this because one exchange is falling apart doesn't get to me much at all.
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:26:33

@_date: 2014-06-27 14:51:30
I agree. I probably wouldn't even put that much. Maybe 50 to 60 grand. I think bitcoin has HUGE potential but it's volatile and who knows what will happen to it 6,7 years from now.

@_date: 2014-06-27 22:53:13
Funny you say that, because micro bitcoin is also used sometimes. And with the micro symbol too- looks like a u. I think it will work itself out. I think bits will be used in day to day transactions at stores or online, and the full bitcoin will be used when talking about the markets and buying or selling bitcoin on exchanges. At least that's what I think.
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:47:54
Why? Because if you own some bitcoin, then you want it to go up in value....pretty simple. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:10:55
If you had said you will eat a hat if it doesn't happen I surely would have had to buy some more coins. It would have been a win-win situation. Either i make money or I get to watch someone eat a hat again.

I don't see any problem with upvoting it. Maybe some others who are curious about bitcoin come to this subreddit, see a post like this and they get more interested in bitcoin and see that the community here is open and accepting to newcomers. It helps to push bitcoin more mainstream IMO. If this was r/bitcoinmarkets I would agree with you that there's no point upvote something like this in a more technical-oriented community.
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:55:43
I like how Andreas Antonopolis put it on the Joe Rogan podcast last night- food, drugs, and sex are the three biggest commodities in humans history, and if bitcoin couldn't buy those things, he'd be much less confident in it since it basically wouldn't qualify as a currency. - no where near his exact quote, but you get the gist.

First of all thank you very much for your time. I know a lot of people including myself are "buy and hold" people just buying bitcoin here and there from the comfort of our own home. Just to clarify, nothing needs to be filled out until we "cash out" or sell our bitcoins, correct? Edit: follow up Q: I have bought at many different values over the course of the last 3 months or so, say I cash out all my bitcoin a couple years from now and the value of bitcoin has gone up to say 2000 dollars, can I use whatever the "average value" of all my coins are? or do I have to somehow account for each coin, or fraction of coins I purchased? (isn't that impossible since you just have a grand total of bitcoins owned?)

The company that makes the game (Blizzard) makes them. I actually originally got it back when I played WoW because my account got hacked once. Each authenticator has it's own ID number on the back that you use to register it with your account. I think if you lose it, you have to contact Blizzard support and they probably just ask you a series of security-type questions to verify that you are who you say you are, then they probably just disable that particular authenticator. I was thinking just on the basis of theft, a thief is much more likely to swipe a cell phone as opposed to a simple little thing with a button on it. Also, I'm not exactly sure how the number generation on it works- whether it generates a random number when you press it, and sends that number to the game somehow, or if it retrieves a number from some signal. Maybe someone familar with authenticators might be able to answer that. But yea I had to pay something for the authenticator, I forget how much, maybe like 15 bucks.

I don't own enough bitcoin that I would open up something like a safety deposit box but I still want to keep it nice and safe. I have my bitcoin on coinbase at the moment. What do people do with paper wallets? print it out, lamenate it? stick it in a folder somewhere and put it in your underwear drawer?

I think some simple TA can be useful like support and resistance, and general trend lines. It had pretty much been predicted that some kind of big movement would occur around this time because the long term trend lines were converging right about now.

Yea 1 bit is a millionth of a bitcoin. Some people are trying to get others to refer to bitcoin in bits since it's easier to think in terms of whole numbers instead of thinking " hmm I need .005 bitcoins to buy a coffee" then there's the Satoshi- 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin.

It sounds like you create a private key from a random passphrase you come up with : "Cryo Card was also engineered to withstand the ultimate enemy of crypto-currency storage – trust. Utilizing offline AES-256 encryption*, your newly generated or existing Private Key can never be known to us or any other entity that does not know your personally chosen passphrase. The encryption process is performed in your own browser – not on our servers – so your passphrase is never seen by us. You can even disconnect your device from the Internet while generating and encrypting a new encrypted Private Key (or encrypting an existing one) and re-connect to complete your order. This can help to ensure that your Private Key and chosen passphrase are not potentially compromised. We also accept previously encrypted Private Keys for new orders. However, we will not accept unencrypted Keys for any Cryo Card order." But that part I don't fully understand. I guess it's kind of like a brain wallet private key?

It's safer in the sense that is someone were to somehow get access to your coinbase account, this makes it much harder for them to actually move the coins out of your account because there are more layers they have to get through (multiple verification emails, co-signers, 48 hour wait and phone call to you to verify you are withdrawing. In that sense it's safer but what most people don't like about it is that you don't control the keys yourself. It comes down to how comfortable you are with letting coinbase hold your coins. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:21:06
I agree. It would be nice to be able to check every now and then on the blockchain and not just viewing your balance on coinbase.

Curious where you "went" to buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:29:09
One piece of advice that I have learned since getting into bitcoin back in January: NOBODY I repeat NOBODY knows what the price of bitcoin will do, especially short term. Technical analysis is nice, I don't think it should be disregarded by any means, but take it with a grain of salt.id recommend buying through coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:07:05
I don't think this scam could be more obvious
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:20:34
What exactly do you mean to "check the software"? Shouldn't it be safe if it passed those "dieharder" tests?
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:13:49
Bits is also a smaller denomination of bitcoin. I thought you were referring to that.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:35:13

1k? I'd hold.
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:36:23
Is what I said false though? Regardless of whatever the point of bitcoin is, if you own bitcoin, then you want it's value to go up. I don't buy bitcoin thinking "oh man I really hope the price of bitcoin stays exactly here so it stabilizes" bitcoin is so volatile and unpredictable, what's the problem with simply trying to make some money off of it?
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:39:48

Another nugget of information I might add is that the US Marshals in 1 email to a bidder accidently hit "reply all" and then the bidders were able to see each other's emails. I believe other bidders got in after this screw up so it was probably a partial list (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

I'm interested about coinbase security as well. I recently activated the instant pay method by verifying a credit card.

@_date: 2015-05-04 18:05:08
Well technically they still exist but they're just sitting in a wallet unable to be used so for all intents and purposes they are "destroyed" but I would hope anyone with a wallet that has a significant amount of bitcoin would keep the private key secured. It's anyone's guess as to how many bitcoins have been "lost". I don't know if it's a flaw per se, it just makes the remaining bitcoins more valuable.

It's basically like a stock that tracks the price of a commodity. Like there is a gold ETF which fluctuates with the price of gold. The bitcoin ETF would have moved with the price of bitcoin.

I have a sizeable holding from when I bought mostly in 2014/15.(I have taken profits along the way and have made ~3X back what I put in) I’m holding because I still believe bitcoin has another big run in it within the next few years, however I’ve been growing more and more skeptical that bitcoin will ever truely be mass adopted.
