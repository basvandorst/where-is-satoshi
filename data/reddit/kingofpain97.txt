It’s still early with how new crypto is.  Different coins are implementing different methods on what they think will be what succeeds.

Different than me, as soon as I came in a coworker looked at me and said, “so how’s your bitcoin doing today!?”  I just responded with, “pretty good, it’s on sale!”
We have a $100 bet going, he thinks on 12/8/18 (a year from when we made the bet) that bitcoin will be under $1600.  I differ.

It's only one crappy day, when people sell, that's when I get greedy :o)

Yeah that would be the way to do it lol.  I figured we could keep it in terms that they understand ��. I have “converted” two of my other coworkers into buying in, so it’s not a lost cause or anything.

I know, I could ask him if he wants to do more.  We both have signed copies of the bets in our walllets, and I’ve bet him before on stuff so I know he will pay, as he knows I will as well.

You are wrong about this.  There are plenty of people who are selling.  You can buy them from exchanges without a problem, and there are websites who accept it as a form of payment.

Yep give them the info, and tell them to only put money in they can afford to lose.  You don’t want to tell them to get there hopes up in case of a crash.
