Black Sheep in Provo took them during the bitmob, but not sure if they're still doing it.

I live in Provo, Utah and when ordering pizza last night, I asked about bitcoin, as places in town already take it. The guy on the phone got his manager who in turn had never heard of it. I spelled it out for her and told her to tell the owner to Google it and to start accepting it because its 100% easier than giving my credit card info over the phone and their drivers would do well to start receiving their tips in bitcoin vs fiat. She seemed confused but definitely interested. Everyone, keep asking everyone to accept it and, if they don't know what it is, help them out,

This is awesome and seems to be stable thus far. Part of me would love to see additional exchanges added, though I can see why others might only want bitstamp. Regardless, thanks so much for making this. Very cool.

It'll blossom in unforeseeable ways. In 1995, the 'internet' existed, though who would have guess Twitter would have ever been possible, let alone aid in the uprising of citizens against their governments. 
My hope and faith is secured in BTC in the same fashion. Not to 'get rich' or 'wealthy', which is a byproduct of a 'good thing'. It's more the idea of having a paradigm shift in junction with the use of something new, specifically an advancement like the 'internet' or crypto-life. 
If we get 'rich', sweet. If not, at least we all participated in trying something different that could (hopefully) change the world in the most peaceful of ways.
