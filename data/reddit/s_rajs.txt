 Many of your top competitors have already implemented both Segwit and transaction batching which benefit users and network as a whole; also paves way for exciting tech like Lightning Network. Gemini should embrace new Bitcoin tech if it wants to be a leader in the space. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:14:56

 Bitcoin as a bridge requires two conversions: fiat1\-\&gt;Bitcoin, Bitcoin\-\&gt;fiat2, so it isn't direct, unless I misunderstand what you are trying to say. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:43:49
Difficult to tell all the things in public. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:48:42
I was excited they were developing miners.
@_date: 2018-05-19 05:04:46
Everyone has it's on opinion and Everyone think differently.

@_date: 2018-05-19 04:35:17
Bank always on fire.
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:59:50

 If you can pay with fractions of a bitcoin then, in fact, the supply of bitcoins is limitless. Because one can subdivide a bitcoin to infinity and hence there is no upper limit to the number of parts of a bitcoin available. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:41:20
 16\-17 million is not small amount.
