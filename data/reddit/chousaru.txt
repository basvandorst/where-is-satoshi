You sir are just unhappy you can't play for free. Ignore what this guy says btw, he started saying that Spoutcraft is a virus client and that paying $5 to have fun on a server is a scam, and that you shouldn't have to pay to play to have fun. If it was free then the server would go broke very quickly. There is just no pleasing some people I'm afraid. 
The server is really fun and really well designed. I've been playing for a few days the Admin and Mod's log on regularly and are very helpful with any problems that may arise. They are also open to suggestions for the server providing they aren't crazy game breaking ideas.
So yeh don't be afraid to have to pay to play on this server. If you decide to give it ago and for some unknown reason you don't get on its only $5 its not going to break the bank is it?

Where did you get the idea that I'm unhappy to pay to play? I've spent Thousands of £ (yes £ not $) on free to play games over the years. I pay to have fun. Why be a freeloader when you can support the games and servers you enjoy? Besides so far I have made the back 0.02 BTC it cost me to join the server in just a few days. I plan on using it as just an in-game currency to trade with not too interested in using the server to make money.
As for latency as far as I'm aware the server is in Florida, I'm just outside London and I have very little latency in game.
