Lets hope that stance remains, but this is one further reinforcement of that fact, which is good news either way you look at it.  It's legal *for now*.

inb4 credit card shipping fraud.  If you're forwarding packages and don't have documentation showing you "know your customer" then you could very well be held liable for your customers purchases.  Also a very common theme for credit card fraud is to ship something bought with a stolen card to a "collection" point and then have those marks re-ship it to you, often out-of-jurisdiction.   Don't be that mark.

If there is something to be done about Gox, legally, it will lie in a class action and they'll have to hold the judgement over every one of their heads for the rest of their lives to collect on it.

Only an idiot would take their $USD, convert it to BTC, then convert it back to buy, if you could just buy it with $USD.
What this does is allow people to easily buy products with their BTC for 0.75% fee (The same fee as trading it to $USD and buying something - everything is still priced in the original currency, $USD for example).
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:48:33

Something to mention that a lot of people don't seem to understand about rapid growth... Planning to 2-3x capacity COSTS 2-3x more.  Planning to 10x capacity without previous knowledge that you'd need it (since you have to order servers weeks in advance) is as possible as predicting the future.

"Wall street" throws millions of dollars at the problem.  They have million dollar mainframes running specialized o/s and high speed interconnects so they can run trades in memory across several machines at low latency.  I don't think gox is at this scale yet.  
The underlying problem is that a single exchange dictating prices is a bad match for bitcoin.  Even if Gox had a proper trading engine, it would still be dangerous to have them represent the majority of trades and being the trend setter for pricing.  
I watched the LIVE exchanges react to mtgox's 1hr delayed prices which is just nutty.  So even if they only represented 80% of the exchange traffic, they influence the other 20% anyway so its a mock distribution.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:39:10
Ah, you meant it in a positive light for them such as spending tracking of users based on blockchain analysis, yes definitely, if you use the same wallet.

The exchanges are only a small portion of transfers,  but they are harder to "fake"  because  they cost significant percentages to do so there is less  artificial trades.

Look at the price of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:17:06
It's most likely that the "buy with paypal get free btc" is effectively selling BTC in their legal view (you buy with paypal and get btc, so even if it's 10% thats significant).  Since OP doesn't have an "exchange/trading" account with Paypal they had to cut it.  There are other accounts (bitinstant) that can trade btc for paypal because they have a grandfathered "virtual currency" paypal account which allows them to do this, remnant from second-life and all that stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:42:42
Or simply only allow amazon prime members to buy (two-fold benefit of driving new prime members into amazon).
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:36:40
In my dealings with Paypal they are on the conservative side of their business decisions, I've seen good merchants that had been running for years get terminated because they suddenly got 2 disputes in 1 month.  It depends on who looks at the case and is extremely subjective.   There are no "appeals" short of filing a lawsuit against paypal.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:38:55
The biggest issues to tackle right now are the following, in my mind:
* Mining pools need to decentralize, if any shared pool (btcguild right now for example) has more than 50% of the hashrate this is dangerous as they could poison the chain and really mess things up for everyone.
* A second, large, trusted exchange (amazon, i'm looking at you).  Depending on mtgox or ANY exchange to be the "main" one, defeats the purpose of having a decentralized currency and from what we've seen in the last week, a major threat to the stability of coins.  
* A widespread acceptance of bitcoins among merchants (again, amazon, I'm looking at you).
* Education.  This ties into the first 3 issues quite substantially, the more people understand about bitcoin the sooner we can get over many of these humps (and future humps).  The amount of shoddy analogies and simple misinformation in the media right now about bitcoins is tremendous.
* A good escrow service.  The "no givesies backsies" nature of bitcoins (and split-sends) are dangerous when trading goods over a distance.  In this sense, a delay on exchange of goods and currency might be needed, which other than waiting for confirmations now, does not exist.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:40:04
Yeah, you put a capcha on every trade request :)
They dont necessarily want this since they get paid on volume traded, and with a record 194,000 BTC being traded in the last 24 hours, they dont give a shit who's trading it or what the market does.
GOX crashed the bitcoin market... oh well more press -&gt; more buyers -&gt; more transactions.
They probably care very little what the price of bitcoins is at, they just want volume.  It is in their best interest to cause panic and make more trades happen :)
Something to think about.

I think amazon would lend more value, however google wallet is maturing nicely and would be a nice feature.  Both are capable.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:44:34
No, you could buy BTC at market rate with $USD (or gift cards) with amazon taking a fee (.75% as mentionned).
Or, when you buy something on amazon with BTC, your BTC would be converted to $USD automatically (at market rate + .75% fee) and the product paid for. 
Thirdly, you can exchange back and forth at your leisure as you would do on any other exchange, with similar fees.
Meaning you can buy with BTC (which is essentially just selling your BTC on the market and buying with the result), OR, buy BTC, OR, sell your BTC outright, all within the same platform.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:19:42
 I'll feel guilty about it then
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:06:22
No, using hundreds of addresses from what I can tell, if you inspect the individual addresses they are placing tons of bets for .01, but seems to be a positive run, a new one that was created less than an hour ago has 80btc in it already and total of 1500btc received.
Look at  you'll see an abnormal amount of .0015% txns.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:04:51
Unfortunately, trading is a non-parallel task, they have to happen in order.  This mean multithreaded trading is not possible.  THe likely cause of the issue is that the database that is being used to determine trades, again, due to the linear nature that a trade engine operates in, it is not possible to "scale" it out and just add more boxes.  The site itself is another story, that can be easily scaled.  The issues of bitstamp and btc-e are db/frontend related, but the issue with mtgox is trade engine related.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:36:09
 You could actually have a bitcoin vix a nd it would do well
