You should read 2 books that I think would point in the contrary. 
[The Case Against the Fed]( in pdf form for your enjoyment.
[Overthrown: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq](

That's good that someone out there remembers that. That can be devastating on a culture if they are no longer allowed to govern them selves.
I remember watching a special about [The Troubles]( and someone was saying it was sad that this next generation wouldn't know what they lost from the culture changing to the new rulers.
And a really good example (Terrible event in human history) would be Native Americans. Entire cultures destroyed and blatant murder on ancestors. I find myself thinking every once and a while "I really hope that modern day Native American know what was taken from them."  The sad part is they do. But what is to be done? You have to realize that there is nothing that can be done. You have to move on. The culture decays and rots after a generation or two. It would be unrecognizable to your grandparents.
All because some goon in some bullshit position had his palm lubed by some big business so he could fist fuck a culture.
