i feel like a retard tbh. i thought i was smart buying bitcoin at $2600 and selling it at $3200. Please tell me what i should do.

there is a reason why almost no serious investor has precious metals in their portfolio. the reason that it has no intrinsic use. if it is going the same way as gold or silver, then i really rather stay away from it. it really looks like it is though, which is the reason why i'm so hesitant to get back in.
in terms of store of value, it's a myth that gold or silver keeps up with inflation btw. not an important or relevant point here though. 
bitcoin has way more potential than being gold. if it starts to become like gold, then i'd rather say no thanks, because the value of gold is usually determined by speculation.

i know haha. i was so scared by the first dip before that i sold when i 'just about' broke even aka gained $600 for doing nothing. really though, i don't see it's value unless people actually start using it. right now everyone treats it like a fucking stock, which shouldn't be the case. if things continue this way, where i need to travel hours on end just to buy and sell bitcoin via atm machines, i really don't see it ever being used for it's intended purpose. i have not personally run into any stores who accept bitcoin.
I still don't see any adoption going on. This is really a stock more than a cryptocurrency at this point. I live in london, which has a shit ton of stores and places. Yet only 72 stores accept bitcoin, most of which i have never heard off. i genuinely want to start to buy stuff in bitcoin. once i can do that, sure it will be worth putting money into it.
I really don't understand how bitcoin can reach 5k per coin if no one is using it for it's bloody purpose. It calls itself a currency. It better start acting like one.
if i wanted to hold a bitcoin like a stock long term, i might have well invested in SPY.

 the price i guess does not represent its current use.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:37:53
true. i probably will go in once these problems are solved though.

could be. i'm just a little afraid though, that what it promises will never be delivered. the time it takes to transact, the inaccessibility of it, the lack of businesses using it. tbh it doesn't look like bitcoin is in clear waters yet. if they can start by getting the transaction stuff sorted out, then maybe. if one year down the road it still takes hours on end to transact, and less than 100 physical businesses adopt it, it wouldn't look good.
as a person who used to own bitcoin and wants to buy more, i really want to see the transaction crap sorted out. it should be instantaneous, but it isn't. it should also be easily accessible, but it isn't.

I wish...... more likely there are scare stories so that all those who propagate those stories can buy bitcoin cheaply and push the price right back up. Those lucky f***ers who bought bitcoin 1 day ago have already made $500 per bitcoin.

i should have bought more bitcoin :(
although i am happy it's rising
