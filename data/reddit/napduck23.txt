Last wenesday at the begining of the afternoon Paris time. Takes 3 working days normally (suposed to be 1-2.... But yeah usually it's 3). I'm mostly worried to have no answer :(

I don't live in Paris anymore... No physical distribution here... I think I'll try on kraken despite the terrible usd euro exchange rate...

Well I managed the sale part of an online shop... You're suposed to have what it needs to answer at least to major issues requests (which are issues about customers' money) ASAP. On overload moments you have to be ready to at least have automated answers so your customers know that their problem will be taken in consideration. Do you think that they don't have enough funds for this ? That would be scary... 
I just don't know what to do else to get an answer from them so I can react the right way. I feel like I've given them enough time now and that people should know that they could be fronting these kinds if issues using coinbase. 
Do you have any idea on what would be a more reliable way to buy bitcoins ? Even if more expensive ? I was thinking about changing to dollars and use kraken...

And not considering it's customers... 
No doubt that it's big but i'm really worried now ! Don't you believe that having money credited but not getting it on accounts for days and not giving any answer pointing an issue is weird as hell for a company of this size (or any other side actually). 
I do realize that the ammount of transactions might be huge right now... Any one from coinbase confirming that it's on a "waiting list" ? No... :(

The transfer was done on wenesday. It's my request that was done this weekend. Anyways I guess or hope they're is a reason but thé issue  i just not managed right...

Well you can consider researchs done... I'm aware of this... But not having even a simple resonse is very very concerning about their capacity to do what they do and their management seriousness. Do you think that you would leave customers with no responses for days when talking about thousands if you were running a company ? 
I would take any advice on other ways to buy bitcoins if you have some though ! ;)

Have fun in the great north cold ! ;)
Sorry to bother you but have you tried any other ways to buy bitcoins ? Anything else under 2% of fee/conversion rate would be fine. This was supposed to be the first of four waves of deposits but I didn't transfer the rest of the money because of how things are turning out of course... So it's still waiting as btc pushed 20% :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:46:15
What would be the best way to buy bitcoins without using coinbase according to you ??? 
I blocked my next waves of investments because of this issue and I'm very dispaointed to have missed out on 20% growth already... 
The most scary part of it is the lack of any response... This is increadible !!!

Kraken doesn't need me to change from euro to usd... I missunderstood how it worked a few days ago... Going for it ! 
Transferwise seems nice to know though ! Thanks ! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:47:24
Yeah I guess you're right ! 
I'd like to find another way to put in the rest of the money that should already be in... I'm not ready to gamble by sending them more money the same way and I'm on fomo on the other hand... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:13:56
7 days... That's why I'm worried now... I woukdn't have been that worried if I had any answer from them :( 
Scammish might be much of a strong word.... But dangerously badly managed seems to suit :/

Made the first request (and asked nicely of course) on sunday so they should have got it on monday. Another one yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:59:32
Thanks. Also kraken is a possibility but hiding behind no fees on deposit and buys they charge hard on the usd/euro exchange rate ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:56:46
I'll do this thanks !
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:25:05
Yes it does ! If it's thé reason I would like to ear a reason from someone from coinbase though... 
I didn't think that customer support was so inexistant though... Having you trying to do their job while they're getting paid for it seems incredible ! 
And unless they prove me wrong today. I'm not using it any more... Which is a normal reaction. 
Thx for caring though ;)
