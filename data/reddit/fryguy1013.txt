You realize a bit is already an eighth of a US dollar (half quarter), right? There is in fact precedence for using "bit" to represent a fractional amount of something. Given that nobody uses bit anymore, it seems fine to re-appropriate it for another currency.

Presumably, the script could be something like
     OP_PUSHDATA1 &lt;reputation-addr&gt; OP_RETURN
And this would make the transaction non-spendable, and then the reputation could be verified by the data you pushed.

Your principle is right, but the math isn't correct. The chances of matching a three bit string are (1/2)^3 or 1 in 8. In reality, it depends on the string you're matching, since 111 matches fewer 4 bit strings (3/16: 0111, 1110, 1111) than 110 (4/16: 0110, 1110, 1100, 1101). The second problem is that virus-scanners match bytes and not bits. This means there's 1 chance at breaking it per byte, so 2^40+5 bytes would have an expected 1 match. The final thing is that I see that the signature for DOS/Stoner is 10 bytes, not 40 bits. Perhaps I'm wrong.

The good news is that you can determine from the difficulty and the BTC/USD if it's profitable to be mining or not. If your hash/kilowatt \* USD/(killwatt\*hour) \* difficulty &gt;= mining reward \* USD/BTC, then it's profitable to mine.
Unfortunately, I think a lot of people don't do this calculation, and end up burning a lot of power for nothing.

Given that it's 40 bits for that signature, does that mean that the expected amount of random data to match that particular signature is only 1 terabyte?

For a specific instant in time sure, the expected time of the next block is ~10 minutes away. However, if you chart the delay between when a person submitted their spend and when it was committed to the block-chain, the average is going to be 5 minutes.

When I think of bitcoin, I think of the innovations that are unique to bitcoin: public ledger, proof of work, transactions, etc. The peer-to-peer part is the least important part of it, and just a given that it's possible to broadcast and receive the blocks of the ledger. The fact that it uses the bittorrent peer discovery/network protocol is an implementation detail. Bitcoin could just as well be implemented using some other peer-to-peer scheme and/or codebase and still be bitcoin.
It's sort of like saying "isn't Dropbox just ftp but with syncing?" or "isn't tor just bittorrent for web pages?". There's so much more that the top layer adds to the base layer that it's not worth considering them the same thing. Perhaps it's even better to say something more like "Isn't counterstrike just half-life?". In that case, they both are games made from the Source engine, and share common things. But they are both different things.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that you're technically right (or not, I don't know). But, being technically right doesn't make you actually right. Although, I think the other person is wrong because they think bittorrent is "bad" because the MPAA sues people for using it. Except the fact that bittorrent is used for many lawful things like Blizzard using it to distribute its own games, and Bittorrent sync as a dropbox replacement to sync between your own devices.

It isn't actually division involved if you get into the deep math of it. What it is saying is that 9 and 1 are the same element in the integers mod 4. So you've got the subgroups {1, 5, 9, 13, ...}, {2, 6, 10, 14, ...}, {3, 7, 11, 15, ...} and {0, 4, 8, 12, ...}, and are applying operations on the class. It's just convenient to represent the numbers as the number between 0 and n-1 (0, 1, 2, 3 in this case). To check if the numbers are in the same class, you can check if their difference is divisible by the mod. In this case (9 - 1) is divisible by 4.
This reason is why when using the congruence operator, it's written `9 ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and not the way it is in the video, because it's saying 9 and 1 are the same, and doesn't have anything to do with division. It's just a convenience that when dividing `y/x`, it results in `y = mx + b`, and that means `y ≡ b (mod x)` since `(y - b)/x = m` and `m` is an integer that means `y-b` is divisible by `x`.

They're payments from A to A, that require a key from B. So you have transaction fees, and lost funds if people don't turn them in (unless timelocking a future refund payment). Also, it seems confusing if you want to have a part two-signature and part non two-signature transaction if your amount is less. Do wallet programs support that without sweeping?

This has nothing to do with hashing rate. Assuming E(time between blocks) = 10 minutes, given a random instant, it is going to be (0 + 10)/2 = 5 minutes away from a block being confirmed.

An automated teller machine is basically a replacement for a teller that  you can talk to at a bank. If one of the services that a bank employee (teller) can serve is exchanging currency, then an automated teller machine would be within the realm of what this thing could be called. I've certainly gone to the bank and handed them rolls of quarters and then they gave me larger bills of the same amount.
However, that being said, an ATM is generally a machine that's built to withdraw and deposit cash from your bank account. Calling this an automated currency exchange or something like that might be more clear.
They do call currency conversion machines ATMs, at least somewhere:

Craps isn't a multi-player game though. The house knowing that the next roll is going to be a 7 doesn't change what people are going to bet on.
However, the one flaw that wouldn't necessarily be obvious is that they can take your random number, and then brute force find another random number that causes the RNG to produce a losing hand for you. However, it looks like they handle this case by committing to a seed  before knowing yours, at least the comments say so:
            // Next, extract the server's seed from the game_seed and SHA-256 it, and make sure the hash matches the hash provided
            // before the hand is dealt.

It's a total "tide goes in, tide goes out, you can't explain it" line of questioning. If you answer the question then he's got some series of other leading questions about how does the government get the right to harm people. Especially with how technically worded it is. It's better to not answer the question and put the questioner on the defensive instead.
Besides, it's not even a valid line of question. Yes, a citizen does have the right to initiate force against another citizen who has not initiated force or threatened to initiate force against them. If someone tries to steal your property, you do have the right to prevent them from doing that by force if necessary. And it's equally possible to delegate that ability to another person. And equally if someone is on your property and you don't want them there you can forcefully remove them. Even if you want to charge them some amount of money to be there, if they don't want to pay you can remove them from your property by force.

It doesn't matter, because the ability of the state doesn't come from the people transferring their own ability to do so to the state. It comes from a social contract, in which the people of the society agree to be held to the rules of the society in order to be part of the society.
Besides, I agree with This is clearly a philosophy question about how can the state exist at all. If you're a senator that's already a given. There's not going to be a vote for "should we disband the government and live in anarchy". It's only a question to make the person being asked look bad.

You probably spend some dust to the notification address for another set of addresses.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:59:44
From reading the documentation linked below, you spend some dust to a notification address and then have 2^32 addresses that you can send your actual bitcoin to, that only you and the recipient know.
If you compare it to the electrum wallet, what electrum does is has a single master key that you enter and it generates a stream of addresses that you can give out. As each one is used, you give out the next one. The BIP47 process is similar to this except that the sender can determine the next wallet to send to without asking you for it. And given that it's per-person, a second person wouldn't be able to figure out the addresses that another person chose.

Saying another way: in a [spherical bitcoin in a vacuum world]( people determine Bitcoin as having being $X/bitcoin because miners are spending $X/bitcoin of electricity/overhead for each block, and miners spend electricity because it has worth. It's sort of a circular loop. But if suddenly they receive half the mining reward then either X stays the same and half of the miners are going to quit mining (which reduces the total electricity costs), the price of bitcoin needs to double, or some combination of the two.

*In general*, state laws override federal laws. States can't have unconstitutional laws (civil rights). That's why the commerce clause is used to make federal laws more important than state laws, by claiming that they are inter-state things which is something federal law can regulate. IANAL though.

This isn't exactly how it works but an analogy is, but assume you're multiplying two 12 digit numbers, 111,111,111,111 x 999,999,999,999 by long multiplication. You end up with:
                     111 111 111 111
                   x 999 999 999 999
                     ---------------
                     999 999 999 999
                   9 999 999 999 99
                  99 999 999 999 9
                 999 999 999 999
               9 999 999 999 99
              99 999 999 999 9
             999 999 999 999
           9 999 999 999 99
          99 999 999 999 9
         999 999 999 999
       9 999 999 999 99
    + 99 999 999 999 9
                      99 876 543 21  (carry row)
    --------------------------------
                      99 999 999 999
Then you go column by column from right to left doing the long addition. The first column is 9 so you write the 9 in the first column, the second is 18 so you write an 9, and put a 1 in the next carry column, and the third is 29, so you put a 2 in the carry and so on until the first column that contains the row that adds up to 109. In this case, you're supposed to put a 9 in the result, and a 0 in the carry, and a 1 in the carry after that. Assume that the circuit designer could build a circuit that could multiply any two 12 digit numbers correctly (including the weird carry cases), or one that couldn't calculate some of them but was 5% faster. For normal computing it would be disastrous to use the flawed multiplier, but the paper is proposing is using a flawed one, because it's extremely unlikely that any random multiplication would encounter this problem, and if it does, it could just try another number.
The paper is describing a different kind of flaw when multiplying numbers that has to do with the fact that the additions are performed in parallel, and minimizing the amount of time you have to wait before carrying from the right all the way to the left.

Think of one of those things they use at casinos when playing slot machines. You put some cash into a slot machine, and then cash out and it gives you a voucher with a dollar amount on it. If you were allowed to use it at the casino restaurant, they would probably charge your bill to it, destroy the voucher, and print you a new one with the adjusted value. They aren't allowed to just write on it a new value. It's the same principle.
