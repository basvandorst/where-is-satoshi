The method above will have no GDAX fee whatsoever. The network fee I mentioned goes to the miners for whichever chain you are transacting on. I'm confused, you bought BTC and sent it to an ethereum wallet? Can you link the transaction on a block explorer? I might be able to help more if I can see the tx.

I think it used to be that, but they've lowered the minimum recently.

I wish I had a bitcoin for each "uh" he said.

The free way: transfer $ to Coinbase USD wallet. Once it arrives, log in to GDAX and click deposit, select Coinbase USD wallet. Set limit buy orders below the current market price and there will be no fee. The only fee you'll pay is the network fee if you move the coins to an external wallet.

No, the system we have is a constitutional republic.

I think it is actually. The news would effectively decide our laws. People would decide on laws based on which side had a better hour long special.

That isn't correct, right? It says segwit is active.

One comment on overall network efficiency: the difficulty is a arbitrary mechanism to make the overall network less efficient. If difficulty = 1, blocks would take under a second each. So total network efficiency really isn't a goal here.
