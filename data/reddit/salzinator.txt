I take it you are a conspiracy theorist lol.  Instantly went to the extreme in quantum entanglement.  Read some leaked documents.  You will see that they most certainly are not close to quantum anything.  They can’t even decrypt PGP communication yet.

I knew that we never hit $19k+.  Glad that was a figment of my imagination.  I don’t know what I would do if I held through that.

This is a good start!  I'm fluent in English and French, but my Spanish was good enough to watch this whole video.

Not that I know of. Everything is speculated, secreted, or individually singled out to be investigated.
