Wow that is a very nice Christmas tree base. Where can you buy those with Bitcoins?

Get a lawyer that knows what bitcoins are.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:00:21
Not sure man, hopefully not!

I actually made a post last week on r/leagueoflegends about Riot accepting bitcoins, but it didn't get a very positive response.

About 30 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:56:04
Is this the real life
Or is this just fantasy?
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:41:49
Yeah, if anyone wants to practice tippin, go ahead and practice on me.

Yeah, it was a rough print for the first one just to see what it looks like. Thanks for the advice!

I would recommend selling them in chunks so you have a better idea of how much return you will be getting. Also, if you need help with the bitcoin tip send me a message, I would be more than happy to help you.

Noooooo I'm too late :(
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:00:12
Has it stopped yet?

GSpotAssassin is a legend here in the world of r/Bitcoin. Handing out B's like no other. Rock on GSpot.

I also use double spaces, therefore I am Satoshi. 
FEEL FREE TO TIP ME, THE ALMIGHTY SATOSHI

Thank you everyone for the info. Sounds like it wouldn't be a good idea. Also, no one around me is on localbitcoin so I will just have to wait I guess. I just want some to play with.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:21:35
I have passed the tip on to the owner of the printer and your Bitcoin will be ready within a few weeks :D
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:49:24
I love you
You love me
Let's give bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:14:58
Yeah, sure, I'll give you a free one.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:41:18
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:43:46
Thank you, friend. You seem like you know what you're doing. Would you recommend buying today? If I had lots of bitcoins I would definitely tip you.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:39:15
Why? That's what I was planning on using.

Sounds like a good start to me. Don't explain your situation until you have met the lawyer and gained trust. This is a lot of money you're dealing with.
