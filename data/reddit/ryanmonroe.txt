In what sense do you own a share of that cash if they aren't paying you anything? Non-rhetorical question. I don't think there's any way to force them to do a buyback and you don't get anything in the case of bankruptcy, so I'm not sure what you mean here.

Sure, if you assume the market for them is efficient. And if you make that same assumption about Bitcoin you get the same conclusion.

This is such a dumb phrase (when used earnestly, and not as a legal disclaimer). If the future was totally disconnected from the past we'd never know what is going to happen at any time at all. Will the computer I'm using explode, then turn into a dragon and eat me? Well nothing we've ever seen before would lead me to believe that could happen, but past performance does not predict future results...so...

I’m saying the principle that the past is not useful at all in determining future events is insane, and that’s what the phrase I was replying to means. Maybe not the best post to make that point, given the image in OP obviously doesn’t provide any useful information about the future for BTC. But if you have any opinion at all on the future of BTC (it will fall/rise/stay stable), it is 100% based on the past, because the past is literally all we have available to us to form any opinion about anything. So the actual effect of this advice, if it is to really be followed, is to not ever have any opinion about the future price of any asset.

So do you have any opinion about any asset? If so, what do you base that opinion on, if not the past?

Even if you pay in cash it's the same opportunity cost.
