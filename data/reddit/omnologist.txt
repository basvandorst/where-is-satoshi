I’m with ya but in a different way. I took a loan out against my bitcoin to buy more bitcoin.

Go for it. With great risk come great reward. Swing for the fences as long as you understand the commitment. Fuck , you’re young, take out 100,000 in loans and if you’re wrong file bankruptcy. What’s the worst that could happen
@_date: 2019-03-09 08:48:27
I understand the volatility part. I’m long bitcoin and want to put my money where my mouth is so to speak. 
Thank you for the advice!

I’m going to sell it for the equivalent of $160,000 usd
It would be awesome to have that many bitcoins if it sold. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 03:10:46
I don’t mind waiting for the house to sell, just want more bitcoin and want to practice what I preach. This is all good advice, please keep it coming if anyone else has good suggestions. 
Are there any places to list real estate that’s for sale exclusively for bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-03-11 03:32:49
You look forward to others misfortune just because you don’t believe in bitcoin. Interesting phrasing that probably speaks volumes about your character. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 08:46:29
No not a joke. I have investment properties, I want to sell one of them to acquire more bitcoin, as well as spread the word.

Publicity for bitcoin mainly. Whoever buys it will just have to transfer fiat to bitcoin and send. I will look into an escrow or attorney that can help. 
Thanks for the advice

Clever but I prefer a stop loss algorithm

You can’t price the money that is expected to come in. Bitcoin isn’t speculation, it’s literal. Supply demand.

@_date: 2018-10-27 15:39:50
I like that the market isn’t moving spelt on speculation. This will drive prices up because people will actually buy bitcoin. A real supply and demand model

I set these up to mine when bitcoin was 15k+ , I was going to be sooo rich... :)  I have a 50MW solar system though and since they are in an office my electric ranges from .07 - .15 depending on peak , non-peak rates. 
I had to have electricity wired and buy a bunch of equipment and spent a fortune for this little science experiment, and it keeps getting more and more difficult to mine adequate bitcoin to break even, but still I think its a pretty cool set up. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 05:59:58
Should banks also be bound to this rule? No electricity for the millions of banks in the country?

Bitcoin has been boring lately. Can it be adopted and regulated already so everyone will invest in it. How much longer must we all wait! 
I’m hodler since 2015 so I’m not being impatient, I’m just ready already
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:54:36


Yes I know. Just excited. Been excited for years. . Not touching my investment til 1 BTC=150k though. . So not desperate, just ready to play.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:35:41
I’ve been in the bitcoin space for years my fellow hodler. My question I guess is if there are decentralized mortgage companies or non traditional options

Do you think they could hurt bitcoin. What if they only use the libra and don’t link bitcoin into it at all? Wouldn’t that be horrible for bitcoin. Do you think Facebook could be trying to take over?

I’m not sure I agree 100%. I know the news says it speculative but what other investment has 200 billion and is considered speculative?

@_date: 2018-11-22 13:27:01
How much electricity do all the banks in the world use. I imagine bitcoin uses far less and is more concerned running greener to maximize profit of mining

That’s what I’m thinking too, that people will add to the market as individual investors.

So you think bitcoin doesn’t stand a chance ? 
What is your background? Are you a stock trader? Curious
@_date: 2019-09-17 05:32:20
But bitcoin will hopefully &gt; than double so the amount of money will stay the same or increase as well

From my understanding it means that it will be traded on E*TRADE and institutions like that. It means people can invest their retirement into it, it makes it accessible to investment firms 
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:06:49
Why do you think institutional money hasn’t jumped in yet? 
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:03:38
You would say that Morty.
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:29:21
Right now cash money is used for all of those. It’s not like prostitution and drugs didn’t exist before bitcoin. Truth is, no matter what system is in place there will be criminals that abuse it so I don’t subscribe to that argument that’s been spoon fed on mainstream media to scare the mainstream lemmings.

I never thought of that. Essentially $18,000,000 new money has to go in everyday for bitcoin price to remain stable at 10k
