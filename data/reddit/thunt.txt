I agree.  I'm impressed at how easy it is to use.

I'm very much in favor of encouraging trash pickup, but I'm afraid they'll just rob trash from other trash cans and bring it to you.... ;)

I think you (we, the internet) just need to keep describing why we want Facebook to accept bitcoin and why it would be useful to us.  (the idea being, if we explain it really well and the facebook people read it, the power of a good idea will win them over, and then everybody wins).
I recently heard some good ideas for Facebook bitcoin on MadBitcoins (paying friends for meals, paying friends back for loans, buying things like concert tickets directly, facebook being it's own bank....)  Anyone have any other ideas?  A grand theory as to why Facebook should accept bitcoin?  (post em!)

maybe add a banner explaining this across the top of your website, or at least put a bitcoin accepted here button up, because if you have to push add to cart, checkout and login before you can see the bitcoin button, you might lose people.

This is the email that works.  Paypal just called me in the evening to say that they read my story and felt sorry for how I had been treated and were sending me a full refund.  
Paypal is a class act and really came through in this situation.  Very relieved to be done with Butterfly labs.  Thank You Paypal, Thank you Reddit, Thank you Tharlam!

So far I set up a dwolla account, a blockchain.info wallet and downloaded a program to make my computer run slow from Bit Minter....  
I believe in the idea, from way back and shoulda bought in then.  Tough to say if it will last, given the current server assaults and however the back end works (not too sure yet).  Obviously getting amazon or a mega merchant to accept it would help.  Less confusion about the trading and banking ecosystem would also help ease access to new users.  (one website said I could take money to 7-11 and they would convert it for me.  Sounds strange. but exciting)

How to use 2-factor authentication on MTgox:
1. Login, go to Security Center
(assuming you installed Google Authenticator on your phone)
2. Add new software authenticator
3. Scan QR code with Google Authenticator software
4. Input code from Cell phone.
--- Done.  Now set your "login, withdrawal, security center" or all three to use this authentication and you're all set.
(now you have to use your phone to generate a token anytime you want to login or withdraw or change security settings.)
I really think this should be on by default and it was way easier to configure than I thought.  Coinbase uses Authy (Very similar, but I think by default or at least with easier instructions).

kinda torn whether the OP should offer a webpage that prints what you want on the postcard (text or drawing) and then sends it  or a service where OP makes a special unique work of art postcard and then mails it to people who have signed up (maybe generating a waitlist and doing one a day for a year)....  
I think I just like the idea of microtransactions of bitcoins causing stamps and paper to move and small profits for the mover.  Not sure if that really works out economically though.  I guess while btc is on the way up everything works....

didn't look like it supported multiple for a single section (at least based on the drop down box).
It would be good to have the wubikey and the googleAuth so that you could use different security for each option...  I might have to order one after all.  Don't know why the logo one is the same price as the non-logo one though.  I guess if you were really super paranoid you wouldn't want mtgox's logo on your key, but then I guess you'd pay more.... and in the same vein if I was advertising for them I'd want to pay less.  Also I'd want to pay less than $30 for a security key as well (but then again, I'm small time bitcoin.  I guess if you had over 1K or over 10K, $30 would seem like small potatoes.)


You're spot on there.  It's absurd.  Once you activate 2-factor security, it should automatically suggest that you turn it on for the security center.  (in general their whole security section is confusing, and should be more direct about helping people protect their accounts before they get stolen).


(I didn't know Google auth did more than one site before this, but now that I know this, I agree with you that Coinbase could have just gone with the familiar already installed GAuth and saved me some icon space.)
I wonder if Coinbase will become more like MtGox or Mtgox will become more like coinbase.  Whether it's more important to work on the interface or to build a more robust and bulletproof exchange.  Different goals I guess.  User friendly vs. hardcore tech problems.

totally new at this -- is it too late to buy?  How do you get "tips"?  Is everyone here a paper billionaire now?

mystery solved... (Authy and Coinbase are bothy Y Combinator projects...)
Authy is a Y Combinator backed startup launching today....
