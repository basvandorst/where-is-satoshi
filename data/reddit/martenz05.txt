I'm not too optimistic. Rõivas (the PM) is just a loyal and obedient stand-in for the few months before the elections in March 2015. In the meantime, the veterans of Reform (Rõivas' party) are busy deciding who permanently fills the vacuum left by Ansip (the previous PM, also Reform) retiring from local politics and settling in to an irrelevant but well-paid position in Brussels.

There is most definitely waste involved. The money paid to bureaucrats and officials stays in the economy, yes, but it is not producing any new value in the process. The money paid to bureaucrats represents a lost opportunity; it represents capital which a private company with a smaller tax burden could have used to expand a productive enterprise and create actual, productive jobs, instead of being used to pay bureaucrats whose only job is the redistribution of already-existing wealth.

Not citizenship. E-residency. The important distinction being that 'e-residency' gives you an Estonian digital identity, but without the additional perks and obligations that come with full citizenship such as voting in elections or paying personal income tax in Estonia.

Not really. He can sanction gov'ts that do it, but he can't actually block them or prevent their decisions from being legally binding. The member states of the EU are still sovereign, just look at Poland pushing hard against the migrant resettlement plans.
