real money? but you buy bitcoins with dollars. bitcoins value is only known due to the dollar. 
so with out the dollar how do you determine bitcoins value?

what does bitcoin have to back up its value? the dollar has billions of users and has the u. s.  gdp backing up the dollar.

Gold vs bitcoin which would you choose?

That wasn't exactly what I mean by legitimate, I guess I am using the wrong word. What I am trying to say is, is Bitcoin safe? Are there safety measures to protect your money, basically where does the buck stop. Literally.

ok got that part. How likely do you think Bitcoin will survive and not crash to make those saved coins worth value? Is there any downside or would this just be another donation stream?
@_date: 2012-11-22 07:11:22
How legitimate is bitcoin?

How would you like 10,000 bitcoins as a welcome gift?
@_date: 2012-11-22 08:41:18


that sounds like the conservative thing to do. I am no longer an undecided opinionator.

I was referring to Bitcoin's volatility and if possible a system node crash or blockchain crash. Im pretty green on this Bitcoin subject but these are beginner questions an investor would want to know.

Who says they can't print them up. All systems can be hacked. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 19:40:11
What if they use bitcoins to pay for wars.
@_date: 2013-01-07 19:46:44
But everyone is not using bitcoin. It is a huge jump that I just don't see happening. 
@_date: 2013-01-06 23:51:05
Bitcoin won't be used by governments. Why would they use a system they do not control.
@_date: 2013-01-07 03:50:18
because they will make up their own digital form of currency 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:29:44
FUCK THE RACOON!! BITCH MIGHT HAVE RABIES N SHIT.
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:15:43
They might be terrorists. /s
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:07:51
Its not. Shit I was surprised when 10% wasn't the standard anymore. 
@_date: 2013-01-06 20:50:46
digital currency will happen in our lifetime, but it sure as hell wont be bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:14:26

@_date: 2013-01-22 02:22:47
How much money flows threw bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:33:55
Because man its the man man

Are taxes stealing? Or just stealing if they go against your political view. Which I do think a percentage of taxes should be up to the citizen to determine where their money goes.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:24:53
Damn greedy Jews.
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:54:47
Why must we worry about what other people pay? So if rich payed more and the poors rate stayed the same... would the poor still be punished?
