Bitcoin is more then money.  It is the ultimate liberator.  The straights, the gays, the whites( even the ones with the reds on their necks) and the blacks and the grays, all appreciate it's power.  Also bitcoins liberties can be obtained without the permissions of the governmentz.

Saving almost in fiat??? are you looney???  At the G20 conference a couple weeks ago they declared any money in a bank is cannon fodder for bail-ins, and you are now on the hook for any derivative blow ups as of a few days ago (read crude oil prices), Euro zone and the US are now slipping negative interest rates.  (saving in a cold wallet at 0% than a certain loss at -.2 percent in fiat.  Printing yadda yaddah.  At least metals!!! Fiat is only good for paying bills and ninja transactions.  AS for me I have a fiat job and a bitcoin job.  Pay my bills in fiat and dump the rest into cold storage.

The dudes from India and other fiat failure countries know exactly what Bitcoin is at this point.  Aswin S is a hero in the sense that his supervisors will keep getting bombareded with customers , and responses like this.  Many of the companies that take BTC now did it because their employees were big fans of it.  Amazon survives on a very small margin, and the sales tax arbitrage that they don't have to pay vs. B&amp;M stores.  Bitcoin is ....as we all know a natural for Amazon.  Just need to do a little forest clearing first.

Bitcoin is like digital realestate (mobile home) on its blockchain(land) that can be given to anyone freely to own/access a piece of the blockchain.  Once you own it, you can do what you want with it (create an app, store of value, color coins etc)  Blockchain is great because it is constantly being verified as pure truth of the activities on it by many blockchain maintainers called miners. Even real land erodes or falls into the sea. (Elevator door opens and she watched my ass sway out of the elevator, cant resist, and looks my name up in the company directory, and get a new stalker)  Fuckin Bitcoin man.

Well they are on exchanges.  That is rule 101.  We all know this.  But it will say 10.7 BTC and say 5 BTC pending (for repayment)  I know they said about a year ago that they were going to make the final payment, but volume really dried up when Bitcoin was super low at teh end of last summer.  Math wise I get it, but faithwise who knows.  The good thing is that the space is more mature, and if they pull an exit scam, there is more accountability and the risk reward of an exit scam are diminishing.  It is becoming more profitable to run a legit exchange now that govt's are beginning to know what to look for.....But exit scam is still firmly on the table.

Not for bitcoin tokens themselves.  There is no leverage built into the protocol.  Bank runs happen when people lose confidence that a 3rd party will cover your withdrawal at anytime.  This cannot happen with token on the blockchain, bitcoins stored in exchanges is a completely different story.

lol  That takes time my friend.  People have to understand the power of the blockchain first.  The best way is to get it out there and have people learn for themselves, and be believers.  I told them to first put out a RFI to first too see how it can be used, then once people understand, then to RFP's to build a system...etc. etc.  I really don't expect anyone to get it quite yet, but when they do it will take care of it self.   But CT is a broken state, and they don't call it the land of steady habits for no reason.  Also the blockchain is too transparent for the real workings of the state to happen.  ;)

WTF does he really think banks are going to be playing that big a role in the future financial system.  Isn't it supposed to be P2P.

I wish I had the balls to hold on to dollars in my confiscatable bank account denominated in constantly devaluing dollars, with zero and soon to be negative interest rates.  Since I don't have he patience to wait for or the desire to hold long enough any stocks to wait until I get a physical certificate of ownership, I get scared of them too, since Cede &amp; Co. holds all US stocks w/o a cert.  Forget that shit.  Bonds are in a 300 year bubble.  I wish I had the balls to play chicken with that shit.  
I envy your risk tolerance, but you are married and have a family, and you should be more cautious with your future.    I really do admire how you just throw caution to the wind and hold most of your value in 3rd party custodial accounts.  ;)   But you only live once right.  Rock on and praise satan \m/

There are many other uses for bitcoin before it matures to be a currency.  Most currencies are deemed currency out of the gate, because some one says so.  Bitcoin is starting from the opposite direction and is getting all its hits at the beginning of its life, where all fiats get most of their major problems at the end of their lives....since they are unfixable.

Coinbase has the most trusted name in Bitcoin.  They are on the frontlines and have dealt great with compliance.  If you want some shady operation, go use them, and maybe you will get your coins maybe not.  AS laws change Coinbase will change with it.

The protocol doesn''t get hacked, only businesses and entities built on top of the protocol.   I couldn't even get that far, but this shows me that education of blockchain technologies right now is the most important thing now that bitcoin has a nice base now to work off of.

That is essentially what most hope to be moving towards.  In this current paradigm we are far off from that, but technologies like blockchain (bitcoin), automation, and thinks we haven't seen yet are getting us as a race to be the best we can be.  First move is to free ourselves from the shackles of other people (central banks, "authorities" etc.) Once that takes place, the collective creativity of humans can really accelerate....but who knows what that will bring.   is offering many ways for people to go past the moon and head in the direction of Venus ;)

Well the worst part was that he wouldn't let me explain how it works, and he was the one that brought up the bank hack thing.   I'll always don my Coinbase and Blockchain stickers at my desk!!!  next is an r/Bitcoin sticker :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 05:51:20
oops  fixed it sorry.  (frozen fingers) haha.  There might be a protocol for that in the future, but for now a transparent voting system is the most important feature.

They are working as hard and as fast as they can for a company with new massive volume for many reasons.  The teams are super efficient, and a big factor that clogs their response time is duplicate, triplicate requests for the same issue.  Multiple responses for the same issue in a few hour time span only slows everyone's response time down. They'll get to you, just be patient.

Don't forget this weekend is has an extra banking holiday day on Monday.  Banks tend to ow down ach processing before a long weekend.  Unfortunately Coinbase or anyother company using ACH rails cannot control when banks process a transaction.  Also make sure you are in compliance with their requests.  Sometimes just uploading your ID, if you haven't already can solve the issue.

Nice.  Soo Mining overcapacity, and a bigger block size will make transactions cheaper.  I see where this is going :)

That is how I learned about Bitcoin.  I'm in the US, and was visiting friends in Brasil.  Of course I came with the requisite bags of gifts.  Sending money via paypal or banks were not an option for the reasons you mentioned.   
BTC was the only option, and have been hooked ever since. This was 2012 and the BTC world is much different now.  You made the correct choice with BTC.
