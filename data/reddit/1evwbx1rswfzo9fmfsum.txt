There is no black and white scenario. No one is saying scale blocks to 1 GB so we can compete wirh Visa today. However, the opposition to even a slight (2 MB) block size increase thay together with segwit and other BIPs could facilitate a 400% growth in possible transaction volume is currently ar beat childish, and at worst obstructive and self serving. Possibly due to an unnatural concentration of developers spearheading private off chain projects that stand to only benefit from a block size freeze.

Really? Letting a third party propagate transactions as a necessity could lead to anything. They could theoretically charge very high fees in a future thay relies on bitcoin payments. Or cause crashes by malfunctioning, any number of terrible scenarios. If Bitcoin users start relying on faster transactions, there is a value split between Bitcoin and the payment channel provider and the payment channel provider has the upper hand.

When both are needed, it's a bad idea. Also, what I mean with Bitcoin protocol is the Blockchain. Not sidechain or payment channel that is not directly recorded in the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:19:19
A wise man once said that Bitcoin transaction volume wouldn't be a problem becuase you can always upgrade the network with forks since data capacity and internet grows faster than the block size requirements. I wonder if that was Satoshi. Oh it was. If miners could handle 1 MB blocks in 2012, then they can handle 2 MB blocks in 2017.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:54:51
Not at all. It's an example. The bigger picture is that there is no rational reason not to love to a bigger blocksize, and it is also the natural way for Bitcoin Bitcoin to scale. Together with segwit etc. If you oppose larger blocks I expect a hell of a lot more reasoning than "lightning is gonna solve it anyway" or "it's just FUD".
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:21:45

@_date: 2016-06-21 04:24:29
The fact that segwit adds some space (0.7 mb) it's only a stopgap to larger block size. Stonewalling a block size increase is not constructive. And I for one dong consider lightning a correct way to scale Bitcoin because it's not part of the bitcoin protocol but a private project. Not sure if people care, but to me third party solutions to Bitcoin protocol issues just isnt a viable strategy for expanded growth.
@_date: 2016-06-21 04:45:07
I think it's a very clear distinction between open source code produced by the developers of Bitcoin and implemented through soft or hard forks. And a private company running a service for the purpose of making money. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:34:03
Sure, but my main point was that early adopters spending Bitcoin literally created the value. Withoit them, no Bitcoin would have spread to people outside of the inner circle, no value would be created and no services would adopt it. Holding is great, but not in an initial adoption phase. Case and point the 10.000 pizza, that has done more for adoption than any other transaction.

@_date: 2016-06-27 19:15:42
You are right, but it's also complete horseshit. If a few obstructionist developers would stop spreading fear and disinformation about block size increases we would reach consensus quickly. LukrJR's argument regarding decentralization dangers are pointless and dangerous, and most people realize this. If bitcoin is to move forward and adapt, we can't lag on capacity because we take into consideration people that run full nodes on a laptop from 1999 on a DSL.

After 10 months of gloating and putting down Bitcoin, they can have it.
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:31:12
Because it's entirely possible that Ethereum investors did so in the premise that the DAO ether was locked up and was going to be disbursed in a controlled manner, decreasing the available supply. When this becomes not only untrue but also leads to a fork at no fault of the Ethereum network, it's obviously a value destroyer. See. Ethereum price.

Ha ha. Do you do birrhday parties?
@_date: 2016-06-22 06:20:52
It's not technical analysis, it's a decreasing supply curve. And there are great reasons for accepting that it's relevant because of increased adoption over time, and decreasing supply at set times.

And the "decentralization" argument is moot since the percentage of people running core at home and solo mining is miniscule vs. mininf farms that has no issue with 2, 5 or 10 MB blocks already today.

and again, and again, and again. Until Bitcoin is unusable for anything except 5 figure transactions. Well, I guess that is 'The solution'. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:03:44
Did I say that everyone should run every node on Amazon? Are you incapable of using an example to extrapolate a point? Obviously my point is that running a node is not prohibitively expensive as it is, and double blocksize won't change thay. If you have an interest in keeping Bitcoin alive, it is cheaper with 2 MB blocksize bow, than it was with 1 MB 2 Yeas ago. So the decentralization cost argument is moot. As far as classic nodes trending down, I can promise that it's not due to some prohibitive cost for nodes. Possibly a drop off of Bitcoin enthusiasts willing to run nodes. Who knows. But considering hard drive space and bandwidth being at all time low, it's not cost.

What happened to mircea popescu admitting he was the "hacker" (user) of the contract?
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:30:22
No matter how this is resolved, they are screwed. The worst case scenario for ETH is a hard fork. That will evaporate all faith in smart contracts on their platform in an instant edit. I don't really think there is an altericaive to a hard fork, but it will be costly. That said, Ethereum price is down 65% since the back so maybe it's getting priced in. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:23:43

@_date: 2016-06-20 21:04:51
"Having an issue sending transactions" If by issues you mean transaction cost rising 10x every year, and ballooning 100%+ every time transaction volume rises, with 100% full blocks and new users getting transactions stuck because they can't keep up with what the transaction cost is every day, then yeah. I have issues. Do you run a large mining operation on a 2400 baud modem, causing you to not be able to handle 2 MB blocks?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:06:40

Personally I feel like we owe the Ethereum project a huge thank you for acting as the "turn &amp; burn" beta for smart contracts. The wealth of information flowing from the DAO crash, and the lessons that are to be learned will benefit Rootstock immensely and make smart contracts on the bitcoin Blockchain exponentially better, and safer. All withoit risking any Bitcoin in the process.

The community can do whatever it wants. That's not going to repair the damage thay is done to the trust in immutable and secure contracts. That obviously are not that, if a community consensus can break their trust. Obviously I understand that it's terrible to lose a ton of money, but then again. Maybe people shouldn't be throwing their money at code that is in beta, to the tune of $200 million.

Not at all. These types of contract generally do not dissuade class action lawsuits at all since they can be filed just fine anyway. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:38:05

In what world? I'm pretty sure that I speak for most of the community if I say that it's not our problem if you just really really want to run a full node on a computer and modem from 1997. Holding up development out of fear that people just wont run nodes isn't a good idea. If the community can't keep node count up with larger blocks, then bitcoin deserves to fail.

Sure, but that's also not my point. My point is that someone with possibly $100 million in Bitcoin, would have a hell of a lot more important things to do than mini-trade on MtGox, and if he wanted money he could very easily sell Bitcoin to any of the core developers without Escrow by just showing them he owns an early block (doesn't even have to be one knows as Satoshi block, since in the first year pretty much everyone in the community knew and trusted each other , even though anonymous)

Agreed. Craig is just a 'third wheel' that happened to remain alive after the death of the creators. The reason it has taken several years for him to 'come out' is the long time that the brute force cracking of the private key passwords has taken even with access to super computers.

You may very well be correct, my Finney connection is mostly based on both of their participation in the metzdowd.com list and Finney's opportune mining (he mined block 70, and Satoshi's first transaction is to his address.) and transaction history, something a part of the 'Satoshi' team could be conceived doing.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:57:05
Not even close. MtGox operated for over a year as the default exchange, with no serious issues and a very good reputation. none of what's listed points to any serious lack of judgement. Almost every single high profile person in bitcoin has been 'involved' by proxy in some form of scam or bankruptcy, which is completely understandable considering the volatile nature of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:05:06

@_date: 2016-05-04 13:14:56
That is not true. He privately messaged core developers later, telling them he was 'moving on to other things' and that bitcoin was safe in their hands. But yeah, no public communication verified as Satoshi since 2010.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:03:48
My theory for quite a while is that Hal Finney and Dave' Wright were Satoshi. Though post Dave's death is it possible Craig Wright got a hold of the USB with David's encrypted private key. This would explain the time lapse between Dave's death and the 'reveal' as cracking 40+ character passwords would take considerable time, even with access to a possible super computer or cluster. 
This is strengthened by the fact that Dave is in Australia, and the first announcement and block mined fit the timeframe: 
Note that the Jan 09 time above is UTC +8, it's Satoshi (pretending to be) in Asia or Western Australia.
Block 1 timestamp: 1231469665 Fri: 09 Jan 2009 02:54:25 GMT

@_date: 2016-05-06 21:44:18
The transaction still works in this way to keep track of balances. Basically every time you send a payment you tell the Blockchain "Hello, I have $200 and want to send $30, here you go." And the Blockchain says "OK, thank you, here is $170 back" and it always knows how much you have that way. Crazy simplified but that's ballpark how it works. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 05:14:44

@_date: 2016-05-03 23:52:57
Honestly, that feels more likely than Craig being Satoshi. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:06:51
You can't really fault him for 90% of the accusations. MtGox was a renowned and respected business for most of it's time. Hearn can say whatever he wants. MMglobal just pays to become a member, there is no review process, MyBitcoin was as scam, and no one knew before they disappeared. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:58:11
Absolutely. I still won't believe he is Satoshi, but rather that he is defrauding the estate of Dave Kleinman of a massive amount of money. There is simply no way that this douchey fratboy was the same person that had the level headed and intelligent conversations that were posted to Bitcointalk or the early cryptography board where Bitcoin came alive. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:44:48
My guess is a group, involving among others Kleiman, and possibly in the periphery Wright. One thing is for sure though, Wright is NOT the person communicating through the crypto mailing list or Bitcointalk.

Dave Kleinman is a FAR more likely candidate for Satoshi than Craig. Craig strikes me as a wheeling and dealing douchebag that has absolutely no problem lying when it fits him. He's boisterous and has a massive ego. The Satoshi that posted on Bitcointalk and through the crypto mailing list was almost timid, and eager to soak up knowledge and advice. The two do NOT match up even the slightest. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:03:30
No. But it could be used to brute force the 40+ character password that it may have been encrypted with if he had access to the encrypted private key.

How does he fit for being a genius? Because he has hundreds of million in Bitcoin and still owes the Australian IRS millions? Because he is according to all testimonies a mediocre programmer? Because he chose to fake the first signature with which he claimed to be Satoshi? To me, he reeks of a 3rd rate scam artist. 
But that's not even the damning part to me. The thing that makes it insanely unlikely is the fact that he made the call that faking the 9th block signing was a good idea. He tried to fool, the people that he supposedly worked alongside. The people that he KNEW was going to figure it out. The people that he was trying to convince. THAT proves he is not smart enough to be Satoshi, and he does not have the blockchain knowledge to be Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:02:16
So what are you talking about? There has been no spends from it.
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:09:21

@_date: 2016-05-05 15:25:11

Hell no. This isn't about some magical journey to truth and enlightenment. This is about one man claiming multiple times to have proof that he is Satoshi, and multiple times producing doctored evidence. That's not some esoteric idea, it's fraud.

@_date: 2016-05-03 17:39:11
Agreed. I also believe that people VASTLY overestimate the amount of Bitcoin that under direct control of any entity, Satoshi or not. If you look at the mining trail from 2009-2011, there were at least 5-10 people mining from basically day-1 (Finney alone mined for weeks from block 70), so I think 'Satoshi' or a person in the 'Satoshi' group is unlikely to own more than 100k coin. It also speaks volumes that he will 'sign early coin' and not 'produce private key for Genesis' or even post with the verified Satoshi PGP that is available. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:18:35
Absolutely no rule to that, but I would argue that statistically you are correct. If you do trade, tight stoploss and fast fingers. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:53:28
There is no 'multiply by 10'. If you follow the discussion on how much Satoshi is likely to own it's far less than 800k coins, as low as 200k. And that's assuming that he still owns the keys for all the addresses he used. We have one person (since debunked) that theorized that Satoshi owned 1.1 million BTC, but it has been thoroughly disproved by among other's Maxwell. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:22:17
Decentralization in itself I guess is a bad way of describing it. Maybe 'lack of fundamentals' is a better word. There are no underlying earnings etc. Sure, if there is a huge announcement from the developers etc. that can push price, but that's a solvable problem. And once Bitcoin is 100% mainstream, there won't be any more 'Microsoft accepts Bitcoin' to surprise-pump.

One of the best thoughts on this entire saga so far. Even though it opens more doors than it closes it brings up something I find important.

He won't be. Even if he signs with the right private keys, I believe Dave Kleinman is Satoshi, and this douche just happen to know him well enough to get his hands on Dave's USB drive when he passed. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:29:58
This. We know the Satoshi PGP key exists and is verifiable, he should have keys to MANY blocks, and his records show he used not a single but many private keys party due to how the early client worked. There is absolutely no shortage of proof that the real Satoshi should be able to present. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:24:31
No kidding, that's some third rate Science fiction bullshit right there. The again, she's one of those 'geek girls' that hang around Bitcoiners to be invited to conferences and reap some minimal ecosystem fame, and eventually get to be 'office manager' at some bitcoin startup for $100k a year. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:56:54
Not really, Satoshi speaks to this in the mailing list. A soft fork would prob be needed but nothing drastic. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:20:27
What do you mean? He stole $19 from 3 people. Wright out!
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:53:32
I guess it's a definition issue. My point is just that in assets there is more of a 'insider factor' while bitcoin, without any underlying performance data is immune to such trading. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 17:35:52
Absolutely. Though based on the nonce and other factors I personally doubt Satoshi owns more than 400k coins. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:56:05
While I probably have to admit that you have a point, I will also argue that CW shows NONE of the characteristics that Satoshi showed on bitcointalk, crypto lists etc. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:27:37
No, I'm just saying that the forces that manipulate gold would not possibly exist in bitcon simply due to the low market cap. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:41:50
He can spend the additional Bitcoin that has been sent to the address corresponding to the private key. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:48:03
Source? Also, yeah. That sure seems like Satoshi, not move 100k+ BTC but play with 14 BTC on Gox.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:54:59
Bitcoin has removed the trust in humans, because we don't NEED to know who created Bitcoin for it to work. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 00:23:47
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:00:53
True, but between 2010-2015 there was at least 2+ years with no sign of insolvency or malicious intent. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:19:04
You can still make money by just trend trading. Nothing to do with the speed of your trade. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:33:32
Commodities, stocks, bonds and any other financial vehicle all have underlying factors that drive their value. Bitcoin, if a truly global currency will be close to immune to those type of value drivers. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:21:18
I think people are 'OK' with anyone being Satoshi. It's about not only the behavior of the person in this case but also on the skill level, demeanor and more. CW just doesn't fit any of the frames for who Satoshi is. His mnemonic is wrong, his knowledge doesn't seem to fit, his personality, and lastly the way he is going about proving it.
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:42:24
Total non news. Everyone in the Bitcoin ecosystem already gets a fuckload of spam, and hashed and salted passwords arent going anywhere. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:41:15
I remember a conversation where the listmaster of the Crypto mailing list also claimed that Satoshi had verified the key in private so I would argue that it's very good supporting evidence. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:34:32
This is what speaks to Dave Kleiman being Satoshi. On medication and bed-bound schedule matters far less than for a regular person. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:26:09
In the current environment it's entirely possible, but as the decentralized nature of Bitcoin develops those tendencies will disappear. And with no underlying earnings Bitcoin will likely move more independently than traditional assets. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:33:48
I personally think that Occam's Razor kills most government conspiracies. The crypto cat is out of the bag. Even if someone killed Bitcoin, it's only a matter of time until something new takes its place. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:52:44
No, not why not. Rather, why? Do you know anyone that owns $100 million+ worth of Apple shares that trades $1500 worth of pink sheet stocks? It's just not rational behavior. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:12:34
Oh absolutely, I hope he signs a block somewhere in the middle, like block 21 or so, and then shows a picture of himself with a screenshot of some source code. Then Dave Kleiman turns out to not be dead, and verified him.. but he turns out to be a body double.. or some shit
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:41:45
Oh, OK... so this will effect anyone? Nope.
@_date: 2016-05-05 02:19:32
Not really. The reason that HFT companies invest 100s of millions in microwave and satellite links is to gain the millisecond advantage. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:39:07
BTCmedia.net is a scam news site, and spondoolies-lech (url) is 100% scam. Report the reddit poster, and the website btcmedia.net
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:13:42
I disagree, but that's also OK.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:36:35
Sure, but enough circumstantial evidence could easily disprove it. Once people start digging into Craig's travel history, background etc. it won't be hard to prove that he was not the sender of the Satoshi emails or poster of the Bitcointalk posts. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:42:27
Absolutely, but my point is that it's disingenuous to blame someone for knowing Karpeles back in 2010, long before anyone had any reason to cast blame on him for anything. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:30:05
Well, high frequency trading isn't good either. Since there literally can be no hft without advantage over the remainder of the marker. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:33:12
Its not a 'bad' wallet. It's just a very basic one.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:05:05
Which takes the hilarity to new levels. Since apparently he now remembers a person at a conference with whom he had no contact after, and did not recognize in 2014, as Satoshi. Cause he 'got a closer look at his face'..
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:23:08
Shes insane. Claiming that someone 'hacked her' which had the effect that letters she was typing were disappearing is some "War Games" made up bs. Just an attention seeking geek girl. Move along, nothing to see here. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:58:36
Sure that's a valid theory, I still believe that Satoshi is not a single person based on a bunch of things. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:54:21
Not strange at all that he would remember a random person out of many hundred from 2005, only to forget him in 2014, and then remember again in 2016.. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:04:24
Good thing this is redddit, and it doesn't matter. I think he quite well understood my point. The fact that I misuse it later is for fun :)
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:47:46
Lots of us are. Good thing that statistically you won't take it personally. :)
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:48:58
How exceptionally opportune that you remembered now. Or, you know. 100% complete bullshit.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:10:55
Bought mine pre-2013. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:43:16
No. Just no. Also "thanks Obama" /s
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:15:39
Beg Bite
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:04:49
I considered an investment but it's way overvalued at this point. At around $10 million total I would have been in. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:52:42
But the Wallet project isn't an entity completely separate from the remaining Mycelium project is it?
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:24:17
Yes. If you start a cryptography project that involves a US agency I won't use is. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:04:45
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:03:18
So it's easier to throw your friends under the bus and go to jail than it is to move any amount of Bitcoin using a key you possess. OK, that's totally what I would have done. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:42:07
My grievance was never with the removed access, but the fact that it was seemingly removed as a knee jerk reaction to a stated opinion, by people who arguably has contributed less to Bitcoin thank Gavin. This is a well stated response, that lays out the reasoning well and I can definitely get behind the removal and non-reinstatement at this time. The only unfortunate part was that the removal came at the worst time possible for toinfoilhatting and not several months ago.
