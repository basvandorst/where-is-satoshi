This isn't particularly surprising. Buffet is pretty famous for disliking gold as an investment and Bitcoin is seen by many as "eGold" 
As others have said, on the one hand Buffet isn't the type to mouth off without getting a good understanding of the fundamentals. On the other he's both a value investor and not a technology person so he would be looking at bitcoin from the perspective of a productive asset, which it is not.
That being said, we should concede that he has a point that there is still a huge level of risk in bitcoin as a currency/asset **as opposed to the technology/protocol**.

Really? Who are you with?
I have accounts with HSBC and have explicitly declared purchases and intent to purchase bitcoins. 
Even when I pushed branch managers to check with their managers, they've always said there are no issues with it.

Really? Your counter-argument is to name-call and simple dismissal? 
Firstly, calling class warfare on Buffet is pretty freaking ridiculous - this is a guy who recognises the dangers of inequality and is both donating most of his wealth to charity AND started the Giving Pledge to sign rich people up to give most of their wealth away. He's also famous for his down-to-earth living.
Secondly, there are plenty of reasons why Buffet could be wrong, but being uninformed is unlikely to be one. In the context of the article he is more likely to be commenting about bitcoin as a gold-like asset or currency, which he is definitely qualified to talk about. 
Now I believe in bitcoin so I'm holding on to mine, but when Buffet says something like this you'd be stupid not to double-check your logic

Would you be able to expand on your reasoning please? 
I don't understand why the Gox price is a reflection of BTC without Chinese money:
* Given the lack of yuan trading on Gox I'm not sure there's a large Chinese investor sentiment factor there
* It's very hard to get fiat out of Gox, and also fairly hard to get foreign currency into China they are probably less likely to sell out of BTC to be able to withdraw, relative to others
I'm not refuting your logic: I'd like to know more as obviously do not want to be exposed to such a fall!

What's unclear to me is how much hes talking about bitcoin the technology vs. bitcoin the investment asset vs bitcoin the currency.
As a technology I think we all know its here to stay...but there's a million ways bitcoin itself could go down. On the one extreme it replaces all money, on the other extreme you could end up with walled gardens with their own altcoin as a payment protocol...who knows?

On the flip side, exchanges are natural monopolies due to scale / network effects, therefore relying on competitive pressure to improve quality may not work. Mt.Gox is a clear example - even after months (years?) of known problems they still had roughly 30% of the market.
Also it's really only **crony** capitalism if the licensing is cost-prohibitive to new entrants or not applied fairly. Otherwise it's just inefficient capitalism.

I don't like lobbyists any more than you do, but I think its a bit of a stretch to connect a $2500 donation with Manchin's statements given that JP Morgan donates to many congressmen. 
If we started seeing a pattern I'd start wondering. Otherwise it's far more likely that Manchin is just a luddite.
Edit: my mistake - it appears to be $30k in donations so it is certainly substantial, although they're pretty far down the list of donors vs. coal companies.

I would agree with your first point if mtgox was just running an inferior quality service, but in most competitive markets you wouldn't last over a year if you couldn't perform the basic function.
I sympathise with wariness of regulation, having tried and failed to set up a business in a regulated market. For something as systemic as an exchange I do think there is a valid debate on whether we should put up with fat cats if at least the system works - I hope you will concede its a complex issue regardless of which side you're on.
Hopefully p2p exchanges or another solution will make the whole discussion moot.

I wasn't saying I had good relationships with branch managers, I was just stating that no one at HSBC seemed to have an issue with bitcoin when raised specifically, either at the branch or at head office (or wherever they were) 
I agree its anecdotal and someone at compliance or elsewhere could suddenly shut down everything - but for now no one seems to have an issue

Thanks for the tip. If I don't get anything helpful I'll try another sub.

I understand the frustration with price, but isn't the whole point of a decentralised currency NOT to have leadership...?

Seeing the implementation here makes me worry about how bitcoin will take off as a payment system. It's really hard to see how this is helpful to me as a consumer, and "no refunds" is a huge red flag that most people are accustomed to take note of.
I get it's cheaper for Bigfish but there's no discount passed through to me. Sure there's more privacy with no payment details but the vast majority, myself included, really don't care about that.
I hope someone smarter (and with more time) than me can work out a model that helps the buyer side of the equation. Right now all Bitcoin benefits seem to accrue to the seller.
