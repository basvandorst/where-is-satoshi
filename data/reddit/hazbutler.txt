If you're asking Reddit, you probably shouldn't be involved in the first place...

Can add a cool $1m to that now...

What I wanna know is who has the BTC now...? Wheres their story. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:31:31
Reminds me of the Joe Kennedy story about the shoeshine boy. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:28
I had a similar dream, although I was trying to sell it and it wouldn't let me on to Coinbase. I had to go to this DMV type place, and well, you can imagine what that was like...
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:32:56
Ass idea? You know where to get it OP...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:39
This is all relative. Not nearly as many people knew what BTC was back then compared to now. I'm not talking about the money grabbers, I'm talking about the adopters of the tech etc etc. I can't say its not going to crash, but you have to have faith that its becoming the norm.

While most of you will compare 40 BTC in today's value, and think they overpaid for the car, consider that 40 BTC in 2010 was about $4 at one point.

For those wondering what futures are, just watch 'Trading Places' and concentrate on the last half hour. Its also a Christmas Movie!...kinda. Win win.

It said what a pussy would delete knowing they’d been called out as one. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:12:41
Sounds like you just described yourself. Have some respect, educate, or fuck off.

Late for your own wedding. Could mean you’re late for your funeral too.

I take your point, am fully aware that people have a lot of money, and I will reiterate the life lesson for you summed up by Isriam, below. Have a lovely day Steve.

Last years crack 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:55:04
Yeah, and I wish I had known the lottery numbers before they came out. People have been doing this for years, don't beat yourself up about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:33:29
I understand that people use sites for trading, but given what appears to be the hodl philosophy of most people on here, it baffles me that people would leave this sum anywhere but on a private wallet. I hope OP gets it back, but also learned a lesson.

"But I won't be able to afford my Christmas presents! sell sell sell!" 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:48
based on what? If he bought 1.

Someone is always on here to shake things up. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:22:24
I heard it was earlier, no?

Tony Hale has really hit rock bottom.

I'm up exactly 200% on my investment since March. Thats pretty insane. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:07:05
Is that some other weird cocktease thing you and your wife are into? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:01:11
I am now :) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:19
Dump! No buy! no Dump! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:48:50
Congrats man. My moon is to reach enough to get to a similar situation, debt free! I am almost there and in less than a year! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:07:08
Nothing to do with that. I'm simply saying that what other investment could you have made outside of crypto, would give you that kind of return in such little time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:20
You missed it
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:12
haha its bonkers 
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:24:43
That literally makes no sense. If you live a single day like its your last, then why would you be investing for the future...?
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:16:41
Thats Jeremy Paxman, he's always a douche, no matter the interviewee. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:19:49
Its all relative. If you dump all your money into something you plan to live off later, but can't afford to live right now, then you're an idiot. Do not invest more than you're able to lose. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:12:19
Good luck to you. I think people being flippant about the risk shouldn't invest at the promise of "being rich". But I agree, the kid is 16, he'll either pat himself on the back later, or as you mentioned, just do it all over again. I'm one of those hoping on the former...
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:38:48
Nope. I sold it for USD at 8K....then bought right back in.
