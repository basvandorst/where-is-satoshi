miners find blocks INDEPENDENTLY of each other. that means the number of blocks goes up like a [poisson process]( with mean time 10 mins.
if you work it out, probability of waiting for at least 28 mins for a block would be exp(-2.8) = 6%. not that remarkable.

two guys walk into a bar. the first guy says to the barman, "i bet you 2 bitcoins upfront that i can put a shot glass at one end of your bar and piss into it from the other end of your bar without spilling anything."
the barman says "you're completely crazy, but go for it."
so this guy pays him the 2 bitcoins and then he walks to the other end and manages to piss everywhere - there is piss all over the walls, all over the bar top, all over the floor, and all over the barman. in fact he manages to completely miss the shot glass.
the barman starts laughing hysterically, but so does the guy who just pissed everywhere.
"what are you laughing at!? you just lost 2 bitcoins!" says the barman.
"well you see that other guy in the corner?" he says, pointing to the other guy whom he entered the bar with. "before we walked in, i bet him 10 bitcoins that i could piss all over the floor and walls and counter of your bar AND you, and you'd find it really funny!"

not an answer, but i was wondering this too... on btc-e you can trade in £ and $ and their $/£ exchange rates are always in the 1.58-1.62 range as opposed to the current exchange rate of 1.68, making it more costly to buy in £

blocks aren't found exactly every 10 minutes. blocks are found whenever someone happens to find one, which averages out to every 10 minutes. it's a [poisson process]( the chances of no block being found in 30 minutes is exp(-3)=5.0%. once i had to wait 46 minutes for a single confirmation

i found these in the faq:
(1) "If no one is willing to take the other site": site --&gt; side
(2) "How are winnnings calculated?": winnnings --&gt; winnings
(3) "So your will be credited with 25,000 - 300 = 24,700 credits.": your --&gt; you
looking at the top blog post:
(4) "I’ll give you 7 good reason to do so:": reason --&gt; reasons
(5) "In many counties you may have to deal with customs": counties --&gt; countries (this makes more sense to me, but counties could be right)
still looking for spelling mistakes, will edit post if i find a few more. 1QBwH21Hzw2R4yWkgHJAo9kNQAvNdQHzPw

**I'VE GOT IT**
It's a significant figures issue.
The default setting on bitcoinity is to show latest trade prices to 4 significant figures, which can be changed under preferences. On bitstamp you can specify your price up to the nearest cent, which at the current price would be 5 significant figures.
Bitcoinity, unlike (say) bitcoinwisdom, will group together latest trades in the history under the same price, so no 2 consecutive trades in the history will appear as the same price. What constitutes the same will be determined by how many significant figures you set your preferences to on the site. Don't believe me? See for yourself - change the number of significant figures you see to 3, then to 5, and you'll see that large orders will be split into smaller numbers. The green and red arrows only indicate movement in the last trade price, not buys/sells.
What is going on here is that, since bitstamp allows you to set prices to 5 significant figures, you get a lot of people buying at 300.00 and selling at 299.99. These are reported on bitcoinity (set to 4 sig fig) all at the same price, so all orders within that time period are grouped together and listed as 300.0 which you see on that screenshot. Furthermore, the trade before it of 0.1 at 299.4 was 29 minutes before, which means that the 11362.58 is just the total of all sells made at 299.99 and buys at 300.00 in those 29 minutes. And finally, the video clearly shows that there were long periods of time where the only trades were made at those two prices. Bingo.

so let's say you're in the jungle and you're playing poker with a tiger, a hippopotamus, a hedgehog, a kangaroo, and a potato. you have a pair of nines, and the flop is j84 all different suits. the tiger's tail is thrashing round violently but it seems to be completely unaware that it's doing it, like an involuntary action. it checks. the hippopotamus looks bored and immediately checks. the hedgehog grins at the tiger and does not look scared of it at all and bets half the pot. the kangaroo jumps around excitedly but calms down and folds. the potato immediately goes all-in for slightly more than the pot. do you fold, call, raise, or run screaming?

no he couldn't, because the way these dice sites work is that they impose a maximum profit amount on each bet. in the screenie you can see that the maximum profit amount is 247.47 bitcoins meaning that he is only allowed to win that amount of bitcoins on each roll, forcing him to draw out the process like this if he wants to run it up. all the numbers in the profit column are at least reasonably close to that number

are you using multibit classic or multibit hd. classic can be buggy sometimes with transactions not confirming properly on the wallet. try doing this: [reset blockchain and transactions]( usually solves any problems i have with it
if you're using hd, don't know, there might be something similar but i haven't checked because i don't use hd. rest assured, however, that you definitely have the bitcoins if they're showing up on blockchain.info. it's only a question of making them show up properly in your wallet

i think it's because today's a bank holiday in europe. no fiat will have entered bitstamp or other european exchanges since friday, and all bank transfers sent over the weekend will typically arrive on bitstamp all at once at 9am or so the next working day (tuesday), and we might see a spike on bitstamp around then. i remember seeing this happen once before

judging from your use of £ and EMA i assume you are in the UK (didn't EMA stop existing in 2012?)
for what it's worth, here is a personal experience of mine: i walked into my local santander branch and asked them if they would care about having unknown bank transfers going into my account (basically same situation as you, except i'm looking to sell, not buy) and once i mentioned bitcoin, the clerk straight up told me: listen, if you want to move money in and out of your account through bitcoin, **don't use santander. get another account with barclays or RBS instead** and use that.
it depends on your bank i guess. it's annoying but what might happen is your account could be blocked by a computer system until you tell them where the money is coming from or going to. it's annoying to sort out when that happens. they don't like bitcoin, but they shouldn't shut down your account for using bitcoin in small amounts like that

each contract is 1 dollar but on bitmex you can put up more than what you have, because of leverage. this guy says his entry price was in the 3k-4k range with liquidation just above 6k so he would have shorted with between 2x and 3x leverage, meaning he lost between 40k and 60k
