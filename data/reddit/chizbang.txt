You dont need anything to hide to have the right to privacy, just like you __dont__ want a lock on your door because you're __not__ running some sort of illegal drug operation in your basement.
For example, you wouldnt hand over _all_ your web browsing history to me (and I mean __all__) because you have nothing to hide. Thats like handing a key of your house to some stranger to demonstrate that you have nothing to hide.
And sure, even if you have nothing to hide right now, whos to say that- that wont change 5 or 10 years down the line? What if your current political views (or anything really) have life threatening consequences to you in the future if some rouge leader rises to power?
Plus, if some hacker manages to break into their servers (unlikely, but could still happen) and decides to release all the collected information, this could have social ramifications for you as well if your private messages were among the released data. (which could easily be the case)

Cant sell for Bitcoins mind you, but still a step in the right direction!

Just use common sense when downloading something....
So long as you dont download something because an ad banner told you to, you should be good if your sensible.

I was stupid enough to buy a code when they were "out of stock" (I found out later that this was not the case)
So I emailed him and asked for some help and about 10 minutes later he came back with a email explaining the situation and he said hed send me the codes when he was finished doing somehting. Surely enough, an hour later after the payment was confirmed and he emailed me back with the code. He takes good guy to the extreme. Awesome guy, awesome business. What more can I say? A+++ This business is gonna go far. Thanks very much for all the support!

Umm.. A friend sent me a link to the steam20 page and I had never visted the site before hand and it said at the time it had 1 left in stock so I acted swiftly and sent a payment. I then went to the home page and realised it said it was out of stock. What will happen to my Bitcoin? I have emailed you
