You can make a lot of bitcoins mining with that setup, however not by mining Bitcoin. Your best bet is to mine alternative coins then sell those alt coins for actual bitcoins.

Right now Bitcoin is just a commodity because it is not spent enough daily enough for it to be a currency
@_date: 2016-08-11 21:57:41
It's in both our interests, mine for obvious reasons and yours because we all know the direction Bitcoin is going in (disregarding the daily ups and downs).

How do you calculate risk of loss for this equation?
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:45:40
Everyone needs to spend bitcoins in order for it to become a proper currency, otherwise it's just a commodity. Only when bitcoins are being spent more and more, the value of bitcoins will rise (excluding short term peaks and troughs).

The dollar value amount and how much btc you send makes no difference to the fee. Have a look at the mempool and make a decision on what the fee should be based on how long you want the transaction to take. Then set your fees in electrum to fixed/manual (just not dynamic) and boom.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:22:01
Okay perfect. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:30:43
Cheers for the heads up bud!

How much can you make with with it? Roughly 
@_date: 2016-06-25 21:21:52
This actually makes so much sense, I applaud you
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:50:30
Oh, my bad.

"When's the best time to plant a tree? 30 years ago. When's the second best time to plant a tree? Today." I guess this logic could be applied here with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 08:37:06
Don't mean to be a dick but it's most probably not worth it, you need ASIC miners nowadays for you to even cover your electricity costs. The CPU/GPU in even the best PCs right now aren't really the best way... if you want to mine, look up ASIC miners
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:32:28
Thank you, I'll be looking into these further

Can HYIP programs disappear at any time or do they generally stay for at least an X amount of time?

You can use coinbase, they have an official app. I've used coinbase to buy Bitcoins and so far it's been smooth sailing
@_date: 2016-06-25 21:15:34
I buy through coinbase, purchases are instant and sending is done within 20 minutes 
@_date: 2016-06-26 01:46:49
It's not that deep. It's just a metaphor, don't cry
@_date: 2016-06-26 09:18:34
That's a good way to think about it. I do believe others will begin to invest in Bitcoin, and I can see it being implemented into everyday payments. In the UK (sorry I don't know where you're from), Subway have already begun accepting Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-06-25 08:40:02
Many other countries in Europe are also thinking about leaving the EU (Frexit, Grexit etc)... who knows, if they all fuck up the base then maybe they'll all adopt bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-06-26 01:43:53
Yeah don't leave them in the coinbase wallet for sure. I use electrum 
@_date: 2016-06-25 08:53:59
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:03:42
Lol what's with the down votes? I'm being realistic

If you don't want to buy or work for any then keep using faucets till you get 200000 satoshis, then invest it in margin trading or lending (depends on how confident you are as to making a profit trading)
@_date: 2016-11-20 14:08:25
Sounds perfect, if you want someone to proof read it lemme know, I like this sort of stuff
@_date: 2016-11-03 11:14:01
If you do, invest because you believe in Bitcoin and have it in your mind that you don't want to invest to acquire more fiat but to get ahead and acquire cheap Bitcoin before more people start to adopt it

@_date: 2016-09-04 15:45:29
Because a previous high is a resistance level, once it's broken through it is more likely to turn that resistance level into a support level which means a newer, higher resistance level could be formed... But if the resistance is too strong the price could drop, however momentum is a big indicator.
@_date: 2016-09-04 15:40:07
Sure you can Hodl, but also ensure you spend some bitcoins too, that is ultimately what will turn Bitcoin into a thing that more than 1% of the population use. But also keep hodling at the same time!
Have fun!
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:40:17
You buy Bitcoin, if the value increases you've made fiat profit, if it goes down you've made a fiat loss. However Bitcoin is a CURRENCY, so you want to be using it to actually purchase things in your every day life, that's what'll drive Bitcoins value
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:44:14
Noo that defeats the point of Bitcoin being a currency, if everyone did that Bitcoins' value would be 0 in no time
@_date: 2016-10-31 23:44:02
we don't need 100% adoption
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:01:19

@_date: 2016-10-30 00:36:48
Not bad at all!
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:34:03
Honestly, it's not worth it unless you have a warehouse full of miners... and I literally mean a warehouse full of them

High fees, lots of random lost bitcoin problems... I used to use them, not anymore
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:36:36
It just makes sense.
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:38:11
I do hope so, history never repeats itself but it sure does rhyme... 
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:15:23
Well... that depends on how long you were gone for 
@_date: 2016-10-23 10:57:59
I didn't even know Expedia accepted Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:32:49
Nope I've not experienced any problems 
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:22:44
Use Circle or Bitstamp
@_date: 2016-10-29 14:31:18
You're right it could, but there is so much more potential to Bitcoin that $700 doesn't do it justice 
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:24:20
Ketchup or BBQ?
@_date: 2016-10-29 18:14:31
I don't get it, what do you mean?
@_date: 2016-10-29 10:40:05
I know lots of people that get paid in Bitcoin and only pay for things with Bitcoin, that's the real way to get more than 1% of the population to adopt Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-10-29 10:56:12
Well no, you're wrong
@_date: 2016-10-23 10:59:51
I wouldn't bother with coinbase 
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:42:54
Try Bitstamp, I think their limits are higher
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:45:26
Use lots of different exchanges instead of using just one for a large amount of BTC
@_date: 2016-10-23 10:58:41
Based on what proof?
@_date: 2016-10-29 10:40:27
Just do the opposite 
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:41:41
Ahh, I thought the price would have kept going up indefinitely, fuck sake
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:36:23
Only 50% evil, 100% evil would have been $666.666

Whether you buy now or use cost price averaging it doesn't really matter because even a few months is relatively short term when you think about the potential for Bitcoin in the next 5 or 10 years 
@_date: 2016-10-23 11:00:52
I think this is definitely a good sign for Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:40:58
Coinbase... lol
@_date: 2016-10-29 19:49:28
Amen 
@_date: 2016-10-29 10:40:54
Buy again, and see where you'll be in another 3 months, then a year...
@_date: 2016-07-19 00:38:15
We both know Bitcoin will always have a place based on that

Just to make sure I understood what you said, I do research then mine a specific coin in a specific pool for that coin and sell it for Bitcoin on an exchange?

This is a perfect example of why I love Reddit. OP didn't know something fairly basic and asked a question, however instead of everyone putting him/her down for not knowing, they gave very good answers in the spirit of helping each other. I think the future can be a very bright place...especially with Bitcoin!
