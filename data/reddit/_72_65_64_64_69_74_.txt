According to you. I believe that I am a sovereign person, and you have no authority to rule over me.


I disagree. Governments slow or destroy progress in nearly everything they do.


You know what's not a productive use of my time? Working to pay for the government for four months a year when I want none of what it offers.

Not really, because if any competing crypto develops a killer feature, it could be added to bitcoin.

Why should the burden be on me to leave?


I'd wager that most (non-violent) anarchists believe that voting and/or being a part of the government is inherently violent and unethical.

I think the most important thing about bitcoin, especially for those who don't mind the government and central banks having significant control over the economy, is that it forces the gov/banks to control their costs and compliance burdens in order to compete with bitcoin: If I can move $10 million worth of value across international boundaries in 10 minutes with bitcoin, but moving the same amount of value in USD or Euro or whatever is going to take 10 days and $10,000, I'm going to choose bitcoin until the gov/banks make it easier, faster, and cheaper.
Bitcoin is a fairly elegant solution to extraordinarily complex problem, and it is still very young. It is not yet ready for the mainstream because it doesn't have the really big money behind it, developing ways to make it safer and easier to use and marketing it to consumers. It doesn't have the really big money behind it because it's hard to make money with something open source like bitcoin, and it challenges a lot of what normal is so they don't know what to do with it.

Not likely. I believe what I believe because I've spent a lot of time reading about it and discussing it with people on and offline. If I can't base my beliefs on evidence or logical argument, I keep quiet.

I find it rather annoying that I have to keep up with the constant changes in order to remain compliant.

If they abuse the fee rates, however, there's greater incentive for someone else with a lot of money to get into enterprise-scale mining operations. And with bitcoin, there aren't any contracts that can limit you to only using certain miners.

If Wal-mart wants me as a customer, they'd better figure out a way to let people get there. If a home-builder wants to sell me a house, they'd better figure out a way for me to easily and conveniently get to and from the property.
Government provided roads are terrifically inefficient. They cost vast amounts of money to build and maintain, and the technology has not significantly improved in at least 50 years.


Do you think a bank would give me a mortgage, or an insurance company a policy, if I had no fire protection service? It would cost them money if my house burned down, so they're not going to help me pay for it without that protection in place.


Homogeneity severely hampers innovation. You can't figure out what is the best way to educate if everybody's doing the same thing, teaching the same curricula, and using the same tests. A competitive education market would result in a far better product for far more people. Standardization also adds a lot of politics to education.


Even if government agencies performed at "100%", I still don't want them doing what they're doing.


Government creates all sorts of monopolies. In a free market, monopolies can't endure very long unless they are truly able to outperform all competitors for a long time. If there is a local monopoly that is overcharging consumers, other investors will see the potential profits and work to undercut the monopoly, or people will find other ways to avoid it.


That's obviously not the only thing wrong with government or taxes. [Regulatory capture]( is another huge problem. And then there are the hundreds of millions of lives lost to wars, [democide]( and even things like the FDA bottleneck on new drug approvals.

Taxes are the forced collection of wealth from someone, often against their wishes, and often used to pay for things which are unethical and/or against their wishes or religious beliefs.
When money can be confiscated by the government, people start to look for ways to use the government to either gain that money for themselves ("[rent seeking]( or to protect themselves against other people doing it ("rent avoidance"). This behavior is economically inefficient and it leads to continuous government growth: the stronger the government, the more important it is to control the government, so the more money people throw at it, rinse, repeat. This continued government growth tends to result in highly authoritarian societies, which in my view is uncivilized.
To me, a civilized society is one where individuals have incentives to improve their own lives in such a way that improves the lives of others as a side effect. This requires a strong respect for individual liberties and little to no government.
