Nobody is using segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:26:31
Wait, so where was the problem? Was it the actual withdrawal to your bank from Coinbase/other or was it during the loan process and explaining where you got the money? Who thinks you are a terrorist/drug dealer, the loan people or the ppl processing the deposit?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:53
This is why I don't even tell people that I'm invested in crypto. People aren't going to try to rub it in my face when it's down and they won't try to ask me for money when it's up. Win win.

I was just going to ask when this was. It reads like it was written last week.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:39:26
Comparing bitcoin transfers to crusty old and outdated wire transfers lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:07:17
After you send it to an exchange you'll probably only have $20 left lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:51:56
They are moving in that direction.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:21:17
Lol like that's anywhere near the same thing as when bitcoin goes through it's massive swings. Get real. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:30:17
They explicitly show you the fees your paying. Did you not see that before you agreed to give them your money?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:23:43
I've read about a lot of people having problems with their services, I guess there are a lot of inconsistencies and errors on their part when calculating the values. I haven't actually used them though. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:07:29
Lmao, you can't trust someone because they make a business decisions that isn't aligned with your personal views? Boo hoo.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:53:13
No. Even if you don't lock your doors it's not your fault if you get robbed. Did you pull this logic out of your ass?
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:01:27
Boo hoo. Coinbase works perfectly fine for 95% of it's users. Keep reaching though.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:43:29
They are. SIA is developing their own ASIC for sia coin and Decred. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:39:02
Coinbase doesn't have anything to do with bitcoins outrageous fees. They do charge a lot but that's just on top of what's already really high. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:39:52
Sure, lets check with the auditors...Ohhhh.....

Sure thing buddy �� Whatever makes u feel better.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:33:27
This is exactly why Coinbase is so popular and a top app in iTunes and why Coinbase isn't going anywhere. All of the whiney bitches on here who are boycotting them are just making their backend faster and relieving their support staff so the normies can sign up and buy faster. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:22:15
Wait, so did Coinbase actually screw you or do anything to you personally to make you leave? Or are you leaving because their opinions and business decisions are different than yours? 
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:24:40
Lmao someones salty that bought high!!

Hahaha North Korea. The delusion is strong with this one. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:25:33
The difference is that instead of getting paid on Friday he'll probably get his paycheck on Tuesday(after the transaction confirms) and his employer will probably deduct a $100 fee for sending it :'‑)

Keep getting cucked.

Only noobs use Blockfolio. It's missing a lot of coins also. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:22:53
Lol. The only person to blame is OP, he screwed up. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:38
So pay $20 to wire money and then pay another $20 dollars to transfer the bitcoin? Ya'll buggin

I'm in Seattle, want me to go find them for you? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:56:52
I know it was but I think Delta is going to over throw it. I liked Blockfolio but there was a stretch there where it just wouldn't work and prices wouldn't update. Even now there are a lot of coins that it doesn't even have. The main feature I'm looking forward to with Delta is that you can back up and sync data across multiple devices, coming Jan 3.

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:37:23
THIS. Bitcoin holders think that they will keep winning and winning and winning and winning, 100% of the time. 'Buy the dip. Hold! This is just a correction!' You can win a hundred times but the first time you lose you're done. Eventually they are going to lose and people are going to get burned hard becuase everybody thought they were invincible. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:04:10
Yeah if your holding. If Venezuelans converted over to Bitcoin to transact with they would be getting totally wrecked.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:43:33
The obsession with crypto that will soon follow is a different form of unhealthy. Better than smoking though. Get ready!
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:44:52
That doesn't explain why Bitcoin fees were substantially less earlier this year, when the volume of transactions were similar to now.

If you're actually taking 10k positions you won't be on the tier paying half a percent.
It's $35 anyways on ONE single 10k trade.
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:09:05
Half a percent on your measly $300  trades is nothing. Most people here are bitching for no good reason.

["After the 2x hard fork was called off, BCH is now being seen as a favourite to one day replace BTC. If the Bitcoin community doesn't come to a consensus about how to scale the network soon, it may run into congestion, in which case people will need an alternative."](

The other times Bitcoin didn't have a legit competitor - now they do.

Wait till January and they will allow withdrawals then. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:03:03
They either withdraw it to their bank account using an exchange or they sell it locally (localbitcoins.com) both of which are taxable events so be sure to save some of that for the tax man.

How the fuck is Bitcoin supposed to be mainstream adopted as a legit investment, taking in institutional money, if it crashes and 'dies' like this every year....?
@_date: 2019-01-24 02:33:43
Or probably because Chinese New year is coming. They want to wait till after. And then wait till after Valentine's day. Oh and then wait for wall street bonuses and tax payments to come thru before resubmitting. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:33:32
I meant every year for the past ten years lol. Bitcoin lovers love to brag about how many times it has 'died' and then risen from the ashes.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:46:15
It could keep going down though and then stabilize at some point and just remain at that point forever, as other better, faster, cheaper coins pass them by. At this point that's what I feel like will happen but who knows. Should be an interesting 2018. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:15:08
Who are you to come in here with that sort of logic?!
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:57:49
I highly doubt that is happening. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 08:39:19
I'm saying I enable 2FA on everything. Plus all coins are in cold storage. Basic stuff.

I'm up so much more off my alts than I am BTC lol but keep thinking that. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:12:48
Because if you know how to trade then the odds are in your favor, not against you. I'm not down with throwing money away if I have an edge. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 04:51:41
Why are you guys so obsessed with BCH? Talking about them all the time just brings more attention to the project you are low key shilling it and you don't even know. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 09:11:30
Lol I never said I put 2fa on coins, I just mentioned using 2fa to secure all accounts, email...exchanges...etc. I guess u can say my trading stack on 1 exchange is secure with 2fa that's not tied to my phone number so that's 1 way, everything else is on a ledger. There are some wallets though that have 2fa (Electrum). 
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:59:06
Horrible analogy. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:02:34
Then make fun of the president in the proper context. I don't like the fucker either but this is a bitcoin subreddit where people are discussing crypto. Stop acting like a lil bitch all the time and always throwing Trumps name into everything. Deal with your emotions somewhere else.

When something is consistently losing 50-90% of it's value, to me that's a bad sign and not something I'd want to 'invest' in. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:05:07


Guys. This behavior is not sustainable. There's going to be a time when you won't keep winning and bitcoin doesn't go up, and stays down or keeps moving down. Bitcoin is not bulletproof and invincible. It's straight up delusional to think otherwise.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:21:23
Don't even waste your time. Nobody in here will listen. They think they are invincible and that bitcoin can crash and burn every 6 months only to keep going up. A lot of these dudes are living in fantasy land. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:31:08
One of these days it's going to crash and not come back up. It's. Stupid to think you are invincible. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:17:10
Bitcoin maximalist retards will always be calling it a 'correction' and a 'dip'. There's no point in even tryign to talk any sort of sense into them.

Did you bother reading the comment that he was replying to? He was talking about Trump. 




@_date: 2018-02-06 08:30:52

Are they really? Or are there servers just in Tokyo? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:10:27
Holding is a meme. Selling at the bottom is worse though but if something is tanking you should cut your losses and then re-enter once the chart looks like it's stabilizing. If you feel strongly about BTC then it's an easy way to increase your position without adding more fiat. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:09:00
Buying the dip is a meme. Most people who say they are buying the dip are bullshitting.

Why do people always bring up Trump? Just shut up, please.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:58:54
This is why veterans will tell you to keep reserve funds immediately available for crashes, so you can buy the dip. When shit goes south the exchanges buckle so you want to have money waiting. Plus, nobody in a rush will use a bank transfer with Coinbase. It always takes forever and a day.
