It seems to me that bitcoin as a unit of value and the blockchain are inseparable. Saying you can use blockchain technology without bitcoin is sort of like saying you can use stock market technology without listed companies.

Bringing solutions like proof of solvency and multi-sig escrow to market and making sure they are properly understood in the regulatory community is exactly the right approach, IMHO.

I think the best way to view bitcoin is as a technology platform. Platforms aren't really that interesting from a business or consumer standpoint when you only have ~5mm users (most not daily or even monthly actives), where bitcoin is at today. Email, wireless communications, social networking all get much more useful and interesting once there are 50mm or 500mm active users.
Getting the next 50mm people actively using the bitcoin network seems pretty critical over the next couple of years.

I agree that we are all in this together. Our primary focus is on bitcoin and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation of the bitcoin protocol, but helping with the development of alternative crypto-currencies is both technically within the scope of our charter and something that benefits us all. That applies to the bitcoin 2.0 projects as well.

Sounds like a good idea. Not sure the Foundation would best suited to take it on though. Maybe it's something that BitPay, BitNet, GoCoin, Coinbase, etc. would be able to rally around.
Certainly we'd love to support that type of initiative.
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:18:03
I've found that bitcoin plays well with both political parties in US. Sometimes for different reasons. For us the strategy is to be a resource on the technical rules that govern bitcoin and the social contract that allows the bitcoin network to regulate itself. We can be that resource for politicians or other groups and associations doing work on the ground.
For a lot of the traditional financial companies (banks and other investors on Wall Street), regulation is seen as validation. Whether you agree with that or not, some level of appropriate regulation will bring in new participants to the bitcoin ecosystem and seems inevitable.
Keeping that regulation sane and focused on actual risks is important.

This is probably a better question for Jim Harper. I think two of the biggest factors at play are:
- rate of adoption in a given country (i.e. do they need to care)

We have quite a bit of expertise that can be helpful for organizations working in DC and the regulatory community as they try to learn and understand how bitcoin works and the opportunities it provides. That's not unique to the Bitcoin Foundation. The Linux Foundation, Tor Project, etc. all have some legal initiatives to protect the free and open use of those systems. To the extent we can leverage that expertise to generate revenue (maybe a conference in DC for example), all the better.


Our OPEX fluctuates from month to month but most of our spending is, unsurprisingly, on headcount.
You mention proof of reserve, which is an interesting concept. But, proof of reserve is a technique for exchanges who have custody of consumer funds to prove their solvency (ie that if I put 100 btc into a Kraken account I know they still have 100 btc available for me to withdraw). We don't hold money in custody for anyone so proof of reserve, strictly speaking, isn't applicable.
Having said that, if there are ways to be more transparent in our finances using the blockchain whereby we aren't violating our members privacy then I'm certainly open to that. My understanding is that we've investigated the possibility and it isn't possible to strike that balance in an appropriate way right now.
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:03:53
Question 1: I guess we just disagree on that point.
Question 2: I think decentralized systems are good but distributed systems are better.

The Foundation operates as a distributed team. We don't really have any offices (except in London). We have team members in the UK, Europe, and the US and one team member who could be anywhere (I think Mexico right now).

I don't think you read my answer. My aim is to refocus the Foundation on where we can add the most value. If it's "being funneled in from a $4.6M bitcoin parachute" that would belie the definition of sustainability, no?

I laid out a more focused mission for the Foundation here:  that was inspired by Gavin's original post here:

User-defined privacy on the bitcoin network is important for a number of reasons, not least of which is the radical transparency that open-ledger systems require to operate.
What I don't support is touting things as anonymous when they really aren't. That seems reckless and will simply lead to people doing stupid things that they will later regret. True anonymity in an online digital environment is rarified air that few can attain and fewer still can maintain for long. I'm not convinced that it's a solvable problem but people should and will try to solve it.
I like to focus on privacy and how we can give people more choices in how they manage their own identities and their personal data. Anything that gives people more choices around privacy on the bitcoin network I'm in favor of.

I'm happy to support those companies, or others, if they want to create an initiative like this. I agree that a well done promotional campaign could be effective in driving awareness and adoption. I'm not convinced this is something the Foundation is best suited to lead on at the moment.
Maybe we could crowdfund for a Bitcoin Foundation Marketing Fellowship to help drive this?

Workshops and training for lawyers and other professionals is interesting. There's a company called the Digital Currency Council (maybe more) that is doing some  things along these lines (including certifications). When possible I'd rather partner with someone like that and help support others in the community.
I'm hesitant to get into consulting, that seems like we'd be stepping on our member's toes. Again, maybe if there was an interesting partnership approach where we can support others and add value.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:04:29
My top three priorities are:
- Refocus the Foundation around technical standards and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation of bitcoin. This includes developing a more formal technical standards approach to bitcoin development.
- Creating a better member experience for our supporters. Being more transparent in what we do and engaging in a dialog about our priorities.
- Developing a sustainable business model so that bitcoin's development isn't at the mercy of bitcoin price swings. This should also help align the Foundation's future with the value it is providing to the community.

I agree that the one of the biggest near-term opportunities to increase usage of bitcoin is through consumer adoption outside of the US, that is where the payment and banking system is most broken.

I also think we need to build out our membership benefits so people can see the value in becoming part of the Foundation beyond just charitable intent.
Open to feedback and suggestions?
@_date: 2014-11-07 05:48:09
Right now the best reason to sign up is because you support the mission of the Foundation and you want to help fund development of the Bitcoin Core reference implementation. We are working on developing some more tangible benefits for our members. Some ideas that we've kicked around are conference discounts, sponsorship opportunities and exclusive access to trainings.
Is there something specific you'd like to see?

Soon, hopefully by the end of the week. But at a higher level I don't think the grant program is something that we've done a particularly good job managing.
We need to evaluate how the grant program is managed and whether we are accomplishing our goals by administering it. Doing a grant program right takes a lot of time and resources and focuses attention on projects instead of the people doing the work.
I'm partial to dropping the grant program entirely and replacing it with a Fellowship model where we just fund a person who is doing great work in the community. 
What do you think?
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:29:48
Most people I speak with agree that bitcoin as a community needs a few things: 
1) a more formal approach to technical standards, 
2) policy and advocacy work, 
3) promotion and evangelism of bitcoin's benefits, and 
4) some sort of self regulatory body (for things that code can't regulate, yet).
When we started the Foundation we didn't define ourselves clearly as any one of those things and so people expected us to do all of it. Now that there are other groups and initiatives stepping up to fill in some of these needs, we have an opportunity to focus our approach, in particular on 
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:52:49
We have had plenty of discussions with State regulators and they are watching how things unfold in New York. That doesn't mean they are interested in following New York's approach per se, but the "bitlicense" proposal has garnered a lot of attention both here and abroad.
What State regulators seem most concerned with is consumer protection and what happens if the citizens they are charged to protect lose their life savings in a bitcoin exchange meltdown. I think they would love to hear constructive thoughts on how they can do their job without getting in the way.
But if you do reach out to your State regulator keep this in mind. As you pitch this cool new technology (or your business), you will tend to highlight all the ways that technology is different from everything out there in the market. When a regulator hears that something is "different" they think about how much work it's going to take them and their staff to understand how to deal with it. It's usually better to tell your friendly regulator all the ways that this new technology (or your business) is the same as something they already know how to deal with. That puts things in a useful context for them and let's you focus on the consumer benefits.

Hi Francis, nice to hear from you.
To answer your questions:


Supporting standardization through the Bitcoin Core reference implementation of bitcoin and providing better avenues for new people to build out core infrastructure.


I think a fellowship program and developer workshops would go long way. Also shifting our website to more of a resource hub for alternative implementations, open source libraries, etc. Shall we do a workshop in Montreal?


We need to do a better job of creating value for our members and providing outreach to the community. When we do those things well I'm sure our membership numbers will go up and correspondingly our revenue. Some ideas for additional revenue streams are software certifications, the developer workshops and trainings (maybe webinars) and sponsorships from our existing corporate members.


No. Much like the grant program, doing the the affiliate chapter program right is a project that requires a serious commitment of resources from the Foundation not the least of which is creating an effective marketing and sales process that our chapters can leverage for their local community. It's a priority for us to engage in a conversation with our local affiliates to chart a better course forward.


Don't know, probably both since the two reinforce each other.


Very positive. The first killer app for the blockchain is money and payments. More apps will bring more people to the network and benefit everyone in the community. This is particularly true with the advent of sidechains.


Yes. I read Adam's first proposal and knew this was a game-changer for bitcoin.
Thank you for the questions I tried to get to most of them!
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:39:52
I think the sidechains idea is a huge step forward for bitcoin and all the open-ledger systems because it enables solutions to some of the thorniest problems in bitcoin's technical evolution like scalability, performance, incentive structures, etc. Also, it will enable a raft of new innovation around "bitcoin 2.0" systems that can benefit from the security of the bitcoin blockchain and collateralization with bitcoin underlying.

When we started the Foundation we wanted to make sure that we could go fast and build something, that meant appointing an initial Board largely from the founders. We also created a membership class called Founding Members that controlled one of the (then 5) board seats. Everyone had a two year term. In hindsight a two year term was probably too long and we would have been well served by moving to a fully elected board sooner rather than later.
However, the Board has amended the by-laws to remove the Founding Member's board seat and all the appointed board member terms are expiring at the end of this year. It took longer than it should have, but the Foundation will have a fully elected board with no founder influence in just a couple months.

"Mr. Murck, can you explain how the Bitcoin Foundation has created more value for Bitcoin instead of all the donations used to bootstrap your organization going straight to developers" (FYI 2Years and $4-$9M dollars)
I wish we had $4-9mm to work with! You can see our spending as reported on IRS form 990 (found here:  and we'll be putting out a more detailed annual report at the end of the year. As far as financial transparency goes, that's a start but not the finish line.
"Mr. Murck, can you explain why your organization is burning through $150,000 a month?" (From their meeting minutes)
Because we are supporting many initiatives at one time. We want to get more focused though so I imagine in the short term that number will go down. However, I don't have a problem with spending $150,000 a month or any other amount as long as it's sustainable and more of it is channeled to the people building out bitcoin infrastructure. We're working on that.
"Mr. Murck, do you expect us to respect and take seriously your organization as leaders when so many of the people who make up your organization are lobbyists" (Look them up)
AFAIK only one person is a former lobbyist.
"Mr. Murck, why does your organization choose to engage government when it could be spending it's resources on the community directly."
That seems like a false choice. Why can't we do both? Aren't we more effective at each because we do both?
"Mr. Murck, will you please give the donated bitcoins back to the community and dismantle the foundation?"
That's not on the current roadmap:

Gavin is badly underpaid. His market salary would be a multiple of what he makes at the Foundation.

Well Gavin's salary (and mine) was pegged at $150k USD for most of 2014 (I was only a FTE for part of the year) and $125k USD currently. Gavin is not your typical senior developer, and would command a huge premium in the open market.
I also think you are overly focused on cash salary instead of total comp, cash + equity. There is no equity participation in a non-profit so the cash should be higher to make up the difference.

This was not "a January" election. I get that someone wrote one time in a blog post that there would be an election in January. Someone made a simple mistake in a blog post and you are pretending that it was somehow a requirement. You should also really stop complaining that a group of volunteers didn't run an election "smoothly" enough for you.
Being a critic is easy, doing things is hard. I appreciate the work everyone at the Foundation has put into making this election happen with almost zero resources. If anything we probably should have had the election in March to give those folks more time to "smooth" things out.
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:59:20
To be clear the election was not "supposed to happen in January". That's not an accurate statement nor is it accurate to say that it was handled "lackadaisically". That's not fair or respectful to the people who volunteer their time to make our elections happen.
I agree that asking Individual Members to register to vote is not uncommon. Of course, we can always do more to try and encourage people to register and vote. Dealing with voter apathy is not something that's unique to Foundation elections.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:41:03
Or in this case operating with clairvoyance since one of the seats in this election belonged to Jon Matonis. Jon's seat only came open when he resigned *after* the blog post you are citing.

The board sets the election schedule. At the time that post was written the board had not done so.

That was a mistake and we'll have the post corrected.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:57:00
So a rush job to hold elections when *you* think is the *right* time would have led to more attention and participation? Less time to discuss, debate and promote would result in less voter apathy?
Taking more time to implement sound procedures certainly helped bring more people into the process. Not as many as we'd like but there are a lot of reasons why some voters aren't exercising their rights and I doubt the reason is that we didn't rush to cobble together an election in January.
Easy to criticize people for not doing things *just so* when you don't actually have to do those things.
