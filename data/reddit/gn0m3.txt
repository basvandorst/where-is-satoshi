Hashtalk is also filtering users posts from people still. I was wondering why i wasn't getting responses or even views to my posts and tested whether they showed up when I wasn't logged in as well as confirming with other users. My posts display only to me as the user and not to the community at large. This is the final straw. This business, this platform, this crypto currency is playing dodgy and I'm now taking action.
this may have been the comment that did it:
 is it not possible for your communications team to be a bit more proactive with the updates instead of waiting for issues to be raised by the community, and us having to speculate as to what the issues may be. Seriously, this is what I see as the big failure here, the lack of communication, and the inability to contain problems before they get out of hand.
All things a great communications and legal team would alleviate.

I've made contact and awaiting response.  I'm following up on every other transgression too.  
They've made an enemy of me, previously an invested supporter, by making a fool of me, shadow banning me, and deceiving me over and over again.  (speaking personally, I realise, of course, their are many in the same boat).

you may not have digested what i was saying, as you appear to echo just that.

to me the problem is that mining consumes energy, and a lot of it.   It's an unsustainable practice and unsustainable practices will eventually die as logic prevails.  Same as your petro-dollar, or precious metal currency.  
At some point, it makes no sense to expend all this energy for some perceived value we place on things.
