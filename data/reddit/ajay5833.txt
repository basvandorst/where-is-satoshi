I came to know about bit coin in 2013 , but it started in 2009 , means I came to know after 4 years . Right now also I am thinking some new innovations things similar to block chain will go on . We have to find them early . And we have to invest . Do u know any new tech that makes money or any new form of money ... at first ICO look great for me , but most of them are robbing people’s hard earned money. So sad 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:18:20
Do u think coinbase also ends like that ?
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:15:19
Those things are not in our hands , means we can’t invest money in them and we can’t make money with that projects , any new new things that Mel’s money for us . Like block chain , ICO, some thing like that...
That tech should be in initial stage

I want to be rich !!! I am 27 and if any thing goes wrong I can cover it. If it gave 30% return . I will sell and I will repay that loan . Do I need to pay capital gain taxes if I get profit???
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:35:46
Really I don’t have fear. I just want to be rich!!!!!
I ready to take loss or gain in same way. So, no problem . May be it take 10 days to get money . Hope price will settle down at 1300-1400. And I don’t want to invest on other coins .i think they are more dangerous .

@_date: 2017-07-16 20:17:32
Opportunity won’t come every day, when the bitcoin was 350 I just brought 0.001 . Do u know how much pain I felt. At that time I have 8900 in my bank . But still I didn’t . Because of my friends . This time I don’t want to loose opportunity . I want to make it big . I have savings of 15000 and I will put that money if price go down more . If I reach 100k in profit . I will buy HTLZF stock ! It’s my plan 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:21:32
Lol��... sure I will do it��
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:41:45

Sorry, my English is not good
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:54:06
May be it will touch 1400-1500 then it will go up to 6000. If it touch below 1400 , then next target is 800 only. Don’t try to catch falling knife ...and don’t buy unless it touch 3000 with high volumes . I think ripple looks like scam . I am planing to take discover personal loan  to invest in crypto, waiting for good time 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:12:48
Finally it’s a matter of greed and fear.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:39:03
Nooo, risk reward is not at good level . Must have to wait till it comes to 1300-1400. If it won’t come I will follow plan B
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:21:11
Yes!!!! If I get 100 votes  , I will sure do it . Thanks for your support. My friends are telling it’s a bad idea 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:05:13
It’s a nice idea! But I don’t like to buy in average method. I know in some cases it is good. But I think it won’t work out in crypto.
As I told u I have 15000$ and I started working since  3 years . I repaid my college fees and some family personal loan. 
I won’t spent 1$ on unwanted things . I the thing really I want, I won’t care about price . So I am not a spender.  
Yes, I will play gamble . But only 250$/ month .
I always take calculated risk .
This time I am thinking big and making big !!
I just got 13 votes ..... I am thinking now .�� 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:55:38
I want to become rich and  I want to make it big .
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:05:20
I will wait till price reach 1400-1500
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:31:15
Lol.. roller table don’t have greed and fear logic. And it doesn’t have emotions . But people who are playing with  BITCOIN  have all these things. NO rules and no market timings like stock market .
No valuations , only fear and greed , pump and dump
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:09:28
Yes, any new technology alternative for money . 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:12:03
Just DO IT !!!! I will take the lone and start investing once it reach 1400-1500 ,if it won’t come to that price I have plan B . I will buy HTLZF stock with that money 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:29:17
Lol, I read almost 6 books on investing . I Want to buy HTLZF stock . I want to earn money in BTC and want to invest in that . If u don’t know that company look it to it.
As I told, fucking casino don’t have emotions, greed and fear, technicals charts. But bitcoin traders have those . 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:26:37
 Right now I am getting salary of 4500$/ month . Every month I need to pay 835$ for 5 years. So , I think it won’t be difficult to repay. When comes to the risk part, I am 27 so, no problem . And bit coin has strong support at 1750 and 1300 . So low risk , high reward . Hope every thing goes well . So exited !!!  Till now I have 0.001 BTC. This time I am making it BIG!!!
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:51:45
Thanks for your detailed view. Interest rate is 15% for 5 years . Means I need to pay 835$/ month . If price 2x or 3x in 1 year . I can pay my debt back . There is no special charge if I pay early. 
I always compare BTC market cap with apple Market cap. 33B vs 750B. And total gold value is 8TRI. Hope bitcoin market cap will be 150-300 billion
I know in not a genius .bit I want to do it
