This is exactly why I'm looking forward to bitshares. Having bitcoin technology but pricing everything in USD or whatever currency because the bitUSD will track the exact price. We are almost there people.. Just some more tweaking :)

It should be possible over Bitshares in the near future. This will also be decentralized :) we are living in an awesome era people :)

It has. BitUSD is released. And it works by the look of it. So the thing most people said it wouldt work about the concept works. This is big news to the crypto community I think..

Problem is lot of technology experts see that mining is a thing of the past. It is too expensive. The bitcoin technology works without it now (DPOS). Bitcoin has to "take one for the team" for the crypto space community in my opinion. Bitcoin won't switch to DPOS because minners payed a lot of money for equipment. The sad part is that there are so many "fans" who dont care about technology and only about money. They will defend bitcoin to the death instead of supporting the technology. BitUSD for example is so much better that bitcoin in any way. Faster transactions, stable price backed by bitshares. Bitcoin is altavista in my opinion. I love the technology but with every technology there will soon be a better one.

Looking forward to bitshares. Decentralized Exchanges is what we need.

Can you explain why? Or do you just say that because you have no clue how the system works? If you insult someone you should really explain the reason. Otherwise you will just sound like a jackass

As a software developer I don't see why it should not be possible to simulate a bank. All the financial instruments are already automated in a bank. If there is a prediction market it will track the price of USD. Things like mtGox will then not happen again because we have a decentralized exchange for out bitcoins.

I would have agreed with you a month ago. But after reading the bitshares whitepaper I think it is possible to have both. decentralized and pegging close to USD. But we will see. It will be another social experiment like bitcoin is. If it is possible it will also help bitcoin getting more stable.
