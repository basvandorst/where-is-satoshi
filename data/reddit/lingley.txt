Well BTCKing was selling bitcoin on the silkroad in exchange for greendot money packs.. the DEA probably bought some bitcoin off of him and watched to see where the greendot money pack was deposited.. they also had access to all the messages sent between users on the silk road... so that would be my guess as to how they got busted.

I forgot to add the exclamation to the question.. may have thrown you off. 
stated as a question,"amiright" is a declaration of correctness even when wrong. Most often used when giving a socially accepted opinion. "amiright" is also used to humor those taking the statement too seriously.
Often followed by a 'high-five'... a "amiright" can be either be false of truth. OR a sarcastic dismissal.
"that bitch is cold. amiright!?" *high-fives ensue*
"I'm so drunk I could fuck a panda." *awkward looks* "amiright!?" *high-fives ensue*
"I worked so hard my dick fell off, amiright!?" *awkward looks* "AMIRIGHT!?"... *reaches for high-five*

Don't send it to mtgox.. If you want to cash out setup an account on coinbase.com and sell them there. You'll actually get your money instead of waiting months for it to show up. If you just want to sell now so you can buy back later, use a different exchange like bitstamp or btc-e..

Pretty much spot on.. I wasn't thinking of inherent value correctly. I still think they have some intrinsic value, but you are right if you can't find a buyer what good are they? Without the advent of the silk road they probably wouldn't have gone anywhere.

That's a difficult question to answer, but I'll give it a shot. 
So bitcoins in reality don't really exist. When you own a bitcoin all you own is the address and the keys associated with that address. When someone sends bitcoin to your address it is entered as a trasactoin in the blockchain which is basically just a big ledger book. 
Every ten minutes the blockchain gets the trascations that occurred in the previous 10 minutes added to it. You can think of this as a time stamp. It is a necessary part of the bitcoin protocol because without it you wouldn't be able to keep track of who owned what because people would be able to spend their bitcoins twice. 
The only way to add a block to the blockchain is to solve this really difficult algorithm. When you find the solution to the problem you are rewarded with 25 new bitcoin that are added to total supply of bitcoin in circulation. You get this reward because you did the work to secure the blockchain/ledger book.
Does that make any sense?

The Bank of Russia warns that Russian legal entities providing services for the exchange of "virtual currency" in rubles and foreign currency, as well as for goods (and services) will be considered as potential engagement in questionable transactions in accordance with the legislation on counteracting legalization of proceeds (also known as money laundering) from crime and funding of terrorism.

@_date: 2014-01-27 04:05:05
Yeah you need atm's that you can cash in and out of. It makes the btc a kind of savings account that is speculative. It also would allow you to send money to someone and have them be able to cash out easily. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:26:37
coinbase is good for cashing out completely, you'll end up with money in your bank account.. not so good for day trades though because it takes a couple days to get your money in and out. 
 
If you don't feel good about btc-e go with bitstamp. Good luck!

That's the same argument that got us off the gold standard in the first place. We don't need the gold so we can just print as many dollars as we want.. free money. That is what the Federal Reserve does on a daily basis. It leads to debt and inflation. Bitcoins don't need gold backing because of the math governing their production.. there is a limit, just like when we had a gold backed dollar. There was a limit to the amount of dollars produced. Peter Schiff is so anti Bitcoin because he sees it as competition for the gold backed securities that he sells.. in my humble opinion. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:58:59
So can you withdraw to your bank account as well?
@_date: 2014-01-26 09:04:07
That's what I'm saying.. The Feds, the Fbi, are selling the bitcoin.. the Federal Reserve buys them at auction, and then turns around and sells them on the exchanges to cause a crash.. just to fuck with bitcoin.. because they don't want a competing currency. 
Like I said.. conspiracy theorist in me. I don't think this scenario is likely.. but it could happen. 
Doesn't have to be the Federal Reserve, could be any entity that see's bitcoin as a threat... Visa, Mastercard, Western Union, ect.. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 10:47:46
I'm saying we expect the price to fall because of China around the end of the week. If it does, that would be the best time for you to buy.

The algorithm used in bitcoin is SHA-256. It is a cryptographic hash function that was designed by the U.S. National Security Agency and published in 2001 by the NIST as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard. SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. 
After you solve a block you get the 25 bitcoin, and the answer you found is then part of the problem that must be solved for the next block. 
You could argue that bitcoin has no real inherent value. But the miners who spent time and energy producing bitcoins aren't going to sell you a bitcoin for nothing because they have invested real money in the equipment and electricity. 
The intrinsic value is based on the fact that is is easy to trade across the internet. 
The price of bitcoin increases or decreases based on supply and demand. It is really a free market in that regard. But every 4 years the reward the miners receive from mining the bitcoins is cut in half.. This creates a certain amount of scarcity and drives the price up as well. The total bitcoin volume will top out at 21 million bitcoins in 2141 or something like that... so yes their is a hold in place to prevent the bitcoin value and total bitcoin volume from increasing.

What gives them their intrinsic value is their utility in facilitating near instant and anonymous payment with no middle man. He is right that they have no inherent value, but you could argue that the inherent value is the cost that went into their production combined with their perceived scarcity.

@_date: 2014-01-27 17:08:20
$40 bucks a day is what you could expect after paying for electricity.. There isn't a cheap way to get into bitcoin mining that will make you any money.. cheapest way to get into mining for a profit is with a good video card mining altcoins and trading for bitcoin, or just mine on middlecoin.com.. they do the trading for you and pay out it bitcoin everyday. That isn't going to be cheap unless you already have a motherboard with a pci express slot.. head over to if you want to learn more about scrypt mining. I wouldn't recommend mining litecoin at the moment.. you can see what is the most profitable at the moment at

Don't really think bitcoin is old enough for anything to be standard yet. Imagine if bitcoin is worth $100,000 like we hope it will be.. now you send a payment to someone and you screw up and send 0.000069 bitcoin when you meant to send 0.0000069.. how do you like counting 0's? Wouldn't it be easier to see how much you are spending if you could put some comas in there.. 69,000 is way easier to differentiate from 6,900 than 0.000069 is from 0.0000069.

Go to the page on coinbase where it says the order is pending.. there should be an option to cancel up until the time you actually receive the bitcoin, so if you don't have the bitcoin yet you can cancel. That's the way it was setup back in April anyway.. haven't used coinbase in a while.

I was selling some digitalcoin for bitcoin last night.. the trade wasn't going through so I cancelled. I got the digitalcoin back and then a few minutes later I received the bitcoin as well. Tried to place another order just to see what would happen and was able to sell the digitalcoin again. I'm guessing this is what caused their current snafu. 
I wish there was a more reliable place to sell my mined alt coins.

It does that. Get used to it.

Mine the litecoins and trade for bitcoin is much more profitable at this point than mining bitcoins directly.

It worked out better for me. I placed an order on Monday for 1 bitcoin, it cost 105, i checked the box that said I agreed to paying the market price on Friday, but on Friday I received 1 bitcoin for the 105 even though the market price was 143 or so. I think it worked like this because i placed the order right as they introduced this new method of purchase and it wasn't setup all the way yet. At any rate, I was happy because I was already up 40 bucks or so. 
Also I was unable to cancel the transaction, I looked for the button, but the option was unavailable on the website, which makes me think it wasn't fully implemented yet.

It isn't stupid to sell as it is going down if you plan on buying back at a lower price..

I was looking at the most profitable sha256 coin on coinwarz.. up to 55 cents a day now if you mined Unobtanium.. never heard of that one.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:58:47
Ditto. Same problem. Was trying to purchase litecoin with worldcoin and my worldcoin disapeared as well. Also sent some bitcoin and it hasn't posted in over 4 hours. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:57:15
Thanks for the heads up.. I've been mining on middlecoin but just switched over to hash cows
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:50:41
That is a really good idea.
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:35:28
Buying at the all time high.. smart move? I don't think so. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:48:25
Happened to me last night with Worldcoin.. setup a trade and the worldcoin just disapeared. Submitted a ticket.. haven't heard anything or seen the worldcoin pop back up. Going to withdraw all my coin.

Sorry bro. Doesn't seem fair that they changed it. Makes buying bitcoin there a gamble unless you add a visa card and purchase instantly. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:40:34
Not made up.. this dude was breaking bad. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:31:59
litecoin more than doubled in price in the past 24 hours

Try multipool. Been earning me .03 btc per day with 2 gpus
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:35:06
You do realize you can cancel that first order, correct?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:57:08
Didn't know that. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 20:42:26
If i were a Turk I'd rather have cash than bitcoin.. too risky. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:49:56
Don't feel too bad. I bought 250 bitcoin for $500 and sold them for $1500 a couple years ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:15:04
I'd say coinbase could replace paypal if they played their cards right. Or a site like coinbase that added in an escrow system.

I believe it was in the first indictment out of New York.

Mine some prime coin with your CPU. Basically free btc.

They cut the cost of the usb miners to .99 btc yesterday. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:55:07
I would. I don't see a problem with it. I think it's unethical for coinbase to not let you cancel the transaction via their webpage.
You could submit a ticket and tell them you no longer have the funds available and see what they say. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:01:25
Use multibit wallet instead. You don't have to download the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:46:42
how do you plan on getting the usd in to btc-e? 
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:17:17
Actually he did. He grew shrooms and sold them on the silk road when it was brand new.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:39:42
People who bought it for $30 back in 2011 had a loss after 6 months.. when it was trading for $2.. just sayin. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:17:20
IT would be cool to 3d print one of these somehow.

I was really enjoying all the post on there today. All the drama surrounding the shutdown and arrest was intriguing. 
It's probably good they shut it down though.. vendors posting on there could easily be targeted by law enforcement.
I always thought the vendors posting on that sub-reddit were asking for trouble. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:15:09
OK didn't know that. Thanks for the info, glad I wasn't missing out.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:54:37
Try posting this in r/bitcoinmining
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:36:01
cryptsy is shitting the bed. I'm done with them as soon as i can get my coins out of their exchange.. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:07:37
Because you can't withdraw usd from mtgox, and it is also a pain to deposit usd into btc-e
