True. It is still early. 
One a**hole at my workplace says he will buy Bitcoins when it gets back to $3. LMFAO!!!

To avoid confusion, any hard forked crypto from Bitcoin or any other new crypto should not use the word Bitcoin when listing in a chart.
- Bitcoin Cash should be called Bcash
- Bitcoin Gold should be called Bgold
- Bitcoin Diamond should be called Bdiamond
- Bitcoin Whatever should be called Bwhatever
**There is only one Bitcoin**, and it is called Bitcoin. Everything else is an altcoin.

Thanks for sharing your experience but I actually found the answer on their website: 
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:42:08
Does the rate get locked in when you initiate the exchange at changelly, or do they readjust rate when they receive my funds? 
Suppose I initiate the order for BCH to USDT for 1 BCH = 250 USDT. I send my BCH from my wallet to changelly and it takes 2 hours and changelly receives my BCH after 2 hours. But after 2 hours 1 BCH = 200 USDT. What rate do I get? 200 USDT or 250 USDT?
(It's like the precise and quick option in shapeshift)

Bitcoin might have a hard time is if a third world war breaks out and we lose a significant portion of the internet. In times like that, gold and silver will shine. But personally, like you, I do not like the physical properties of gold. It is not easy to stash.

Well it's not what you think it is. I did not send my bitcoins to the wrong address. It was just bad trades. My plan was to sell high and buy low, so that I end up with more bitcoins. But in the end I had buy back the bitcoins at a higher price than I sold them for.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:03:00
Amen. Hodling is the safest strategy in the long run.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:04:45
Yes, I did. And since the loss I am holding for dear life. Any BTC that goes to the hardware wallet stays there from now on, like a one way street. Maybe when BTC reaches $100k I might cash a few.
@_date: 2018-06-17 05:08:47
FOMO gripped me. I bought back at $7,800. So if I waited and bought now, I would have not lost any BTC at all. But that meant I had to sleep with FOMO for months. Even though I lost 12 BTC, I still have enough for my needs, hoping BTC reaches $100k in the next couple of years.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:01:40
That's sad to hear. I learnt my lesson. I am hodling since the loss. I am down \~12 BTC but still have enough to change my life.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:43:35


All you need is give your bitcoin address to the person who will be paying you. Your wallet can stay offline. You will only need to connect your wallet to the laptop/phone when you want to spend anything from your wallet.
All transactions take place in the blockchain (a public ledger; dont confuse with the wallet Ledger). Your Ledger Nano S does not store the transactions. There is no Bitcoin stored in your Ledger Nano S. You Ledger Nano S only has the private keys which unlocks your wealth (Bitcoins) in the blockchain.

Bitcoin Cash is a cancer. Coinbase definitely should consider stopping BCH sales on coninbase.com. Coinbase is meant to onboard new users to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) is just confusing new users. This is bad for everyone: new users, the Bitcoin users, and coinbase themselves.

They should actually encourage low transaction fees. They don't need the tip right away. Waiting an hour or two is fine.

The third party here means the party which can take control of the wealth. When you transfer money through Banks, the Banks may seize the money; you are in the mercy of the Banks involved. WIth Bitcoin, there is no third party because miners cannot seize the money.

Looking at the amount of effort that goes into mining 1 Bitcoin, I would not call it a bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:04:02
I will wait for Trezor 2.0 then in that case. I already own a Trezor. I just wish Trezor used a more premium plastic or metal body. It feels like a cheap toy in my hand.
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:40:04
For hardware wallets, Trezor or Ledger Nano S should be fine. Keepkey is very slow when it comes to supporting new forked coins, as was the case with Bcash/Bitcoin Cash. Also Keepkey is operated by the evil guys who are pushing for S2X.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:24:07

Cointree has a nice easy to use interface and very user friendly. Their fees and how much Bitcoin you will get at the end of the transaction is not transparent. When you initiate the buy, they give you an estimate of how much Bitcoin you will get but after they process your deposit the price of Bitcoin may have changed and they do not lock-in the rates. 
They need to make things more transparent and they can become the Coinbase of Australia. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:07:56
It's a bit too expensive. Although I have no idea what Trezoe 2 is going to cost.

I have both wallets, Trezor and Ledger. If you use the same 24 word seed to restore your wallet on both Trezor and Ledger, you get the exact same wallet, with the exact same private keys, with the exact same funds. 
This is what I do and gives me the convenience of using whichever wallet (Trezor or Ledger) to use to get the new forked Bitcoin. If Trezor is first to come up with the support for the new forked Bitcoin, I can use Trezor to get my free coins. If Ledger is first to come up with the support for the new forked Bitcoin, I can use Ledger to get my free coins.

I guess you need to use the Chrome extension or mobile phone app to enter the passphrase. The screen I have seen for Trezor 2 is not practical to enter alpha passphrase. Entering numeric PIN is possible though

~~Don't know about Nano S. But if you really have no choice, you can use the 24 word seed to restore the wallet on Electrum and use the Opt-In RBF feature in Electrum. However, this exposes your private keys to any malware that might be hiding in the device you will be running Electrum on.~~
Looks like you can use your Ledger Nano with Electrum without trying to restore the wallet on Electrum:

Yes, we need people to use their BTC to make purchases. This will make BTC popular with more and more businesses. But make sure you rebuy the 0.0008 BTC.
I guess BTC is a bit too expensive for making coffee purchases, taking into account the confirmation time and transaction fee. **Litecoin** is perfect for buying things like coffee or meals; faster confirmation time and less transaction fee. Bitcoin is good for bigger things, like cars and houses.
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:49:05
Coinbase - can use credit card, fee around 4%
Bitstamp - can use credit card, fee around 8%
Btcmarkets - poli or direct bank deposit
Independent Reserve - poli or bank deposit
Cointree - poli or bank deposit
I recommend btcmarkets. You get a good rate and initial commission is around 0.75%
