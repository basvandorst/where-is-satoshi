What I would like from a wallet: it integrates with the contacts list in the os (I'm doing osx). 
You can associate one bitcoin address with a contact. So one contact will have many addresses, and one address will have one contact.

That's how the system works, but it's still not good enough.

Is Karpeles alive? How's he doing? While he's an idiot I feel bad for him. Few fuck up that bad.

Except that you can vote with your feet, changing pool is as easy as changing one line in your config file.

It's just mysterious when you buy a house but have no declared savings.

So, can we really trust javascript with bitcoin? It's a great language to do many things, but it's not famous for being good at crypto.

I'm sorry but this discussion must the the most stupid thing I've read in ages. 
* Do you know what a bit it? It's one unit of binary information. The decimal number 15 in binary is 1111, and `"1111".length()` `=&gt; 4`, it's a 4 bit number. 
* Don't call it *metric* prefixes. It's SI-prefixes, fucktards. 
* Do you think the way people think of USD/EURO is the only way? In Japan 1000¥ buys you lunch, in Germany €10. People are used to that. Everything doesn't have to be like in the US, just because you've never seen anything else. On the internet, 0.022 bitcoins can get you a lunch. Or count in satoshis + SI prefixes. 
Don't be an idiot.
