It's not too difficult to withdraw BTC from Mt Gox then use another exchange to convert to USD. Of course you'd need an account and AML verification with the other exchange, but anyone trading more than a couple of BTC should do this regardless.
So this is great news for Bitstamp and CampBX...

Great idea! I like this even more than [Terk's wordpress tip plugin]( as you've baked in satire which is far more valuable than most blog posts.
One suggestion, could clicking the tip link beneath the article bring up the same pop-over with QR code that clicking the BTC amount in the header does? People are less likely to have set up a bitcoin: URL handler on each of the computers/devices they use to read the internets.

It is also worth mentioning that everyone should understand the asset categories for 'bail-in' that have been legislated in their country.
Some countries have stopped at bond holders, and others have defined an amount above which you are a 'large depositor'.
However, the OP mentions 'gold and other assets' may be confiscated, but I was not able to find a country that has introduced legislation to this effect (*but I'm sure that some will in due course*)
I've always held the opinion that the wealthiest people in the country always appear as the most in debt to the bank. They already understood the risk of bail-in long ago, not to mention the tax offsetting that is possible when you can show you are in debt.

The big 4 NZ banks process their own wire transfers so they aren't affected. It's banks like Kiwibank, Rabobank, TSB that use Citibank or HSBC to process international transfers so have to play by their rules.

Does Australia tax personal currency speculation as income?




The above statements from ATO appear to make the case that buying BTC at a low price and selling it some time later at a high price constitutes an income. Therefore if you don't have records of when you acquired BTC they could audit and tax you under suspicion of income derived from BTC speculation.

Your bonus question is really the core question. Credit only really works if there is a return in terms of interest or dividends that would be greater than if you had held onto the currency. Deflation is the main reason that the gold standard was scrapped, since then the credit based economy has thrived with inflation fueling it along.
Most fiat currencies use the central bank / government official cash rate as the basis for their interest calculations. Bitcoin has no central bank so there is no basis for agreeing interest rates.

$20NZD is standard across all the NZ banks.
Forex sites like XE &amp; currency online expect you verify that you own the receiving bank account. So they will continue to handle your NZD to USD conversions in **your** US bank account, but they won't facilitate sending funds to Mt Gox.

According to [wikipedia]( tl;dr


Since bitcoin has the genus of money it can't in itself earn interest under Islamic principles. However, buying bonds or stocks on bitfunder or btct.co is acceptable and where a dividend is earned everything is kosher.
Other sites that establish a lending contract such as btcjam &amp; bitfinex are probably acceptable as a lender is in essence buying a bond that the other party will buy back from them for a higher price.

Not necessarily, the bank could have been complaining for a long time for all we know, and Mt Gox is finally doing something to improve the situation.
Without Dwolla as an option for USD funding/withdrawal Mt Gox is coming under more pressure to process wire transfers faster, or else people will switch to other exchanges that aren't facing the same problems (yet).

If you did include the private key in your will, then your family would likely pay inheritance tax on the BTC amount in the wallet.
So having a 'joint' wallet with your family / loved ones is a better way to manage the wealth.
How about a wallet service that registers your private key, the public keys of each of your inheritors, and what percentage should go to each. Then if you didn't log in periodically, it could sweep the BTC and send a percentage to each of the public addresses.

Agreed, it is a quality article. However, the title is misleading 'trading' is not the same a simply acquiring bitcoin, making transactions, and accepting bitcoin as a payment method. Nonetheless, it is a good getting started guide for the web design/development crowd.

Under New Zealand tax law it is somewhat simpler because there isn't a capital gains tax. Therefore an individual buying and holding an asset that appreciates in value doesn't need to be declared as income. However, actively trading the asset to return a profit is considered taxable income.

I wonder if they will still process incoming transfers from Mt Gox... 
Perhaps they are trying to encourage you to launder your money through other accounts so they don't know that the funds are associated with Mt Gox / Bitcoin in general ;)

There are other wallets that have low fees and accept bank transfers, so nothing unique there either.
What the article didn't capture is that they are offering 3 services in 1: Wallet + Exchange + Merchant account
They also should provide more detail about their security: SSL &amp; hashed passwords are expected for any wallet - but they don't have 2 factor authentication (yet)?


So what is this managed cold storage solution and how is it protecting my private keys?

Any 'store of value' outside of fiat currencies is a 'contingency' as the geo-political powers that be legislate 'bail-in'.
Bitcoin happens to be one of the easier store of values to buy into, and should enjoy a low correlation to fiat currency values if/when things get messy in fiat.
@_date: 2013-06-21 01:34:53
This is a well written article with a sound argument advising against investing in fiat currencies that are becoming subject to geo-political influence. However, the author does have a bias towards bitcoin, as does the publisher in providing a bitcoin trading platform.
I would counter that not all fiat currencies are subject to geo-political influence, rather it is a relative scale, so investing in currencies (fiat or virtual) at the low end of the scale is safer, but it's certainly not without risks due to the usual market forces and price volatility.

It should only take the bitcoin community to lobby some of the more liberal states to get the ball rolling.
Past attempts that have failed were led by big business or federal govt - this would be community led, and with a lot of small businesses in the bitcoin community it should get the attention of state legislators.

Now that I know about nLockTime, this is my preferred disaster recovery method.
In the case that either you pass away, or *you are locked out of your wallet*, then your bitcoins will still be transferred.
This negates the risk of including the private key in your will (or entrusting it to your loved ones) as only sometime after you pass away will there be any BTC they could access.
If you take it a step further and setup the destination address with a service like BitPay or ZipBit, then it could automatically cash-out the bitcoin and deposit the proceeds into your bank account. As such, the bank account is the only thing you need to include in your will.
All that's needed now is for apps like Electrum or Blockchain.info to support nLockTime, and potentially allow for configurable reminders leading up to the transaction date.

Jaron seems to miss the point that dominant players do adapt to be stronger due to the smaller players that present 'better' solutions and try to complete in the virtual currency space.
It then seems really irresponsible that he closes with:


I posit that most people speculating in alternative cryptocurrencies are unlikely to believe that it is the perfect virtual currency that will someday replace Bitcoin, rather that there is value in competing cryptocurrencies and that supporting the cryptocurrency marketplace as a whole will in turn benefit Bitcoin in becoming a better virtual currency.

I was looking for something similar for fundraising on behalf of a local cancer charity.
What I've found is bitcoinchipin.com provides easy widgets to track the fundraising goal on your own website, and bitpay.com can convert the bitcoins to fiat currency (they waive the fees for registered US charities - although that wouldn't apply to your friend).
It would be great to see a unified site with all the functionality built in, and judging by the numerous discussions on bitcointalk, I'm sure it's only a matter of time.
