What do you mean? Gmail stores my emails on their servers. Gmail's servers. Not quite like the blockchain.

Actually, considering what's implied from the other headlines, I'd think a comparison would be made to something other than USD. Perhaps stocks?

It is impossible that I didn't just comment in response to you.

This 'business idea' already exists. It's called being rich and having your own personal stylist, chef, IT guy, whatever.

Here's some free QA as well: in your 5th screenshot on the app store page: Get **an** new address.

i.e specialized skills.
Unless you're talking about writing code that does that? Seems ambitious to me.
@_date: 2014-08-11 22:16:29
And we can know exactly how much is unaccounted for (you can't know if a bank has 10 gold bars it isn't telling you about, or 100000)
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:47:50
OK, but this is relevant to all industries, not just bitcoin.

Maybe it's another form of [reCAPTCHA](

So, are you guys normalizing everything to satoshis on the backend?
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:36:51
Nah, it's pretty good. If you're worried someone might have gone into your safe and replaced your cash with a Total Recall holographic thingie (i.e - your server security might not be airtight), then you should at least occasionally check your cash not just by looking at it through the safe window, but also by going in and actually touching it (i.e - comparing to the blockchain)

Please explain why log charts are pointless for the long run.

Not when it's because you are 15 and know you are financially set for life with money you didn't earn yourself. 
Unless you're Batman.

Keep a paper wallet as well, in a safe somewhere. You can make paper wallets which will also require another small password that you remember in your head. Also, make it multi-sig and spread them around different locations.

But didn't you reach this conclusion based on past performance of those who failed/conned others?
@_date: 2017-02-20 13:05:15
Well... Yeah. I mean, think of a bank 200 years ago. It'll be much easier to rob than banks today
@_date: 2014-09-19 00:28:45
I... but....... MOON!

So who's Yoko Ono?

Uhhh... quite easily? Hey, I have 1 banana, let's trade it back and forth 10,000 times.

Mike Judge. He also did idiocracy :)
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:42:24
Well, perhaps due to meat printing, eating what we currently call a cheeseburger in 2050 would be pretty difficult (and therefore expensive) because slaughtering cows for a cheeseburger (not to mention the milking for the cheese... dear lord) would be kind of like mink coats. Expensive, but only old people are willing to pay a lot for it.

I assume only their wallets are registered for trades. Hence their wallets are on the blockchain, i.e transparent to all. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 21:47:20
bitcoin's price = bitcoin's market demand. So you're saying it's bad he doesn't control the market's (i.e - other people's) demand for bitcoin? It's bad he isn't .. god?
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:04:20
So he also sold all his stocks?
@_date: 2016-10-14 17:59:26
Yeah, shitty currency, dies to doom blade.

So Xeroxable!

His sense of superiority

Nobody will loan you anything without being compensated by interest. Present/Future value of money and all that.

That's not what he asked. He's worried about losing the algorithm which given your seed and your passphrase makes a wallet out of them.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:26:52
Just to clarify, I also agree this isn't necessarily a problem. I'm just curious as to what the community thinks about this.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:22:56
Your'e neglecting the inherent ad value of accepting bitcoins. Heck, he might get a 5 minute spot in a local TV station if he plays his cards right.
Also, for the optimists in this thread, this is a long term investment.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:31:39
Weird little things. Their intrinsic value was limited to the country that made them. Remember countries? You probably learned about them in your holo-studies.
