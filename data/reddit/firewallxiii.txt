1) It depends, mostly comes down to do you want predictable steady output or variable? (PPS vs Prop.) Theoretically its equal in the long term, although with pool hopping (going from pool to pool) you can make more, best advice I can give is to mine for a few days to a week at each your considering and compare results, it takes time.
2) Can't really comment on that, but I'd suggest using a calculator such as: 
3) The bitcoin forums are generally pretty helpful. 
4) Depends on the apocalypse cause (ie zombies risk of infection, nuclear risk of radiated meat, etc). Need more info. 
5) You won't have much of an output, generally 1Mhash/s per 1GHz per core (assuming 64bit capable).
Hope this helped. Good luck!

Hmm. Any chance of having an option to receive only the information to use in online transactions?

For Visa and Amex card, do you mail the physical card, or just send the card number and codes? Also, what's the average delivery time on the gift cards?

Ah that explains it. I read it as you were using the 6870. I'd suggest two things though:  
1. Overclock the core /downclock the memory to 300mhz  
2. Have a look at:  
  It'll give you some sample arguments to maximize your rate. Good luck!
