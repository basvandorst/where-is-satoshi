Well... I would say you are referring to Bitcoins or crypto currency in general, and not to my actual post about that the first Bitcoin ATM were launched in Spain... Please keep to the subject.

don't miss out that Dorschm has launched another PTC site yesterday! Now supporting not only Bitcoins, but also other Altcoins! To me it all looks very promising! I'm in - and if you want - please join my team at: [COINTOCLICK](

even if it looks bad right now - this will just be a bump in the road for Bitcoin. it's here to stay. Question is on what level it will even out or stabilize a bit?! Anyone that has any thoughts on that one? 
Will we see +1000 usd value again?

Just want to give some cred to Dorschm on this one. Bittoclick is actually in my opinion the best PTC i have seen yet, in the Bitcoin area at least. BUT what's really makes a difference is that Dorsch is actually listening to what the users say and want, and develop features according to the needs and wants. He is not hiding and taking the money from you as a user! This really works, and really well! I have several times since I came onboard withdrawn money (bit coins), and I have also several times bought ads, and also converted earnings into referrals... 
Also a system built up for me as an upline sponsor to have communication with my referrals, to be able to help them in any way. THIS is the way this kind of program should be!
Feel free to join me if you like here: [Mikael's Bittoclick](   or [here]( for just joining Bittoclick (but not in [My downline]( and with my help) :-)

I can agree to that - and that is also way I raise the question. What's the real deal with the ATMs for Bitcoins really?! besides that someone is profiting by delivering them.

Why do you say that?

There is actually another one that should be rather interesting. It is in prelaunch now, so if you want to be in from the very start - to act now is a good decision. (Sistersite of Bittoclick)

Just adding one more to the list - that sure looks very promising. 
You earn in USD that are converted into BTC in payout - good now when the BTC rate is so low!
