Only if you dont pay it off.
From a consumer perspective, credit cards also come with a hell of a lot more benefits (points) and protections against fraud than BTC.

So what happens when all legacy bitcoin have been mined? does the currency die because there will be no transactions?

Visa will.

A few days ago people said "support" was at 10k. Before that 12. Before that 14.
I feel like people in this community just throw that term around to feel better about their speculation. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:09:49
Most consumers see the ability to chargeback as a huge benefit. It offers consumers far more protection than irreversible payment methods, and keeps a very useful buffer between fraudulent charges and their bank accounts.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:52:03
BTCs price jump to 19k and subsequent fall to 8 shows that, utility or not, its current price is subject to the whims of speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:28:30
LN isnt limited to only BTC.
Even if you believe in the tech, investment is speculation in the future of the tech. Crypto is certainly not to the point yet where mass adoption is feasible. Many people believe it will be one day... but until it actually happens, it's speculation.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:14:49
Less exposed to fraud how?
If someone gets into my BTC wallet or an exchange takes a nasty turn, or a million other things happen, im out money with no protections. If someone gets my cc  I call visa and its sorted hassle free in an hour. Never even touched my bank balance.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:28:29
Mhm. If you think a system where people lose entirely if their accounts get hacked is better than one with nominal, nominal fees and the security we have now, then I have nothing more to say.

In practice, a fraud loss with bitcoin means the individual is out the entire amount.
Like I said, good luck convincing the average consumer that that is better.

As a fellow no coiners, I am convinced there will be a future for blockchain.

And this is exactly why people worry about BTC as an investment. This is a sub for discussion about bitcoin, not a sub for sucking bitcoin off.
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:02:05
If it is not centralized, then who provides the protections?
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:26:01
Yes, it would be. For the average user, the credit card system is a safety buffer.
Credit cards (and debit cards to a lesser degree) have significant built in protections. Fraud with a credit card? No big deal, dispute the transactions and let visa sort it out. My balance is never effected. 
On a debit card, itll affect your balance for a bit but probably eventually get resolved.
With bitcoin... you would be shit out of luck.
Many people use credit cards simply as a buffer between fraud and their bank account. That is, even though there's an extra step involved in paying off the cc, they accept that because of the extra protections it provides. Not to mention concierge services and the ability to dispute transactions / chargeback.
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:07:19
I am not saying I know, I am saying that it is important to have a discussion about. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:42:05


Come on now, I understand the already mined bitcoins would still exist. I don't have the intellectual capacity of a sea cucumber.
What I was pointing out is that according to if no one mines, there will be no nodes and so no blocks and no transactions. This implies to me that continuous mining is necessary for transactions to happen, though I could be misinterpreting.
Banking on altruistic mining seems a bit bold, doesn't it? Mining is expensive. I would bet that few if any would do it out of the good nature of their hearts?
Are you really willing to bet on the idea that there would be enough altruistic miners to support a theoretically mass-adopted bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:31:04
Credit card usage is not all about "debt". Responsible credit card users never or rarely carry a balance.
For me, its use is rewards and having a safety buffer between fraudsters and my bank account. Someone steals my cc info, no big deal. Call visa concierge and they sort it out and mail me a new card. Fraud with a debit card? It will probably get sorted eventually but the cash is missing from your account until that point. Fraudulent purchases with bitcoin? Oh, too bad. It's gone for good.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:37:36
But what about from the consumers point of view? The store I understand, but I see no incentive for consumers themselves to switch to BTC.
Consumers use chargebacks not only for stolen credit cards, but also for goods and services not delivered as advertised. They would lose this protection

I think that is vastly overestimating the capabilities of autonomous data structures. At some point, a human has to be involved in handling disputes.
My credit card company phoned aeromexico for me about a dozen times earlier this year after aeromexico cancelled my flight and refused to process a refund. Visa kicked their nuts in until they gave it to me.
I don't see how an autonomous system could come anywhere close to that...
But maybe that's just me.
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:13:56
Ask yourself if the average buyer is buying because FOMO or because they understand the technology.
I don't doubt that blockchain is revolutionary. What I am saying is the market is affected FAR more by FOMO than by people who truly understand and believe in the tech.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:49:18
Volatile yes, I am not disagreeing with that.
It's volatile because of the speculation. It got driven to 19k off FOMO not because the technology is worth that.
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:31:54
In 10 years time maybe yes. But there are people arguing that BTC is better inherently, and as of now.

Yeah except theres probably tens of millions of people itching to smoke weed and maybe like the 10k if that who are nerding out about paying taxes with bitcoin.

The real problem IMO is that people in the cryptocurrency sphere, especially bitcoin, endlessly tout its decentralized, noncontrollable nature as a feature.
The problem is that the very fact that it is decentralized is what will prevent it from ever going mainstream. A decentralized crypto can never offer the type of consumer protections that people currently expect through their credit cards and debit cards. These will be an absolute requirement for mass adoption.
My prediction is that blockchain is here to stay, but the implementation that "takes off" is going to be one that is centralized and backed by either big banks or the government, maybe both. The bitcoin experiment will fail with time.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:43:02
Sounds like a recipe for bankruptcy.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:20:56
And its not going to disrupt anything, even debit cards, until its quick and easy enough that people's grandmas can understand and use it independently. And until using it comes with the same protections people are accustomed to with fiat.
Until bitcoin reaches that point, mass adoption will never occur.
Having to worry about wallets, how you store your coins, where you store your coins, what exchange to use, no protections if hacked, transaction fees and speed, etc. Its just above peoples heads.
I frankly dont see it happening. Im fairly confident that blockchain will be adopted in some form by either the banks or the government, but bitcoin itself will never fill the space needed for mass adoption.

When you use a credit card you dont pay for fraud losses. Thats the point.

Store of value wont be feasible unless volatility reduces drastically... but I could see it happening some day after bitcoin "settles in".
However, in my opinion for bitcoin to have any value as a store of value, it needs to have some kind of practical application too.

It is not more efficient for the consumer. Credit cards (and debit cards to a lesser degree) have significant built in protections. Fraud with a credit card? No big deal, dispute the transactions and let visa sort it out. My balance is never effected. On a debit card, itll affect your balance for a bit but probably eventually get resolved.
With bitcoin... you would be shit out of luck. Good luck convincing consumers that significantly less protections than even a debit card offers is a convenience. 
Many people use credit cards simply as a buffer between fraud and their bank account. That is, even though there's an extra step involves in paying off the cc, they accept that because of the extra protections it provides.

1 BTC = 1/21,000,000 of human savings *only* if BTC gains enough utility and acceptance (the two go hand in hand, to be sure) that every human recognizes BTC as the optimal platform for their savings.
I don't personally believe that day will ever come.

Also having a degree significantly assists in mobility in life. You more or less cant emigrate to another country without at minimum a bachelors degree, for example.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:34:04




@_date: 2018-03-09 17:55:28
But even if it reaches that point, it won't have the kinds of protections a simple credit card offers. Fraudulent transaction? I just tell VISA and its handled. It never even affected my balance. 
And reward points? I just paid for a flight to switzerland with points I earned off my every day purchases.
I think until Crypto can offer the whole package - the protections, benefits, and simplicity that people are already accustomed to, it will never be mass adopted.

Shit like this is why to the average end consumer who has way less tech savvy than even this OP who cocked up and lost access to a million dollars, total decentralization is not necessary a plus. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:53:59
Of course, the other component of this is that market adoption of a currency is driven by the consumer, rather than the business.
IMO, bitcoin will never be adopted since centralization, despite being made out to be the evil voodoo man, is something the end user prefers. Centralization offers:
 * a buffer between the pay method and their bank balance. Someone hacks your CC, just call the credit card company and its sorted in 30 minutes.
* points - pretty self explainatory
* consumer protections including the ability dispute both fraudulent transactions and shitty businesses. For example, Aeromexico flat refused me a refund after they cancelled my flight. A centralized agency like Visa was able to call Aeromexico and batter them into giving me a refund.
 Etc etc...
I could be wrong, but I dont personally see how something decentralized like BTC can ever do the above. Until it does.... little to no reason for the consumer to switch. Frankly I think the average consumer even cares about decentralization otherwise... so there has to be something else to entice them.
Anyhow, just my 2 cents..
