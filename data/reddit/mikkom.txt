Too bad there is no real way of shorting bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-11-29 08:21:20
Of course you can short Bitcoin: 
In fact my humble opinion is that this ability to short with real market instruments is one of the reasons why bitcoin is down as much as it is.

Probably at some actual prop trading firms. They love taking opposite side than the amateurs. 
And now there are actual contracts with minimal counterparty risk (futures). I still don't think many people understand how large impact the regulated Bitcoin market that allows larger players to enter with minimized counterparty risk has.
hint from CBOE site: "CFE launched trading in Cboe bitcoin futures on December 10 under the ticker symbol "XBT"
Look at the chart from there and remember that big players usually accumulate positions.

I have been looking the whole Bitcoin market fall from sidelines and I think I'll finally post a comment and hope that someone will learn something.
First giant hint: Do not take advice from random internet dudes or dudettes especially if they have biases like holdings in bitcoin, there are psychological aspects in play so the recommendations are not neutral.
Yes, I'm just another random internet dude (with over 20 years of trading experience) so I don't tell what to do but I'll post something about the markets.
You should not mix recommendations from one market to other markets. Bitcoin market is NOT the same as the stock market. Neither is FX for example. There are very fundamental differences that should be considered by anyone trading the markets.
Microstructures are different for different markets but things like stop cascades (which most people trading bitcoin probably don't understand at all but which are highly relevant) can clearly be seen from the price changes.
Help yourself and read this: 
If the trend is down (or even neutral) you are not buying dips. Buying dips is relevant when there is either short or long term positive trend. With stock indices buying dips is almost always a good idea even if there is pain at the short term as western economic system requires economic growth. So if the stock market wouldn't recover in long term, that would mean that the whole economic system would fall. And at that point there are much larger things to consider like large scale riots and so on than your stock portfolio.
Something to consider: 
Hope this helps someone save their money.

You can do the same with USD or euro much easier..
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:38:56
No, it's exactly the opposite. See the links provided.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:50:54
You never know with this sub....
I still hope the post helps someone.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:22:14
Exactly the reaction I thought I would get :-) It's strange how some people actually want to lose money.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:03:04
You are probably refering to hyperinflation there?
How is Bitcoin that is highly volatile and falling rapidly better hedge than some basket ETF or simply buying some stocks, gold, silver, USD or euro?

Keeping each transaction in the blockchain is fundamental to the whole blockchain idea and to the Bitcoin. There is no way around it unless you want to centralize some aspects of the protocol. And if there are centralized aspects then the whole blockchain is no different than for example banking system which is also decentralized but centralized on some parts.


My first computer was C64 :-) So I totally understand whay you talk about. Actually I think my first HDD was also on my third computer (Had to get PC to play Ultima VI)
As you state what is relevant to the future of the bitcoin and blockchain as technology for financial global transactions (ie. money) is what the growth rate of the blockchain (and required electricity for mining, I actually don't think bandwidth will be the bottleneck) would be for the specific problem area we are talking about. And my humble guess is that for money the comparison to real world electricity gerneration and typical storage size increase the ratio would be extremely unfeasible.
As you have probably more interested in bitcoin in generatl than me, have you seen any calculations/studies about these?
I'm actually quite suprised people are not talking about this more as IMHO this is as fundamental as it gets and it is also the reason why I myself would never, ever invest in Bitcoin long term.
edit: Actually now as I think about this, transaction count would probably not increase after some point (100% of global transactions) so at some point the transaction count would actually be feasible.. something to think about for myself too.
This is a great post about this:
which states "This transaction volume would generate about 350 gigabytes on the blockchain every day, or 127 terabytes every year."

Have you specified the risk you are willing to take? What is the plan for risk management when risk is realized?
If you can't answer that then you are gambling..
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:10:29
That is not true. That is why I posted the links to the reports. 
From the both reports it can be seen that "small speculators" have been on long-side for the whole time the instruments have existed and "large speculators" and "commercials" have been on short side.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:27:40
How is this relevant to this post at all?
You think it's better to trade a market you know nothing about? Do you also like to drive a car with a sack over your head?
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:33:21
Who are the people who actually *need* bitcoin? Please enlighten me
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:05:52


Thanks for your response - this is getting kind of off-topic from the post but who cares..
I think the ideals for bitcoin are great but the technical implementation will not work something as large-scale as money. For smaller size ledgers that work in no-trust environments maybe but not for money.
I'm quite technical guy and I just don't understand how keeping the whole history of each coin that has changed hands in some distant past can be technically feasible. At the end of 2017 the blockchain was 149GB and this is pre-wide adoption. 
It would be really interesting to see a simulation for estimated size growth for blockchain if the Bitcoin would be used as a real-world currency. To be technically feasible the growth rate should be much less than what is the growth rate of typical HDD size as otherwise the blockchain will at point X be larger than any medium it can be stored to.
I do like the ideals behind the bitcoin but do not think it will succeed in its current form at least.
