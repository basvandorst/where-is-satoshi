I would argue that it's more of being lazy versus protecting their own ass. If OP is being honest that it was a tx from 7 months ago that he had no idea where that btc would go afterwards then Coinbase should clearly see that in the blockchain. Really they have an address that may have been flagged and instead of being loyal to their customer base and defending that unfortunate circumstance ,which is going to happen a lot if they continue to play that game, they'll lose a majority of their customer by mass punishment style actions. 
They lose enough customers they lose their company. Also with Circle on the come up you'd think they'd want to fight for their customers who have 1 tx from 7 months ago and they cancel his account. I understand following rules and regulations but Coinbase is becoming a corporate btc company now and not caring about the little guys and more for the big companies they're supporting. You can't hold OP responsible for where that money goes after it leaves his wallet from the first tx. Coinbase could fight that and clearly win the case but instead they're just taking the easy way out and will begin to lose a lot more customers in the future.

Why do people actually use Gox? To me it's been the worst exchange out there. Not to mention their super inflated BTC price.

Electrum was the one I recall hearing about. I completely agree and understand about not wanting coins to go missing but with electrum you should be able to add that wallet.dat file in there to work correct? 
I remember someone stating that but I'm not sure if others have actually done it. I'm definitely afraid of losing coins. But even if I pulled all coins and noticed I was missing some couldn't I still update the BTC-QT wallet and it'd show the other coins?

I personally think this has a lot to do with it. As you started to see and hear about USD was increasing in value versus other currencies the price of BTC=USD value started decreasing. Along with the stock market which is killing it right now. 
A bunch of the commodities have fallen this year. Whether we like it or not there is a direct correlation. 
Either way I'll continue to buy as I'm a believer and putting what I can lose if something terrible happens.

So would it be wise to transfer from Coinbase to Bittrex or to my electrum wallet. Now that Bittrex supports both I'm thinking that's the wiser option.

The Bitcoin folder is not where everyone keeps saying it is so I can't copy anything in there. As well there is no Bitcoin folder in my backup from time machine so I'm not exactly sure how to locate the backup either.

Would you happen to know where I could find the bitcoin folder to find the possible backup? I think I have one saved at another location but just in case I want to make sure I can locate the bitcoin folder. Also do I let the wallet sync the blockchain then restore from my backup after it's synced?

Ok you telling me that they have over 250K users but only 6 employees. That doesn't speak well for a company wanting to expand. Out of the 6 employees how many of them are customer service? 2 so you possibly have 2 employees answering emails and service requests because coinbase has issues that need to be dealt with. I am level 2 verified and I get listed as high risk. Whats the point of having a verification process if you can't even purchase BTC because they say your high risk. I've never had an issue with the money being withdrawn from my bank. Also whats the point of having a instant purchase setting anymore if you buy coins and they still aren't in an account after 8 hours? So yes they might be really easy to use but since Ive been using them they have slowly proved to be a shitty exchange.

Thanks just downloaded Electrum. I'll see how I like it. Having to sync the blockchain does suck.

the backup.dat was in my external hardrive. So I was able to locate the folder it was just hidden. I recall now that Apple does this and thanks to they helped point me into the right direction. I eventually located the hidden files exactly where everyone was telling me they were. Once found I entered into time machine copied those files and deleted the new ones and replaced them all. Opened Bitcoin-QT and it started to sync my old wallet. I am very thankful for everyones help.

Do you know if there is a way to pull my old blockchain and addresses to use them through Electrum? That is if I find my backup file.

I was thinking about this the other day. I was wanting one to have to show the purchase amount of BTC then the purchase of my stocks. So it'd have to be able to keep track of the BTC price and the amount my stocks are worth and then another column showing how much I'm up or down with the cost of the stocks and the price of the btc. If my stock prices go down but btc goes up I'm not as down as I would think or vice versa.

Well to start they cancelled an order the other day stating my account was considered "High Risk" but no explanation as of why it was considered it and stated hopefully I'd have better luck in a few weeks. I have just recently just purchased more coins from my weekly instant which stated they'd be delivered at a certain time and they haven't been. I have previously talked with someone I believe as Jeff who mentioned the first part about high risk and better luck in a few weeks. I believe the second contact was with Olaf but he never replied back after stating my account had been switched back off of high risk. So honestly they might be a small company but they're customer service isn't really doing much to help people out so why not go to someone who can actually get something done.

Can I get an invite please?

There was no Bitcoin folder in my App Support section on the time machine or in the new folder as well. So not sure where else to find it?
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:17:33
Thanks yeah I'm gonna start doing backups to separate locations.

I used Bitcoin-QT as my wallet on my computer. I have tried searching and nothing comes up with a wallet.dat file. The only file I can find is Bitcoin-QT Backup.dat file but it wasn't saved in the time machine.
