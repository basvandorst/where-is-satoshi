I'm sure the whole thing was a creation to just pull out some cash without spending anything. I mean, you have 1k bitcoin, you split the network, you also get 1k bcash and you just sell the bcash without spending any bitcoin. Free money to pay for jihan's electricity for the next month when he will not be able to asicboost.

Or maybe Satoshi is actually John Titor. The time when he was "discovered" to be some lawyer from Florida coincides with the release of Bitcoin(2009).

Well, in let's say 5 years, maybe bitmain will own 100% of meaningful hardware that can spit blocks, and he makes a hardcode in them to not accept satoshi's wallet transactions...how is that being called "censorship-resistant"?

Well apparently nobody asked before "what if one guy controls the manufacturing of 90% of mining hardware and keeps the good ones for himself and his friends" :D

From what i know, the initial design price of a chip is very expensive and gets lower only with multiple prints. So the 1milionth printed chip is cheaper than the first one, considering you split the r&amp;d cost to all the chips printed for you. So this is certainly a risk to start developing asics. Also, depending on the chip manufacturing process you have to account for failed prints. Some have a higher rate of fails than others(the recent AMD Ryzen process is very productive with very few fails).
Now, in my opinion, when Bitmain released their good Asics, investors decided it would be cheaper to buy and build whole farms from Bitmain, rather than R&amp;D-ing it themselves and it evolved from there with blackmails and central authorities...

As it has been stated and explained in the SIA Asic Launch, the more expensive the hardware is, and the more hashrate your network has, the safer it becomes, as the risk of a 51% attack becomes too costly. That would be the reason why GPU's would not really be that great for a long run. In my opinion, what we should do, is try to get CPU makers and Asic makers to come and join this business. I wouldn't mind buying an Asic from AMD or from Samsung or IBM, rather than Bitmain...
Maybe create some Small Form factor Asic arrays so you can get into this slowly, with 300$ devices. Now that would be a great idea! Make them modular, allow people to buy more and attach them in series, on the same power source. Be smart and bring inovation!

I know, that 2.5$ transaction fee was for moving everything onto electrum

Perfectly described, but even if Bitmain only owns Antpool, i was referring just to the devices themselves, where they own a lot more. And they are pointed to other pools, yes, but you never know what will happen with let's say Antminer 12. It might have a backdoor or anything like that, and when there is a vote for fork or anything, he just points all of them to whatever he wants/needs, and you would never know(or it would be too late). 
Also, i am sure he has deals towards his friends and farms. As i said earlier, chips become less expensive the more you print, but you do not see their miners getting any cheaper on their website. At the same time one of his friend's chinese farms gets the miners for half the price with the condition of doing whatever he says and pointing them to where he wants. 
Might not be "he", might be "them", but i wouldn't be sure of that...
But i hope somebody will come soon with 10nm chips and bring Bitmain to shambles as they will most likely not be able to keep up...

Blockchain ---------------
Hard Fork -----======(if one gets absorbed by the other it becomes ----- again)
Bitmain is a manufacturer of Asics.
Asic =  Application Specific Integrated Circuit = A system of logical units that are meant to do one thing(mine bitcoin in this case)
BIP148 = Bitcoin Improvement proposal |  a proposed consensus agreement for bitcoin to become faster when dealing with transactions(right now, if you set a low fee, you can wait even 24h until it gets accepted in the block) by implementing SegWit into the Blockchain. It is done by "voting". You can read more here: 
SegWit = Segregated Witness | a lot of technological improvements. You can read more about them here 
CPU = Central processing unit. The brain of any computer and smartphone. Computes the operating system, the apps that you start, the browser, every movement of the mouse and so on. Used to be able to mine bitcoin in the very beginning, now there's very few coins where it is profitable, and only with high-end CPU's(Ryzen 7)
GPU = Graphics Processing Unit(A cpu, that does a specific job, but is better at it) = A video card used in computers to render the image on your screen by doing a lot of mathematical operations. Can be used to mine bitcoins(not profitable anymore because of ASICs^(see above) and altcoins(very profitable right now, but with a 50-100 day return of investment. Also, most of the good GPU's for mining are gone and there is a worldwide shortage of them) .

Buy some Bugattis, sell them for cash...
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:20:52
My question would be in case of a Hard Fork, with Bitmain who owns most of the miners and has the biggest ASIC production, how will the BIP148 fork mine if Bitmain will not release anymore asics for BIP148 and segwit? Will the difficulty decrease, because of less blocks being mined and we can go back to GPU's and CPU's?..
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:38:52
Man, i don't even care if it's GPU or Asic mining. What i really dislike is that We get a release of, let's call it Asic-9. It's cool and all, brings you a lot of BTC and you will have a ROi of 120 days for it. In those 120 days, you already have to compete with Asic-11 which is unreleased to the public and the same vendor uses it in their mining farm and with Chinese that have access to Asic-10 while you are stuck with 9, so in order to keep up, when after 70 days you see your ROi going towards 150 now, you decide to buy the freshly released worldwide Asic-10, but Chinese are on 11 now and the company's farm is going for 12. 
During this whole thing you will just invest in Asics that have to run for years to bring you profits and with no way to sell them second-hand as nobody would want something that is not even a quarter as good as the current generation for half the price. So the only winners are the ones making the Asics.
As for GPU's, they are not rushed to the market(shortage), improvements are in the order of 5-15%/generation(1.5 years) so it's not a massive increase, which makes everything stable. and their price is not out of this galaxy, while also allowing you to buy them in batches or even one by one, and add them in steps, while you cannot buy "half-an-asic". Now, i'm not advocating for GPUs or anything, just trying to explain (on teh basic level of my understanding) why the chinese Asic makers don't want SegWit.

Altcoins, shapeshift, beginner at mining, etc...Worst part about it was taht it wouldn't back up or give me the private keys until i received funds on it for the first time, but i was already mining towards their address so i was stuck with it. Glad i educated myself in the meantime :D

Day trading.
 If you look at the history of the median price of bitcoin in 10-15 min segments over the past week, you will see that it follows a sinusoidal patter(going up, then down then up again) with an increasing trend(as an average, when it goes up again, it goes higher). 
Now, the basics of making money is to buy when it is at it's low peak(you have to look at prices live and buy as soon as they start to go up) then you mark down the price with which you bought them. 
You wait for the next peak to start falling down and you sell as soon as it starts going down.(this is the part where people, seeing as it goes down, try to sell their coins, as it happens really fast, people have to sell for less and less and if you barely manage to sell at 2650 and you bought with 2500 it is not much of a profit, but as there is always a chance of it going down for good, people do it because of a phenomenon called **panic selling**). 
The closer you are to the peaks when you trade, the more profit you have.
[Edit]I don't think it was one big sell as the amounts varried too much and the prices were fluctuating a lot...i know it happened on poloniex and bittrex..

If you use soft wallets you cannot set it manually, sadly. And they just use the average fee for the 0-5 blocks transactions. So yes, fees are still high...(in my case exodus used 2.5$ for a transaction, good riddance!)
