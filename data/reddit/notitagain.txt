Sure, that logic would be applicable to a coin like litecoin that was not designed out of malice or ill intent. But BCH; Bitcoin ABC or whatever you want to call it was created as a power move to centralize things. It seems as though people have forgotten the rhetoric that surrounded bch before the fork. Ver excluded there was a lot of FUD about the core dev team being compared to nazis because of their fixes for bitcoin. And forcing segwit down peoples throats with the bip-148 fix for mandatory segwit adoption.

This is just hilarious, they are trying so hard. They are like the desperate ex-girlfriend that keeps calling you and leaving messages even though you never call her back.

all he wants is the end of reasonable people and communities, and have a bitcoin that is focused on profit only. That is the true point of bch in the long term is profit and centralization. As long as you hold stake in the centralization of bitcoin you hold stake in bch.

I personally do not think that bch should grow, because the reason for its existence is to attempt to extinguish the existence of bitcoin. It's frankly an attempt at a hash power mutiny, and dangerous for that reason. Bitcoin was unique when it was designed in that it removed the need of a trusted third party to confirm transactions, bitcoin cash is a copy that was a response to forward progress in the development and scalability of the system. Overall, it has no true value in the system other than to be a profit engine for people like ver.
