And what exactly didn't make sense there? I know it's tough when you used up your entire vocabulary in this thread, but I'll try and talk you through it
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:53:05
Haha. I'm glad someone enjoys it. 
Save your money. Sadly we're all going to need all our pennies soon enough

What fucking advice do you want? It's a volatile currency.  It's not like investing in GOOG, AAPL, GM, any of those big fucking names where the moves are going to be +/- 1% on a daily basis.
If you want some fucking advice, go read a blog, a news article, don't rely on other people to do the leg work for you, because if they do, and they're wrong, I can guarantee you'd be back in here bitching and moaning about "how you got the wrong advice".
We don't have Magic 8 balls here kid, do your own due diligence and stop acting like a faggot.

If you've got the 4000 points card, I'll spot you the loan you need
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:49:52
THEN WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU ASKING ASININE QUESTIONS LIKE THESE.
YOU BELIEVE, THEN INVEST YOUR FUCKING MONEY.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:58:50
Take my bet then chicken shit
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:06:51
Oh that's just adorable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:57:09
Don't you fucking dare tell me to chill.  Fucking stupid ass kids coming on here looking for advice, and then they get upset when they're called out.
Fuck you
Oh, I just watched 30 seconds of your fucking Minecraft videos, and I just wanted to say, without reservations, that your mother should have aborted you
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:41:09
Really? I didn't respond for 5 minutes and you think I'm backing out.  Fuck you faggot.
Oh prices sure are rebounding for you.  You're at $125 now, I'm quivering in my boots.
Like I said, if by some chance I lose this bet, it won't be a bad month for me, fuck it won't even be a bad week.  I'll just have to tell the wife we can't go out to eat for a couple nights, I'm sure she'll be fucking devastated. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:59:47
Yeahhh.  No it's not
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:58:37
Got nothing huh?
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:55:08
Oh thank god. That must mean all the problems with the system are solved and it's nothing but blue skies and green pastures. 
I'll make you a bet, we'll hit $50 before we hit $200 again. I'll bet 3 coins. You man enough to take that bet? 
Fuck you OP
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:39:15
Kinda like a 15 year old kid giving back ~$60,000.
The exact same amount that another user did.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:14:01
You're fucking retarded

How is that fucking funny?

Just because you were so honest and forthright

@_date: 2013-04-13 01:24:46
And just to clarify, because I don't want you bitching like a faggot when you lose, we're going off the mtgoxUSD exchange.  That's what I've been quoting, and I'm pretty sure you as well
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:58:13
Why? I know I'm never going to collect from you anyway when I win. You're going to be long fucking gone, cowering with your tail between your legs
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:50:41
Sorry, too soon again.  $116
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:40:28
I was offering to give you the loan, I have no idea about the moderators
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:46:51
Hey man, it's been 12 minutes, you're not pussying out, are you?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:07:59
Fine, since you're going to be a little child and bitch and moan, mine is 1ADKzZ6MpiCAbKRhxyp5CsfJZvDMkFhPCZ.  See you when it hits $50

@_date: 2013-04-13 00:42:34
Yeah, I have the coins to cover it, and then some.  In fact, those 6 bitcoins were going to be a gift for my maid, but fuck, I'd much rather give yours to her instead
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:20:56
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:13:43
I'm not betting against my success.  You have no idea what my base price on my coins are.
Regardless, I'll be around these boards no matter what.  I'll keep an eye out for you when the shit hits the fan again and you're shitting yourself like you more than likely did all this week
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:48:07
I'll sell mine for $250.  Interested?
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:02:44
You've got a deal
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:01:50
Hahahaha.  Just admit you made an idiotic statement and you were wrong.
It's that simple
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:01:40
I really hope you do invest, get a nice chunk of money in Bitcoins, and then the fucking bottom just falls out.  Nothing would make me happier than knowing you lost a shit ton of money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:50:51
Congrats.  Just know you're going to be sending that over to me in a couple days.  How's that feel?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:17:38
Like I said, the $1200 was going to our maid anyway, I've already written it off in my mind.
I'm not the kind to jew out on a bet.  If you win, you'll get your 6 at $200
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:54:41
Yeah it's too bad, but he's gone like a little bitch.  I was looking forward to giving my winnings to my maid
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:00:48
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:50:06
Nope.  I'm a smart investor
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:14:58
Shut the fuck up
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:52:54


Au contraire, I think it is you who is the idiot.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:00:22
No fucking shit it could go either way. You must be so smart. Did you study economics?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:45:01
Oops, I misspoke.  $119 now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:06:14
I wish your mother would have swallowed you
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:03:33


Or is that your way of saying don't cure?
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:08:30
Good job with that math too. Let me double check your numbers though.
6 * 200 = $1,200.
Good job OP
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:44:00
You're so original.

Have any proof?
I just bought a million worth of bitcoins. AMA
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:04:02
I'll come looking for you when prices plunge like a fucking rock through that $50 threshold
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:00:32
Honestly, with the uncertainty in the major trading firms, the significant pullback in gold and commodities today, the strengthening of the USD vs the Euro and Yen, and the situation in Cyprus figuring itself out, I see it getting back down into the low teens within a month.
This was panic buying, plain and simple.  There was no true justification for it, and if I'm wrong and we do see another rapid increase in prices, it's just going to get slapped back down by the DDoS, Government, whatever you want to attribute it too
I've been in the game a long time now.  I remember mining back when it was easy and barely taxed my computer, and I'd love to retire on my earnings, but sadly I'm a realist, and this was the dot com bubble all over again, just much faster
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:20:27
I upvoted your thread, start with me.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:04:43
How you feeling about our little bet? Lots and lots of weakness down to that $50 handle
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:24:36
Hold on, let me check my magic fucking 8 ball
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:09:24
No one fucking cares. Do it, don't do it, but stop making these stupid fucking posts
If you believe in it, like you say you do, you won't need the assurance and approval of random strangers on the internet.
 &gt;Rumors say it could go to 15..! I know it will eventually go back up to at least 200
You're a fucking idiot
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:07:24
Big talk for a brand new account.  I can almost guarantee when prices are bottoming out around $15 or so, you'll be long gone.
And if, by some stretch of bad luck that the price does hit $200, I'll be so filthy rich that I'll be more than happy to help out someone on hard times.

Yeah well I want to buy a Ferrari for $35,000.  Looks like we're both shit out of luck
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:47:48


Yes, you fucking idiot.  They called it a "flash crash"
