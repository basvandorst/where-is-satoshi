Thanks for addressing this issue. Some key posts from yesterday that would normally make it to the top were quickly buried.
@_date: 2016-03-19 12:47:52
As if reddit even fucking matters.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:46:07
Roger ver and his crappy site are enemies of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-20 14:21:57
Nice troll bait.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:45:09
People are getting sick of the classic shill brigades. Hard to blame them. Almost all posts are dictated to whether they make the top post or are suppressed with negative votes by classic bots (can be taken 2 ways) and their brigades. I'm here for the long haul though. We will get back to normal and even better.

Crazy how when you look at the attack and that other sub it lines up with what the green beret said to the T. 
If I had a uBTC for everytime one of those people in /rbtc try to use "satoshi vision" for leverage I would be a whale by now.
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:00:41
Useless. Classicers no doubt spent their time manipulating results/votes as they usually do.
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:00:37
Don't use coinbase.
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:35:42
Repeatedly pump for contentious hard forks. Should question their integrity. Trade on Gemini or Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-03-22 01:44:13
Or maybe there would be much less if they didn't. Do you think at all?
@_date: 2016-03-20 23:38:07
There was a post on this sub too. That there is not a case of "noticing". It's a case of causing the problem and then attacking from another direction. Also, nice 1 post account ....almost sounds like a bot created account.
Edit: nice edit. Wont get you your desired credibility.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:30:23
They aren't a wallet. And don't use coinbase.
@_date: 2016-03-22 02:10:41
Wow. Post history on those sure do make it seem so. Great find.

Have some fucking respect for those putting in constant work to bitcoin. I doubt you have done *anything* troll.
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:13:50
Fair enough. Hard to tell these days.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:45:08
Makes a strong case for bitcoin as well as monero.
@_date: 2016-03-20 08:56:25
I heard the eth dictator is speaking at coinbase next week or something. Hmm...
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:17:27
If this thread is going to be suppressed by brigaders then it deserves to be reposted every 12 hours.
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:57:44
If you think so (i disagree) then use Electrum or other spv client. Using coinbase as a wallet is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2016-03-19 19:07:51
You won't unite the community because it's a dangerous idea only fools would support.
@_date: 2016-03-20 02:58:54
This won't be brigaded. No, not at all.
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:16:09
Why move from the best wallet to a web based exchange? Coinbase is not a wallet. Bad idea.
@_date: 2016-03-18 23:59:33
Check what kind if fee you need or get a wallet that does it for you. Nothing needs fixed.
@_date: 2016-03-19 12:46:14
Reddit account pruning. Nice try.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:30:46
RIP eth for a 2nd time in a week. Although I suspect the anti bitcoin attackers will continue to pump/prop up at least until btc breaks up to keep up the fear peddling.
@_date: 2016-03-19 03:11:11
Boycott Conbase.
@_date: 2016-03-18 12:57:55
No. Spamming every crypto user on every crypto sub for weeks on end pumping a premined ipo shitcoin is disgusting.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:41:20
1 reddit post. New account. Must be another concern troll.
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:09:48
Concern troll.
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:03:50
If you hate bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:46:35
Like from yourself.
@_date: 2016-03-20 08:46:27


Stop making things up.
