I know that, but what about now? where the assurance bitcoin will be widely accepted?

Most places in asia accept the Yen

And these stores fall into exactly the same situation i was talking about. Who are  they going to sell these bitcoins to?

Answering my question with another one dosen't help. Also, the USD was originally tied to gold and other valuable minerals. The Peso and Euro and Lira have value because they were made by governments agreeing to them being currency. banks only accept recognized currencies, same thing with most shops. Until the governments or shops allow people to buy with bitcoin, it wont have any value

But you can exchange these currencies for each other legally and also  im not too sure, but dont debit / electronic payments cards auto convert?

That's the dark net, Not most shops is it? Most grocery stores / online shops wont accept bitcoin. I know there a few in Prague and Singapore but most shops accept currencies like the USD, etc

Dont cherry pick, i said MOST PLACES DONT ACCEPT IT. you wont see your local supermarket or corner shop accepting bitcoin

Dude i'm talking about currencies not everything, I specifically was talking in the context of currencies.They also have value because governments agree that they can be used in shops, etc. What i meant was that how will these companies that buy bitcoin make money if it can't be used in most shops?

Censorship resistance???
By widely accepted i meant that most normal people will completely replace dollars with it. other wise in the end, even if everyone uses it, they will still convert it to dollars. this question was asking what will bitcoin exchange companies do with the excess they have

Wut? I just wanted to know how they're going to make actual currency like USD back, No need for sarcasm

Ok then, that's part of my questions answered. We could have avoided all of this and you could have just answered that part. But who will the big companies sell to? they are the ones issuing the gift cards, they've got to make they money back
