You can't copy my cat, you can't copy bitcoin. If I paid for those bitcoin (the cat) it is mine. If you open my wallet with the copied private key (door key) and peer into it (my house) you haven't stolen anything. The minute you transfer my bitcoin (cat) out of my wallet (house) it is theft. You cannot copy bitcoins (cats).

I understand what you are saying, and it still doesn't matter if there are a thousand copies of my keys scattered across all the crooks in the world. If the coins aren't moved, I still have control, however sketchy it may be. Once they move to a knew wallet by someone other than myself, they are absolutely stolen because they cannot be copied or replicated.

Okay in this respect I think I see.
This is not unlike printing fiat. Making copies of my dollar lowers my dollars value. This is a form of theft (undermining?). However, I also think the line becomes blurred when dealing with abstractions like "stealing an idea", like "If I mince a cow and cook it, I can make hamburgers." Am I supposed to wait for you to finally make a burger for me to purchase? Or can I just make my own burger? Is that theft? And what if we both have the idea to make burgers at once?
I'm going off topic, but I understand your point.

Not saying it's right or wrong, but copying data is not the same as theft and should not be treated the same. Stealing a USB and copy-pasting a USB so that there are now two sets of files are not the same things. If there is a crime being committed, it is not theft.

Niko is partly right. I'm a geochemist researching ore deposit formation mechanisms. When doing research, you have to take educated guesses on what the reality of your situation is and then prove or disprove, and revise your educated guess from there. A good researcher doesn't let their pride dictate the conclusions of their research, though this does happen. I don't see this occurring quite as much in the field of geology, I think because it is smaller than say astrophysics and your work is more intimately scrutinized by people you personally know.
Noosterdam (below) is right as well, many people research hot topics for the buzz of fame or the money that comes with it, however most of us are in it for personal growth and true curiosity of nature. Unfortunately, research costs money and researchers have to eat, and while there are topics I would much rather dedicate my life to, I am researching ore deposits because it is what pays the bills (not that I don't enjoy it) and it was the best decision financially for me at this point in my life.
I hear a lot of shit talk about academics, but at least in the geology departments and places that I have worked I have only encountered a majorly honest and genuine research community.

Oh yeah, I forgot they did away with transaction fees.
Still, the point is promote bitcoin adoption by providing evidence that people want to use it, by actually using bitcoin. This allows the company to learn about bitcoin and how it fits into their business with a hands-on approach, letting them test out the shallow end of bitcoin, and hopefully encouraging them to develop a full blow bitcoin business model.
Personally, I spend bitcoins to promote bitcoin, not necessarily to save money. The universal bitcoin discounts, I think, will arrive when there is more widespread understanding of its utility in comparison to credit cards and the like.

Though I don't understand how stating a fact, then making a passive suggestion, "Detach your money from politics; discover decentralized currency.", is a bad thing. If this message incites curiosity of the possibilities of decentralized currency in only one individual, then the ridicule will have been worth it.
The message presented on these bills and the knowledge to be gained from researching decentralized currency have little to do with the volatility or the lack of services that accept bitcoin, or any other currency for that matter.
Is it because it is written on a dollar bill?

I think the majority of businesses that accept bitcoin are internet and software based, however there are also many small online stores that accept bitcoin (I personally have bought coffee, laser components, and those alpaca socks) with a large range of products.
Also there are larger companies such as Overstock, Newegg, TigerDirect, and Dell, that accept bitcoin for physical items (computer components, household items, clothing, etc.). 
There are plenty of places out there, check out [this article]( It's almost a year old article, so keep that in mind.

I think the point is to prove that bitcoin owners want to use bitcoin, and not fiat. 
I realize this way of doing business is convoluted, but if more people buy with bitcoin (via BitPay), the seller will eventually realize they could save that 1% fee if they started taking bitcoin payments directly, and if they started taking bitcoin payments directly, they may become inclined to start using bitcoin themselves.
Otherwise all you have are people asking businesses to accept bitcoin, and their response would be, "Why? No one is even spending bitcoin anyway."
Making purchases in the manner described by OP, in my mind, is concrete evidence that bitcoin works and bitcoin users want to do business this way. If the business realizes this, they will eventually implement their own payment system, and hopefully will start incorporating bitcoin in their business model.
@_date: 2014-10-02 04:08:37
I believe if you took the spending habits of bitcoiners and applied them to the majority of consumers, it would absolutely increase the growth of product quality, in the sense of better common products, and newer products that weren't available before. 
Bitcoiners need to spend money. Not everyone is only investing "what they can afford". I use bitcoin as money when I can, as often as I can. I have bitcoin savings, as well as fiat savings. I also have a day-to-day bitcoin wallet, just like a fiat wallet. I exchange fiat to btc on the reg, so I actually have a positive impact, even though I'm constantly using bitcoin, currently at a much lower rate than fiat..

I don't think hoarding is a problem. Assuming you had 10,000btc, you wouldn't sell them all at once (crashing the price) because each coin you sold would lose more and more value. The incentive is to sell them (or use them) slowly over a stretched out period of time to get the most value out of your coins.
That said, they didn't really give a good answer, but there's really not an answer to hoarding other than theories of what those hoarders might do, or switching to a different coin altogether.

I don't see why it would be a crash. Assuming MtGox did return the coins, I don't think they would function as an exchange. So people would move their funds offline or to another, trustworthy, exchange. There might be a dip, but I wouldn't call it a crash. I can't imagine the return of any of the lost coins could be anything less than a net positive for the value of bitcoin in the long term.

I love thinking about a future where cryptocurrencies are the norm, and general world power follows suit and becomes more and more decentralized.
My personal favorite consequence of mass adoption of something like bitcoin is that mass warfare (and hopefully warfare in general) will become more and more difficult to fund and perpetuate as people gain more control over their wealth. Starve the war machines and humanity will grow and prosper.
This is along the lines of what I discuss with my friends and family and other newbies to cryptocurrency. It's more than just numbers, it's part of a much larger paradigm shift within the global society. We are in the makings of a very bright future for us and our posterity.
Sorry, I'm getting gushy. Happy Hump Day fellow bitcoiners!

With that said, I think it's time we updated also. The wizard is very immature looking. But I wouldn't want to replace it with some industrial look, or anything that resembles bank icons. I'm a little hypersensitive to ads though. If I know they are trying to appeal to me it causes me to instantly dislike it (e.g. luxury car commercials) and look away.
It should be handsome and subtle, something people would look at and say "Bitcoin? What's that?" and the ad is like "I'm bitcoin. Can I help you?"

Technically the fastest bank to bank transfer available here (assuming you're transferring among different companies) is, I think, a wire transfer. It is almost instant. However, first you have to go to the bank, then you have to fill out paper work, then it may or may not cost you a fee, and you may or may not have to have an account with one of the banks. It is an arduous process compared to "Copy, Paste, Click"
I've never had someone send me money via PayPal, other than paying for an item I was selling, so I do not know how quickly money such as this can enter your bank account. I do know that from the point of sell, it takes days to weeks before I can access my newly paid money.

People do not understand this. Bitcoin and many altcoins are only going to continue upward for the foreseeable future.

The current version of Bitcoin is being updated. Some people want this update, others do not. The result is a split in the hashing power of the network and a new blockchain identical to the old one. The new chain is referred to as Bitcoin2x. If you hold bitcoin before the fork, you will have coins on both chains.

Bitcoin can function like a currency, but it also can function in many other ways.
The point he is trying to make it seems is that the powerful people of the world today are given an unfair advantage, because they make and break the rules as they please. They print and manipulate dollars and euros like a game of Monopoly. Bitcoin presents the opportunity to put and end to that. They can't print more bitcoins and we can make it incredibly difficult (and even impossible) for them to steal our bitcoins. There will still be rich and poor people, he isn't saying there won't be, but this currency evens the playing field and has the potential to end exploitation of the less-powerful.

I imagine the biggest banks will "adopt" cryptos into their business model, but they will never get rid of the cash and hand written ledgers that are so important for fudging the numbers and keeping their actual assets in the dark from the public. People will ask, "why don't you just do all of your business in crypto since it is so secure and verifiable?" And they'll give some bullshit answer about how they can't use crypto for certain aspects of their business model (the illegal aspects) because it's too sensitive. Banks involved in shady shit are going to avoid using cryptos like the plague, because if they had 100% accountability they'd be fucked. Or maybe the Fed would give them Jr. scout badges.

Right. Typically if there is cash found in my wallet in my back pocket, it belongs to me. Having bitcoin on your computer, in your house, likely associated with your online identity, is no different.
And since when is investigating a theft a waste of the police's time? That's what they exist for.
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:28:37
Maybe someone has mentioned elsewhere, but you need to find the addresses your brother used in his wallet. IF he acquired the bitcoin through someone like Coinbase, that should be easily verifiable and that would make a 100% link between those funds and your brother. Then you should start investigating where they went.

Always follow through. I appreciate your positive attitude and persistence. There are a lot of lazy, narcissistic, and sadistic people on the internet that would rather waste their days away telling everyone else what they are doing wrong rather than contribute to the conversation. In all probability Ashton Kutcher won't read this and probably won't do this challenge, but why people want to degrade their fellow humans for making a benign and potentially fruitful suggestion is beyond me. I suppose putting others down on the internet makes them feel big inside.

Most people would do this without even realizing it. If you are comfortable doing those things above, prioritize what you value, and if you think bitcoins are or will be most valuable, buy some!

Like said, JoinMarket is meant for this, but maybe not easily executed at this point.
The "reliable" washers online charge 1-3% generally (total charge).
Other more creative ways are to trade addresses with someone you trust and move those coins to a fresh address, or to send your coins in various amounts to a friend and have them send the same amount back in various amounts (to fresh addresses).
I think that sending coins on and on down a line of HD generated addresses would also give you a desired affect of "lightly washed", i.e. they could still be traced back to your original public address but would be very dissociated with that original address. The issue here is accumulating miner fees depending on how you do it.
If you are not going to use some type of tumbler (washer), things you need to keep in mind are:
* 1) the amounts you are sending (if you send very specific amounts it will make it more traceable; randomize the amounts)
* 2) the timing of your transactions (sending x, y, z,... amounts amounts to a thousand addresses that reunite in 30 minutes is going to look obvious; the more time you take, the better)
* 3) the amount of addresses between your initial address and your final address (sending 1 bitcoin (a very non-unique amount) from A to B is fine, no one can prove you own B, but it will give you greater plausible deniability if you send from A to Z, and mix in random addresses and amounts in between)
Easiest way to break your identity from the coins is to use an HD wallet and send lots of random amounts to multiple addresses, several times over. I also recommend using a VPN or TOR to do the transactions so as not to link your IP address with them.
Anyone can still trace your bits from point A to Z, however it will be more difficult to say with any certainty that you own them.
Anyone that reads this please add information or correct me where I am wrong.

That is exactly why I choose Bitcoin. It allows regular Joe's to opt out of a system that we no longer control.
War is nothing more than the destruction and redistribution of wealth for those who are rich and powerful enough to direct it. Planned warfare, such as U.S. overseas intervention, would not be possible without a strong dollar as a lubricant. The vast majority of people do not want war, and if given the option, would not pay for it. The U.S. has taken total control of the dollar and its people no longer have a voice as to how it should be used. If I could opt out of paying taxes that go towards funding warfare I would, but unless I want Uncle Sam sticking his cold fingers up my ass every year because I do not pay taxes out of protest I cannot.
In our day and age the time has come to where bloated bureaucracies and oligarchies no longer have a leg to stand on and with every passing day socially equalizing technologies such as Bitcoin etch away at the base of their pedestal. Pardon me for speaking passionately, but we have reached a critical mass in the history of humanity where we finally have the tools to unite every single person on the planet, making time and space largely irrelevant, and as more of us begin to realize the tyranny that is imposed upon us in every aspect of life by those in control we will resort to opting out of current systems that leech our livelihoods away in order to maintain centralized control and domination.
I now have an option to support a currency that funds wars, destroying countless lives and endless wealth, and a government that oppresses its people in the name of patriotism, *or* a currency that has little to no ties with warfare and the destruction it brings and allows all of humanity to enter the same playing field.
So a-fucking-men have some **real** freedom, on me.

The original comment was alluding to bitcoin being controlled by middle aged wealthy white guys, and that that was inherently a bad thing. I pointed out otherwise. What point are you trying to make?
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:28:55
The point he was making is that Bitcoin the technology cannot be perverted like a government based currency. The price bobs all over, but that is because of the market and not due to manipulation of the technology.
So what if more than 50% of all bitcoins are owned by a few? It has only been 6 years, and the estimates show we may only have 500,000 bitcoin users. At day 1 100% of all bitcoins were owned by 1 person. The percentage of bitcoin to users ratio has fallen and will fall as time continues and the ecosystem grows. Can we say the same for the American dollar?
Wealthy, middle-age, white males? Yes, let us abandon all up-and-coming technology that may be currently dominated by white men. Gee, I wonder what the demographics of Microsoft and Apple were when they began, oh and I wonder how many people owned 50% of all the Microsoft and Apple computers when they began!

I would like to point out that "There is no more risk to pass on to you," is not accurate. The risk now comes in the form of environmental degradation, long term health problems both physical and mental for both soldiers and civilians involved in the matter, the loss of productivity during recovery, and the recovery of destroyed infrastructure. These are all costs that can be measured in dollars. So to say there is no risk is inaccurate.
Edit: Not to mention the political costs and the degradation of trust between nations.

I was going to suggest using a bitcoin escrow service to just swap coins semi-anonymously, but the only one I know charges 1.5% of whatever deal you make.

That's actually a pretty cool idea. The whole point of bitcoin is that you can do whatever you want with it where ever you want right? The challenge is this: Do the most extreme (but not dangerous) thing you can think of and at the same time do a donation. The more extreme your situation and the more you donate the cooler it is. Some guy records himself donating $100 while skydiving, and it confirms before he even lands. Some guy hanging 2000ft cliffside while climbing donates $200. Some guy with a water proof phone rides a nasty wave and donates $300 while hanging ten. 
This would be fucking cool if it caught some traction.
Lol, I could do a GTAV stunt and donate before my car crashes and bursts into flames
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:33:31
Great point! If you compare it that way, then assuming the 10% dip in price was directly caused by [*edit*] stolen bitcoin being dumped [*/edit*], then this theft was more significant to bitcoin than Bernie's impact on the $. However, the $ system is much more complex than the BTC system, in that there is a giant web of credit and wagers and debt involved. If, however, Bernie had stolen that $65 billion in the span of 48 hours and sold those dollars for yen (or whatever) and the $ markets were as relatively simple as BTC is today, it would have been significanly more significant (hah), though it probably wouldn't have caused the $ to dip 10% (but again, the complexity and magnitude of the $ system is far beyond BTC).
So in terms of the BTC vs $ system, yes Evo is more impactfull. In terms of value stolen Bernie is more impactfull.

Fair enough. I don't think there will be significant long term damage though.
I wasn't attempting to explain the price dip, I was just using it as a metric to measure the damage done by this occurance. Assuming the worst, there has been an immediate $400mil worth of damage, and if the price recovers back to $290 in a few days it will be very difficult to determine the amount of long term damage, if any.
I'm trying to defend these guys, I just think we all need to realize there are bigger and badder things out there that happen every day, and yet those systems are still chugging along. Think of how broken the $ is and it's still going. Bictoin has so much more potential, and currently it is still doing fine.

Not talking about banks, we're talking about Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme vs. Evo.
When I originally posted this I was comparing the value of Bernie Madoff's scandal to Evo's scandal: $65bil vs. $0.014bil. If you assume the theft is the direct cause to the recent price dip, then the new numbers are $65bil vs. $0.394bil ($290x~14,000,000btc-$262x14,000,000btc+$14,000,000). The Evo number could potentially be offset by the amount of created value caused by the liquidation of free market commerce. Bernie, regardless of what he invested his stolen dollars in, is supporting the debt based and totally monopolized $ system. 
Sure the pond was lowered more than the ocean, but that wasn't my point, and not to mention but the pond seems to be recovering fairly quickly.

I don't understand how you can interperet the title of my post as ragging on Bitcoin. The title is meant to point out that what is one of the largest thefts of bitcoin to date, it is nothing compared to the amount of fiat that is being stolen on a regular basis. It says nothing about Bitcoin the technology.
This occurance, in my mind, has opened the eyes of dark market users a little wider. As more of their money is stolen, they will default to higher security standards such as 2FA and multi-sig, and will no longer accept having their funds held by a third party. Eventually, by the time Bitcoin reaches mass adoption, users will have so many legitimate security apps and options that mass bitcoin theivery will be much more difficult to accomplish.
