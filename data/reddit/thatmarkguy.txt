Its a percentage game. Last 4 weeks, +112.69%. I don’t even think thats a record weekly gain.

Its not a certainty, but spiking to $19.5k past 24 hours says this ship is only getting faster. If not end of the month I’d say end of Q1 2018 at the latest

Because this is becoming more and more a market swayed by institutional investors. People who can plough millions of client funds in for a day or two

50k by the end of 2018? 2017 maybe.

Don’t do it. Unless you can afford to pay however much the repayments are without being concerned you’re paying that much out. To me the risk of volatility is too great.
Investing should only come from your surplus

Customer: Hi there, I’d like a latte please.
Barista: *Certainly sir, that’ll be 0.002632 BTC.*
Customer: Here you go *beeps bitcoin device*
Barista: Okay thanks. Your coffee will be ready in an hours time once we hit 6 confirmations.
I don’t get it.

Just to give a real world example of this - at the moment Post Office Money will sell you $1.3107 per £1 when the actual interbank rate is $1.3404 - 2.215% difference. Crypto isn’t fiat though so I do think people would swallow a rate 3-5% above or below market

It would probably work like a travel money shop; manipulating exchange rates and commission.
Lets say at the moment the “market rate” on GDAX is 1 BTC = £5729.
Shop advertises it will sell bitcoin at the hamstrung rate of £6250
Shop also advertises it will buy bitcoin for £5250
So customer A comes along
“I’d like to buy 1BTC please ��”
Customer A pays £6250
Shop buys at market rate paying £5729
Customer leaves with a bitcoin on a hardware wallet
Shop just made £521
Customer B comes along
“I’d like to sell you 1BTC please ��”
Customer B is paid the shops buy price of £5250
Shop sells the bitcoin on for market rate of £5729
Shop just made £479
Why would people go for these worse rates? Crypto is cool and you’re selling convenience. I’ll put my savings into crypto at the CryptoShop and I can then sell it back to them in a few months.
I mention commissions - you could charge 2% per trade - so customer A pays £105.58 extra which is straight profit.
