truly a sad day. i was inspired to create dicenow after seeing the power of crowd sourced casino bankrolling. doog and deb need to pack it up, leave canada, and setup shop somewhere else. 6000 btc is enough to hit up some tropical island

Hey everyone. I spent 3 months making this dice game. Check it out and please give me feedback so I can improve it!
The cool features are an onsite robot that plays automatically for you according to a betting progression like martingale.
There is also a neat auto mode, that does over 9000 rolls (10,000 max) per click.
If you want to be the house, you can invest in the bankroll. Essentially this is passive gambling, but you get positive expected value due to the house edge %.
You get 1000 freecoins to play for free, so please give it a try!
I'll be around to answer any questions.

yeah chrome has some kind of redraw refresh bug that happens from time to time. not sure why, probably has to do with the css animations. i'll keep trying to debug it.

thanks aahz. what browser are you using? can you give me a screenshot please?

i just tested withdrawal with 0.01 btc and it works fine

i understand your view aahz.
there are features that bring something new to the table, like the multiple house edges, investor selectable kelly, realtime profit graph, auto 10k mode, onsite bot, and design. so i don't think it is just a pointless me too clone.
it isn't going to be just a dice game either. i'm planning on adding much more. but you have to start somewhere right?
also building a 'simple' dice site has taught me a lot about bitcoin protocol, and will help me in the future to build other bitcoin webapp services. this is just the beginning for me and i'm very excited about contributing to the cryptocurrency community :)
