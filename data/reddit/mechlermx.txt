The last days I am watching every five minutes at Cryptonaut on my mobile. Bitcoin green and my alt coin portfolio totally crashed.

$ 1,000 or $ 100,000 everything seems to be possible at the moment.

Doesn't sound like a friend, but be careful it seems he is in control of the private keys and in the worst case he could pretend to have just lost them.

Good news, but I would like to know what does this mean in reality:
 “The decree provides for the introduction into civil circulation of Cryptocurrencies and tokens based on the technology of blockchain. A comprehensive legal regulation is proposed so that HTP residents can provide crypto exchange services, exchange Cryptocurrencies, attract financing through ICOs, [and] use Cryptocurrencies and tokens in civil circulation.”
Will bitcoin be officially accepted as legal tender, how about bitcoin atms, ICOs etc.?
Would be great if somebody could write more about it, but I doubt that anybody knows what their plan is.

Bitcoin is digital gold. The golden nail reminds me of a physical brain wallet lol, I didn't know that silver is more scarce than gold.
