I concur. The wild west as most call it. The catch 22 is we don't want outside regulation until something out of our control happens.
The crypto community is going to have to embrace regulation in order to keep users funds safe. 
It be cool if Coinbase came out with a debit card of some sort.

And......  back to $15.900
Bless you!

Why? We don't wsnt to be a Bcash wannabe... Bitcoin isn't being used for what it was originally intended, at least not for the most part. 
Be patient. Segwit and LN will be here soon enough and we'll look back at the whole big block discussions and laugh.
Perhaps when Bitcoin needs to handle millions of transactions per hour, then Segwit, LN &amp; a slightly bigger block can make the system smooth and once we see some balance on volatility, we can use it for it's intensive purposes.

No worries....   it won't last. There's no development over at Bcash. It won't die mind you, but it will find the same problems as Bitcoin does now come this time next year.
They'll be begging for Segwit and LN.
On another note. I give them shills over at r/BitcoinCash hell, and they still won't ban me.

I'm not talking about it because I do not trust these things. Sure, the idea is cool, but there's no way I'm letting my crypto sit somewhere I don't trust. We're not scaled for currency yet. To much volatility.
Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:28:59
That.. you can count on. ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:48:29
Bye bye Bcash.... lol.

Shows what you know. I actually spent BTC just yesterday from a company that accepts it. Company name: FastTech
When it came to 2x, everyone needed to be on board or none at all. BTC will get its scalability in due time.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:36:53
Just under $2 Good thing FastTech has free shipping, aye?

Being a "normal bitcoin user" is the first mental mistake. If you use bitcoin for whatever reason, you need to be up on all the information like flies on shit!
If you lose BTC due to no Reply Protection, I'm sorry to say, but it's your own damn fault. Be ready, be prepared! NO2X!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:48:56
Is that why it's tanking right now?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:20:44
I'm betting it goes back down to the mid $300's, if not lower.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:01:26
Looks like it still is.

I concur. I'm a self admittiing newb to the crypto world and can only afford a small holding in Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin, but I have logic and patience on my side. I've followed and researched economice and the eminant failure of fiat currencies. I am not swayed by this dip and I know in my heart that Bitcoin isn't going away. It is the future. When Jamiee Dimon comes out and starts talking shit about Bitcoin, you know he's scared, because his bankster empire is threatened.

Good question and curious as well. I've recently moved everything off of Coinbase into my Ledger Nano S. I've been curious if I leave it there, will or will I not get the forked coins?
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:11:35
Fantastic. Thanks for the answer. I didn't see that or haven't found that statement yet. I did create a support ticket and asked them regarding this subject but don't expect an answer in a week or so.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:43:44
Lets not forget over $300 trillion in outstanding global derivatives....

I never said I was an expert. I have however, in the last 4 days and been trying my best to find the information needed to best come out on top of this anticipated fork. I've learned a lot on the last several months.
What I'm looking for clarification on, is how to best benefit from the split.
I missed out on the BTC/BCH split by a matter of days due to the fact I was having my DL renewed and couldn't get verified on Coinbase.
Now that I have my feet wet and half ass know whats going on, I would like, if possible, to benefit from the split as most people did with the BTC/BCH split.

I got a Ledger Nano S. Of course, they're backordered from Europe, but you can pay a hefty premium from Amazon......  like my inpatient ass did.
