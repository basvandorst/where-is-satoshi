Do you have replace-by-fees activated? You could increase your fees if you need it so urgently then. 
Alternativly there are accelerators that work, but they are expensive. But I don't know which are the real ones myself.
Last option is to just wait, if its not urgent.


Fees where never at this level in the last week. Maybe you mean fees to get into a block in 24 hours were ~100 sat/byte.

To be fair, this isn't a strong argument for anything. It's the same as BCash-believers quoting something by Nakamoto and saying they are following Nakamoto's vision.
Both had only limited knowledge because of the time they were active, and are also not prophets but engineers that will change their opinion if they learn about new ways to improve their project.

So many bullshit comments here.
The answer is: Yes you can. First you need a exchange, where you can buy and withdraw with very low fees. I use bitstamp here in europe, i heard Gemini is also good for this (but haven't tested it myself).
Let's go with Bitstamp: Theoretically you can deposit money for free over SEPA (bank transfer). Then you can buy Bitcoin with a 0.25% fee (so instead of 5$ worth of btc you would have 4.98). After this you can withdraw the Bitcoin to a address of your choice. If you wan't to exchange your bitcoin for another crypto on a exchange like Binance, you need to get your bitcoin-deposit address on this exchange and withdraw (it's free because bitstamp pays all fees for you) your 4.98$ of bitcoin to this address.
But some points to think about:
- You need to register yourself on Bitstamp/Gemini etc. and on a exchange. This registration are annoying: They often need copies of your passport etc. and it can take hours / days (depending on the current workload for the companies) to get verified.
- You need to watch all the minimum limits. For example you need to buy at least 5$ on Bitstamp (so you probably should use a few cents more then 5$). The other exchanges can have similar borders.
- Buying a small amount of a sub-penny coin doesn't make any sense if you haven't put in enough research. Often you will loose your money, because you invested in a so called "shitcoin". So why not stay with Bitcoin and understanding the technology before expanding your portfolio of cryptocurrencies.

Segwit transactions are way cheaper, because you have to pay for less Bytes to be transfered.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:26:48


Well Bitstamp has implemented Segwit and sends transactions batched, so they don't pay so much. They seem to be one of the more competent exchanges out there.  


You mean to send them to other exchanges or websites? Because withdrawing BCH doesn't substitute withdrawing bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:42:27
Well you could argue, that everyone who needs to know (like the different dev-groups), that transactions are taking to long does know, while not everyone in the community that should know about the advantages knows of SegWit. Also we atleast know, that groups like the core devs etc. are currently working on it, but other companies like coinbase just seem to ignore it.
But yeah, you have some points. I would say a sticky post for how and why to use segwit should be enough.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:23:14


I would! (Did you maybe mean 2MB, because 20MB is extreme).
[Here]( for example a summary of a paper, that argues, that an increase to 2MB would kill 40% of all full-nodes immediatly and 50% in 6 months.

@_date: 2018-01-02 23:47:14


? Aren't you contradicting yourself here? If "the demand is endless" then on-chain scaling wouldn't clearly not work, because you would need to increase the blocksize "endlessly".
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:45:25
What? Do you mean in addition to the block reward? Miners get blockreward + miner fee.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:44:50
I'm a bit late with my answer, so you are probably the only one to read this :D


I would argue that even BTC is very young. And if the BCH devs would not split the community and instead try to work together, we would probably have an even better decentralization in the development. I think that multiple full-node dev-team is just useless. In the end they have to make a consensus or one of them will create a hardfork. So why not work together in one repository?


I'm not sure if there is any Crypto project with a more decentralised development. In the end organisations like Blockstream and Blockchainlabs are needed, because even the bitcoin developers need food and money in the end of the day. Maybe scholarships by the community would be a solution. Also more companies that make a profit of Bitcoin should atleast pay some developers. I have the hope that this will improve with the success of bitcoin.


No, core hasn't done a blocksize increases, because they would destroy the decentralized distribution of full nodes. 
It was estimated, that a increase to 2MB would cause a drop of 40% of all full nodes immediately and 60% after 6 months [1]. And losing decentralization would be disastrous, because it is the main distinct selling point of bitcoin. 


That's wrong. Most of the core devs doesn't work directly on 2nd layer solutions. This is done by other groups like the lightning lab (for me it seems, that ligntning is developed how bch full nodes are advertised to be developed: decentralised by different groups).
And yes, the core devs worked extensively on 1st layer scaling solutions, like Segwit, Rootstock, Mast and Schnorr. They are not mainly scaling solutions, but scaling + improving the tech seems better for me. I strongly believe, that we should first focus on using the blockspace efficiently. BCH has transactions 6 times the size of BTC at the moment (to be fair, this is probably so extreme, because no one really uses the bch-blockchain). 
Segwit should give us the equivalent to 2 - 3MB blocks. 2MB is enough to even withstand the worst time situation we had till now. So I have high hope for the next months. If we have 90% Segwit distribution and we see, that it's not enough, then we can increase the blocksize (this corresponds to the [core - scaling roadmap](


Long term the fate of the Bitcoin project depends on layer 2 solutions, because scaling on-chain for real world usage is simply impossible, without destroying decentralization completely. And if you want 100 GB blocks, all nodes will run in big server farms and decentralization is completely destroyed. In this situation you can simply use a big spreadsheet.
Last but not least: I don't believe, that BCH would be even the right bet, if BTC is failing. There are many other projects which have better tech and have a healthier community / development. BCH even lost it common history with BTC as an advantage and is, from now on, just one of many Altcoins.

Debatable. If you don't want trivial transactions on the main-chain, than it could be a good thing (but I guess no one used this payment method).
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:46:07


But he should always use GDAX to withdraw if possible (i can't because GDAX isn't accessible from my country so I use bitstamp). This will save him a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:05:48
Wrong. Because he would be new he could instantly use Segwit wallets. Also the current fee market isn't to bad if you can wait a few hours. 
Two days ago I did send a non-segwit transaction for 50 sat/B paying ~2.5$ and got verified in the next block. So if he would use segwit and a fee of 100 sat / byte he should be good at the moment.
But to be fair, this doesn't make sense for 5$. I just wanted to show, that 20-25$ is just wrong. But he still could try the way I outlined in another comment. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:07:15


No. With a "cheap miner" you will never be able to mine a block yourself. To be able to mine a block solo you probably need to think in millions of dollars of equipment. You can mine in a pool, but you have no control over the blocks that you mine there.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:01:31
Ohh, I believe there was a misunderstanding. So you just meant, that we still need on-chain scaling one day even if LN etc. will be widely used. Yes I think almost no one disagrees, that on-chain scaling will be needed someday.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:07:17
Yes, but for me it shows it in BTC, so the question is, if you can change the units.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:08:02
There are enough exchanges that let you withdraw for free namely Bitstamp, Gemini and GDAX (probably more which I don't know).
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:42:46
With decreasing block reward the fee will become a bigger portion of the entire reward per block. 


This phrasing confuses me a bit, sorry. Do you mean that the fee per transaction will rise? Or that the incentive to put transactions into the blog will rise? 
Suppose you meant that the fee will rise: The fee per transaction will not rise necessarily if the block reward drops. The fee market is independent of this. If there are more transactions as will fit in the block, there will be competition between the transactions. If there are way less, the miners will probably include all transactions into the block to just collect the fees. If the fees + blockreward isn't enough for some miners to survive they will simply need to give up or go bancrupt. 
All in all it is very probably that: A. The blocksize is bigger at this timepoint and more transactions are in one block (so the total fees are bigger) and B. Bitcoin is much more worth, so that even a few satoshis in fees could be much.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:18:56


Such a quote would probably make Satoshi sad. Because if you just trust his words that he made with limited knowledge (because of the time), you are more or less are following a religion and not understanding what decentralisation means.


Which one?
- The devs and the "CEO" of BCH? Where one dev has done almost all work for the full node implementation? The devs and companies that started this whole shitty drama? 
- Or the devs of ETH? The one that just give a fuck about the immutability of their chain if it's profits their board members? And the creators who premined a giant portion of all coins?
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:56:47


Yes, you are right, I could see this as an "attack vector" which will be used against bitcoin.
My personal opinion is, that miners will just mine as long as the electricity price is good enough to make a profit. If the electricity price will become to high they need to use more efficient solutions, or big miners will probably slowly die off.
All in all I believe more in the concept of "making external costs internal" if it's about environmentalism.

Why? Or just because humanity could die in general?

A blocksize increase will probably be needed one day. But at first we should wait till we know the effect of the block size increase of a &gt;90% SegWit adoption. The discussion was never about "if" but a "how" and "when".

Implementing isn't the correct word here. I would say "usage". Segwit itself is implemented.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:00:33
How will that work? If you want to control which transactions goes into the blocks, you need to mine the block. And you simply can't compete with the big pools (except if you want to invest big time, like milllions of $), so you will never be able to mine a block.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:28:47






No, how should anyone get this estimate? Any number you will hear are just wild guesses.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:14:39


Increasing the blocksize belongs to the [scaling roadmap]( of the core devs. But I would advocate to improve the efficiency of block usage first, and then (if needed) increase the blocksize. As long as Segwit (which should give us the equivalent to 2-3MB blocksize) isn't at 90% we don't need a risky blocksize increase. And improvements like Schnorr are coming, too. 
At the moment I have high hopes that even Segwit (maybe with the additional scaling increase by LN, Schnorr etc.) will be enough. Also we shouldn't forget that Segwit is basically a blocksize increase itself. I don't see any benefit (except for some companies like Bitmain) in blocking Segwit like the BCash advocates want to. It's a blocksize increase without the need of a risky (and probably harmful) hardfork.


It seems i quoted the wrong value. It should say 50%.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:22:09


Thats impossible to say. The fee depends on many factor like the number of transactions, blocksize, price of a bitcoin, how wallets and exchanges set their fee, batching rate etc. 
For example: If the current average fee is about 30$, and Bitcoin drops to 1/30 of it current price, you would suddenly have a fee of 1$. 
We can only say that full SegWit will give us block of the size of ~2-3MB. This seems to be enough for the current mempool.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:54:13
Well Bitcoin is at the moment the most secure (and decentralised) blockchain.  They have the most experienced and talented devs of (almost) all crypto-currency projects out there. Their development is the most active of all crypto-currencies. There are many additional teams, that works on extra features like LN, sidechains and other products.  And if there is really a killer-feature that another blockchain coin has the core devs can simply copy it if needed (or implement it as a sidechain).
Just a few arguments against the "they were only the first"-argument I here often (not directly as a response to what you said here).  
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:43:36


To be fair the first goal of lightning doesn't seem to be anonymity. I believe for most people the anonymity of lightning is enough. 
And the same argument of this post could be made if bitcoin adds something like Mimblewimble. Could be interesting. 
But I myself hope for the implementation and wide usage of atomic swap (using the lightning network) between Bitcoin and one or two of the privacy coins.


Is it? Is there any limit how many transactions i could theoretically do over a channel? How do we know if in 5 years everyone starts one channel a month or year for all possible transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:41:34


Well that seems to depend to what you define as inconsequential. Are you talking about inconsequential on a supercomputer or a gameboy :D And how does that correspond to the average node hardware. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:18:37


Your argumentation is wrong here. This is a faulty generalization. You are running a full node at current block size, so you can't argue with this over the situation with a bigger blocksize. [Here]( a summary of a paper that argues, that a blocksize increase to 2MB could lead to a drop off 40% of all full nodes immediatly and 60% in 6 months.


Yes, but this is not the main argument why a high number of nodes is important. A high number of nodes is needed to keep the network decentralised. And decentralisation is the main distinct selling point of Bitcoin.
Also it should atleast be possible for everyone at every time, to use a full node to verify the correct behaviour of the network and your own transactions. This is maybe still possible with 4MB, but if we want to scale to real world scenarios we need &gt;1GB.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:39:39


Bitcoin was created to replace banking by a decentralised system. This is what for example LN tries to solve. And this is where I haven't seen any other Blockchain-Coin proposing a solution for.


? Well the whole goal of almost all cryptos that want to replace banking / the monetary system is to replace the centralised cash / credit card system by a decentralised peer-to-peer system. This is for example why increasing the blocksize is a stupid idea. Because increasing the blocksize to be big enough to do this for billions of people with several transactions a day, would kill decentralisation. Block of &gt;100 GB would probably necessary and only a handfull of companies would be able to verify the chain with their fullnodes. And then we could also simply replace it by a big database like paypal or credit cards.


Which ones? I could maybe see that you are talking about some Tangle-Coins like IOTA that often have other goals and are currently not really working / very early in development. But the answer how they want to compete? With LN and probably many future solution that could include sidechains and higher layers. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:04:16


I think we completly differ in our vision what all of this will become here. My vision is more coherent with the one of Andreas in the video I linked (ok, didn't do that, sorry, will edit the original post, [here]( is the video I speak about). I don't think we will buy things like we nowadays do. I believe we will make many micropayments, for example for blog posts etc. I also believe in a possible "stream" of money to pay for example for your electricity (so maybe 1tx every minute you use it). I really want to use the possibilites of this technology to it's fullest! 


This for example shows extremly strong our difference in vision here. I don't see bitcoin as one "startup" on the internet. For me Bitcoin will become "the internet of money". Something big. 


I said 3 per week.


Right! And we also need to be careful by choosing what we need now and not destroying Bitcoin by careless blocksize increases or things like that. 


Have you read my post? Or maybe I was unclear there, I wrote:


So to be clear here: I meant that we not magically need a bigger blocksize because of LN. A widely used LN could maybe let us do enough transactions for a 10MB block but still with only needing 1MB of real blockspace. Maybe even more. But yes further scaling maybe need a blocksize increase (and no one is disputing that). 
Back to my calculations:
- We really are just talking about customer buying thing in the moment. B2B could rise the number to new highs!
- According to [this]( paper there were 23.6 transactions per active consumer cards (in 2016). So my 3/7 tx per day (3 per week) is way to low. 2/3 would probably be a better guess.
- There are different organisations like Google and Facebook, that want to bring the internet to everyone by 2020. The portion of people with internet connection is vastly growing. So 3 billion of 7 billion would suddenly be only 42%. According to [this]( statistic  ~42% of all credit cards are Visa-Cards, so 42% doesn't seem to be to crazy. 


- Do you have a source to this claim? I couldn't find anything about this. Sure a few people will probably be moneyless. But at the moment I don't think that this is more than 1% of the worldpopulation. But i would be happy if you prove me incorrect here. Also don't you believe they would use money if they had easier access to a form of banking whichbitcoin and his layers could bring later?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:37:07


Yes, but in the first place it's a protocol. You know how many layers the internet-protocol has? 7.
Bitcoin can replace fiat currency by using the lightning network. Doing coffee-size  transactions on the mainchain would destroy decentralization completely because of the needed size of the blockchain. And decentralization is the main-distinct selling point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:58:15
But the block reward works like intended. And the miner fee works also like intended by the principles of the free market (competing for blockspace by fees).  
And 300k is a bit much, its more like 12.5 * 17k$ = ~212k$

Bullshit. 
[Here]( is the scaling roadmap, signed by almost all core developers, where they agree to a possible blocksize increase when the other scaling solutions are exhausted. Many core devs have even proposed blocksize increases themselves (see for example BIP 103). There was just no consensus for this.
Finally you shouldn't forget that Segwit IS a blocksize increase but without the need of a risky hardfork that would probably end in a new split.

- Update every tutorial for beginners that you have control over to explicitly discourage new users from using coinbase.
- ... or atleast using GDAX, so that Coinbase is paying the enormous and uneeded fees they are using. 
- add new tutorials for beginners including information about why segwit will save them money and spread them. Encourage usage of exchanges that use Segwit in them.
- Use twitter and other social networks to tell as many beginner / coinbase user  as possible, that their plattform is way more expensive than other alternatives (and maybe also, that it is directly attacking BTC) that use segwit. Reddit isn't enough (compare our 630k users with Coinbase's 10 million users).
- giving the coinbase app bad reviews because of the way to high fees compared to many other exchanges
- and so on...

Don't use Ebay, that seems like a easy way to get scammed.
(Also if I have a look in your comments, you seem to be interested in the &lt;5$ coins. Be careful with this, there are many traps and at the moment I believe we will get a crash where 80 - 90% of all this cheap altcoins will die. Don't use money which you can't afford to loose completly.)

I don't know in which time. But it would be completly illogical to use non-segwit if you could use SegWit-transactions. So the transactions should move to a high adoption over time.

OK, let's make a relative rough calcutlation here. Suppose we want to reach almost all people that currently have internet. This are ~3 billion people. And let's say every of this person needs to buy food twice a week, and does atleast one other random buy a week. So we are at 3 transactions a week or 3/7 transactions per day. So:
3 billion * 3/7 = 1285714285,71 tx's/day = 14880 tx's per second. 
With 1MB we get ~7tx's/s, so we need a block of 2125 mb. I personally have a bigger vision if it's about the number of transactions. I want to bring banking to everyone maybe even to robots. To extend what I mean have a look at the video I link in the next paragraph.


Currently. Also I do probably &gt; 1 transaction per day. And one of the cool things we can and hopefully will do (and btcacc talked about "creating the future") are daily micropayments and maybe stream of money. [Here]( a very interesting video of a talk by Andreas about scaling. It includes interesting visions for the future and extends my arguments.


Not directly. At the moment you can't know that. Suppose suddenly everyone would start to do all their transactions on lightning networks and per opened channel we would take 10 transactions off the chain. Suddenly we could even life with lower blocksizes. This will clearly not happen, but I just wanted to illustrate, that there isn't a automatic implication of LN -&gt; bigger blocksize.


Yeah, thats why we have the blocksize increase in form of SegWit. Further blocksize increases would be very dangerous for decentralisation. Estimations by [this]( ([summary]( of the for this discussion important points) paper are that a 2MB blocksize increase would result in a drop of 40% of all nodes immediatly and 50% after several months. So we need to be careful with blocksize increases, and especially need more research in how much nodes can currently handle.
A blocksize needs clearly to happen in the future, but I think that it is better to be conservative about this to not destroy decentralisation, because decentralisation is the main distinct feature of Bitcoin. If you just want cheap and fast payments / but centralised, you can use CC or Paypal or the first state/bank controlled blockchains that will arrive to fight Bitcoin.
Edit: I forget to address the following statement:


Yes, but the goal of this complete project is to replace the banking system by a decentralised one that is peer to peer. So atleast let's aim and develop for 100%. Also even with 10% adoption we will get problems. And if it's mainly used for Streams of money etc. every user could maybe make 50 tx per day (for example in the background of apps, or maybe you want to pay your electricity every hour).
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:16:30
What? No, you save money at each transaction by your segwit address. And even now with only 10% usage it saves some blockspace, so the situation would be worse if this percentage drops. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:57:15
Thats wrong, he could use a exchange to buy bitcoin, that has better fees. So what went wrong is not informing himself/herself which exchanges have the best fees (especially withdrawing fees).
He could have tried Bitstamp, GDAX or Gemini which all have 0 withdrawing fees for user.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:11:12
What a transaction are you doing that you need 1kb of data? How many in- and outputs and are you sending from a Segwit address?
Edit: Wait it even needs to be 10kb of data? 10kb * 1mbtc = 10mbtc = 170$
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:03:09








You'r right, but it is better, than just guessing from your own experiences. What we need is way more research in this area, before making a decision that could hurt the network. 


You can't argue, what people have in gaming machines. Full nodes often run on old/cheaper devices. In the paper they quote a survey in which half of all nodes have less then the needed 8GB ram.


Such a "floating" blocksize seems very dangerous to me. For example I could see spam attacks  by miners with tx's (with a fee &lt;1sat/byte) to attack weaker miner and nodes and push them off the network.
Also a scaling to 8MB would never get enough consensus. It would just lead to a new hardfork. And we already had one, so I don't see a point at the moment.
I believe consensus would be way easier if we would max out what we could do with the current tech: Full Segwit usage (and so a 2 - 3MB Block), all big exchanges use batched tx's and maybe new stuff like Schnorr or LN (depending how they will work out and how fast they are coming). 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:54:06
Adding to this, lightning will probably amplify the segwit usage. And segwit will give us the equivalent to 2-3MB blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:28:47
I use Bitstamp. I heard their registration is also slow, but I would atleast start the verification now, than you can use your account atleast in a week from now.

The scammer could have manipulated the ledger in some really sophisticated ways (some cool hardware-based-hacks or so). But this is veeeery unlikely.

@_date: 2018-01-07 18:26:38
15 inputs o.O That's much. And I still can't see how you reach 10kb (which is needed to get to $200 with 1mBtc/kb). [This]( transaction seems to be bigger than yours and is only 4.5kb large. Are you sure you don't mean a size of 1kb? Then your fees should be at 17$ if you use 1mbt/kb.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:01:06
To be clear, this is still on the testnet and not on mainnet. Is there a mainnet explorer?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:16:40
Yes, my max. was 3$ with a non-segwit address a few days ago. With my segwit addresses i normally use i never paid more then 2$. To be fair, I don't use platforms that have giant fees like Coinbase. I use Bitstamp if I want to buy crypto, and they are free if it comes to withdrawing (thank god to segwit and batching).
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:38:44
But Localbitcoin can be not available or to unsafe to use in some bigger cities. 
Also i don't see a problem with buying from exchanges, because they are legal corporations, with whom i have a contract that they need to fullfill.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:16:44


Yes. I think we will see how Lightning will work out.


So till now LN is a proposal for this, for which i hope, that it will work, because it would make payments fast enough for easier real-life usage. I think the only solution to scale Bitcoin (or BCash) in a order of magnitude that is needed for mainstreaming is by using off-chain solutions. I would argue on-chain scaling isn't even impossible, because the blocks needed to be gigantic (see Andreas' argumentation [here]( It will at least destroy decentralisation completly, but decentralisation is the main selling point of Bitcoin. 
If you remove decentralisation to get fast and cheap transactions (probably short-term), there aren't many distinct selling point to the coin anymore. Every government and bank could simply copy the blockchain technology and make it centralised or just propose a centralised system like paypal without relevant fees (i can see them doing that to destroy Bitcoin). A government banning mining could be a way bigger problem than it would be now. Furthermore decentralisation is even a main selling point against many other cryptos. 


Are you equalling the Core Developers and Blockstream here? If so this is not true, see [here]( and [this]( argumentation. (Coincidential to this [smeggletoot's comment to a comment to his comment i linked]( is very fitting to your comment to lightning :) )
Edit: Everything you did send where disadvantages of Bitcoin or Blockchain-currencies in general. I hoped you had some (new) pro's for BCash for me :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:04
If your case is, that even with LN there will still be high fees (why?), then there will be no solution for the distant future to keep bitcoin away from such a scenario.
More probable is, that LN and a further distribution of segwit, the number of transactions on the chain will first drop, and with it the fees. Then if the block is full in the distant future (don't forget that the LN scaling is way higher than most other solutions, and if tx-fees are rising LN usage would grow further) the core-developers can carefully increase the blocksize corresponding with the technological growth while keeping the coin decentralised.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:28:42
Mr. Ver, it is retarded to think, that every newbie knows from the beginning what you mean by Cash and Core. Why not use more distinguishable names like Bitcoin (for core) and BCash (for cash). This would be way clearer and more friendly to new users. I even believe this will help BCash project and the whole crypto economics (because this whole discussion will stop and everyone will put their time in making their Coin as good as possible).
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:02:57
We have one. Called segwit. It would be nice if the big players like coinbase start using it.
Edit: Also why BCash? I would argue that there are many better coins out there. For example: LTC for example has everything BCash has + Segwit + LN (in the future). At the moment i didn't see what even the value of BCash is. The common history? Well all the new money comming in doesn't share that, so for them it doesn't matter (and even without them, the history of the chains have splitted strongly because many people sold their bcash) 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:17:30
I don't belive he is talking about a situation where Coinbase themselves steal your coin, but a renegade employee (or a general hack from the outside). And if they steal as much as they did with Mt. Gox, you are simply fucked. Try to sue a company that has nothing left.
On the other side i hope, that the security of the exchanges is way better now. Also i heard that there are now insurances in the game, but i didn't look into this, so this could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:44:54
Seems fake to me. Maybe I am missing some information, but how do you accidently send BTC to some claimed address? If you made a type error the probability that you hit a address that is already in use is at ~0% (there is atleast a space of 2^160 adresses and maybe 1 million used adresses)
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:56:20
Bullshit. "Core's interests", what should that even mean?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:06:48
If someone would buy 100k in BCash instead of Bitcoin because of his promotion (and loosing money because of this), wouldn't he/she be able to sue Ver over this? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:56:10
Which is really problematic. I believe the fee market would even relax, if the service providers add options for "can wait 2 hours", "can wait 4 hours" ... "can wait 12 hours" to set the fee (and lets advanced users simple set the sat/byte). This would strengthen the free market for fees, because not every transaction from this plattforms will overpay (for the use-cases)
Also everyone could try to avoid them, if they don't want to pay too much (,i know this is not feasible for everyone).
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:06


I like this. It is one of the most sensible ideas I have seen here in the comments. I would maybe somehow add the number of distinct nodes into the calculation (but not sure how, because one company could simply run 30.000 nodes by themselve), to have a even more dynamic check if the network stays decentralised. Also I would argue about that max. size of 16MB. I'm not sure if in 10 years the traffic everywhere can handle that. Maybe 8 MB would suffice, and if we see in 10 years, that this constant could be increased it could be done way easier (hopefully as a Soft Fork!). Also there is the open question if we want a min-size. What if LN is so succesfull that 1MB blocks are suddenly only half-full?
Also, I could see an more Dynamic Formula handle the increase. Something Like:
AmountToInCreaseBy = 50kb*(((NumFullBlocks/FullBlocks)-0.5)*2) 
This would mean: 0% --&gt; 50kb decrease; 25% --&gt; 25kb decrease; 50% --&gt; no change; 75% --&gt; 25kb increase; 100% --&gt; 50kb increase.
(I want to increase if &gt;50% of the blocks were full, else i would decrease. If this border is the right, is debatable)
The question is if there are attack vectors: Maybe the miners could artificially fill their block with 0 Sat / byte transactions, to increase the blocksize as fast as possible, because they believe that centralisation is good for them. For this we may add a rule of the form FullBlock = Block which is filled with Transactions that have a fee &gt;1 sat/byte (this border should maybe dynamicly drop from a higher border, because 1 sat/byte is still cheap enough for miners to keep it up for a long time).
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:24:55
Yeah, couldn't the BCash community get rid of him. I believe it would be good for their Project.

I'm looking for a statistic about this the last X days. Could you link any?
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:06:39
But why not putting your money from BCash in a better Altcoin? There seem to be almost no advantages of BCash compared to Alts like ETH or LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:46:04
I'm suprised with all the problems people here have with the big players like Bittrex.
Two days ago i tried to get some Crypto from Bittrex. I couldn't because i wasn't verified. So i started to verify my account, and after a few hours (they said 10 minutes, but i can live with that), my account got an enhanced verification. Moving my coins (in this case ETH) was also processed rapidly. Also i had no problems with moving coins to and away from Poloniex. Maybe it's because i didn't move thousands of dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:08:58
Why is bitcoin not a technology? It is the first and most developed decentralised crypto currency. The decentralisation is the key in this case. The blockchain technology is just a (brilliant) tool to get this goal.
And why is Ethereum more of an technology than bitcoin in this example? You mena because technology like the smart contracts? Yes, they are also brilliant, but there is nothing that stops the core developers to implement a similiar mechanism in the bitcoin protocol, if there is a demand. Maybe you are forgetting, that behind bitcoin is a gigantic research and development team.
But yes, i can see Bitcoin fail, but if it fails than because crypto currencies (also Ethereum etc.) are failing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:01:40
Try It on testnet, Demo's on mainnet are already running. Such a complex software need's to be tested extensivly. A bigger hack of Bitcoin would probably throw the whole crypto distribution back for years.
You did understand, that this comment was made in the context of "miner and exchanges try to block Segwit in Lightning IN THE FUTURE". Try to read the context next time.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:28:32


See my comment here: 


Why are you coming up with this old stuff? Gavin last [commit]( was on April 19. Before that he stopped committing in September 2015. He was not really active for 18 months. So why is it interesting, that they revoke his "maintainer permissions", if he wasn't contributing anymore. It's bad security to give someone commit access if he doesn't contribute to the project anymore.
They revoked his commit access because they believed that he maybe had been hacked. And they didn't give it back, because it wasn't needed and a security risk (have a look for example at ISO 27001).
And if Garvin wants to contribute he still can like everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:51:41


Wrong. A. We aren't just talking about miners. I believe Full Nodes to validate the network are as important for decentralisation! And many of them will die if we just increase the Block size. Especially for a bigger size that will be necessary in a year. B. A Blocksize increase that would be needed to scale for all the things you list, and for mainstream usage, would need to be way bigger than 1GB. With this, we really would just have centralised mining in big Data-Centers left, which is easy to control by governments and attacked by banks (they could copy the system in this case, because what is the worth of a centralised crypto that hasn't any advantages over some of the current free payment networks in place) C. And to be fair, where does this 20$ always come here? I didn't pay more than 3$ even at the worst times. But I see, that some shitty platforms will not let you choose your fee freely.


Because scaling for the purposes you listed is a scaling of many orders-of-magnitude if you want it to be mainstream! This can't be solved by blocksize increases, because the blocks would rapidly need to be at several GB per 10 Minutes. This will only be feasible in big data-centers, with which BTC loose it's main distinct feature: Decentralisation! If you want to say "fuck you" to the government, you can't create a centralised shitcoin, which will at this point be easily attackable by governments and banks. 
I can see (and would agree if we are sure, that it will not kill &gt;5% of the nodes), that 2x/4x will help us shortterm. But i believe we are in a phase, were we will see a increase of transactions of several orders of magnitude in the next 1 - 2 years. This can't be handled by an increase of the blocksize, without making BTC a centralised shitcoin! So I think the increased pressure for a faster LN is needed.

this part is stopping us :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:07:03
How? Even if we rise the blocksize to 100gb my argument still stands. Or aren't you talking about the blocksize?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:46:06
Right, minor transactions should be a goal. But this is what for example the Lightning Dev's try to reach. Let's look how this will work out. Short term, minor transactions (especially in the size of a coffee) aren't needed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:16:26




To have small transactions like coffee on the blockchain would be stupid and destroy decentralisation completly. For this purpose features like the lightning network will hopefully work.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:56:22
How big was the transaction? Atleast now, with $10 for a normal sized transaction should get you easily into the next block. $5 could even suffice.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:01:27


Yes, but also the Core Devs are working at a big number of solutions for this. And what is about the part of the vision, that Bitcoin should be Decentralised to stay uncensorable and uncotrollable for Goverments. Maybe we can keep that up with 4x, but for the Scaling we want (6 Billion users, using it daily) Blocks would need to be so big, that only big datacenters could handle that.


Maybe we can, I'm ok with a sensible increase of blocksize, if we are sure that all nodes can handle it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:53:52
You can test it in testnet with starblocks. I tried it and found it easy to use, atleast not harder than the general bitcoin technology. You just open a channel, wait till it is confirmed and than you just need to scan qr-codes to send your payment.
Edit: To be a bit clear why it is easy: Opening a channel is one button. Sending a payment is scanning a qr code.

My problem with this whole thing is mainly, that CoinBase and co. where also Segwit2X proposers, with the argument their customers want lower fees.

You are right, the learning curve should not be contrained to technically savy persons. But if you want to argue about changes to the protocol, yes, than you should be technically savvy!
It's like this: Yes a car should be usable by even not "car-savvy" persons. But a not "car-savvy" person can't expect people to listen, if he says something like "couldn't you make the engine smaller to save energy".

Do you know how Bitcoins' development works? Ever heard the word consensus? There are way more contributors in the Core Team, and its' development is way more decentralised and not controlled by a small group of people.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:32
Is your question if any crypto currency has a value or why bitcoin has a value in comparison to the other currencies?
To the second point: Bitcoin is decentralized, has a big development team, with robust and well tested software. Also many "cool" feature that other coins have can be implemented in the bitcoin protocol. I believe there were already proposals for smart-contracts (like ETH) or high privacy (like monero).
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:16:28
I meant that off-chain scaling is possible for ETH, but most of it's traffik comes from applications like CryptoKitties. How would you move CryptoKitties and other applications Off-Chain? It's not so clear to me (but i'm sure there are some smart solutions).
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:39:46
I would argue, that a central bank could copy Bitcoin/some crypto to create a new currency. Yes, it would be centralised and would loose the advantages of decentralisation, but it still had the advantages of the blockchain technology. This is for me the main argument, why we need to be careful with centralisation by changing things like the blocksize, because Bitcoin would loose it main distinct "feature" if it would loose decentralisation.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:20:01

I have exactly 0.27$ of BCash, and they don't want to let me sell or withdraw it :( 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:23:02
At the moment it cost me 1.5$ - 5$. And this beside the situation, that we are still in on of the worst situations. With &gt;90% Segwit distribution we would be at probably twice as many transactions per block.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:06:33


See my idea with having a minimal fee so that a transaction count. Miners can do that, but it would be expensive to keep it up long term. For this would a slow linear increase be useful.


I like linear increase, because I'm not sure if the technology improves exponentailly if it's about bandwith. Also we can't see, if in 10 years petabyte storage is normal. There are factors that speak against that.
Also I came from the position that Blocksize increase is not the solution to scale. For this we will need Off-Chain solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:42:41


What? I wouldn't call it "depositing". It's more like taking money out of your account like you would take out cash from your bank account.


Why? You can just open a channel for example to my hub and don't need to give any form of authentication to me. 
Edit: And I forget to read the comment you were answering to, sorry. In this case I only meant, that Central Banks and governments loose their "money printing" privilige. So we undermine this sort of control of this enities.

So if he bought the presents at Bitstamp, he could buy and withdraw for free to the different addresses.
If he have it at a wallet, he could for example use electrum (and probably many other wallets). For electurm you can do this by choosing "Pay to many" of the "Tools" Tab.

When coinbase will let People dump their BCash, there will be a big seller market. Why should anyone pump the Price then? If they pump, then after buying all coinbase coins for "almost free". I believe the price is currently pumped.

But on the site is nothing that answers to my comment I would say. I know how the fee situtation is. It doesn't change my point.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:52:14


Normally I would agree, but not if you have a look at the rest of his comment...


There are several quesitons open:
- How many fullnodes will die if we increase 2x/4x (additionally to the extra strain that Segwit has for this Nodes) over the next months. If it's more than a few % this is problematic.
- Will it stay short-term at this solution? I'm not sure if 2-4x can handle 2018 if the mainstreaming accelerate.
- Will this not bring us to a new split because of the needed hardfork? I'm not sure we need a split at the moment.
Well some big block-guys at BCH are already talking about 1GB and above, because for them other ways of scaling are not near enough at satoshi's original idea.


I would argue, that it will take atleast a month if they hurry. The core-devs will extensively test and review it.
My main reason at the moment for 2x isn't even the fee market (i can still move my bitcoin vor &lt;= 1$). It is more about the point that BCH would immediatly get useless, so all the r/BTC trolls, that are (beside from some ) calling here will probably loose money. :D
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:56:50
Hi, sorry I'm a bit late :/
Did the 2FA authorisation go through? It is probably because of the new traffic, you are right. Or did you maybe misstype something accidently?
GDAX has also free withdrawing. I don't know where you are from, but you can't use GDAX everywhere (including where I am from). So yes they are an alternative, but many people here wold recommend to use something that has uses the Segwit technology at the moment. The advantages are described by other users [here]( So segwit is recommended mostly to support the Bitcoin-Technology.
One point I forgot: If you have Bitcoin on Coinbase and you can use GDAX, you should be able to move your Coins for free to GDAX and than withdraw them for free from there.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:53:15
You never can't be 100% sure that a platform won't be hacked. This is why you don't store your bitcoin on the platform (atleast not a volume u don't care to loose). In the right bar is a link with the title "Storing Bitcoin". Have a look :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:20:58


Well we should do it if we are sure, that almost all full-nodes (way over 90%) can handle the size and traffic (if we know that i would be on board). Also there is still a solution out there that should scale 2x-4x named segwit. I believe, that with all the testing and reviewing core devs need to do, even for a blocksize increase, a high Segwit adoption rate is the faster way to scale.
Decentralization is too important to Bitcoin to loose. I can see a future for a decentralised Bitcoin with short-term high fees and scaling first in long-term solutions. I can't see a future for bitcoin without decentralization. 
Edit: To add to this, a hard fork for bigger block size have a high probability of a new split. I'm not sure if we need that at this moment.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:34:42


That's a stupid argument. Only because something can potentially have more value it's not intelligent to keep it. A smart move is to bet on the horses for which you believe, that it will rise in value. For many people here BCash doesn't seem promising out of various reasons.
Some of my reasons:
- There are Altcoins with better tech than BCash. BCash doesn't have a common history with Bitcoin anymore (the new money bought btc not bch!) so even this isn't an argument anymore.
- I haven't seen any mid- to long-term solution proposals for scaling for BCash. Blocksize increase will not be able to keep up with the demand if we scale up by many orders of magnitude. Also the increase of blocksize will centralise the coin. The main selling point of bitcoin is decentralisation. Fast and cheap, but centralised ways of payment can be copied by governments and banks which would make the coin worthless.
To sum this up: Smart investing isn't keeping something because it could maybe go up. Smart investing is informing yourself about your investment options and choosing the best ones.

Right. And no one says we shouldn't increase the limit as the network grew. See the scaling plan of the core dev's for example. The question is when the time is right. I believe, utilizing the 1MB block first as much as possible (for example 90% Segwit) is important. Else we start to waste the blockspace in the long run.


Don't forget we are in a really early state of development. A good comparison is the 90's internet. Maybe we need more layers, like the Internet. 
It seems to me that full utilization of Segwit would be enough for the current use (and a bit more). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:13:58
A good way could be to not use coinbase, and to use a exchange which uses segwit instead. Some of them are even way cheaper. I like Bitstamp because of this, but I don't know if they are available for you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:39:47
Never understood this reasoning. Even early researchers like Nick Szabo (who many believe could be Satoshi) say that (as one example) off-chain scaling is the better/only solution. Do people not realise that Satoshi is not a prophet, but a scientist, and that scientists will gradually improve their work and not stuck to their holy whitepaper forever.

@_date: 2017-12-13 01:55:21
Transactions on the mainchain of Bitcoin (also LTC, BCash...) has major disadvantages to seller like ebay in comparison to LN. Also the added complexity for LN (which isn't so bad, they don't need to rewrite LN, just use a given solution) shouldn't be a problem for a big software company like ebay. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:08:33
Please learn about setting your own fees and using segwit addresses. This is very helpful.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:57:35
I will not repeat all the arguments against a increase of blocksize here. In short: Blocksize is a temporary solution that destroys one of the main distinct features of bitcoin (decentralisation), that can't be easily copied by anyone (including banks and goverments).
Also if you think big blocks are the solution, why not using Litecoin? It has bigger blocks + segwit + will be lightning ready (which should be a goal of BCash too). BCash hasn't even the advantage of the common history anymore (the flood of new users have Bitcoin and not BCash).
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:04:14
Well, no one knows for sure. So if I would be a company, that could loose profit if LN works out, it could work against it because of this.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:41:12
Adding to the other comments: What many people forget is that Bitcoin is a protocol / software. If there is a distinct feature other coins have, that is demanded, the feature could be added to bitcoin. There are for example implementations like rootstock, that try to add something like the smart contract feature of ETH.


Most of the altcoins have almost no volume in comparison to bitcoin. So they would (like SatoshiPoet already said) run into the same problems. ETH is the only one who has more transactions. It does this by the big price of centralisation. An it still has a average fee at the moment of 0.63 (even 1$ a few days ago). If the price of ETH would go up enough, so that it had the same market cap as bitcoin, this would be about 3 - 5$ in fees.
More interesting are cryptos who aren't using blockchain. For example the tangle coins. They are really trying to be an alternative.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:48:25
I think he means that LN attacks Exchanges. With things like atomic swaps and so on, this could be true.
Edit: To be fair, i forgot to mention that for example coinbase donated money for the development of Lightning. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:12:31
? What type of wallet? If you can set your fees everything under 5$ should suffice.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:39:22
You are right. I just didn't have the feeling to have a exponential scaling with my tech in the last 5 years. But yes, this is probably very subjective.

Well said. If LN works like on the Testnet I'm confident, that Bitcoin can become even the most usable Coin, without destroying decentralisation. It is an way to pay instantly, which on-chain never would be able. Off-Chain will be the only solution for scaling. If you want to do the same scaling with the Blocksize you will rapidly need 1GB Blocks, and at this point you could also use centralized Databases. People shouldn't forget that decentralisation is the main distinct selling point Bitcoin (and BCash, Litecoin, ETH...) has.
With this said, someone should research how for example an increase to 2x will affect the number of full nodes. Maybe most (atleast 95%) of them can handle this traffic. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:40:29
What are you talking about? Did you read my comment? 
I just said (as an answer to your first paragraph where you said "if coinbase themselves steals..."), that it doesn't need to be the case that the company "Coinbase" steals your Bitcoin, but a employee (or a hack). I didn't say that coinbase isn't accountable (but if they are bancrupt, for example if they lost their whole cold storage/s, it will be hard to get anything from them).
Edit: Your example with apple is also not a good comparison. The worst case for apple could be a damage of their image (and some payment to the victim). A hack of a bitcoin-exchange could take the majority of their bitcoin-holding and bancrupt the company (see Mt. Gox).
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:47:23
Seems Fake to me. If you had 1.5 BTC, you could easily buy a hard wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-25 14:31:19


Yes, and at the moment almost anyone agrees to it (see the scaling plan signed by the core devs). But the question is when the right time is. Adding to this, seeing Satoshi's word as a doctrine / him as a "prophet" is just stupid. He was an engineer, and engineers gradually improve their work over time. He would probably have many other stances than he had 6 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:24:01
Normally you should trust big company X. If they don't deliver your Bitcoins than you can sue them. If you can't trust a bigger company than i don't think you can trust someone on localbitcoin to buy 200k of btc. But I think we both agree, that storing this amount on a exchange is stupid, because of hacks and bancrupts.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:59:20
Yes, because it's like saying "We don't use one car to deliver all our articles through the usa. That would be ridicoulus. We use 4!". 
If Amazon or Ebay would come in i see only two solutions in the moment:
- Some other coin that is really ready (and build for) for the amount of traffic. Possible solutions are IOTA (if it will work), Byteball and i heard ripple and stellar could do this too (but haven't looked into it)
- My favorite: Let Ebay and Amazon be the first big users of the Lightning Network. If LN works, this would really make crypto and BTC mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:34:57
I can think of two situations: The victims of the Mt. Gox bacruptcy got atleast a monetary compensation. Also Bitfinex paid back their lost bitcoins from the last hack.
But even if there are no cases, that doesn't mean, it isn't illegal for a company to loose / keep your bitcoins (if they are to blame). And if the company is based in the US you could probably sue them. With Bitcoin becoming mainstream this gets more probable.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:03:08
One question i have in the moment: Would the be irreversibility of transactions be problematic on a platform like ebay? On Amazon i trust the seller to give him my BTC, but i could see crypto on ebay creating a flood of scam.
Edit: A bit old, but replaced the word spam through scam (lukily most of you knew what i meant).
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:22:34
Even if they do, every change on the mainchain will need to be tested extensivly before it will be deployed (we are talking about a 300bln $ chain here). An error like the one in the 2X software would be disastrous. I'm not sure if this development and testing would be ready before LN is. 
Edit: And there are big disadvantages of an increase in blocksize.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:05:49


Currently there is a higher bound how big a channel can become.


No, opening and closing will cost the on-chain fee. The onchain fee will reduce to a feasible level with LN (and a way higher degree of Segwit, which will probably be needed for LN) taking pressure from the main-chain. If that not suffice the blocksize will be increased (see the Scaling plan of core). My last 3 - 5 transactions on the blockchain with Segwit did cost me about 1 - 2$ (even with only 10% distribution of segwit). 
I said they love centralisation (as an exageration), because to keep up with the several orders of magnitude of scaling we need, to archive the goal of using Bitcoin as a day to day currency + "banking for the poor", we need of-chain solutions that. Scaling this much on-chain will destroy decentralisation and with that the main distinct-selling point blockchain cryptos have. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:23:25

Why? In the next months if Coinbase and the other platforms use Segwit, they will use it automatically.


It's optional, but there is a big financial incentive to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:43:27
I didn't say its not absurd. Yes it is volatile. It's a ~20% gain in one day. But the gain of bitcoin this year is still less absurd than the gain of Litecoin. And the whole argument was, that Litecoin is more volatile than Bitcoin. Litecoin has gained ~27000% this year, Bitcoin has gained ~12000% this year. 27000% &gt; 12000%.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:41:33
There are only 2 full nodes that are really used for BCash namely ABC and Unlimited (&gt;99% of all BCash Nodes are ABC or Unlimited Nodes). So I would argue they are the interesting ones. In the following I will also only look at the statistics of 2017 [2][3][4] to conclude how healthy the projects are nowadays.
 of contributor:
bitcoin-abc: 33 people have at least 1 commit. 20 of them have at least 10 commits. BUT: Lets remove all core devs with at least 10 commits (TheBlueMatt, laanwj, theuni, sipa, ryanofsky, morcos, sdaftuar, MarcoFalke, jnewbery, gmaxwell, fanquake, practicalswift, luke-jr), then we are left with 7 devs with at least 10 commits for abc. I count 9 unique contributors that only develop abc. Excluding the commits by core, the abc devs have made 803 commits.
BitcoinUnlimited: 12 contributor with at least 1 commit, 5 with 10 or more commits. Almost no development since mid of this year. I can only see one core dev with 1 commit (fanquake). The BU devs have made 201 commits.
bitcoin: 44 people have at least one commit. 27 of them have at least 10 commits. The core devs have made about 1810 commits this year.
ABC+Unlimited: How is the situation, if we sum up all commits of Unlimited and ABC? 18 distinct contributors have at least 1 commit (excluding core devs). 12 have 10 or more commits. Together they have made 1004 commits this year.
 percentage:
At first I will only look at the portion of single contributers. I will have a look at affiliations later. I will also only describe the top-contributors to the point of 90% of all commits.
bitcoin-abc: 68% of all commits (excluding the core-commits) are by deadalnix. schancel and ftrader are at ~10%.  So 3 devs are responsible for almost 90% of all commits. 
bitcoin-unlimited: ptschip is responsible for ~47% of all commits, followed by gandrewstone with ~23%, sickpig with ~11%, kyuupichan with ~8% and allanDoensen with ~5%. The top 4 contributors are responsible for almost 90% of all commits.
bitcoin: You need at least 20 contributors to capture 90% of all commits. The top contributor this year is jnewbery with ~14% of all commits, followed by TheBlueMatt with ~11%, practicalswift with ~10%, laanwj with ~7%, sipa with 7%, morcos with 5%, ryanofsky with 5%, jonasschnelli with ~5% and thuni with ~4% (still 77 commits). Each of the contributor  to  are responsible for 1-3% (corresponding to 25-55 commits).
ABC+Unlimited: The top 7 contributor are responsible for almost 90% of all commits. The top 5 for ~80%, the top 3 for ~72%. Even with all commits of ABC and Unlimited combined deadalnix is responsible for 55% of all commits! (Fun-Fact: 7 bitcoin contributor have more commits then all ABC+Unlimited contributor except deadalnix).
 and decentralization:
6 core-contributor are affiliated with Chaincodelabs. Together they are responsible for ~41% of all commits. 5 are affiliated with Blockstream, responsible for ~14%. laanwj and theuni are affiliated with the MIT Media Lab and are responsible for 11.44%. 33.59% has either no affiliation or they are currently unknown to me. 
Alone deadalnix commit share (for ABC+Unlimited) is higher than the one of all Chaincodelabs-Devs combined. This situation is much worse than the one at the core repository. We don't even know who exactly sponsors deadalnix. He said that he got a sponsorship by the bitcoin development grant [6], which is supported by Bitmain, Bitcoin.com etc. [7]. You only need 7 contributor to reach 90% off all commits of ABC and Unlimited. Their affliation is completly unknown to me. I would argue, that it is way easier for companies to manipulate a project that is so centralized in it's developer structure (buy the 3 top contributors of ABC and you have almost all active Cash Node developers on your side).
 TL;DR:
Bitcoin Cores' development in the year 2017 was way more decentralized than ABC + Unlimited (&gt;99% of all BCash Nodes are ABC or Unlimited Nodes). 41%  of all commits for Core were made by contributors affiliated with Chaincodelabs. In comparison: 55% of all commits of ABC + Unlimited (combined) are by one single contributor who has a sponsorship by the bitcoin development fund (supported by Bitmain, Bitcoin.com and others).
Disclaimer: My calculations [5] could be wrong. I'm also probably missing many affliations, so if someone wants, she/he can have a look at my spreadsheet [ You can switch between the different sheets for Bitcoin, ABC, Unlimited and ABC + Unlimited at the bottom of the page.

People often forget how early the development state is at the moment. I like Andreas comparison with the "Internet of money" in the sense, that BTC is in a state of the 90's internet.

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:35:37
Wrong. Even a store of value need to scale if we are gaining several orders of magnitudes of new users, but not as fast.
Also most people here are for store of value + currency when better scaling methods like LN are here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:42:56
How does that have to do anything with this thread? Everyone knows about the fees, we have millions of threads the last few days. Solution is at the moment to increase the blocksize! By using Segwit - Services.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:42:31
Yeah, but a) you need to look at the percentage and b) compare btc gain this year with ltc's gain. LTC's gain stomps BTC's gain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:09:37


No, they belong to the basic idea of Bitcoin.


More about 1 - 2$ if you use Segwit and can wait for a few hours (like propably almost any tx at the moment, because the mempool is filled by people that are buying in and trying to move their bitcoin). Sadly you can't choose your fees freely on many platforms.
And right, but Bitcoin is still in development. To reach the goal of banking the unbanked we need to find a way to scale about several order of magnitude. This will only be possible off-chain, without destroying decentralisation.


I don't believe, that many people that where hodling for years or that are coming in at the moment are interested in other practical senses. Till now all this is a "get-rich-quick" theme for them. To change that, you need to make buying with Bitcoin easier. I liked the usability of LN in the test-net to buy me fake-coffee (best coffee there is), so I think this is the way to go (instant and easy to use).
Also to move to another crypto you would need a point why to do this. Most of them have no adoption rate, so you can't really use them as anything but store-of-value. Even with Bitpay on your side, there aren't many possibilities at the moment to use your coins. I believe LN could change that! It's just the dream for merchants, if it will work like in the testnet or the demo's on the mainnet.
But I see, that this is short- to midterm problematic because the moment BTC will collapse especially the new people will probably not switch to another coin. They will just say "See this whole crypto coin thingy was a bubble. Why did I even put money in it." This will hurt the market for years.

You could argue that computer scientists are engineers to a big portion ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:57:26


That's such an idiotic argument. Satoshi was an engineer, not a prophet. A engineer will gradually improve his work over the years. And an engineer knows that the simplest solution isn't always the smart one.
Even early researchers like Nick Szabo (who many believe could be Satoshi, he developed, he developed Bit Gold, a decentralised crypto in the year 1998!) say that (as one example) off-chain scaling is the better/only solution. Hal Finney (crypto researcher, first one to receive Bitcoin by Satoshi) did also argue, that on-chain scaling is impossible.
BCash is technically inferior to Bitcoin and many other alternatives. Have for example a look at litecoin: Same tx/s, Segwit probably first coin to be LN ready (LN should be a big goal for BCash to). Or Ethererum who has a Smart Contract platform. BCash have even lost the advantage of a common history with Bitcoin. The only thing they have currently is the name.
The solution to scale with blocksize increase, has the big disadvantage of centralisation of the coin. Maybe one time 4x is ok (but even for this many nodes will die), but the plans for BCash doesn't seem to hold at 4x, some are talking about &gt;1gb blocks. And yes if you want to scale onchain you need this huge blocks. This is why onchain is so stupid. In the end, only big companies can run nodes in datacenters. And even they will have a problem if we scale to 6 billion people who make 5 - 20 tx per day. Than you 
suddenly need 300gb blocks every 10 minutes.  All in all, blocksize increases will destroy decentralisation. 
And decentralisation is the main distinct selling point of Bitcoin! Every government and bank could simply copy the blockchain technology (and bitcoin code) and make it centralised or just propose a centralised system like paypal without relevant fees (i can see them doing that to destroy Bitcoin and cryptos). A government banning mining could be a way bigger problem than it would be now. Furthermore decentralisation is even a main selling point against many other cryptos! I would even argue, that the way the core dev's try to scale is way nearer at the vision Satoshi describes in his whitepaper: that Bitcoin should be decentralised to stay uncensorable and uncotrollable for Goverments. 
Also BCash has at the moment only such a small fee, because almost no one uses it. Even LTC has a  twice as big.
Other huge problems of BCash at the moment: Their advocates. I would argue, that a big portion of the price comes from the support of salesman like Ver and FakeSatoshi (why is he even allowed to speak at conferences etc. and posted at r/BTC, it's ridiculous) and miners (who clearly only support BCash out of self interest) like Jihan. I would never follow such people. They clearly act only to pump and later dump their coin. How centralised is the ownership of BCash? If Ver really sold all his BTC, he probably has 300.000 - 1 Million coins. Do you really want such a person to hold this high control?  
To end this, one last point: Do BCash believer really believe, that if they kill Bitcoin, this will be a good thing for crypto? How do you believe the whole newbies, banks that are coming in and media will react? They will not say "ohh yeah, we will now have a look at a different crypto". No, they will blow it as "Crypto" is dead and can't work. This will throw Crypto back by many years.
TL;DR: Satoshi would agree: He is a engineer not a prophet. And sometimes engineers need to take the hard right way to improve their technology not the simple one.
(I call the by the core dev's developed Blockchain here Bitcoin, and 'Bitcoin Cash' BCash. Not out of spite, but I still hope, that they will do the best thing for BCash and Crypto: Trying to work alongside Bitcoin. Because of this I believe BCash is the better and even catchier name)
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:02:07
You are right, but this argument can be used against any method to unclog the blockchain. And Segwit is already there and will be necessary for Lightning (if my informations are right here). So i would say trying to first get a big segwit adoption rate is the smart move here.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:13


You did read the news about LN right? The core team didn't dropped  cheap transactions. But their opinion is, that simply increasing the blocksize would be no solution for the scaling that is needed in the future (if you want your coin to stay decentralised).
And with the free bank transfer an so on you gave an example why loosing or weakening the dencentralisation is bad. If you just want a centralized, cheap payment system bitcoin an no other crypto wouldn't have a advantage over this platforms (Visa, Paypal, ...).
Also moving money with bitcoin on chain is still cheap, if you think about higher volumes and international bank transfers.

Which exchanges let you directly withdraw into a Bech32 address? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:43:35
Why this shitcoin? There are thousands other shitcoins. Many are even cheaper than BCash :) 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:53:27
Other smaller coins are a "playground" in comparison to btc. They have not a market cap of bitcoin. Also if bitcoin will fail / have a bug this will be dangerous for the whole crypto market. Or do you really believe the "noobs" and bankers out there will trust another crypto immediatly if btc fails. This are all reasons why the core-devs are very careful.
Yes, the cost of running full nodes will increase. But worse is that many full-nodes will die / get taken down because of limits like brandwith and processing speed. But full nodes are extremly important for the decentralisation of bitcoin. And without decentralisation Bitcoin would loose one of its main selling point. If you only have the selling point "free and fast" transactions, it is easy for the old banking system to attack that by creating a similiar system (for consumers paypal seems to do this already), which will cost them nothing to do. Also the network will be way easier to attack by goverments and the centralised miners.
Also the question is if rising the block size to 2x or 4x will really suffice. Long-Term it is impossible to scale with increasing the block size (you would need blocks way bigger than 10gb every 10 minutes to mainstream). I think creating pressure on the developers to bring out a solution that hopefully can scale is needed. I also hope, that now companies and users will start using segwit, because a high segwit rate should help short term with scaling.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:56
It does almost nothing better. Every shitcoin has almost no fees and fast transactions. That's simply because no one uses it.
Problems with BCash are weaker security, no real scaling solution for several orders of magnitude that we will see in the future, stronger centralisation etc. 
If they really wanted to make a better Bitcoin they would have taken Segwit and maybe even added a (at least short-term) asic-proof algorithm. But this would be directly against the incentive of the handful of people who coordinated this hardfork. At the moment there are several coins which are better than BCash. They have even lost the advantage of the common history with bitcoin, because most of the new money was invested in Bitcoin, not BCash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:10:41
No, Bitcoin has it value as a decentralised and limited currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:53:57
Why not try to create a good crypto currency instead of spreading FUD against another crypto? I think the best thing for the whole BCH project is, that they stop trying to become the "real bitcoin" and put this energy into improving their coin. Maybe the project should really remove Bitcoin from their name, and use BCash to distinct themselves from BTC! This would show confidence, that BCash is more than just a shilled hard fork by the big players like Ver and Jihan.

If you can make such a list, than you should also sell your Bitcoins. Again: If you invest in any coin (or stay invested), you should research if it's worth it. If you think a coin has no place, then sell it. I still have a big list of reasons to keep my bitcoin (decentralisation, one of the most active development / research, many brilliant developers, brilliant proposals / implementations like segwit, lightning, mast and so on, strongest brand, most widely-spread, etc.). I have almost no such reasons for an altcoin like BCash, but a list of disadvantages (and yes the big names supporting BCash are also one, because they are one of the driving forces behind the current price beside the bitcoin-brand).


Possible. But don't forget that crypto is software / protocols. So as long something isn't completly changing their technology (like IOTA, if it works), all other coins can try to copy their advantages. So with all Blockchain-Coins out there, if one has a distinct feature, that the users want, Bitcoin could try to copy it (for example anonymity or smart contracts).
But I am still invested in some of them, because i can see more then one chain winning. But this chains need to have distinct features from each other (why are they the best with feature X? ). Also you are right, I can't see the future, therefore I hold alternatives, that currently have advantages over other coins (why should some coin without advantages win long-term?). Still, i can name almost no advantages of BCash if i compare it to some other coins out there. 


But the data is there in form of informations about the coins. 
With your argumentation you should buy every shitcoin out there, because it maybe could be the winning horese. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:09:44
I don't believe that even 1% of the newbies coming in, want really use the Bitcoin. This is problematic, but maybe gives time to find real scaling solutions for this use cases (even 8x wouldn't be enough if we all want to buy things several times a day).
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:21:07


What do you mean by this?
- Do you mean the miners? I think BCash having the same Algorithm as Bitcoin is a weakness. An example of this weakness was the nead for the EDA. Also it seems to me, that the huge Hashing-Power that is already there make BCash easier attackable by a 51% attack (could be wrong here). If they really wanted to make a better coin they should have taken a new Algorithm to make their coin (atleast short-term) ASIC free, but i think Jihan wouldn't have liked that.
- Wallets etc. needs to be specific for BCash, right?
- Reusing Core code is also possible for many other Altcoins.
I think for example LTC has only advantages over BCash by having a similiar compatibility to the BTC Code, Segwit (and probably the fastest adoption of LN), Scrypt and atleast as many TX's per minute. BCash has even lost the advantage of a common history with BTC, because all the new money have bought BTC and not BCH.
I think you could keep BCH to the point that Ver etc. will fail to further pump their Shitcoin. It is hard to guess when this will be, maybe if coinbase dumps it BCash.


Because no one uses it :D

Ohh, right, i din't think about this solution. This seems to be the only solution which will not change the bitcoin protocol directly. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:32:03


Why? I don't see why i can't say, that the current situation is fine for "store of value", but hopefully in mid-term we extend the usability and make BTC to one of the first (and maybe only) crypto wo can really be used as a currency, because it really scales (with the hope, that LN brings several order of magnitude to the possible transactions, which is needed for real mainstream adoption) without destroying the main distinct feature a crypto named decentralisation. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:12:05
A. Satoshi developed BTC 8 Years ago. His idea was brilliant, but even he couldn't tell what will happen nowadays.
B. On-Chain scaling by increasing the blocksize is a very problematic solution. It will kill/reduce decentralisation, which makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place.
C. If we get to the future where everyone use crypto daily, on chain scaling is simply impossible. We aren't talking about an increase to 64mb (which would kill decentralisation immediatly) but &gt;10GB blocks every 10 minutes, that would be necessary. There needs to be a off-chain-alternative, and the BCash-Community should be supporting LN (and Segwit) as strongly as Bitcoin does, if they believe/hope that Crypto will be mainstream someday.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:00:04
I'm not an expert with ETH. But it seems to me, that an off-chain solution will not be possible, because they have all this interesting applications on the chain, like crypto kittens and so on. I'm interested if it will be possible for them to keep up with the demand without a centralisation movement on their blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:42:08
I think amazon wouldn't care about the purpose. Also isn't Byteball  made for Payments (Their slogan is "Byteball — smart payments made simple")? So payments for amazon would be exactly what they want. I also think that IOTA (and Byteball) is not ready. I'm not sure if there is even a currency that is ready to take real world level of transactions.
Will litecoin, vertcoin and so on not have the same problem as bitcoin if they get enough traffic? They are working now, because almost no one use them. I believe LTC can have 56 tx's per second. The question is if that would be enough (mid term). I don't think amazon want's to reimplement their interface every time a coin fails.
I'm a bit more optimistic with the release of LN. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:20:36


Well you said you could make a list like mine. And mine argued, why BCash has no place. So i thought you have a list of arguments why Bitcoin has no place. Maybe a misunderstanding on my side.


I didn't say that. Maybe there was a misunderstanding (or i phrased something wrong), if so then sorry.


No, if your think the negatives are strongly outweighed by the positives you should invest / keep it. If the negatives strongly outweighed the positives, you don't invest or get rid of it.


Also, i did never say that that any coins have no disadvantages. But i have a look at the technology, community, developers etc. and make a educated decision (by weighing pro and cons and comparing them to other coins).


On what data are you waiting? If you say the data isn't there that, wouldn't that mean you are gambling at the moment? I don't think so, you also research into a coin and decide. If you would invest in a startup, you also would only have their business-idea and plan and would decide on that in the hope that you get a high return. In this terms Cryptos compare to Startups, you take a high risk investment into something of which you believe will have a bright future. But you would still not invest in a startup, if you think the cons outweigh the pros. You would also not keep your current amount X invested in this startup (that you somehow got for free) if you think it cons outweigh it pros, because this means you believe this company will not make it into the future (and you loose your money). 
Or are you waiting on a clear market move so that Bitcoin or BCash will loose almost all it's value? If so selling would be too late.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:38:22
Yes, i still think informing new users should be a goal to help with segwit adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:17:07
Yes, but we can substain the miner with the current power level. We don't need much more. 
Adding to this: From a environmental sight this is bad, yes. But why should the miner care as long as they are making profit (it's still capitalism)? If the price of energy rises, they will simply adapt their mining hardware. Mining will just go on. 
Adding to this: LN and Segwit could potentially increase the number of transaction with a factor of 1000 or higher. This could be a solution.
Edit: Also here is maybe a misunderstanding on your side (sorry if i just misunderstood you), so to make it a bit clearer: The power consumption doesn't rise linear with the number of transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:35:45
I don't know how this would make sense. If 1 BTC is at 100.000 then there needs to be a market of people buying in at 100.000 and then you can sell to them.

@_date: 2017-12-09 20:28:14
Seems fake to me. Maybe I am missing some information, but how do you accidently send BTC to some claimed address? If you made a type error the probability that you hit a address that is already in use is at ~0% (there is atleast a space of 2160 adresses and maybe 1 million used adresses)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:43
No, alone all transactions inside corporations and between corporations will start a LC to save money. The second point is with Segwit we would be easily fast enough to take on the current 10 transactions per second that are added to the mempool. And the last point is, that many people some day need to move their coin, and will probably open a channel in the same step. This in combination with LN will accelarate the decrease of fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:47:25
I mean not on predicting the future. I mean about the cryptomarket. I mean


That is not how it works. A. It's not like you could now take 2k in the hand and mine a bitcoin. It takes a big investment to be able to compete in the mining market. B. The cost of mining gold is also way less than the price of gold. So why is that? Because starting an mining business will cost you millions. So this argument isn't incorrect, even if you are correct with your prediction that Bitcoin will crash, the mining cost have nothing to do with this.
Also to your point about "high transaction costs". They are problematic, but: A. They are still low if you look at higher volumes and international transactions. Try to move &gt;50k to the other side of the planet for a fee &lt;10$. And this in less than 12 hours. B. The last week was expensive (i paid 3$ for my last transaction), but overall almost all my transactions in the last months were under 1$. C. There are brilliant technological solutions for the problem. And as long as there aren't so many businesses accepting bitcoin a few of 1$ should be ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:29:44

I hope in the last 2 hours the market didn't move so strong, that you weren't talking about ETH at the moment of this post :D
If I have a look at [this]( site, the average fee of ETH at the moment is at 0.83$. BTC has a 4x market-cap in comparison to ETH. So wouldn't ETH if they get to the same market-cap. as BTC have a fee of 3.32$? This wouldn't be so nice either :)

I could see this grow stopping if it will not be needed for consumers anymore. In this case I was talking about storage. I'm not sure if we need exponential more storage for 50 years. What could become so big? Will for example the  resolution of Movies and Games increase exponential? If we take a 100" TV maybe there is a max. pixelrate at the point that the human eye can't distinct it anymore. 
Maybe we should stay conserativly here, and change only if needed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:16:09


Well if miner X spams this fee and miner Y collects it X will have lost the money. In a partly free market atleast some pools wouldn't work with the miners that tries to spam and would collect their fees. With increasing blocksize, this loss will become bigger, because more transactions are needed. The min should be big enough to hurt the miner if they loose 20 - 30% of this. So this is why i had the thought to reduce it somehow with the increasing price (but this seems hard, therefore we may just reduce it constantly for 10 years).
But yeah, I see how this plan could backfire. But is increasing the blocksize over 10 years to 8MB really so problematic? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:21:34

I will never understand how anyone can trust into Fake-Satoshi's words or let him speak at a event. Please, alone that he is on your side should at least annoy you.
His claim sounds like bullshit. A: You would need giant servers which can store about 20 PETA-Bytes per year. B: Also the bandwith needs to be enourmous (think about it: 380gb every 10 minutes). This would be hard for a centralized mega server. It would be impossible for a dencentralized net of nodes. Maybe he is talking about how big a block could be solely on base of computing power? (i am not even sure about that).
TL;DR Just assume Fake-Satoshi is always talking out of his ass ;)
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:11:12
Yes there were, but mainly discussed by the early engineers and not so publicly known.
All other blockchains face the exact same problems. So my comment works for every other blockchain coin. And for other coins like the tangle-coins we are even in an earlier development state. 
I hold not only BTC, because I believe that more than one chain will survive. Im invested in tangle-coins and interesting block-chain coins like ETH or LTC. I still believe in Bitcoin as one of the surviving chains, because various reasons like adoption rate, brand-recognition, the developer team etc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:59:15


My last transaction, about 12 hours ago had a fee of 3$. And if i have a look at the fee market at the moment (which is way better), i think &lt;1.5$ would be enough (with &lt; 6hours)
Edit: To be fair, i don't know exactly how BitPay works. But they are probably giving you a adress and you are sending bitcoin to them, right? So the fee should be the market fee. Also, does the transaction need to be in the next block? If yes i can see how the transactionfee are so high. In my last 10 transactions before the with 3$ i never paid more than 1$.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:31:53
$200.000 o.O That's a huge amount of money. I hope for you, that this is really a amount you are willing to loose, or atleast survive a crash like the one from 2013 (down 89% for 2 years) without problems.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:44:58
A. You need to use a wallet that uses segwit. Segwit Transactions are smaller, and because of that you need to pay less.
B. You need a wallet, that allows you to make a Transaction with more than one output. This means you can do more than one transaction in one. The size of such a transaction is way smaller, then it would be if you would do all of them in single transactions.
Electrum allows you both. As example: A few days ago I wanted to donate about 25$ to 4 different organizations (each between 3x 7$, 1x 4$) and send the rest to a change address. I did all of this in one transaction. Because i bundled it I paid a fee of 2.74$ for all of this. If I would have done a single transaction for all of them, i would probably had to pay &gt;6$  
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:50:41
I think it will be a steady progress with some of the next important Milestone being &gt;90% Segwit-distribution, Lightning, Mast, Schnorr-Signatures etc. I'm not an expert, and am still learning too (i believe even veterans are :) ), so especially the order could be wrong. I first started reading the IRC-Logs of the core dev meetups this week. But [here]( is atleast the rough roadmap how the core-devs want to scale.
I like the comparison by Andreas, that Bitcoin / Crypto is in the state of the 90's internet. We are still in a really early state.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:09


Nice, that you suggest that, but this isn't as simple as you think. You should start to inform yourself about the problems with on-chain scaling. Also you should have a look at "exponential"-scaling methods (simply impossible on the chain, at the current state of tech, without loosing decentralisation completly. Even centralised i think blog &gt;1gb are too much.). Then there are other thinks you seemingly have a lag of understanding for:


Bitcoin is already hundreds-of-billions-of-dollar big! This means, that changes are never simply added, they will need to be tested and reviewed extensively. A bug in Bitcoin could have disastrous effects on the whole crypto-currency-universe. Also you seem to think changing the blocksize is some sort of easy adjustment everyone could do. Did you have a look at the changes 2x needed to do? This is something that needs to be done carefully by someone knowledgeable (Garzik tried and even he had problems in the end).


Could you argue what your problem with this technologies are?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:58:44
Or you just don't spend more than you can afford to loose :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:58:59
I think a good comparison for this argument is like in many cases the early internet.
In the 90's many people said "Email is no proper way of communication, because almost no one has it". This is the same as saying "Bitcoin has no purchasing power, because almost no one accept it.". Both is in a very early state of development and distribution. Both is brilliant tech, that has the potential to revolutionize the world.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:48:37
It is not good.
So at first about buying from coinbase. You should think about using another exchange, because they are way cheaper. I for example use Bitstamp, it let's me deposit money for free over SEPA (I'm from europe), buy with a fee of only 0.25% (buy price is often way better than on Coinbase) and most important: No withdrawing fees (because bitstamp pay the bitcoin-network fees for you).
Alternatives, if you can't use Bitstamp where you are from, are Gemini and maybe Bitflyer (didn't test it myself). Gemini for example has no withdrawing fees for 30 withdraws a month. You will save a large sum of money with one of this platforms. 
Storing Bitcoin on jaxx is better than storing them on a exchange like coinbase. If you have a bigger amount of money in Bitcoin (I would say &gt;5000$) a hardwarewallet should be worth a look. It is way safer against hacker (and some other advantages). There are also other ways to store your bitcoin like Paper Wallets. Have a look at this article: 
If you have more questions look in the sidebar here in this subreddit or ask me and other more experienced users here in this subreddit (you can PM me :) if you have other questions).
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:50:52
Yes, exactly! This is what i tried to say, I may not have expressed myself clearly. All of your given options are very problematic e.g. for Coinbase. In another comment Akasirus claims, that Coinbase is only insured for 2%, which would mean a full hack would also make the second option useless. So this shows, despite Coinbase being accountable (and sueable) if they have lost your bitcoin, the probability (in case of such a full hack) of you getting your money back is really low.

Or try to help, if you're technical savvy enough :) 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:06:50


Bullshit. Fees between 75 - 90 sat / byte are cleared. Assume you pay 90 sat / byte, a simple Segwit-enabled transaction has a size of 141 Bytes. So the fee is 12690 satoshi (0.1269mbtc), at a price of 14200$  (14.2$/mbtc) this equals to a fee of 1.8$.
And this despite that we are still in a worst-case situation. If we had a 100% Segwit distribution we would probably have blocks who can (atleast) handle twice the amount of transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:26:37

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:10:11
So it atleast seems to work in small channel networks:
(and it's cool to use, tried it on testnet)
But yes, LN needs to be tested, we don't know if it will work out. At least the theory seems convincing to me. Also i currently see no other real solution to  scale Bitcoin (and LTC, Bcash...), so i would be pessimistic about the future of crypto if LN fails (atleast for blockchain-crypto).


Thats a hard one. I believe (or quoting Andreas here :) ) that crypto is in the state of the 90's internet. And the vision for the future is, that even "normal" people will use crypto daily, but this is only possible with major improvements in the user interfaces. But in my opinion it would be ok, if Amazon adds Crypto Support, with the current sort of user interfaces. We are still at the start of Crypto, improvements can be made over time.

See the argumentation of Andreas over [her](


Like i said, off-chain scaling is a potential solution. Maybe sidechaining etc. What many people forget is, Bitcoin isn't set in stone and can be enhanced. It is a protocol / piece of software.


I would too argue, that in this moment the price is to high for the developing state of the software. But in 5 -10 years i really believe that the crypto market will be way bigger than the gold market. Till then it may suffice to stay a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:35:49
The solution is not only that you will pay less. If everyone uses segwit we will get exactly what many here want: about 2x more transactions per block.
Also I think 1$ is ok at the moment. Almost everyone is moving his money between saving accounts and so on. You don't buy daily (, or you are a big exception). So lets wait for LN.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:39:36
I hope so! It's one of the big advantages crypto has over banking: Everyone can have access to a form of banking.
But: At the moment this is not needed. We first need to find a long-term solution for scaling. Hopefully off-chain solutions will help. After this we can look if we can bring banking to the poor.
