bruh but rule n°1 is more like don't fall in love with an investment right ? Don't tell people to burn their money. nobody knows what will happen tomorrow, and the solution isnt always buy buy buy when it gets lower
@_date: 2019-10-03 05:21:09
XD ikr but it is very interesting and i learned new stuff so that's cool !
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:26:29
Er well what do you mean with Lightning network for "private" ?
The fact that anybody could know my transactions is weird
And the 70% market cap - good reason, for investing. It doesn't mean it's the best coin that offers the best solutions.
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:35:46
i know. but the Web was without big competition.
Here i am talking about the fact that there may be better options (i mean Lightning Network could change things but anyway)
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:47:23
well i guess that's pseudo anonymity no ? Coins like Monero offer full privacy if i got that right
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:59:42
so you say btc wouldn't be for spending, more for holding and investing right ?
On the other hand, xmr is the coin to go with for darknet etc, though i think privacy should be fundamental
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:51:26
what ? are you talking about btc or xmr there (1, 2, 6) ?
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:48:01
so would "lightning network" compete to bitcoin cash ?
@_date: 2019-10-02 17:02:30
i get your point. but i mean: still, all this is integrated by default in monero in better
@_date: 2019-10-02 17:14:44
well i never heard of LN - but it actually sound very interesting. If it really makes the network that faster and lowers the fees i would really consider buying btc.
But what about the limited amount of bitcoins ?
@_date: 2019-10-03 05:23:16
Thank you !
If LN works fine as i said in another comment then i also think bictoin will be the only coin. Right now though i still believe in ethereum and monero
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:08:03
uh ? I guess I misread the fact that satoshi called it "peer to peer electronic cash" in his whitepaper ?
"  A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash "
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:17:19
yep. using it irl, not just buying and never spend
@_date: 2019-12-20 06:08:14
Bruh ur right
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:02:26
But you cannot say in a generalised way that btc is better than stocks
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:44:58
lmao - that is some solid argument, you sound like someone I can trust
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:13:34
why do people downvote this ? 
guess most here are just for the $, not actual technological revolution and seeing crypto used daily ?
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:11:30
Actually I was surprised to see one page which is talking about money in my economy book in school telling about bitcoin- only one article, but still, and actually informative
The economy course is still focused on keynesianismus ofc..
@_date: 2019-12-15 17:14:24
Govs own to private lenders through bonds, but also to other countries etc.
Private people mostly to banks I guess
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:30:50
no fees ?
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:18:37
I never said I didn't believe in btc. I believe you can have both crypto and stocks.
However blindly saying "buy btc - hodl - price down ? buy the dip - " etc etc doenst help to get a message accross. Just like stating points as above without arguments won't make people change their mind.
Also, stop saying "everyone who doesn't own at least few sats by now is betting against the the power of the internet/people"
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:51:32
Prices or people ?
@_date: 2019-12-14 20:33:55
r/community i guess lmao
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:21:50
ikr, what is this supposed to tell us ?
@_date: 2019-12-22 10:19:12
sso kB and KB is not the same ? i just knew about kbit and kb not being the same
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:39:04
Not good
@_date: 2019-12-22 06:51:59
Slowly perhaps, if people get to understand fiat.
In a complete crash however, btcs price would go down
@_date: 2019-12-10 11:50:37
Ok then. If you plan on holding your btc a Desktop Wallet should be safe (except for very much value).
Download electrum wallet, it is open source and you control your keys
Then just send your bitcoins from coinbase to your electrum wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-19 06:26:24
And ? It still isn't fungible.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:50:12
stocks don't exist ? wut ?
@_date: 2019-12-15 17:07:12
Yeah, still not enough
@_date: 2019-12-11 21:33:36
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:55:41
Exactly that is what I meant. OA says btc is better than stocks. 
My question was : How ?
@_date: 2019-12-22 10:32:20
ok so kibi is 10\^3 and kilo is 2\^10 ? Cool
edit : other way round i guess
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:18:56
Salty, but refreshing and showing aomething other than glorified stats
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:09:21
Yay let's censore people with opinions !
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:22:34
why would you wanna stop em ? socialism ? no, thank you but no
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:55:42
same goes for btc I guess, you could say : "uh that is just some random letters and numbers that you call a key and that is money ? "
You own a little proportion of a company. That ownership is given to you through your broker, and guaranteed by the law.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:54:07
Well yes that is the safer way but it depends on how much you want to hold.
@_date: 2019-12-21 11:08:00
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:38:23
saying there wont be stocks anymore is like saying there wont be any corporations anymore. Nonsense. This does not mean that I ain't skeptical towards fiat and debt-based money and economy, states that fck off their economy into inflation etc..
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:46:49
They are completely different. You take 10 years of BTC chart compared to your 7-8%
First your return depends. Second, if you got into btc 10 years ago, I clap, but if you got into 2 years ago youre return isnt that nice I guess..
@_date: 2019-12-21 12:13:01
Yep thats my thought too
@_date: 2019-12-24 13:29:49
But I know a better coin
@_date: 2019-12-14 20:05:23
oh if you wanna do some lessons on fiat, no more gold backed or now we are in crisis ok, but this is not in the graph. it needs more than a simple graph with boomer on it to make a statement with actual meaning
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:31:42
xD I mean I do get your point. And yes, I am learning about bitcoin and blockchain (3blue1brown video, and recently started reading the bitcoin standart)
That doesnt mean stocks are bad though, that is what economy and investments rely on.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:13:59
Explain then
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:51:04
the thing is you leave the control of your savings to a central institution. look at venezuela and other failed fiats  
plus : the current system after keynes is quite unhealthy i guess, all you get is debt. and over time you need to grow to pay debt, so you need more money in the market, more debt and more debt and blabla  - it crushes
also : not all crypto are deflationary- xmr for example is inflationary (for now at least) with minimum of 0.3 xmr block reward.
@_date: 2019-12-14 13:39:45
@_date: 2019-12-11 21:32:43
Yeah you wont control a company owning some shares, but you got the concept.
And for btc I was doing (or lets say trying) this exact thing : Making uninformed critique, blindly throwing out ideas. Cause that is what I felt when he talked about stocks.
@_date: 2019-12-10 08:11:27
In that case why would you look for an online wallet ?
I guess "not your keys not your coins"
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:49:18
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:06:47
"So stop selling godamnit !"
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:49:17
well, they create money when giving out loans, and "destroy" it when these loans get payd back.
And they owe you money. You don't give them your money when you deposit it right ? They loan it from you, and give you interests on it.
(i'm not an expert or so however)
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:02:52
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:43:35
@_date: 2019-12-20 06:07:12
Yep... If one day the price goes up that much it will be cause it replaced fiat
