jesus christ you see the price now? it's insane eh. why the huge rise in price? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:29:11
come on baby!! keep going down! waiting for the big dip
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:28:20
done. So i went from 1.3 to 1.4 now i have 1.07 btc... Day trading is no fun. Feel like theres always gonna have dips here and there. maybe ill try once again  
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:12:18
alright man i trust you and i have time to wait for a dip anyway. thanks as always 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:26:40
the price is up quite a bit. you sure there's gonna be a dip? and when?
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:14:25
Yeah, what I've been trying to do is sell when it hits a peak, buy at next dip. Not really day trading, more long term swing trading. 
Dollar cost averaging is safe for sure. 
Where would I go to get an investor for btc? bitcoinmarkets? Seems risky to get an investor for bitcoin, but that is a great idea. 
- HODL. what i should ve done in the first place. 
Also, thought mining was useless nowadays. Would be paying more for energy consumption than the reward of btc. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:31:32
if you say so!
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:28:08
lost .4 btc 2 weeks ago... :(
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:48:04
ahh ok. what do you think it'll dip to? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:22:11
like trade with huge leverage? kinda like forex trading? seems risky, don't know why i'd do margin trading when i could trade with $4000 or 1ish bitcoin. I guess potential for huge profits/losses. 
And sure, I'll talk to your guy. What's kik? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:18:22
jesus christ man. should i just buy now and cut my losses? it keeps going up like crazy
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:34:24
I see. You think btc will still be stable after the fork ? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:17:23
where do you see it dropping to? got 4.7k $CDN sitting on quadriga waiting to buy btc
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:56:43
True. Unless it never dips to your buy amount. I know you can adjust it though
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:37:52
Wow, sorry to hear. I'll have to be careful. The incoming hard fork is what got me into day-trading. Hoping to just sell high, and buy low, when and if it crashes hard. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:16:49
Nice, I'm 25. Where you from in canada? I'm from Sarnia area. But wow, I'll have to transfer my coins to bitfinex. hows' the verification period?
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:07:14
wow, nice. You ever do FOREX trading? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:52:09
you think the ride is over? traders are cashing out now? Is that what you did? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:46:36
you are always on the ball.. Thanks for the tips
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:44:16
I don't know if it's a good exchange. Not much choice as a Canadian, and there's no other exchange to compare it to since it's the only one I'm on. I've heard mixed reviews about it though. 
And I see. Well I'm a new reddit user, still learning how it works here. Thanks for your input. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:03:30
Do you think there's people that do pump and dumps? You think the high price is caused by pump and dump people or just the result of the segwit and BIP activation? Are you pretty well experienced in crypto trading? And, you think the price is gonna rise again after 6 hour dip? sorry for all the questions. I'm gonna sell here now too. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:17:18
Just sold my btc, now waiting for a big drop. I actually took advantage of the previous big dip a couple days ago. I've been day-trading for a few days now, and it's mentally tough and emotional. You win some, you lose some... Because the price is so volatile and there's constant dips, I can afford to wait a few days so that I make a profit. Anyway, hope to see the big dip soon. Thanks for your input sir. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:20:52
good point. it's also mentally draining.. day-trading is no fun hah.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:07:10
also, if you don't think it'll reach $2300 and i should buy say now at $2580 would you let me know? seems like it's going up again 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:42:04
should i sell now or what? is it going overnight down you guys think? selling to buy more at cheaper price
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:55:32
Quadriga seemed the most user-friendly for me and it's good for canadians for funding options. Never tried bitfinex or bittrex. Quadriga does seem a little strange. Yes, my account is 8 months old, but I'm still new to commenting/posting..
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:41:11
Well then... Haha, maybe i'll transfer my coins over to bitfinex. I'm also registered on kraken. do you do daily trading? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:38:59
''If you hold your private keys on August 1st there will be a fork and you will have BitcoinCash (BCC) in addition to your BTC. If you sell before then, you have neither. Something to consider.''
Someone said that on /bitcoinmarkets  ...
So should i just buy BTC before august 1st and take em off the exchange and into my own wallet so i get BCC? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:32:27
my bad, meant USD. I thought it was a pump and dump but maybe not. Couldn't believe the price rocketed so quick yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:15:31
Yep, I'm new to this game. Alright, I'll give it a few days. Signed up on bitfinex. Looks way too confusing for me. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:27:53
yeah, they have a subreddit, some people have had problems. Might have to check out bittrex and bitfinex. I guess if i'm only keeping btc, then i won't have to withdraw fiat. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:24:30
got a date in mind?
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:57:47
woo! it's going down! so you predict it goes down to 2300$ US? i should set a buy order at that price? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:32:21
the price is only going up. think i'm gonna have to cut my losses.
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:28:33
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:42:57
Ok just making sure. Yeah, but I don't know how to do any kind of analysis though. But, i'll keep that in mind. no looking at hourly trends, look at bigger picture, got it
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:06:05
is there a fork happening on aug 1st? what exactly is gonna happen? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:16:46
yeah perhaps, I'm not sure how big the daily trade volume is at quadriga, but I can't imagine it competes with the big exchanges like kraken or coinbase, etc. Also it's weird, buy/sell order prices hover around the same price ''tags''.. Like they'll go up in value to 3550, then down to 3500, then back up to 3550, etc. It's weird how the prices are set I guess? And yes you can do direct transfers to your bank account. 
 
take a look, how do they compare in fees/options, etc.. ? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 01:05:23
Ok. Also, what's the difference between r/bitcoin and r/btc? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:03:29
seems like theres resistance at $2500
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:07:37
3628$ CDN. Maybe if it keeps going up for a bit I can buy now and sell once it's at a high? Or should I just wait it out for when a dip happens. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:51:51
I guess it's not worth it then? WTF is happening to btc right now
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:06:24
the price is still floating around 2700$ CAN. you think a dip is coming still? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:27:16
sold all my 1.37 btc. Sold for CDN$, on quadrigaCX. Originally bought 1.32 btc about 4 years ago. Put it on an exchange a few days ago, made some trades, got 1.47 btc, then a few more trades, down to 1.37, now all sold 15 mins ago. 
Also, seems like I have a 5 min wait time before posting again? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:16:42
K. Also if i buy BTC before aug 1st, should I take them off the exchange right away? Still waiting for that dip to buy in
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:34:52
I see. ... Still waiting for that drop!! hahah
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:35:59
Good advice. I think I'm more of a casual day-trader with bitcoin. Basically, buy low, sell high over the span of a few days. Bitcoin is super volatile but it always seems to retain a decent value. Also, I only just started with day-trading BTC recently because of the incoming hard fork, which I presume might cause a decent crash, which means I could buy way more btc. 
By the way, I've actually looked into FOREX trading, which is serious day-trading. I'd never get into crypto trading like that. But, I've read some stuff on FOREX trading. Risk management, candle chart readings, etc. Most day-traders fail, I'm aware of that. 
Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:13:32
price is really climbing holy shit
