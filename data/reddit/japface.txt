@_date: 2016-08-31 18:08:35
you're making an awful lot of assumptions there. the fact is technology doesn't stagnate very long and we're just at the beginning of bitcoin. I wouldn't expect to see a slow down of hardware in the long run for a while. and even if hardware doesn't increase at as fast a rate, the power efficiency likely will, which means server farms can upscale by just adding more asic miners. im not against everyone having a node, i think thats great. but i wouldn't expect any meaningful amount of btc to ever come out of a cheap consumer device. 5 bucks is even a lot to expect imo.
Edit: just to illustrate my point, 21 co's current bitcoin miner mines at a hashrate of up to 50 ghs. At that rate you're likely to accumulate 0.003 btc per month at today's difficulty. that means 1.71 usd, which means a net loss just to run the device due to power consumption and cost of hardware. cheaper hardware does even less and essentially will result in effectively 0 btc with random blips here and there of tiny fractions of a btc.
@_date: 2016-08-31 09:34:32
the problem with that is the more people use it, the less effective that hardware becomes at producing bitcoin due to difficulty increases. that being said its hard to imagine any low cost hardware like that being able to produce any significant bitcoin that would even be worth a piddling micro-transaction for any site or service. server farms right now just outclass cheap hardware now by many, many orders of magnitude that a device like that is more or less useless for producing bitcoin of any use right now because of the difficulty level that the cutting edge server farms are pushing constantly. they'd be good for maybe keeping another full node on the network though.

This isn't about enhancing the resolution of a zoomed up low res image. It's actually a process known as deconvolution. It's not perfect and won't really restore your image since blurring is lossy, but since we aren't talking about photo restoration and instead the extraction if information, my guess is that it can be done with the above photo well enough for that purpose.

pro-tip: next time you hold a microphone keep it about 2-3 inches away from your mouth, and pointed towards your mouth not towards the ceiling. unlike an omnidirectional condenser that might be used in a studio environment, a hand held dynamic microphone (like the shure beta 58 that it looks like you're holding) is much less sensitive, and requires much closer proximity to pick up sound. by keeping it closer, the sound guy wont have to turn up the volume as much which means less perceived room noise to compete with your voice in the final recording.

That should really be posted somewhere where everyone can easily see. Most people probably have zero idea you've proposed this or how all that other work relates to the block size debate. Maybe make a medium post and then post it to reddit. Seems like the popular thing to do these days.
Also don't let these people get to you. Most people are just hopping on a bandwagon without much deep understanding. That said core might consider getting someone to explain these things out in the open so that there is less opportunity to have this level of political bs in the community.

It seems like sw adoption has crawled to a halt. I'm guessing miners have a lot to do with that. What's the incentive for them to upgrade? 
I'm also wondering if there's any serious efforts being done to decentralize mining. It seems like an important choke point for controlling the state of bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-01-22 23:08:38
I realize there are long term incentives but the miners seem to be guided by short term profits due to the cost of mining and upgrading poses a threat to their bottom line at least initially since people can start grouping transactions on the lightning network, reducing the number of times a fee has to be paid. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 17:27:56

I know this probably runs against open bazaars core ideas but is there any chance we will see integration options with third party fulfilment services like fulfillment by amazon or printful (which do on demand prints for companies and artists).

so is this something thats supposed to compete with bitcoin or more along the lines of competing with ethereum?
@_date: 2016-09-24 23:19:25
I'm far from an expert. I'm not even a physicist or a scientist, but I'll give you my best explanation. Classical computers that we all use calculate and store data using binary bits, 1 and 0. Classical computers also typically have a tough time doing multiple operations at the same time. This is where threads come into play. When you see manufacturers talk about threads or cores, they're talking about how many simultaneous operations you can work on at the same time. The problem here is that its very costly to continue adding threads. 
Quantum computers on the other hand use quantum bits, aka qubits. while qubits can be 1 or 0, the advantage they have is that they can be in a superposition of either at the same time. that means a fuzzy 1 and 0, rather than only 1, or only 0. when you have 2 bits, you get 4 superpositions, 3 bits, and you get 8. so its 2^n where n = bits. So that gives you exponential power to compute. How this works is a bit weird though. When you give your computer a problem, it does this quantum funny business of throwing these bits into superposition. but when you want your answer and observe these bits, the quantum state collapses into the answer you were seeking, but only probably. So chances are you need to run that calculations a few times to make sure that you got the right answer. I think this is much like electron shells on an atom. You can't know 100% where an electron is, but you can say theres an 18% chance this electron will be at this energy state, or 50% that it will be in another (i think its more complicated since i'm not really factoring in the heisenberg uncertainty principle).
This is much like the idea of a photon travelling all possible paths to a chloroplast in a plant, and then "choosing" the most efficient path to it when collapsing its quantum state. as far as I understand, this is probably the reason why photosynthesis is so efficient in plant life.
@_date: 2016-09-24 21:18:11
Quantum computers get around that problem. Unlike conventional computers they are really good at factoring because they're able to compute all possibilities at the same time. There are quantum proof encryption methods from what I understand but bitcoin is presently not protected from attacks by quantum computers. 
@_date: 2016-09-05 18:44:56

I agree with you, I just happen to not use my data plan often lol. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 23:06:34
Well, the biggest issue bitcoin would face would be the fact that a quantum computer can find a private key just by seeing the public key. obviously a huge problem if this happens since it means your coins can be confiscated.
If hashing is also broken because of quantum computers we'll also have a big problem because its unlikely quantum computers will be household items any time soon, which means likely governments have a monopoly on that tech, and thus can control what transactions get written. sure, difficulty would spike up, but that spike upward would mean only quantum computers could feasibly mine, and asics would be completely useless.
@_date: 2016-09-25 03:33:32
As far as I understand it's tricky but doable with a quantum computer. That alone is probably enough to make people a little nervous I would think. But again I'm no expert.

well lightning network solves a lot of microtransaction issues, plus allowing refunds and what not, and it allows the network to do the kind of offchain transactions that a company like coinbase has to take completely off chain right now. lightning network isn't really as offchain as it sounds since any transactions that occur that don't fully connect immediately get dumped onto the regular blockchain. the broadcasts also only happen at the end of the period. so you could have had many transactions occur, but only the final balance of the collection of transactions is broadcast, which significantly reduces bloat.
also theres nothing forcing anyone to use the LN, you can still use bitcoin as is. its just the option is nice thats all. also sidechains allow us to develop other ideas using hte power of bitcoin without having to completely separate ourselves from it (ie building an independent blockchain).
@_date: 2015-09-11 02:26:33
I know a lot of people here shit on lightning network, but i really hope sidechains and LN are up and running soon before big business comes in and imposes their will on the network to a point where change, experimentation, and decentralized transactions become a thing of the past.

Bitcoin at present is not anonymous but there is work going into making it more anonymous (like reusable payment codes). Right now it's pseudonymous, so if you dig deep enough and trace funds for long enough you can potentially identify users. In reality paper money is the most anonymous as there aren't digital records for transactions. It's why it's the preferred standard for crime right now.

Yeah I have to say I dont understand this whole thing. Outside of him just trying to get attention, if he really were satoshi it's unlikely he'd want to be known as such, and would simply say no I'm not him and let the rumour die. If it was him, then why all the fuss? just prove it with the cryptography. Right now this guy is just dragging it out for no reason, either prove it or gtfo. furthermore, if he were satoshi, why would this be so important to him? if he's so heart broken about proving he's satoshi, why would he even bother. even if he were partially found out, isn't it better to leave it an unconfirmed rumour? so much of this is suspicious.

i think the difference is that bitcoin's transactions are publicly viewable and traceable by anyone. and the fact that people usually default to using the same addresses over and over makes it pretty easy to figure out whos buying what, and where the coins have gone, and whether or not those coins are "tainted" by black market purchases. cash is a lot harder unless you're willing to mark those bills. with cash you might be able to figure out faces if you're in the vicinity, but you might not have undeniable proof that you would with a digital ledger like bitcoin. a criminal might for instance use a surrogate to conduct transactions, which separates them enough from potentially being identified directly. a btc transaction can't do that yet. even with separation you can trace those coins to their eventual resting place in the criminal's account. even tumblers right now aren't fool proof. 
all that being said, its not like work isnt being done to improve it, but if it were more anonymous, i think we'd see far more use in the criminal world than we do now. fact is, cash is better for the time being.

eh, i dont think anyone is really interested in open bazaar until 2 things happen:
* IPFS so that you dont need to run it all the time
* good anonymity, so that you can sell shady shit.
Bitcoin itself needs a lot more features before it can be used for that, and before it becomes interesting for real world use cases. Things like reusable payment codes, lightning network, zero knowledge payments, more widespread adoption of coinjoin/join market. without these things you cant really use bitcoin readily with confidence that you can buy anything and not get called out for it at some point down the line. 
Anyway, every project I see right now I consider extremely early work. Bitcoin itself is nowhere near prime time from a technological standpoint, its hard to expect others to want to even own it if the fundamentals are still only good for holding and not for using on a large scale. I think of bitcoin as something that might be ready in 5 years time and start seeing real world adoption in 10+ years, not today.
