Is it 12 words?

Ok, so my script kiddy script is doing something wrong :-)  
Was a great task for this evening. Thanks for enriching it and getting me familiar with Python prawn. The hardest part would be to check seeds automatically for balance - didn't get so far since I found a lot of words - but funnily no occurrence of 12 bip39 words directly one after another in my 1964 possibilities of &gt;=12 bip39 words from your 849 comments.

Just trying to debug now versus the known from u/dooglus

Reviewing his work, posting the seed in italics, there are multiple other bip39 words in between. There is practically no chance to find it programmatically due to all the possibilities. My script found his post, the words and extracted the string correctly 


But as you see, no chance without serious computational power and added auto check for balance which is the real crux, also programmatically slowing down the loop.

I understood it in general in before. But I didn't understand your wording, having them split across the text. And yes, I really do think this method is pretty safe - for now.   
  
Let's see, when NP hard problems are getting solved like Traveling Salesman, this method will lose, too.
Thank you and good night :-)

Give some more tipps regarding your posted BTC in plain sight. Is it BIP39, directly followed words?
