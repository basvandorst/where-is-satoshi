You probably haven’t transfered BTC between exchanges...
And just learned what FUD means? Congrats...

1. Because I have sent and recieved several transactions to and from Bittrex and other exchanges in the kast couple of days, with no isue whatsoever.
2. It already appears on coinbase as pending.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:48:17
Yes! And add more in time as you save more money, diversify when you have a little more!
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:28:00
Exactly same thing happening to me with coinbase at the moment (same company).
It’s ridicoulous
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:29:06
I just don’t get it they are making more than enough money to hire customer service reps and the do nothing about it!
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:11:43
It’s ridicoulous! 
What happened to you?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:44:35
I hadn’t checked that honestly but almost 41 hours without restablishing normal performance is ridiculous!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:25:55
Estimations say around 50m people worldwide so early adopters fot sure

1. Open an account on another exchange which offers bcash trading ( I recommend Bittrex) 
2. Send that BTC to Bittrex (be carefull) send bitcoin to bitcoin wallet so your funds dont get lost
3. Go to BTC/BCH and do the exchange
4. You can send from bittrex to the vendors wallet (watch out for scams)
Good luck

Highly recommend!!!

So you think it’s not ridicoulous to have been waiting for so long? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:24:09
Update!! 60 hours now still nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:31:15
I know what you mean! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:54:17
The offer a service for which they charge high fees for. 
It’s their responsibility to provide it, not mine!
If they cannot handle the volume then do not accept more people or hire more people.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:25:51
It’s ridicoulous! Good luck man you’ll need it with this shitty company!
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:31:27
There are no fiat options on Bittrex that I am aware of! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:30:11
I understand but I have made several transactions from other exchanges (Binance-Bittrex-Gemini-Polo-Liqui) in the past 3 days and haven’t had a single problem!
Don’t you think this has something to do with Coinbase?
Its not the network
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:53:17
I RECEIVED BTC INTO MY COINBASE ACCOUNT 9 DAYS AGO!!! 1400 CONFIRMATIONS AND STILL SHOWS PENDING!!! CALLED, EMAILED HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND NO HELP!!! ANY SUGGESTIONS?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:09:37
I believe it is 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:44:11
You will get the equivalent in Bitcoin gold, that doesn’t mean that you have double, since the price of Bitcon gold is gonna be a lot lower than the one of BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-24 04:15:12
Youre totally right, sorry about that.
The exchange you keep it at probably made a statement about it. In this case it seems Coinbase isn’t gonna distribute BTG
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:53:09
I believe it is the same case.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:01:39
100%, the hype is just starting.
A lot of people are entering the markets right now looking for the huge gains we have seen this year.
But this is still in the early stages!
