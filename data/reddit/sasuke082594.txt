@_date: 2019-07-23 17:05:55
Nah, got in at 4, sold at 19 back in dec 2017. Don’t be a fool and buy high sell low.
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:43:13
I’ll upvote this one.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:38:57
It’s happening get over it noob, if you’re not informed, that’s on you. Plus I got in, recycled, rinse, repeat.

For some odd reason you can say things like this in this sub, almost as if people don’t like knowing the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:30:51
Oh ok makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:27:24
Switch to litecoin. Stop stressing.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:25:21
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:35:36
Unfortunately fiat is very undervalued due to government regulation. Fortunately we can covert currency and move to something that adjusts accordingly 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:06:30
Will do. 50% daily compound interest on the coins + original purchase starting the moment you get the coins.

Fuck the government. This is why I’m not reporting my gains on crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:23:49
You should have put a higher fee. Hopefully miners can mine your transaction within the end of next year. . As for what you can do on your side, switch to LTC. Your problems will go away.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:42:41
So you’re saying you have over 250k in credit allowance? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:05:03
In other words you gave money to these organizations that don’t even use said money for the correct cause. Good for you.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:23:37
You should have mentioned litecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:11

Already dying down. Got blocked on litecoin sub for calling out Charlie Lee selling his coins. So screw it pump and dump LTC it is for me. Bought at 59$ and sold at 67$. Can’t wait for it to hit &gt;60$ again. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:57:59
Lol hold on
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:58
Move to LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:54:31
Yes it will
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:26:01
In other words, do what people should have done since the inception of bitcoin.

Send me the money I’ll buy it for you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:55
Yeah, no. I sold all my BTC back in August before the fork was even under way. LTC all the way baby!
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:41:04
Lmfao 
@_date: 2018-08-21 00:49:23

Upvote. Hope you get these coins when they’re worth 600k each and the economy collapses again.

The IRS will come by next year after you failed to pay the taxes on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:26:47
Might as well get it now.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:43:46
It says it up there. If you don’t care about the fork then move to hardware wallet or app wallet
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:15:49
Good luck paying .5 BTC in the future just for fees alone.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:04:02
You’re not going to make anything out of 10$. Put those in along with more fiat when it dips
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:31:05
Good hopefully all the posts are directed to there.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:38:01
In other words, ETH is he future “credit”
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:45:34
Sell altcoins and then come back with the results?l after the fork? I’m keeping my LTC.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:34:14
They will eventually, stealing your free S2X in the process.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:18:56
Stay with bitcoin or convert to LTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:33:17
Lol what the fuck?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:10:11
Definitely pump and dump. Decided to cash out and buy litecoin instead.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:25:21
You should have bought 3 weeks ago. Missed the train.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:51:32
I looked it up thanks
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:28:39
I already knew hat but someone pointed out that in the exchange we don’t own the keys and therefore they might potentially not give us the B2X and trade it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:54:46
How will people learn? I say let them all sell so the price can plummet and I can buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:03:11
I’ve been with chase for a few years now and it’s my most used bank out of ally and chime.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:31:14
Two things can happen:
1.	Bitcoin continues to go up after the fork and people lose out.
2.	Bitcoin drops after the fork because everyone is moving to LTC and ETH

40 s5 smartphones at around 80$ each in my area. The consumption ratio to hash power is more desirable than a full fledged desktop. You’d need about 308 s5 and the software they will release might not even be limited to just an s5.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:30:13
I sold at 6500... panic sold...
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:03:56
They probably did if they bought under 5500.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:03:43
How do you know?!
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:05:18
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:17:46
So long as the transactions don’t add up to 0btc
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:23:28
No fiat whatsoever? Even the smallest amount is a start.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:21:00
Because high fees, slow transactions. LTC is the beefed up BTC and eventually will surpass BTC in value.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:15:32
They want everyone to cash out their B2X unknowingly without replay protection. If anything I wouldn’t sell shit until you split your coins. Split your coins then sell B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:47:22
I’m sorry but the irs isn’t going to know where I got my profit from. Especially if I withdraw from an atm.

Also [RIP n00bs who bought B2X](
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:28:37
Because it is.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:37:03
If you have 5 BTC you will have 5 S2X. That’s it. What the amount of S2X seems to be is what they’ll be worth.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:24:29
It’s going back down to around 4500$ after the fork. It’s being stimulated by investors.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:26:25
No 15. I smashed when I was 14.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:28:45
It’s pretty much the perfect app and tracks every crypto you can think of. Also has landscape mode on plus models. You can also input how much of each crypto you own into a portfolio and track its rise or fall. It has light and dark mode and offers custom icon option. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:45:11
1.	The amount of BTC will still be there but 24hrs before the fork and/or after the fork the price will either go up or down but we won’t be able to trade between this timeframe. 
2.	It will be BTC
3.	You can keep both and I recommend keeping both. The chances are that BTC and S2X will dip tremendously after the fork(BTC might dip before the fork). That’s another chance to buy low and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:21:06
Sold. I’ll buy back when it goes down sub 5500 like when I bought.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:40:39
I suggest everyone move their BTC to a hardwallet before the fork. S2X is an attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:43:21
I’m speculating that probably 25% of the Coinbase buyers we have will sell right before the fork and then we will see posts saying “where is my free S2X/B2X/free money?” For the days to come after that.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:11
I didn’t really care about bitcoin. All my HODLing is in Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:47:50
If this happens people will dip real quick and go to a different coin. A more secure coin. Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:44:58
It’s going back down. I’ll be back. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:43:52
It’s a giant bubble ready to burst. One of the cons of being the top crypto.

@_date: 2017-11-13 03:14:11
Let me boot up my laptop and start mining.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:15:28
The last dip was 3 weeks ago. Should have bought then.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:11:14
The real question is can we as the users implement or “turn on” replay protection for S2X?
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:29:41
A way of life.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:20:35
Not sure. I’ve been hearing mixed things about this. Technically you should be correct
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:55:43
Not to the educated bitcoin buyers. Everyone here on this sub is talking about all the irrelevant things but no one cares to make one post saying what will happen if you sell BTC or B2X prior to splitting the coins 100%
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:16:51
LTC is pure. Why even bring up LTC. The community doesn’t want that kind of politics.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:57:02

Miners stopped mining. Game over. Move to LTC. It’s superior in every way.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:42:08
I read something just now about Coinbase and the B2X. I’ll be moving to a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:23:03
Don’t trust him. If it was ledger or trezor then yes check it out. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:42:29
Not that great of a read. Seems like he’s typing to convince himself plus I’ve never heard of the guy or the website. Just stop. If it’s not on Coinbase then it’s not in the big 3.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:25:41
It’s over. Better pull out now while you can
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:19:25
I wish I would have known about all of this back in January. I would have easily dropped money for 250 litecoins.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:29:33
LTC is in Coinbase not BCH, try again.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:30:44
No it would have been obvious. Everyone who knows about crypto knows that BCH is a shitcoin. LTC is a well established crypto currency 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:33:53
Well, fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:45:45
Mmm no. I’ll buy back when it corrects itself at sub 5k
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:22:54
What dip? It’s staying strong at 7.9k
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:05:41
I know
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:19:45
In other words:
People pay less fees in exchange for mining to be less profitable and more centralized(ex would be any bank)
People stop being cheap and realize nothing good comes free. 
I’d rather pay higher fees and be decentralized 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:30:28
Dude you’re funny lol

Roger Ver is wrecking all the noobs over at BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:34:09
Yeah but it might not be worth to sell it. Everyone is going to flock to sell off the S2X and BTC so you’re better off keeping both. If anything invest in ETH and LTC from now on until the fork.

@_date: 2017-11-06 12:28:57
You’re a dumbass. None of this even makes sense. To say that someone is a dumbass for trying to make a quick buck is absurd. It’s called learning. Not being dumb. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:51:58
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:17:19
Yeah because transaction is there no matter what.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:24:50
The train left already. BTC is stagnant and everyone is moving to LTC. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:25:22
What I mean by “drops” is it goes back to around 4000-4500.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:14:23
It is what it is
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:27:06
Should have HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:51:19

Sell half and keep it inside Coinbase USD. Withdrawal 1000$ a week into a prepaid card. Taxes evaded. Or you can find a close ATM and cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:26:33
Which is why I haven’t invested a single penny into it. Litecoin and bitcoin for muah.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:35:12
[People tried to make a small profit lmfao](
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:05:03
I’m sure you bought that 0.4 BTC for like 60$ so whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:11:58
Quality shitpost.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:27:40
Oh that sucks then. I had to sell at a giant loss about a month ago myself and just bought some again. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:27:03
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:41:48
You dumbass. There was never going to be free coins. I cashed out a week ago. Put it into LTC instead.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:00:10
When you can’t do simple math
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:44:09
Damn I wonder at what price they bought at.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:48:42
I have a bit in savings but I didn’t want to touch it. The loss in bitcoin wasn’t a big deal. The purchase was just merely playing around and see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:31:46
Hopefully 4k
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:22:58
People will sell and most likely buy into litecoin. I put serious money into litecoin because it’s most likely going to skyrocket after the fork. Better to buy now at $55$ than at ~$100. I also put some into bitcoin because free B2X and will probably sell before it reaches under $6000(that’s when I bought some bitcoin) so I won’t be under.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:31:39
Lol okay, throwaway. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:35:06
Not efficient enough. It mines faster than diamond but will break faster also.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:28:52
People are going to sell and move to altcoins. Buy litecoin while it’s at the discount price.

@_date: 2017-11-01 16:27:42
Yeah I know I fucked up but I’m in a better place now. And investing even more little by little. I have a 401k with my company that matches 6% but it’s Davis bacon. I have plenty of investments else where such as ally savings but I didn’t want to touch that at the time and bitcoin was an experiment at the time(I only lost like 20$) so I decided to just pull it out.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:32:19
I usually throw around 100$ when I see it dipping for a good few hours straight.

@_date: 2017-11-06 16:31:35
Lol ok. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:44:51
Already have altcoins bought. When people sell bitcoin and move to altcoin I’ll sell some off and by then maybe bitcoin will dip a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:28:03
Go ahead and sell your B2X right away then and see what happens to your BTC. Vice versa.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:38:05
I will invest in all three but have yet to try ETH. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:07:54
 • LTC has a longer proven history.
 • LTC has more hash security
 • LTC has equivalent blockcapacity as BitcoinCash
 • LTC has segwit and LN capabilities.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:52:48
Porsche are overrated. Going for that Ford GT babay! But I realize I made the worst investment back in January. I put $1000 down on a new 2017 car. Had I put that in LTC(didn’t know about crypto at all until late August) I could have bought 250 LTC at $4 and sold at around 80$ back in September. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:25:30

@_date: 2017-11-26 19:17:36
Have an upvote.

This is exactly what I hoped would happen to all the dumbasses that put money into BCH.
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:13:15
I thought cloud mining was a scam
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:41:04
Cashed out at 18k last year. Have not bought in, should I keep waiting ?
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:34:03
Who cares buy the dip
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:56:31
Of course you did
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:50:31
Pay the fees and stop being cheap.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:29:03
Just saw the extra long “TL;DR”
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:18:20
Lol no
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:19:05
Rip

Tax is a criminal act invoked by democrats. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:41:22
I have about 5k to burn right now. Should I buy some bitcoin? Nah.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:00:46
Any wallet you guys recommend for mobile users?
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:52:18
I need to buy at least 1 asap. Barely getting to know bitcoin. I bought a bunch of litecoin though so hopefully something happens with that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:26:17
Let the FUD commence.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:52:36
So in other words, wait until the market cap is reached.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:30:14
I don’t have bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:23:29
Look at a chart from its inception til now. Almost every kind of crypto currency goes up in value. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:43:14
Lol I know you’re joking. I’m sure it will go back up to atleast where I break even
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:10:44
Dude that’s crazy. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:17:34
Atleast you got your card I ordered mine on the 3rd and have yet to receive it. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:07:10
Between 7&amp;8 you’re forgetting 7.5:
Sees BTC dropping, sells at a loss.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:46:50
Smh lol 
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:22:27
I get it. I just didn’t want to jump into this without asking. I just thought there was a faster way than having 12 kH/s power from my laptop.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:34:00
Don’t go with bitpay. Bought my card on the 3rd of September. Have yet to receive it and they have yet to respond to my ticket.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:48:57
50$ won’t amount to anything unless the price of 1 BTC goes from 4K to 40k
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:58:30
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:09:17
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:37:47
Yeah my 3 litecoin aren’t breaking the bank
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:36:21
Live well at their expense. They should have invested while the investment was there.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:22:12
Wtf lol where is your TL;DR? Too much BS to read.
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:39:42
At this rate I’ll have to buy a few. It went up to 95$ and I purchased that same week for about 76$
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:55:17
Well then lol
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:40:33
Shoot I’m buying in again before it hits 300+ again this Christmas again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:38:22
I have 6 and none are maxed. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:36:26
You were better off buying litecoin while it’s so cheap and there’s a lot in circulation. Eventually it’s going to skyrocket like Bitcoin did.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:41:49
I need to close 3 if they won’t accept my request for annual fees.
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:27:24
Just hold
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:02:23
I decided to wait to buy. It’s going to drop more given the Coinbase charts. I did buy Litecoin at 76$ and it peaked at 95$ this past Friday but decided to wait and now it’s at 66$ I believe. I’ll be buying more.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:10:29
I have 4LTC on there, should I move it to a secured wallet? ��
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:07:24
What do you mean by died?
Edit: auto correct turned “died” into “ford” when I typed it smh
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:13:37
So every time it drops a few hundred(even though it’s inflated to over 4K) it’s dead?
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:40:08
Here in California, we pay for electricity.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:58:55
It dropped a few thousand. I know because I regret buying at the time
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:48:32
Assuming they bought over 250 bitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:37:47
Yeah my 3 litecoin aren’t breaking the bank
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:06:33
Yeah unfortunately they have yet to respond to me and when I tried get a hold of a representative I was on hold for 30 mins before I gave up
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:08:30
That’s like half the coins I have lol 
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:40:04
What’s nice hash 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:18:20
Lol no
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:21:28
Right lol I just wanted to understand how badly I fucked up at not buying every time it’s going down in  value lol but Coinbase fees sure kill the excitement 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:04:04
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:24:03
I thought so. I tried applying for one but I already have a BitPay debit card.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:45:23
You crazy mofo. Hopefully you got some cash back.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:30:59
5k give or take. Might as well sell now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:41:11
Now I understand what it means by “fork”
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:39:59
Fees are good? Idk about that, Coinbase fees are pretty absurd.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:55:27
Rebuy at a higher price?
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:29:59
Who’s the idiot that wrote this article lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:38:00
The rate is not controllable. Only the amount of BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:44:22
Now you’re out of .0008 that could have easily turned int .00008 had you kept it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:31:48
I have both Ł and B. Should I sell off my Ł at a 30$ loss(half of the loss is due to fees) and move to B or keep them there?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:39:18
I invested more than around 210$ total on 3 litecoin sand now it’s all worth 147$. Is it going to do down more?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:41:22
Lol it’s cool
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:27:39
Clickbait title
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:51:41
Cloud mining contract for 16BTC?! ����‍♂️����‍♂️����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:07:40
Nice. 
Edit: just checked. I’m good.
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:32:01
So what is he saying exactly 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:54:33
How does that work? I thought this fork only affected bitcoin? My intention was to get “free” bitcoin from S2X. Then when people sell and go to alt coin the value goes up and I make as much profit from Ł
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:55:08
I moved my alert to 6200. It’s likely t will shoot up there for just a min
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:40:11
I hope it drops to 1000$ per coin hehehe
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:36:21
Close your accounts or keep your money in a safe. The less money that’s in circulation from the banks the better.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:49:58
One thing is for sure, those who bought at $7 are set.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:08:46
I’m an American and I got verified as soon as I entered my ID and I guess it helps that’s my Bank account is more than 3 years old.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:14:14
It will go down quite a bit after the fork because people will sell off.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:47:45
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:51:04
Buy in increments that you are ok with when you see that the chart is red. If you see it’s going up every few mins double that increment. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:06:12
Thanks for the input guys. I guess I’ll just keep using bitcoin miner on my laptop. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:41:18
Longest pof?
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:35:57
I only have a minuscule amount of bitcoin and moving it at this time isn’t worth it
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:08:14
Fuck. Ain’t that some shit?
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:23:42
Fuck lol
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:35:00
Lol got fucked over by a pizza 
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:54:12
Yeah, I should’ve atleast used half on LtC.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:16:19
I look back to when LtC was 4$ in 2017 and I could have bought 2k worth of it. I put that money to a down payment on a new car instead.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:45:57
Just adding that you both are correct and there is absolutely nothing left to add.
