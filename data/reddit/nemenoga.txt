Yeah, adding to the criticism, I'd expect such a video to include decent shot mimicking the classical bull run meme: Uphill (of course) with exact angle, shaking (!) + velocity streaks.

Why does it say that bitcoins are required to buy bitcoins?

"But people do get struck by lightning!", they argue.

Shouldn't you contact the previous owner, if there is any data on the disk indicating who he was?
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:47:39
I preemptively answered that concern below. ;-)
But in principle I agree.

Oh, they could destroy it in many other and more economically feasible ways, than building a quantum computer.
E.g. by spreading FUD on social media and provoking forks. ;)

Wouldn't that just mean faster and more efficient mining? I'd be more worried about if the secret keys can be found from the public key (and AFAIK that is not SHA-256).
Please put me right on this.. :)

Did M3 include assets such as housing? I mean, couldn't one have seen the sub-prime housing crisis coming by looking at M3? Just wondering. ��

Fun fact: Inflation won't help all that much for those with variable interest mortgages.

Ah, then it's not so bad at all. You may find comfort in that at least it did some good.
Better one bird in the hand, than ten on the roof (Danish proverb ;-)

My impression is, you should rather worry about errors/flaws/weaknesses/backdoors than a n00b with a functioning quantum computer will steal your Coins.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:36:30
May other things would break when that happens.. if I remember correctly they rely on ECDSA here.
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:26:18
And that is what many other bitcoin anecdotes forget. You have to be smart twice: not only buying at the right time, but also *selling* at the right time.
Had I my hands on 1k btc in 2010 wouldn't I have sold the lot of them when they surged to 10$? Probably yes.

Tell them you spent most of it, and what you have left is nothing worth / has little value.
No reason to attract attention, security is also keeping low profile.

Ask him, what gives that piece of paper value which says "100$".
Or how can he be sure that the pixels on the screen which quotes his current savings is real?
In the end, it is about trust.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:01:34
He has a point there, a currency requires that there is a crowd of people trusting it represents some value. ;-)

No internet, no bitcoin.

A log plot would be more interesting.
(Log Y-axis ofc.)

It needs additional actuators, so it shakes and vibrates if it increases/decreases more than 10% per day.

Shouldn't that be "hodl"?

Hope CDs are still readable. The tend to suffer from data rot.
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:46:09
That depends strongly on how you store them, and the quality of the discs.
If you keep them warm and humid, or (even worse) in sunlight, they will go bad much quicker.
I lost some CD-Rs after three years of storage in a drawer.
