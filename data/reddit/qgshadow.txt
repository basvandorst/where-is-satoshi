What pyramid scheme

Einstein exchange . Quadriga doesn’t support wire and it takes days I get money through EFT. With Einstein, you do a wire and have your money in a day usually and they convert to USD at current rates.

Should tell your friend to look into Einstein Exchange and wire money and they can get BTC in 1-2 days for 5K plus without any issues. The only fees you pay is for your wire transfer. They convert your CAD to USD using XE.com rates

Feels like bitcoin is going to 10k again. Before i had 50% portfolio btc now only 30% sold and bought altcoins with much better returns that the coins actually serves a purpose. I hope btc stays strong but it's on the downhill now.

Yes 10% for credit cards. Quadriga doesn’t support credit cards so why do you compare both for credit cards. I agree 10% for fees but who funds big amounts with credit cards lol, nobody.

Use Einstein exchange, Quadriga too slow to fund.

No they don't. Wire transfers are free. And they also convert your CAD to USD for free using spot rates. And they also trade in USD with real market prices not inflated CAD prices on quadrigax. And you get your fund faster using Wire transfers than Quadriga with EFT. 10% is for credit cards and Quadriga doesnt support Credit Card anyways.

When you open your wallet and select "I don't know" instead of Legacy or Segwit what does it show. I had the same issue that my bitcoin dissapeared from legacy and wasnt on segwit yet but when i clicked on I don't know it showed the total to that address. After a little bit everything was on segwit in the app.
