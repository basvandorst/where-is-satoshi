They love it. The other day I overheard my kids talking to each other about bitcoin. It was like music to my ears. I wish that I had recorded the conversion, but that moment passed so quickly. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:52:18
The headline grabs attention. The story is about a girl lost in a supermarket. 
Your child will be introduced to cutting-edge technological marvels such as cryptocurrency, augmented reality, and a touch of artificial intelligence, while learning the most important lesson of all:
Important values such as empathy, thoughtfulness, and creativity will continue to guide us through an ever changing world.

Thanks! There are lots of people with strong opinions about the topic - both haters and supporters.  :)

Once upon a time some guy threw away his computer hard drive holding worthless digital currencies. After the price went up, he searched long and hard in the landfill, but eventually failed to find it.
Years later, a seven-year-old girl broke her augmented reality glasses, and went to a repair shop near the landfill. They replaced her screen and hard drive.
This is when the story begins! :)

Thanks! The illustrator is amazing. I worked with 8 artists until I found the perfect one for the book.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:01:30
I’ll check it out.  Thanks for your advice.
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:57:11
You’ll see at the end of the story. :)
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:00:41
That’s a good question. I wish I found 99 BTC though.
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:48:36
Thanks!  That made my day. The eBook will available in June.  It’s on Kickstarter now:

Thanks! She can be at times, when she wants to

As for other tools, I searched for “A Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer”, but couldn’t find it on eBay, Ali Express, and Ludus.
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:17:44
LoL, she was plugged in as a baby. I feel a bit guilty as a parent, but plans on severely limiting screen time fell to the wayside as daily life w kids wears on. So now she has a good book to read. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:31:34
LoL!  Darn, should have drawn some clothes on the elephant... Knew I was missing something.  But the elephant is quite smart. He’s into privacy too.  See pic: [page in book]( 
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:14:37
You’re right.  They don’t.  I think they only care about Distributed Ledger Tech with their consensus algo’s, security, and scalability.
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:43:54
LoL.  You can be a writer.  That’s part of the book, though it’s another crypto. :) [Page from the book](

The Unreal engine is pretty amazing, huh?!  It’s 
written in C++ and is very portable. I think Fortnite or some versions of it use the 4th version of the engine.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:44:03
I’m learning real quick! :) Reddit has been awesome so far, as I try to take in both the good and the criticisms.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:13:39
Eyes are windows to the soul ;)
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:06:46
Haha!  That makes perfect sense
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:40:53
Thanks! Good points from all. Even if they are criticism, those are points well taken. I’m also having a little fun here. I would buy you a beer if we were in a bar.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:42:16
We are the story we tell ourselves. I see it as a fun book.
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:21:15
It teaches SAFU. ;) In all seriousness, I hope to spark children’s imagination, while instilling important values that will never change: kindness, creativity, and thoughtfulness.  A good summary is here:[Vinny Tales - 99 Bitcoins and an Elephant ](Vinnytales.com) 
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:06:51
Thanks, let me fix it [Vinny Tales Page]( 
@_date: 2018-10-06 11:41:10
It’s on Amazon now, but I have been looking into a site for BTC. It will take some time to set up as I try to find the best best way - Eg Shopify vs WooCommerce w plugins.
And thank you! It’s exciting to publish and look forward to setting up bitcoin acceptance.

@_date: 2018-10-07 04:00:40
You are wise. I am a bit idealistic on some things. Makes good writing but not for the wallet. I need to learn from you.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:50:48
*high five* I would buy you a beer.
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:14:41
Good idea! :)
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:28:49
You’re awesome. I see others’ points and respectfully disagree.  Thanks for chiming in with your view 
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:01:56
I see your point. I respectfully disagree though, because it’s her creation too. My kids chose the artist, and the theme song for Kickstarter, and pointed out details that adults would miss - especially at the start and end of the project. One day she would write her own book without me. So I use this project to enjoy our time together more while she’s still small.
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:54:28
As a fellow author, I would love to have your thoughts on the book when you have a chance. Thanks again.
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:14:18
The indicator flashed earlier this year. I held on and continue to believe.
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:22:07
Upvoted as this is a legit question. Last I heard is Fidelity and TD Ameritrade planning to allow their customers to trade. And many other great and not so great ways to obtain.
There are a lot of resources out there. Learn from the ones you trust most. Worth being healthy-skeptical.
@_date: 2018-10-06 11:03:14
The elephant is more like the Yoda in the story. The elephant lives in AR. The elephant likes Monero more though...lol.  See image:  [Elephant Page]( 
@_date: 2018-10-06 21:58:32
Wallok.  He is an artist in Colombia. I worked with 8 artists to start. My kids really like Wallok’s drawings so we were lucky that his schedule was open at the time to do the entire project.
@_date: 2018-10-06 11:28:22
She is 4 years old, so she says she loves bitcoins. She “loves 99 bitcoins”.
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:09:51
Thanks, I’ll check it out
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:15:19
Your words are an inspiration.  Thanks!
And the cartoon idea is great. After that is action figures and LEGO video games. ��
@_date: 2018-10-07 03:58:51
It’s a story about the future, where AR is common. Bitcoin and AR play a role in the plot, but they are as common as burgers and fries. The elephant is in AR in the story, but it’s is really about a girl and her relationship with her mother.
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:42:27
My kids gave me bags... under my eyes. ;)
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:23:50
Yes. I want to sell the book. Because my fam and I had so much fun making it. And we pour our hearts and time into it.  More importantly, the kids that read read it love the story. 
But the books on the photo... they are already sold.
@_date: 2018-10-07 01:24:59
P0o0o0h - thank you. Wish some on Reddit see it this way, but even a small handful like you makes this worthwhile.
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:01:59
A joke.
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:25:59
She helped with the book
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:12:36
Cheers! It’s a way to show my kids that they can turn ideas into reality. And getting their comments is a lot of fun. 
We got went on Kickstarter and got fully funded.[Funded Kickstarter](

I hear you. It’s not for everyone.
And I try not rub people I don’t know. My wife would be jealous... or worse.

It’s not related, though I read that site.  I have a small Facebook page thing: [Vinny Tales Sci-fi Books]( 
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:52:36
It’s a page in the book.

Gags23 - thank you! You are the few, the proud, the awesome!
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:05:32
The story is a little sad. It’s because the girl lives with her mom and the mom works too much. So she is lonely. Bitcoin is in the plot, but it’s about a girl and her mom.
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:07:20
LoL!  Also this - if you having money problem, I feel bad for you son. ‘Cuz she found 99 bitcoins, so her problems are done.
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:08:40
Not a bad way to be introduced to an awesome technology ;)

Noel! I love Monero. The book never mentions it. But it’s there.[Book Image - XMR]( 
@_date: 2018-10-06 22:35:45
Happy to answer your questions. The art costs approximately $5k. That includes working with 8 artists and narrowing it down to one. All-in about $9k, though it could less on the next project. Let me know if you have any more questions. I can be reached at [Facebook Page]( 
@_date: 2018-10-06 22:16:26
The story is about 3 worlds - physical, virtual, and inner (emotional). The VR should really be AR, but there are no great AR headsets out yet.

I felt like the water is quickly rising above my head. And you just threw me lifesaver.
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:08:47
It’s true. :)  Bitcoin is at the core of the story, though the plot is about a little girl lost in a big supermarket.

Cheers!  Adoption is slow but it’s moving forward.  The story uses bitcoin to move the plot forward and raise the stakes.  It’s on Kickstarter with 6 more days to go. [Kickstarter](
