Calm down bro. I have Litecoins too, and I am not even knocking it as a cryptocurrency. It's just that this is and not the place to discuss other currencies.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:42:56


Lots of people, myself included, but you're missing the point. A currency existing and people having access to it does not give it value.


If Bitcoin sets the precedent necessary for this idea to have value, then people will go to Bitcoin instead. Nobody will collect Facecoin if everybody thinks it will go to $100 because everybody already has one. There's no incentive to buy it or sell it, either, because it has no worth of its own and no apparent way to use it for anything except trading a hollow currency.


When will this Facebook coin idea? A large available user base is meaningless, and the 10% number is arbitrary. There's no guarantee that even 0.001% will pick up on this.


People will rail against this rather than support it, or just turn their coin in right away giving the fake currency back to Facebook. Reddit gold serves two purposes: to support Reddit and give thanks for a particularly well-written comment. Facebook does not need the 1st (especially since the coin is their own, and has no value except for that which they've just defined) and the 2nd, while possibly usable, is not going to spur people to buy these things from other people.


So could my Monopoly money, but that doesn't mean it's even remotely likely to happen.

That's not a great thing for proponents of Bitcoin, that's a great thing for traders of Bitcoin. If you were really pushing for Bitcoin's adoption as a currency, obviously you'd want as many people to adopt it as possible
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:21:15


Monopoly money is currency made by someone else besides a government, but nobody goes around trading it. Just because the currency exists and has a large exposure doesn't mean anybody's going to adopt it. Most people on Facebook aren't going to give a shit about this.
What I'm asking is why anybody would use these coins, and how there could be value for them if everybody gets one for nothing, and when the currency is supported by nothing except Facebook saying they're worth something?
It's not just like Bitcoin. This is different from Bitcoin in virtually every way except for the fact that it is electronic. Of course there's no room for a 51% attack because 100% of the currency production is in Facebook's hands. It's not even a cryptocurrency. It's just Facebook play money
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:27:24
So basically you're asking if supply and demand affects the value of bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:20:26
My completely uninformed guess is that sales will run rampant and the value will plummet like a rock but like most people here I am not the expert I pretend to be

Very nice! I do have one suggestion, though. If you're going to be making Bitcoin a big selling point, you may want to list Bitcoin prices on things, at least alongside the dollar prices if nothing else.

You're missing the point.
It's not an issue of who has the best features, or whether BTC-Guild has a history of power abuse, it's an issue of who is in control. If BTC-Guild obtains 51% of the hash share, that is very bad news for everybody involved in BTC, including you. 
The lack of availability of comparable alternatives is not relevant to the situation. This is the answer to your question and this is why there is bashing in BTC-Guild's general direction

Wow this sounds totally legit and not a scam at all
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:10:10

Huh? I bought my first Bitcoins when they were less than a dollar

@_date: 2013-04-22 02:34:27
Yes, but there's more to it than that. You are using processing power to contribute to Bitcoin generation. It's not just "click button, receive Bitcoins," it's "click button, make computer do millions of calculations per second, hope to receive a fraction of pool-generated Bitcoins".

From [here]( you can expect ~380 MH/s from that setup. You're not going to get it much higher, realistically, unless you buy a new GPU.

Maybe you should stop talking so much about Bitcoin then
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:59:54


That's not quite right.
In this hypothetical, where Bitcoin has eclipsed all other currency and nobody uses dollars as currency at all, then dollars have no value in BTC (or 0 BTC, if you like). But that doesn't mean that 1 BTC = infinity dollars; 0 times infinity does not equal 1.
But even in that situation, the minimum amount that paper currency would be worth is how much it costs to print it. Even if it has no value as currency, it would still have some tiny value as paper.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:51:15

I have what coins I still have as basically change; I had to use over a hundred to buy something back then and what I have is left over.
I'm not in this to make money, but I do believe in a future for Bitcoin, as trite as that sounds, so I don't see how I'm not "in the market for long."

People are concerned, whether justifiably so or not, that BTC-Guild will - with a disproportionate amount of mining versus other miners - end up controlling 51% of the total hash share. At that point, they virtually control Bitcoin, which is a huge problem because that violates many of the fundamental aspects of the currency

@_date: 2013-04-22 02:38:01
No, it's not, and I just explained why. If there was a button you could push to give you Bitcoins, that would be a different scenario. It would be no different than just clicking a link on your browser, for instance.
You are doing calculations to hopefully solve a block, contributing to actual work being done by thousands of other people in your pool (or nobody else, if you are crazy enough to mine solo). There is value in this work. You aren't just pulling Bitcoins out of thin air.

@_date: 2013-04-22 02:24:52
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:24:48
Unless it is.
These "investors" put their money in as Bitcoin appeared to be on its way up, expecting a relatively short and large return on their investment. Foolish as that might have been, their money - "potential" money, if you like - is now gone. They can't get it back, they can't even get half of it back.
There's no assurance that Bitcoin will ever be back where it was when they bought, and especially for "non-believers" (a term I don't like very much, but whatever) the mass freak-outs and the media frenzies make things look very grim indeed. 
To somebody in this situation, saying, "calm down because it will maybe go up again" is not reassuring. Their "potential money" was real money, and now it's real gone.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:18

@_date: 2013-04-11 21:20:42
You made a very poor financial decision and you are paying for it. It's really shitty, but that's how it goes
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:23:54
I sold enough to cover my initial buy-in ages ago. I'm holding some bitcoins but I sold a couple just so I could take part in the madness tonight
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:31:38
Can we not
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:21:28
It... it does lag. I think you're using that shitty meme wrong
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:28:00
Just because they say it's DDoS doesn't mean it's DDoS
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:42:13
And by "it will definitely" you mean "I am kind of hoping it will"
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:31:07
I AM NOW PANICKING
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:36:30
...to say nothing of the huge quantities of money they're throwing at something they perceive to be a sure thing, but really is completely unpredictable
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:27:42
A lot of people think that but who the fuck knows at that point, it's defied any genuinely accurate predictions thus far
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:41:32
Do you remember where you purchased them from?
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:24:22
I'm not sure I see your point. Yeah, you can donate by Bitcoin, but there's also a big PayPal donation button right next to it
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:14:54
So far fetched that the link doesn't even go anywhere
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:14:51
Why don't you hire somebody who knows what they're doing
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:41:34
Yeah right
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:23:26
It doesn't really look like you proved much of anything
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:21:44
I don't think the panic is over yet
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:46:16
He's trolling you, fool. You're asking to multiply your initial investment by 1000. This is achievable only by sorcery
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:28:27
I might consider that too. I won't do it, but I will definitely consider it
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:03:12
I sold two just now for $105 a pop after not doing any trading in more than a year. I just want to be a part of the forthcoming Goxpox
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:17:04
Shitty math and lazy counting added up to about 56000 Bitcoin in that image.
With my exchange's current rate that's about 4.5 million dollars, insanity 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:12:15
But I can't lose. It's going up to $1000 in an hour
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:29:16
Which is just great if you want 10,000
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:27:58
And then immediately fall to the ground
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:14:51
...or then again maybe not
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:29:01


@_date: 2013-04-19 23:46:33
The price goes back above 100 and suddenly the extreme pessimism turns into near-hysterical optimism
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:41:08
That is indeed what the quote says
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:52:48
Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:13:10
That's the lamest speculation I've seen on the price drop yet
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:49:24
...are you talking about Mt.Gox?
Are you from the past?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:25:48
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:32:53
Don't I know it. My exchange is alive and running, but completely frozen in time except for the short bursts when Mt.Gox is running. Suddenly the whole thing leaps into activity and then Mt.Gox stops and everything goes still again.
This has been an interesting night
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:22:30
Fuck off with the memes already
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:27:37
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:13:22
This idea makes no sense to me. Where's the value? How can you use these coins? Who in their right minds would use a currency centralized by Facebook, of all things?
Further, most people on Facebook aren't going to care about their one coin they get for free. They're not going to do anything with it and it's just going to end up sitting there in any case
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:28:44
Well, I'm no expert, but I'll give it a shot.
1. This is kind of redundant because this is a line of thought that Bitcoin is specifically trying to circumvent. Legal control of the currency by a government defeats the purpose. Still, I'm not quite sure what he's getting at here; "the government forces people to accept money as payment" doesn't really seem like a trust-based problem with Bitcoin to me. Maybe I'm wrong.
2. There are a number of exchanges which take anonymous cash deposits from real-world banks which do not reveal your banking information.
3. Okay, but that's an issue of misinformation. It's pretty easy to understand if you spend a few minutes looking at it, and it's not inherent to Bitcoin, but rather its users.
4. Bitcoin is not "a beta." There might be a better cryptocurrency in the future but that's a non-issue for the present.
5. This has already happened (see Litecoin, Terracoin, Namecoin, a million others) and it's not a problem as far as I can see.
6. A possibly legitimate concern, but then this is sort of in opposition to the first point, which insists that there be legal control of Bitcoin. You can't have legal control and lack of legal control simultaneously.
7. Satoshi has little or nothing to do with Bitcoin's operation as a currency, so this is a useless point. His lack of a presence is hardly a concern on any front.
8. This is only a problem when you don't consider Bitcoin a "real currency" in the first place, and if you're trading in it. It does not affect Bitcoin's worth as a currency in its own right, necessarily.
9. Ridiculous. This is no more a problem with Bitcoin than any money being handled electronically. If you're careful, theft should not be a problem.

Jesus tapdancing Christ I am sick of seeing that chart
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:14:01
Man I am so glad I decided to stay up tonight    
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:37:03
Honestly I'm not really sure what I'm in it for anymore
