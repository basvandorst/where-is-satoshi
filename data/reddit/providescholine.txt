Yup. I made that mistake, bought .25 bitcoin...on 10/18. Now I'm waiting for "delivery" estimated 10/24. Oops.

thanks everyone!
(early moronic monday question: What would be th ebest way to sell it? embed coinbase 'buy' buttons on a site? direct to consumer auction?)

Me three. Six days straight...,

missed that sub 600 drop by like 10 minutes....
&amp; now she's climbing again.  &amp; coinbase is all "exceeded"
volatility: no better way to guarantee all night monitor adherence...

Hey. Cool stuff! 
I drew a BTC thing last week and tho I uploaded it earlier, thought id share again: 
The only subversive thing about my piece is that it's on some old ass financial paper. 
What about a artBTC sub?
Keep on keepin on.

I hope it's true. Read a lot of posts about them being reasonable when contacted. 
My second buy (a whopping BTC .25!) was cancelled due to being high-risk and I'm awaiting customer services response to my emails. Meantime, I'm Giving them the benefit of the doubt and Trying to be patient. 
Side note: tried to verify my id w/coinbase last night and two of the four challenge ?'s weren't relevant or related to my past history at all, so I "failed" that challenge. Will try later if course. (After posting my story everywhere in an attempt to relieve my new dad financial woes/worries/anxiety/terror. Sigh).

FWIW I'm so sorry for what you've been through. Stay strong  for yourself and for your daughter.

(i know its not monday, so pardon my possibly moronic question)
How would I export from coinbase to multibit?
And then how do I back up wallet to a usb?
thank you.
