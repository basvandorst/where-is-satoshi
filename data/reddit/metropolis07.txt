I've been waiting to pull the trigger to see if we broke up or down out of that sideways movement... This sure as hell did it.  Even ate some coinbase fees... Tapped out of usd after this dip.

Man, I've been itching to talk to someone about this...  So here's what I saw play out.  I was watching the depth chart and orderbook on GDAX like a hawk as this wall came up.  100 btc at $100 increments.  The moment that wall came up, there were buy orders for 25, 16, 18 btc right around 15k.  Then all through that night there were a flood of bot (assuming) .1 btc sells.  For like 12 hrs...   Just a hunch, but someone was flooding the orderbook with red sells in conjuction with that wall and was buying up a ton of btc.  In the sea of red sale orders I'd see a big order of over 10 coins.  I pulled the trigger on orders as I saw those big numbers come in...  I think the Korea news dropped it randomly further that it would have gone and unfortunately hit my stops.  It seems like someone is loading up.  Coincidence of Jamie Dimon changing his tune on the same day?  Who knows... Here's hoping btc gets a huge pump though either through that wall or when it comes down.  Really curious which it does when we get up to it.

So you're buying when the price stagnates?

I've been wondering the same... though different charts have a bit of a different take.  But look at [this]( snipped from the 1 day chart on GDAX... Sure looks like the bull trap.  Note the early November first sell off.  This chart looks pretty damn prescriptive, but I guess time will tell...

Do you think this run could have been futures traders running the price to short it and then dump their coin to ensure the short?

Agreed on some points.  I generally fall into the categories you suggest.  But I'm also a realist and am willing to strategize and fight for things I believe in.  Libertarians still run for office.  ICO's are launched daily for companies (hopefully) building something.  The ico is often a mechanism for a for-profit Corp to be funded by the crypto community.  Why couldn't we build a non profit Corp, launch an ICO with a treasury that perpetually funds lobbying, promotion, etc for the crypto 'industry'.  We sure as hell want to control the message.  If the community does or doesn't support the token, they'll vote with their dollars... In a potentially trillion+ dollar market/industry.  A few million bucks is nothing, but could have enormous value long term.  Every industry in the world lobbies for their constituents.  Market sentiment is the name of the game here especially if we all bank on mass adoption.  Again, we want to craft that message.  Not some schmuck on CNBC or capital hill.

Here's hoping Wall Street sees a buying opportunity in the crypto markets as equities slump... Timing couldn't be better.
