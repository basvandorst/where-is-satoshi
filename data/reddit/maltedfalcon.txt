yes your estate's books would show you bought a lot of bitcoins.
however unlike with a will there would be no transaction of where the money went.  So the taxes could not be levied. If done to the extreme, the  estate of the deceased would be a hollow shell that would be taken in lien by the govt. but the value of the estate would be gone...

Oh i'm not taking about hacking it. I'm talking about making it un-popular or users so-insecure about using it that it would die off. I think that's a more likely method for those who want to get rid of it to use.  
@_date: 2012-11-29 21:47:05
yes that is exactly what I am talking about but on a much larger scale.
oh my point is the bank would not look like a govt bank, it would be operated as if it were just another bitcoiner business but with really good capitol funding. they would offer great services and interest rates, until everybody was "sure" of them and then they would just collapse like a house of cards taking everybodies bitcoins with them.

The Bitcoin wiki was also down this morning
@_date: 2012-11-30 18:02:52
but for the banks or Govt this is a negligible amount...
@_date: 2012-11-29 20:47:57
Imagine if there were Bitcoin banks that were considered "safe" and easy to use, people would go there/ use there services/  a couple years pass they might even be the default place to go, lots of bitcoins kept there gathering interest. Then suddenly "poof" its all gone. What would that do to the bitcoin economy, (imagine Pirate40 but on a huge  long term scale.)
@_date: 2012-11-29 21:48:23
my point is they aready want to kill it. but what out of the box methods will they try to use, and how do we spot them so as to avoid them.
@_date: 2012-11-30 00:07:39
on the other hand the US has been waging actual  war on international drug smugglers for decades, hows that going. 
 however Criminalization would also have the effect of in a way validating Bitcoin for some people.  
@_date: 2012-08-20 18:16:38
Actually no,
 they IRS is geared up to deal with investigating large cash transactions - people try it all the time.
getting large amounts of cash shows up and then is trackable. Would be a huge red flag to the IRS. Then you have a huge pile of cash you have to deal with. making you or your heirs a target of theives... How do you make sure it gets to your heirs, If you  give it to your heirs before you die, then yes they have it, but you don't and you cant use it.  If you keep it until you die ,then you have to trust that that much cash got to where you wanted it to...
With cash you have no assurance of delivery- your cash withdrawls will be trackable   and investing in bitcoins you could take care of at the very last minute. -

I think the simplist way to attack bitcoin would not be to attack the currency, but perhaps to attack anyone who accepted bitcoin
Denial of Service attacks, spoofing./  Bitcoin is secure but how about the database on the merchants computer?
@_date: 2012-11-29 23:26:00
Again I clarify , I said a bitcoin wallet is like a piggybank, not bitcoin itself.
however I point at this link
   to point out the FBI is actively working at destroying things like bitcoin.   My original question is how will they do it.  Assuming they cant is just naive.
 So my best guess is they will create something mtgox like that is attractive and seems stable- They will pay interest enough to make it seem silly to keep your bitcoins in your wallet.  They will offer all kinds of perks to make themselves popular, and the default place to go and save and trade and invest. it might last for years and then ... poof. 
@_date: 2012-11-29 22:59:09
no a bitcoin wallet is a piggy bank. did you not read my post?
so if you were offered interest on a bitcoin investment you would not want it since the raising value of bitcoins would be enough for you?
clearly you dont understand finance.
@_date: 2012-11-29 23:04:40
That answer is very US-centric. there is a whole world out there that will use Bitcoin reguardless of US laws. even if not a single american used it. Sooner or later it will be the currency of the Internet, and that scares banks and the govt since they dont control it.  This really wouldnt affect BitCoin at all. It would work about as well as the time they outlawed owning gold. - not at all.
@_date: 2012-11-30 18:03:50
yes but how will they cause it. or are you saying that is already there?
@_date: 2018-11-03 16:05:03
Have you seen the fees bitcoin atms charge?  "Steal" is the correct word
@_date: 2012-11-29 21:44:02
a bank does more than just hold and transfer money
a bank should actually (doesnt happen much now) pay you to hold your money, then they take that aggregated money and invest it to make the money they use to pay you.  A bank would loan you more money based on the money you have invested with them.  
No a Bitcoin wallet is not a bitcoin bank.  it is more of a piggy bank than a real bank.  - you discount the fact that if using a real savings bank, you get interest above the increase in value you get anyway.
@_date: 2012-08-21 19:22:10
This is very similar however you still exist, you have other assets. you would need to be prepared for audits and liens and investigations.
a dead person would not be affected by any of these things.  Thats why its the perfect place to hide estate wealth from death taxes...
@_date: 2013-01-26 19:18:30
oh sorry, 
He doesnt actually need to take them away he can simply outlaw there use. he can require isps to track and report bitcoin transactions to/from known bitcoin sites. so even if they have no idea what is in the transaction the transaction occuring would be enough.  Yes I realize you could use an anonymizer and leap through all kinds of hoops to hide your transactions but most people would just not do it at all.
I suspect the other countries would follow the us's lead or enought that it would have a large impact. Most countries hate the idea of the independence the internet brings and would be happy to take steps against that.
@_date: 2013-01-25 23:18:31
and again during an "Emergency" the Fifth Amendment wont apply. Once the Emergency is over things would need to go back to normal though.
@_date: 2013-01-25 23:28:26
Except that during an Emergency the president has the power to suspend all or any part of the constitution.
Also unless he were under oath, whatever he said in his passphrases would not be considered testimony against himself.
@_date: 2013-01-26 00:22:59
The article has to do with presidential powers when related to banking crisis. (of which they are trying to use that information to sell gold) 
but that doesn't mean its not pertinent 
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:41:15
I would use offshore hosting for the website and bitcoin address. Effectively making myself a foreign company with a local shipping address.
@_date: 2013-01-28 04:58:33
Actually I do very well,
however your anonymous p2p transaction has a foot print. It looks like an anonymouse p2p transaction. if ISPs were looking for and reporting these.
Thats one way.
another way is your connections to mt gox Dwolla or similar, would be noticed. If all those websites stopped working or were monitored it would almost be too much trouble to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:30:06
and yet we have had a pretty decent discussion about the ramifications of this article and bitcoin, and the intelligence/stupidity of switching a website to bitcoin only.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:57:27
If suddenly everything on the Internet were taxed like this, I for-see a sudden upswing in bitcoin adoption.  
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:05:24
what you mean to say is "you are currently using a device that you can invest your time in and use to handily do this task for you."   You casually ignore the loss and cost of time that will be incurred in this effort.
@_date: 2013-01-25 23:13:09
you are assuming this would happen in a court of law where they would care that you were incriminating yourself. it wouldnt and they wouldnt.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:14:22
you are correct, and I agree that the most likely outcome will simply be to close my websites.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:01:12
My websites are basically a hobby that pays for itself. If I have to deal with taxes and the Franchise Tax Board and the IRS I will either close them or switch.
Currently 99% of my customers are from overseas, so I really dont have that problem now, if I did have to keep track of taxes the hobby suddenly becomes a lot less fun.
@_date: 2013-01-25 23:32:09
The bottom line here, is if the president sees Bitcoins as a "threat" to the national economy, in any way, he can get away with just about anything in the name of battling that threat.
And in the past (Roosevelt) it has been done.  
I love bitcoins! but its not immune from government interference as most redditors think. It really just hasn't been noticed yet.
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:14:35
?????? Huh?
@_date: 2013-01-26 03:49:41
Ahh, that is a common mis-conception. unlike other countries, As a citizen of the United States of America, we are expected to keep our government in check, so we examine things like this and discuss them. In reality, the government is afraid of us and that is how it should be
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:11:34
My wife concurs.
@_date: 2013-01-25 23:12:08
Just like the revolution that happened when roosevelt required all americans to turn in their gold. (at a loss)
 
Bitcoiners are a fringe group, and if they were portrayed as a danger to the "normal" everyday american, most americans would support whatever was required to protect their normal economy.  I seriously dont think the masses would rise up like you think.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:11:03
Sadly my Grandmother is dead, however if it makes you happy I have cousins who use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-01-28 15:22:26
you could but you would have no idea if the person you were buying from was a policeman.  My point being all of these issues would not make it impossible. It would just become too much of a bother to continue and it would die off in the US, with just a few people continuing to use it.
It would be effectively dead.
@_date: 2013-01-25 23:17:02
Its not the commerce clause, its the Emergency Banking Relief Act, A tested and used and still in force presidential power. that basically allows for anything during "the Emergency"
@_date: 2013-01-04 05:10:30
Well that was kind of the point, the question was if they care this much about banks laundering money, what will they do about bitcoin if it becomes a hotbed of money laundering?
@_date: 2013-01-02 22:13:08
You should know how to use bitcoins, so that if in an emergency, you know zombiepocolypse,foreign  invasion, or Marshal law, you will be able to barter and avail yourself of whatever black/grey market pops up.
@_date: 2013-01-26 03:51:27
Noticed as in "oh look a threat, Stomp on it"
@_date: 2013-01-25 22:34:22
I love reading the posts saying "They can't outlaw bitcoins!"
of course they can.
You guys do realize from 1933 to 1975 it was illegal to own gold.
in 1974 they made it legal to own again. but.They didnt get rid of the law which basically gives the president the power to do just about anything to preserve the currency of the US.
Without congress doing anything he could outlaw bitcoins and require all americans to turn in their encryption passwords. Would this kill bitcoin? maybe not but it would seriously impact adoption world wide and take a large # of Bitcoin out of circulation.   They would just throw a few million dollars of supercomputes onto mining and then never release the coins they mine.  
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:09:18
It is possible that Internet Taxation would be the "Killer App" that will drive bitcoin adoption.  I believe that the "Tipping Point" will occur and there will be a mass adoption.
I do see your point, however My Grandmother wouldn't be one of my customers anyway...
@_date: 2013-01-26 00:24:08
If it really really went underground, where would new users learn about it?
it would stagnate pretty quickly I would think.
