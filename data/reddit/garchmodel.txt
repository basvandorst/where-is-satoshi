i realise how retarded a lot of people are. tbh bitcoin needs to be "used" to understand it, use the bitcoin.qt wallet and it will make so much sense, go on blockchain.info read the white paper, understand how cryptography works anyway it's one of those things where it takes time

That's because your usd is being devalued because of inflation; btc's value is derived by its demand and its inflation as any other currency.

@_date: 2018-10-04 15:34:38
true but the power isn't just in de currency its in the assets, currency is a language of 'value' that's all if you supply paper for ever you get inflation but its a difficult concept to grasp, SLOW EROSION OF MONEY. the common people will say that prices are going up because of greedy corporations (its not entirely true). anyhow good luck out there this BUBBLE is the MONSTER OF ALL BUBBLES..

@_date: 2017-08-02 21:24:25
Pretty much the answer every one gives when the first hear about bitcoin; but u can tell he is a slave to the system and backs the dollar because it's the "norm". I mean it's true bitcoin are created out of thing air just like money is, but it has a protocol that is 1000 times more logic and more "humanist" than the current rhetoric from central bankers. It's really the system vs the people here i think...   the real issue is scarcity and population growth.... not who decides what is money and what is not.
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:43:51
Well yes, ask yourself this simple question... who decides on the budget laws etc ...?

ouch yes you nailed it on the head. but bitcoin isn't a stock; it's value comes from its scarcity and other aspects. its currency

ha was gunna check
@_date: 2019-10-21 20:06:45
what if in the process the whole fiat system
collapses and loses 99% you'd always be better off owning btc or another asset
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:05:09
not a lot of
people, most were still on the side lines 
i think (with the help of central banks dovishness) all asset will see tremendous  gains in the next 6 months
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:14:24
so some assets do better than others and you just wished over the last few hours you had not held btc. it's the market, don't do anything in that case
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:13:21
you compared stocks to bitcoin i wonder who is most retarded

it won't matter, the same way the entire system relies on loose monetary policy, assets in general (including btc) will go to highs no one would have ever imagined. it's mechanical. the only big issue is ... "when the music stops everything will come crushing down" as it always been in the past

This graph depicts the amount of people that put trust in crypto vs. "traditional" assets. It's only a matter a time before people realizes that it's easier to transfer wealth than any other existing assets at the moment. The size of the crypto market will increase exponentially in the next couple of years.

Jamie dimon or anyone of the "old" folks who never understood the concept of P2p torrent who thinks that because the piratebay had issue it's now impossible to use torrents. When they suddenly becomes expert on bitcoin issues because they heard it on the news is really making me laugh

i think every version of btc has the right to exist but it should have to create a completely new coin just to be asic resistant (amongst other things) it breaks the idea of bitcoin everytime you fork imo. I think this is a well formed scam and it will be less popular than bcc because its the second fork but i dont know well see

because it's not bitcoin? and because what happened to bcc and people just want the free coin and sell it and avoid what bcc is going through (even if at some point it does get more popular) it will take time

It's not bad... per se.. however this is the world we live in; I trade in futures all day long and when I have a huge position to buy in futures I buy it from a bank that will hedge the sale of these futures by buying the underlying ... volumes in derivative are 1000x bigger (notional wise) then in spot that's just how it is because no "funds" are moved or just barely any

Looking at btc wiki page and price has a good correlation but causation is a different thing. You don't open your book every time you answer a question looking for help. You have "memory". The time series on wiki searches should use that fact

Moral hazard allows for this kind of behavior. Basically you keep the profits/interest gained and in case of default; get bailed out using more debt paid back by the people as a whole ... this is a vicious cycle of musical chairs in the end

That's like doom theory, I don't have much optimism for society as a whole but when it comes to crisis they only real losers are all the middle class leymen that are being increasingly taxed and worked for longer years...

if you think about it only banks can lend multiple times the money in circulation leading to more money chasing the same amount of assets so they aren't creating value; but only inflating prices with debt. perhaps banks are responsible of the last equity; bond, crypto, real estate bubble by lending money to but for the same amount of goods
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:16:32
what is sad is that i completely agree with the below/above but if we were ever to have a bitcoin standard it would mean that btc would be worth unimaginable amounts but would only benefit those few, savy, cany, economist, scientist, futurist, liberators, etc etc etc to become IMMENSELY wealthy and have 98.999 of the population have just nothing. a bit like Real estate over the past 30years in large metropolitan areas? who's withme?

That is just what virwox is taking for such order type. Note that the more you trade you get commission discounts which can make a limit order quickly cheaper than a market order. Everything is explained in their virwox.com/help section. I guess this is just an incentive for heavy traders to trade more...
