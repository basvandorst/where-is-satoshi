And now I know this story is fake 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:58:23
Does the vegeta meme ever get another chance? I mean honestly we waited AGES to use it and it lasted for one whole day 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:27:04
Wait.. that's not when we are supposed to sell? I've been doing it backwards:(
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:39:57
Maybe a nibble 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:39:28
No she's a bitch with two mouses now. She talked shit on my Bitcoin I let her sit there and look like an idiot 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:07:57
I am in complete favor of this. The only ads on Facebook are for scam ICOs. There has never been a single add about crypto that helped the community on Facebook 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:45:45
Go to my YouTube channel and you'll see me check out my bitconnect account in most recordings. YouTube name is dogness.. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:20:31
I talk about other things and sometimes I go over what I made on bitconnect. He asked for proof it's there. I could care less what you think 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:40:09
This is completely false. With no referrals I have withdrawn over 4x what I originally put in. I have that in my wallet and off of the platform. If you are uneducated on bitconnect stop commenting about it 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:11:33
No actually. He asked for proof I told him where it can be found. Could care less about your affiliate bonus 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:50:41
San Diego loves Bitcoin too!!  
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:11:42
Search dogness on YouTube you're dead wrong 
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:31:15
378k :(
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:25:41
Oops idiot most videos I even expressly say do your own research and there's only a couple times I even list a referral link in any of them but OK idiot idiot idiot idiot 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:29:25
Yeah I don't even get any so be more butt hurt.. I merely stated and provided a place for proof that I have made a profit from their platform 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:31:44
Where???? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:51:13
Yeah stay classy idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:33:51
The whole purpose of it was to get more users. It's not at all about the price 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:04:51
Why. Electricity is almost free in other countries 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:04:18
Number one at Wars too so does it really matter 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:30:38
Bitcoin is a war. We don't want to play by the rules set before us any longer and we demand a system that puts the people before the corruption currency has thus far created. We deserve a system that give the people control of their money again. If you don't think crypto is the future you're in for the rudest awakening of your life. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:48
I call bullshit 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:41:22
Unless we get free power it won't 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:57:20
We as in Bitcoin. Not bcash 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:32
You are so brave! I hope it all ends up well for you friend 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:34:12
But it is a cancer to the community as a whole 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:44
Stay strong friends Bitcoin is your retirement. Don't settle for anything less. You as an early adopter to the future deserve nothing less than what you believed in when you started. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:59:02
Bitcoin done right 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:56:06
Wow what a lucky guy 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:51:18
Good people lose money on bcash when they are misdirected. I would say earning their attention and doing right by them is slightly important for our community 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:45:40
Anyone who looks at their sub today tho will have a poor taste in their mouth for Bitcoin which is more my point 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:01:55
If you have to ask. Not yet 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:48:10
It's not about a market effect. If you believe in the adoption of Bitcoin you would want people to have easy access to correct and good info on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:00:09
Fucking someone finally said it. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:38:38

If you know about bitcoin you know he’s a scammer. The best we can do is educate people coming in as best we can

It’s an ethereum erc20 token and it’s essentially a utility that is being used for casinos to lower the operating and licensing costs. Platform release with the first casinos is in a few weeks and from there they are releasing the platform to more casinos  as they get the first casinos up to speed and comfortable with the entire platform 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:13:34
This is actually a pretty genius game. I like it

@_date: 2018-05-06 18:54:32
I took pictures of my calculations on my abacus and mailed it to the network. When do I get my bitcoin?

No do not use that website. It’s the scam website that tricks you in to buying bcash which is not bitcoin

@_date: 2017-11-20 22:51:10
There's the math I wanted
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:11:57

@_date: 2017-11-25 18:20:31
This is an amazing edit! Great job dude

Does anyone else see what’s happening or is me mentioning it going to cause a reversal? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:06:02
Is there seriously a website for this lol

If I go to the gym for one hour that's 120 refreshes of the Bitcoin price I'll miss over my health. When's the last time my health has ever taken me to the moon anyways?

I really wish this weren’t true ��

I had a guy who's girlfriend I know hit me up out of the blue about Bitcoin because we talked about it at a party a while ago. He's never once texted me before but yesterday decides it's a good time to be friends and starts asking me how my bitcoins are doing lol 
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:40:09
Let me be the voice of reason here. I think you should just call them on Monday 
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:13:18
If it hits 10k by 8 am eastern I’ll do something stupid. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:41:00
The mt gox thing is just FUD.. keep your coins and don't sell them! Set some cash aside to buy when we see another drop in price tho! 
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:54:28
Well yeah it’s legit. Pablo Escobar’s family is known for their honesty and business etiquette

Did you eat a tide pod?? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:46:19
Exactly what I mean. The 40k didn't cause anything. Now that people know about it and that it kind of lines up with the crash were apparently freaking out that 40k/21m coins are back on the market. Makes 0 sense 
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:42:27
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:13:35
Ooof right in the mining contract feels 
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:13:36

Is there any relevance to severe bull runs and Chinese New Year? All signs would point to yes 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:11:39
No you're wrong, it's a great time to buy some Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:56:53
No. Sell all your Bitcoin asap

True but a direct funnel to the rich should be blocked to some degree. Who is to say the other vices aren't going to their pockets anyways because that money totally is. Our world is a strange place

I like trump and I agree with this statement 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:32:36
I think it may be the other way around more than likely 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:12:03
Totally not a scam 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:39:47
There was a post about this a while ago and it was scary 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:35:38
But would you buy mine for that price? I hear it's going to 100k seems a good deal to me ��
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:47:24
Dude seriously calm down. Many of the generation know the exact terms and can cite them from memory but some people reference them loosely. I'm sure you're the god king of investing but he's probably newer than you. Instead of being rude try being constructive. Else wise why even bother? Go be bitter somewhere else 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:30:25

That is an extremely poor taste..

A bear market for now is welcomed. We can buy cheap coins again 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:02:58
If you knew why do you seem so hurt and surprised 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:35:41
40k coins didn't crash the market. 1800 coins are mined every day. Most miners have to sell a lot of coins just to upkeep electricity and facilities. If you actually believe this crash is because of 40k coins entering the market you're crazy. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:28:13
This was one of my favorites!! Man I love how crashes bring us together and give the old memes some life

I'll still have mine :) 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:10:12
And when the poor 1000 dollar saps get their money taken away they will cry for government intervention. I fully agree is poor people shouldn't be allowed to invest that way. Smart crafty old men will steal our money all day long

So stay in Mexico and you won't?

Can't wait to see vegeta memes again :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:44:22
I'm not saying I agree with the government telling what we can and can not do but there are too many morons in this world to not have rules to protect them from their own stupidity.

Vegeta 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:55:54
I have so many fond memories on lord of ultima myself. Winning on a server felt amazing and I know they made tons of money even tho p2w had a daily cap you could use. I won't ever buy another EA game again after the way they just killed an amazing game and community of players 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:18:41
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:50:17
I didn't get too into that one but I will forever hate EA for shutting down the ultima server because they weren't making millions on it like they did FIFA. I'm going to college for CS because I want to make something similar to the ultima games. I would love to bring back how unique they were and I know so many people who are sad EA was like no it's just going away forever. I don't feel like a lot of games capture that niche anymore. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:06:17
Just wait. It's happened to millions of people. The economy is devastated. A corporation too big to fail took everyone's money when in no way they should have been allowed to. It's already happened. People are too stupid to invest in some things 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:55:13
You're here to tell me we should be able to invest all our money in complete scams if we want and lose everything? You know the world has progressed past slavery right? Stupid people in first world countries get certain protections against themselves here. Otherwise they would be slaves again 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:43:11

Don't let the door hit you on the way out! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:12:07
How? It's completely relevant. If enough idiots lose money and lose everything we decimate the economy 
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:19:50
I just subbed today after following this for awhile 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:01:15
I hate EA with a passion. They just do not care about their customers or fan base. Eventually people will be fed up with them and they won't make money. As for me I'm just going to capitalize on the business they just threw away. Study hard and give them the big middle finger when it's a success and they just threw it to the side because it wasn't FIFA 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:23:03
Even if he had you dead to rights most blackmailers don't have the balls to do it.

You jinxed it! 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:29:21
When it dropped to 6k I said oh that's nice. I bought some more. I'm laughing at the weak hands who sold at 6-8k. I can't believe it made a lick of sense to hold for so long and then sell at the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:04
Hmm I checked last night and the average time over the entire day was 13 minutes.. I'm assuming it was an unlucky day and it just reset so it must have skewed the other way overnight

@_date: 2018-03-09 19:38:19
Sure the dump could have escalated it but this was a massive sell off of coins. If the remaining 160k get dumped the market will absorb it. Once it got down to the 6k area there was a ton of support and buyers and I doubt we'll get that lucky again 
@_date: 2018-07-13 18:39:12
Can I have some of whatever you are on?

Mining IS NOT a scam. It may not be as good as an investment as HODLing coins but I’ve had genesis mining for ages now and I have zero complaints about it. It’s also a great way to show people about crypto when you get daily payments and they go oh what’s that.
