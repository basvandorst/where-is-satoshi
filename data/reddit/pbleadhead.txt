bitcoin is FOR conservatives.
It is the liberals that need the ability to print fiat money to pay for all their "free stuff" and "redistribute".

good Mr. [R]. doing things right. thanks.

There is nothing wrong with wealth inequality.
nothing at all.
What IS wrong, is trying to force things to be "more equal" via the barrel of a gun.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:01:48
Ah. that explains the block.
Quite annoying.
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:36:18
huh. Intresting. I was planning to do something similar (3000 bits/person) to all my RL friends via facebook at 12:00 am Jan 1. cool stuffs.
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:37:58
It is more about the... even number of the whole thing. see. 7 billion people divided by 21 million bitcoins gives 3000 bits. 
Call it a 'people's share'. or something.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:27:54
very odd. 
I just did as well.
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:38:05
I tried, and used the 'transfer' button, and nothing happened, but I have not given it a lot of time to think quite yet. Thanks though!

I JUST brought a brand new computer off newegg. I sure wish this promo existed two weeks ago. bummer. hell even without the promo, i would have brought with bitcoins.

fuel is a tad hard. only a very few gas stations accept it. Pizza has been going on for ages. The first thing brought with bitcoin was a pizza. just google 'pizza' and bitcoin' together. Diapers... try overstock.com 
I also dont think you are looking hard enough for trading bitcoins into dollars. Coinbase can deposit directly into a bank account. and such.
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:28:46
inequality is not bad.
trying to force things via the barrel of a gun to be "more even" is.
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:00:11
lotta people there need some bitcoin educations.
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:14:19
This is sort of bitcoin's one thing...
If the algorithm is switched, the current difficulty would be so high, that it would be near impossible to mine the next block. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:48:14
Yea. its pretty cool. However I did kinda mess up that fraction a tad. I should have said 21 million bitcoins divided by 7 billion people gives 3000 bits per person.  It is hard to divide people. you get fractions of people, and that gets messy.
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:00:15
Mt gox can not possibly be insolvent.  Any (smart? evil?) person with such a HUGE price difference between it, and everyone else, would do everything in his power to maintain that difference, and ABUSE THE SNOT OUT OF IT.
Every bitcoin that mt.gox buys from anywhere not mtgox, they can then sell for obscene profits at this point in time.
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:35:47
Wow. something I always knew, but thanks for saying it out loud. pheww.  Abortion. obamacare. Gender Identity Disorder. Deflation. climate change. immigration. Mike brown and Tavron Martin. everything. wow. 
Now. if only I could know what the next big controversy was, so I could manufacture my own bullshit to become the reality first. hmm. hmm.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:48:11
There is no problem whatsoever with this "inequality".
it happens.
What IS a problem, is when people like you try to use (indirectly, via governments) the barrel of a gun to make things "more equal".
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:05:14
Well. It depends on your definition of inflation.
Bitcoin, will inflate about 40% from now until the rest of eternity  based on current mined vs total mined.
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:49:58
why do you accept paper flappy things for your products?
Basically same reasons.
Except, when there are two currencies, one which gets debased, and one that does not... History has found that people will prefer the currency that is not debased.
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:08:00
is true democratic decision making even a good idea? two wolves and a sheep and all.
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:01:18
As long as that inequality arose from free market forces, thats ok.
Now, what is not ok, is, like for example, why wealth inequality has rose in the USA, is that the already wealthy have enough money to work around all the regulations, laws, red tape, and bull that was put in place to try to make things "more fair". 
Of course that only hurts anyone trying to move up the wealth ladder, trying to found their own business, or self-employ. its just a drop in the bucket for the well established.
Any "risk" to "democratic institutions"... well. is that, governments? or is that the tyranny of the 51% with their "free stuffs"?
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:21:39
So... do we do anything yet about this? do I file a claim for 3.74 btc?

It seems someone turned on the bot a tad ago for a bit. My monies got moved. :D

Very interested in your comments and questions.

When I started looking at bitcoin, back when bitcoin was ~20-30 dollars (the first time), !!micropayments!! was a big selling point.  I feel quite betrayed every time someone says "bitcoin isn't for micro payments."
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:32:39
No. he is just misquoted as saying that. Their vs They're.
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:31:39
misquote. If you listen to it, it is 'Their' not 'they're'. Which significantly changes the meaning of what is said.

just click his name, there is plenty of proof there.
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:48:47
That was really impressive. Could you happen to now make the price rise back to where it was before?
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:14:42
deflation is not a problem.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:28:15
you might want to explain a bit on how to retrieve that money you just gave.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:20:55
I will begin the rendering process immediately. (It will probably take overnight, though.)
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:39:02
not necessarily. there are many many voting systems where one person can have multiple votes. check em out on wikipedia.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:14:24
no because there are some many memes yet to be linked!

caught the knife and went all in at 655. knife is now goin back up it seems.
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:52:42
NOt so sure about this.
However... buying a speck of land on sealand, and setting up an exchange there, where banks cant close accounts, and governments cant try to regulate you... might be a very good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:59:03
That is fantastic. Useless. hilarious. fantastic.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:39:08
Well, i tried to sell at 880, but it didnt quite go through, which is a bummber, cause i would now be buying again.
its ok. its a really fun rollercoaster!
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:56:39
Id love to buy a few silver bitcoins! but... is that qr code the public or private key? will it be hidden like casassius coins? Personally,  0.2 BTC coins, would be pretty cools, cause... at current prices... about a 1-1 bitcoin silver ratio.
edit: nvm. just found the other thread.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:33:35
They will now... :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:59:33
dont sell all your bitcoins ever. 
but do try to sell some small fraction at highs. (like now)
The best way to make bitcoin more viable (and thus be worth more) is to make sure that the ridiculous highs and lows we are going through are smoothed out.  Many bitcoins in the hands of a few greedy people become worthless.  Some bitcoins in the hands of many means each individual bitcoin becomes worth more.   
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:12:52
Awesome! wrong side of the USA, but man, if i could use MtGox to buy bitcoins to buy MTG cards, there is just something funny about that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:05:39
Id be interested in a few 0.1 btc coins as christmas presents, but full btc is... well, expensive right now.
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:19:22
cant wait for those darned bitcoin atms to start rolling out!
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:24:48
lack of regulation is a good thing, not bad thing. We are ALL regulators, where we hold power equal to our investment.
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:07:47
Also talk a bit about customer's perspective. It is often easier to pay with bitcoins (once you have them), than other means, and able to buy cheap digital things you would not be able sell due to ridiculous fees if using paypal. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:38:46
This article doesnt mention bitcoin at all. It certainly should. no comment section either to say. "Here is the solution: ..."

 if you want to check it.
They even gave it a nice description! 
"YouTuber Pbleadhead created this When I’m Bored remix video summing up the Bitcoin crypto-currency in just 24 seconds."
10 hour version for those that think 24 seconds of bitcoin is clearly not enough bitcoin is rendering, and will be done hopefully before midnight.
I am internet famous, guys!
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:50:33
umm. sure. if you have the money, You can do this super easy. Just buy every bitcoin up to 1000, and then erect a huge buy wall there. blam. bitcoin price pegged for as long as you have money.
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:35:03
The way bitcoin works, if taxes were actually fair in a particular country, It would be very very easy to set up a bitcoin client with a 'pay taxes' button, which quickly looks at your transaction history, and wisks off the appropriate, fixed, and constant percent of your received transactions since the last time you pressed the button to the federal 'pay your taxes here' bitcoin address.  but the government would never allow taxes to be so easy. all the tax auditors, and irs agents would lose their jobs and that huge portion of the economy wasted on working around the tax code would be redirected to useful purposes. ;_;

I am currently writing a little letter. Just a declaration of an idea that in this day and age of inter connectivity, where we can talk to anyone anywhere on the world instantaneously, that the idea that rules of law are set by ones location to be a little out dated.  That the idea that living in location A, means something different for you than location B, is silly. And that there should be a way that one's rights do not change if you hop across a magical line called a "border". 
It is just an idea. But truly, with the age of the internet, we can do better. We can have a better system of government. We can solve the problems (imagined or real) of gerrymandering, politicians being brought, the two party system, the spoiler effect, and a persons vote or voice seemingly not matter. 
And we can solve those problems with bitcoin. 
It is very hard, but occasionally I imagine a government with no location, and no buildings, where unpaid representatives meet with webcams, where, with A voting system based on the bitcoin protocol, people can vote for who they want at any time, and each representative gets votes EXACTLY equal to how many people are voting for them at any time. One could even vote for themselves, and have a say at the table.   I imagine a government whose rules exist everywhere and no where, and all one has to do is simply declare, "This is my country, now." and be done with it.
It will not be easy, but it is not just a fantasy. The old ways will resist with deadly force, as they always have, but in the end I believe it will be worth it. 
but those days are a long way off.
For now, I hide in the shadows, working on the little bits. Drafting a new declaration of independence of the individual, and a new constitution of a digital state.
but eventually I will need some way to spread my idea, inform others of what freedom truly is.  And that, quite simply, costs money.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:19:16
I think that answer is really simple. no matter what the economists say about what kind of currency is better for an economy... people will cling to money that holds its value and will let go of money that is set to lose 2% or more of its value per year.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:39:50
