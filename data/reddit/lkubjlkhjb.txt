And the socialists (yeah, outside of America they are real people, not only some kind of devil you hear about on Fox news!) claim that central banks are the evil made of capitalism. Everyone hates on the same thing...

Not punny enough, try again!

Every language in the world, except for the giants English and Spanish I would say... That is 2 languages of all the 6500 spoken languages existing today [source]( 
Native speakers of English and Spanish, be glad!

We all think we speak our second languages perfectly, but in reality that's hardly the case. Me, I'm mostly imitating what people write in English on the web, and how they speak on american tv &amp; movies. Now the imitations are good enough to use for communication. 
Gudarna ska veta att vi har en viss övertro om våra andraspråkskunskaper.

That is a creative idea, and I imagine would give an intuitive UI. +1

Putting that OpenBazaar survey in the beginning or end of the shopping process front-end has nothing to do with decentralisation. Just a question of "annoying questions before exciting shopping" VS "exciting shopping and just a couple of questions before checkout"

Haha so true. One tip I can recommend is setting your browser to request english language by default. Swedish websites are going to be in Swedish anyways, but international ones will have correct wording. MVH

Swede here living in Germany, speaking German as my third language (which means I'm pretty bad at it). These translations are easier for me to understand, the original one I'd have to read twice to grok. Vielen Dank.

Is the difference as pronounced as between the Englishes? The one spoken by the English themselves, the others on the British Isles who speak English as first/second language, and the ones living in former colonies (USA, Canada, Australia, India, just about every freaking country in the world)? 
Does Spanish differ more or less than English between countries?
