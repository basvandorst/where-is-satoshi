Ah it was probably the fact that you were advertising an altcoin by doing that. I can see why the mods wouldn't like that.

What was the context?

This reminds me of this one Android app that used to exist called Coin Tapper. How it worked was that you click a button and you get a small amount of Satoshi. You could click the button a limited amount of times in a day but you didn't have to wait between button presses.
The app had ads which I believe were supposed to appear every time you pressed the button, however since I had AdAway installed, no ads appeared at all so I could just spam click the button to get a bunch of Satoshi in one go.
The app shut down at one point though so I guess other people were abusing that lol.

When did you enable 2FA? If you enabled it in the past few months, you're just as insecure as not having 2FA as the key for it was also leaked.
