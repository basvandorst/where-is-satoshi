Why wouldnt you be able to claim your losses in your alts?
If you showed $500k of assests in your 2017 return, then bought all the alts at the highest points and then lost 90% of your value, why cant you claim your losses?

Thats where we are at? Purposefully masking asset names out of fear that it could hurt your asset or promote another asset? WOW.

I see where your coming from but I really see that as more opinion and less efficiency.
I want to see the comments on the twitter post where the source came from.
But I can see your point of view also. Cheers.

How is reddit more efficient at serving images? I don't understand your comment.
Whether users are making a request against reddit,twitter or imgur they are still making a web request to a server.
Its actually cheaper for reddit if images are stored on other sites. And it doesn't make anything more or less efficient.

FYI A couple of connections/sec is not going to flood your node.
This seems normal to me. Why are you so concerned about node connections from the same subnet?
None of the information provided points to anything malicious, just a couple of systems that are trying to stay connected to your node. What if this guys is doing node research and uptime statistics? 
What exactly is the problem your trying to solve?
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:19:09
Who says its another node? Maybe its a server doing analysis on bitcoin nodes? Maybe its not configured perfectly or the way you want it to be.
I think you are jumping to conclusions saying that this 'node' is trying to ddos you. All thats happening is a system is trying to connect repeatedly to your system even though your system is rejecting the connection.
Are you concerned that they could be utilizing 2-3 bytes / sec? Is that what you consider a ddos?
I don't think you have an understanding of whats actually happening under the hood.
Edit - A network admin would just blackhole/block the traffic and call it a day.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:32:18
Fail2ban will block the connections before they hit the node, preventing new log messages from being created.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:31:36
You have not shown anything malicious at all.
You posted a text copy of a redacted ip attempting to connect to ? in 2 times a second for 3 seconds. Thats literally nothing.
If you knew what you were doing you would be running a firewall in front of this thing and if you had an example/sample of repeat malicious activity you would have packet captures, extensive traffic statistics like pps or total traffic amount over x period.
Stop trying to pretend like you know what your talking about and go take a class or atleast sleep in a marriot or some shit.
Good luck on your quest.

What does this solve? His node is still going to broadcast its new ip address.
By running a node you a running a server software that allows peers to consume a service on that server. (Validate Blocks, whatever).
The only way to prevent people from connecting to that service is to stop offering it Edit: or filter or manipulate it before it hits the server like with a layer x router or switch.
What would a new address solve?

Bitcoin is bitcoin. People compare new complex things to existing similar things they are familiar with. Yup.
Scalability. Bitcoin can scale in every sense except transaction time/volume.
I would argue that Bitcoin did not come with transaction volume scaling built-in, and the miners/nodes/exchanges/users/developers have to scale bitcoin over time.

Good luck on your quest.

This does not avoid IP altogether, it just makes it so that other nodes need to be running on tor or have a route to it. This is not a solution. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:00:52
There are no 'analysis nodes' people just write software to gather data. Anyone can connect to any open port on the internet, thats what makes the internet open. I should have stopped commenting by now but I am genuinely curious: What is the problem you are trying to solve?
Your not getting ddosed and rejected connections wont slow down your node.

Go and buy a usb to sata converter. $8 Then remove the hard drive from your old laptop.
Since your dealing with a lot of $$ and you dont know what your doing, go and buy a brand new laptop/computer.
If you have the ability you should wipe/reinstall windows and delete any applications you dont need ON THE NEW COMPUTER YOU JUST BOUGHT.
Dont use your new computer for anything except securing this bitcoin.
Even better if you can use linux (im assuming your not familiar) or install windows from scratch.
Download the bitcoin core wallet on your brand new computer. Dont get scammed only download from [bitcoin.org]( or the bitcoin github. Run bitcoin core until it is syncd with the blockchain.
Now plugin your old harddrive with the usb to sata converter you just bought and COPY the wallet.dat from your bitcoin core wallet on the old harddrive to your brand new computer and replace the empty wallet.dat that the bitcoin core wallet created with your old one.
You should now have your coins. You should make a new wallet and send your coins to that wallet, so you can claim all your forks like bch and stuff. Dont sweep or import private keys for forks until after you have moved your bitcoin to a new wallet you control.
The only real kinks you could run into is if you used bitlocker and dont have the recovery key in which case you will have to get your screen fixed and remember your old password.
The other one is if you used some other wallet, depending on what time you did this in 2011 I think the only real wallets available were bitcoin core or armory. If you used armory you probably wouldnt be posting this so ...
Good luck.
PS: Dont drop your harddrive.

If you know how to use it and have the ability to exchange it for its value then sure.
But thats the issue currently there are very few people who are comfortable working with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and in alot of countries the infrastructure to easily exchange it is either not available, or too complex for some grandma that can't use a cell phone.
This will change over time, just like when phones and email were invented.

There is a transaction fee.
It does not matter if its 1 sat or 1 bitcoin its still a fee you must pay in order to make a transaction.

That is the weekly.

Not really. Bitcoin has governance that decides what changes are included and which are not.
That governance is made up of all participants in the mining community and node operators.
True you can create as many copies of bitcoin as you want and change them however you would like, but then they are no longer bitcoin.
You have to get permission from the majority operators of the network to get your change included in bitcoin. Just because you may have a good idea does not mean that the majority will agree its a good idea.
Bitcoin has governance. Cryptocurrency does not.

I don't understand.
Programming is hard so invest $100 into ethereum for daytrading and youll be fine? Seriously?
@_date: 2019-12-11 21:53:34


That really threw me.  I understand what your trying to get across after re reading your comment.
I would have boiled it down to -
"Transaction fees are determined by current transaction volume."
Edit: Because alot of people don't know what a mempool is or how mining works, or how difficulty is adjusted etc.

You dont know enough about your investment to even verify its legitimacy.
You need to do alot, but to get started:
1. What is he using to convert the funds from bitcoin to (insert denomination here)? An Exchange? Localbitcoins? Himself?
2. Keep track of the daily open/close/average for the exchange/whatever that your third party liquidates bitcoin on.
3. Ask for reports. What are you paying this guy for?
4. Learn how to calculate the amount mined from your equipment yourself. ([Whattomine.com]( will help get you started.
5. Verify electricity costs against mining equipment.
If you do all of the above atleast youll have some idea of where your at.
It doesnt sound to me like your getting ripped off but what the hell do I know im just some guy on the internet.
Question: How are you going to do taxes next year if you cant even verify the numbers?
Edit: These are for yourself, please don't respond to this post or publicly answer any of these questions of course.
