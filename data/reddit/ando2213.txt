Thanks for the great info! Well it sounds like bitcoin is at least an improvement so far compared to the dollar system.

I still fail to see how Bitcoin is different from the dollar. Like you mentioned, at the rate it's going all I see is it going back to the same shitty system. Whether centralized or decentralized it really has no bearing. The wealthy play puppets with the government along with everything else so where does bitcoin break off away from that system.

I'm curious, what was your reason to choose Bitcoin?

The main point of my question was how is Bitcoin different than the dollar? Which I know is rhetorical based on what I know about bitcoin. I was hoping that someone would enlighten me with new information about how Bitcoin could be different from the dollar and it's system. Since the extremely wealthy play puppets with everything including governments and politics, how does bitcoin break off from this to be worthy of a new currency that's supposed to give everyone more freedom? Bitcoin has a blockchain, ok, that's great I guess but if people can still be anonymous on it, what's the diff. Bitcoin is digital, well my dollars for the most part are also digital, complete with digital credit and loan options. Bitcoin has a hash code for your wallet. Alright, hash codes have been protecting passwords and other sensitive data for a long time. Bitcoin is instant. Well if you pay a higher fee then yes otherwise some transactions could take days to complete. Bitcoin has digital wallets, so does the dollar, I can access bank account through apps and the web....
