How would the nodes know which blocks are legitimate? That's the whole problem proof-of-work is meant to solve. If you have a new sybil-proof consensus mechanism that will solve this, I'm all ears.

He's talking about nodes, not miners.

Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, so only you can use your public key because only you have the private key.

Yes, if you have 51% of the network, you decide which is the valid chain. This doesn't prevent 51% attacks, it just means you have to actually own the necessary hashrate, rather than own a pool controlling it. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 08:39:37
And many other superior-yet-underused standards.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:59:40
There are two different difficulties and target times. One for blocks, one for mini-pools. If someone controls &gt;50% of the block generation and tries to put out a fraudulent block, the mini-proof miners will reject it and keep mining the last good block. The network will go along with the chain with the highest total hashrate, not just highest block-generation hashrate.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:15:32
It's an attempt to get around the small block rewards leading to low hashrate and thus low security.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:59:26
They can't increase the block rate much beyond what it already is without an unacceptable proportion of orphaned shares.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:30:34
It does strengthen the blockchain, because total hashrate including mini-proofs is used to determine the valid branch. The only people creating blocks would be pools and big mining farms, but those blocks are still accepted or rejected by the rest of the network.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:37:48
I'll concede it's more likely than my initial assessment, then. Only time will tell whether it becomes the dominant nomenclature.
@_date: 2014-01-26 11:12:11
But that just increases the time between shares.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:00:21
The problem with p2pool is as it grows, the P2pool difficulty rises the same as the original blockchain difficulty. There's a reason that p2pool only has ~1% of the network: it takes days to find a share.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:04:32
The difference is that owning a pool is cheaper than owning the equivalent workers. If mini-shares are not mined in a pool, then no pool can capture 51% of the network.

What is their solution and is it decentralised?
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:10:48


@_date: 2014-01-25 22:37:12
Yes, a 51% attack is still totally possible if you have the hardware. The point is to prevent any conspiracy of pools from mounting a 51% attack, since more than 50% of all mining power will be working on mini-proofs, not in pools. Pools are a threat because they control hashing power that they don't own. If less than half the hashing power is in pools, the network is safer.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:27:37
Yes I have seen that, and it's not an ideal solution because it effectively destroys hashrate that would otherwise be used to secure the network. It's also an active effort to punish perceived "bad" pools, whereas pools could be eliminated as a threat altogether. 
Yes pools are currently necessary for the health of the network, but they have too much power over an originally decentralised system, and stripping them of the power to perform 51% attacks can only be a good thing.
You only get rewarded for contributing **by the network** if you publish a block. Pools smooth things out, but from the networks point of view, one massive operator found a block.

IPs are cheap. Ghash can more than afford to hire a server in panama to relay their traffic. Proof-of-work is the only thing that determines consensus, and if they have the majority, they control the consenus.

It's the scenario we're discussing, where the private keys are lost.
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:08:13
If I understand you right (two different currencies on one altchain/sidechain), then either the useful features of the sidechain/altchain are implemented in BTC, in which case the mining reward currency will have no value and so mining is back to being only barely rewarded, or they are implemented on the mining reward currency and the BTC/sidechain element of it is entirely superfluous, making it just an altcoin that is hampered by having to accomodate this other BTC pegged currency.

P2pool still uses a blockchain, it just contains no transactions and has shorter block times. Mini-proofs do not need to be chained, only collated, so there can be many more of them.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:57:32


They are not. They are acting against the pool, not for the network. I concede that it's a net benefit, but it still results in a lower net hashrate.


It's far too late by then. Someone (perhaps many people, multiple double spends can occur in one block) has been defrauded, and confidence in bitcoin is severely damaged.


I know. It's a drain on community resources and must be maintained indefinitely. Switching pools and withholding blocks are not passive, they are active, and must be targeted against particular pools. If the tools are automated, who then decides which pools should suffer the ire of the network?


I'm not purporting to solve everything, or even fully solve one thing. I'm just proposing a solution that removes the threat pools pose, rather than managing it (withholding, pool switching). The only real current partial solution is P2Pool, but that is crippled by the same problem: a blockchain can only be updated so fast.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:57:21
More complex to trace where they're going.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:02:15
Thank you. This is the sort of feedback I was looking for. Could a field indicating how many mini-proofs were attached be added to the block header, with blocks being rejected if this number is wrong?
EDIT: Okay, getblocktemplate seems like a good idea. How many pools/miners/mining software support it?
@_date: 2014-04-22 12:06:29
Not with pools.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:28:48
How? P2pool cannot solve this without changes to the underlying bitcoin protocol, since they need their blockchain-based model to participate in the network.

While zib is technically superior in every way, it lacks the tiny spark of familiarity that 'bit' has. That will be enough for bit to accumulate adherents faster than zib, and then the network effect of these sorts of things kicks in, where the disadvantages are clear, but no-one wants to be the first to switch.
And I'll still use it. I still use a Dvorak keyboard, after all.

* Destroying hashrate lowers the overall security of the network, making it easier for other entities to get 51%
* Pools are a figurehead which control the work their miners do. All they have to do is send out a fraudulent double-spend block to the miners and have it hashed.
* All of the existing solutions that could be implemented require constant vigilance to ensure no pool gets too big. People need to constantly switch pools or actively attack them depending on relative hashrate, and most people won't bother.
* I'm not proposing that everyone shut up and implement my idea right now or the world will end, I'm just putting it out there as a potential solution to the Pool Problem


Read. This. Sentence. The **network** rewards you if you publish a block. The **pool** rewards you if you give it a share. You are not contradicting me.

They still need to be held as a record that the work was done and the rewards can be claimed.

It's still more capacity. Even if only one is connected to at a time by one client, they will all see use.
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:52:11
That is exactly the issue. With no mining rewards, there would be very little hashpower behind it, leaving it vulnerable to a 51% attack.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:11:50
It is a similar solution to the problem, but it still has proof-of-work tied to a block, so it can't go above about 1 proof of work per second. That would still require pools for all but large miners.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:38:06
P2Pool currently has about 1% of network hashrate, so it will find a block about every day. Splitting it into more P2Pools will just increase this figure.
In my proposal, mini-proofs cannot be orphaned, since they are not mined on, the blocks are mined on. Mini-proofs are valid if they are included in a block, any block, provided they are below the current target.
@_date: 2014-01-03 11:40:40
There's nothing wrong with ending a sentence with a preposition. Along with not splitting infinitives, it was part of an aborted attempt to make english more like latin, which it clearly is not.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:10:18
The list of what transactions were being included is the previous block hash, which is what the mini-proofs are mined off. P2pool is working to construct and verify a block, so it needs the blockchain model to ensure everyone is playing fair.
@_date: 2014-01-25 23:09:26
That's a good point.
I'll have to think on that.

Proof of work decides whether they spread it, because they have no other way of knowing which is the valid chain.
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:56:25
"How much work was put in" is established by difficulty, which is the same for two weeks at a time. So since every found block proves the same amount of work, it boils down to who has more blocks.

It's devs who need to see this more than the people running the machines.
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:13:08
If a pool uses it's power to publish bad blocks (forks, double spends, etc), the mini-proof miners will not accept it and will keep mining on the last good block.
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:11:14
The sidechain concept uses merged mining, so a 51% attack on bitcoin would be a 51% attack on them. It would even be easier, because not everyone will merge-mine, especially since there won't be any block rewards for sidechain mining, only transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:15:20
That's not right at all.


@_date: 2014-01-25 17:20:47
I am talking about the actual bitcoin blockchain. You would be trying to find a hash below a target of something containing the hash of the last actual block. You don't need to create more blocks.
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:35:20
And the chain with the most proof-of-work would be the oldest one. A 'bad block' would be an attempt to go back and fork the blockchain to double spend. This requires getting the network to accept your block, despite the other block being older. Since block-making is not the only proof of work, you would have to control most mining, not just most block making mining, to put more proof of work on your fraudulent chain.

Unspent outputs are quantum safe. There's no quantum algorithm we know of that can break hash algorithms. This is one of the reasons why address reuse is discouraged, since the first time you spend from an address, you reveal the ECDSA public key, which is not quantum safe.

It's just the reality of the situation. USDT have a value that floats on the market, just like every other crypto. Tether inc keeps that value close to $1 by exchanging them for dollars (in theory). If they go away, USDT has no reason to stay a dollar and will rapidly go to $0.00 in a mass panic.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:28:39
In theory 100% backed by USD, but we all know how likely that is.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:54:50
You'd still have the same amount of USDT, they would just be worth less. Or worthless, if there's really nothing backing them.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:06:41
Tether doesn't currently give you USD for USDT unless you're looking to move millions (and then they likely just match you with someone looking to buy instead of giving you money directly, since you know, no banking right now).
The other exchanges have nothing to do with the USD&lt;-&gt;USD flows, they just accept deposits, trades, and withdrawals like for any other cryptocurrency. Kraken is I think the only exchange that does [direct USDUSDT trading]( so if you want USD for your USDT you can go there and eat the premium. Obviously, if everyone suddenly wants out, no one is buying and that price will crash.
Thus far, the number of tether in circulation has only gone up. In theory bitfinex could have just been issuing more than they're redeeming, but in reality it's likely they're doing no redeeming and large institutional partners who want out of tether just sell them OTC, again at less than a dollar.
The real test comes when the crypto market stalls and more people want out of tether than in. Will bitfinex find a way to redeem them en mass? Or are they running a fractional reserve, to be discovered when a giant bank run crashes the price? None of the promised audits have materialised and we have no proof of their holdings, so really we have no reason to believe they haven't just been printing money.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:27:46
In theory the only effect a tether collapse should have would be by sentiment; every crypto crisis makes the popular conception of the sphere a little worse. In an efficient market, only those holding USDT would suffer losses. In reality, crypto markets move on sentiment, so they would likely fall but not catastrophically. Even if bitfinex totally goxxes, the market is more decentralised now, with more exchanges in more countries and currencies, so it probably won't be as bad as 2014. And anyone who's just holding need only wait for the price to recover.
