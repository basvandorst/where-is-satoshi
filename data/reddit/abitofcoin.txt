It is just a way for people running 'exchanges' to profit off of inexperienced 'investors'... i put exchanges in quotes because currently you cannot get cash for your bitcoin on the largest bitcoin exchange out there, and investors in quotes because the majority of people buying bitcoin have never had any experience investing before.
An intelligent investor would not touch this with a ten foot pole. Stay tuned because the price will plunge once Mt.Gox's fraud is revealed.
Edit: it is already happening as I type this... dropped from 150 to 120 which represents a 20% decline in a matter of minutes.
Edit 2: 30 seconds later it drops another 3%

proof? 
let me guess you will provide it soon-ish?

Technically, you don't because they don't have any coins.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:09:58
In a word, yes.

Well-written article. Nice to see some real analysts perspectives instead of hivemind speculation for once.

bro be serious. The market value is just made up. 
Think of it like Beanie Babies. Back in the day I couldn't buy an elephant beanie baby for under a few hundred bucks. Now they aren't worth the material they are made of. Since bitcoin is made of nothing, it is worth exactly the material it is made of ($0)

Better to get out alive?

Kind of cruel to send them something that will be valueless in a few months. Best to send cash.

What could possibly happen between now and Mt. Gox's ultimate demise to bring the price up from its current mark?

I am sorry you feel this way. Just know it will get better. Cut your losses on these 'currencies' and invest in some more reliable things. I feel you bro.

Luckily I was just watching from the sidelines. I feel for anyone who put a dime into this fad, though. :/
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:33:12
Such a shame. It was inevitable though.

Thank you shibe. This is the same attitude that moved me to dogecoin in the first place. &lt;3
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:49:06
BITCOIN IS TROLLING! lol
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:33:43
Just trying to relate it for people who have never invested in anything before (90% of bitcoiners).

I have moved to dogecoin.
The community is much better over there.

How can I buy candles without bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:49:21
Surely it is good news.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:00:50
did you buy some after they stopped withdrawals? At what price?
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:46:48
I am buying at $25
