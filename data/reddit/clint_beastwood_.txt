Woah, who the hell gets paid in increments of 30BTC at a time?

That seems slightly insulting...

LoL, that sounds pretty absurd. The Snowden leaks has brought the NSA surveillance activities to center stage of national scrutiny, their constitutionality is in question, the American people are angry, legislators are pissed because they learned that they were being spied on and right now there are laws being drafted up that could neuter the NSA's capabilities... and also it has greatly strained our relations with many of our allies and has exposed many of their sensitive techniques... So unless you know something very significant that you are keeping to yourself I'd say you are just blowing steam &amp; ignoring a mountain of evidence that should logically suggest otherwise.

'You can trace where a bitcoin comes from' This *is* true, you can trace every transaction on the block chain. Who the fuck is this Idi-I-Smotri guy? He sounds like a complete asshat, I have watch over 6 hours of the Bitcoin hearing and NY regulators have sounded cautious but positively optimistic.

My grandfather, aunts &amp; uncles were in the military and I still managed to get it so I think you should be fine. I wanna say my first account was a joint savings/checking with my Mom. Then I had it modified so I had full control. I don't think I'm eligible for their insurance but I haven't tried to get it either.

Edit: "In layman's terms, the bitcoin network allows for a user to send digital information securely and irrevocably to another person, no prior trust or 3rd parties needed, with everyone else on the network also agreeing that the transaction has taken place."

Regarding the fed I like [this]( explanatory video from Chris Martenson. He doesnt exactly cover this question but he does tackle some of the most compelling economic indicators &amp; upcoming challenges in a purely statistical, no tin foil hat perspective- or at least that is what it seems like. Anyone else have an opinion on this guy?

First time I bought something was a few months ago, I was hammered drunk and still managed to create a blockchain.info wallet, transfer funds from coinbase and buy a gaming mouse off tiger direct. It was a good experience. I think once Bitcoin gets some more ease of use built into the interactions it will really highlight it's convenience as a payment method.

I baaaarely understand economics but I have always understood that Bitcoin's volatility is due to it's undeveloped market share, this notion has been almost intuitive- IMO this is on the most basic level of conceptualizing markets...  So I don't see how so many prominent economists act like it is some ominous, glaring fault.  And frankly I would bet all of my BTC that if we DID have a central authority increasing supply whenever the price bubbled we would have a completely different bottom right now- a much, much lower bottom. Since all the Fed can do is *increase* supply in times of runaway price- they would have done their magic in Nov/Jan but would not have been able to predict the MtGox clusterfuck or China's regulatory issues and when the market retracted the price would fall ever-faster. Their meddling is not fool proof and in that regard IMO the organic price movements make more sense for the longevity of Bitcoin.

You two are fucking stupid. And by the way bitcoin isn't just a currency it is an eloquent solution to the difficult problem of decentralized control and collective understanding. No matter how many times you say it, this is certainly *NOT* the end of bitcoin, trolls. And even IF Bitcoin did end it's solution would continue because it is revolutionary.

? So what is the actual mechanism taking place then? I know that the Federal reserve central bank effectively lends the United States money by buying bonds.. so then what is the mechanism for returning the interest payments? After receiving the payments the Fed just turns around and issues them a check? Doesn't sound right to me.

Any positive results for him? I would be pretty nervous about this approach if I needed any kind of steady cash flow to subsist.  
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:22:45
Its all about ease of use and mimicking a payment routine that everyone- the layman or even gramps &amp; granny are already familiar with. Bitcoin is about innovation-not imitation, no doubt, but if the payment process is easy enough that it required no extra thought then all will stand out will be the advantages it holds over traditional methods, then Bitcoin will be a no-brainer.  
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:32:29
I think this also allows cops to seize large amounts of cash if they were to find it on you- like if you had $50k sitting in your car's back seat when you get pulled over, I think they can just take it on reasonable suspicion. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:14:10
Agreed, I think Bitcoin will truly become mainstream when it breaks this  "ease of use" barrier- When paying with Bitcoin is just as easy as the two-step process of paying with a CC then all things will be equal and Bitcoin's superiority will be truly undeniable. Then Bitcoin adoption will be a no-brainer, even for the layman.

I would think that price movement must be largely dependent on news about GoxCoins, right? If they are permanently lost/inaccessible then price should rise given that there are fewer in existence... If they were stolen then so price should fall or stay the same given the chance that they could be dumped on the market. Likewise if they are determined to be accessible &amp; refundable then price should ultimately fall or stay the same... Right? I kinda figured the reason why price didn't go batshit crazy when "news" broke that Gox was likely to be insolvent is that for the most part the fate of the 750,000 coins is still unknown. I guess I am looking at this from a rather narrow supply/demand perspective, is this smart approach or misguided?

Damn I think you are right about that. I have been trying to review prices &amp; transaction but Coinbase doesn't really provide an easy way to do that... Chalk this up to a first time buyer's learning experience I guess.

Thanks for the input!
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:21:04
Who says you cant do both simultaneously? It was just a bittersweet experience for me so out of frustration I scrutinized the transaction and it appears to be wrong. If that is the case then their exchange just got really sketchy IMO and i'd be damned if I do any more trades with them.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:00:26
I disagree with your first point. I think being able to use it *conveniently* as a payment method is crucial to its legitimacy, price stability and long term store of value. Bitcoin has undeniable utility and its growth potential as a world-wide currency seems limitless... but if you take that away and constrain it to being strictly a commodity I would see it waging a constant battle to remain legitimate. Besides its unique utility there is very little that actually validates its existence as a commodity. Peter Schiff makes this point very well and I would urge other Bitcoin enthusiasts to pay attention to similar cautionary perspectives. Yes there is "work" and expense required to create it but that does not give it true intrinsic value. Schiff would say that gold on the other hand has intrinsic value because it has stood the test of time; it is attractive to people, whether you have it today, a few hundred years ago or fifty years in the future it will still have some value and people will still want it. Bitcoin's does not have that, its attractiveness is closely tied to its utility. I think speculators recognize this as well and see the difference in potential market caps between the two, currency-commodity. I don't see it taking off in the way everyone is hoping if it is only going to be a commodity.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:20:30
Some people truly believe in the utility of bitcoin and its superiority over mainstream currencies. Soooo we would be more than happy to see a big dip so we can buy in again. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:26:44
I think you make a good cautionary point here. A lot of people seem to view BTC's anonymous P2P structure as making it infallible to government control but BTC is still vulnerable at the front-end exchange level. If people can't access it easily or in this case exchange it for a domestic dollar it could really derail the adoption potential of crypto currencies. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:53:06
That's what I thought too! cost me nice chunk, roughly +- $210 at today's price!
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:18:18
No, I don't think my math is off- My point was by their own website today's market value was hovering around $760 but the price of my purchase was $780. I was wondering if there was some hidden cost that was not being accounted for, or if other coinbase customers have experienced anything similar?
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:57:23
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY! Lol I was hoping for a crash.... but hopefully not too low. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:51:36
Hmm I don't think it was but after looking into it I have seen similar comments about that policy being in effect as of a few days before I bought it. I must confess I was multi-tasking at work when I made the purchase so maybe I missed it.
