I thought that too at first, but then why not connect to each other over a private network to sync and vary the public nodes each VPS connects to? This would be way faster, catch more fresh transactions, and save bandwidth costs.
Unless they're all unrelated to each other, which I find possible but unlikely, the only explaination I can think of is they're stupidly/lazily configured or malicious.

Unbanked people do not use Bitcoin. White male firstworlders use Bitcoin. You have a fucking quarter. Don't give me this unbanked shit.
You have been spoiled by absurdly low fees. Miners won't mine for free, and by the time the block reward is eliminated, fees will have to be in the double digit btc per block or they will just walk away.
If tx volume JUSTIFIES/NECESSITATES increased block sizes, they will be increased. Right now, tx volume does not justify this. Right now, you pay a quarter out of your unbanked ass or you just wait 2 days.
When the mempool is chasing 300MB, we can have a serious discussion. Until then pay the 25 cents or stfu.

"Don't support" and "will refuse to implement" are wildly different standards.
They might not prefer it, but the costs of supporting both chains are FAR less then the potential cost of supporting the losing chain.
Not implementing both chains, when all that would take is a day of coding, and the consequences of supporting only the losing chain are bankrupcy, such a choice would be pretty fucking negligent bruv.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:02:42

If the chains split, any SegWit capable wallet will be able to transact on both chains.
*HOWEVER*, if the BIP148 chain starts winning and you want to make sure your transactions go *ONLY* on the BIP148 chain and not the legacy chain, you will need send such transactions from a BIP148 node.

There could be 99.9% BIP148 nodes, but if they're all owned by 1 guy and are personally transacting an insignificant amount of BTC, then it doesn't matter.
I could makeup BIP666 today and spin up 9,000 VPS nodes that only support BIP666, but unless people say "Only BIP666 nodes can process my transactions" and then send a significant amount of BTC using such transactions, then I'm just some lone weirdo with a big hosting bill and a pointless fork that is completely ignored by the rest of the network.

He is out there advocating while you conspiracy theory on Reddit. Think whatever you want, that's your right, but don't discount everything he has done for Bitcoin generally just because you have a different view on the optimal blocksize.
