Inflation is necessary. People will hoard and not spend without it. The problem with inflation is when it's at a runaway pace, usually do to corruption or super gross government negligence.

Oh but they do hoard. That's why the gold standard had to be removed. You're more likely to purchase sooner than later if you know that your money will be worth less as time goes by.
I would recommend researching how inflation and interest rates affect the economy.
By the way, bitcoin provides excellent evidence on hoarding "hodling".

Yes I think it's okay to encourage spending, it's far from forcing as you say, because when someone spends a dollar it means that someone earns a dollar. If people were to gain more spending power by simply not spending then people wouldn't spend. As I pointed out earlier just look at hodling. When the Fed sees things heating up they raise interest rates in order to slow spending down and when the economy needs a jolt they lower interest rates. Also, we have ever expanding markets. We actually have a really great system here in the US, you just have to take some time to understand how it works and why it was setup the way that it is.

yep. Noobs don't understand that their fears will make them lose money and their bitcoins.

There are plenty of things you could do. You can sell anything that you don't really need or use. You can ask some family members if they can pay you right now for some work you will do for them in the next few months like yard work and stuff. You can go on YouTube and look up fast ways to make some fast cash. Keep in mind that it can very well be that any jobs that you do are actually paying you much more in the future since you'd be putting it into an investment.

I wonder if it's bottle necked due to buying limits under 10K at Coinbase.  I don't know.
