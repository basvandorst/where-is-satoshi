It's even simpler than that: Bitcoin is coded that way.
Short term you could pick whatever reason to explain everything. Longterm it is part of the protocol.

You could create a public key and post it onto the blockchain. Then you go to the institution that will hold the election and apply for a vote. They make sure you are allowed to vote based on their laws and the sign your key. On voting day you can then with a zero knowledge proof show that you have a key signed for this election, without revealing the public key, and use your vote.
The point here is that you can not have one vote for every human, without someone to check if you are human. So you can choose to have a central authority to check it - and since you don't want to rely on someone who has nothing to do with the voting, the most logical authority is the institution doing the voting (e.g. your government).
The alternative would be to approximate identities. "That ID belongs to a human with a probability of 73% therefore the vote is valued 0.73"
That would be no good for elections in a political system, but enough for reddit, or an altcoin that wants to include a basic income.

I recommend building gardens. There is nothing worse for a place like this as when there is noting to work for.

It is better for Bitcoin when there is no lobbying.

Bitcoin is made for hoarding.
The use of money is 1. A means of exchange and 2. A store of value. Bitcoin is designed to be good a the second point. Dogecoin is better at the first. This is not a bad thing at all. It breaks the classic concept of one currency for everything. You just use one currency for each task. Unix said: Do one thing and do it well. Bitcoin is doing well on being a store of value in contrary of credit-money that has an intended inflation of about 2 percent.

It's just that I explode every time I have to work with a sketchup file. So better for my health.

Thank you! I just downloaded Mohammed Rafighs Beyond Matter for 0.002 BTC.

There is no reason.
Ever since bitcoin was created the price is going it's way, independent from the outer world. It's like Z=Z²+C.
There is no - external - reason.

Pay for downloads, the simple way.
Like: "Send the amount to *this* address, wait for confirmation and past your txid *here*. Thank you, your *download* is ready."
Would be amazing for marketing music and books and games.
If that is to easy then include some escrow service.

Google search results are personalized. They give you a phishing site because the algorithm thinks you want it.
If you want a deterministic search result that is the same for everyone use DuckDuckGo or Startpage.

To all architects: Please stop using sketchup. Now.
(Autocad and Revit are illegal too.)

I'm pretty sure you did this intentional to prevent people sending bitcoins to that address.

It is always easy to make laws. But just having a law does not do anything. They only "work" when there is someone to execute it. If you call for regulation, you call for the police.
If you really want to fix a problem you have to think longer and deeper, collect hundred ideas and ignore every one that involves the government.
As well as the state can make naked shorting illegal, they can make bitcoin illegal. You do not want to depend on those peoples mood.

In an essay ([pdf]( David Greaber describes some anarchist societies and how they deal with emerging hierarchies. (Most free software project are essentially a social group without hierarchy that manages it's issues by self-organizing and consensus. So the term "anarchy" can apply here.) It is that those social groups always have strong visions of what is evil. They fight ghost and which craft all their lives in order to maintain their social order. And anything that goes slightly in the direction of an emerging hierarchy gets branded as the outcome of evil. So being passionate about decentralization/consensus/preventing 51% is a common reaction if something threatens the non-hierarchic way bitcoin is organized.

I'm just to lazy to write an elaborated answer. The thing is that bitcoins deflationary character is a problem when you want it to be a means of exchange. However, it is very good as a store of value.
What we want, and what we expect to happen is more user adoption within time. Also we can predict the amount of bitcoins in the future. Together with the above criteria we encounter a paradox. When bitcoins behave deflationary, people tend not to spend them, when you don't spend them then it is not a currency, and when it is not a currency the value would drop. But that would cause it to become inflationary. We have two competing forces here, but we assume that deflation will win in the end.
In reality there are no paradoxes. Therefore there must be something that combines both those trends. This is in fact what we see with the so called "bubbles". The interesting part however is not the spice, but the following slow decline. This is the time people spend their bitcoins and use it as a currency. Then the opposite happens, store-of-value slowly takes over and leads to an exponential growth that will lead to another "bubble", and so on. This is a behavior that is inherent to Bitcoin and independent from almost all outside influence.
With this repetition in mind we can look at the price history and estimate when the upwards trend comes back. This is now. In the next week(s) the price will drop again a little bit. But in general the next time it will mostly be stable, until it slowly starts to rise again.

It is interesting to see that many people mention Freicoin as an example, while Freicoin itself is more or less done now. I'd love to see more altcoins with demurrage.
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:10:31
I think one critical part of a currency with demurrage is the initial distribution. People won't buy them unless they need some. So there should be some system that gives it to people for free. One could be merged mining, where the coin would just be an additional reward for the miners. Another is an unconditional basic income. But for this you need some sort of bureaucracy/a state managing it. Greece could be the example.

Rule of thumb: Don't link anything by the Axel Springer Verlag. It's not worth reading.
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:15:10
That's the very idea behind this. You use it as a means of exchange instad of a store of value.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:58:16
This would be awesome:
* Mergemined with Bitcoin
* An annual demurrage ("holding tax") somewhat between 5% and 15%
* Pay that demurrage to the people as an unconditioinal basic income.
