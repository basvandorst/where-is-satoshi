Right from the official whitepaper - "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"  It's intended use was as a currency.  It's become more of an investment because "lambo" and "moon" but that certainly was not the original intent.
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:16:10
well said
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:38:20
Good, who cares.  Bitcoin wasn't meant to be an "investment", it was meant to be a currency.

What do you mean "it was sent from an imported address"??  When someone is going to send you bitcoin, the first thing you do is send that person your bitcoin receive address, and then you say "Ok buddy, that's my address, send the funds there".

So...  James Bilal Khalid Caan claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto himself yet..  "I had lost my original emails because my email accounts were hacked, I had lost my 980,000 bitcoins because of the hard drive crashing, and I had no digital signature because I never planned to reveal myself."
Well how fucking convenient that all these things happened.  So basically he's saying" I'm Satoshi, but unfortunately I've lost every piece of evidence to prove that I'm Satoshi so you'll just have to take my word for it" Oh, and now you're gonna shill some new shitcoin called Tabula Rasa.

This negative news 'should' have caused a dip in bitcoin's price.  Instead it's basically been hovering around $4,000 for the last few days.  It's almost like the whole cryptocurrency market is like "fuck you, I'll move when my balls itch, not when you print some sissy article".  As always, there's just no rhyme or reason to what causes any movement.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:05:27
Those are all excellent suggestions.  I would also add to create a separate bank account to link to your coinbase account and only use it for your crypto activities.  So that way if Coinbase tries any shenanigans (locking your funds, double charging you etc.), the 'damage' will be minimal
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:16:03
And if I cash it out at a Bitcoin ATM?  I guess the atm machine will just nickel and dime me with fees, eh? Or if I never cash out and just make all my purchases in bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-05-21 20:14:56
they probably just misunderstood the question.  kinda like that old joke / riddle "what's heavier, a pound of gold or a pound of feathers?"   They probably just assumed one BTC was equivalent to one dollar.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:14:15
I don't understand your reasoning.  Pulling your bitcoins out of the exchange does not make you any wealthier.  You're literally just moving it from your left pocket to your right pocket, nothing is gained financially.  Nobody is saying to cash out your btc, just to transfer them off of the exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:30:16
I just checked out the website of the Spedn app that this article talks about.  It mentions that you have to provide the app with your full name, date of birth, state of residence???   This is not the essence of how Bitcoin is meant to be used.  This is a KYC / AML solution.

yea but what if I buy from Gemini, transfer to an external wallet, run that shit through a mixer / coinjoin etc.  then some years later send it to a different exchange (Coinbase) to cash out.  How the hell will the IRS charge me for that?  It's essentially "not the same Bitcoin".  How will they calculate if I made any capital gains?
@_date: 2018-12-24 20:53:34
One thing I've learned throughout life is: Old people and new technology generally don't mix well.  But to be fair, old people have probably seen tons of 'promising new tech" that has ended up fading into obscurity so you can understand them being a bit jaded.  Besides, I would imagine the older you are, the more "set in your ways" that you are.  You probably don't have the energy to learn some complicated new technology when the one you've been using for decades works perfectly fine.
