I think you need to re-evaluate your definition of great. 
The fact that you need to scan(!) QR code(!!) with phone(!!!) from computer monitor(!!!!) is not great. 
It's ridiculous, retarded, moronic, stupid, dumb as fuck and inconvenient. It's direct opposite from great. 
You know what would be great? Simply clicking on one fucking link (there are already half dozens of proposals for that). 
Or at least copy-paste one single string that contains address and sum   into the wallet application. But no, that's not masochistic enough. 


Once everything set up I literally need to click once to pay with a card(1-click buying on amazon). That's what I call great.

This is ridiculous and unacceptable. 
As consumer I will tell you to fuck off if you'll offer me to wait even a single confirmation. When I'm buying computers, neither me, nor my money want to wait. And we will not. 
We would rather go to a place where I can just hand out bank card, put signature, grab PC parts and go home. If bitcoin can't achieve the same speed and convenience as credit/debit card, I don't see a reason to use it.

Not THAT expensive. It's forum, not SAP deployment.

Let me translate you what word "potential" mean:
"We will let you run for a while, but then we'll catch you and hang you by your balls when we want, and we'll tell you that you are  an evil Pinocchio to yourself as we warned you".
Remember the strictness of Russian law is compensated for by the laxity of its enforcement.


I think it's pretty clear that Russia is against anonymous money transfer. They even have law, that they passed just this year.

I used bitcoins once to buy game Factorio. I really didn't like the process so I didn't purchase anything since then. It might change with that new promised update where I'll have simply to click a link in a browser and then just confirm the purchase.

Artists and designers get this all the time from what I heard.

I wish there was a question about stocks. Most of my coins(&gt;90%) are not in wallet.

From my POV using them is far less risky than using AML/KYC complaint exchange.
I don't hold money there, so if they decide to run away/get hacked when I have money there, I'll lose no more than $10-300. More likely I'll lose $0.
Now let's take Kraken. If I'll provide all ID information and they'll get hacked, I'm fucked even if I don't have money there.  And we are not talking about $300 fucked. We are talking about thousands in dollars and weeks in time when I'll be running like a rat on fire to banks, courts, collection agencies trying to prove that it was no me who opened this and that credit and it's ok to stop harassing me. 
This risk just not worth it. I really, really like to sleep well, knowing that I don't have to worry that my ID was stolen from some site.

I don't understand why you confuse non-anonymity with insurance.
What exchange has insurance? Name one. 
And I am talking about ACTUAL insurance and not useless fantasy "they are not anonymous, so it'll be fine".
Take any Russian bank for example. If it will be shut down, I will get my money back(up to 700 000 RUB) because of the insurance. I know it because I saw plenty of examples: banks were gone, but money were returned to people after a while.
Name me exchange which is insured.

Changetip doesn't use transaction fees? Because when tips are comparable with fees, that's not exactly free.
I think tipping unit must be changed from `1 bit` to `1% of tx fee`. So people know when they actually can get funds.

Not if developer was the one who put them in the first place.
Also I'm not aware how often people check checksums. Probably not often.

Look how how they validate 
[user passwords](  `/[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,30}/` (letters or digits only, from 3 to 30 characters)
That's worse than [phpBB]( where I can actually make password `ab df%~fg`
That's worse than phpBB where I can't actually make password `123`
That's not $25k/month quality.

Same here. That's exactly why I'd rather use btc-e or any other site that doesn't require verification. I always felt that sending scans of passport et al. over the Internet is as stupid as publishing it on imgur. So if this leak doesn't lie, then mtgox proves why.
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:43:00
It's worse. It's like funding writers per word including each and every draft.

Don't mine bitcoins. Mining and selling altcoins is more profitable.
Don't gamble with retirement money, especially if they are not yours.

Even more. That applies only if you compile from code. 
If you downloaded binary then heaven knows what's inside.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:37:58
I agree. This idea 


(1) Free users don't  bring any money
(2) Bandwidth must come from somewhere.
Ergo! Cap these freeloaders so they can't download anything faster than 4 kb/sec. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:18:15


What? This doesn't make any sense.  Why the fuck would they make payment system that 
a) they can't control 
b) allows anonymous payments? 


Not even a chance. Not a single one. It is not possible. At all. Say what you want about Russian government, but they are not bitcoin brainwashed.

Because it's accepted in more places than I can care. 
Because if I have $20 in paypal account at Friday, I can spend $20 next Monday. 
If I have $20 worth of BTC at Friday, I'll be happy to have $15 worth of BTC at Monday.

For this reason I would use debit or even credit card: not a such ripoff.

Naturally, in 2004 it didn't exist. It's expected that it went up from then.
Consider this year [trend]( It's doormat since march with one significant jump up and even more significant jump down before that.

Yeah, they don't claim it's safe. They claim it's the safest.


For comparison, [seL4]( can run on common hardware(x86, ARM) and it's proven that it's implemented correctly.

I'm "good" at this.
Book value [bought for] = ฿2.3142   
Market value [can sell for] = ฿0.2910
Though if we convert it into USD, I think  I even have a profit.

Guess who made the post "Okay, Bitcoin stopped growing exponentially, now I think it is growing factorially (x!) ;)" [month ago](

Neither applies to just-dice. Bitcoins are limited and even if they were not

Technically he has higher chance to with with &lt;33  than &gt;66, check their "Fair?" section: 


[I'm not sure why Just-Dice uses this instead of X/4096 * 100 which has better distribution]
