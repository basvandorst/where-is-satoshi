That seems to contradict with your theory then. Chinese New Year was Jan 28th last year, which is half a month earlier yet the drop is happening on the same day?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:28:04
No, the ordinary citizen is not going to be mining bitcoins. It's going to be concentrated in businesses, which are probably not going selling them for Chinese New Year.
So, while the majority of the mining may occur in China, not many Chinese people would actually be doing it.

It’s kind of hilarious that you have no idea who is the chairman but at the same time just know that they’re terrible.

$2 bills are really rare as well, yet they're worth $2. Same goes for collectors' coins or those pennies from 19XX
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:05:40
No that’s only in terms of something this risky. You can and should invest in, says, your 401k more than you are willing to lose
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:57:41
Sadly you have no counter argument :(
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:21:25
You want people to spend or invest their USD. If everyone just hoards their USD because the value increases each year, you wind up in a recession.
*Investments* should increase in value over time. Yes, the USD alone is a terrible investment but, luckily, no sane person is going to invest in USD. That's not what it is for.

You don't think that the more outlandish statement is that the majority of Chinese people own bitcoin? Even when most cannot afford even one? You are dirt poor if you live in these rural cities. That's why there are cheaper utilities.
I have family all over China. Almost none of the normal people are investing in bitcoin. It's all about real estate now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:32:59
He's talking about the general populace. I doubt many that are selling are seeing decentralization as utility they care about.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:00:29
I mean this is just some mental gymnastics to make you feel like you haven’t lost any money. If you bought in at 19k, that’s 50% of your spending power gone

*Voluntary* participation means that people can back out of the system at any time, thus making the system worthless. The U.S. being back, in part, through violent means adds stability, although arguably not in the most appealing way.

Look at the first graph. England went off the gold standard in the 30s. When does GDP (even adjusted for inflation) begin to skyrocket? And to answer this question:


Pretty much every single country in the entire world would accept a US dollar. You just go to a currency exchange instead of a gold exchange and currency exchanges are much, much easier to find.


Trump has no direct power over the number of bills to print. Period. His wall needs to be approved by Congress.
The truth is that, despite what you may believe, everyone else is not a dumbass.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:58:52
All currency is "monopoly money". Bitcoin, by itself, is worthless. The fact that other people value it is what makes it have value.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:04:36


That's like saying that I shouldn't trust the U.S. at all because who knows if the government randomly decides to nuke itself? It could happen any day now!
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:55:16
I'm so glad I found this thread because I find it hilarious. You do realize that you are assuming that there is a large number of Chinese people with Bitcoin. On top of that, you're assuming that these people who are investing in Bitcoin are willing to sell it off in a significant amount.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:04:49
You don't need to buy luxuries with it. You can use that money to invest. Why do you think people invest in Bitcoin so much? Because cash is inflationary, thus not something smart to hold large amounts in for a long time.
Inflation is a good thing because it promotes investing and spending, which is good for the economy. If nobody buys or invests, you have economic stagnation.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:38:44
That makes no sense. Bitcoin isn't even a U.S. product. You can't boycott U.S. bitcoins. Driving down the price of bitcoin doesn't hurt the U.S. government in any way, shape, or form.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:24:28
That's a very big assumption you are making.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:21:30
That sounds fine to me. It's not really that expensive to test these things out and even a tiny decrease in cost or increase in efficiency would mean massive profits because of how much traffic they have.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:08:25


No it's not. That's why pretty much every investor will tell you that it's stupid to sit on large amounts of cash. Currency has always been a way to exchange value with other people. That's what it's intended for.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:18:05
They’re not literally laughing at you. I doubt that they care very much about you personally to be honest. They maybe care about people with a ton of bitcoins who can actually affect the market. Knowing how bitcoin works isn’t worth anything now and probably not in the future unless you work in that area.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:51:11
You have no idea if a slight increase is going to result in a permanent upward trend or just another bump along the way down. You cannot predict the future.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:27:48
Aren’t you just ranting? Good for you that you did research into your investment. I just don’t see what that has to do with bankers
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:44:11
He’s implying that bitcoin will drop below $1000
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:24:37
I think you are missing the point of his example. Let's say that everyone values the banana at $1. The market cap (or basket) is thus worth $10. Someone then really likes bananas and buys one at $3. Now, the basket is worth $30. However, he is stating that there's no "depth" because nobody else would buy a banana for $3.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:44:36
It literally shifts from one extreme to another depending on which date range you choose.

11 days ago you said the bear market was over lol
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:05:54


I don't think you do. Can you carefully explain then? 
Deflationary currency only makes money into another investment. Rich people are better taking advantage of investments better than poor people. Rich people can save more currency than the poor.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:14:01
I don’t understand this. Bitcoin dropped over 20% but apparently it’s going to be our savior because the s&amp;p dropped not even half of that over several days
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:10:27
The number is just an example. He could easily be using something like $3
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:40:43
It's actually the exact same, just in a different direction.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:14:27
You talk like a big shot and look down at middle class Americans but, in your post history, you say that you live on $60 per day. That’s a bit shy of $22,000 a year, which actually makes you below a middle-class American. If you’re in the Caribbean, there’s a good chance you’re just living a frugal existence there. It sounds like you are using these millionaires you know (maybes you’re a tour guide or something. Idk) to make yourself feel better.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:03:45
What are you even talking about? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:07:18
You do realize that, just because it doesn't fall to zero, doesn't mean that it's guaranteed to climb back to a good price.
Open up any bitcoin price chart and zoom out. Does recent activity look *that* different from what's been happening since the all time high? You have no idea what's going to happen.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:28:24


lol. I know what you're trying to say but this typo(?) is hilarious.


If you don't play, you're not going to become poor unless you are already poor. If you are already poor, you can't really play, anyways.

There currently isn't even 1 quadrillion USD worth of money in the entire world. This seems extremely unlikely.

Holding has no effect on demand. It’s limiting supply. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:30:40
That's assuming that price is directly correlated with adoption.

This has to be a troll account. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:16:39
Yes, and that 31% is difficult because most are spread out in rural areas with many of those areas having subpar internet. You'd need to build up the infrastructure, which is extremely expensive.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:54:37
Did you forgot how Bitcoin got to $6000? It dropped that much in 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:21:08
There is no price if there’s no transaction. Price is determined by markets. It’s not some magical attribute of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:59:05
No, I'm saying that, if you want to 100% swap from fiat to Bitcoin, you need to distribute wallets for people to hold their money as well as a means to transact.
Maybe this would be much easier in the future but it's tough now because not everybody lives a middle to upper middle class lifestyle in a populated area. A good size of the population don't even have access to decent internet. Building that, obviously, has environmental impact.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:48:33
You weren’t lying about this being wild
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:44:02
No, because you are not including the cost of giving everyone wallets (because nobody is going to want to store all of their money in one place), a means to transfer money on said wallet, and a means to replace lost wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:54:44
Distribution is the limiting factor here. It's not too bad giving an upper middle class person living in a big city a brand new wallet. Now, what about the random person living North Dakota that only intermittently interacts with the economy? Are they now out of it completely? Think of the cost of transport. 
On top of that, there's no reason to believe that there wouldn't be banks for Bitcoin. Maybe I don't want to store my entire fortune in a safe at home because it'd be risky.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:29:23
Less than a week ago, you literally said 


9 days ago, you said


Maybe you are not as good as you think you are at predicting the future. I'm surprised that you can be so confident in this prediction, given that you were horrendously wrong in your recent history.

This is exactly the same as bitcoin. You know that your coin is not worth 10k anymore because other similar cars are being sold for much lower. *You* don’t have to make the transaction yourself. The market for cars with engines blown up determines the price for you.
If there is no trade, your asset is worth $0, as in, if nobody is willing buy and/or sell bitcoin, both your car and bitcoin would be worth $0 or, at least, unknown.
