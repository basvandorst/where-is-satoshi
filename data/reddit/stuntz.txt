Is there currently a way we can set up our own lightning node? If so I'd love to give it a try. I already have a full node up..

My super-libertarian college roommate believes that movie and its "liberal agenda" make you believe that the companies were behind pushing the bad loans but in fact it was the government that truly caused the collapsed due to poor policies. So there's that. Idk which entity is more to blame.

The fees they pay is the reason why we can get transactions reversed and cards replaced easily when stolen. Notice how there is no fee when using debit cards and also no easy way to get cash back if you want to reverse the transaction (like accidentally using venmo to send rent money to some dude who totally isn't your landlord via debit card) . Those fees exist for a reason.

May want to diversify with some low-cost index funds if you haven't done so yet.

You can't ever control yields. You CAN control costs. Even if you make money you'll be paying for losses in a downturn. Long-term, costs should be the bigger decider. Costs, even fractions of a percent, will eat your gains in numbers much higher than you think.

My college roommate has an econ degree and his simple question is this:" Why would anyone willingly use a deflationary currency when you know it'll be worth more tomorrow? How can you use a currency that is so volatile in value? If you have to choose, you won't choose the volatile option. Deflation is uncontrollable, inflation is. We have tools to keep inflationary currency in check, and since money is debt you cannot have an advanced, flexible economy without modern fractional reserve banking methods and tools. There are reasons why people moved away from gold. Bitcoin is simply a poor tool for transacting, excluding the innovations in transferring peer to peer and its speed. It solves a transfer problem, not a value problem. "
I admit I can't really argue this. He worked at a credit union and a bank for a while so knows details about money many of us don't. He is curious about bitcoin in a passing way but laughs at the notion that banks will be toppled.

Yeah, it's a good post, I actually read this savage takedown a month or so ago.

Yes but if you use low-cost index funds it can be much less, haha

I think this thought process is slightly disingenuous. Financing is not used exclusively by governments. Something as simple as getting a home loan or asking a bank for a loan to build a new warehouse if you're a sole proprietor or a corporation is not an "evil" use. Sure you can argue that fractional reserve banking, wherein money is lent at interest from the FED to the government creates debt which can enslave people is evil, but arguably if you had better financial education you would have fewer people consumed by debt and enslaved by it. I'm not saying our current system doesn't have issues, because it totally does, but I would also argue that perhaps we just don't have a better system yet. But if there is no way to dynamically create more money, you cannot have an economy like the one we enjoy today wherein you can get a loan and make things happen. Bitcoin would not allow that activity to happen.

Yeah, one of my replies to him was along these lines. Like if you live in a country where your national currency is worthless, bitcoin provides (as Andreas Antonopoulos says) an "exit strategy", an alternative option to participate in commerce. He was like "yeah, but those countries are shitholes." and I replied "dude, most people on planet earth live in "shit holes". So, yeah, I think from a Western point of view it is arguably a non-essential curiosity currency to economists but in other parts of the world it provides a great alternative, as long as merchants decide to take it.

I was on a cruise back in 2014 the week that Russia invaded Crimea. We were at sea for two days and then when we arrived at St. Thomas we got wifi and realized the world map changed. We were like "WE'RE GONE FOR THREE FREAKING DAYS AND THE RUSSIANS ARE WAGING WAR?". That was otherwise a fun week.

I don't really understand how your question is relevant. You can buy a phone with dollars and not necessarily bitcoin. You probably COULD, but even then, given Bitcoin's explosive growth, why would you purchase a phone with it when a year from now you could likely purchase a used car? Hell, even a cheap new car? I can't honestly answer the question beyond "because you can and it's possible." If you are rational, and you have two currencies to choose from, being USD/EUR vs BTC, how do you convince someone to choose the more volatile and unpredictable method? Sure it could go to zero in theory but it could also explode back to $10k USD equivalent. Would you willingly take that gamble in order to justify spending it?
Source: Used Bitcoin last year to buy gift cards. I sorta regret that now seeing as how the value has increased much beyond January 2017 prices. If I knew then what I know now, I would have just HODL'd. Choosing to spend a currency "because you can" despite the fact that it can deflate later and buy you more is not rational in a way that I can justify at the moment.
