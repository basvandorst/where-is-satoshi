it is important to note that it is a very complicated puzzle to solve, but incredibly easy to verify that the solution is correct (at least in my understanding, someone please verify)

OP is right.  If you want to increase adoption, stop being an asshat.  If you want this to go mainstream, most ppl will ask "dumb" questions.

I agree with the people who say it really depends on your personal risk profile.  If you ask this group, of course they will say btc will go up - that's my personal belief as well.
But what you have to decide is: are you honest with yourself that you'll be okay if things go to shit and you lose your money?  If the price goes down, is there a chance you'll have to sell?  or can you hodl until it comes back up?  what if that takes a year or more?  It sounds like yes which helps make this easier if you believe in bitcoin in the long run.
One other thought I have to add is you might want to weigh concentrating in bitcoin compared to any other investment opportunities and whether or not you prefer that risk.  Other investment opportunities might be something like lendingclub or the stock market.
Having said all that, I will say, it seems like you are in a position to take higher risk bc your worst case scenario is not that bad (e.g. not having responsibility of a family, or not living on the street, young enough to recover); this is somewhat an opportunity from that point of view if you wish to leverage those factors.  You won't always have that ability in 5-10 years.

The wallet is just a user interface.  This thread talks about how bitcoin would work “under the hood”.  And under the hood, as currently designed with “replace by fee”, it is easy to resend the same transaction with a higher fee.  In fact, it was a feature that was added.

So basically, to answer OPs question, BTC can’t be used as a payment system; it needs LN.

I never used the words double spend. 
With replace by fee, the coins have only been spent once, but in the context of this question and purchases at stores/retailers in general, the retailer could be fooled into thinking the customer has spent the money because the transaction/payment was broadcast with 0 conf; but unless they wait 10 minutes for a confirmation then can’t be sure that another transaction wasn’t broadcast instead with a higher fee. 
So you can call that problem whatever you want.  It’s still a problem.
