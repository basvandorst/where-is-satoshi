This is really unprofessional of Rodger, he goes up on his high horse and tries to belittle the interviewer by talking about how much money he has, THAT is an insult and very personal. But the icing on the cake here is that he calls Bcash a company, it shows his true intentions and that he does not care about making the world a better place.

Nothing phases me at this point, it will go back up, the technology is still there, in Australia we have a company looking to roll out 1000s of ATMs it's not going anywhere.

But it's all different when it's the other way around though right?

Nothing phases me anymore, the technology is there, it's not going away, it's just matter of time before it shoots back up again and much higher.
