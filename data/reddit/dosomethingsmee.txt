The accusations of a portion of a board being sock puppets is reasonably toxic. A lot of fired up people over there were banned from this subreddit for posting discrepancies with certain attitudes about adoption and crypto innovation. Nothing malicious about it. Go dig up some banning screenshots. Some are for asking completely reasonable questions about innovation and timescale. The mods here can be irrational and delete a lot of things about the long confirmations and high fees. Now they’re talking about editing the white paper to match what btc has become.

Youve just doubled back on yourself. Go try and spend your coins right now. Sorry, its been rebranded as a store for value. Merchant adoption is pointless. Remember steam just dropped it? 
Your main argument in your last post is pizza is unhealthy.

Nobody is shilling. Its market adoption and rational investing in a usable version of what we’ve all been so excited about. Dont invest emotionally. Coinbase is a business doing what business do. Adoption for profit. People are starting to understand whats happening in the crypto-space. BTC is an unwise investment at this point with high transaction times and fees. There is no censorship on r/btc and mod logs are wide open. Nobody is attacking btc. The global market is speaking. Bitcoin is way bigger than whats happening on your reddit app. People are spread across the entire planet and theyre all having a similar conversation. BCH will win because it doesnt make sense for it not to.

You are literally doing here what you don’t like to read there. People are constantly tipping each other in r/btc and the excitement is about adoption. What dont you like about bch?

Ive used it. Now I don’t because I cant :( how long are you confirmations on that transaction?

And then the mempool gets clogged again and we have the same fucking discussion, forever. It doesnt work, youre wrong. Bitcoin is like digital gold now, which is stupid. Far from the original idea. People want pizza, and they want it now. Easy to understand. Your irrational position will leave you holding a bag.
