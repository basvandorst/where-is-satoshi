No kidding?

The devil is in the details 
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:00:16
Smart move.

I mean I am pretty sure Dogecoin is a joke... not really a scam
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:14:08
Yup, Black Friday prices!

I take it English is not your first language? That’s okay, but simmer down there. He’s not calling you anything, he is saying he disagrees with your interpretation is all.

Well played credit cards
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:11:26
Have a job but still need more money... 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:31:21
Three packs a day almost certainly ha COPD

I was thinking he was going full Manson and eating some dude named dick... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:18:17
Please don’t 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:49:36
I don’t really feel bad for me either, but it is a shit ton of taxes 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:31:49
Yeah gave up TV about two years ago. Absolutely no regrets 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:23:22
Litecoin isn’t so bad 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:55:30
laser disk was cool as hell though 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:46:05
haven't purchased anything yet... the mining operations continue
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:31:36
I’m not a lawyer, but for example when I exchanged USD for Philippine peso I didn’t pay capital gains on price fluxautions in that currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:58:45
But you sold that item for currency. Value of goods is not always as clear cut. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:08:28
Actually I think there are storage services for bitcoin specific protection now... 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:58:51
My only question is how do I get involved with the bench of nerds? Are the nerds sitting on the bench? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:28:46
And spending bitcoin isn't exactly selling it. Its an exchange. I don't sell my money when I buy something. I exchange it for goods. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:27:58
But this is pretty hard to keep track of I would think. And what about in other countries? Where do the purchases have to be made? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:57
Capitol losses even 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:01:25
My payday is tomorrow and potentially have a bonus in this check... here's hoping
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:43:37
Same thing with “luxury” rentals... 
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:41:55
Block chain is not really a commodity 
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:59:15
Waiting for a sale... also buying now 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:46:05
haven't purchased anything yet... the mining operations continue
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:05:30
Yeah that’s more what I would worry about 
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:15:37
Turns out you should have sold ...
