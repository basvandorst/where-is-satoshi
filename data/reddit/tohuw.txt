Too much trouble in Google's eyes. BTC is a competition to their models, not a complement.

**I'm** not sure **how** reliable your criticism is if you can't be bothered to complete your sentences, or look up a rather common English word and realize from context that it is quite correct.

FOIA won't help you here. There's too many applicable escape clauses.

And if I put it in a safe, I must remember the combination. And if I don't put it in a safe, it is vulnerable.
At some point, you have to put the onus on the owner for securing data. I'm simply arguing that digital security outstrips the capabilities of physical security in this context.

As an American with a great amount of disdain for the current state of our Government and policies, I must heartily disagree. Not only are there multiple ISP choices across most metropolitan areas, there is also no federally-mandated block list like the one in England. Now, the US Government has shut down several sites with court orders, which I frankly don't think should ever happen. But being blocked from BTC sites because of "possible illegal activity" is not likely to happen in the near future here.
America is woefully far from the country described in our Constitution, but I'd have to say on a day-to-day basis freedom has a better outlook than the UK. Especially if the current trend against the NSA continues.
But, in the end, totalitarianism is inevitable. Everywhere, every time.

I must disagree. I can encrypt digital information such that retrieving it would be orders of magnitude harder than a physical equivalent.

Well said. America has a share of problems, I'll grant you that any day. The drone strikes are at the top of my list, closely followed by the NDAA, Patriot Act and NSA illegal wiretapping. I was only trying to state that being totally denied access to sites is far more rare.
I really should have qualified this better as saying "freedom of speech and access thereto." On the flip side, there's merit to the adage, "a true friend stabs you from the front." Is it better to have more apparent freedoms only to have others less visibly confiscated?

Ouch, that sucks. Even in bass-ackwards Cincinnati we have Time Warner, Cincinnati Bell and some niche players here and there. Yeah, don't get me wrong, that whole deal could use some serious improvement.
Like, reliable, secure high-speed wireless. That would really change things.

I agree with your premise, but the use of terrorism as a means to confiscate citizen's freedoms, whether at home or abroad, is certainly relevant to an "Orwellian state". However, I believe we're at far greater risk of becoming a "[Huxlian State](

Sorry, but you didn't make that many claims. It would have been relatively easy to provide citations for all your core points. Good sources for the drone strikes, though, and as I already said, I thought your original statements were poignant.
