I bought BTC on Coinbase 2 weeks, and transferred to my offline wallet - all pre-split. Do I now (post-split) also have BCC somewhere? If so, where, and how to access it?
I guess I don't really understand this split well... Any assistance appreciated.

Oh, and BTW thanks for that link, but unfortunately, it does not grade these providers' support, which is the major point in my post.

You may be right. It may be my CC. But that's beside the point. They are handling large amounts of money, but can't be reached to help? F that.

Does that mean I have BOTH BTC and BCC? Or do I need to choose one? How do they relate to one another?

Sorry for my slowness (it is the weekend), but if you don't mind, I'd like to recap all I picked up from you helpful people, since it still makes little sense to me that value was created from thin air. Hers where I am:
1. Let's say I bought 100mbtc for $300 on Coinbase and transferred to Electrum wallet
2. Split occurred
3. Create new wallet, and transfer all contents to it (do I need to pay a fee for this?)
4. Install Electron Cash *on a different machine*
5. Restore wallet from secret key phrase. Wait for it to sync with BCC
6. I now have 2 wallets: one with my original 100mbtc, and one with x mbcc 
7. When Coinbase starts supporting BCC next January, I can (potentially) transfer both my btc *and* bcc back to Coinbase and convert them back to $ - getting more than the $300 I started with ?!
It's that last step that gets me: where does this extra value come from. Or am I missing something? 
Thanks for your patience and assistance.

How's their support?
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:18:40
They could at least put something like zendesk, or hire some interns to online chat. With potentially large amounts of money going back and forth, and potential mistakes, the fact they don't even have a phone number is borderline criminal.

Thank you all for your time and advice!
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:04:30
And how's their support? Also, will they require any ID?
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:07:23
Electrum. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:01:33
So how do you keep payments anonymous?
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:59:49
How do I go about doing that?
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:12:27
That's not how you build, or roll out a service. You can either support your customers, or you're heading for a fall. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:03:30
Just read some reviews. Major complaints are that their support cannot be reached. Sounds familiar to me. I'll pass.

I don't want to spend extra, but I'm a bit weary of connecting my checking account. 
And LocalBitcoins looks like too much work and trust (everyone there wants a photo of your id, standing at a bank, near a check, with a basket of fruit on your head - just to sell you 10mbtc).
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:05:29
This post has been removed. Do you have the original perhaps?
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:16:36
No ID, but I had to provide name and street address.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:51:31
What to fee do you pay to get it done in 10 minutes? I waited literally hours for a transaction to complete. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:45:17
You had me there, until I reached “quickly“ :)

Fine. He got a very fancy house in Miami. It's now under water.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:02:27
He bought his own island. Sadly, it got wiped out by Hurricane Irma.

Do you have to verify your ID to Coinbase for a USD account?
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:19:29
I disagree. When I first bought, I was asked for how many $ do I want to purchase. A week later, when the money was transferred, they purchased BTC for that specified amount. Since spot went up, I ended up with less BTC.

Use the app. Their web site sucks. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:19:06
Nope. To buy/sell from a checking account, you don’t need to go through the process, but apparently you do if you want to maintain a USD account on hand at  Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:04:26
Ok, I'm hoping you are right :)
Thanks for taking the time to answer!
