I think Gold buyers and Bitcoin buyers are all on the same page when it comes to supporting sound money. 
Bitcoin is the product of the free market coming together to try and find alternatives to government mandated fiat currencies. It is a game changing technology and we are happy to accept it at Euro Pacific Metals.

Bitcoin does have value and we’ve experienced it firsthand. We’ve found the bitcoin process to be incredibly convenient and by far the most efficient way to transact. BitPay has been great to work with.

You don’t have the ability to send bitcoin to robinhoood. You can only buy and sell within their platform

I use blockchain wallet and keep a couple hundred dollars worth of btc in there if I ever want to buy something with it but all of my other crypto is in cold storage, which I highly recommend if you’re only going to sit on your coins

Except with robinhood you do not have access to your bitcoin. You can not send it to a different wallet. Robinhood is an exchange where you can only buy and sell, not send or receive.
