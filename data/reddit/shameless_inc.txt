You're welcome :)

You can also install the parental controls app on your phone and activate it with the console to get more details reports on playtime. You don't need to block anything for that either.
The only two (minor) downsides are the icon on the home screen (at the top middle, indicating parental controls are on) and that you have to enter a 4-digit PIN for some actions (i.e. connecting to a new WiFi network or disconnecting).

Go fork yourself

Weird. Do you have any malware protection running? You could disable that temporarily to test it.
Also, try unzipping the Miner once again, it helped when it refused to work after Avast blocked it.
Btw, did you download it from the actual Nicehash website or some other source? If not, get it from their website while you're at it.
I hope you can get it to work so you can also pimp your GPU for crypto :)

Well, you could get a wallet app on your phone (I'd recommend Mycelium if you're running Android, I heard breadwallet is good for iOS). You then click receive Bitcoin and it'll give you an address.
You then start the Nicehash Miner, put that address in, double, triple, quadruple check that you got it right and click start (verify your GPU is checked as a mining device only, CPU doesn't really seem viable).
And that's it. It's even got a link that shows you statistics of how much Bitcoin you've earned.
Nicehash will automatically determine what's most profitable to mine at all times and switch between cryptocurrencies automatically. Regardless of what you mine, Nicehash will pay you in Bitcoin.
You might need to disable your antivirus or malware scanner, since they might see the miners as riskware (as they're often embedded into malware so the malware programmer can make some money, I suppose).
The Miner has a GUI and is actually pretty easy to use. Do you get any errors that might give a hint at what's failing?

Hey, I use the Nicehash miner since it pays me directly in Bitcoin and it's also pretty easy to use. It has a GUI (but is Windows only).
Just google it, you should be able to get it directly from the Nicehast website.

Best of luck :)

Same with my 1070. I like to call the mining the "night shift" :P
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:06:01
Nice! I see you at the yacht club buddy!

Well, I'm from Germany and I'd say the education is at least kinda decent. It might be lacking in some areas but when you're willing to learn you get the chance to do so. We suck at the [PISA study]( though.
English will get you pretty far in Germany but you'd need to learn some German sooner or later.
I like my country and if I were to leave it, I'd maybe consider the scandinavian countries, because they seem modern and progressive to me. (I'd get a more in-depth impression first by going there, though. At this point I just kinda find them sympathic and heard some good things.)

No, it's micro-Bitcoin (as i 1/1,000,000 of a Bitcoin), also known as just a bit.
A microbit would be ฿ 1/1,000,000,000,000. A Satoshi is ฿ 1/10,000,000, so a microbit would be a sub-Satoshi amount.
No offense here, I get that you probably understand this but we really need to be exact about the naming to avoid confusion. The Copay Wallet developers [refused to include mBTC as a unit]( because they fear such confusion.
(I like mBTC since they're closer to fiat money in terms of value which makes it easier but I get their argument, I just don't agree tbh. Still, if using bits the 1,000's separation comma helps to think of mBTC if you read from the fourth digit starting from the right side).

This is too good.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:20:58
Too real. Is there hope for feasible microtransactions?
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:56:10
Holy shit.
I'm sorry to hear what happened to your cousin. I hope she will fully recover. The situation seems really screwed up and the warehouse story is such bs (regarding the stories they made up).
Thank you for the insight. I hope you find a place where you can live and feel home at. Do you already have any idea where you might go?
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:42:48
Thanks! That makes me hopeful.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:58:17
To the moo^oo^^oo^^^oo^^^^oon

About 0.8-0.9 mBTC :(
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:29:02
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:08:59
Not bad though! The grammar wasn't perfect but this was pretty good already :)
I wish you best of luck and I hope you end up in a place you like, whereever that might be!

I'm curious. What's so corrupt about that government? One does not hear too much about it from outside.

Can confirm that the Mycelium seed is compatible with Copay and Samourai.
In Copay you'll have to create a new wallet and select from seed rather than restoring from a backup though. If you try restoring from backup it'll let you know that upon entering the seed, though.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:25:05
Yeah. If you're wallet puts a separation comma, you basically get to read it mBTC as well:
1,000 bits = 1.000 mBTC
I find this worthy of pointing it out, even though probably most people realize it since it helps me to be able to deal with both bits and mBTC.

The fees make me sad.
