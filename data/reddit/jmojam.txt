Honestly, use Cash App for a lot of my personal revenue collection and bought a couple hundred worth of BTC on a whim and just enjoy
Watching it go up and down. Would love if you did a FAQ or something for CashAppBTC users!

Stop DCAing and holding. You should play the lows and highs, bro. Timing the market is too easy, bro.
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:54:33
Hahaha, it just dropped 500.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:42:05
Hey, this isn’t a well-crafted meme!
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:58:19
5000 isn’t the moon though.
@_date: 2019-02-25 00:56:31
It kinda sounds like a joke.

Easter Sunday. BTC has not risen....

Would you mind dropping a services list in sats? Like, how much for an hour, etc?
@_date: 2019-04-02 11:40:04
Bois, I JUST got back in at 3700! Let’s go to the moon!

Cash App, bro. They now allow you to deposit and withdraw to a 3rd party wallet. Will typically charge world’s smallest fee. For example if price is shown at 7800, they’ll sell to you at 7950. 
For the “not your keys, not your coin” crowd, with the update to withdraw, it’s a non-issue.

I thought it was intended, as this is how my Colombian friend would say it. His English is poor.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:25:24
You’re one hundred percent right. 
We don’t know.

Bought at 3400. Panic sold on the way down to 4200. Bought back in at 5k. I’m not good at this. I’m hodling til NASA brings me home now.
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:23:51
Bro. It touched 7600 while you slumbered!
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:08:03
Do you have any articles or sources about this? I’ve heard about coat averaging but have not researched it.

I HODL through Cash APP but then play with about 20% of my portfolio trading BTC through Robinhood playing the dips. I find this satiates the desire to sell my main stash.
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:17:26
Lotta skin in the game, huh?
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:10:22
I’m almost impressed how low effort this is. ��

Has anyone ever thread DBZ together without all the unbelievable filler or reused fight scenes?
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:12:40
I could’ve before it hit, but I wasn’t even notified of the spike until the notification that it had sold. Imagine my disgust to watch it climb 400 more afterwards! Ha
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:18:46
Yo, it is pretty gross over there.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:14:12
Hey listen, I agree with you. I HODL, too. Just play dips to accumulate fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:16:40
I like and highly agree with everyone here. I guess, to be honest, I’m waiting for a certain threshold of “oh, this is really happening” in terms of worth before I walk down the hot/cold wallet path. My mind is set on adoption though, and would love to spend SATS places...but as you all know, it’s few and far between.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:08:23
I love this, man.
