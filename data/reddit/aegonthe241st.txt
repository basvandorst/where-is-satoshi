What is the lightning network? And what's so good about it?

Yup, in the UK as well. The Coinbase app is great and the UI is incredibly easy to use which makes me hesitant to change though

The website says it's a Bitcoin wallet. So does the app on the startup tutorial page

Is there a good mobile app for Gdax?

I'm in the UK and using Coinbase. Why am I allowed to deposit money from my UK bank account into the EUR Wallet but not the GBP Wallet?

With it being added to Coinbase, will it not just be an easy way to make a quick profit?

Seeing a lot of hate for BTCash. What's so bad about it? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:10:52
Ahh ok. Any recommendations for an Android wallet for a newbie to Bitcoin then?

Are there any solutions to trying to deposit money from my UK bank account to GDAX then?

How good is the Bitcoin.com Wallet? New to Bitcoin and just learning about them, seems like a good starting place

Am I not able to use Coinbase to sell?
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:12:52
Will do. Thanks

Brand new to Bitcoin, I bought £5 worth through Coinbase, now that it's dipping I'm looking to buy more. Is there a better service to use that has less fees?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:26:03
Just signed up with my Coinbase account. Does this mean the Bitcoin I already bought is tied to this Gdax account?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:22:59
Exactly my plan. Don't mind about losing too much since it doesn't affect me week to week
