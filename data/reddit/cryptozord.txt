Are you using GDAX to reduce your fees? Same organisation just a different site. Same login details so no need to re-register. Use limit orders to eliminate your trading fees. And withdrawing from GDAX to your wallet or another exchange, GDAX pays the fee for you.

I thought the only time a currency is singular is when there is only one unit. For example one dollar, one pound, ten dollars, ten pounds??

I would say yes it should be fine in my experience however don't take that as gospel. If its your first time maybe wait for the test to complete, just in case there are any issues. That's the reason you did the test in the first place i assume.

There are 160K unconfirmed transactions at the moment, and if you used an economic fee that means you will probably be towards the end. Miners will always go for transactions with the highest fee.
This site also shows the amount of transactions for each fee band.

UK here. Adding to what others have said, if you withdraw from GDAX or Coinbase in Euro direct to your bank, it is likely you will get additional charges and crappy exchange rates to change it to GBP from your bank. I have used the Revolut app which lets you exchange between currencies at the best rate and doesn't add any charges. Withdraw from GDAX in euro to revolut &gt; exhange to GBP &gt; send to UK Bank. Search reddit for guides on how to do this. There are loads.

I have been sending BTC to binance from GDAX over the last couple of weeks and haven't had any issues. Usually takes a few hours, but GDAX pays the fees for so cant really complain.
