No, you're not. :D

Serious question. Do you think Raspberry Pi's are compromised as well?
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:40:55
Then there's no escape :(

I have a few Live CDs/DVDs that I use once in a while. Shouldn't be a problem for me.

I like that solution. I wish I could implement it as an actual card, sadly I don't see that being secure enough. 
Card is much fancier than paper, you see.

Your solution is the closest to what I originally thought and posted about, although a bit expensive.
Doesn't this suffer from the same issues as the plastic cards as someone else posted above?
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:17:24
Any other fancy and cheap solutions that you suggest?
I don't like the idea of holding that kind of stuff on my computer, such as wallets and so on. I'd like to have a card, if possible, of course.
I'd like to have a card for small expenses, and another as a piggy bank towards bigger investments in my life.

I wish I shared the same opinion. Right now I barely know what a private key is, except I should keep it safe.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:53:35
I see. Can the standard version hold multiple wallets(one for savings, another for regular expenses)?
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:08:04
One more thing, please. Let's say I can lose that wallet. What backup methods do you suggest?
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:03:00
I don't understand what you meant.
Why is that?
What does HODLer mean?

I'm very paranoid about losing data due to something like a HDD failure or worse, someone installing a keylogger and getting my info.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:45:53
How is this different from a standard USB flash drive?
I'm sure there must be a difference, but I can't see which.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:51:53
Now that we're on-topic. Any Bitcoin-specific distros that you recommend that were specially tailored for this?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:33:19
I've always wanted to buy some bitcoins, but the lack of BTC ATM's in my country made me put that idea on hold, so yeah...
I guess it's the same for many folks. If we had Bitcoin ATM's it would be a different story...

I REALLY like the card, but my smartphone doesn't have a NFC reader sadly(it is a Samsung Galaxy Core 2 Duos, and I really need the dual-sim)...
