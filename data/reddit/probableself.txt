I haven't done this, but it seems like a way to do this would be to go to Newegg.com and purchase a Steam gift card with your Bitcoin (since Newegg accepts Bitcoin).  Then of course use your Steam gift card to buy the games.

My understanding is that the Xpub is not something to share.  I want the "shareable" public key.  The one that I wouldn't have any safety issues posting to a public forum.

Are you talking about Sentinel QR, the Android app?

Heck, most people don't know what the word "fiat" means.
It's a car, right?

That's it!  Dangit, that was easy.  I knew it probably would be.  I just needed my memory jogged since I'd just been holding and hadn't done anything with my funds/wallet in a while.
As for the xpub, just google Bitcoin extended public key.  It's the master public key used in a hierarchical deterministic wallet.  New, different child public keys are generated with every transaction, derived from the master extended public key.  At least that's the way I understand it.

Really?  I admit I haven't tried it yet, but I went through selecting a $20 Steam card, selecting bitcoin as the payment method, and it got all the way through to what should be the very last step before doing the send transaction.  Does Newegg reject it at the very last step or something?  Which would seem strange.

The average Joe is not going to understand blockchain, hardware and paper wallets, BIP # whatever, private and public keys, the immutable nature of transactions, mining, proof of stake or work, the decentralized nature of it which necessitates greater personal responsibility and no central authority to go to for help/disputes, etc. etc.  
Hell, I am tech-savvy and it's taken me a while to wrap my head around certain concepts.  And that's not even including deep-diving into the tech behind it or reading whitepapers, which I do also.  That's just figuring out what it is, how it works, how best to secure the funds, how to do a send/receive transaction, and so on.  
I don't consider myself an expert by any means, still more of a noob really, but at least I can soak this info up like a sponge more readily, and feel reasonably confident with it, though I probably still ask "stupid" questions from time to time.  It's part of the learning process.  Joe Q. Average will probably have a much tougher time of it.  I would say it needs to be a lot -- I mean, a LOT -- easier to understand and use in order to gain mass adoption.  
But I still think it'll get there.  Whatever form it eventually takes, this tech is here to stay.
