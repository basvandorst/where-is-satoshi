MERRY CHRISTMAS TO US!!!

I concur. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:11
Yeah exactly, woman here and I am in the exact same spot. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:07:09
Good! It will leave more for us.

More so he was just trying to invest in my future, for that I am grateful. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:33:32
Are you trolling us or something? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:30:02
It won't :) 
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:05:09
Thanks for the clarification!

“You know,” said Arthur, “it’s at times like this, when I’m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I’d listened to what my mother told me when I was young.”
“Why, what did she tell you?”
“I don’t know, I didn’t listen.”

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Since I am a woman that loves crypto, does this mean I am a misogynistic shitlord? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:29:53
It won't :) it was a gift under the table! 
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:04:45
I respect your decision then!

Thanks for the (and ladies)... lady here, always chuckle when I see "we did it boys!" etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:10:38
3/10 for me. RIP me.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:01:13
OP, you don't seem like the bitcoin type.
One thing is you should never put more into it than you are willing to lose (like any investment) and if you are uncomfortable don't do it. But then you have no reason to complain when we head to the moon.

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:22:32

Me too... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:27:38

It's what I'm doing!

As a person that has worked in a financial institution for many years now, FDIC and NCUA is a bunch of garbage. I wouldn't be here in r/bitcoin, buying bitcoin if I had faith that if a major crash happened that NCUA/FDIC could actually bail each person out for $250,000.
