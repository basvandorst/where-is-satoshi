Not sure I understand. What do you mean? How is that the same amount?

Its not binary. They can both advance in different ways and be useful. The only detriment to this fork is this petty nonsense that shifts blame to ideological differences instead of respecting it and the innovation that comes from competition. I guess i'm saying give it break and focus on advancing bitcoin so it can survive rather than trashing bch so it gets destroyed

I'm not taking a side on the bch vs btc debate but I cannot stand when people take one position and don't offer the opposing point of view. It weakens their argument so much because its obvious they are hiding something. Its the same thing from the BCH side calling LN centralized or something, without offering an explanation or thorough insight into why they think that. They should outline both sides, say what their view is and why, and then let the reader decide. This was just pure bias

Does anybody know how to deal with two situations that i'm in.
1) I bought bitcoin back then and immediately put it into an online sportsbook and obviously lost it gambling at some point cause i'm horrible at gambling. How do i report that?
2) Some friends didn't have a coinbase account so they would give me money to buy the bitcion and then i would send it to them. How do they know whats my bitcoin and what was my friends?

Mostly, right?
He incentives honest nodes over dishonest nodes. Sorta counter intuitive but I guess it words because greed makes people behave rather than try and deceive
