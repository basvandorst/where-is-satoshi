No, ironically I validated the account through their invasive process, and jumped through all of the hoops.
...it just won't let me withdraw to my bank account.  The deposit confirmation feature isn't working.  Seriously, that's the part that the software is bugging out on.  Coinbase is missing out on their commission simply because their deposit confirmation is buggy, even though I'm willing to sign off on the risk.  Such clunky software!

It didn't work, coinbase is just bugging.  I'm going to try a different exchange.  Thanks again!

I'm in glorious USA.  I certainly appreciate your recommendations.  I'll check out those exchanges that you mentioned.  
I appreciate the advice and I will take considerable pains to validate the process before moving any volume of money through.  I am in no mood to be hustled and agree that scams and problems are both less likely if I can keep the volumes down.  
It's funny, when I talk to people about this sort of thing, usually either they're trying to do something sneaky (which I don't have a problem with, but I'm in no position to help) or else they think I'm trying to do something sneaky (just buying a car!!) so it's been perplexing.  I really appreciate the advice and am amazed at how friendly people are in this community.  I'm older and it reminds me of the early days of web technology or Ebay, the sense of community.
