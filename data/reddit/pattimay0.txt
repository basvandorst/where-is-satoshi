I believe smart contracts are being worked on for btc as well but obviously are not as developed as eth's

You can't collateralize a loan with it (yet)

Part of my day-to-day requires me to deal with commercial real estate loan servicers, who employ tons of medium to low-skill people in places like Overland Park KS because it's cheap to hire them. A key responsibility of these large servicers (basically without exception, divisions of v large banks) is to take money the borrower is required to escrow - for things like capital improvements, taxes and insurance -to take that money from the borrower and give it to the insurer or relevant government, or to take it from the capital improvements reserve account and give it back to the borrower, once certain tasks have been accomplished. I've never seen P&amp;Ls specific to servicing divisions, but given the fact that they're located in, like, Kansas and Charlotte, you can generally guess it's a cost-competitive industry with thin margins.
A smart contract that automatically disburses money to the appropriate party once the required set of boxes are checked will allow these banks to save MASSIVE amounts of overhead , to the point where in the not-all-that-distant future it will be impossible to compete in the servicing business without a smart-contract-centric cost structure. There will still probably be human beings verifying the transactions, but their numbers are going to be reduced substantially, costs to borrowers will decrease and speed and efficiency will increase.
Also there may be a lot more unemployed people in Overland Park KS.
