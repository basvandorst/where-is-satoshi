But at least with stable coins, market cap is actually a meaningful metric. If they are properly regulated.

Given the code quality of OpenSSL, I'd consider this not a reassuring comment.
I would expect finding lots of bugs. :-)

Malta though is also quite popular lately.
UK would be an odd choice given the uncertainties of Brexit. But I guess they can wait and see if the final agreement with the EU rules out the UK.

I guess it's more along the lines of "Just play along with the hard fork and nobody gets hurt." or "Core hurts the idea of Bitcoin so much that we need to do that and everybody who gets hurt along the way is collateral damage for the greater good".
I actually don't care how they justify their actions. I also don't care how the core dev team justifies whatever action they are taking in response to 2X. In the end, it's not about talk but about actions and we will see finally an end to the whole scaling debate one way or another.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:02:46
Care to elaborate? I don't think they have a weak position at all and IMO it doesn't make sense to play nice for them (as they already tried that with the HKA, NYA, and the various Bitcoin Something alternative clients and that failed).
There is already Bitcoin Cash, making another altcoin from Bitcoin doesn't make sense either.

AFAIK, most ASIC-resistant coins try to leverage the GPU memory to reduce usefullness of the processor optimizations you are talking about.
Memory is a generic part of modern processor architecture, you can't make that any faster than it is already. The computing part OTOH can and has been optimized by different manufacturer, this is exactly what ASICs are.
If Bitcoin had historically added such an algorithm, I guess in the worst case, we wouldn't be in a different state than we are now. Large mining farms and very few mining manufacturer, just that they would have started out as GPU manufacturer.

But only if there are 2 surviving chains. Which is not the plan for btc1.
If there are 2 chains afterwards, something went terribly wrong. But this being crypto, expect something to go terribly wrong.
I will get a bucket of popcorn and will try to enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:23:20
Sure. I didn't say that you can't. But not with GPUs for LTC.
I would really like to know it if were feasible for Bitcoin to be ASIC-resistant. LTC started out as such but didn't keep up unfortunately.

I think if they can't pull off a successful hard fork and dethroning core with 80% or more hash rate support, then nobody will be able to do it in any other way.
At least for finishing the scaling debate, I'm optimistic. I'm not sure which outcome would be best for the future of Bitcoin, though.

Achievement unlocked: *being accused of being a paid shill*
I would gladly be paid for just telling my opinion. But so far, nobody stepped forwards and asked me for a Bitcoin address.
If you really think that the 2X HF can easily be contained and that it is no threat whatsoever, that's not my problem.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:33:46
There will be two chains but will both be viable to mine and will it be economically sensible to do so? That's what I mean with "surviving".
Disregard any possible hard fork from the core side. Let's say 2X happens and a large amount of miners switch. That's means that the miners on the pre-fork chain are facing a large difficulty that means very slow transactions and a long time until difficulty adjustments will bring it down. Whereas the forked chain can happily churn along and mine blocks almost as if nothing had happened.
How long will the non-switching miners even be willing to support the pre-fork chain when they are losing money? We can see right now with BCH that a lot of miners switch for the quick buck.
How long will exchanges hold out until they cave in? I suspect they will hold withdrawals and deposits (no replay protection so that's the safe thing to do) shortly before the hard fork and wait a while until a clear winner has emerged. Which is probably at least a few days, if not even weeks. The longer this period lasts the more people will panic sell their Bitcoins. Uncertainty is always bad for the price.
Of course, this is the simple case. But core won't do nothing if the forked chain might overtake the pre-fork chain.
That's gonna be interesting to see unfold but also potentially dangerous for all involved. In that case, we could very well see two surviving chains but if core does some hard forking of their own, we would actually have two new alt coins.

The GPU ship sailed a long time ago for LTC.
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:05:43
That fixes only the problems you have with miners. Fighting a HF with a HF opens a whole different can of worms, though.
For example, a PoW change would also be an implicit replay protection, so there was no reason for exchanges not to list both. Or SPV wallets wouldn't be able to use the new Core chain but the 2X chain would be fine.
In such a case and with the following turmoil and chaos, I wouldn't put my money on *any* Bitcoin being  afterwards. :-|
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:44:07


That's the most important bit to keep in mind for everything concerning Segwit2X. Adding replay protection or anything else that would make a peaceful coexistence with the non-2X chain possible is absurd in that POV.
The proponents of the 2X HF want it to be Bitcoin. A better Bitcoin in their opinion.
So it's not "a lone rational voice" but just someone who hasn't understood what they are trying to do.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:24:31
They have the consensus of most of the miners. That's something we can't ignore.
I wouldn't put too much weight on the low nodes count. Signalling has always been an unreliable metric and now with 0.15.0 it got even more unreliable (if I were running a full node and intended to support 2X, I would not signal until close to the HF because of 0.15.0).
Also don't underestimate the pockets of the Chinese miners. Spinning up a bunch of nodes is done easily, as we have seen in the past.
It will be a contentious HF for sure. I think that it will in the end come down to if exchanges falter in case BTC's hashrate drops to unsustainable levels.

Congrats. I hope you enjoy the next dip.

You might give core a little bit too much credit. It's not only core that's part of the bitcoin development, but also the processes and all the contributors around it. And that's not a small part.
I've seen that with other dev teams. The official dev team gets all the bug reports and is the main channel through which development happens. But that doesn't make them irreplaceable and I've often seen forks gaining traction that eventually surpassed the original project.
Of course, with bitcoin we have the additional problem that money is involved. But that's only a minimal additional constraint.
IMHO if the experiment that bitcoin still is, can't survive and improve upon a situation as segwith2x, it's going to fail anyway.

I've seen this mentioned a few days ago on a [Forbes contributor's blog](
The quotes from the experts are the best part. :-)
It was obvious that this was something out of the ordinary. Nobody would fall for such a blatant attempt at gaming the searches. OTOH, this *is* crypto after all.

In hindsight, now that you know how Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market developed, what role do you think would MtGox have played if the final hack wouldn't have happened?
In an interview you once said you wished there were five of yourself. How crucial were you for the day to day business of MtGox and what would have happened if you were hit by a bus?
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:32:21


Exactly. I don't think this can be stressed enough. We've seen now a design flaw in Ethereum that will have an impact on any newly designed cryptocurrency. The chain that lost out on the fork shouldn't be able to make a comeback within DAYS (of course, if the hash rate goes up again, that's a different issue but the ETC chain was already viable again before that happened).
I think many people forget that we are still in the beginning and it is by no mean certain that Bitcoin will be the one and only digital currency of the future. Especially as it's experimental feature phase has ended, we need other cryptos that can fail or succeed to influence the further design of Bitcoin and others cryptocurrencies.
I would also be very disappointed in any Bitcoin dev (core, classic, or whatever) that would go now and point to Ethereum as an example of why one shouldn't do a hard fork in Bitcoin. This would be an insult to our and their intelligence. 
The parameters of Ethereum and Bitcoin are too different to apply them without some grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:13:35
I always thought that the experiment of Bitcoin was about everybody being economically driven to work together. The whole big blocks or SegWit or whatever snafu shows that there is more to it than just throwing out code.
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:39:14
There are efforts underway to make smart contracts more secure through various means. But yes, it's possible that smart contracts how they are implemented in Ethereum are too powerful.
Don't forget that Ethereum is not at all finished. They are still developing and enhancing it. It happened to become bigger much faster than expected. You might remember that Bitcoin had that problem, too. :)
