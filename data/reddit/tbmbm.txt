How dumb are all of you actually caring what bernanke has to say, that's like seeing a mountain form infront of your eyes and not believe it untill you get back home and wait for CNN to confirm . Bernanke's mission now is to find a way to get bitcoin under control. If it wasn't a threat they wouldn't be reporting it the way they do but you all just are waiting for president obama to say bitcoin is a currency when all you tools already know that it is a real legit currency, stop waiting for confirmation from the same people that bitcoin was intended to avoid.

You wouldn't happen to know how I could feature this would you?

I was surprised I didnt get a bunch of "idiot read this" or troll comments.
All were good.
Safe to say hope for humanity lies within the bitcoin community!

What I meant by missing bitcoin was all these tweets I read about 1 million or 5 million dollars worth of bitcoin going missing across the globe. which happens quite a bit may I add , would you happen to know if they are gone for good or maybe transferred to a different wallet?
Since Im a code noob I guess its finally Time to hit up Khan Academy!
Either way thanks all the same for your reply!
