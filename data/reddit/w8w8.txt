I have .1 BTC right now on a paper wallet. What happens to it when (or if) the hard fork happens? Do I lose it? How do I know which type of BTC it is?

I read it properly. I understand that he was trying to pay cash, but how many people do it that way? Bitcoin would indeed work better for full purchases, but the questions I said need to be answered if someone wants to take out an auto loan.

Name three credible exchanges where it hit both marks.
Edit: NOW it is below 4500, but it still never hit $5000.

So what's yours? What is your refutation to the my thoughts? What evidence do you have to refute it?
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:55:41
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that it's probably not the best idea in its current form to pay for things like mortgages and cars with Bitcoin.

My argument is that it's not worth mining in the long run. It was years ago. If OP wanted to spend money on something involving crypto he should just buy more crypto.

I emailed them when I had verification issues and they cleared it through once they both sets of info but didn't accept it. Took a week of course but it was worth it.

I'm just going to go ahead and assume that you have no counter-argument. I don't know what's the deal or what's going on your life that compels you to tell strangers they're having a stroke, but it's simply not in my own best interest to continue pursuing your response.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:13:02
You give a compelling argument with plenty of backing. I'm sold!

Have you ever considered the possibility that Coinbase itself could go under? Then who "insures" your coins? You aren't safe if you don't hold private keys. I can't tell if you're trolling or not because you haven't mentioned hardware, paper, or other offline options once.

Plenty of questions to be answered. How is credit influenced by Bitcoin? Why should a car dealership give you an auto loan without knowing your financial situation? What happens to the Bitcoin after the car dealership gets it? Do they sell it for fiat or keep passing it along until they get to the point where a supplier or part manufacturer can't accept it?
You kept trying to make the argument that businesses selling you very expensive products shouldn't know what your financial situation is. Not only that, but "bank dude" isn't responsible for the fact that your finances at that bank weren't in order. If you're going to buy a vehicle you should be prepared to have a method of payment available and ready instead of just walking in like it's a retail store.
Like I said, this is for Bitcoin in its current state. Things could change years down the road, but right now it's not that great of an option. If you can think of a legitimate and viable answer for every question posed that makes sense economically then things are different, but it doesn't seem that way right now.

It is not. It's an exchange. Keeping your coins online is one of the worst ways to store crypto because you don't hold the private keys. You are entrusting a company to hold your coins for years if you take this route. It is completely naive to think that they'll reimburse any coins you may lose.

2.) We never fell to $4,500

I understand that, but most people lease or take out auto loans for vehicles instead of paying for all of it upfront.
