Nice, I'll use this next time I'm out!

Went well actually in both places I've worked now it's lead to people using bitcoin instead of iou's along with some nice increases of value for those holding on.  Case in point maybe spent $60 in drinks with a co-worker who accepted bitcoin but never cashed out.  He now has roughly $200.  Safe to say he's happy.  I know others have suggested lunch, but that may be too much for some.  Plus with $2-4 (USD), bitcoin shines compared to credit cards, atms, remittances and wiring.

Overly simplifying here, but it has value because there was work behind the creation of each bitcoin.  Work was done historically to create a crypto currency of a known scarcity, along with containing a significant amount of functionality and utility.  On top of this is the broader acceptance of it, which further adds value.  
TL;DR - limited supply + utility + demand

I really like the idea, most question sites I find have many unanswered or poor answers.  I'm eager to see how well a bounty works with this.  So far tested ChaCha and Wolfrom Alpha without a correct response, can't wait to see how it gets answered on BitQuestion.

Got one at the bitcoin summit in Philly this past weekend - great experience, good quality too.

I'm thinking it may dip to 150 if some people with deep pockets feel like unloading, or if anyone else wants to cause a flash crash.   There's several bitcoiners who have been around for the last bubble cycle and I'm thinking they'll most likely hold so that should halt the drop from going too far along with the velocity of the drop, which may explain why this drop has been less severe.  On a positive note, I think this is all aiding in building a base so that it should help for the next bust cycle from dropping too far.   One last note on this down turn, remember to assess whether anything systemic has harmed bitcoin any way to warrant the drop/gain.  If you can't pinpoint it, its probably boosted or dropping by emotions as the driver.  That being what it is, bitcoin is becoming more popular and more shops and services are accepting, so I'm bullish, but this correction seemed due at some point.

You sir speak as a wise man, and I hope many will follow you and heed your advice.   If you're in it for the long run, well volatility is going to be  your new friend, day to day this is going to be crazy, but over a year or a decade the results should speak for themselves.  Let the soft hands loosen their grips and the faithful pick up their assets for a cheaper price!

I got their ebook bundle last time around, worked out really well, hadn't heard of any of the books before but found several gems in there.  What's nice is the books have no DRM on them, and the bigger thing as mentioned in the post - they accept Bitcoins now - so win-win

I've been using coinbase for a while with no problem.  When or if you run into a problem, email them and they take care of you.   I had a transaction cancelled for high risk and after emailing them they allowed it to go through without a problem.  They're doing a great job and honestly I send people that are new to bitcoin there first as they get a wallet and option to buy bitcoins all in one place.
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:52:06
I realize this isn't ideal for all, but personally I use coinbase to coinbase transfers especially among friends, so that there's an "instant transfer".   I do this frequently for a friend who pays for lunch with fiat and I pay him back in bitcoin, works great, also a good way to get bitcoin in the hands of people who may not want to buy bitcoins through an exchange or local bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:12:41
Are you currently using an intermediary like Bitpay, or accept only bitcoin directly?

Guess another question related is by too heavy in btc do you mean your FX exposure risk is too high or do you simply not want to hold onto bitcoins - just curious

Nasty Mining is an investment group of sorts, basically you get dividends on equipment and investments the group has made.  If you are financially strapped and are interested there are 1/100th pass through shares that you can buy on some exchanges.  
@_date: 2013-08-15 23:44:01
I actually buy on coinbase and move them to paper wallets, for what it's worth coinbase is convenient if you live in the USA.   For mining investments I bought some asicminer and have since sold, but currently hold Nasty Mining seats, really confident in their management and see it as a longer term "sleeper" investment.

Damn straight man!  I think the majority of the community is reacting all wrong to this - If China wanted to kill bitcoin they wouldn't have allowed documentaries and news programs to feature it.  Ultimately I believe China is pushing to uproot the USD as a reserve currency for the bitcoin, the fact that they're requiring additional information from traders to me signifies they are treating it seriously (as it should be) and are wanting to ensure that things are done correctly now.   This is a good move forward despite the regulation that's coming with it.
@_date: 2013-10-13 23:32:56
Did the same thing, remember reading that post and thinking "internet monopoly money, this won't turn into anything!" (at the time could mine using a website and after making a few cents gave up on it as being too impractical).  After I got into mining on a gpu in 2011, stopped at one point in early January 2012 because I thought the profits weren't worth the energy costs...

Welcome to bitcoin!   I personally started mining in late 2011 and have since transitioned to mining entirely with asics from gpus.   I was initially very skeptical of bitcoin but have since wrapped my head around several of the facets that make bitcoin so revolutionary in nature.   I think you've come to bitcoin at a very historic moment, as the community has been polarized by feelings on regulation.   Personally, I suspect it'll be a mixed bag, we will get some VCs more comfortable with buying in, but it will come at the cost of more paperwork and compliance which was previously more or less voluntary.   I think the points many have made about governments taking notice does indicate that bit coin isn't going away, as perhaps some had hoped.   I think we will see a lot of growth in the next five years, but even now you are an early adopter.   It will be a bumpy ride, but nothing that is a catalyst for change comes without some growing pains.   Either way, welcome aboard, I hope you will enjoy your experiences with bitcoin and the bit coin community as much as I have!Oh, and one last thing - if you get into trading of bitcoins, remember it's difficult to outsmart the market, longer term investments are my preferred way to invest.   There will be drops and rises, but always ask yourself on drops "has the bit coin fundamentals changed in a way that makes them less valuable?" if not then don't sell it is based on emotions, and chances are you may regret it later.

How does this indicate it's speculative fad?  If anything, attention by the SEC seems to indicate it has grown to a point of not just being a fad, but something the SEC considers as within their jurisdiction.  The fact that people who were scammed by pirate may also see some justice, along with some potential returned?

I had shares of NastyMining on GLBSE and have moved over to NastyFans.org - been working well since it's been up, gives me something to look forward to every week when the dividends go out.  Can't wait until the BFL singles hit (OgNasty's in line for some of the first ones that come out).

Received mine today as well - they really look great, loving mine - and the fact that they're tied to a seat just means they'll appreciate in value.

I'm thinking they over bought chips because they were so late to the market with delivery and lost many current and potential customers.  I'm thinking this has been why they've been trying to drum up more business by sending out jalapenos to the press.   On top of this, with next generation chips and hardware in the near future they probably did the math and figured they can't dump the chips, and selling them in hardware even at a discount may not be viable due to the labor involved so selling chips may be their best option.  Then again could be completely wrong too.

Recently bought a house here and was going to withdraw some bitcoins for a downpayment.  Mortgage advisor told me to hold off on this to avoid the questions and concerns an underwriter may come across as you're seeing.  Luckily didn't need to cash them out, so had no problem.   Good luck though sure it's causing a few headaches, but you're also paving the way for many in the future!
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:20:10
rational is relative, did you personally perceive bitcoin capable of reaching 1,000 USD on exchanges?  I certainly didn't but part of that is the fact that bitcoin isn't a traditional asset or financial vehicle, so making assumptions and reactions at this point I feel is really far from rational.   Ultimately anyone invested in bitcoin is making a gamble, and sometimes they pay off and other times they don't.

I'm thinking this is standard weekend dip activity due to people not having access to banks over weekends.  This was fairly common pre 260 run up.  I'm holding

I see, I'd suggest looking at BitPay potentially as they can take care of converting a portion or all transactions directly to cash for a small fee.  Their founder gave a good speech at the Philly Bitcoin Summit.   
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:26:32
Usually a bit of both, many don't have access to buy so prices drop, and those selling may be hard up for fiat and need to sell immediately.   This for a while was called the weekend dip, but the past month and a half have skewed it.

Awesome, thanks for posting the new link!   I was getting a little worried they might not have it again this year.

As far as I know there isn't a way to short it.
I think it was a series of events that drove it down, and we're probably not going to know the full story any time soon.  I'm thinking you had the following:
1) Timid new investors with short term investment strategies that were spooked.
2) New money came in with traders who knew what they were doing and intentionally tried to stir up some panic to get a low price.
3) Huge lag driven by either hackers/general traffic following the movements.
Either way, bitcoin fundamentals didn't change and right now rates are at where they were a week ago...sure we're in for many more bumpy days ahead.

It looks like some have been averaging a little under, but even according to BFL's website " 60 GH/s (+/- 10% running variance)" it's operating within that range.   I'm anticipating there'll be some firmware updates that will boost performance some in the upcoming weeks.

Despite several voicing their opinion against posting memes and images - THANK YOU for posting this, I'm sure it saved at least someone from acting irrationally.
Just a reminder to investors: Any gain/loss is unrealized until you decide to sell.  If the price drops $200, you don't have to sell - hold on and it'll probably rise again.  
@_date: 2013-09-18 22:51:10
They figured it'd be tough to value as assets due to the fluctuations in price.  The other question was how to prove what was mine?  I mentioning signing a message from an address, but it didn't seem to hold much weight.  You're probably best converting to USD months ahead of time and moving to bonds or mutual funds to count it for assets.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:11:09
If I was more inclined I'd compare post an image link comparing it to a high/low tide chart, seems to fit that mold.

Agreed, the one week delay is a pain but when the currency exchange rate is stable like its been the past few days its great!
