56,000 tps is the visa network's max throughput.  Visa's avg rate is about 2000 tps and normal very short term peaking is around 20,000 tps.

I will defer to your more correct and less ambiguous description of the bitcoin protocol.  However, I think the intent and spirit of what I said originally was clear enough.  One of the features of bitcoin is that the blockchain can be forked if the community/market wants to adjust the trajectory of bitcoin.  And "consensus"  does not (and should not) imply unanimity in the messy real world.

Unanimity does not necessarily mean the same thing as consensus (  In theory, unanimous agreement would be great, but in the messier real world, more approximate notions are required in order for anything to get done.  Bitcoin was designed as a protocol to define consensus as the longest chain.  I think it is very exciting to see this mechanism at work in practice.

I stand semi-corrected - some stepping in and out is definitely from people conducting multi-party bitcoin transactions, but I suspect that a large fraction of the stepping in and out is just currency trade/investment (i.e. bitcoins don't move between two non-currency-exchange parties).

Armory actually is built on top of bitcoin-qt.  And it provides great offline wallet management and transaction sigining (cold storage) - something that is not so convenient with just bitcoin-qt.

the "&lt;=" was referring to the fact the multiple adresses could belong to the same entity.  It makes sense that exchanges will hold a large fraction of the bitcoin base right now.  Here's to hoping that the bulk eventually shifts toward  people using bitcoin - rather than people stepping in and out of it.

So 30 addresses (&lt;= 30 people/organizations) hold ~10% of all bitcoins.  Seems not so unlike another economy I know ;-)
