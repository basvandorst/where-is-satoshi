This goes for anything. I often ask stores if they have a product as organic and if they say no I will look disappointed and buy it at another store.

I see, it's an interesting thought I have been having too. What is moral? Is something moral because the majority believes it is? It's impossible to find a single point which everyone can agree on. Is moral absolute regardless of opinion? What we consider moral has changed over hundreds and thousands of years, does that mean morals are dynamic?  Not asking you to answer these, but they are mind boggling questions.
And this is what discussing libertarianism always boils down to. "What is moral?"

People have been thinking about this for years. It also implies "any action that causes more good than harm is right". Does that mean a single "wrong" action becomes "right" if the combined product of the action and the effects exceeds the initially bad effect? An example I can come up with now which is somewhat relevant is if I steal some of your money and give it to charity. The stealing in itself is wrong, but the end effect might be more "good" than the stealing is "bad".

What does "trust it" even mean? What am I to trust, that there aren't backdoors in the open source code?

And a final slash at the end? At least sed requires that.

I don't know of any currency that uses SI prefixes. I mean it's time for them to adapt. A millieuro is infinitesimal. But speaking about Megaeuros is more interesting. The thing is that society has already adapted to the concept of "1,000,000 euros", so it's hard to change. But bitcoins are new and what we decide upon now can be impossible to change in the future. The term "mBTC" is already well established thus can't be changed and I say we pronounce it as Millibitcoin.

You were too subtle, I had no idea what you meant by only "FTFY" at first. I know a quote that says something like "if your jokes are so smart that people don't understand them they they think you're dumb". So that's where the initial downvote came from.

As a european, I thought it was 9th june. So two weeks ago.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:32:33
Just to confirm, you believe politicians decide what is moral and that what is moral changes as soon as you step over a country border? Even if it's something like stoning women or atheists for their beliefs? If so I have nothing more to say.

Why do people even sell such things if they would be profitable to own? The fact that people sell "money generators" instead of using it themselves doesn't make any sense. It's like they imply "this is worth less than it can generate".

I know, I have my opinions too and on some points I find it hard to believe that other people think different things. But apparently they do and I can't claim my way is right.

Are you saying politicians are some kind of moral overlords?

But that's just one school of philosophy. It's impossible to prove it being more correct than other schools. At the bottom of the page several more are listed.

Dollars are money because the people perceive it as such. It might as well be toilet paper with a number on it.

Good posts, thanks. However I don't see why we wouldn't be able to live in a tax free society in 500 years as technology improves.

Yeah this infograph probably has many faults based on this and that they claim the cloud to be infinite. I haven't looked up exact numbers but after 5 years you better make sure you have everything backed up from your hard drive. And after 10 years they are likely to have failed? I'm not sure, I've only had one or two fail on me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:09:21
That's just one philosophical ideology which you subscribe to. There are countless others which other people subscribe to. It's impossible to objectively say that one is more "right" or "correct" than another one. I may or may not agree with Utilitarianism. But I can't claim it being "better" than someone else's philosophy. It all boils down to opinions.

I agree with just about everything you say. But is tax really required in a society? Do primitive self-sustaining tribes have some form of tax? If yes, what prevents future ideologies from sustaining without tax?

All the downvotes here sadden me. You both bring up insightful points that contribute to the discussion which is why I am upvoting you both. But the majority of reddit seems to just downvote everything they don't agree with. Please read the [reddiquette]( people...

But you just said I am allowed to do a wrong (harm people) as long as the net effect is positive?

Do you mean he lost all bitcoins who have been donated to him? I want links to read more about it if that's what you mean.

As an European, I like my SI units. We have Meter, Kilometer and Millimeter. It's simply logical for me to call these Millibitcoins. Don't you Americans try to mess up another system of measurement!
We don't say "0.003 meters" because "3 millimeters" is a more reasonable unit.

The piece of paper is physical but it only represents a dollar which is virtual, for lack of a better term. Bitcoin wallets can be printed out on paper too giving them a value equivalent of a dollar, it doesn't make bitcoin physical.
