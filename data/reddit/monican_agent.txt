At this point no, you need to run the game in Adobe's runtimes. I am, however, trying to get a JavaScript implementation underway and would encourage anyone to create their own in whatever runtime and language they prefer.  As long as the implementations can handle the math and can agree on a common way to communicate they can all happily coexist.

As a player (assuming), your feedback is just as, if not more, important!

Thanks for the offer :)
CypherPoker is written in ActionScript for Adobe AIR/Flash so UI rendering is done differently than in HTML. However, I designed it to be more accessible to developers like yourself by rendering the UI from XML. It's not nearly as versatile as HTML5 (or earlier), but hopefully it's enough for now. Keep in mind that the custom rendering engine being used can always be updated with any features (even partially mimicking HTML if desired). Please have a look at the XML definition for the default web version of the CypherPoker game client: 
Specifically, note the &lt;views&gt; node where various views are defined and all of the child nodes defining things like images and UI components. I'd be happy to go into detail on the CypherPoker Slack (visit  to join).
Another possibility is to create a UI-less CypherPoker fork with hooks for JavaScript/HTML integration. Your custom HTML5 UI would call functions (and have functions called from) within the invisible SWF on the page, basically using it as a library for most game functions. Your implementation would be almost entirely focused on the presentation while leaving the logic, networking, Ethereum interaction, etc. to the SWF "library". I think this'd be a really neat hybrid and I'm certain it would work.
If you're still offering then join me on the CypherPoker Slack and let's hammer out the details. A UI-less library SWF could be ready within a day or two and I'd be happy to provide assistance from there.

The CypherPoker implementation of Texas Hold'em can be played for fun here: 
Cryptocurrency integration is happening right now.
I encourage you to follow the project and to some degree ignore the critics if the topic interests you.
There are many seemingly paradoxical concepts at work in any Mental Poker implementation which are not always obvious so skeptics are sometimes quick to dismiss the concepts as impossible or as non-starters. While skepticism is healthy, with Mental Poker it can be followed up with direct proofs or mathematical evidence which I haven't seen yet so I think it's safe to assume that the concept is not only possible but also has good momentum.

The unfortunate thing is that although there are a number of Bitcoin BTMs listed in the area, most are tucked out of sight and have been out of service for a very long time (some for over a year now). The only one I found to be operational is the one at the Starbank convenience store on College but selling Bitcoin there can be pricey. There is a reasonably-priced (for selling) [BTM at Deloitte]( but sadly that one has been out of operation for many months too (plus it's also tucked away on the second floor next to the washrooms and only available during business hours). It's been a few months since I've strolled around the area and maybe things have changed but at the time I found the general neglect to be disheartening. Banners promoting Bitcoin are nice (and this is a fairly prominent location), but I think having more available (and functional), BTMs would be more useful in spreading adoption. My two cents.

This appears to be a symptom of centralization. When they can trace Bitcoin transactions to a central source associated with online gambling then it must be because there are some traceable deposit or withdrawal addresses for them to go by. I'm not saying that I agree with this but it's happening nevertheless.
In a peer-to-peer system like CypherPoker.JS this can be circumvented because new and unrelated deposit / withdrawal addresses can be generated by the peers themselves and there's nothing to tie them to any gaming activity (that's an ephemeral secondary layer). Where centralization is used (for clients who don't want to / can't handle the account / settlement management themselves), the distributed nature of the software means that deposit and withdrawal addresses can pop up and disappear faster than they can be tracked. What I mean is that the services surrounding a game of poker (escrow and game settlement), can be hosted *by anyone* alongside the game client and made available to other players who don't want to / can't host it themselves. Yes, there's some trust implicit in this approach but at least it's broadly distributed.
Furthermore, I'm not a lawyer but I'm fairly certain that (at least in the US), it's perfectly legal to play something like poker for money so long as something like a rake isn't being collected. In a peer-to-peer scenario, any rake or fees can be pretty much eliminated because the game is reduced back to it's original player-versus-player format. If mining fees are collected on the optional game settlement layer (smart contracts employed when everyone doesn't play nice), and when contracts can be just as ephemeral as the games themselves, it should also make tracking such activity nearly impossible.
**Edit:** I know this may come across as a bit plug-y but I honestly can't think of any other peer-to-peer gaming system to use as an example. Clearly, however, we need more!

You may have overlooked the part where I mention that this is peer-to-peer, hence no site or site owner. I mean, there *could* be one but I wouldn't recommend using it for exactly the reasons mentioned in this thread.
There are no groups of addresses because there's no single "point of contact", as it were. Each player can create their own address(es) on their own computer in exactly the same way that native wallet software does, and use the address(es) for game play. To anyone not directly involved in the game it would appear as a deposit (and eventual withdrawal) from an address; that's it.
For players who don't want to or can't do this then yes, there *could* be some centralization involved, but again this needn't be the case since anyone can offer their systems up for address generation / game settlement. To put it another way, if I were to run a single poker site using this software and only use one deposit or withdrawal address then potentially deposits and withdrawals could be traceable. However, deposit addresses are currently generated for each new deposit and could be re-used as withdrawal addresses if they're used for a single game (no one would ever be taking out more than was put in). Even more crucially, because it's peer-to-peer the idea is that for most players there **is no site**, or to put it another way, **players are their own site** and can offer their "site's" services to other players if they want.
When you start up CypherPoker.JS you're not connecting to a website but rather bootstrapping into a P2P network, very much like a Bitcoin client does. Even the web version, though served by a website, bootstraps into a P2P network. All of the gaming (and potentially blockchain) interactions happen through this network, not through the website and the centralization caveat only applies, potentially, *if* one uses the web version. Unlike Bitcoin, however, CypherPoker.JS enables every player to easily create their own network (private or public) that's in no way dependent on any "official" network, and use that to create addresses, games, etc. 
Again, and I can't stress this enough, these would be *independent and entirely unrelated* addresses -- they are generated by a Bitcoin library, not by a site, etc. (in the upcoming version I'm bundling a full Bitcoin client if that helps to clarify things). If players have established their own networks (which involves the literal flick of a switch), they can [send connectivity information]( to fellow players through any secondary channel (Reddit, Twitter, email, discussion forum, whatever). Once all players have left this network it effectively disappears, just as the Bitcoin network would "disappear" if no peers remained. The blockchain data would probably persist, however, in the same was as CypherPoker game data and accounts could be retained by (previously) participating players.

A minor but important point: the GIVE services are intended primarily for public and/or anonymous interactions when you don't know the other players. If you have a known circle of players you can skip the GIVE services altogether - this is the way the software currently works.
Additionally, GIVE will be available to players along with the game software so the distinction between traditional player/provider roles is no longer so clear-cut.

You're the second person to ask for videos so I'll have to add that to my to-do list. Version 0.9 beta is available to play now but players have unlimited balances and there is no dropout support.
Regarding JavaScript and WebRTC, this is something I had suggested a number of times. ActionScript and JavaScript are both in my repertoire and the cryptosystem borrows heavily from a public domain, large integer math library written in JavaScript.
ActionScript has broader functionality and is currently somewhat more secure but a JavaScript port is something I would like to attempt in the future. I would also encourage anyone else to give it a try. From my perspective there's no reason why the two implementations couldn't communicate using some shared network protocol.
It's my hope that most people don't need software installs with Flash. With desktop or mobile versions this seems unavoidable. Mobile web with JavaScript and HTML5 would work but devices will need to have more processing power added if they're to be used to play reasonably secure games. I've found that roughly 512 bits (64 CBL) is the maximum I could squeeze out of my older Android device without making the startup wait intolerable. With planned optimizations this will improve significantly but there is still a point at which some devices will struggle. Your device's available processing power determines your maximum security.
Bitcoin Lightning sounds interesting but until we have a working and tested implementation it's best to focus on something more established and immediate such as bitcoind. I certainly won't discount it for future integration.
Thanks for your feedback.

If anonymity is being provided through something like Tor then each player would use a unique .onion address. If the addresses are not changed between sessions we can simply record them and try to re-connect for future games.
To connect players who don't know each others' .onion addresses we would use a public introduction service (directory) where new players would register their presence and find others. Along with this service we could verify completed games, provide cryptocurrency escrow, run deeper game analyses for player reputation rankings, collusion detection, and so on. These are technically centralized services but because anyone will have the ability to run them they are effectively decentralized.

Cryptography is used to detect cheating but it's not hash-based like the blockchain. It's an implementation of the original SRA cryptosystem described in "Mental Poker".

It's possible to play a private game over the internet with some minor modifications to the existing code. Please let me know if this is something you'd like to try and I'll provide a step-by-step.

Hello Market-Anarchist,
I went dark for a while to allow me to concentrate on the final leg of this first release.
When I was anticipating the amount of work I would reasonably be able to do I neglected to include a key component, the poker hand analyzer, and I underestimated the complexity of the betting system. In my defense, this is the farthest that any such project has gotten so I'm walking in foreign lands. 
The project is made up of concurrent server and client code, written with a view to assist other developers for future extensions, so it's a tricky path to tread. I should also point out that I'm adding comments to as much of the source code as possible and updating the Wiki in GitHub. 
I understand that there's a lot of material to go over, and there's more to come, so I would recommend starting with the CypherPoker subreddit: 
I very recently posted the "Midnight" series which should provide a layman's introduction to CypherPoker and its foundations. If you wish to continue your exploration I recommend the "building blocks" post for a deeper and more technical look.
Finally, thank you for your concern. I'll try to check in more regularly in the future!

The video is now available:

I've completed uploading the v1.0b source code so over the next few days I'll be putting together a video on how to compile a custom build for completely private games (you'll just have to share your custom build with your fellow players). It's not an elegant solution but it'll let you test out the software under much more "real world" conditions without too much work.
I'll post additional info and the link on the CypherPoker subreddit when the video's ready:
