That's what the Cypriots also said.

If you made it all the way down to Colombia hitchhiking and sleeping next to roads I'd say you're one lucky person.

Thanks for the input, but to us Bitcoin is not a "product". We're using both logos at our office and never had any issues with it. Out of the hundreds of customers in roughly 6 months, no one has complained. 
For a unique logo/brand we have our own company logo.
Calling a Bitcoin logo a "faggot logo" is not a very sound argument.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:58:17
If that is confusing you then good luck understanding/explaining Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:50:48
Very true, it should be a voluntary decision. In 9 out of 10 cases I'd choose Bitcoin over a credit card when paying for something online.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:16:38
Yes, I'm aware of that. My first language ain't English either but some mistakes just hurt my eyes and I can't resist the urge to correct.

I have no idea how a Robocoin withdraw works, our customers mostly want to acquire BTC for cash and that's what we offer them. Have you ever lifted a Lamassu machine? I'd invite you to visit our shop and "run" out of the door with it, but it's bolted to a custom-made stand which in turn is bolted to the wall.

I lived in Taipei from 2008 to 2011 and probably spent half of my time at convenience stores drinking beer and eating those delicious rice triangles. The 711 next to Roxy 99 is famous. Good times.

Guess they meant to say German as in the language.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:48:57
You can sell your BTC for cash on a Lamassu with the extra stand. Costs you another 5k though, too much in my opinion. I think BitXatm looks promising.

In Graz.
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:51:51
That's one fugly UI. We've been running 2 different Lamassu ATMs for months now and only once did a customer not receive his BTC even though the machine ate all his EUR bills. That was a network connectivity issue. I opened the machine, returned the cash and on the second run everything went fine. We yet have to stumble across a customer that would actually complain about not receiving his money's worth.

They certainly don't "effect" anything.
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:32:36
No idea what your're trying to get at, can't follow your inane chain of arguments. I'm one of the guys running that store btw.
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:50:12
Why would they? It's an Austrian business. VAT changes on 1/1/2015 could be a more pressing issue.

The libertarian view holds that you and you only are the proper owner of your own physical body.
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:05:43
Very true.
@_date: 2014-10-25 21:22:13
I guess you didn't understand the concept of decentralization.
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:30:19
Are you referring to Hoppe?
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:03:38
Now where can I get that shirt? Preferably for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:45:38
Yup, "erhälst" ist mir auch zweimal untergekommen.

Old quote. He said that at SF CoinSummit (fireside chat).

What are these currencies backed with?
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:54:52
You're contradicting yourself, maybe check your previous comments again. USA, Russia, EU or math? Math.

I'm one of the guys running bitcoinsofortkaufen.com and I can feel your pain. As a result we had to completely revamp our service and currently due to uncertainties regarding the new MOSS VAT regulation also decided to stop selling to customers in Germany. Edit: typo 
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:25:25
Exactly my thoughts.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:26:17
None out of those four is backed with gold. Time for a reality check.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:38:27
Faith is something imaginary. How many countries that have been around for centuries can boast a fiat currency existing for centuries? I'm curious, since the average life span of a fiat currency is just 27 years. But maybe I missed something.
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:13:32
Tell me one currency that's not imaginary.

Last time I checked livestock was a commodity.

Yes. She also seems quite active in the libertarian scene.
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:49:34
Anarcho-communism would only mean the formation of a class controlling redistribution or enforcement of non-property. Call this class what you want, e.g. bureaucrats and it just means rulers all over again. Therefore I don't think anarcho-communism is anarchism at all. Then again, ask an anarcho-communist and he'll say exactly the same about ancapism.

Looks like you caught a trojan somewhere before visiting the site.

Being vigilant is good, but maybe you should start being vigilant elsewhere? Also, try and run a full scan of coinfinity.co on Quterra. Here are the results I just got:

Here in Graz there's quite a few stores and restaurants already accepting Bitcoin.
