Ah, good catch. I'll add this in when I get to a computer

Li Ka-Shing is kind of like China's Donald Trump, except his net worth is 10x Trump's

It is not rooted, and no one has handled the phone except myself all day (all week actually). 
Although it has been acting a little odd lately..doing a lot of stuff in my pocket. Mostly with the music/podcast player (would start/stop), also trigger a voice call when the screen's still locked (I'd hear the TTS voice asking me to say the number I wish to dial)  
And holy crap you were right, "Report Issue" triggered the exact same result - a bunch of log files were sent. There was an unchecked checkbox asking if I wanted to send the wallet dump as well...so I had to have pocket-checked that too. What are the chances of that o_o

Nexus 5 with Skype installed

I'm quite intrigued.  
How did you find your assistant?  
What duties does she perform?  
What's a typical salary range for a Filipino assistant?  
What, if any, are your tax obligations?

Couldn't find a credible source for that
@_date: 2014-07-29 03:17:14
Thank you for your response!  
The files were sent by me. I don't remember who the other guy is, I think he's a friend of a friend.  
Shit, I guess it was sent from my Android phone, I do have both Skype and some empty wallets on there..  
edit: It was indeed being sent from my Android!
Nothing seems to have actually been sent thought, everything was pending. (holy shit Skype makes it incredibly difficult to cancel a file transfer, the hitbox is 12 pixels high)

Yikes, good catch. I'll delete the article.
@_date: 2014-03-19 05:25:16
Good point, done :)
@_date: 2014-07-29 05:57:02
I'm inclined to believe it was a "pocket dial". 
The guy it was being sent to was certainly a friend of a friend, haven't spoken in years but was a good dude, not that tech savvy iirc. Doesn't make sense to send it to him (he didn't accept any of the file transfer either, told me he was worried I was sending *him* a virus). If it was a virus it would make more sense to use email attachments
False alarm?
Kind of scary that it's that easy (well, maybe not that easy, but easy enough) to accidentally send a wallet to someone else. Should have been a password prompt in there somewhere..

Not at all, might consider adding to it some of the other commenters suggestions as well

Chinese do have their own twitter(s).

That's awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:47:37
That's odd. I'm seeing it now, but as you can see from my screenshot 7 minutes ago, that notice was \*not\* there, and it was certainly not there when I purchased it on the 17th  
edit: just finished reading it, says the limit was reached just 1 minute ago.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:39:32
I'm slightly confused. Does your statement mean bitcoin news will be so prevalent that it can't possibly be his last post on it (you'd be correct, he made [another post]( just a few weeks after that), or do you not agree with what he said and are glad he won't be spouting off more? 
I actually thought it was elucidating and sent it to a few friends who wondered why rational people might want to invest in a bubble. I used to say it was because "the bubble could become self-sustaining" and that was the best I could come up with.

Stores would be holding a lot of exchange rate risk right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:39:13
Thank you for the information. I'm still interested in buying more coins but am reluctant due to not being sure what exchange rate they'll be sold at. Could you do me a favor and screencap where the message you quoted is located? This is what I see on my purchase screen ATM, and I don't see any notices regarding their buy limit issue.   
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:55:29
Just saw the limit was reached at 7:48. I wonder if I could have had the tab open before the limit was reached and finished the transaction afterwards on the 17th? Thanks again for your help and screenshot, cleared a lot of things up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:59:33
np, thanks for setting a noob's mind at ease.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:59:29
OMG MY FIRST BITCOINS!! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:35:39
Thanks, I was (and still am) uncertain because it says the transaction is stated to be pending, and no money has been withdrawn. Doesn't that mean it could be canceled at any time?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:40:14
Thank you, that's a relief
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:45:25
They don't have any support besides email, they don't say how long it'll take for them to respond, could be days. I tried searching online and in reddit but the only cases I've seen were delays of [hours]( but a guy from Coinbase responded that they're fixed it, but that was a month ago. I'm sorry if I polluted your subreddit but I honestly don't know where else I could ask this.
