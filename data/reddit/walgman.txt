Mine is at 23% currently. I'm financially down but I'm confident and calm and above all I didn't panic sell. I'm also still happy to own my bitcoin. 
Luckily I'm away in Bangkok with the Mrs so there were large periods of time I was distracted yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:42:34
I'll be happy to hold all your bets until the months end. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:56:38
I've often bought cheaply and easily there. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:52:04
Mid November and I've heard nothing. Gave up on the fuckers. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:38:36
I'm down too and I've slowly stopped caring. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:27:17
I thought an order on the book represented all the individual orders at that price and not necessarily a single buyer. Could be wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:45:16
What games are you playing. I'm 120 hours into Zelda, 35 into SMO, 20 into rocket league and most surprisingly I'm playing skyrim mostly. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:56:59
Which is what happens anyway?
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:03:32
Thing is bitcoin and any other investments (which BTC is to many of us) are always a series of what ifs? What if I had bought then? What if I had sold then? What if I hadn't bought that pizza?
I'd be very surprised if most of us here didn't think like this sometimes. Hell I bet even warren buffet thinks it sometimes. I know I thought about it a lot but generally I forget within a few days and wait for the next fuck up. It's like women in that respect. 
I'm sure you already know this and I know you were getting it off your chest by sharing it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:14:57
Who's going to invest on a clear prolonged downward slope?
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:04:14
It's just a link to the app. 
Revolut is a pre paid card which gives you pretty much bank rate and without fee on loads of currencies. 
They added BTC recently but you can't transfer your BTC to another address which means they are holding it. However they are an FCA institution which means they are probably pretty safe. 
Us Brits can use the card as a euro bank account to withdraw from gdax and then transfer to gdp without fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:30:53
I understood you. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:09:06
I did that this week. Same day for me. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:50:00
How has he managed that? I'm a relative newcomer and I've been trading the last few weeks. I'm currently down on my initial investment but I've increased my stock of BTC. This time I'm hodling. I've panic sold before and lost. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:21:08
So a paper wallet is just a private key and you can enter this into a software wallet and your BTC will appear ready to use?
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:13:04
From memory. Press home. Then your Mii or icon or whatever it's called top left to get your play activity. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:41:22
Me too. +6% in a few hours. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:40:56
What's smarter though. Selling yesterday would have been a smarter move than holding right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:18:15
Yes thanks. I worked it all out last night and I'm waiting for confirmation from coinbase. They didn't except nationwide and it took two months before I worked out why.
This is perfect for me and revolut offer as near as dammnit perfect exchange. The air gap suits me too. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:19:23
I've done this a few times no problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:30:27
And how many people will consider this before investing in the first place. I don't think I would invest in something which is going down. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:46:54
I don't recall needing any additional information to switch from coinbase to gdax. 
Also you can send your BTC from GDAX to a wallet without fees. I've been doing this in small amounts over the past week. Send 0.25 and that's what you receive in your wallet. 
Got to say I've enjoyed my little bit if trading on gdax and I've made some modest profits. I've just been setting a buy limit and waiting for a fill and then a sell limit 500 - 1000 above and waiting. It usually sails past your limit either way leaving you wondering what you've done but at the end of each cycle you've made 500 - 1000. Anyway my BTC is in a wallet now so I'm hodling for a good while. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:36:35
Holding is what got you in this position in the first place. 
Me too. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:30:36
I initially did the opposite to that. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:11:27
I've been trading for the past few weeks. Although the value usually soars past the limit I set because I'm not an oracle, I have managed to increase my stock by a modest amount. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:24:11
I've since discovered the problem here. My uk bank is not accepted. I'll try again when I'm back in england with an account that is. 
I received a reply after two weeks saying they would look into it then crickets. If I weren't on this forum I wouldn't know though. 
I used localbitcoins in the end and transferred my balance to gdax where I have been dabbling in a little trading with varying success. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:00:35
Happened to me. 
I called my mate who's a trader. He just sighed and said rookie mistake. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:51:27
Me too. I've had reasonable success trading but selling out on the way down has ended in tears twice. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:09:45
Yeah. At first I thought the sky's had caved in but now I'm having fun and optimistic. Although I've got a lot of money invested it was sitting idle in another place anyway. It's not changed my life in any way. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:52:18
Who takes the fees? Sorry for the noob question?
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:55:16
For me it's been slightly worse. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:15:22
What about mobile wallets like bread?
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:39:59
I had the same problem. 
1. Get a revolut card which is also excellent for travelling. 
2. Set up a euro account. Deposit €2 to coinbase. 
3. Withdraw to revolut and convert to £ at bank rate and without fees. 
I haven't done 3 yet although I've read it here as legitimate. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:29:51
I use transferwise. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:21:14
I missed it this time. Now I'm definitely a hodler. I'm taking my BTC off the exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:28:20
Even then reset it right?
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:46:58
Yeah me too. Whenever I've panic sold before it's been at the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:19:42
I bought most of mine from localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:48:08
My mrs told me to sell then. Actually everything she's told me has been right to my often wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:43:55
Do you think these scares and bitcoin levelling and rising each time are just giving it strength? I've certainly been panicking less and less each time. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:12:36
Almost definitely. I'dsay they were lucky to get that. I've got an open ticket two months old. People were saying here they are waiting replies from last summer. I've moved everything off gdax. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:25:18
How do I create a euro wallet and link it to coinbase account? 
Edit. So is it as easy as following the instructions [here]( 
And then linking that to coinbase?
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:39:56
Is this the same as Forex trading?
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:51:53
As the most fun part of my savings.
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:58:40
Nano S. They got so cheap and these wallets were highly recommend here.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:33:52
I used BRD for a year with zero problems. I've gone cold storage now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:07
Its gone this high. It's unlikely to never reach that high again. People know that and there are enough people interested to buy in the dips. That's my line of thinking.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:13
It's horrible isn't it. I've jumped out at a loss earlier and it was the right move so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:55:28
On the logic that the current curve is strongly upwards?
As a relative noob I have panic sold twice now. Once I bought in at a higher price and once a lower. Neither time was worth the stress. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:11:26
Cheers mate. It's night here. I'm on my third. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:42:04
People will always make money on currency trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:41:56
Got to learn to ignore the regrets and what ifs. I'm trying. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:44:03
Whats that based on?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:50
Does anyone else find this a bit fishy?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:57:35
You still got the computer? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:12:59
Trading but no fluctuations in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:05:03
Lol. Not so sure about that. I've made and lost money holding and trading. It's certainly easier on the hair line to hold in general although this time I'm glad I unloaded. As long as most of your choices are ok I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:48:49
Hodling is crazy advice when the curve is downwards and pronounced. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:55:33
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:41
I'm watching mine fluttering by a weeks wages in the time it takes to have a piss. I kind of wish I wasn't involved because my life's become a series of what ifs, minor panics and euphoria. I have a lot invested but I can afford to loose it so I'm taking the advice here.  hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:47:36
Thanks I'll try tonight on my laptop. 
I tried two separate uk bank accounts. Both in my name but they said they didn't match my driving licence which is also in my name but included my middle name which my accounts dont so I wonder if it's that. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:36:09
I don't really get hodling during a prolonged downward trend. 
I've had a little luck buying in at around £10.5k and selling at £11k recently but generally I keep my money out. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:16:43
I rode that one too. It's all ups and downs and what ifs! I only had 6 back then. Bought and sold and forgot. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:18
Fuck. I nearly bottled it when it went under £10k. Now its risen again. Thank fuck I took everyones advice and HODLed. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:46:49
This is exactly why I come to reddit. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:59:46
Didn't speak to the bank at all because I eventually got a reply from coinbase. I was under the impression that they would sort it out but I was wrong. Then this thread. It's almost not worth bothering about but I blame coinbase. Their customer service is dire. I'll be looking for alternatives. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:51
Really get out. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:51:49
Good luck getting a reply. I've waited two weeks, got a reply to say they were looking into it and nothing for two more weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:01:48
Yep. I've panic sold before a few times and lost big. Holding would have certainly been better advice then. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:57
Thanks for explaining. It's happened several times today to me and the app even signs me out. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:25:02
Fair enough. We all have major what ifs with bitcoin. Hell we have what ifs every few hours. 
It's only the lucky few who've made serious money. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:03:27
Thanks a lot. I've been interested for ages. Recent investor and I have to admit fairly ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:43:44
I'm alright. It was a small amount but it's a regular thing to hear of people with £10k in the ether. The worry would keep me awake at night. Poor sods. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:03:43
This. And don't beat yourself up. Have a fucking beer and forget it. To be punting money on bitcoin in the first place means your one of life's lucky ones. To have a girlfriend too is more than many redditors. 
TLDR. When you fuck up concentrate on the good things. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:27
No but I was going to do the same thing from gdax and it warned me that transactions are delayed. 
 
I'm a newbie but I'd guess at this being your issue. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:23:35
Mine was dated 20th November. Still nothing. Coinbase has my money. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:04:10
Thats exactly how I see it too. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:19:21
Lost too. Although not me this time. Holding was wise, thanks to this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:31:24
You guys have made me feel better about missing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:03:48
This happened to me months ago now. Total under £40 but coinbase eventually got back to me saying they were looking into it. I've given up on them. 
Still good to know the reason at last. I'm usually principalled and fight to get my money back but dealing with coinbase isn't worth the pain. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:17:27
There haven't been many days this fortnight you won't have lost money. Dont get me wrong I've regretted not holding a few times but not this time. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:42:21
 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:23:37
My gdax says I need to fund my coinbase account first. 
Coinbase wont verify my uk bank account. Their customer service is goddam awful too. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:01:55
Only you can make up your mind. The curve is headed upwards at the moment and has been for a while. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:39:12
What were your trades yesterday? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:40:07
I bought at last week's peak and I've made a grand on that money. Although I could have made nearly three times that if I had followed your advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:12:23
We hit the £10,000 this evening. What...A week after you hit the $10,000?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:05:17
From nationwide. Mine transferred, coinbase refused on a technicality and never gave me my money back. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:22:20
Is net neutrality definitely dead in America now?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:37:42
Yeah. I understand that too although I'm pro neutrality. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:52:15
I bought a chunk yesterday and it's increased by only 14%. I'm gutted. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:02:56
To each his own. If you bought high and sold low over the last three days you'd have made a lot of money. 
Easier said than done I hasten to add. 
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:38:19
Ive been using pro to do a little trading and to send out to my cold storage but not actually for buying. I will now.
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:12:56
Thanks a lot. I'm on it now.
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:42:36
I'm happy if it goes up and happy if it goes down.
@_date: 2019-08-04 08:43:25
Within a month or two you'll have lost some too. Just keep hodling and putting a little away. You won't go wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:14:37
How do you get your funds into coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-10-11 09:23:31
That’s it. Never again.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:05:00
Oh. I imagined you wearing white tiger fur for a minute. Perhaps with a silver tipped cane.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:06:35
If you doubled my life savings I wouldn't have to work again.
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:43:18
Yeah but I've bought some more since, so although I'm still down it will come back. I bought loads of lightcoins and I'm back in profit there. Not enough BTC but I'm nearly there with them. I have strong faith.
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:18:01
I found myself 80% down by not holding and panicing. Settled down. Bought small amounts and now I'm in striking range of even. 
Same kind of figures but my majority savings are spread around very safe institutions earning little per year but they are earning.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:11:46
Yeah. Looks pretty good to me. 
I was using mobile wallets for a few years until recently.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:43:51
Which online wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-02 09:37:17
I'm no economist but if nobody sold I doubt it would have much value.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:49:04
You could use a wallet app on your phone for amounts like that.
@_date: 2019-06-02 22:32:05
Did you use it?
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:37:21
I'm nearly 50 mind you. Wanna retire at 55. I need to keep my calm and I can.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:49:28
Drinking with a wall St guy last night and he blames all of it on shorting. People making money off it still. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:47:01
Hard though isn't it. I've just bought a 4 pack of beer to see me through. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:33:55
Well. Mine didn't match because of my middle name originally but I had zero issues with revolut. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:38:37
They have a small percentage of middle class and an even smaller percentage of rich. Small percentages in India are a lot of people. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:22:33
If they believe the price has a lot further to fall then they should sell. Holders believe it will eventually go back up. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:13:58
You’re doing the right thing. Many beginner’s, myself included, shat themselves when they saw their first crashes and some, also including myself panic sold.
@_date: 2019-09-15 13:51:16
I did that once and after that started using proper software with a colour coded diary system which i manage myself.
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:40:33
I preferred giving them my dong.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:44:04
I meant my car. I haven't got a lambo and never will. 
I went in one years ago. A spectacular diablo. I was totally embarrassed from the second I got in it and relieved when I got out and walked away. Great. Fun. Amazing but everyone looking at you wasn't for me.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:28:21
I stopped worrying after that.
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:38:04
Some months. I have already invested what I can afford to loose.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:51:00
I was really asking about probate after death when ones will becomes a public document. Here in the UK anyway. 
Personally speaking, as it stands. I've got two copies of seeds hidden in two separate houses but that's really it. I've got no family closer than a cousin. Maybe I could ask her and do something similar to you.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:08:57
What if they die and do wills have to go on public record before their execution? 
I'm 50 next year and I've started a will. The question of my bitcoins is one I haven't yet been able to answer.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:37:11
Aren't they strictly dual clutch computer controlled manuals. Mine is.
Edit. My ford focus.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:59:56
Will there be a day when computers can do that in a second?
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:45:29
Did you have any gains at any point?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:53:34
Isn't this like publicly saying I only take cash? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:07:10
Good point. I'm facepalming as I type. Hard not to blag your taxes when it's cash though eh? I certainly do. I don't advertise it to 1000s of followers though. Just reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:09:20
It's gonna go lower than $300.
