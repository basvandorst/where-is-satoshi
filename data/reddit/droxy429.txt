I agree with you that it's in the fear stage on the return to the moving average. 50-period average is around $5,000. 
I'm all for Crypto, and have some. But, I'm also a realist and look at things objectively and not emotionally. The extraordinary deviation from the long-term moving average was bound to revert.

Monero does have a choice, they're called view keys.

Your post is literally about the value of your BTC in USD.

In this case, your institutional investors are the creators of Coinbase, Kraken, Winklevoss twins, etc.
Most people have heard of bitcoin at this point after all the media attention. Those who have bought to prop up the price have done so. You can download multiple apps and purchase with credit card which allowed the public to purchase bitcoin. "Public phase" doesn't mean a majority of the public has purchased.

There are a ton of crypto scams on Facebook. Pretty sure that's the motivating factor.

But if a currency gains spending power rather than lose spending power, it only helps the people who held that currency earlier. Additionally, it encourages holding a currency rather than using it as a medium of exchange for goods and services which is necessary for a functioning economy.
oh wait...

Doesn't bitcoin fit this definition?

I'm a supporter of crypto, I own a few coins different coins and mine Monero. I feel this needs to be said on this sub, so you don't think I'm trying to spread FUD. I'm trying to sell a more balanced mindset.
Yes, I'm very aware of inflation which is an intentional part of our monetary system. If the purchasing power of your dollar increased every day, you would never spend it and there would be no economy! Aside from high fees, this is why many people would rather hold their bitcoin than spend it. "It's going to be worth more in the future! I can only buy a Honda Civic today, but if I wait I can buy a Lambo!"
Second, while checking and savings accounts which pay interest are a form of investment, at least according to tax law, it's the worst possible investment. You cannot discredit saving in fiat with the worst possible investment vehicle. You would be way better off purchasing shares of the bank, rather than putting cash in an interest-bearing account.
Using TD Bank as an example, shares in 1996 were $5 and now are $60. Including the time of the financial crisis. You would also receive quarterly dividends. The current dividend is $.50 per quarter. So today you could be making $2 per share, per year on your $5 per share investment 22 years ago.
