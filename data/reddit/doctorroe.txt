You need to wait the full 30 days before your transactions are immediate.  They want to make sure that the coins that you buy will not be changed by you going to your bank and disputing the transaction.  Once they *trust* you, your transactions are immediate (5-10 minutes).

To mine LTC or BTC?
Here is a start ...

Wow, the poor guy was just asking for an opinion.  In my .02btc, I think that it is worth buying, say .5 btw and seeing if it returns back to $1000.  if so, you made 20% on your money.  :-)

Good for you!  It makes me feel good when people are happy with the trade results.

It will correct and, quite possibly, down to the 550-600 range or lower.  Just have the *gun* loaded with $$ and get ready to beat the message that there is not enough BTC to cover all the buy orders.  :-)

That is also why I mine.  The processing of the Block Chain IS important to the success of BTC.  I am also creating an LTC mining rig at this point as the decreasing difficulty now makes it somewhat profitable.

My hardware was $1500. I am generating 60gh/s. I am a member of a pool that pays me .045 per day. Made my ROI an now generating 1 but  every 30 days. Been mining for 6 months. You do the math. :-)

Read the multivitamin support page. It will tell you how to fix.

The export feature generates just a report of the area that you are exporting.  It does not *remove* anything.

That will be in 2140. Not too concerned about it now.
