Indeed I did not say that :P  
I said "do not get greedy", which means take profits from time to time :P

If  fiat is air, and with fiat you buy gold, then gold is air?  
Your assumption just does not make sense
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:07:15
I said "don't trade it", not "don't take profits". I surely wish profits to everybody here!

To all the critics,
You buy because it's a scarce asset and you know that it will store its value overtime.
  
And, YES, BTC  CAN BE COPIED. You cannot however copy the hash rate and the Community it got in 10 years.  
Bitcoin is money from the people, for the people.  
You can change bitcoin yes, but it's fking hard, you need to convince :  
\-miners, to mine your new currency;  
\-Full nodes, to run your software (blockchain);  
\-users, to use your new currency;  
You can copy the bitcoin code, but you will not copy Bitcoin.   
I am not a magician, I cannot see the future. This is what I can say today. Just by judging the facts.
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:24:02
Indeed that's smart :)
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:44:23
yeah we had silk road
@_date: 2019-11-02 11:40:38
These are the realities where the btc would have his real implications.  
Good luck to these people, I hope the best for them.

Look for the transition there

Welcome !!1111!!!   
You are the classic person that invested 500 euro when btc was at 9k and sold at 15k making 800 euro profit. 
GO buy some weed kid and have fun :)
@_date: 2019-11-10 09:46:51
is there a video of it?
@_date: 2019-10-09 10:58:38
They do actually. As long as Central Banks can print money.
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:59:41
lol. thanks god we have ppl like you here &lt;3
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:31:31
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:27:20
ath :)
@_date: 2019-10-10 11:53:30
Totally true, but the hashing power would decrease a lot if BTC drops to 1 cent. No hashing power = Easy to crack network
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:23:44
Dollar cost average dude. Good luck :)
@_date: 2019-10-09 07:00:17
Thanks for sharing you thoughts, nice answer

thanks buddy

If the name you used to register is credible, get one on the deep.  I AM JOKING
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:24:26
lol I don't want to spread any FUD. If you investing in BTC you should understand all the aspects of it, this is why I love Reddit, here I can find some smart people I can talk to.
If you do not want to think and you just want to "believe" then please, we already have Christ and Father Christmas :P
Much love
@_date: 2019-10-08 13:10:29
Cuz btc is not interesting at all for them (imo)
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:42:55
Even worse than "not committed". The can just bail in
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:00:02
Buddy that's so unlucky. Just try to fake it, at this point I think it's the only thing you have. Or you find a person with the name and surname you used and  offer some money to borrow his ID (this is gonna be really tough though).
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:01:27
they can accumulate over the counter and drop coins in the market. Why do you think I don't know what I am talking about? Can you please explain your opinion instead of just being mean?
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:14:33
Sure bro :) Just send me 1 btc, and I will immediately send you two: 37GgfFTLCfuMzrEXZTxKz4VN2aB5nJRLnF

LeL is someone buying alts in 2019?
@_date: 2019-10-08 08:52:16
why should I do so?
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:29:21
You will lose the BTC you have in Bitmex forever probably.
Do you remember the fake email that you used to register? If yes, can you try to disable and recreate it?
Can you recover it?  
What provider did you use to create the email address?
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:10:15
thought the same! Who is using that coin? o.o
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:40:41
What concerns me, are the volumes.
If you notice, after 2016 we never saw high volumes. We had a huge parabolic rise (from 230 usd to 20k) without the same volumes we had before.
I am an hodler, but I do not like that at all
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:00:36
Easy for them to accumulate then dump. They can accumulate over the counter then drop 'em the market.

Find a post on cryptogrind.com where the guys was asking to do some stuff to get btc. I did it then I told me to subscribe to a site so that he could send me btc. He sent me btc on the website then the website itself asked me .2 btc in order to withdraw. And I sent them. I wanna fucking cry I’m feeling an idiot. I will go to the police although I know it won’t solve the issue
@_date: 2019-12-05 20:24:37
-2000 to be precise
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:52:51
I will fucking buy back the 0.2 btc that I stupidly sent to that son of a slut. Then will bury my wallet somewhere so that I cannot touch it. I hope he will spend those btc in medicine.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:52:51
watch out dude, those sites are full of scams
@_date: 2019-12-06 11:16:49
I am still talking to the guy by the way, using another account. He knows it's me.
"Can you turn your brain on and understand we are not located in xxxxxxx(EU Country)   and even EU?"
I tried to trace his IP and dive into the html of the website and it looks like he is in Ohio (USA) although it's possibile that he moved his ip.
5 Bitcoin if you give me the name.
