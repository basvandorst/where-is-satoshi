It will be a whole lot of nothing. I've done this with a few of the Craigslist scammers.
 In case anyone doesn't know, they contact you about something you have for sell, and then they send you a "check"  and they put in a little extra for the shipping. When the bogus check or money order arrives it will be anywhere between double the asking price to four times the price. You're supposed to deposit the check , ship the item and the extra minus your shipping cost. In two weeks when the clearing house refuses the check they get their money back from your account and now you're out the money plus the item you shipped. As the OP said none of that happens with Bitcoin so the scammers just drop it when you go there with them.

Most 401k's allow you to take out a loan. It's not a withdrawal so no tax hit. You pay it back like any other loan but the interest you pay goes into your account, so you're paying yourself. there are some drawbacks, if you leave the job the 401k is with the loan changes to a withdrawal and then you do pay the tax penalty. Also you miss out on any gain you would have had if that money were still in your account. 
I don't think I would suggest anyone do this, but it is an option.

I kind of feel bad for OP, but another part of me wants to just say "well duh!"

I got that email this past weekend, dumped straight into the spam folder. My wife made the comment that anyone savvy enough to get into bitcoin shouldn't fall for anything like that. I told her I wished that was true.

As long as you're not planning on leaving that job before the loan is repaid I don't see too much of a downside. As for you plans for a second loan, many plans don't allow for more than one at a time unless you can prove hardship. So keep that in mind.

Not true, some / most people love their Mom, I don't know anyone who loves their bank.
