This story us all over the default subreddits.  It's a good opportunity to open peoples' eyes to alternatives.

Dogecoiners are always saying stuff like this and presenting this goofy, fun, affable image.  Then they spam and vote brigade their bullshit all over Reddit like Jehovah's Witnesses pushing the latest Watchtower.  
As for the *huge success* of your memecoin, I checked the charts today on Cryptsy.  You've been flat against the bitcoin all through our downhill slide.
Edit:  Big ups on the multidoge wallet, though.  I wish something like this existed for some of the actually innovative coins.
Edit   Keep bringing the downvotes.  Much butthurt.  Very mad.

Why indeed?  In an ideal society, machines would perform most of the drudgery.

I might have just gotten lucky but I got three nonsense questions that had nothing to do with anything plus one question that made some sense.  I answered the sensible questions and guessed at the other three and got verified.

Yes.  I just checked, they're all out.

I'm using Coinbase, so yeah... really no choice but to adopt a buy &amp; hold strategy with those jokers.

Sky sold separately.

OK, no need to shout at me, dude.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:37:15
Oh, how con*veee*nient.

The "mean" in this case would be about $400?  I am OK with this.
