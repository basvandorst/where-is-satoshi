Man that gold was too easy
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:08:25
I'm still waiting for the two deposits to confirm my bank account...
@_date: 2019-01-08 03:14:20
It’s a vibe 
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:05:12
I'm gonna wait until August to consider buying. It'll be my first time. Gonna watch for now.
@_date: 2013-05-27 23:29:35
Go Bitminter!
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:22:39
So what's the best way to make money off this? Buy facebook stock? Buy bitcoins? Mine bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:41:43
So, if I made a new Electrum wallet with a new seed could I just import certain addresses I want? And, how do I know whether I export the address from the old wallet to the new one or to import it from the new one?
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:52:51
I've heard it's risky and messy to export and import private keys.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:47:42
Yeah. Well, that narrows it down. I guess we can still continue to figure out why my coins aren't showing up in my wallet on this thread.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:25:54
I did. I asked what the best way to keep my coins but delete my old wallet was. This was on another post. And I asked in the IRC chat.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:47:00
What do you mean how recently? It's been a day since I entered in my address and clicked the button.
@_date: 2013-05-31 18:12:27
1. Yes 
2. I don't.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:46:17
I'm wondering all the websites I went to happen to be out of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 21:51:04
Sweet! I'm going to install it and send my coins now.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:48:03
Oh. Well that's probably not the case then.
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:06:55
So what are the differences between the Qt wallet and others. And why are these differences present? Also, would you suggest electrum?
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:39:20
Oh wow. Then why do some of the free bitcoin websites say that there is a fee?
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:21:41
Do you think it would have let me import my bitcoin-qt wallet's address and private key? Electrum uses brainwallets.
@_date: 2013-05-30 21:50:41
Wait, so what's the difference between an online wallet and a "lite" wallet?
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:57:07
I'll back it up when I get home to my external hard drive.
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:58:52
Yes, the blocks. So how exactly would I send my BTC to an electrum wallet address?
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:14:03
... No?
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:19:01
I could have done that? Why didn't anyone ever suggest that?
@_date: 2013-06-01 16:12:24
It now has 143 confirmations.
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:32:24
So will it ever be verified?
@_date: 2013-07-07 15:40:13
Yeah... I've been watching the bitcoin price for months now on MtGox and all it's done is go down.
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:15:18
How do you recreate the wallet within the seed?
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:50:54
Yep, that's what it did to me.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:39:17
Well, I heard one guy on this subreddit's IRC say that bitcoins are a really bad investment and that you will lose money.
@_date: 2013-05-31 11:56:56
Ah. So should I wait until i have a decent amount of coins before I use another address? Also, how would I add a new one, not that I want to?(I have 6 now because I reinstalled Electrum so I could get the GUI verison)
@_date: 2013-06-01 13:46:31
I think the minimum for the gap limit is 1.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:09:51
Oh ok. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:55:51
Well, I didn't choose to have 5 addresses. It gave me 5 default addresses when I installed it. Does it not do that to anyone else?
@_date: 2013-05-30 22:13:35
I just installed electrum by creating a new wallet, entering in my code, and setting up an SSL server but now under Receive and Main Account it is displaying 5 different bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:11:26
So how can I get rid of an address because when I reinstalled electrum it gave me another address, so now I have 6. Also, what happens if you totally abandon all of your address and seed(or private key, I'm not sure which one)? Is it unsafe? Can I just create a brand new set of addresses with a new seed?
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:43:45
What do you mean who would I owe them to?
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:10:22
So these other wallets use their remote server? So which is safer then?
