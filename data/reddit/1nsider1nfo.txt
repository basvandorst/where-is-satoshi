thank you

Yeah, guess it doesn't apply to everyone. Even people who know perfect basic strategy like myself mess up or take bad hits/stands once in a while which pushes the edge up a bit. So 1% with no strategy chance to mess up isn't terrible.

I'm heavily invested into $MGT as well as BTC. Loaded up at $2.35 range after the massive spike and pullback. I sold a lot of MGT shares today as it will pullback slightly once again, however I'll get back into MGT or just buy more BTC.

Recent pullback = editors got to jump on the wagon. Now that they can make money, of course they are going to cover it.

You are talking to someone who works for a hedge fund lol, do you know how dumb you sound? If 500 breaks, then it goes to $220? Oh god, please stop and don't lose any more money. I feel bad for people like you that are actually trading real money.
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:26:03
Thank you I will look into this.
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:23:50
Haha, I use coinbase -- and my limits are $10k. They are out of the question.

House edge is 1% "which is low"? Lol Blackjack is around .4% to .8%

I like your ideas, but you seem a bit unstable as an individual, and honestly, I think you know that and accept that. Take care!
@_date: 2016-06-21 23:02:52
Growth is growth. It's all relative to the specific country. But I see what you're saying.
@_date: 2016-06-27 13:45:46
Yeah lol

But if the price was now $1000 you wouldn't be complaining. Read how it works before buying. The price is locked in at the time of purchase.
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:25:28
Yes per day, thank you for the suggestions!

Turn your computer off. Don't look at the price of BTC until 2 months from now. Sell for break even or profit.

Do you use them personally?

I have a express wire pending from the 3rd of April. Why hasn't Bitfinex posted an update or ETA on when these wires will be processed? Can we get an update so I know if I have to find a new business to use for trading / withdrawals?

And probably next year too

Time for a competitor to open in Montana or South Carolina where there are NO money transmitter service registration laws!  
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:49:25
That is what they said a year ago...
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:49:34
And the year before that
