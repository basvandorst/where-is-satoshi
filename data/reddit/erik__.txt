I don't think that's an IMF quote.  The article says that how Bloomberg interprets what the IMF is saying.  IMO there is no wicked plot by the IMF.
Europe has several independent countries sharing the same currency.  It's a mess.  German feels all Euro nations should practice painful austerity.  Some other countries and the IMF think some debt relief (at Germany's expense) is the best thing to do to avoid potentially dire consequences of doing things the German way.  The way the IMF sees things is that Europe is pretty much already in a crisis and they need Germany to recognize this in order to fix things.

Why did you like bitcoin in the first place?  
If you want all the regulations and protections of a highly regulated banking system, you're going to be paying for that in the form of higher fees and government intrusion. 
And those with 90%+ of their significant wealth stored in bitcoin or any single asset that can go to zero (via being lost,stolen, or otherwise) are managing their wealth like a high stakes gambler.

Mike Maloney has some good YouTube videos on the subject you can search for.  Basically the Treasury wants to spend money so they borrow it from the Fed (who prints it).  But mostly the banks wind up with some money and are allowed to lend 10x more money than they have.  The money is new debt that people borrow into existence.

Much of the big money seems to want regulation believing that it will increase the value of bitcoins.  It might, but it would also leave the door open for an altcoin with better anonymity to succeed.  The free market will decide.

If you dismiss anyone who is against bitcoin as someone who just doesn't understand it then it's an easy conclusion to reach.

It discourages legit busines people from accepting payment in bitcoin and keeping the bitcoin instead of immediately dumping for fiat.  
If bitcoin's best use is as a black market currency then they should do more to make them hard to trace (e.g. embrace zerocoin).

I think they mostly hate it because it was invented by programmers and it seems crazy to them that anyone would consider this real money.  Almost the same reason that gold bugs have for hating fiat currency.  Just substitute "invented by bankers" for "invented by programmers".

One test of a coin's robustness is how long it can survive in the wild.  Bitcoin is doing pretty well so far.

Poor countries often use USD which is continuously debased by us, or their own currencies which are debased even more by their own governments.  Poor countries have a valuable asset: cheap labor.  An honest monetary system won't leave them behind.  Money is just a substitute for barter.  When it gets debased it robs labor of its true value.

The same reason you don't see news about buying beer or coffee anymore.  People don't mind paying a few cents for small items, but when the fee is a few dollars it doesn't really make sense to buy those kinds of things with BTC.

I'm not spreading FUD.  If you've had cleared transactions recently at  20 sat/B then you've had better luck than me.  Also, you are leaving out the fact that BitPay makes you pay their network fees now as well.

You've got it about right, but the fees might not be quite that high these days.  It probably makes more sense to buy $100-$200 worth of steam wallet credits then to buy games one at a time over there.

BTC dominance dead cat bounce looks to be over.  Network effect isn't everything.  People want a fast network with low fees.  It doesn't matter if BCH or Ethereum or some other coin with better tech and smarter devs wins.  The point is BTC has lost a lot of market share this year and that trend doesn't look like it is over.

For support , it's just a price level that has held up before.  The idea being that there are a lot of buyers that look at that as a great price to buy for whatever reason.  For Resistance it's the opposite in that a lot of people look to sell at a certain price so it's tough to break through.  Resistance becomes the support when it is finally broken and support becomes the resistance when it is finally broken.

I look at investing in these coins as an investment in a network similar to owning shares in company.  The market cap is what it is.  Nxt is unproven, but isn't worthless because it isn't a straight up clone and has the potential of being a useful network.  Regular people don't normally get to invest in these things these early.  Many people would gladly invested into Facebook or Twitter years ago.  I would gladly invest into CoinBase today.  They aren't public companies.  Manage your risk by investing in all the promising coins (they are all undervalued IMO) and then you won't need to complain that your horse has new competition.
