About 1 week from Shenzhen to Vancouver or North America through UPS.

That's an interesting debate actually, my recommendation is not about the the ROI in this case.
1. Current ROI on an S5 is decent if you don't pay for your own electrical costs or if you can derive some kind of gain from the waste heat. As the rise and rise of bitcoin will show, mining now will raise XBT value later, and I didn't say buy 20 XBT worth of gear, spend like 5 on 3-4 units for a monthly gain of 300$USD/1.2XBT at a cost of 150$USD in electricity. The heat will lower your heating bill in winter so you get some savings there and your profits will go up as XBT reaches the 300$USD mark and more.
2. In my case, using credit to start up my own mining farm, the high interest rate is paid for in production and I still get 40% monthly profits after paying my hoster.
Mining is profitable, Antpool is at 50+ Peta Hash, find your way in.
This is the year of the bitcoin.

If you own your own home and have a garage or basement space, why not invest some of those into a few Antminer S5 mining units.
-The heat generated will lower your heating bill.
-The cost of electricity will pay for itself.
-The profit from the unit will help pay for more bills.
And if you can just pay the upkeep costs from your fiat lyfestle the bitcoins earned will be more than you would get from holding onto your stash of XBT.
You can also get your miners hosted like I do but the upkeep is more expensive. 
Anyone living with utilities included has no excuse not to have at least 1 miner right now.
