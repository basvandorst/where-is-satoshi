To a lot of people right now, it's just an investment

My mind applauded at this comment

You spelled literally any of the numerous options other than googling it for the love of god wrong
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:52:25
Thank you for this concise description, I think I finally understand it.

Fact: Bitcoin. Bcash. Battlestar Galactica.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:25:54
So r/Bitcoin then?
Jk guys jk...kind of...the meme posts make it feel that way sometimes
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:04:35
\*whispers\* holy shit
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:12
Between this and the "stop calling it Bcash!" interview, he's doing an amazing job of demonstrating the Streisand effect

Your Coinbase app said that Coinbase was going to have an IPO? Yeah sure, send a screenshot

I see the symbol properly on Android O

I don't like him either but you don't need to be homophobic about it
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:36:53
Yeah essentially. It was something about Roger Ver sucking cock

Bitcoin is the API to my heart

$THINK is a hidden gem, super low market cap, great team, no major exchanges yet, big announcements coming soon

"if you call them Kernels we'd be all ears"
The guy's name is Kerner, ears of corn...at least I think that's the joke

Haha thanks, that's what I get for copy and pasting the link quickly from Google search results without reading. I did download the right one, just pasted the wrong link.

To everyone coming here from r/all, joining this rollercoaster is easier than you think. But make sure you do your research first.
You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin.

MuskCoin ICO when?
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:16:39
And we got to the moon by escaping gravity ;)

This is absolutely going to be used as the header image for hundreds of Bitcoin articles once the "cool gold computer-y looking 3D rendered coin" pictures are exhausted.

Looks like a great app to send to people who want to start learning about cryptocurrencies (I'm a noob and it seems very noob-friendly from my quick perusal)
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:55:38
Definitely 10xing in 2018, I'm going all in
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:28:33
I don't understand how people think something as enormous as Google ads has employees going through every ad manually... The entire reason Google succeeded in the first place as a search engine was by automating what was once a human task (ranking search results).

They mean they now have 1BTC.
Since there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, having one of them puts you in the 21 million club.
And having 2 puts you in the 10.5 million club :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:01:29
Awesome! I'll give you some proper detailed feedback when I have a more in-depth look later tonight :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:30:35
That's awesome! I might stop by when I'm back in Toronto over Christmas :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:34:18
If we don't reach  on r/all, I'm going to be so sad
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:23:16
I took a calculated risk, but *man* am I bad at math.

any recommended reading on layers? I'm a noob, haven't seen much about lightning protocol and rootstock

Can someone do a super short ELI5 of BTC vs BCH?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:50:08
[False] ( Just look at the pictures. It's 100% a Model X.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:20:52
I'm talking about the picture in [this comment] ( not the post

This is one of those videos that will make the front page of everything in 5 years
RemindMe! 5 years "I wonder if this bot is still around or if reddit finally added a reminder feature"

Can you tell quickly how much this number is?
1.2 billion? 12 million?
It serves its purpose.
(Don't tell me that's just as easy to read as 12,627,262,748)
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:41:49
You need WAY more punctuation to make that comment clear.


@_date: 2017-10-15 07:21:08
I don't know why but I find it kind of adorable that you thought they were motivational posters
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:49:37
Haha no worries, felt really stupid for a second when I saw your comment but then I realized it wasn't clear that I wasn't talking about the picture in the post
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:56:47
I'm new to bitcoin (just bought about $100 worth to start learning about it, but will probably buy more soon), but I assume you're talking about the original whitepaper introducing it?
Does it talk about the future the creators envision for it?
Sorry for the noob question.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:05:29
Ohhhh haha that makes sense
