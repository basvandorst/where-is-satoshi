I’m not lobbying against it at all. I’m just pointing out the fact that you can’t force anyone to do anything. Maybe Segwit was just a bad idea in the first place? What’s gonna happen if two years from now segwit adoption is still low an LN is nowhere to be seen? You just gonna roll over and not try anything else?

If you want to get in for the first time but are nervous, then just take whatever amount of money you want to spend and divide it into two or three buys that are a few days to a week apart. That way if it moves down, you can lower your average buy in, and if it moves up, your average will still be below whatever the current price is and you won't feel like you bought at a top. Really helps take the edge off jumping in for the first time. After that, you can just add to your position every week or month or whatever.

It's a huge untapped market, for one. You think the bitcoin the price is high now? it'd be much higher if it was actually usable for micro transactions. For another thing, it would actually help those people and make the world a better place. Micro transactions and helping the global unbanked were one of the key selling points for bitcoin years ago, before the current dev team took over and decided to turn it into into digital gold.

Try to think this out for a second. If people could actually use it as a payment system, the price would be higher than it is now. The price of an inelastic good going up doesn't mean anything other than more money is coming in. Success and failure depends on what your goals are. If your goal is for the price to go up, then yes, it's successful, but still not as successful as it could be. If your goal is for it to be a payment system, then it's failing. 
FYI, I definitely have more btc than you, so I'm not mad if it goes up. Pointing to the price doesn't prove your point, it just makes you look like an idiot with no real argument.

That doesn't address my point though. If there's a solution that fixes the problem immediately and doesn't require anything of anyone, why not implement it? Ok, so segwit and LN will take time. Great, what are we going to do before then to keep from hemorrhaging users?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:52:28
Artificial or not, the delays are very real and having an impact on the price and adoption. You can't force people to do things your way, so the best solutions are the ones that have an actual impact.

People *are* using other coins and payment methods. That's kind of the whole point of this thread and the problem people are trying to discuss. If everybody switches to a different coin or payment system then bitcoin has failed.

I appreciate that you haven't devolved into mockery and insults, but you're still just dodging the question. Increasing the block size would be have an immediate impact, require minimal effort from all parties, and be effective. So why not use all the tools at our disposal while coming up with longer term solutions instead of intentionally hamstringing bitcoin and ceding ground to other coins?

That's exactly it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:13:38
If your solution doesn't actually fix the problem, then it's not a solution. Why offload work onto other people with segwit when an actual block size increase would solve the problem immediately and not require anyone else to do anything other than download the new software?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:34:26
You're just being obtuse now. Whatever, I guess we'll just have to watch bitcoin slowly die because "we can't just have a hard fork for only 2x." 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:16:25
The amount of work is hardly the same. For a hard fork the only thing anyone has to do is update and run new software. To implement segwit requires an actual developer to work on your behalf. A block size increase is literally just changing a 1 to a 2. 
Edit: correction, for a hard fork the only people that have to even update their software would be miners. Everyone else does nothing.

I personally have no problem with people that bring up those issues, but the overwhelming majority of buttcoiners don't actually talk about those things. Not to mention that those are minor issues with already pending solutions, so to act as if they spell the end of bitcoin is dishonest at worst and totally ignorant at best, which is reason enough to downvote them when they come up. 
I don't pretend to represent all of r/bitcoin and I agree that there are a lot of people here that sound like lunatics, but I haven't really come across any truly well reasoned arguments for why bitcoin will fail yet, and I've been here for years.

I've already read some of his work but I don't really care about the communist manifesto, so I'll pass. That said, if socialism is supposed to be a transitionary phase between capitalism and communism then that still means they're two distinctly different things, and that equating them is wrong. So thanks for backing me up. 
Additionally, Socialist parties are pretty popular all across Europe, and the people that self identify as Socialists (myself included) don't really think in those terms. Changing the economic system isn't a tenet of modern socialism, but it is something that communist parties advocate. You can keep trying to paint them as the same, but then you're really just arguing against a straw man.

First off, the target inflation rate is 2%. Nobody is trying to actually tank the value of any currency and to say that they are is a flat out lie. 
Second off, it's our monetary policy that actually allowed the us economy to recover in the last few years. Whereas balanced budget requirements and austerity have resulted in Europe being on the brink of a triple dip recession currently. Your argument only makes sense if you ignore reality. 
Third, taxes won't be the only source of demand for dollars and other currencies, it's just the most obvious one. Goods and services priced in local currencies will be another. While I agree that bitcoin will become more stable over time, it's unlikely to ever become as stable in value as the dollar or other major currencies. All it takes is a percentage point or two of extra volatility to prevent producers and service providers from pricing things in bitcoin. If the value is increasing then that means goods priced in btc would get more expensive over time, and if the value is decreasing it means they get cheaper, neither is very good for a producer or service provider.

It's pretty patronizing and condescending of you to try and "give me a lesson," but I'll look past that since at least you took the time to give a somewhat proper response. 
The problem with your thinking is that it's outdated. At this point in history most capital and wealth is already concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and funds, and the savings rate has little to no impact on new investments and start ups. Take the tech industry for example, do new companies go to banks to fund themselves or do they look for venture capitalists? 
On top of that you give too much weight to "malinvestments" and their impact on the greater economy/public. Yes, it is possible that too many of these start ups might go bust at once, but since the funding is coming from private individuals and funds that already own a disproportionate amount of wealth the effects on the greater public are limited. 
Not to mention that the value added to the economy by these companies doesn't all just disappear the moment they go bankrupt. A lot of real estate developers and finance companies dealing with mortgage backed securities went busy in 2008, yes, but the housing they built still exists and that has value.
If you really want to see the impact of each respective policy all you have to do is compare the US to Europe since 2008. 
That said, we weren't really discussing economic policy, we were discussing why bitcoin will never fully replace the US dollar or fiat currencies in general, and you've failed to address my major points. I'll cede this whole economic policy discussion to you if you'd be willing to respond to the other points I've made. I see the level of control over the economy that central banks provide governments as a good thing and added utility, but if you don't see things that way then we can agree to disagree on that point. 
My other points:
1) Taxes will always be a reality and will always be denominated in local currency, and will therefore provide some level of demand for fiat. Taxes are already self reported and the fact that more people can fully secure their savings doesn't mean that everyone is suddenly going to want to stop paying taxes. And besides, just because the govt can't get at your bitcoins doesn't mean they can't get at your house, car, wages, or any other assets you have. Bitcoins wouldn't be very useful inside a prison cell either. Tax compliance will remain very high regardless of how widespread bitcoin is. 
2) I agree that the price of bitcoin will get more stable over time, but for as long as the dollar or any other currency is more predictable we will see prices of goods pegged to and sales settled in local currencies. 1-2% inflation per year may slowly eat away at your savings, but at least firms know what to expect and can build successful business models on top of that. Price swings up and down, even if only a few percentage points, would wipe out and bankrupt a lot firms that operate on tight margins, and that means that for as long as bitcoin is more volatile than the dollar, it will not replace the dollar for most goods and services. 
I still expect the value to rise dramatically over time and for bitcoin to have all kinds of positive impacts, but to think it will replace all fiat is just wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:01:33
That thought experiment is poorly thought out. Store of value isn't the only source of utility for a currency. As long as governments require taxes to be paid in their respective fiat currencies there will always be demand for them. On top of that, being able to control the monetary supply is a form of utility in and of itself. One that we currently use to avoid huge deflationary spirals and to encourage investment so as to grow out of a recession. I'm one of those people that think bitcoin will coexist with fiat and that post did nothing to change my mind.

I understand that European states are market based, but what you and a lot of other people in this thread fail to realize is that modern European socialism does not attempt to change the economic system, but instead works within it, and Socialist parties play a major role in virtually every European government. Francois Hollande, the current French president, is a socialist. 
What an American thinks is socialism and what a European thinks is socialism are two different things. 
And yes, Americans have lots of "liberties" the Europeans don't; such as regular school shootings, huge inequality, lower social mobility, massive student loan debt, a retributive justice system that does nothing to rehabilitate, corporations that dictate politics, and a host of other things. I'm glad you feel superior but I think if you looked at things a bit more objectively you might see things differently.

We don't exactly have surveys or any studies that track that, but most people that pay attention to mining would agree. It also falls under economies of scale, which is a very well established idea. It makes sense that as the mining industry matures we would see fewer and fewer actors with more and more hashing power each, because that's what happens in every industry. 
Edit: 
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:59:13
2-3 months seems a bit delusional at the moment but there are plenty of people that expect the price to go way up in the next few years. Remember, it was trading for a dollar only 3 or 4 years ago, and today it's at ~$350. Even publicly traded stocks are capable of these kinds of increases, but they get split along the way so that the price of an individual share doesn't get too outrageous, but Apple for example has seen an over 20,000% increase in the last 30 years. 
Where you think the price is headed comes down to how useful you think bitcoin really is. I'm not a libertarian and I don't expect it to replace all currencies and take over the world, but I still think there's lots of room for growth and 10k within a few years definitely seems possible, if not likely. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:09:55
My counter argument is a consensus among historians and common sense. Just because a handful of shitty researchers put out bad research so they can sell books based on some gimmicky fringe theory doesn't mean I have to sit here and debate them.

There's all kinds of fringe theories out there, but that doesn't mean it's any bodies responsibility to address them.

Actual growth is higher than the 2% inflation target, so there is all new value being created in the process, so not quite the same. But having a steady inflation rate discourages hoarding and prevents deflationary depressions/recessions.

As somebody that doesn't really follow this whole debate, I gotta say that it's you that looks like the blind partisan here. His points were easy to understand and make sense to me. Which ones do you specifically disagree with? State your arguments. It's hard to know what's even going on half the time because these threads are nothing but people saying "stop trying to destroy bitcoin!" "No, *you're* trying to destroy bitcoin!!" Maybe try engaging in civil debate for once?
I personally don't give a shit how it's done, I just want bitcoin to be able to handle more transactions. After what seems like years of this back and forth though, my conclusion is that the community will either have to split (hard fork) and go their separate ways, or we're all just going to have to accept bitcoin as is, and it will sooner or later hit a wall in terms of adoption and stagnate. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 04:22:25
If inflation turns negative, and money starts to gain value instead of losing it, that *does* encourage people to stop participating in the economy, because why buy something for $100 dollars today when you can wait a week and get it for $90? That's what happened during the great depression, and the number one reason governments left the gold standard in the first place. Money losing value too quickly is bad, yes (that's why the inflation target is 2% and not 20%). I'm not arguing against that, but if money gains value too quickly then it's not good for the economy either. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:06:39

@_date: 2017-02-25 12:28:14
You're putting words into my mouth and purposefully exaggerating things. I never said deflation causes everyone to refuse to spend any money ever, only that it encourages hoarding to some degree, which is a fact. And when inflation is high, people go out and spend sooner than they otherwise would, which feeds into shortages as people buy up things they don't need in order to use them as stores of value. 
People do spend more Bitcoin as the price rises, but that doesn't make it a good currency, for that you need stability. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:50:10
The economy's *potential* is infinite. Technology improves a product? That adds value. Technology improves efficiency? That adds value. As technology improves, value goes up, and since technology can be forever improved, value can be forever increased. But at any given moment, the economy can certainly be measured and assigned a finite number (GDP) though.
So she's right about that, and that is the logic behind fiat currency, but the rest was nonsense.

They're building an exchange that's up to Wall Street standards, not current cryptocurrency industry standards. They want something that can handle way more volume than we've even seen in the last five years that wall st entities will be able to connect directly too, like they do with the various stock/commodity exchanges. With their money and finance industry connections, they can build something much better, and more future proof, than anything currently operating.

Your example doesn't fit. Every exchange that was around back then that's still operational today has broken through their ATH already. It's kind of weird to use an ATH for an exchange that doesn't exist anymore, no? Especially one that had restrictions on being able to withdraw. Strictly speaking, the mtgox ATH will never be broken, because mtgox doesn't exist anymore. You're not wrong that the media probably won't pay as much attention until the highest nominal dollar amount that bitcoin ever reached on any exchange is breached, but that's a different argument from saying that the ATH hasn't actually been broken. It has been broken, but the media hasn't noticed yet. 
Truth be told, I'm not sure the media will care even when we breach 1242. The massive amounts of coverage didn't really happen last time until the market was already manic, well past the previous ATH.

Yea, well being a skeptic doesn't just mean taking an antagonistic or opposing stance to something and then never changing your mind. It means questioning things until you have sufficient information to make up an informed view, and if new information presents itself you're supposed to incorporate it and adapt your thinking. 
The things you brought up aren't critical flaws, and I've yet to hear anything from a "skeptic" that isn't just some rehashed minor concern or something that is simply unfortunate but not a real problem in the grand scheme of things. 
Ease of use? Yes, it can be complicated, but there are companies stepping up to make it easier and easier. Circle is a good example of that. The internet was originally difficult to use as well, but now it's not. The same will happen with bitcoin. 
Security? Same as above. Storing them yourself can be tricky and some people get robbed, but already we have companies that are fully insured and will guarantee your deposits, which is all anyone can really ask for.
And the fact that some people aren't as tech savvy as others or that money gets stolen isn't the end of bitcoin. JPmorgan chase was just hacked and a ton of customer info was taken, which will now be used to steal money from people, but does that spell the end of banks? No. 
If nobody ever gave you a response to these issues then I'm really sorry and that does reflect poorly on the community, but if instead you don't contemplate the responses you are getting and simply repeat the same things over and over then you're not really a skeptic but are being willfully ignorant.

Would an upload time of slightly over a second actually have a noticeable impact on centralization, in Australia or anywhere else? How about the fact that any miners are most likely going to have faster than average connections anyway, how does that affect the situation? Why do you think further centralization is a bad thing? You've yet to even establish that in the first place. Is that why the devs won't include a 2mb increase? What about the transaction limit then? If you don't want to raise the limit at all then does that mean you're ok with blocks getting full and adoption stalling?

I think it has to do with people's obsession with celebrity. Sounds weird, I know, but nearly every community I've been a part of, be it gaming, forums, or w/e, has had a collection of "celebrities" that post the most, whose voices are given more authority than other peoples, and are followed around in threads by fanboys or haters. They're also always inevitably dragged into some petty internet drama that nobody besides them and their fanboys care about. This is how I see this whole thing.
The bitcoin luminaries had a few different ideas about how to do things, and enough regular posters fell in on one side of the fence or the other that it turned into an all out flame war, complete with conspiracy theories and petty bickering. So essentially, human nature?
At this point I think a hard fork is inevitable. No chance in hell you'll get any kind of consensus that requires anything more than 51% of the hashing power. 75% or 95% are pipe dreams. Eventually we'll just hit a wall, and the miners, along with the markets and maybe some big holders, will make a decision on their own and move forward without everyone else.

Crazier things have happened, and it's not impossible, but I don't believe there's any psy op campaign. I think both sides have just radicalized themselves on this topic and that there are many people who will simply refuse to go along with anything that is not 100% their plan, no matter what. I also think a hard fork is inevitable and that the network will just end up splitting and whichever one gets more miners and exchanges on board will get the honor of being the "real" bitcoin. Originally I preferred a block size increase because I thought it was easier and faster, but now I'm willing to take anything so long as it actually increases the number of transactions the network can handle, even temporarily. The way I see it, even if this segwit thing doesn't get the job done, we can always increase block size later, or visa versa. 
Since you seem so keen on me asking questions, I do have a few you might be able to help with. I haven't been following this whole ordeal, so bare with me if any of this has been addressed. 
First question: Why is 2 mb considered too big an increase by some? I'm no dev but it does seem like most households in advanced economies will have the connections and storage space to handle such an increase. 
Second question: Why did the core devs go back on their promise to miners to introduce segwit and a 2mb increase simultaneously? If you're trying to build consensus, it's a very dumb idea to go back on your word like that. And regardless of who is right, doing that is certainly going to kill off good will and make you lose credibility. 
Third question: Who decided to set consensus at 95% and do they actually think that's even possible at this point? I myself don't think any proposal will go through if that's the requirement, and it seems like they're just setting themselves up for failure. 
I can think of more if you want, but those are the big ones that come to mind.

And you do? Why does it make more sense to you that connection speeds impact centralization while economics don't? Do you know how economies of scale work? The more you make of something, the cheaper it is. The more aesics a company makes, the cheaper they are, and the more a single large buyer can scoop up. To me that seems like the reason for centralization, not connection speeds. Connection speeds far surpass bitcoin's requirements already, and the block size hasn't been touched in many years, and yet we see centralization happening anyway. If there is some research on this or something I'm missing that you're aware of, please share it with me. And if you can't engage in a civil discussion, just go away. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:30:37

Even though you didn't really hold up your end of the bargain, I'll give you a lesson on civility anyway, since you at least made an effort. 
There's going to be things you know that other people don't, and things that they know that you don't. The only way to expand your knowledge however, is to ask questions and seek answers, from a variety of sources. A civil discussion is dependent on all parties to respect each other and help each other see different points of view while sharing information.

I think weapons were sold there initially but were later banned, though I might be thinking of a different market and they may have never been allowed at all, and child porn was banned from the start. The hitmen and fake id's everyone was talking about stemmed from his actions. The FBI claimed he had people murdered but then never charged him with that. It was just a smear. 
There may have been some fraud related stuff, but it was like 95% drugs, and absolutely no CP, weapons, or hitmen.

I'm not going to read that, but since you feel so strongly about whose opinion matters more, I will leave you with this one last thought. 
The only people that really matter in this whole debate are the miners and the exchanges. Devs can be replaced in a day and code can be written in a short amount of time. Hashing power and access to liquidity however, is much harder to come by. If the markets and the miners get together and decide to circumvent core entirely, they can do that rather quickly and then it will be core who loses their voice and authority.

What would it have to be to handle 2mb block sizes? According to wikipedia, 72% of Australian households have faster than 4mb/s, with an average of 7.8 and a peak of 41.9.
Doesn't a 2mb block size mean they download a 2mb block every ten minutes? Seems fast enough to me. 
And even if it's not, is that why the devs oppose the increase? Because of Australia? Why do they matter? I'm more concerned with Europe and the US myself.

You guys do realize the vast majority of people aren't going around and following this debate as closely as you, right?

No, I don't. I made that clear ages ago. I don't particularly care about technical details either. I already told you i'm willing to accept literally any solution to this problem at this point. What I am concerned with is whether or not it's possible to even implement anything anymore, and what impacts the different solutions might have. Now that you're caught up, maybe you can answer some of my earlier questions. 
For the record, most bitcoin users are like me, and not you. If you want to convince anyone of anything, you're going to have to learn to chill out and discuss things like an adult. I'm not surprised there's been no progress on this issue, if this is how you and everyone approaches the problem.

This says average upload speed is 1.7mb/s: 
So that means it would take a little over 1 second to upload a 2mb block every ten minutes, yes? What impact would that have on the Australian bitcoin mining community? Do they have a lot of miners to begin with? Why should we care about Australia at all? Aren't most of the miners American, European, and Chinese?

The bitcoin price can keep rising without ever actually becoming a currency or supplanting fiats. That's not proof of success if that's your goal. If blocks get full, then there will be people that can't use it for economic activity, no matter what. If there is only room for x number of transactions, any number over that will be excluded from the blocks and won't go through. Do you not realize that? or do you not care and are only concerned with price? that's fine if you are, I personally am. I don't think bitcoin will ever be an actual currency, and the only reason I do hold as many as I do is because I think the value will keep rising. I have no idea what you think or want for bitcoin though, because you refuse to answer my questions.

You're the one with the comprehension problems. Bitcoin is currently in a strong uptrend. None of the sideways or slightly downward adjustments have constituted an actual downtrend. You're bragging about making money in a time frame where the price has done nothing but go up week to week. At some point though, it will run out of steam, top out, and the trend will reverse for an extended period of time, at which point all the newcomer day traders such as yourself will freak out and lose everything they made. 
Here's some genuine advice: right now you're riding an emotional high because you've never made money this easily before, and you're full of yourself because of it, but if you keep doing what you're doing, you're probably going to lose not just your profits, but most of your initial investment as well. Do yourself a favor and quit this day trading bullshit while you're ahead. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:28:36
Obsessing about past decisions and how things could have been different is not healthy. You just need to accept that things turned out the way they did and be done with it.

You're also trading an asset that has pretty much only gone up. If you can't beat holding then you're just wasting your time, and the moment things turn downwards for any extended period of time, you're going to lose more than you've made. But by all means, keep daytrading, hotshot.

Trump got way more money than that from his dad: 
"In this case, he inherited control and eventually one-quarter ownership of a family organization worth about $200 million in 1974, and invested heavily in Manhattan. Back in 1974, $200 million was worth something: close to $800 million in today’s money."

Its actually the opposite. In more conservative settings, being different (race, age, sex, orientation, etc) will automatically disqualify you from the position, regardless of how capable you may be. Imagine being a really great musician, but not being allowed to play or achieve success because you're black or a women, because that's the kind of thing that happens more often than a qualified white guy losing out on a job due to "quotas." And in a situation where two candidates are equally qualified, it's generally a better idea to go with whoever will have the more unique perspective, because having a more diverse team has been proven to improve collaboration and problem solving in various organizations.

@_date: 2019-06-01 20:06:08
I'm not sure on the timing but I do expect another 10-20x increase from previous ATH sooner or later, followed by another 80%-90% retrace, and I think a slow and steady increase in price over time is basically impossible. Once the old ATH is broken people will pour in again as the media attention and hype builds.
This certainly feels like the buildup to another bubble to me though. It was always a slow but steady rise from the bottom to the previous ATH, followed by a blowoff and rapid acceleration.

There's nothing anti keynesian about deflationary assets, they just don't believe it can fully replace the dollar, which so far has been true.

I wouldn't expect a sales boost, but it could generate some free publicity. 
The selling points as I see them are
 * It doesn't cost much to do - All you need is to sign up with Bitpay or Coinbase, put out a press release, and then teach everyone at the dealership how to use it. 
 * Potential free publicity - Bitcoin is like catnip to the media right now. Put out a press release, tweet at a few journalists (local media would be more appropriate for a dealership), hit up all the usual sites (reddit, coinmap, etc), and you have good odds of generating some news coverage. 
 * No ongoing costs - You can pay a subscription with Bitpay but they also offer a scheme where you pay per transaction, and I think Coinbase still offers the first million dollars in processed payments for free, so the dealership won't have to pay for any kind of payment service that they don't end up using.
 *   Early mover advantage - you put in a little bit of work to set everything up and situate yourselves now, and when adoption picks up the people that do look to buy a Honda in your region will be more likely to come to you. So far all the car purchases with bitcoin that I've heard of have been for more ostentatious luxury cars (some sports car, Tesla, Lambo) but if adoption picks up then I'm sure there'll be people in need of Hondas too. 
 
Yes, Bitpay can handle car sized transactions. They lock in the xbt/usd exchange rate when the sale is made and then the dealership receives the USD amount in their bank account within a day or two. 
There shouldn't be any difference in taxing. If you were holding XBT as an investment and sold it for a profit then you'd have to pay capital gains, but if you just accept it as a payment option and take USD from Bitpay then it's never even really in your possession. 
I don't think it will result in extra sales, at least not right away, but I still think it's a good idea and worth the potential publicity alone. Anything that doesn't cost much but has a large potential return is a good idea for a business, but whether or not you want to bring it up with your boss will depend on how comfortable he is with this stuff and how much he trusts you.

I bought in a lot at 60-70 and then sold some at 180, so like I said before I'm ahead over all. If it goes lower I'll buy more to bring down the average price, and if it doesn't I'll keep adding to my position too, but I won't do either until things settle down and stabilize. Aside from the the bad technicals, the news has been largely positive and I tend to think that things will pick up again rather quickly after this crash is finally over. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:43:55
Price volatility isn't that important if you're only interested in using it as a transfer/payment system because you can hedge against it by converting from your Local currency to btc to the 2nd local currency as quickly as possible, using the btc for as short a time as possible. So long as it isn't constantly and rapidly changing in price you should be fine. And if the price is constantly shifting then there's room for businesses like bitpay to take on that risk in exchange for a fee that is still lower than what a credit card transaction would cost. So in that regard, the volatility doesn't matter because it's possible to use the bitcoin network as a transfer system without ever exposing the merchant &amp; consumer to it. 
That said, I'd argue that the current volatility is largely due to the rush of people trying to buy up as many as possible before a lot of these services that will make bitcoin so important have been even developed. I think it goes without saying that we should expect volatility to decrease as the market for these coins matures and more of these services are brought online.

I don't see how accepting bitcoins from another business through Bitpay or Coinbase would be much different from accepting them from individuals. As long as they get their receipt it shouldn't really matter to them, and there's no difference between a business bitcoin wallet and a consumer bitcoin wallet.
I think the hard part will be finding an easy way for them to instantly and cheaply purchase the coins they'll need to pay you in the first place. Options will be limited depending on where they're located and where they have bank accounts. Does coinbase offer business accounts? If they do, and if your clients have American bank accounts, then they might be able to register with them and set up instant purchases, which would then allow them to purchase coins and send to you as needed. But again, I don't know if that's even a possibility.
There might be better options in their own respective countries, but then again there might not be any at all for that matter. If they have to wire transfer money to an exchange before being able to purchase coins then you'd just be making them jump through extra hoops for no reason.

Yes, winky face indeed. You're so poor the government doesn't even want any of your money and you still feel the need to hide your transactions and complain about taxes (again, you don't actually pay any). Godamnit, you're an inspiration to us *all*.

It's a service *and* a currency. It's both and people should start thinking of it in that way. It makes no sense to discuss Bitcoin's value without considering the entire network and feature set.

I agree with him. It's the loud and aggressive libertarians that breed the most disdain for bitcoin among the wider public, and it would be much easier to get regular folks on board if they didn't think that everyone involved in bitcoin is some kind of anarchist hellbent on collapsing governments around the world. Every time there's a bitcoin related thread outside of this subreddit I find myself spending a lot of time and energy dispelling the myth that we're all obsessed with supplanting the US dollar. I really wish those guys would just keep their crazy to themselves.

Go babcia go! I for one believe it. People that live through crazy things and have suffered greatly tend to be able to spot great opportunities much better than those that have lived safe and simple lives. Having seen her homeland's and family's wealth be pillaged by Nazi's is exactly the kind of life experience that would lead somebody to immediately appreciate bitcoin and the utility it offers. Also I'm a Polish American myself, so I've met many from her generation that have gone through similar things and they are overwhelmingly some of the most impressive human beings I've ever come across. You don't survive that much horror without learning how to be nimble and adaptive.

I thought it'd be the most entertaining example to use. It was that or the modern day rural (private) fire departments that watch people's houses burn if the homeowner doesn't sign up with them and pay their annual fee ahead of time. Point is, there's a reason we don't do things that way, and it's not because nobody's tried it out yet.

I'd be willing to buy something if they actually had the equipment I want. When I was shopping for a still camera the model I wanted was sold out and now that I'm looking into video cameras they don't even carry the stuff I need. Prices are only one aspect of a retail business, and I'm pretty sure theses guys will never be able to actually compete with sites like Amazon, regardless of how much cheaper they can sell things for. 
Either way, the whole point of the store was to raise awareness for bitcoin rather than to actually build a competitive business. I think it's safe to say that all major retailers are well aware of bitcoin these days and probably watching it very carefully. So as far as I'm concerned, bitcoinstore has served it's purpose successfully and is no longer needed. If these guys want to continue to help Bitcoin they should move on to new projects. There's still plenty of work to be done.

I'm very glad you see that. There seems to be a contingent of hardcore libertarians that place Bitcoin behind their personal beliefs and use it as a platform to aggressively spread their ideology. What they don't realize is that an aggressive approach like that only causes animosity among people that don't share their beliefs and paints bitcoin in a negative light among people that might otherwise find it novel and interesting.

Just wanted to voice my support for this idea. Aquaponics is something I've been interested in for years and a commercial aquaponics farm is on my short list of future ventures. It's something that can help reduce our carbon output &amp; reliance on fossil fuels while potentially providing good food and jobs to poverty stricken communities, all while using 90% less water than conventional farming methods and doesn't pollute the land whatsoever. It's honestly one of the most wholesome and undoubtedly good things I've ever encountered.

Yea, that's what I figure as well. I cashed some out around 180 and am ahead so far, but I still don't want to see that floor get taken out from under us. Although if it does I'll just buy more and bring down my average price. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:57:01
Those kind of services take a long time to develop. Bitpay or coinbase would need strong relationships with banks in various markets to offer any kind of instant currency&gt;bitcoin&gt;currency transfer options. More than likely this is the kind of thing an international bank might eventually do themselves. 
I don't think it's a flaw, but I do think a lot of libertarians are going to be upset with the way things ultimately turn out.

Please don't. The truth of the matter is that even those that do want to use bitcoins are going to want to see the euro denominated price so they can compare prices across multiple sites. Including both would be good (that's what bitcoinstore does), but getting rid of the euro price will only inconvenience customers as they will then have to go an do the conversion themselves to see if the price is worth it or not.

The value is in the larger network and not the individual coins. The coin value should ultimately be dependent on the networks total value to businesses and individuals worldwide. I don't see why that can't qualify as intrinsic value. The problem is that people feel the need to separate the coins from the network when they're really one and the same.

If you guys don't plan on holding the coin then check out Bitpay or Coinbase. They offer merchant services that allow you to exchange for USD at the point of sale. That way you'll have no volatility exposure.

This sounds so very scummy. I don't understand why he wants to pay his employees in XBT at all. It's not like his clients are going to be paying in XBT and he's just trying to avoid conversions. He's going to have to take the USD he gets paid, go buy XBT, and then pay his employees only to have them convert back. I assume some of them might be illegal, in which case they may not even have bank accounts, which leaves them with no easy way to even do the conversion in the first place. And if the pay is untaxed and under minimum wage, he's just creating the paper trail the IRS will use to shut down his business next year when they realize what's going on. 
This is a terrible idea all around. If he wants to get involved in XBT just tell him to put his own savings into it and be done with it. Forcing it on people that might not even have a way of making it useful to them is immoral and unless there's something Im missing, this isn't even in his own best interest.
Edit: Now that I think about it, this isn't even legal. Here in the US, debts must be settled in USD unless both parties agree to something else. The person in debt (your boss) cannot just force somebody to accept something else without their explicit consent, nor can he fire anybody for not accepting. I suggest you idiots speak to a lawyer before you try to move forward with this.

He's so composed and mellow in his interviews, but he comes off as pretty radical when he talks about banks and government. Most people don't agree with views like that and will only be turned off by that kind of talk. As a community, we need to tone that shit down.

It's still by far the largest and most lucrative market in the world and if you want the privilege of servicing it then you have to play by the rules. Libertarians drastically overstate the difficulty of regulatory compliance and love to warn people about how it will drive away business but the truth is that these kinds of regulations exist in just about every major market so you don't really have anywhere to go, and if you do decide to leave then your company will simply be replaced by one that doesn't have any ideological quarrels with the current system. Why? Because the profit motive is very much still there and the truth is that it takes more money and luck than skill or intelligence to run a business like this. MtGox is proof of that.

All currencies fail sooner or later. Saying the dollar will eventually end is about as insightful as saying the sun will rise tomorrow. Even before the bitcoin protocol was released China and other nations, along with their respective central banks, were subverting the dollar and slowly moving away from it. 
Bitcoin may or may not have a role in the future as an international reserve currency/commodity (probably in addition to other currencies and resources), but it will never be adopted as a national currency. Even if the dollar has to be redenominated, it will still exist in some form or another and we will always have to pay taxes in a local currency controlled by a central bank. 
The problem I have with libertarians is when they go around claiming victory over "evil statists" and giving regular people the impression that everyone involved in bitcoin wants to see the government collapse and anarchy unleashed in an attempt to actually attract new users. Not only is it delusional to ever expect bitcoin to usher in some kind of anarchist "utopia" but most people don't even see that as a positive thing, so it's actually hugely counter productive if the goal is to increase adoption. 
Like it or not, but bitcoin doesn't come with any ideology. Anybody can and will use it anyway they wish and if libertarians think that somehow everybody who touches bitcoin is going to adopt their belief system then they're in for a rude awakening.

Not all bitcoiners are libertarians. In fact, I doubt even a majority of bitcoiners are libertarians at this point. Lots of people around here are already uncomfortable with the political links in the side bar, and something even more overt would be met with a lot of disdain and pushback. Politicizing bitcoin is the easiest way to turn off a lot of people and will only add to the bitcoin hate we see in other parts of the internet/media.
I'm fine with libertarians that want to encourage btc among their own communities but you guys really need to stop trying to turn into an extension of those other forums.

Get validated with Bitpay or Coinbase and then you can have the money converted to USD when the sale is made. If you're not comfortable holding xbt you don't have to but you can still accept it as a payment option and the fees will be lower than credit cards.
