And they've also led to a generation that won't stop staring at their fucking screens every 2 minutes. What's your point? My point is that some people prefer to do shit differently to you and not everything needs to be efficient.
Warren Buffet likes his flip phone. It calls people and it can text people - The shit that a phone is supposed to do.
That's great that you love your smart phone and that lots of other people love their smart phones too, but your argument that it's inefficient is complete moot. Who cares?
Not everyone wants shit to be 110% efficient all the time and it's not "wrong" to do otherwise.
I drive a manual. Is it more efficient? Well most people would say no, but for me it makes driving more enjoyable and it keeps me focused on the road (plus saves money on repairs and makes the car more reliable too).
I use a double edge razor. Is it efficient? No, it probably takes me 10X's longer to shave. But I prefer it because it's relaxing.
I run my own web server for my websites and do all the setup through command line. I could easily afford managed web hosting or at least a CPanel license, but I like learning how to do it manually.
Who gives a shit what's efficient? If you live life and try to be efficient in every single thing you do you'll end up with your eyes glued to a screen eating McDonald's and Pizza every night.

How would you possibly live!!! 
You might even have to wait an ENTIRE HOUR until you're at a computer to check your bank account!!!
(Pro tip: I don't think Warren Buffet needs to check his bank account to make sure he can afford lunch when he's out, but that's just a guess.)
The dude is old. For some reason I don't think he really cares about checking his Facebook every 5 seconds or playing Pokemon GO.

Mate, not everyone works in technology.
Believe it or not (gasp), other jobs exist outside of programming.
My gardener doesn't need his phone on him 24/7 while he's pushing a lawn mower around. A mechanic doesn't need their phone on them 24/7 while their hands are covered in oil and grease.
When I'm out with my kids the only reason I'll look at my phone is if someone rings me or I need to check the time (any phone can do this).
I know you live and breathe nerd culture like 90% of posters on this site, but holy shit, there are people out there that don't NEED to know what some dick head on Twitter says. There are people out there that don't NEED to take an Instagram of their lunch.
There's not "doing things wrong" there's doing things differently.
Personally I can't stand the fact that people stare at their phone screens every waking second of the day and can't even put their phones down while having a meal, etc.

Seriously. 70% upvoted?
These peoples vote in elections counts the same as yours.

Wow! You zoomed in hard enough and that certainly looks like a great strategy! Thanks! Just bought 100K.

You wouldn't say with $30+ tx fees it's REALLY BADLY FREAKIN' NEEDED YESTERDAY?!
BTC is now below 40% market dominance. The media is now hyping up Ripple as the next best thing.
At this stage even a blocksize increase is probably too little, too late.

Store of value that fluctuates as much as 10% daily?

I changed to Coinjar. Coinbase just made it very simple to buy coins. Same with Coinjar. I switched to Coinjar because Coinbase lets you deposit funds, but not withdraw and there's no warning about this which is shady as fuck IMO.
Sure, there's cheaper options out there and whatever, but I don't want to pretend I'm fucking Neo hacking into a mainframe for this shit. I just want to put some money in and forget about it for a while.

I do find it fucking ridiculous that I can buy bitcoins using AUD on their website but NOWHERE does it make it obvious you can't exchange Bitcoin for real currency during the sign up phase.
I then went to cash out but apparently they don't support selling in Australia... Funnily enough, they're happy enough to take my currency in the first place...
I had to move my funds to a different service that would allow me to cash out in Australian dollars.
I think that's pretty damn shady not to make this obvious during account creation.

That's because a good percentage of this community are &lt;20 year olds that don't know anything.
A quarter of the Bitcoin community probably mined Bitcoins on their GPU their daddy bought them using electricity their parents paid for. Why anyone would take financial advice from such an immature community is beyond me.

What's wrong with Coinbase? I was able to setup an account and buy some BTC on my debit card very quickly and easy.

Most people would rather drive safely than risk crashing for fake internet points. This might be a shock to your average Redditor.

Maybe they should pay their employees more so they could actually afford to pay more taxes without starving?
CEO in 1920 made about 20X's average employee. Now it's over 250X... Hmmmm...

It was a collosally dumb move to use a payment method that could send tiny micro transactions to a website without being hit with a $20 transfer fee?
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:16:16
Uh, wouldn't throwing money at obvious jokes on April 1 be irresponsible?
These sites are no more responsible for stupid people any more than Flat Earth websites are responsible for people that actually take it seriously.

He says as he buys food with his national currency, pays his bills with fiat and fills his car with petrol he bought with fiat.

Hahahahahaha. 
Mate, you're delusional. 
Did you REALLY just compare your privileged as fuck life with someone in North Korea or someone that's survived the gulags?
Hope you're enjoying your internet access that your taxes helped to build BTW.
