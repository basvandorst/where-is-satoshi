No. The balance of the address is irrelevant. Bitcoin transactions spend outputs, not addresses.
If your address was credited 3 times with the values of 1000, 100 and 10 bits, each one of these amounts would become a different input in future transactions. You could have a transaction spending only the 10 bits input, together with other small inputs. Your previous address would still hold 1100 bits from the other two inputs.

So, I'm trying to do just that. But I'm not sure it's working, since I don't get more than 8 connections. I'm sure Tor is used as only way out, since I can see through netstat that bitcoin-qt only connects to localhost:9050. But is there a way to test whether my hidden service is reachable? I've followed everything here: 
BTW, can Tor talk with my router via UnDP? Perhaps that's the problem... (in which case the instructions I linked to could be updated to remind people of forwarding router ports).
EDIT: Just thought about one thing. Would Tor relays be sending encrypted messages to my IP:8333? That would make it blatantly obvious I'm running a bitcoin node on that IP. Or since my node would be opening itself a tor-circuit to the rendezvous node, the port on my side is random? In which case, do I even need to forward my router port? Shouldn't all connections be outgoing ones from the point of view of my router?

There's no such thing as "closed bitcoin address".
You sent your money somewhere. Think of it like a vault that needs a key to be opened. Perhaps the previous owner of the vault lost the key, that's why they told people to stop sending money there, as they cannot retrieve it anymore. But the same is true for coinbase, there's no way to make the money come back. If you sent your money to an address that nobody has the keys to, you basically threw money away and there's no way to recover it. I'm sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:30:33
Suppose you have 10 addresses which have already appeared in the chain. There's nothing in the chain, however, linking these addresses. There's no way for an outside observer to know they all belong to you.
I send 10 bits to each of these addresses, among many others.
Now, remember, bitcoin transactions spend from outputs (which become inputs), not from addresses per se. If the same address received money 3 times for example, each one of these payments would become a different input in future transactions. I'm saying this to make you understand that whatever balance these addresses hold is irrelevant to what I explain below.
Suppose you now make a payment and for whatever reason your wallet, that does not practice merge avoidance, decides to pick any of these unspent outputs of 10 bits. That will not be enough for your payment. It will likely need other outputs, potentially all of the 10 bits outputs, since not even all together they cannot pay for anything meaningful. That could then link all the 10 addresses. From now on, anybody who can link you to any of these 10 addresses can know, by the chain, that you also own the other 9.

Sure, if there's enough demand eventually it would go there. But not just because one rogue miner wanted to.

Thank you, I didn't know about this neat torify command. But it doesn't work. libtorsocks throws many WARNINGS, all of them claiming different symbols cannot be found in any shared library, and then telnet fails claiming it can't resolve the host. :(
How long could it take? I've let it running for hours and still only 8 connections.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:21:56


I hope you're right. But the thing is, due to their small amounts, they can (intentionally or not) increase the chance of such links. The link is much more likely to happen since each of these inputs cannot pay for anything, and they'll end up being all grouped in a single transaction eventually, if no coin control is used.

No. You can't go and create a 1Tb block, it won't be accepted. That's why this limit was created in Bitcoin I believe, to prevent a rogue miner from dumping a gigantic block on everyone else. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:07:17
Well we'll have to agree to disagree then. If your addresses are all publicly linked, all your transactions and balances can be known by anyone you transact with. I find it dangerous. And as you can see by some replies here, not that many people understand that. Actually it took me a while to understand why the hell would people be sending me these tiny amounts.
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:01:54
Thank you! Everything is working fine now, my node is accepting incoming connections, all via tor.
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:21:02
For ex., if an extortionist (say, the IRS, or any lower, local level gang) links you to one of the 6 addresses (by watching any identifiable transaction you make with any of them), this extortionist already know the balance you are holding in the other 5.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:54:38
You were running a full node even if you had no incoming connections. 
But yeah this means other nodes can now find you what's nice, specially because you may now serve SPV clients. Also, consider running a Tor hidden-service, even if you don't mind about hiding your IP, because that allows for nodes which are exclusively behind Tor (like mine :)) to reach you.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:54:56
Great, so port forwarding isn't what I'm missing. Any hints?
Is there a way to test my hidden service is accessible? My TorBrowser cannot connect to the .onion address, but that might be simply because bitcoin-qt doesn't know how to reply to HTTP requests...

@_date: 2015-06-16 19:23:04
I believe you're not understanding the issue at hand.
Once you link your addresses together in the blockchain (and these tiny inputs make it more likely that your wallet will do it without you noticing) anybody will be able to deduct they belong to the same person.
By extension, anyone you had transact with or will transact with in the future with any of those address, will be able to know all the others also likely belong to you. That exposes not only a larger chunk of your financial history, as potentially your entire Bitcoin balance.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:16:55
Yep. Or just donate them to some entity whose address is already public anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:20:47
He, this might be the actual reason. They could've come up with any number (9, 7, 10 which is much more "round"). The difference between 8 and 20 is not even 3 fold, I'm sure if they can handle 8 they could handle 20. They might be asking for 8 just out of superstition, even if they might not consciously admit it.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:35:45
Ah ok, now it makes sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:10:26
I'm pretty convinced that's why they've picked it. There's no meaningful difference between 8 and 20, it's not even 3 fold. If you can handle 8 you most likely can handle 20. They're asking for 8 out of superstition IMHO. But anyways, as the other commenter below said, I don't mind if it gives a bunch of Chinese reason to buy 8 BTC :-D
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:41:20
Oh bitcoin also has that. Perhaps I should not have used the word dust. It's more like "tiny", small values etc.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:00:05
Of course. I'm talking about merging outputs of different addresses.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:19:27
As soon as your wallet link the inputs in the same transaction, everyone (not only the attacker) knows all those addresses very likely belong to the same entity.
To discover which is the entity is another story. But remember that anyone you transact with, or has transact with in the past using one of those address, will be able to know it's you who own all the others.
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:11:46
You mean merge all the inputs from the same address? Yes, that would work. It would still require you using coin control techniques tough.
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:16:15
To my knowledge... all? I'm not aware of any wallet implementing merge avoidance.
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:11:26
I think there's a confusion here.
I doubt pre-2012 *addresses* where not quantum-resistant. The problem were the *coinbase addresses*, those which attribute the mining reward to the miner that finds the block. Since the miner creating the block obviously knew his pubkey, perhaps Satoshi overlooked the quantum issue and just made coinbase transactions credit a pubkey directly, instead of an address. This makes the ECDSA pubkey known. The pubkey is the not quantum resistant part, and that's the case up until today. That's why reused addresses are vulnerable to quantum attacks: their pubkeys have been revealed when they were first spent.
Pre 2012 addresses that were not part of the coinbase and never were spent from are quantum resistant AFAIK.
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:36:31
I don't think it's reasonable to assume Bitcoin would reach such prices before multiple reductions in the inflationary reward.
If hypothetically it happens, well, it would mean that Bitcoin managed to occupy an important share of the "monetary pie" of this world, meaning lots of people would be putting their wealth in cryptocurrency, instead of indirectly lending to bankrupt governments. It would represent a great good to humanity. Okay, lots of electricity would be spent, but that would be worthy it. Think about how much resources would not be available for governments to burn.

Numbers 2, 3, 5 and 9 (rephrasing 'undesirable' to 'desirable') are pretty much the strong points (advantages) of Bitcoin. These are reasons to be positive about it.
1, well, money laundering is a made-up crime anyway. If drug commerce and production was legal as it should be, and income wasn't taxed, there would be no justifications to AML laws anyways.
6 and 8 are bullshit points that have been debunked many times, just google it.
10 is also probably silly environmentalist paranoia. Energy is being spend for a good cause (for ex., all the good points you raised!), and I bet that a Bitcoin only world would save so much resources that it would compensate for the electricity spent.
The only real problems I see there are 4 and 7. There are many ways to counter 4, we're still learning. Multisig looks very promising. Number 7, well, only larger volumes could change that.

If you had really done some research as you claim, you would have already learned why easily reversible payment methods like debit cards and paypal are hardly accepted in exchange for an irreversible method like Bitcoin.
Anyways, if you really want to use these payment methods and nothing else, take a look at sites like purse.io. You may get your coins from there. You might have to pay a premium though.
My personal recommendation: don't be so afraid of meeting strangers. Buying it with cash is the most private way, thus the best IMHO. And who knows, perhaps you may even have interesting conversations with... actual people, from the outside world!

It's a blog that caters to the "internationalization crowd". I very much like the idea behind internationalization, which is the idea of distributing your existence among multiple jurisdictions, in order to decrease the power every single jurisdictions has over you. That's quite interesting and reasonable. It simply makes sense, specially when you're a libertarian like me and recognizes governments as mafia groups, and not as something good and desirable. You certainly want governments to have the less power over you as possible, and internationalization is probably the best way to achieve it.
That said, for some reason, all blogs that cater to this crowd play heavily on fear. This one particular (Sovereign Man) is constantly yelling that the apocalypse is next week. It gets quite annoying. There's the internationalman blog which is more levelheaded than Sovereign Man, but you'll still find lots of fear mongering there. That doesn't mean you won't see some very good tips and truths. You just have to filter out and not let yourself be taken by all the "imminent threats".

What intrigues me the most is how are they gathering data about DNM's addresses? How did they know you sent it to a DNM address?
The only thing I can think of is that, since it's a shared wallet, the money ended up leaving your DNM deposit address and going to another address that ether Law Enforcement or Coinbase knew were somehow related to the DNM. But to do so, either LE or Coinbase would need to be infiltrated in the DNM, making deals and so, in order to monitor a chunk of the addresses. And that's something to wonder and worry about if you're using a DNM.
@_date: 2015-08-04 09:35:58
My advice is to buy in cash, so you preserve your privacy. Take a look at sites like localbitcoins.
If you really don't care that the IRS, NSA and the likes get to know how much coins you buy, and end up going to something like Coinbase or Circle as many are suggesting, at least do your due diligence and **take your coins out of their hosted wallet after buying**. Store them in something safer like a multisig wallet, a hardware wallet, an offline wallet or paper wallet. In case these terms scare you, then just go for a multisig like Greenaddress, BitGo or CoinKite, they're simple and safer. Don't leave your coins at the exchange.
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:43:51
I hope you understand using Bitcoin via Tor is pretty damn important if you mind about privacy, because otherwise some people will try to link your transactions to your IP address. Even if they don't have the means to guess the person behind the IP, the simple link between all transactions is already some important loss of privacy. It's enough to link one single them with your identity and then done, all others get linked to.
@_date: 2015-08-28 13:56:10
There's code already written on that for altcoins. Take Monero for ex., there's a trailing average, and the absolute max limit is twice this average. But any block generated above this average receives a penalty in its inflationary reward, which is then redistributed in future blocks. This penalty grows quadratically as the size distances itself from the average. So, to make any block bigger than the average, transaction fees must be worth the penalty you'll get in inflation.
I'm not claiming this is the best model possible, but it's certainly better than constant values as in Bitcoin, IMHO. At least it can adapt to demand without hard forks, endless debates, politics, groups of interest etc etc.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:11:18
This discussion started because you contested the (quite obvious) fact that taxation is theft. Theft is when something is taken by force/threat or without the voluntary consent of the owner. Everything governments control, including the land, was taken like that. Basically, stolen. You cannot make a contract over something you've stolen (it's not yours to begin with), and that's what I explained in my previous message.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:22:44
Network effects are not to be taken lightly... they bring people, money, infrastructure, interest, reputation etc etc. On all these fronts Bitcoin beats all alts together, hands down.
But yeah, in terms of algorithms and features, there's a bunch of alts ahead of Bitcoin. Monero is the one that has been catching my attention, but it's not the only one. Plus, the alts don't (yet?) suffer from all the politic issues Bitcoin suffers. I'm starting to think these issues risk paralyzing Bitcoin development, if they haven't already. The alts can still evolve fast. Of course if any alt is to replace Bitcoin, it might get paralyzed too... but it would get there with better software already written, I'd hope.

Do you really think that with that "argument" you can debunk it so easily? Really? You honestly believe to be that smart while everyone else is super-dumb and never thought of it?
Anyways. There's an implicit debt contract between you and the restaurant. You know the restaurant is serving you food on the implicit promise that you'll pay them. And - this is the most important part - the restaurant owners are legitimate owners of their property (unless proven otherwise), and therefore have the right to make contracts concerning it. States took everything they own through threat and violence, they're not the legitimate owners of anything, so they cannot claim you owe them for using their "services". They don't even provide the service themselves, they force others to do it.
And honestly, if there is a state out there that simply charge you per service you use like an illegitimate service provider, instead of taxing you by how much you make or consume like an extortionist, please let me know!

But anyways, my previous message to which you replied was implying that reddit only did it out of pressure. That's what I was calling disgusting: the fact that simple "official pressure" could make reddit change its stance (I'm not sure it was the case but I wouldn't doubt it). A more recent example was this backpage site that suddenly had its payment channels cut. No law, no due process, nothing. Just pressure, it's all they need to subvert or even kill a business. Don't you find this disgusting?

Bitcoin is anonymous. I can create thousands of addresses without giving my name to anyone. My name is not linked to the addresses. Bitcoin is actually much more anonymous than legacy numbered bank accounts, for example.
Anonymity != traceability. The problem of Bitcoin in what concerns privacy is its full traceability.

Exit-taxes are disconnected from citizenship based taxation. You can have one without the other. Plus, I see no reason not to defer the payment of the exit-tax up until the actual moment of sale. You'd just need to register the market value of the assets at the moment the owner fiscally left the jurisdiction. This way you wouldn't force the person to sell his assets in order to immigrate.
@_date: 2015-09-18 15:40:45
Yep. And never forget the US is the only jurisdiction out there to impose and actually enforce the tyrannical concept of citizenship-based taxation. If you're a US person (having the citizenship makes you a US person), you must file your taxes to the IRS, no matter where you live and work.
The only other government to impose such rules is impoverished Eritrea, who can't really enforce it. And who's demonized by other governments and the UN for this.
The US, through FATCA, is successfully making all financial institutions in the world unpaid IRS agents. So contrary to Eritrea, they can enforce it. And most other governments don't say a thing. Actually, it is suspected that many of these foreign governments are quite happy to surrender their sovereignty on this matter, since once the infrastructure required to have FATCA is in place, other governments could switch as well to citizenship based taxation and use this already existent infrastructure in order to enforce it. Only the US government has the financial muscles to build up such global network.
Oh, and don't forget the exit-tax. When dropping the citizenship, besides this fee that's increasing considerably, you're also required to pay capital gain taxes on everything you own, as if you were selling everything. That might actually force you to sell part of your assets only to be able to pay it.

Well I guess if one is not a public person like Eduardo Saverin or others, not much would happen. I don't think you can extradite someone on tax evasion alone, specially if the person is no longer a citizen of the country asking the extradition but of the country having to concede it. Keep in mind it's not so easy to acquire a new citizenship, normally it takes years of legal residence abroad and during these years, to be a legal immigrant, you must have at least a valid passport from somewhere else... there are bills being proposed in the US that would grant the IRS the right to suspend the passport of US citizens on its own discretion (if they suspect the passport holder is owing more than 50k USD in taxes or something like that, without the need for a trial).
But taking the decision to leave and never step again on the country where you grew up is quite tough. Most immigrants have family and old friends back at their original country that they'd like to visit once in a while, even if they don't intend to ever live there again on a permanent basis.
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:32:31
Why? Why should "wealthy folks" be forced to keep paying taxes to a government of another jurisdiction, where they're no longer living in?

All the measures to hide the origins of the funds would be a little useless. As said by another poster, Satoshi's addresses are well known. What means that BTC-e in this case would know where Satoshi sent the money to. Of course, by using multiple exchanges it would become much harder to gather all the data. You'd have to subpoena/hack all of them, or they'd have to collude.
BTW I think the USD conversion is irrelevant.
Perhaps buying Monero, transferring it around many different wallets, and then converting back to BTC would be a better approach. The exchange he uses to go BTC-&gt;XMR would know its him, but once he transfer his XMR around there wouldn't be much way to track. Nobody would know with certainty where the money ended up, specially if he's patient and take some time before spending it.

* Very few jurisdictions, if any, would target consumers. In many jurisdictions already, possession of small amounts is not illegal anymore. It's the sellers that need to take care, not the buyers.
* Even if your jurisdiction is severe on this and wants to make some examples, receiving something illegal in the mail cannot be reason alone to condemn someone. It might be reason to get a warrant on you and search your place, at most. So, if you're buying with friends, a good idea would be for one person to receive the packages, but only open/store it at another person's home. This way, if the package receiver ever happens to be raided, the most they would find would be a closed package. I honestly don't believe the police would invest the resources necessary to track you down until your friend's house. Heck, I hardly believe they'd even bother with consumers at all. Their main motivation to catch "conventional" consumers is to force them to rat on the sellers, but that's not even a possibility on darknet trades.

As many others have pointed out, the hardest part is handling that amount of fiat, and converting from and to it, anonymously.
The transfer itself, once in crypto-world, can be done with a good deal of anonymity by following this guide: 
Now, the conversions from and to fiat... it's more complicated. 
But privacy is not a binary thing. There are levels. What are your aims? If it's just to avoid capital controls or taxation, then you don't need to be anonymous when entering (buying), just when exiting (selling). Actually, the only situation in which hiding the buying process would be important is if for some reason you need to keep it a strong secret how much money you have, for example if you live in a jurisdiction with wealth tax, which is not the case of either the US or Canada AFAIK. Of course, if you have large amounts, you definitely don't want all of that easily linkable to you via a simple look at the blockchain, because otherwise even illegal extortionists can steal from you, besides the government. But that can be more easily accomplished by not putting everything on a single address, not spending from "big" address directly, buying in different exchanges etc. 
Anyways, to buy and sell really anonymously, you'd need to do it in cash transfers. For these amounts, you'd need to perform many transfers. Services like purse.io allow you to indirectly buy Bitcoins by buying something else to somebody with a credit card. That is not strictly anonymous, but might be enough obfuscation for you.

Thank you.
I'll have to post again since apparently reddit has some policemen who take the ToS a bit too seriously, and my post got removed for it. See:

Geez, what the hell is your problem? I wrote that there initially and then make the link because it doesn't make sense to copy and paste. Copying and paste, distributing the conversation in multiple points, what for?
And BTW, if you don't even mind about defending your own idea against a simple doubt, why should anyone bother with your idea at all?

TorBrowser comes with HTTPSEverywhere preinstalled. Or I installed it myself and forgot it. Anyways, this addon helps considerably.

IMO it's much worse, actually. In general, evil people can do much more harm to their victims by knowing their finances in detail than by reading their e-mails (granted, quite frequently access to somebody's email is an indirect access to everything else, but still, you get my point). Financial privacy is extremely important, for safety reasons.
And BTW, I hope you don't really believe all this invasion of our privacy has anything to do with drug dealers, pedophiles and terrorists... the main reason why governments care so much about knowing about everybody's finances is taxation. The root of all this evil is the very concept of income taxes. If a government reserve the right to tax you according to how much money you make, it needs to know how much money you make to start with. If taxation was restricted to consumption or property ownership as it was the case up until the beginning of the 20th century, we would very likely still enjoy financial privacy (as people did in the past).

AFAIU if you use CoinJoin, it's noticeable in the chain you did so.
If you use these exchanges to switch to an untraceable coin and then back to BTC, there's nothing very explicit in the chain for a casual observer. A knowledgeable observer could perhaps guess you sent your coins to ShapeShift (or, if observing the other side, that you got them from xmr.to). But for that he'd need enough knowledge about the exchange's address in order to link to the one you happened to use. And most important: the most he would know is that you used an exchange. The reasons to do it may vary. Using CoinJoin can only mean you were trying to cover your tracks, what I'd say it's equivalent to using a sealed envelope in a world where everybody communicates through open post cards. People might ask "why?".

Reread my edit please. I believe Poloniex uses 0 mixin.
If you can avoid giving out information to Poloniex that's probably better. ShapeShift doesn't require any personal data and can be used behind Tor.

I always had the impression that, if you could have the two-way peg, having merged mining or not would be just a matter of option.
But don't you think without merged mining it would be too difficult to gather any hashpower, specially in the beginning, since there would be no inflation to reward the miners with?
Actually, TBH, coming from a Monero dev that position sounds contradictory. I don't know if you had voted for it or not, but Monero devs chose to have infinite, slow inflation, after an initial period of fast inflation. The only justification I can figure for this choice was the belief that without inflation there would not be enough incentives to mine. Where do you stand, concerning inflation and mining reward?
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:52:15
I don't know how this Alpha chain works. Does it mix the inputs in ring signatures? Are stealth address the default behavior? These are the two main privacy advantages of Monero, IMHO. 
Anyways, one major difference is that AFAIK Sidechain Elements are not truly p2p sidechains, in the sense that some trust in some entities is required to make the peg. That for me makes it a test only product, not something ready for production usage.

The whole point would be to share the unit of account. Different blockchains can be complementary, different currencies are inherently competitors.
A Monero chain with BTC as unit of account would be fantastic. I understand the risk you mention concerning the metadata that's given on the conversions. But I think I'm ok with that, if I'm given this pegged unit of account feature.

Came here to post this link. It's sad it didn't went to the first page while all those other stupid price-related links went.
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:00:45
Sure. TBH, any BTC-&gt; altcoin -&gt; BTC conversion series is already a good way to blur your traces. But since you mentioned Monero, I believe you expected to use its untraceability features, what would add privacy with no extra cost. But to add these features you cannot use 0 mixin.
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:44:59
Should I conclude by your last sentence that you'd like to have a peg, but not use merged mining? If that works, why not, but I think you're much more likely to have a strong chain by using merged mining, since only fees would not, specially in the beginning, bring much hashpower to your chain (if there's a peg there cannot be XMR inflation).
I know merged mining brings the risks of an attack by a Bitcoin pool, like the one Luke Jr did to an altcoin years ago. But in this case I find the likelihood small. Most pools would either ignore or join, since Monero's superior anonymity features are obvious.

Of course buying with cash is better, cash is much harder to trace than credit cards.
But if you want to cover your traces even further, I find this solution better than using Bitcoin-only mixers: 
Basically, behind Tor or VPN buy Monero anonymously with your Bitcoin in an exchange A, transfer this Monero around if you want, and then convert back into Bitcoin, again anonymously at an exchange B. Take some time in between each step. You might end up spending more, specially if price fluctuations hit you negatively (they might hit you positively though). But IMHO it's better than Bitcoin mixers, since the latter make it obvious you were trying to cover traces.

Do you know of any (safe) shared wallet that is accessible through an onion address and would allow me to mix coins without paying hefty fees?
I was going to use btc-e for that purpose but they're behind CloudFlare.
I know about Bitcoin Fog but 1-3% fee is a bit expensive for someone who's just looking for some financial privacy.

FTFY. They don't give a fuck about the others. Actually, they frequently work together.

It doesn't make sense to use a blockchain for a purely centralized token. What you say is inherently centralized. Just make a digital token like David Chaum's ecache instead, it would be much better.
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:21:02
Thank you, I didn't know about this history. 


So, if you believe fees alone cannot sustain a decent hashrate even years in the future, why do you support a sidechain that's not merged-mined?
And the most important question: AFAIK sidechans over Bitcoin would requiring a hard-fork... right? Since Monero has its current development in a much more flexible state, and hard-forks are already scheduled, do you believe it would be possible to add sidechain support to Monero instead?
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:36:50
How do you implement the return transaction? I thought a hard-fork would be needed to include a script instruction specifically for that.
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:47:27
Why Poloniex instead of ShapeShift? Poloniex requires you to provide your name etc. I don't know if they require papers since I didn't register, but if you just lie on their forms, they might be legally allowed to withhold your funds until you provide your true identity. And even after that, lying might be reason for them to just get hold of your funds forever.
Edit: And BTW, can you even specify the mixin when transferring from Poloniex? I believe they use mixin 0, so there's a clear trace between your transfer there from poloniex and XMR. You should add at least one intermediary step, transferring the money to a wallet you control, and from there making the transfer with a high mixin.
