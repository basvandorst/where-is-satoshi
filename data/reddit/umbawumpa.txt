Looks like a small dremel-bit is enough to temporary cut the PCB trace (not the whole board) that switches the opendime to "unsealed", read out the private key and "reseal" by soldering it again

luke-jr is a small-blockist (suggest it should even be smaller than 1MB), because bitcoin is not used for every-day transactions. was not and never will be.  (but thats not my worldview, thus the /s)

Tap the transaction, then tap the "Label"-symbol, edit or delete text, hit the gym and layer up
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:13:17
if you have your backup (12 words) or can make it from within the app, you can simply spend all the funds to a new account from within mycelium -&gt; cold spending
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:42:36
you can check the address without breaking it
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:49:44
woha.. i heard tx fees are on the rise, but i didnt expect it that bad... ^^^^^/s
@_date: 2016-04-15 14:02:42
I expect at least, that the opendime will show it somehow in software that it was unsealed once. But that wont help you for their intended use case of offline person-to-person passing.

If he then search-and-replace them (eg. by "0"-&gt;" and "O"-&gt;" " ), he can scan the text with a normal QR phone app.
Maybe need to play with fontsize/zoom level

You could even use mycelium for this, i heard they now support USD-locked accounts ;)

Install this wallet:   (testnet version of mycelium), go to "get Bitcoins" and trade with the "Virtual trader bot"
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:46:21
Only (afaik) mycelium allows "Offline spending", where you dont need to import the key into the wallet - it only keeps it in memory while signing the tx

Mycelium even allows to send coins from paperwallets to external addresses and send the change back to the paperwallet. (so not a sweep function)
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:07:17
yes, because it grow "organical" slow, not as OP said, "in a few days ... people will move to BTC", that would mean youtube gets invented in 1999 and everybody wants to watch the newest kitten videos. ISPs would blow up.

Use mycelium in future, it supports those addresses too.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:32:25
... and then our blocks are jammed full and nothing works and everybody will leave bitcoin as failed experiment.
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:26:57
Yeah, but its the same for bitid. What middlemen are you talking about?
With bitid a website only stores your public key and you sign in by signing a random message with it. If they get hacked, there are no credentials to be stolen.
Afaik mycelium also generates one distinct public key per website, so its even impossible to match users across different websites.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:04:21
A normal signature falls apart when the only one key available is broken (i.e. hacked, lost or whatever) - so in this regard, it would make sense
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:28:23
If you are already taking care of your masterseed, so that nobody get access to it, why not also derive your credentials from it? They wont be linked to you funds in any way.
I believe, when you know that if you loose your masterseed, then you loose your funds, you'll take much more care about if, as if it would "only" protect your identity 
@_date: 2015-12-08 13:59:57


What do you mean by that?
If i receive money to a 1address, can it be CLTV-locked? (if the sender tries to trick me, for example)

What is the main use of running a pruned node?
* to support the network, to broadcast&amp;verify transactions and as a mempool for miners
* as a personal wallet (what happends when i create a new privkey? how does the node get all relevant blocks? spv?)
* surley i cant act as a SPV provider - or?
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:13:02
You can use mycelium, they provide that Option.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:30:39
With the current price-rollercoster it makes nearly no difference, if I sell my bitcoins for plus or minus 10% market-price. But if many miners would adopt this scheme, it might stop the current downtrend, as there arent that much bitcoins for sell.
So in the medium-term future miners would profit from it, because the can sell their coins for an higher price.
Of course nobody is forcing someone to do it - its just a discount.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:53:22


The British pound makes it quite obvious: 
"I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of 10 pounds"
which is on one hand a circular reference (but has a historic root, because it meant x pound of silver)  and also shows, that cash is an IOU against the central bank who printed the money.
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:03:23
How could he write the wrong letters? There was a verification step afterwards, where he has to enter them again.
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:35:32
They (mycelium) also support multiple accounts (one account contains many addresses). With this feature you are able to have different "folders" for you monies.
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:11:52

Ah - okay. Thats really a valid point. Thx.
I just checked: its possible to add single-key accounts in addition to a HD-Accounts. So you have to make a paper-wallet and import either the public key (readonly account) or the private key. But then you have key reuse.
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:18:52
Because the initial scan after importing would take quite long, if theyd allow long gaps.
Same for addresses, but here they also 20 empty ones
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:26:31

Me too. I practically never donated or bought digital goods which were torrent-able - before i started using bitcoin....
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:53:36
The only problem is, that by tipping ~100bits new user get a very wrong picture about bitcoin. You can send it via the changetip bit to other ppl, but if you try to send it to a real wallet it fails, bec the tx fee is higher than the amount you have.
If this would have been the first experience of bitcoin for me, I'll guess I'd bailed. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:18:38
where can i find the option to pay with bitcoin from their site?

@_date: 2014-10-22 16:17:38
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:50:27
The app provides an own platform where you can announce that you want to sell bitcoin at a certain price at a certain location. You can start an encrypted chat and meet up with the person. You exchange fiat and just press one button. No scanning required. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:51:31
Then you just reuse one of the addresses - the wallet will monitor old addresses as well.

I'd gueesd that too - i was just curios if there is more behind, which I dont understand.
Maybe for very small N_HASH (which is 4 in this case) the loop gets unrolled and than it should be quite fast. But it just looks quite strange and like premature optimization.

Just to be sure, buy a little more than exactly 40USD - the exchange rate is fluctuating and there might be some withdrawal fees. Not that you are later on some cents short.
The remaining bits you can eg add to your cointip account and send some tips over reddit.

its not a Bitcoin-limit (the blockchain does not care), its a BitPay limit. I think the initial limit is 100USD, you can increase it after some AML/KYC stuff

We should centralize everything to circle. Put the blockchain in circle - get Gavin, put him into circle, he should now work for them. Circle a circle with circles and put it into circle.
Or - wasnt bitcoin all about decentralization? Its nice that there is a cool new bitcoin "bank" out there, but you know whats even more cooler? More bitcoin "banks".

Yes, thats the main point of HD - you only need to backup one key, and only once. From then on, all you new addresses are backuped

No - thats using bitcoin as proxy to spend USD. If more and more users (this will take years) earn bitcoin and accept bitcoin, there is no need for bid/ask spread and exchange fee. Then it costs 0.003 USD to maka a transaction (no matter how much you want to spend)

I cant comment on the other stuff, but i guess this is intentional - otherwise most users just will make screenshots or photos of the screen to make the backup. And this is exactly what is not intented - to have the masterseed somewhere in plaintext digitally hackable.

Same un-newsworthyness, as I received my first email in ~1994. Of course the postal system existed before email and enabled you to send messages around the world. 
But somehow it felt nice to get a email back than from the other side of the world in seconds of time.
Seeing a ~five year old, peer-created currency "just working" also gives me a nerd-hard-on. But I guess ymmv.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:39:54
Its not the point, that you can owe bitcoin, cash, gold or whateever to somebody else, and therfore create debt. Thats true - thats the same with all currencies.
But the difference is, how a unit of currency gets into existence: fiat is created as an IOU and has to be repaid in the future (mostly be borrowing new IOUs to pay back the old)
gold &amp; bitcoin: is dug out of the ground and exists from there on. the gold or bitcoins does not reflect an IOU

@_date: 2014-09-26 08:03:26
its possible but not very practical...
general workflow:
* send bitcoins to address A
* generate a transaction which sends bitcoins from A-&gt;B with an nLockTime so that it is only valid for a blockheight which is in ~20y - BUT dont broadcast it.
* Sign it with key A and store this raw transaction and the private-key B somehow (on paper)
* destroy private-key A
If the bitcoin network is still here in 20y and the transaction format hasnt changed, you can then broadcast this transaction and claim it from the address B

If you ask them per mail, you can buy their books from them per bitcoin. But it looks like that they havent embraced it completely.
@_date: 2014-12-07 15:50:32
Yes - it is possible.


No, its the other way round. If you use open source clients, you can inspect the code and every change of the code and who made it. If there is something suspicious, you should not update. 
If it is closed source or hosted on a server, you have no chance to find out, what a wallet-software is doing with your private-keys.
I read between your lines, that you fear any programmer might insert some rogue code into an open source project. Thats not how it works. In general, a project has some core developers, and if someone wants to contribute, he generates a pull-request. If the core developer think its okay, he commits the pull request and merge the code. It is not possible for everybody to just edit the code as he likes (like wikipedia). And every change is recorded via source code management tools like git.

of course the ATM will charge 10%, heck even 15%.
Until the cafe next to it will see how good this ATM is running and set up one for 9%. And also have quite a big margin. 
I guess in a high frequented area you can run an ATM on 2% margin (or even lower).
That would mean, if sender and receiver will stay in FIAT, it will cost them ~4%. As soon as one side has already Bitcoin or stays in Bitcoin, you can half the cost further.

You know that there is no "Bitcoin" entity, like a company or a group.
Bitcoin as a protocol will never be able to use biometric auth, because biometric schemes only work on a fuzzy scale. They can say with a certain percantage that the one who requests money to be sent is you. But for bitcoin to work you need a 100% reproduceable proof of identity with certain capabilities - and this is currently a public/private key set.
There might be wallets which uses biometric data to auth. you, but they always have to store the private key somewhere, so that they can access it. So, its nothing more as a fancy PIN.

Its a big difference, if new money put into circulation to make up lost units or if you scale up the divisibility.
In case 1) if you hold 1 Unit and the total amount scales up, your relative amount against the total amount is lower - your one unit just got valued less.
in case 2) your relative amount against the total amount stays always the same, no matter how many decimal places get added.

With biometric identification you can only compare a pattern against some learned patterns and get a certain probability, that it was the same human producing the patterns.
The problem here is, you must safe those learned patterns somehow in secure way and somewhere you have code which reads them and compares them. This code returns then true or false. 
It now depends, where are those pattern stored and where is this code running: on a server -&gt; you cant have zero trust. on your own client -&gt; you could change the code to always return true.

ouch. random.org now only serves the response over http**s** and tries to redirect the client to the new address. But Blockchain.info used a very naive http-implementation which ignores such responses and just hopes the returned content is the random entropy.
 If someone is eager to experiment: just feed the first 32bytes into the RNG and see what key it generates... it should be the one for 1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F

Some argue that gold will always have value, because it has some uses beside being an token of exchange. Jewelry, electronics and so on. I'm not a fan of this explanation, as I think the properties of gold are the reasons it is/was used as a token of exchange (being limited, recognizable, split- and combineable, and so on).
But now we have the same argumentative base for bitcoin. To use it as token of exchange it needs to have a value - it will always have a value, because it has some use-cases beside being a token of exchange. Namely, being an allowance to enter data into a global tamper-proof timestamped ledger.

You can just file compare the lastes force-pushed master with your local master, no need to review all the commits.
Nb.: Not that i endorse such force-pushing, but the work for reviewers is not that much.
And if only one line of code changed, you can easily publish your findings and the trezor-project would be dead.

My point is: if we somehow (which I dont think is possible) find a way to run cars without the use of fuel (or a very minimal use), it would not make the car less useful than it is now (it would even be more useful)
What if we found a possibility to build a system with the same properties like bitcoin, which does not need miners? would it be less or more useful?
Bitcoins are worth something because of their properties - not the means to how to archive these.

It is possible with plain bitcoin-core: 
But easier with: 
But always double-check your fees - with manually building tx's its very easy to make some errors and generate a big minerfee.

Read the first link for a detailed walkthough...
But with brainwallet.io you'd use the transaction tab, enter the privKey and then build the transaction in JSON format, and then click the button "sign". This should create a RAW-Transaction which could be broadcasted.
The site can also help you building the JSON, if you enter the privkey and the "To-Address", then it should query all unspent outputs of the input address and build the JSON
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:09:00

Trezor is a bit different to entropy. They provide the same security for storing your bitcoins - but at sometime youll have to spent them.
With trezor you have a dedicated piece of hardware, which is not connected to the internet and not easy to infect with viruses, which signs the tx and never gives away your privKeys.
If you have paperwallets, you somehow need to generate a signature - and if you read it in with Mycelium (even as I am a big fan of the software) it is now in memory on a device which you cant fully trust. (Connected to the internet, able to run a lot of software/spy programs/...)

* The total hashrate will get distributed over all chains - this means each chain only has a very low subset of hashing power -&gt; easy to 51%-attack
* Crossing the chains with services like shapeshift gives them a lot of power and privacy sensitive information. They are prone to get hacked, regulated or shutdown
* There is an approach for side chains, they eliminate problem 2 but are either affected by problem 1 or can be joined-mined and share the same hashrate, but that means miners need to have both chains available, which again means the same resource needs as it would be in one bigger chain

You also see under  that all branches tracked in the diagram branched away before the licences-change commit. No branching afterwards.
On top it says that there are 16 branches, but the diagram only shows less than 16. The missing branches are not shown, because the force-push changed all following commit-hashes, which are the reference-point for branches.
I see there are now two problems regarding this action:
1) backdating changes is not good at all
2) dont they know the core concepts of git? did they really think that this wont rise any suspicion? How good to they understand bitcoin then? (the blockchain has some comparable concepts to the git-chain)

As far as I understand it:
They tried to fetch additional entropy from an external entropy source:   fetches from 
    URL url = new URL("
    ...
    return IOUtils.toByteArray(connection.getInputStream());
Which is somewhat okay, if you use it as _additonal_ entropy (e.g. via a Fortuna Algorithm), **but** they used it (if available) as ultimate seed for the RNG which generates private keys.
     MyWallet.extra_seed = RandomOrgGenerator.getRandomBytes(32);
    ...
    if (extra_seed != null) {		
			random.setSeed(extra_seed);		
    }
    return new ECKey(random);
(  )
This opens up two problems: on one hand it allows the admin from random.org to influence their return (even selectively only if a android device connects) to return non-random numbers and on the other hand they have no error handling, should the random.org server return an empty response or a server error or anything that might lead to non-random content in the return.

This only circumvents the possibility that the bitcoinaddress.org-programmer included a js-backdoor which sends all privKeys back home.
So you should unplug the internet, use a new InPrivate-Tab, generate the paperwallet, print it, close the browser (thereby clearing all cookies and whatnot from this session, because of InPrivate) and then replug the internet.
This ofcourse does not help against any viruses or backdoors in the browser (plugins or whatnot)

No problem - I hope my post did not came out rude or anything. I was just surprised you changed the license and stopped updating the repo, while I was assuming im still using a OSS wallet.
I can understand you concerns regarding scammers copying it and lulling users into getting their subverted copy. But on the other hand, i think you will never be able to protect users who download the first best wallet they find somewhere without checking anything about it and then be upset that they get robbed. People with this mindset will always find someone who es eager to scam them.

What do you mean by "supply"? Exchanges dont supply the coins they sell - other people do. And this exactly dictates the price. If no one wants to sell bitcoins, buyers have to offer a higher price for paying, until sellers are happy with the price and sell. Same goes for other direction

It is enough if only a certain amount of miners (lets say 20%) decide to preferable mine on longest-chain-ending-with-a-segwit-block and a big amount of miner stay neutral and only a small amount tries to block it (~10%), then the orphan rate for the 10% gets very high. Wheres the orphan rate for the 20% and the neutrals stays the same

No, nobody withholds anything. They change their internal rules set for what's the longest chain.
Normal miner will always mine on the newest valid block they have in their chain.
SegWitPreferring miner will mine on either the newest or the second-newest if the newest does not signal SegWit, but the other does. If they are very motivated, they can repeat that rule more layers down.
This changes the orphan risk for nonSegWit miners and thus their incentives

Hi jstolfi, thank you for your detailed response. I indeed realized only after posting the link that it is not traded directly on the exchange itself. Only read a report in a german newspaper about it and there it sounded more like it will be directly traded. Read the whole report only after posting it - was too enthusiastic.
But my link did not resonate with this echochamber anyhow, so no big deal.
Only to two of your points:
ad. 4): so you really think that something that can be inflated by the whims of any company at one mouse click by 100 fold, has something thats called intrinsic value? They dont have any regulations (not that i think that would help anyway) regarding "price stability of virtual hats" or anything. Any database admin could make an "UPDATE amount=amount*100 WHERE item=&lt;id_that_i_own_myself&gt;" 
ad. 4/backing): what is the difference between a company and a group of people?
ad.5): you werent the only one giving a negative feedback to the SEC,  - so I dont know why you think that post was about you at all in the first place...

Im not your opinion on that, but with "group of people" i also included those who run services (starting from BitSquare over OpenBazar to BitPay, etc), programmers that improve Bitcoin and related protocols and clients, people that promot bitcoin, that teach about bitcoin, miners, savers/horders/holders and so on.

You seem to have a lot of incoherence in your worldview regarding btc - wonder why it fixates you that much... (at least as I understand it from these few conversations i had with you now)
only "intrinsic value" is what matters -&gt; bitcoin can not have "intrinsic value" -&gt; "All value is ultimately subjective" -&gt; "intrinsic value" has to be built up over a very long time and baked into "traditions and cultural values of a billion people" -&gt; virtual hats have intrinsic value but virtual coins not, because no company is behind it.
Have you seen the recent talk were aandreas talks about intrinsic value? The idea behind intrinsic value does not help at all - it only confuses all parties talking about it and its easier if you leave it out of the game at all.

If you mine bitcoins with GPU, the temperature does not matter at all. You will always mine sub-cent amounts per day at a loss
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:31:00
problem is, when you are on the receiving side and can not really do anything. There a lot of services that either send out big transactions with low fee and/or transactions based on many unconfirmed parents.
If any of the parents has a low fee, the whole chain takes a long time and might even get rejected down the line. So if one service uses a low fee, sends tx to other service which sends again to a user and a user to a service and then this service to you - how will you handle that and whos to blame?

If you have 64BTC, then you better taken care of them and learn a bit how to secure them and handle them. Otherwise you will sooner or later fuck up and lose them somehow. First step would be: Use a fuckin trezor and dont carry 70kUSD around with you on your smartphone

Yes, bitcoin as it is now currently can do between 300k-400k tx/day. So if all these stores would go online now on the first layer, each store could have 2 paying customers a day and the blockchain would be exhausted.
And imho it would not make a big difference if we had 10x or 100x blocksize.

@_date: 2017-04-12 11:25:21
Yes, but it would mean that all other miner (who want to stay competitive) need to adopt AsicBoost, all hardware manufactures need to include it (patents?), all programmers need to take care about it, it cripples new features that change the header structure somehow, etc... without having any upside at all (it does not save energy if all miners using it)
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:19:21
about 21.000$ - why?
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:25:28
Also id like to add: some are arguing why at all we should prevent ASICBOOST at all - if all miners do it, its plane level playing field again. Thats true, but on the other hand it absolutely has no benefit at all then - it does not reduce the "needed" energy for mining, because if all miners do it, the equilibrium will be the same as now. The only thing thats changes is, that the mining algorithm is unnecessary hard to understand and every new programmer/miner/hardware producer needs to take care about ASICBOOST (which isnt a BOOST then at all, just the "normal" mining)
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:51:56

Q: What is the appropriate fee a customer as to CPFP' to ensure to get his funds?
1) all 100 user as you showed in your calculation -&gt; they are overpaying by a factor of 100, and generating 100 new, unnecessary tx in an already overloaded mempool.
2) only one as you showed above -&gt; all other 99 are leaching
3) all 100, but distribute it fairly -&gt; again 100 tx, hard to coordinate but most fair.

The sender can not choose to use segwit or not - the receiver has  to.
If it is a normal P2PKH wallet (1... addresses) then the sender even sees that its a non segwit
if its a wallet using P2SH (3... addresses), the sender will not know if the wallet will support segwit or not. It only will be visible when the receiver later on spends the coins and reveals the script fitting to the script hash of the address.

Do we know which step is the slowest, and do I have the chain of events correct:
* Pool is mining on a certain new block [B1] full with tx (where it knows it fits on top of current chain head)
* Pool notices there might be a new chain head (via stratum "mining" on other pools or just via listing the P2P network), it only knows the header, but it does not know the new block content [B2]
* Pool chooses to abandon current block [B1] its working on, because if [B2] confirms (which is very likely) its wasting work.
* Creates new empty block [B_empty] (bec. it does not know which tx are already in [B2], and if it includes only one of them, the whole block is invalid), sitting on top of [B2] (it only needs to know the hash of it)
* distributes new work to all mining nodes
* in the meantime receives [B2]
* validates [B2]
* updates its local mempool (removing everything [B2] includes)
* builds a new block [B3] with all the remaining tx from the mempool until it hits the 1MB limit
* Abandons [B_empty] and distributes [B3] to its mining nodes
If id need to guess id say the "distributes new block to nodes" is the slowest step - or?

Switching off/on quite often introduces thermal stress in the chips/PCB. It stresses the power supply, if it goes from 100 to 0 in short time. Even more, switching on again might need some peak currents, etc. So yes, it has some negative effects

if you think that mycelium is now more insecure than before, than you are quit delusional. Sorry. 
You should always expect that they are spying on you and trying to do bad things, and then you should see how you can uncover them - as hard as possible. When you find something post it here and get the real shitstorm started.
They (mycelium) say that they dont log IPs. But they cant proof it. So they implemented a Tor hidden service - what would be the reason to do this, if they want to spy on you?
In contrast: if you compare it to a SPV-based wallet, things like chainalysis can uncover all your addresses (bloomfilter dont really help to hide them), whereas when you only connect to one server via tor, they might be able to group addresses together but not to tie them to an IP.
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:56:30
privacy is with SPV way worse than with a centralized, somewhat trustable entity. If you dont trust mycelium, us their .onion address to call their servers, then they even cant spy on you, if the want to.
In the SPV case, your practically broadcast into the world, hey these addresses belong to me. (Yeah, i know about bloomfilters, and I also know how easy it is to reconstruct your addresses from it)

@_date: 2017-07-27 11:59:26
I guess some/many/most? miners are false signalling - but you can not know this at the current point.


sounds like its given that only a few run bip91. All we know is that &gt;80% of miners signalled BIP91. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:19:21
Nope - read their manual... I also got one and its a really nice idea they had there.
This device only has to generate proof-able random numbers. If you cant trust it (either mycelium or the NSA who might have tampered the device), you can supply your own entropy via a seed. If you do so, the stick generates a additional QR code where it proofs that it included your entropy.
So, if your entropy is not entropic enough (humans are no good entropy generator), then the randomness of the device improves it. If the entropy of the device is not high enough, the result is definitely not worse than your provided salt. 
I would have no problem to hand my stick to the NSA for a week and use it afterwards to store 100BTC on a paperwallet generated with it (if i can supply my own seed)
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:21:27
so, i guess we should also include a column with [Klingon]( [Mayan]( and [Roman]( numberals. Or? Any of them is used more often than tonal and has the same right to be mentioned.
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:35:11
If you compare two random transactions, you dont gain any insight on segwit - or? You can find a lot of transaction in the current format, which send 1BTC and have very different sizes - depending on how many UTXO they spend.
Also you picked a coinbase transaction, which has no inputs at all. So, not a real good comparison, id say.
Also, just so you can rant on: With SegWit (especially the P2WPKH-in-P2SH format) the same transaction will be a few bytes bigger than the same transaction right now. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:27:29
How can this not be 100%, when BIP91 is locked in?
@_date: 2016-05-16 15:39:50
"they" (everyone will be able to run a node) never hold your funds in a way, were they would be able to spend them, or lock them for ever. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:49:11




Then the best solution is to find a trusted central entity, ask them to setup a SQL server and generate some login-tokens for all users and let them manage their accounts on the SQL server. You can get &gt;100k tx/second with quite cheap hardware nowadays. 
But thats not the value proposition bitcoin makes

Of course they don't want to fuck up the network. But if all others aren't false signalling, it does not hurt that much if I do. And it's easier than to roll out new untested software.
Tragedy of the commons and so
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:03:43


If your funds were moved without a valid signature (a missing signature is also not valid), you can prove they were stolen.
The miner who is verifying blocks needs to prove that every tx he includes is valid, by including the signatures. If we accept blocks without full valid proof, then this is not strictly a problem with segwit, but with cryptocurrency in general
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:32:42

@_date: 2017-07-07 08:41:39
Just to undestand what you are pondering about: You are comparing two different random LTC transactions, one is a legacy one and is smaller, and the the other one is a SegWit tx and is larger. Is that right?

Of course, hashfunctions are not bijective - there are infinite a and b where 
    
     H(a)=H(b) with a!=b
But: a hash function is only called cryptographical secure if there is no easy way (except brute force) to find such a and b.
If S.N. would have demonstrated that he found such a and b, sha256 has to be called dead or at least dying.

how to you spend them?

    "Bitcoin is only worth something if there are miner working on it"
    &lt;--&gt;
    "Miner only mine bitcoin, if they are worth something"
see.. we already solved this

Okay, sounds conclusive. So it might be, that in a (not too far?) future bitcoin world it might be very likely that only a very small subset of user even have a real UTXO on the blockchain (not that I think thats a bad thing, just havent seen it that way before)
So, currently its already kind of impressive to own one full bitcoin, in the future it will even be impressive to have the money to afford the fees to have a UTXO on your own

Yes, as i said. Its not different to making a hardfork right now and changeing some of the fundamental rules.
It is true that while segwit activates (and a few weeks/months?) after it, it is a bit easier to hardfork away, because not all miners are using the new rules. But after a certain time it will be as difficulty as every other rule change

Not even a dollar. you can keep a notebook running quit long for 1usd.
(About 100h, with 100W a 10c/kwh)

And you think a mobile wallet + mobile phone os + mobile phone hardware (+ the closed source wideband module which has full root access to everything) is more secure than a trezor?
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:08:57
holy shit :) made me giggle - nice comparison.

There is quite a big bounty (probably the biggest bounty ever in a software project) on finding that backdoor

This video just got posted today, maybe it helps a bit to understand LN: 
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:20:28
These guys are whitehats - they will (or already have) contact the producers and they can fix the problems or mitigate them. All-in-all such presentations make the bitcoinworld only stronger
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:06:50
Nearly unrelated fun fact: some (all?) LN implementations already support fractions of one Satoshi to be transmitted

FunFact: the first time I searched amazon for Bitcoin books, this was the **only** result:   (nsfw)

"clearly vaporware!!!" sticks fingers in ears and runs away
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:01:27
Even if you use the same address, you need to sign and pay for each input/utxo
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:10:05
Yes, thats true. But with 51% of miners behind you,  you can already do now stuff like this. Eg. "not mine transaction that end on a even number" or what ever you like. so what is the point?
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:12:18
Go [big]( or go home

That to get into bitcoin you need to initially buy coins from "them" (the bitcoin company), so "they" are getting rich by selling worthless tokens

Some of them might be false signalling

some miners will mine segwit tx and get additional mining fees. Every miner already can choose freely which valid tx he wants to include or not.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:51:01
From link:
1. Form a cartel to take over the network
2. Switch off SegWit and revert back to the current bitcoin protocol
3. Take advantage of the “AnyoneCanSpend” address to instantly steal funds associated with all SegWit transactions in blocks they mined.
This (and most of the report) is very "handwavy" and FUD'y. There is no new incentive to make a "cartel" and change something in the protocol and rob users funds. 
Why not "form a cartel, switch off signature validation, take all the funds" - it's possible right now, no need for segwit
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:04:57
Also Id like to understand: do I need to have bitcoin (i.e. an UTXO on an address i control) before i can open my first LN channel?
If a complete bitcoin-newbe wants his first coins, do he need a onchain tx first or can the exchange send him coins via LN without ever having his own "real" UTXO?

Every BIP32 and bip44 compatible will work
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:39:01
Which is correct, or what are you suggesting?
@_date: 2017-06-26 09:53:50
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:02:41
because it will make bitcoin more usable, thus more valuable and the blocks will still be well used

I used it very often and it works as expected. change goes back to paper wallet.
If you are unsure try it first with a different paper wallet with smaller amounts.
here is the relevant code:

What platform? Do you want to save 100% or spend 100%?
On android use mycelium, also check the sidebar on the right.

Im still not sure, if you dont need an UTXO even to set up a receiving channels - is there even something like a receiving channel, arent they always bidrectional? And if so, i guess you need something you can lock into the channel - or?
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:11:21
Nice, thanks a lot. Already heard about probabilistic payments, but never understood how the protocol works (still dont understand it fully, but i think i get the gist of it)
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:59:53
How does the .5 satoshi part work btw? Surely that cant be encoded in a valid bitcoin transaction that could be broadcasted to the blockchain in case of a channel shutdown - or?
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:32:25
check my history, im very pro bitcoin, but calling someone "shill" because of this statement is just plain stupid
