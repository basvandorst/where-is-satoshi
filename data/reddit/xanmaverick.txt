Yes, it is a digital display and a complication is any information presented on the watch face other than the time, but just because the Apple Watch (or any smart watch) does not have the same components as a traditional watch does not mean it is not a watch. That's like saying a Tesla isn't a car.

**1st)** I post a picture of my Apple Watch having the BTC price complication on the watch face, which is now possible because of the OS2 and app update.
**2nd)** You say that it is in fact not a complication, it is a "digital display." And yes it is a digital display.. Great observation
**3rd)** I try giving you a definition of a complication (in terms of watches). I then give a middle finger to the people who say nothing is certain by including the statement "just because the Apple Watch (or any smart watch) does not have the same components as a traditional watch does not mean it is not a watch. That's like saying a Tesla isn't a car. " This is true because a Tesla has very little similarities to a traditional car in terms of internal components.
**4th)** You try to dodge my point by saying "I didn't say it wasn't a watch I said it wasnt a complication"
**5th)** I give you the ACTUAL definition of what a complication is in terms of watches. I understand that putting that one little live price ticker does not "complicate" the physical design of the Apple Watch, but there are many things that we call by the original name given to them even if the original meaning of why the name was chosen no longer applies.
**6th)** This is my favorite part, because I swear this argument came right out of left field! Your response was "Because an apple watch is not a watch its digital, not very complicated at all and is sacrilegious to the effort required to implement actual complications into real watches."
I sincerely hope this is you tolling account or that you're ten. You stated a point that you before said was not your point, and honestly I just think it is the crux of why you are saying what you are saying. And that's fine, I do not mind if you do not like Apple, the thing that gets me is the whole "Apple Watch=Not Complicated." The [chip]( alone is much more than "not very complicated at all" and does not do any disservice to traditional watches

My fault, I misunderstood where you were coming from. But here is the definition of complication from Wikipedia, "In Horology, the study of clocks and watches, a complication refers to any feature in a timepiece beyond the simple display of hours and minutes." Can you tell me why the BTC price would not be considered a complication
