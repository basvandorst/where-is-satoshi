I'm feeling you badly bro
I was here for Mt Gox, but luckily didn't lose anything but the 90% I lost on paper.  
it turned around eventually, and wanted to double down a little by going long on 1:1 margin with 30% of my stack. All gone.  
Now a holder who has managed to accumulate fiat losses of 50%.  
I feel like the biggest failure in the world. We're lucky we have a nice army of trolls here ready to push us to breakdown or worse.  
Stay strong buddy

Not everyone is selling.  
Just the evil fuck who bankrupted me selling all of my shit on the open market :(

Give it another two weeks.
We saw a low of $170 in the 25BTC block reward era. I think this has legs to go down to $340 in the 12.5BTC block reward era.
Place some orders at $470, $450, $420, $400, $370 &amp; $350.  
After this, I'm convinced that BTC has now failed, and won't buy in until Bitcorn hits $10

I imagine that Bitfinex will not be using all the fee income they've generated in the past year to make their customers whole.  
"Fuck the customers and securing their funds. I got mine!"

To be fair, its been 25 months from the height of the bubble and people are still down over 60%.
Will that REALLY change in just 11 months...? People would be lucky to break even after 3 years.
Don't preach to others about being a "cool hand" if you've never in your bitcoin career witnessed any losses.

I WAS, but I became the laughing stock of everyone I knew. 
Hopefully we can hit $3-5k during this bubble so I can finally get mine after being humiliated for 3 years non-stop

It's over for Bitcoin. Ethereum has taken over. I can't believe what I've witnessed over the past few days - a catastrophic failure resulted in a 50% value increase. They might be back at ATH level by tomorrow.

Had you started in late November 2013, like me, you are yet to break even, even with dollar cost averaging.

Came back to just to support this message.
I personally stopped sharing my research with the community due to severe trolling and cyber-bullying
Still research in private - but will never share it on Reddit (or a medium that has a comments section) ever again. It'll be academic journals or bust. Can deal with criticism from intelligent people - but abuse and character assassination from trolls was just too much.
