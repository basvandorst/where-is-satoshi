I think the question here is (mine too), is it better to invest in Bitcoin whose price is much larger hence there's not really that much opportunity to turn a profit compared to altcoins. Correct me if wrong

I don't think a local wallet would have given him a username and password. Am I wrong?

Should we be worried the price of btc is based so much on emotion and not the value of the tech and infrastructure in place?

I used the "normal" fee in the blockchain app. It explicitly stated custom fees were for advanced users and a transaction could get stuck if a wrong custom fees were applied. I won't be doing that again however

Didn't think it was necessary. I still don't think it is.

Ok. There's no situation in which I lose the money I sent right?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:28:16
At the time of buying I could afford to lose it

My thoughts exactly
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:33:17
You betcha! :)

What? Dude I'm not trying to 'attack' BTC. I'm just looking for a way to get my transaction confirmed. I use a blockchain wallet which doesn't even support BCH
