Why would this be flagged? Airbitz is a bitcoin wallet

After Freewallet claimed we posted outdated information in our blog post yesterday and they mentioned that in fact users can change their fees when sending bitcoin. So after we asked where this option was because we couldnt find it anywhere on the app we discovered ourselves (because we never got a response from them) that their desktop website has this feature. This is very  surprising considering the majority of the users don’t use their desktop wallet, they use the app. Of course the app still does not allow any type of adjustment to the fees they charge to send bitcoin.
Even further once they told us about this feature we made an  attempt to resend the bitcoin that we used for this example yesterday. To no surprise we still couldn't send the bitcoin because their lowest option was still extremely high at 0.0002 btc or $1.80. So really this feature they added to their desktop wallet does nothing and solves nothing as the main issues are still there. As an example the Coinomi Wallet charges $0.04 - $0.08 cents to send users bitcoin and have it confirmed within the next 3 blocks. They even have one cheaper option than that. Coinomi also has real-time fee adjustments in case the bitcoin network gets congested and transaction fees temporarily rise.

My article was completed yesterday along with the attempted bitcoin transaction. There was no option to change the 0.0004 fee so if you can explain where this feature you speak of displaying 4 different fee selections I'll gladly edit my story
