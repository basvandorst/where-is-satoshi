The US doesn't have any gold left, otherwise they'd let it be audited. They're probably just passing off the gold they recently relieved the Ukrainians of :)

If you had been doing a transfer using a typical commercial bank's online, offline or ATM service, and you mistyped an account number - you probably wouldn't see your funds again - for a while at least :) Gotta love BTC.

Political double-speak, if ever I heard it. Do these people even understand what they're writing?!

That they have invented their own payment address scheme which doesn't work with any wallets I commonly use, which means I either have to do two transfers with some crappy/obscure intermediate wallet to make payment, or I've found it much simpler to just avoid using merchants that use them at all.

$1600? ouch. you definitely get it. have $2 on me, Hakuna_Potato! @_date: 2015-07-30 01:38:07
Still nothing there! Down the pan, I guess.

I'd just like to thank Theymos and Starmage for convincing me to switch my nodes to XT. Altcoin, my arse. Idiots. And these pricks are 'responsible' for running three of the main Bitcoin discussion forums?!
I'd also like to thank Mike Hearn for professionally handling this whole affair, and articulating well the technical reasons that we should not allow Bitcoin to stagnate at the hands of narcissists, megalomaniacs and stroppy little children.

Discussion of most interesting topics has been banned since censorship and corruption became rife here, so people are looking for and posting the interesting stuff elsewhere. Basicllly, when that happened, the more interesting portion of the community updated their bookmarks :)

Be an honourable moderator then and hand over the reins to someone competent and unbiased. Let it go. Grow up and move on. Stop trying to ruin the conversations on what was once a thriving Bitcoin discussion group with your petty ideological censorship and inconsiderate banning and you might regain some respect from the wider community.

 - I work with the healthmonthly.co.uk team. We use BitPay. On payment, you will be taken to a page that displays a QR code and amount in Bitcoin to pay. With the Multibit client (which I haven't used), you would probably need to cut'n'paste the wallet address from the payment page into Multibit, and the amount and authorise/transmit the transaction. BitPay will then update the page in your browser, and direct you back to our site. BitPay will send us an independent confirmation in the background once enough confirmations have been received, and we will process your order as swiftly as is humanly possible.

personally, i'm running bitcoin-qt - haven't really had a proper look at any others yet, except darkwallet, which looks promising

Sounds tasty. Do they have real girl scouts in them?
