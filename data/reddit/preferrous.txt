By the way, regarding the claims about bex.io, I think that's highly unlikely.  Kapiton has been around since WAY before bex.io was launched… at least a full year beforehand.  Also the Kapiton API is very different from the bex.io API.

It makes sense.  It's stupid, but it makes sense.
For outbound wire transfers people will just say the money is the recipient's income.  Italy can't tax foreign nationals while outside the country.
The US is doing something very similar with FACTA, except it's a 30% withholding at the bank level instead of a 20% at the individual level.  Also FACTA applies to any transfer to an account controlled by a US person whereas the new Italian rule applies only to transfers coming into the country.

He has not even *attempted* to explain why BTC withdrawals were halted.
@_date: 2014-07-28 23:11:12
Also the SEPA withdrawal page says "Dear customers, only verified accounts can send outward wire transfer. We reserve the right to request additional information regarding the source of funds and the purpose of their transactions from our customers in order to fulfill our AML/CTF obligations."
So, two questions:
1. Has anybody ever had BTC-e demand ID documents from them?  I'm a big BTC-e supporter but there is zero chance I will send identity-theft dossiers to anybody anonymous.  I'm okay with them being anonymous so long as they return the favor.
2. If there are no reports of them demanding ID docs (yet), which appears to be the case, then what exactly does "verified account" mean?

I'm not so sure.  I *did* get one withdrawal two weeks ago that I had requested about five weeks ago, which gave me hope.  But more recently, nothing.  Now the site's offline.  I think we just got lucky with that last batch of late-December withdrawals going through.

@_date: 2014-01-19 12:39:30
Google translate sez:
Dear customers. 
I would first like to apologize for the recent problems and explain what has happened and what is happening. 
First: No customer funds is missing. Neither BTC or USD. All orders are available. The work now is to match orders and accounts; figure out which socket that is treated and which still lacks money. Everything will overcome. 
Pursuing Scandinavia's largest bitcoin-exchange virtually alone proved to be overwhelming. During the first period was the service at a hobby level that was possible to administer without problems. But as interest grew exponentially proved increasingly difficult to keep up. Drastically increased orders pace, technical difficulties and attack attempts created tremendous stress, and personal shortcomings have made it difficult for me to accept and seek help running the service. 
A major problem has been serious deficiencies in the ability to administer the service: when I wrote Kapiton I did not realize what was required in the form of ERP systems, and lack of energy meant that the development of the service stagnated just months after I launched it. 
But now I have help and we are working together to organize the mess I created. 
How to tell in any case, the situation right now: 
Swedbank Skaraborgsgatan chose with just over a month's notice, terminate any services related to the company, including both client funds account and bank giro. Their statement says that they can not guarantee that they comply with the laws regarding money laundering in and with the large number of transactions. An unfortunate decision based on poor knowledge and lack of professionalism implemented in the worst possible way. Account history is now 140 pages physical paper, which complicates management. 
Unfortunately, it is not simply to open a new customer funds account for as many users on a new bank, least of all of a company in crisis. This puts me in a situation where I was for a time unable to conduct transactions in SEK. My contact with the bank believes that it may be a month before the account is opened. 
As the bank giro ended entirely deposit information is not available right now. Bankgirocentralen expected to submit (yet) a tome of paper in the coming week. 
Meanwhile, the new accounts are set up is customer was safe. 
So what happens then when? 
I will not start taking deposits until I can guarantee that a similar situation never arises again. This means that staff issue must be resolved and that a proper ERP system must be implemented. Until these issues are resolved will only withdrawals are handled. 
I now ask for your patience and good working order to solve the problem. There have been threats, spreading rumors, stalking, harassment of loved ones and outright attempts at sabotage, which does not help you or the situation. I can only hope for your understanding for the problems that have been and emphasize my desire to set things right. Those of you who believed in me and given me support have all been invaluable, thank you very much! 
I hope that you will remain customers of Kapiton because you believe in a strong Swedish marketplace for Bitcoin, and that you are visionaries and not opportunists. 
Best regards,

If you want it to be.
You actually can send zero-fee transactions, and there are a few pools that allocate a small portion of the leftover blockspace for no-fee transactions.  Be prepared to wait a day or more for the transaction to confirm.
So "zero" is correct.  But most people will happily pay 0.0001% (which is roughly what it amounts to on something like a medical bill) to get confirmation within 10 minutes.

There are at least three people, who, upon me explaining bitcoin to them immediately asked "can it be counterfeited"?

Quite the contrary, the "reputable" exchanges lock peoples' accounts and demand identity-theft ammunition randomly.

@_date: 2014-01-11 20:57:59
Yes, there was one wave of transactions processed about three weeks ago.  Nothing since then.
I only withdrew half my balance in that wave since I was spooked by the fact that requesting a BTC withdrawal deducts the funds from your account but they don't appear on the blockchain, and the process is not reversible.  So once you put in the request, your coins are in some netherworld between the Kapiton ledger and the blockchain.
Anyways, that withdraw eventually went through, so I requested another which is probably never going to go through.  Sorta wish I'd withdrawn all of it in the first request.

That's what worries me the most.  At this point he clearly must realize that the exchange, as a business, is worthless going forward.

That's not converting, that's buying the GBTC from somebody else.  No new shares of GBTC have been created out of BTC.
I believe that, right now, due to a quirk of securities law it isn't possible to create new tradeable GBTC.  The company running GBTC can issue new shares (by buying BTC), but those shares have to be held by a single owner for a year before they are eligible for trading.

What makes you so sure?
The order book right now is around USD $16mm for BTC+USD (not counting the altcoins).  That's big money, but I think the business itself is worth a lot more than that.
Their lowest trading fee is 0.2%  At that rate it takes 347 turnovers of their order book for the fees to exceed the value of deposits.  So if the order book turns over once a day they earn more in a year than the value of the funds on the exchange.  Given that people are (understandably) wary of them and don't keep funds on the exchange unless they're being actively traded, I'd say turning over the order book every few days is pretty reasonable.
