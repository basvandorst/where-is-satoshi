You are a fucking moron.  Commodities trading the whole of your portfolio is truly gambling. Go to a fucking casino or something.
@_date: 2014-08-14 08:44:29
It's the comments in this thread that lead the educated portion of reddit to view you as uninformed, misguided, and without a clue regarding how monetary policy functions.  Fucking take a class on macro econ from the local community college with the 10 bitcoins you bought on your credit card.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:14:00
Just make sure you fart bitcoins at me bro
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:48:24
Haha as if making 120k/yr is money

“We keep Preston’s ashes at home,” she said, her voice breaking. “Sometimes I just hold them. Sometimes I get under a blanket with them and try to get warm.”
Holy Fuck.

My dream is to sit on my ass and become a multimillionaire as bitcoin goes to 10k. I don't really feel like doing all that earning stuff...
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:00:57
This group of people here at is absolutely insane.

That's a shit net worth to be dropping 40k into a program that is suffering am existential crisis currently
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:57:41
There aren't enough people with that kind of cash that are willing to drop 40k in a relatively useless commodity that has been performing terribly for a solid year. Only btc fanboys will take that risk, and if they take it with the current hash rate issues and massive sell off that is occurring id say they are making a bad move. Wait til double digits at least
@_date: 2014-09-02 03:48:09
Who the fuck would accept a salary in bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:10:40
Probably going to be bust
@_date: 2015-02-06 16:40:49
Great moment of self reflection caused by the lunacy of your peers
