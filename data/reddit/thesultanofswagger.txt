Robinhood has not enabled crypto trading yet, therefore he cannot have any evidence that they will be giving users bad prices. He implied that Robinhood was already giving bad prices, but right now Robinhood only trades US equities, for which it would be illegal for them to give bad prices.

@_date: 2018-01-05 05:00:43
Actually the price would be a lot higher than that because the quantity of BTC available to purchase is much smaller than the total outstanding BTC. Many of the holders today will hold onto a good chunk of their BTC no matter how high the price goes. If even $1 trillion of wealth flowed into BTC this year, the BTC market cap would be launched into the trillions, possibly even exceeding $10 trillion. People joke about $1mil/BTC, but it isn’t actually that far fetched.

Lol, like 10k signatures matters. They can sign up more than 10k accounts in a single day. If Coinbase continues to drag their feet the free market will do its thing. 
I personally think that Coinbase is probably built on terrible software. They can’t handle the load and they can’t adapt to changes. They probably had bad software engineers in the beginning and then they grew too fast and now they’re fucked. It’s not that they don’t want to switch to SegWit, it’s that they can’t. Don’t attribute to malice that which can be explained by incompetence.

Corporations only pay taxes on profit. Many corporations don’t pay any income taxes because they are not generating a profit. Churches don’t have profit, or shareholders for that matter. 
Also, the tax advantages that Churches have isn’t unique to religious organizations. Any non-profit can take advantage of the same rules. It doesn’t make sense to tax a non-profit because income taxes are taxes on profit.

I have access to raw exchange order books, I have confirmed that Robinhood is giving you the best price at the time of your order. In fact, because of a US law, commonly referred to in the industry as Reg NMS, it is illegal for Robinhood to buy or sell equities on your behalf at anything other than the NBBO (national best bid and offer). At the end of every trading day every broker and exchange submits all of their orders to FINRA to prove that they acted in their clients’ best interest. 
You have no idea what you are talking about so go ahead and stop trying to shit on Robinhood.

Proof of stake and sharding will do nothing to make it easier to validate the entire chain. In fact it will be the opposite, sharding will increase transaction throughput thus making the blockchain larger and more difficult to validate. 
That is the reason tamhat Core dvs want to scale on higher layers or side chains. They want it to be “easy” for normal individuals to validate the main chain so that they always have the choice of operating on a trustless chain. But for day to day transaction purposes operating on a hard to verify side chain it acceptable.

Segwit has been available for 4 short months. The exchanges, which contribute the majority of transactions, have pretty much be running around with their hair on fire trying to keep up with the explosion of growth they have to deal with. Most of them can barely keep their websites up. Given the amount of money we are dealing with any changes to how the exchanges transact has to be THOROUGHLY reviewed and tested. I am not surprised that most have not switched to segwit yet. With transaction fees getting higher and higher the exchanges will be more incentivized to upgrade. I bet most of them are using segwit within 6 months.

Bitcoin can’t be “hurt”. Bitcoin will either succeed or all cryptos will fail. Bitcoin will adapt to any challenge and shrug off every attack. Bitcoin is a small set of simple ideas with an ever evolving implementation. While Coinbase does have the power to mislead the masses into financial loss, Coinbase does not have the power to hurt or destroy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not that fragile. 
Stop worrying so much and instead spend some time really learning what bitcoin is, how it works and what it will eventually become. The future is very bright for bitcoin.

Bitcoin does not do all things YET. But there is no reason that it won’t at some point in the future. Once we have side chains where BTC can be transferred to and from the main chain in a trustless manner, bitcoin will do everything. Ideas and technology are copiable. Any good ideas or technologies that other cryptos use as their distinguishing feature can and will be replicated on a bitcoin side chain. At that point how could you justify using the alt? 
But this will take years to manifest. Until then I think certain alts will become very valuable (like Monero) because they provide a feature that bitcoin won’t for quite some time. The trick will be exiting said alts at the right time.

Bitcoin is not a company, it is pretty useless to compare it to companies. As for the telnet/ssh comparison, yes bitcoin does HAVE a protocol, but bitcoin is not a protocol. Bitcoin is an idea and a brand, and it can be backed by any technology and  any protocol. 
To survive a 100 years a crypto will need to repeatedly evolve in major ways. If Bitcoin fails at this why could any other crypto succeed long term?

Given bitcoin’s price volatility futures are not a good vehicle for funds and individual investors to get bitcoin exposure. Also, most retail investors don’t trade futures.

Many exchanges have been hacked and lots of people have lost lots of money, but getting hacked is only one concern. The other is that if the exchange has a technical issue, KYC issue, or banking issue it can result in your funds becoming inaccessible for an extended period of time. Exchanges are notoriously slow to resolve tickets, so even the smallest problem can leave you without access for months on end. 
I used to use Coinbase’s vault feature. The vault didn’t work very well and when I tried it withdraw it ran into an error. Luckily, with the vault you used to control the keys yourself, so I forced a unilateral withdrawal. Coinbase’s accounting mechanism then said my vault account had a negative 1 cent balance. At that point I couldn’t withdraw from my normal coinbase account. All of the BTC that I had in my normal account was unmoveable. I had a ticket open with Coinbase for 6 months to get that fixed. (And before you ask, yes, I did try sending a small amount to the vault to fix the issue, it didn’t work for some reason)
Another thing that can happen is the exchange had banking problems. If an exchange can’t process fiat withdrawals, then everyone with fiat on the exchange panics and pushes the price of BTC up on the exchange as they all scramble into BTC to withdraw. So if you are sitting with a bunch of fiat on an exchange and that happens you will have to decide between risking it all and keeping it as fiat until the “banking issue” is resolved, or lose a good chunk of value as you panic switch to BTC to withdraw. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:04:12
This isn’t possible. There is a federal regulation called Reg NMS that creates the concept of NBBO (national best bid &amp; offer). Buys and sells are required to be executed at the best bid or offer at the time they are submitted. Via regulation, your broker (Robinhood) has a fiduciary duty to you to execute your trade at the best possible price.
Selling order flow just means the HFT is given the first option to interact with (take the other side) of your trade. They get to see your trade before everyone else and then decide if they want to trade with you or if they want to let it go to the exchange. The HFT does not get to decide the price. They have to give you the best price available among all of the exchanges.

Both sides make this claim about sock puppets, and I think it is always over exaggerated. I think there are actually quite a few bcash supporters on reddit and that’s not that surprising. Lightning is a lot more complicated than big blocks and so a lot of people didn’t intuitively understand it when the battle was raging. Now they are dug in and afraid of finding out that they were wrong. 
I think is mostly real people that either still don’t understand lightning or are too committed to bcash monetarily/ideologically to change their view now.

It would probably be better and cheaper to script it. But the Wemo should work.
The thing to be concerned about with a relay like the Wemo is the amperage when turning it on. If a high amount of current immediately flows through the relay as it turns on then you are at risk of the relay welding itself closed. Luckily the current pull on boot of the miner is probably pretty low. 
Again, it would be better to script it. I expect the miner to have a usable API that will allow you to turn it off and on with code.

Someone who has been holding a quantity like that since 2014 isn’t going to sell right now. 14% is an amount that makes sense to move to an exchange to trade with.

It will happen (the dollar/Satoshi parity, not the unicorns thing) but it won’t be what you are thinking. A Satoshi will never be worth a 2018 dollar. It is very plausible that BTC reaches $1 million/BTC in the not so distant future (in 2018 dollars). At the current real inflation rate the dollar loses 90% of its value every ~30 years. So in 60 years it will be worth 1% of what it is worth today. That is how we reach Satoshi/dollar parity. 
Given the ridiculous amount of debt the US has, it is inevitable that the USD inflation rate will be increasing over time. So I expect Satoshi/dollar parity much sooner than 2078.

Yes wages have gone up, but with the dollar devaluing so rapidly it makes it difficult for people to save. With the dollar as a currency, if you want to save and not be robbed by inflation you have to invest. Unfortunately investing is hard and a good bit of the population, if they saved at all would probably prefer to just have USD in a savings account.

It’s all about effort, care and competence. The problem comes in because these things are very difficult to measure and ensure. We have had over 100 years to figure out aircraft and elevator security/safety and so now we are able to practically guarantee the safety of these systems given that very strict design and maintenance protocols are followed to a T. 
The same goes for software security and reliability. It is possible to build a perfect system, it just requires a lot of effort, care and expertise. And if you skimp on anything you fail.
The same thing happens in the aerospace industry. For example, if you store a plane for more than a few days without installing the pitot tube caps it can result in a deadly crash on the next flight if a bug decides to build a nest in a pitot tube (this has actually happened). Keeping elevators and airplanes safe is a matter of abiding by incredibly pedantic procedures, just like keeping a computer system secure

If you take the stance that the best technology will be the most commonly used currency and that popular currencies (like Bitcoin) can’t change or change too slowly, then you are implying that there will be a never ending train of currencies and thus none of them can be a long term store of value. 
Bitcoin is undeniably the first successful cryptocurrency. To say that a different currency will overtake Bitcoin, but then never be overtaken itself is insane. How could the flippening happen once but not more than once? 
Either Bitcoin succeeds or cryptocurrency fails. Any technical shortcomings in Bitcoin will be solved by upgrades to he Bitcoin protocol.

Dancing naked in front of a mirror? You’re a fucking moron. 
Your order ends up as public information anyways. No matter what your broker does your order comes out on the public trade feeds. The important part is that it is just an order, aka, symbol, price and size. No personally identifiable information.
Also, yes, all the big retail brokers sell order flow. ETrade, TDAmeritrade, Fidelity all sell order flow. You can look up their 606 reports. The brokers that don’t are IB and a few others like it that are oriented more towards professional traders. Although even IB does some order routing that includes HFT’s which isn’t technically “selling order flow” but it basically ends up being the same thing.

Bitcoin mining is the only usage of electricity that is completely location independent. Bitcoin mining can be setup in any location where electricity is cheap and stable (Except for very hot regions, in a hot region electricity needs to be cheap enough to make up for cooling costs). Large power plants are built looking decades into the future. They are often built with lots of excess capacity because they know that demand increases over time. Bitcoin mining can help new plants reach profitability faster by allowing them to run at near max output from day 1. I'm not saying anyone is actually doing this today, but it is inevitable given the economic benefits. 
Meanwhile, converting gold mining to non-carbon energy would be very expensive. Gold mining companies already have a lot of money invested in diesel powered equipment. Switching to electric equipment (which doesn't even exist yet) would be absurdly expensive and wasteful.

Miners will mine through a period of loss because they have significant capital investments in mining. Most miners will sell Bitcoin at a loss to maintain cash flow. This idea that miners won't sell at a loss is just not true. 
Miners do not have the luxury of choosing their sell price. Supply and demand determine the price and the supply is relatively fixed. So the only thing determining the price is the demand. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:46:57
Mining is still quite centralized. Wouldn’t take much for a government to covertly take control of the hashpower and do irrecoverable damage to people’s confidence in POW blockchains.
Do you think the miners and pools have computer security that is properly hardened to prevent nation state level attacks? They don’t. And even if some of them did the CIA can be pretty persuasive. They would only need to threaten/bribe a few low level workers into giving them a backdoor. 
The cost of a 51% attack is only the cost to hack all the major pools. A frugal state could probably get it done for $20 million.

Getting away with a big double spend would be really hard. 
Shorting BCH and then causing a big reorg could be profitable, but it might also drop the price of BTC because traders are stupid. Thus making it take longer to break even. 
I’m not saying it isn’t possible to make a profit attacking bcash, but it is not part of the business model of a miner. Given that it hasn’t been done, it is hard to tell how it would turn out. If you think you will make a good profit just mining BTC you wouldn’t risk the bcash attack. 
But that does open up an interesting point. Some of these miners who are not going to be profitable any more because of the rapid difficulty increases might look to attacking bcash as a source of profit.

BCH is listed on plenty of exchanges right now. After the 51% attack the price would drop simply because that attack happened, but also then many of the exchanges would announce that they are delisting and the price would drop hard. They can’t delist instantly. What would probably happen is that they would freeze BCH deposits pretty quickly, but trading wouldn’t stop. It would probably take them a few days to figure out how they want to handle the delisting. During this time the price would tank and you would make a ton of profit on the leveraged short position.

An ETF is not an individual account. It wouldn’t be possible to have each ETF owner decide what they want to do with forks. The ETF manager will keep or sell fork coins as they see fit. The manager has a fiduciary duty to the fund to make decisions in the best interest of the fund. 
If you want to decide what to do with forks then you need your own keys. But there are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin and have no idea what a fork even is, they would much rather buy an ETF and let someone else deal with all of the technical stuff.

Contrary to popular belief, futures does not expand the supply of bitcoin. Many people falsely assert that cash settled futures hold the price down by letting investors go long bitcoin without creating demand for bitcoin.
Every futures contract has 2 parties. For each contract someone is going short and someone is going long. If more people want to go long than short then there are more people wanting to go long than there are people to take the other side of their contracts. This issue resolves itself by the price of the futures contract departing from the price of bitcoin and creating an opportunity for arbitrage. Automated traders take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity by going short in futures and buying actual BTC to cover the short. This generates profit for the arbitragers while leaving them in a BTC neutral position. 
What this means is that if investors are going long BTC via futures, it actually results in real BTC being purchased.

The mining difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks. Realistically all the miners won’t stop all at once. First the miners with high electricity costs will start to stop.

Eventually bitcoin will only grow at the same rate as the economy. So a few percent per year. That’s not really enough to prevent people from spending and investing. Investors will expect to get a much better rate than that, especially if the fed isn’t artificially keeping interest rates so low.

Cycle 4 needs to be shorter. It’s too much greater than 4 years, which because of the halving, will end up being bitcoins natural cadence. 
Also, in cycle 4 you show the halving at the trough of the curve, but in the preceding cycles the halving is a good bit after the trough because people start pushing the price up in anticipation. This is further evidence that you drew cycle 4 too long.

The perception of Bitmain dominance comes from the fact that the other manufacturers don’t sell to small time miners.

It would depend on the transmit power of the nodes. Also, something would need to be done for the long hauls where no one lives. Like to connect the American continents or Australia to the rest of the world. Satellites are an interesting option too and the fact that they are quickly getting cheaper means there could be dedicated blockchain satellite constellations. Either way it would probably end up being a patchwork of different wireless technologies. If/when bitcoin becomes a popular currency, this infrastructure will naturally evolve because there will be people and companies that will want the security of knowing that they can process payments without the public internet. The number of companies that run private global computer networks today would shock you.

It’s is much harder to have that kind of small print for ETFs. Small time individual investors don’t have time to read that small print, but portfolio and fund managers do. An ETF that robs investors of forks won’t get far. Unlike an exchange, which is mostly neutral to the idea of everyone withdrawing all their funds to get in on the forks, an ETF is not going to want everyone selling right before a fork. A successful ETF will handle forks in a fair manner.
But the shitty ETFs that steal all the forked coins will actually benefit BTC in the long run. The ETF managers taking and selling the shitfork coins will drive the price of those forks down, helping to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance.

A double spend is not the way to profit from a 51% attack. 
Do a 10x leveraged short of BCH and then do the 51% attack + double spend. The double spend is just to get exchanges to delist BCH, causing the price to drop to near zero, making you lots of money on your leveraged short.

Except for the few months when the mempool was backed up, transacting directly on chain even for small purchases has not been a problem for me.

People will lose interest, that is guaranteed, but it doesn't matter because bitcoin isn't a hobby, it is a currency, the most sound currency ever created. As the most sound currency ever created it will reach mass adoption. As for the better tech, bitcoin will incorporate any necessary improvements. Bitcoin is not a static protocol. Bitcoin is a few simple ideas and a history of transactions (the blockchain). The technology can be changed in any way.

Online stores, like Amazon, actually already do this. Online stores have a lot of information about you. For instance all of your purchase history.

This is not possible. The problem lies in how wallets communicate “addresses” and how they build transactions.
What you want is for the sender to create a txn with 3 different outputs (4 if you count the change). But if the sender is just using a basic wallet there is no way for them to do that and no way to communicate your desire for them to do that. 
When you give the address to the spender they are going to create a transaction with 2 outputs, the first to your address, the second to their own change address.
There is no way to make it so that the single output sent to you must be split between multiple parties.
This is not a limit of bitcoin itself, just of the way that wallets have been implemented. It would be possible in the future for payment requests to specify more detailed output arrangements.

I love bitcoin, but I bet Visa has better uptime than bitcoin. Bitcoin has been down or significantly degraded many times. Also, to those of you suggesting that Visa is a single point of failure, from a technical perspective that is completely false. Visa likely has silly levels of redundancy at every layer. It is possible to have a distributed system without peer-to-peer/blockchain.
I do not count uptime, response time, or performance as Bitcoin’s strengths. Because of the constraints of being trustless, it will never be the best by those metrics. But it is best by trustlessness, immutability, inclusivity and censorship resistance, and those are the metrics that matter.

2. The display transitions and sounds (if any) that the devices make are generally terrible. Also there should be no reason to use written words. It should all be just shapes. If an actual UX designer spent 30 minutes on these they would be 100x better.
3. People are accustomed to the payment being more instantaneous. The idea that you swipe the card and your done. There is no reason the chip scanners can’t be like this. The total could be shown and you put the card in and almost instantly you get the green light to remove.

Quantum resistant public key cryptography has been created and is being researched. It will likely be possible for people to move their Bitcoin’s to quantum resistant addresses. 
Also, the only coins directly at risk of being stolen with quantum computing are coins sitting in P2PK outputs, which was used in the early days but then the default switched to P2PKH. Most of the lost P2PKH outputs should be safe from quantum computing forever because SHA256 is not vulnerable to quantum hacking.

It probably works in a very similar way to normal lightning transactions. Routing lightning payments involves hashed time locked contracts, they just don’t get published to the chain under normal circumstances. Each node in the route sets up HTLC’s with the nodes before and after them in the chain. The point of an HTLC is that if a hash preimage is revealed within the time lock time, then the transaction is successful. The receiving node is the only node to know the preimage initially. After all the HTLCs are setup the receiving node reveals the preimage to the previous node. Then that node reveals the preimage to the next one and so on. 
Thus, I would guess that for submarine swaps, they are basically just another HTLC in the chain. The transaction is published, but the next person in the chain can only receive the funds if the preimage is revealed. If the preimage isn’t revealed within the allotted time then the original owner can reclaim the funds. 
So it works exactly like a lightning payment in terms of the type of Bitcoin script used, it’s just that the submarine part is always published to the blockchain instead of just existing in state channels.
Or I could be wrong and they actually found an even more clever and efficient way of doing it, but the method I described would work and would be completely trustless.

 \&gt; Today 0.7% of people are millionaires, but in the future that's likely to shrink, as we know the wealth gap is growing. 
The wealth gap is growing, not because people are getting poorer, but because people keep reaching new levels of wealth. There are more millionaires and billionaires than ever before and not just because of inflation. Wealth growth on the high end is just faster than wealth growth for the 90%. 
Another common misconception is caused by pairing the fact that the wealth gap is increasing with the idea that of "the rich getting richer". Yea, the top 1% is getting more wealthy, but the top 1% is not a fixed set of people. Take the worlds richest person, Jeff Bezos. He wasn't in the top 1% until he started and it took off. That is the real reason that the wealth gap is growing, because technology has made it easier than ever to build businesses that generate huge amounts of wealth.

This is wrong. Futures can be used to short or long. In fact each futures contract represents an equal amount of short and long. So just an increase in volume can’t tell you anything. 
To get any sort of idea of what the futures traders are thinking you have to look at the change in the futures premium over the period of increased volume. This can indicate whether the volume has been driven by people shorting or people going long.
Edit: looks like the futures are trading at a slight premium to BTC.  This could mean that the futures traders are bullish on BTC.

What you have described here is saving, which is actually very powerful. Saving enables investment. Over time hodlers will slowly decide to diversify their investments like buying homes and starting businesses. The value of bitcoin is that it is both portable and can hold value. Bitcoin allows you store your value until you find something to spend your wealth on or you find what you consider to be a better investment. There will always be people looking to store value, and thus there will always be people interested in buying bitcoin. You don’t have to worry about everyone “cashing out” at the same time.

Except that owning all the Bitcoin doesn’t allow you to keep the price from going up. All it takes is someone with $60 billion to come along and dump it into Bitcoin. In order to keep Bitcoin at the current price during that the manipulator would have to sell their entire stack at the current price, leaving them with nothing.


Yup, but again, there literally isn’t enough Bitcoin in the world to do this. Even if this manipulator owned 100% of the Bitcoin’s they wouldn’t be able to stop someone with $60 billion from pushing the price up.


You spent $1M on spot but your futures trade just generated 300% or $1M due to leverage.
This would be essentially robbing the person on the short side of the futures trade. Futures traders are generally pretty sophisticated, they are unliked to allow themselves to be repeatedly gamed in that fashion. Using the proposed scheme every dollar that the manipulator makes comes straight from the person on the other side of the futures trade. It’s just unrealistic to think that futures traders would fall for this repeatedly.

I did a bit more research on this. Prior to 2005 a “seat” not only allowed you to be on the floor, but was also equity in the exchange itself. Seats were traded assets. After 2005 they switched to selling trading licenses and issued stock for the equity. Having a trading license, aka being a member of the exchange, allows you to trade on the exchange. For the most part members are brokers, banks and high frequency trading companies. So your broker (E*TRADE, Fidelity, etc) is a member so that they can make orders on the exchange on your behalf.

I know in your head you think a whale can sell a bunch to get the price to go down and then buy it all back at the bottom, but that’s not how it works. 
There are 2 MAJOR issues with that strategy:
1. Buying back in would cause the price to rise just as much as selling caused it to drop. Best case scenario you can hope to break even. Small traders can make the highest gains in a volatile market because their smaller orders have a lot less slippage. 
2. Unless all the institutions and whales are colluding (spoiler, they aren’t) then one market manipulator has no guarantee that another whale won’t eat their lunch. Someone who is considering using their massive amount of funds to drop the price of Bitcoin has no idea if there are other whales on the sidelines waiting to snap up cheaper coins. And they have no idea how many coins those buyers want and what their target acquisition price is. 
There is no great conspiracy. There are definitely smaller conspiracies, like insider trading at Coinbase and such, but nothing on the scale you are insinuating.

I think there are quite a few bitcoiners among us that get a little scared and defensive when a good alt comes along. They perceive it as a threat to bitcoin. What they fail to realize is that while previous blocks are immutable, Bitcoin the protocol is evolving. Bitcoin will incorporate all the best technology in the safest ways possible. It has to. It is the only way this crazy experiment will work.  Bitcoin will be the best blockchain with respect to the functionality/stability ratio. It may take time to incorporate features, but that is fine. Doing it right is the most important thing and there is nothing wrong with letting alts prove out new concepts. 10 years from now bitcoin will be totally different than it is today. We will maintain the core principals of decentralization, trustlessness and 21 million, but the rest of the tech could be completely different. This is what will make bitcoin last the test of time. Only through evolution will it succeed and the best method will often be incorporating technology proven out by other blockchains. Bitcoin already has first mover advantage, it doesn’t need to be the first chain to implement every feature. And for that reason we need to welcome alts and help them flourish, because alts are the feeder for the big league.

Is routing on the Lightning network hard? Yes. Impossible? Definitely not. We probably won’t get a perfect solution this year, but I bet we have a workable one that meets the scaling demands that we actually have right now. It might take a few years before someone figures out a highly efficient routing method that allows infinite scaling, but who cares? We won’t need infinite scaling for another decade anyways. 
Another cool thing is that upgrading LN routing algorithms won’t require hardforks and many competing solutions can exist at the same time.

First of all, inflation does not benefit borrowers because it is compensated for in the interest rate. In fact, inflation uncertainty is a risk paid for by the borrower. 
Let’s say the fair market interest rate for a loan in a perfectly stable currency is 8%. Long term the deflation rate for Bitcoin will be equal to the annual increase in global wealth, so let’s ball park it at 5%. That creates an effective interest rate of ~13%. High by today’s standards with the fed going crazy, but a normal rate for a mortgage in the 90’s. 
But also consider that the world doesn’t need to run on debt. In fact it is possible that we would be better off if interest rates disincentivized debt. People can buy smaller/cheaper houses. And business generally isn’t funded by fractional reserve debt. Business is funded by investment.

Auto-closing based on fees seems really dangerous. Seems like a good way to end up with exponential congestion. Let’s say fees are relatively steady for a while and many channels are opened. Then for some reason there is a burst in demand for block space (bull run, or crash or something) or there is a sudden decrease in supply (contentious fork, or a bunch of miners go offline for some reason). The fees would spike up triggering most of the open lightning channels to close. If there are hundreds of thousands or millions of channels open this would cause a serious mempool backlog.  Not only that, but then people would have to open new channels to continue to use the currency.

That’s the thing though. The block space is finite, no amount of higher fees will increase the block space. It will create a situation ripe for trying to close channels with incorrect states.
Luckily, it doesn’t matter because the person who first mentioned fee based auto-closing channels retracted his statement. I find it hard to believe all the smart people working on LN wouldn’t have considered the dangers of fee based auto-closing.

Back in the day people put their gold in banks mostly for 2 reasons:
1. Banks provided security. This is not nearly as relevant for Bitcoin because it’s not so hard to secure Bitcoin by oneself. 
2. Notes are more easily transported and divided than gold, making notes much easier to use. Later on electronic banking was invented which is even better than notes. But Bitcoin is already highly divisible and easily transported and transferred. A bank can’t really do much to make Bitcoin more usable.

Hardware wallets will become easier to use. Crypto wallets in general have the potential to be just as easy and convenient as any centralized solution. And yet, yes, some people will still put their Bitcoins in a bank. And then yes, eventually there will be a run on that bank and people will learn a valuable lesson. This process will repeat occasionally for the rest of time, because people are bad at learning from history. However, unlike today, everyone will have the option of being their own bank, and the smarter and wealthier among us will never trust our money to a bank.
Credit and lending does still work in the world where people are their own banks, it is just a bit different. People who want to earn interest on their holdings can invest their Bitcoin in a bank and in this case, to avoid a run the bank, they would have withdrawal rules, much like a modern CD. Banks will no longer have “Checkings” and “Savings” accounts where you can withdraw at will. Instead when you deposit money with a bank it will be specifically for the purpose of the bank lending that money and paying you interest.

Silver is not good money. It only served as money in the past because gold is too valuable to make small value coins with. A gold coin worth a loaf of bread would be minuscule. Once people started using gold backed paper currency this problem was solved and silver lost its use as money. 
Silver will never again be money because it is too easy to mine and has too many industrial use cases. This makes the stock to flow ratio for silver much too low to be good money. 
Litecoin will suffer the same fate as silver. Just like silver solved a shortcoming with gold, litecoin solves a shortcoming with Bitcoin. And just like silver lost it’s monetary status after the problem with gold was solved, litecoin will lose its monetary status after the problem with Bitcoin is solved. Today litecoin is only useful fo faster transaction times and lower fees, but one day Bitcoin will solve these problems and then litecoin will be worthless.

At all times, someone owns each piece of money. If you build a house and sell it, the money is going to come from the person who bought the house...
Wealth can grow without the money supply growing. Currency is only a small fraction of total wealth. 
And yes, I can extend you credit or lend you Bitcoin (or any other deflationary currency). Let's say I lend you 100BTC for 1 year at 10% interest, compounded annually. You pay me back 110BTC after 1 year. Over that year the value of BTC increased by 5%. Thus your effective interest rate is 15.5%. (Because the 110BTC you paid me back was actually worth deflation adjusted 115.5BTC)
As long as the deflation rate is suitably low, loans and credit still work. Now, if the deflation rate was 20%, then yea, no one is going to take a loan. But to achieve a long term deflation rate of 20% would require serious sustained economic growth.

Bitcoin cannot easily be used for all of those things. It can be used to buy votes, but it would be very hard to use it for the others.

Whether an ETF is backed by Bitcoins or Bitcoin futures doesn’t really matter that much. 
The reason for this is because futures are 2 party contracts. For every future that exists, someone is on the long side and someone is on the short side. Thus an ETF backed by futures means for that every dollar long invested into the ETF is a dollar long in Bitcoin futures, which is also means there is a dollar short in futures. It’s unlikely that there will be enough investors to cover the short position, and thus arbitragers will go short on the futures and buy real bitcoin to cover their short while collecting a small percentage for their efforts. 
Thus even though the ETF is technically backed by futures, in reality through the market mechanics, it does actually involve the buying and holding of actual bitcoins. 
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:38:37
It would be the dollars that are held in escrow, not bitcoin.

Some oneline store platforms (like Shopify) have a plug-in based payment processing system. For these platforms people have built several crypto payment plugins and thus with a few clicks you can accept crypto.
Square is not a pluggable system. Square is more of an all in one point of sale system and it is entirely controlled by Square. Square is really popular with small physical shops because it is easy to use and relatively cheap. Because these shops use Square not only to process payments, but they also program in their Menu/Products into the system and Square automatically feeds info to their accounting system, it is very unlikely that a shop using Square will also start using a third party crypto payment processor. 
So, all of these little shops/restaurants will start accepting crypto when Square starts accepting crypto.

Being the reserve currency and the petro-dollar are separate things. 
Reserve currency means that foreign central banks hold USD in reserve instead of gold. You can read about that here: 
The petro-dollar is the fact that major oil exporters sell oil for USD. This isn’t really related to reserve currency status. Instead they use USD in return for the US providing military defense. A country that sells lots of oil for USD doesn’t really have to worry about their own defense. Countries who support the petro-dollar are very successful while countries who challenge it end up collapsing. This is how the petro-dollar is maintained.

Bitcoin is based on the energy needed to mine it. This is a physical value of sorts, most interestingly is that Bitcoin can’t be debased. You can t take back the energy used to mine a Bitcoin. 
Not that this really matters though. More importantly Bitcoin is scarce by itself. We often talk about currency being backed by a physical good such as gold as a way to determine the scarcity of a currency. Backing with a physical good was a way to create scarcity, but with Bitcoin we get mathematical consensus based scarcity, so we dont need backing.

Actually they would be more likely to care about coins than bills because the coins cost a lot to make. Pennies and nickels specifically cost more than they are worth. Destroying them causes the treasury to need to make more, thus unnecessarily costing the treasury. Bills on the other hand cost only a very small percentage of their value to make. Destroying bills technically helps counteract inflation at a small cost to the treasury. 
That said, no one cares. Unless your melting down tons of pennies or nickels and selling the metals, no one cares. There is no way you could make even the tiniest dent in the money supply without destroying billions of dollars worth of currency. And I don’t know anyone who would destroy billions of their own money...

Cash settled futures don’t actually expand the Bitcoin supply. For a futures contract to exist there must be two parties: one going long and one going short. Thus for someone who wants to go long Bitcoin, if they use futures they will have to be paired with someone who wants to go short. 
Let’s consider the same scenario with actual Bitcoin. The bull buys 10 bitcoin and the bear borrows 10 bitcoin from the bull and sells them on the market. The net effect is zero. 
So it doesn’t matter if these people trade actual Bitcoin or cash settled futures.

If a government seized the domain they might auction it off, and I’m not sure that the new owner would be any better than Ver. I’d rather just stick with Ver because he might come around one day.

I think there is counter party risk though. Who pays the fees to close the channel? Is there a scenario where the other party to a channel can force you to pay a transaction fee to close? What if the network is congested and the fees are high?
The risk here is that you won’t collect enough fees from a channel to offset the fees to open/close the channel.

Just watch. The blocks that added value to your wallet are already in the chain. A split only affects future blocks. If you have 1 BTC in a wallet before a split you will have 1 BTC in the same wallet on 2 chains after the split.  If one chain dies everything is easy, but if they both live you have to "split" your coins at some point. There is no deadline to split, so if you are planning on holding straight through you can worry about this later.

Lol, just because you call it is "soft" fork doesn't mean it won't split the chain. Take your block size increase for example, it would split the chain because the existing nodes will reject any blocks larger than 1MB. This would yield 2 chains and everything I said will come into play.

$0.01/sat means a market cap of $20t. That’s not an absurd number for an asset that is the world wide standard for money. Gold is $8t, USD is $14t. 
Now let’s imagine that the USD loses 99% of its value. It has already done so once, I bet it does so again over the next 40 years. There is no other way the US can handle the debt, inflation is inevitable. 
Thus $1/sat is actually pretty likely. It’s just that when it gets there $1 will be worth 1% of what it is today.
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:08:40
The government debt can be made easier to pay back via inflation, but all outstanding debts owed to the Federal Reserve cannot be paid back as there is not enough USD. 
The Federal Reserve creates USD and then they lend it at interest to banks and the government. Let’s say there is no USD at all. Then the fed makes $100 and lends it to someone at 5% interest. One year passes and now the person owes the fed $105, but only $100 exist. Thus the person must take another loan from the fed to pay off the first loan. Over time the amount owed to the fed becomes much greater than the total amount of money. This is how the fed works.

No, because forks destroy the salability across time. There can only be one Bitcoin. There can only be one optimal money crypto currency. If another crypto supplants Bitcoin to take the top spot that would destroy Bitcoin’s salability across time. It would also set the precedent that a new crypto can supplant the leading crypto, destroying the salability across time for all crypto’s. 
This is a main part of the reasoning of Bitcoin maximalists. If Bitcoin fails, then no crypto currency can be expected to succeed. 
Also, there is no limit to forks. They are an unlimited resource. Unlimited resources make very poor money.

Some brokers allow you to have fractions of a share. Usually through their dividend reinvestment programs. But the way this works under the covers is that the broker holds an integer quantity of the stock and divides it among their customers. Exchanges only allow trades of whole shares, and some exchanges only trade in lots of 100 shares. 
Exchanges have no real incentive to change this, in fact their are incentivized to the opposite. Exchanges make money as a function of volume . With larger minimum trade sizes they make more money.

The only things the network can reach immutable consensus on are things that are in blocks. In the case of LN this means the channel opening transaction and the channel closing transaction. The network does not reach consensus on what happens on the channel between open and close. Depending on what implementation the participants of the channel are running there are ways to guess what is happening on a channel, but there is no way to know.

For fast payments use lightning. 
Another round of high fees will get another batch of high tx users to start batching. For example, I noticed recently that Gemini isn’t batching withdraws. 
Eventually exchanges and other bitcoin services will start doing a lot of their transactions on Liquid or LN.

Most people didn’t create Bitcoin and most people don’t use bitcoin and most people think bitcoin is stupid. I think you’re the idiot.

Doing this on a specific date is a terrible idea because it will cause block congestion and high fees. Also, he should be encouraging hardware wallets. 
That said, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Ledger and Trezor are pretty easy to use these days, there is no excuse. If you don’t have enough Bitcoin to justify spending on a hardware wallet, there are good and free wallet Apps like BRD. BRD even has the benefit of being an SPV wallet vs Ledger and Trezor which run off of trusted nodes.

The Ballad if Buster Scruggs. It is good, but not as good as this scene makes it look.

Lower fees are probably a result of 2 things:
1. High fees encouraged better fee estimating algorithms
2. High fees encouraged exchanges and other high transaction volume actors to improve their transaction efficiency to save money.

How can "private mining" be interpreted as anything other than a 51%/wipeout attack? No matter which chain they are mining, if they are successful, there will be a wipeout. Someone explain how it is possible that bitmain didn't just announce that they are planning to run an attack?

It would be cool if bitcoind could show it’s “seed ratio”
This could help people that are running non-mining nodes understand that until they hit 1.0 they have actually been a net drain on the network. 
Until you have uploaded more old blocks then you downloaded you haven’t contributed to the network. Thus, running a node is only a contribution to the network if you are going to commit to running it long term and you have your port forwarding setup correctly.
If you run a node only for a short time then you have placed a data upload burden on other nodes in the network and then never payed it forward.

For many plans you’ve been able to pay with Bitcoin and even lightning network though Bitrefill for quite some time.

I don’t know this for a fact, but I would bet a decent sum that cheap connector parts aren’t gold plated not because of the price of gold, but because of the time and expense of the plating process.

Saying that the value of Bitcoin derives from the cost to mine it is the same as the Labor Theory of Value, which is easily proven to be absolute bullshit. 
Also, apparently the author hasn’t ever heard of difficulty adjustment...

With the correct setup you could get the water a lot higher than 30C. Miners have a max air intake temp of 40C. Water is much more heat conductive than air so the max intake temp for water would be well over 40C. In the right configuration I wouldn’t be surprised if you could get 80C water exiting the system.

Well, if you want to run on an arduino your going to have to make some compromises. It is important to have the option to run a fully validating node, but that doesn’t mean we need to run full nodes on every one of our devices including our refrigerators and smart watches. At current block sizes it is very affordable to run a full node, as is documented by the countless Raspberry Pi full node tutorials. Practically any computer hardware built this millennium can handle it and the bandwidth requirements are negligible.

It’s an important feature because it is directly correlated with security and immutability.

Bitcoins “intrinsic value” is that it is almost perfect money. It has high salability across space, time and scales. The only place it falls short is true fungibility, and that can be fixed in a future update. 
Golds practical use cases are limited. Jewelry is not really that useful. Both silver and copper have better conductivity than gold, the only reason gold is used in electronics is because it has high conductivity AND does not corrode. But even if gold was plentiful it’s use in electronics wouldn’t increase because very little gold is needed for that purpose. The real value of gold derives from the fact that for most of human history it was the best available material to serve as money. And now Bitcoin is taking that seat. 
If you want to understand what money is and why “intrinsic value” is a meaningless phrase, I suggest reading The Bitcoin Standard.

Smaller blocks? What? If you’re that resource constrained there are plenty of strategies to use. Pruning, SPV, the protocol could be upgraded to include a hash of the UTXOs, etc. There are a lot of ways to make clients more efficient. We shouldn’t even be talking about smaller blocks.
