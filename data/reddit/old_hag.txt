IOTA can simply disallow your transaction or even freeze or seize your balance. Might as well use paypal except the fees.

Hate these lame comment chains. Breaking it up...

I prefer Bcore.
Seriously though, core has made a deliberate (and understandable) decision to not change capacity. Obviously wouldn't be universally popular, especially to those who don't know the scaling issues well.

Yes, it's a small but clever increase that will enable much more in future.

Nice non-argument. I also followed it closely and the political interference is unmistakable.

The hitman stuff wasn't conclusively shown to have been done by Ross. He might not be a saint but his sentence is a lot harsher than murderers and actual big time dealers get. Of course it's an attempt to make an example out of him, which is crazy (to expect that to work) at this stage in the war on drugs and is outright unjust.

There is reason to believe that Ross was not in control of the DPR account at all times. Many aspects of the case were twisted to achieve a desired outcome.

Cancerous and stupid beyond belief.

If the fee is too low (44sat/byte), it might never confirm. In this case you can make another transaction with higher fees.
The network hasn't been too busy lately so I would guess it will confirm eventually.

Bitcoin is secure because hashrate

Decentralisation is very important to prevent censorship, etc. If we don't trush the miners we should mine more ourselves. The problem is that no other buisness is competing with bitmain.
