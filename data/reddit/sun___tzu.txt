I want to propose SENS Research Foundation. If we want medicine to succeed in developing effective treatments for cancer, neurodegenerative disease, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, we need to finally start addressing the core problem of aging. The organisation is not being adequately pursued by major funding bodies, therefore our donations help to accelerate research. It's one of the world's most important problems because it causes the most suffering, and takes the most lives.

how is it a much lower prority? what are you using to measure this? If you look at what causes the most suffering, ageing / age related diseases cause 70 percent of deaths, and most of those deaths are not peacefully in bed but progressive and painful. In a very real and measureable way, the work SENS is working on is the worlds most important problem. Yes there are other problems in the world, and you have different people who work on different things, but the world is progressing on different issues in parallel. If you tried to stop all but 1 important problem of your choice so that that 1 gets focus, you would be slowing the rate that the world moves forward in general.

so you're saying that the whole world needs to focus on net neutrality and no one should work on making people healthier again? Even if it's the worlds most important problem when measuring the amount of suffering people go through, when knowing that 70 percent of people die from age related diseases, and it's usually not in your sleep peacefully but progressively with a lot of pain. I very firmly disagree with your points oh_here_we
