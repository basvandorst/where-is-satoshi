The fact that you claim this while using the most rudimentary example of IoT possible (smart light) shows me that you really don’t know much about the industry. There is a massive amount of business and government-facing tools/systems that fall under the category of IoT that are utilized today. The “internet of things” thrives in the field of data collection and analytics at the moment, we won’t see much expansion to larger scale IoT implementations until we get new telecom technology to allow for it (ie CAT M1, Verizon’s 5G, etc.), which is all improving rapidly. 
I guess people who have only ever heard it as a buzzword wouldn’t be seeing much about how their favorite store is tracking their foot traffic to optimize marketing techniques and business operation through the use of sensors, for example.

I disagree with the IoT example. That’s like saying that practical use of AI won’t be increasingly huge in the future. I do software engineering in the IoT space and the industry is certainly not slowing down. Maybe people just don’t have a good understanding of what it is?
As for quantum computing, I don’t recall there ever being a time in which the consensus was anything other than “this is far from being feasible, and will not be for a long time.”
