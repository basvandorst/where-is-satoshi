50k seems a bit heavy, holding 40% of your wealth in btc might be a bad time especially if you will be needing that money for living expenses in the next 24-36 months.
What are your expenses like?  If I was in your spot 10k would be about the max I would throw into btc.

You have been able to send people without wallets set up bitcoin for a while with coinbase to email address.  With both they eventually have to set up an account to collect. 
Nothing new here, except the ability to send it to random people commenting on a forum without their contact information is pretty big

also instant buys right?
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:14:00
do you believe everyone purchasing with BTC already was holding before and is not replenishing?  Because if not and they are either buying btc in order to take advantage of the sale, or transfering btc but buying more to continue holding I don't understand the effect. 
I think it is probably fairly close to neutral, btc spenders have to convert their fiat to btc at somepoint in the process they aren't just never getting back in, sellers converting back doesn't seem like a huge deal.  I think the 5% drop is much more likely to be linked to the weekend drop that seems to occur every week coupled with the fact this is a holiday weekend in the U.S.

No one can answer this unfortunately, there is no specific guidance out that I'm aware.  
My personal opinion is you would not create issues reporting this way so long as you are consistent in your method.  It is also unclear if wash loss applies to btc but that may be relevant for some of your trades. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:29:48
I doubt Circle purchases all their coins off market, I would be very suprised if some portion are not purchased on exhanges.  Coinbase relies on Bitstamp fairly heavily from whaat I've heard.

I will sell at certain points if the price rises, because I want my btc to usd wealth ratio measured in usd to be around a certain target.
If it falls I be holding to zero though.

Works like stock, pay tax when you move out of btc.

If you are paid in btc, you would have to include the $ value in gross income and then you would get the amount included as basis for when you move out of btc again.

While this isn't the model of the flat tax I would support I think one good reason is the estimated 6 Billion hours American's spend prepping their tax returns every year.
