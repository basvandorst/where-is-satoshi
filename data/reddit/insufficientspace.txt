True, but that event fed a news cycle narrative about bitcoin as a hedge against bail-ins.  That was a contributor to the price rise.
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:02:48
Just fyi...There is a CRC check code built into the bitcoin address. This makes it very hard for a typo to get through when you send the transaction.  The wallet should give an error if they made a typo and the address is invalid.

In a financial crisis, there are limited tools available to sovereign entities to stem the crisis.  Devaluation, bail-ins and capital controls are the go-to tools, Bitcoin counters them all.  We had a taste of how Bitcoin will react with the Cyprus bail-in event.  Bitcoin extends the basic properties of good money with extreme, no-cost portability, security and stealth.  These properties are extremely valuable in cataclysmic financial collapse.
TL:DR  Bitcoin is the life boat to escape a sinking ship.

I agree, BTC is supposed to be p2p, only 2 parties to a transaction.  With Bitpay, Coinbase et al, you inject a 3rd party, and if you use the "payment protocol" there is a 4th party for certificate verification.  Not in the founding spirit of Bitcoin IMHO.
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:15:36
no contest, BTC FTW.

Can't buy because Blockchain.info has been down for over 7 hours and all the skyhook BTM's are using their wallets!  On one of the best buying days in a long time! Someone needs to get these BTM's off of blockchain.info and start using bitcoinj or bitcoind so there's no 3rd party reliance.  This is a total  for blockchain.info.

This is the scenario if the feds come knocking.  The feds notify coinbase that your account is to be frozen, coinbase provides the mulitisig address to the feds, the feds monitor the blockchain.  Coinbase notifies you that your account is frozen by court order, you're no longer allowed to use the bitcoin funds.  You move your funds out of the multisig address using the recovery tool after you were notified your account was frozen.  The feds come arrest you and the blockchain records the proof of the violation.  They won't have your bitcoin, but they now have you.

Governments have tried and failed at this.  I guess the PBOC didn't get the memo.  See Mintchip and Auroracoin, both failed attempts at Govcoins.  But I agree, it helps condition folks to the idea of cryptocurrencies in general.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:11:25
You're correct, AuroCoin is more of a National Coin then a Govcoin.

The minimum fee should adapt dynamically, similar to the way difficulty adjust. 
The minimum fee to get included in the next block should follow a 1/(L-x) relationship.  Where L is the block size limit and x would be the average block size over say the last 100 blocks.  This would go to infinity as x approaches L and 1/L as x approaches 0.    Wallets could use the blockchain to get the size of the last 100 blocks and calculate the fee.  Miners would be incentivized to fill blocks to maximize mining fees.  If the network saturates, the fee will become prohibitively large quickly and then relax as traffic subsides.  Users would be incentivized to minimize the size of transactions or hold larger transactions until the fee relaxes.

I thought default and liguidation is the honest solution to a debt that can't be paid back (insolvent is the real problem).  The dishonest solution is inflation. This is not an option for the Greek government unless they exit the EMU and reintroduce their own fiat currency.  Bitcoin is a solution for individuals, with capital, that want to exit the monetary madness and dishonesty of fiat currencies.

Limits are there because of a bug in the design of the legacy financial system that enables easy fraud via identity theft.  This bug is irreparable and must be mitigated by draconian limits and ubiquitous surveillance.  Because of this, it is now trivially easy to weaponize the legacy financial system against political enemies and therefore, will be its ultimate downfall now that there is a viable private alternative.  People will not adopt bitcoin because they want to but because they have to.
