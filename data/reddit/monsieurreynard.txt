I think it’s the opposite. Or drug dealers wouldn’t use crypto.  The whole idea behind our increasingly crumbling (US)  laws around political donations is supposed to be to prevent anonymous or proxy or foreign contributions. In theory the very point is that the contributions should be “traceable” and publicly disclosed (Citizens United and other developments have undermined this, although we just regained a little ground last week).
Crypto may be traceable, but it allows front end anonymity that makes it very dangerous as a form of political contribution. Smart move. 
Of course so does cold hard fiat cash. And we have laws about handing out bags of that to politicians too. 
Also I do wonder what hand the Russians play in the crypto boom.  Destabilizing national economies would be an obvious extension of what they’re doing now at the electoral and cultural levels:

It happens extremely rarely and is now under attack.  Court ruling just made it much harder. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:36:39
I buy new cars, not Lambos of course. The extra $5000 gets you a lot of nice things. I ain’t going broke, either way, and I’ve never owned crypto. 
If $5-10k is a shit ton of money to you, buy used.
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:46:49
lol ok and you’d trust these “services” with your PAYCHECK?
anonymity whatever 
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:28:48
Wait you’re seriously proposing someone needs to run a bitcoin node to sell a used car? And here I thought crypto was about making transactions simpler. 
Most Americans can’t set up a smartphone.
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:44:49
Lol ok. 
Do you self-insure your assets for up to $250k too?
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:43:02
Grovel? The bank grovels for your deposits.
What planet do you people live on and have you ever had any real wealth to your name that wasn’t just play money?
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:35:48
Buying a car anonymously is basically impossible if you plan to register and drive it. You’re gonna owe taxes too.
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:30:36
That’s what cash is
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:43:32
Right, carry a USB drive with all your money on it instead. Much safer. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:31:42
So you’re saying cash is ideal! Fast, free, anonymous, portable.
Although buying a car or house can’t be an anonymous transaction without being illegal.
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:41:10
All of your examples are marginal. And rare. Massive losses in crypto due to lost keys and wallets are far more common, never mind rampant outright fraud and theft. 
I’ll stick with banks and the FDIC. I’ve never ever lost a dime or had any issue accessing my funds or transferring them promptly in 40+ years of banking.
You kids go right ahead and play with your funny money. If you had real wealth you’d be more cautious.
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:47:21
Legally false 
@_date: 2019-03-08 03:47:54
How many times a year do you buy a car?
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:37:30
Right because banks don’t have computers or IT departments. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:33:50
Says a poor person. 
It’s pocket change difference to me and I like the new car smell and knowing my ass is the first on the seat.
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:31:08
Same. I move money around by ACH transfer all the time. It costs me nothing and takes a day or two at most. The funds are FDIC insured on both ends of every transaction. I have never lost funds in a transfer. Never paid for a transfer. Never seen my funds lost value between send and receive. Works perfectly.
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:51:20
Course it ain’t worth anything but ok
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:33:21
That doesn’t happen with an ACH transfer. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:28:12
You show up with anything but cold hard fiat cash or cocaine and I’m not showing you my used car. That’s why. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:42:03
Lol wut?
Once a month I go into my bank and withdraw $3500 in cash. Done it every month for years.
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:31:07
After losing 10% in three days or whatever.
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:35:12
Umm some of us still use fax machines as they are far more secure than email. Exactly the same reasoning applies. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:44:20
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:31:30
Lol. Yes I’m a zombie. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:47:34
Why was he paying for a car with a card?
And don’t those security precautions protect your business from fraud too?
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:36:57
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:49:13
Do it all the time. Never had a problem.
Carrying around your assets on a thumb drive, now that’s secure!
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:50:48
This. Your friend entered his banking password on a a stranger’s laptop.
 This is the crypto brain trust. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:19:52
$2.5 million
No wait, $2 million 
OK $1.5 million but that’s my...
$750,000 take it or leave it
Will you pay my taxes? If so it’s yours! 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:29:47
Because they bought high and can't deal psychologically with all that money being gone for good. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:56:20
Ding! We has a winner! 
@_date: 2019-01-19 12:04:40
That gives me so much confidence in the future of Crypto! Panamanian banks and Venezuelan ATMs. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:18:53
First prize for effort. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:17:03
Yeah I'd love to make 20% in three months on any investment too.  
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:04:38
And they say male students never do the laundry.

Not a Mad Max wasteland, just a risky place to buy property. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:57:23
An advantage eliminated by volatility. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:28:02
There’s where you are wrong. Plenty of rich idiots out there. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:27:12
Buffett for many years famously drove a ten-year old Buick (or Oldsmobile or something of the sort). Himself. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:52:31
I was joking. It’s a thing we Americans do. Maltese may lack a sense of humor, but then again some of them believe bitcoin is ever going back again. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:00:36
Any day now. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:50:00
Smart rats. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:27:31
Yep. Same thing if your employer gives you a parking space or a tuition reimbursement. It’s income and has a market value. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:59:37
Only if states collapse.
@_date: 2018-12-27 14:03:49
That seems like a perfect idea. 
Here fam. All you have to do to get rich is smash my skull in.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:26:15
Precious little insults. Amazing how millions of lawyers and political scientists are all so uneducated and you know the real truth huh?
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:08:22
You were.!
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:56:11
Lol. Spewing insults only reinforces my impression of your sad sad existence.
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:40:03
Just be patient. When it’s $28 you’re gonna get rich.

You seem to be ignoring the small issue of state power and monopoly on violence. 
Bitcoin has no army. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:37:45
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:50:40
How would that work?
