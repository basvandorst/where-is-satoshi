The price doubled.  Lots of old equipment that had been turned off and/or underclocked were turned back on/overclocked.  Plus the new S7s came out just around the time of the price increase, so we had a lot of new hardware getting turned on at the same time.

They produce a lot of zero tx blocks.  It's not an error, it's eloipool's design.  It sends a blank template of work out first, then a new template a little later that contains transactions, as a hack around poor performance when blocks change.

Just to add in simpler/non-extreme terms:
Jurisdiction can be established in other states by the act of doing business with residents of that state, because there has never been a law limiting/defining differences between regular commerce and eCommerce.  Look up "long arm statutes" for an idea.  In essence, it's the fact that states can claim jurisdiction for actions done outside of their state "with sufficient connection" to the state trying to prosecute.  BitLicense attempts to define "sufficient connection" as dealing with New York residents in any capacity defined by the BitLicense.
It is worded specifically to attempt to gain nationwide (technically worldwide) jurisdiction unless you refuse to do business with NY residents.  Non-US companies will likely ignore it, because it's unlikely that the NYDFS is ever going to bother trying to prosecute a foreign company for this.  But any company within the US that might fall under the BitLicense is at risk, because it is *trivial* for NY to attempt to enforce these regulations across state lines. 
You might even win the lawsuit if they attempt it...but you're unlikely to get your legal fees reimbursed.

Expanding on the "at least for internal use" bit:  BTC Guild's coinbase actually has a not-so-secret identifier in it's coinbase identifying the server.  The 2 hex characters before the part that translates to "Mined by BTC Guild" are an identifier of which instance of the pool software discovered the block.  It's also used as a way to guarantee that under no circumstances would two instances of the pool software ever have an identical coinbase being worked on.

Downstream bandwidth has been increasing rapidly, but upstream has not.  And upstream *WILL NOT* increase as rapidly because there is no consumer demand for it.
Upstream bandwidth already averages 80-90% slower than downstream, with the only exception being *some* fiber offerings being symmetrical, but that is the exception not the rule.
This rate of doubling will outright kill the ability to solo mine and contribute to the network [full nodes] in any meaningful way unless the person is willing to put/rent servers in a datacenter.

1) Timestamps on blocks are unreliable.  Similarly, blockchain.info's "first seen" timestamp is often broken so you can't use that reliably either.
2) Some mining software doesn't update to new work unless it's required (new block entirely).  So sending out a blank template and then sending a filled in one later means some miners will continue to work on that blank template much longer than they should.

@_date: 2015-06-16 00:55:01
This is slightly incorrect.  PPLNS earnings are just like proportional in that users are only paid when blocks are solved.  So this attack actually hurts all miners on the pool just like proportional.
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:56:08
Luck in this context is the comparison of how many shares per block the pool is going through versus how many you would expect on average.
It is hard to say whether it is statistically deviating far enough to be anything other than variance (that's something organofcorti is extremely good at calculating/explaining).  But both BTC Guild and Eligius are roughly 11% under the number of blocks they would be expected to find in the last 90 days.  Since both pools are under 3% of the entire network, that might not be a big enough sample to rule out simple variance instead of moving on to potential attacks/bugs in miner software.
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:24:52
Boiling a frog analogy is great for this one.   People freaked out because BTC Guild grew almost overnight, and continued to expand to speeds the network had never dreamed of just months before.  It was almost the only pool used by early ASIC deployments.
Fastforward a year, and China starts to have pools/private farms taking up a moderate share of the network.  Then month by month they continue to gain overall share.  Nobody bats an eye at the fact that a year after that process starts, China is 60%+ of the network.
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:04:16
And yes, it's an interesting change, but I was expecting it all the way back then.  BTC Guild was only so large be cause the first ASICs were using BTC Guild (it was the most compatible/reliable pool for them for a long time).
But the majority of that hashrate was located in China, so as soon as Chinese based pools starting showing up it was obvious that we were going to see a *huge* shift in centralization towards China.
@_date: 2015-12-06 09:38:15
Yes, but they also have sizeable private mining farms of their own.  As posted above, close to 20% of the network we KNOW is privately controlled by 2 entities (BitFury and KNC).
AntPool also has a pretty large farm of their own, but the exact size is not publicly disclosed.  Considering their hardware powers the majority of miners out there, I'd be surprised if they're not close to (or above) 10% of the network with their own private hardware.
F2Pool/Discus Fish almost certainly has some farm as well, that pool became a large share of the network basically out of nowhere in its early days.  Pools don't see that size of massive hash power shift to them unless they own (or have agreements with) a large private mining farm.
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:03:56
It's crazy to think that wasn't very long ago.  It's a good highlight of one of the reasons I recommend BitMinter and Eligius as well.  Luke-Jr is the one who grabbed my attention once the forking was noticed.
The "old timers" have always been good at keeping in contact with each other for emergencies.  For the most part it's always been an atmosphere of friendly competition between the older pools, rather than adversarial.  These days it's almost been like comrades on the sinking ship as we've all continued to lose share to private farms and chinese pools.
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:26:19

"We ran a SQL SELECT SUM(btc_balance) query on the user_proﬁles table to determine the total outstanding balances."
Did you run a similar statement to check for accounts holding negative balances which could be used internally to hide employee/owner withdrawals?  This would keep the SUM matching the amounts held, but means they don't actually have enough to meet their *real* liabilities to customers.

ASICs hurt decentralization for a simple reason.  ASICs are a VERY cheap to manufacture product once you have the development cost done, which the mining community happily paid for them via pre-orders.  The entities that make ASICs can build up their share of the network for pennies on the dollar compared to anybody else.

Bitcoin users have many choices.  There are plenty of pools out there.  Adding another one is not going to accomplish anything when it comes to 51% threats.
One thing DirectPool is definitely doing no other pool does:  Spamming the hell out of Reddit &amp; Bitcointalk with threads/posts/"press releases" claiming to be "next generation" while being no different from the other choices, and making the claim that they are doing anything about the 51% threat.
To date, only one pool has ever done anything about the 51% threat.  The same one you keep posting that BS reddit thread about:  BTC Guild.  Deepbit hit 51% in the past and did nothing.  Luckily that didn't last too long.  BTC Guild WOULD HAVE hit 51%, but made active changes to encourage users to leave before that ever happened, and had a posted outline of additional measures that would have happened if the pool continued to grow after those changes.

The IRS is not a boogeyman.  I've been through many audits for clients when I worked in a CPA office.  They don't send a trained assassin out to hunt you down for every paperclip you took from the office for personal use.  They're there to identify tax evasion, either innocently or purposefully.
If they find something, they'll note it, and see if there is a pattern of similar omissions from income or inconsistencies with reporting.
As an individual, the only way you're going to get nailed is if you have obvious omissions from your income.  If they audit your personal bank statements and find a series of deposits that aren't from your employer, they'll ask about it.  If they see a brand new car or television with no significant withdrawal from your bank account, they'll ask about it.
The "taxed on my cup of coffee" argument being put out there is taking what the IRS said to it's literal extreme, and in no way is it likely to ever come to that unless YOU do something specifically to piss off an auditor.

To be fair, it has only happened once.  The next time (if there ever is one), it probably won't be a fee raise but something else.  However, ~35% of the network is privately controlled now.

It's because most pools consider the 0.00001 fee in 0.9 to be spam and continue to use 0.0001.  0.00001 is small enough to make the risk of orphaning a block due to the larger block size outweigh the gain from the fee itself.

ASIC resistance is a marketing term for crappy altcoins to justify their existence.
Scrypt coins started as "CPU coins" that were hostile to all the GPU miners that took over Bitcoin at the time.  Then somebody figured out how to mine them on GPU, so they changed the marketing term to "ASIC resistant", claiming that ASICs couldn't be made for them due to memory requirements and other invalid reasons.  Then after the last cryptocoin rally there was enough value in Litecoin+other scryptcoins to justify ASICs, and now we have scrypt mining ASICs.
If any other random algorithm coin becomes valuable, ASICs *will* be made for them.

Bitstamp is guaranteed to be one source of the list used to send these emails.

You can assume coin loss will settle down to an approximate percentage of all coins in circulation over time.  You'll never know the exact amount.  Obviously it's not as simple as 0.1% of coins are lost each year.  Some years will be worse than others.  The problem is there will ALWAYS be coins leaving the system permanently due to end user stupidity.
But if a small number of coins is constantly going into the system, the rate of inflation shrinks with each new coin.  Eventually this rate of inflation will be equal to the rate of coin loss, creating a net zero for effective inflation.

The risk is very small, but it is there, and it is lowering profits for pools/miners by a very small (fractions of a percent) amount over a very long time frame.
That's why I said it's mostly just a factor of pools being "nice", or you might consider it a very long-term investment (larger blocks today = faster transaction processing).  If the transactions get confirmed marginally faster, maybe a small sliver of new adopters will join, producing a minor acceleration in adoption (and possibly value).

All the connections will go to HAProxy.  HAProxy can be set into one of many different load balancing configurations which will forward that connection to a different (virtual) machine.  As far as the other nodes are concerned, they're connected to different machines (though it's still one public IP).
This is how load balancing works.  Connect to BTC Guild's stratum service, your connection will be handled on one of 6 different backend servers, all handled through a single public IP.  That connection remains constant as well unless you disconnect the session and start a new one.  This same setup works in a home NAT as well.

My *only* nitpick with Andreas on this was how quickly he let them reduce his crime counterpoint to "good outweighs the bad".  When they mentioned it a few times, he should have reminded them that wasn't his **only** argument, which is how it was coming across the second and third time it was brought up.
I really did like that he kept emphasizing the point that regulation should only target the companies that are using traditional (custodial) style financial services, making specific exceptions when that is not the case.  If only the NYDFS were nearly as receptive to that argument as the Candian senate appeared to be.

This is exactly why so many people operate an independent store while simultaneously having a presence on eBay/Amazon.  eBay and Amazon are extremely close in fees (on low cost items, eBay+PayPal was better IIRC).
You use Amazon and/or eBay as a marketing vehicle for your store, essentially it is free advertising as long as you market your items at or above cost (+ fees) on eBay/Amazon.  Include a small marketing paper/invoice with your shipments letting customers know that they could get even better deals directly.
You pass some of the savings onto your customers when they shop directly, incentivizing direct purchases, while also providing you with higher profits due to the lack of commissions.

Except...they didn't go from 47% to 35%.  Their hash rate barely changed at all.  They simply had a lucky day followed by an unlucky day.
A 51% attack is when their HASH RATE is more than 51%.  Not when they solve &gt; 51% of blocks in a 24 hour period.  A pool can get 51% of blocks in a 24-hour period with 35-40% of the hash rate if they're lucky.
At 51% *hash rate* they can ALWAYS produce &gt; 50% of blocks eventually, which is where the problem exists.  It's the fact that 51% hash rate is a guarantee you will succeed.

Originally, you could argue a conversion rate between the integer operations used in mining and floating point operations because with GPUs you knew the effective hash rate of a GPU and you knew the FLOPS of that GPU.  People could the extrapolate the "effective FLOPS" of the Bitcoin network by assuming a certain average conversion rate of hash rate -&gt; FLOPS since the entire network was GPUs (95%+ GPU, &lt;5% CPU+FPGA).
ASICs have changed that.  Mining ASICs perform at ~0 (maybe there's something in there doing a few?) FLOPS, and power the *VAST* majority of the Bitcoin network.  It is probably slower today (in FLOPS capacity) than it was 2 or 3 years ago because GPUs have been completely replaced.

I have no misunderstanding.  The 51% attack/vulnerability is very specific.  That is the point where an entity can guarantee they will be able to force a block chain fork and win.  It can be used to double spend, or simply guarantee that the entity solves 100% of the blocks by orphaning any chain where a competing entity solves a block instead of them.

The newly generated coins relay should match the block relay every time.  A new coin generation is only broadcasted as part of a block.  If they're not matching...blockchain.info is even more broken than I was aware of.
Again, the IP you see has NO relation to the source unless they have a direct connection to blockchain.info *and* that connection was the first time blockchain.info saw it (in a p2p network, that is not always the case).

Just a tip:  While most brokerage firms will send you 1099-Bs, they will rarely provide you with the detail needed to properly report your capital gains.  They generally only report the gross proceeds and applicable fees to the IRS.  This is because the 1099-B rules do not require them to actually track your cost basis, so they simply don't.  Which makes filing taxes involving 1099-Bs a complete pain in the ass because they don't provide you with all the information you need on the form.
In the end, you're still probably going to need some kind of spreadsheet or accounting software to actually track your cost basis and then apply your sales to them using FIFO (generally).  The only difference between getting a 1099-B and not is that the IRS will have a third party document to verify/compare your gross sales amount to.

This could be great news if it works as intended.  Right now the size of blocks is basically a  factor of how "nice" the pools are.  Most pools are producing blocks larger than the optimal size at this time, but that may not last when the subsidy is halved again.
("Optimal size" meaning that most pools are including at least some fee-less transactions, and some very low-fee transactions even though larger blocks = higher chance at orphan blocks)

More like we need regulations that are specifically tailored to Bitcoin and separate it from existing regulations.  The real issues come from trying to retrofit old regulations to deal with new technology.
It is common for that for retrofitting to also be retroactive (see IRS guidance).  While some businesses will assume old rules are in play, even professionals in the industry will disagree on which parts apply and which parts don't.  The IRS guidance was exactly how I expected them to act, so I was already recording my transactions that way, but there was dissension even among CPAs for that one.  However, the IRS was very clear that these rules were already in play, meaning they applied from the beginning of Bitcoin's inception.

The problem here is there is too much open to interpretation, and the NY government has the luxury of shopping for a judge willing to attempt the case.  The act of attempting it would bankrupt me.
Yes, simply opening a browser is not a nexus.  But the NY users of the pool are running equipment (in NY presumably).  Is that now a nexus?  And then they receive their cut of the blocks that were solved from the pool, so they're receiving something from the pool as well.  Is that creating a nexus?  Historically, all states of broadened what defines a 'nexus' in order to expand their own power.

I know it shouldn't need to be said but:  Don't take your tax advice from a Forbes.com article.
Capital gains/losses apply for coins where you have a basis.  This generally means only coins which you purchased with fiat.  There's an exception where capital gains can apply to miners (below).
PSA for miners: It's a COMPLETELY different and significantly more complex reporting requirement.  If you are reporting mining income as capital gains, you WILL lose in an audit unless you've done some *significant* accounting work which includes filing a Schedule C and reporting the coins as income at the price when they were acquired (not the price when sold/lost), and using that as your basis for future capital gains/losses, generally using FIFO or LIFO accounting for each sale.
In both cases:  Your loss is limited to how much you put in.  Either the fiat you invested originally, or the total income you recognized on your Schedule C to establish your cost basis in the coins.

Yep, it was BTC Guild.
I posted a complete breakdown of the actions BTC Guild would take if it continued to approach 51%, starting with a fee hike to the PPS side of the pool, then moving to closed registrations for new users, and finally forced user migration if the pool actually crossed 51%.  The fee increase took effect, and the pool did close new registrations briefly.  Then ASICMINER went solo and the threat was gone.
The problem with GHash.io is 40-60% of their speed isn't even controlled by miners, it's their own private/cloud farm.  Their own private farm has been larger than any other pool since the latter half of 2013.  Their public pool side has been roughly on par with Discus Fish and BTC Guild.

The problem is there's no reliable timestamps in Bitcoin.  You have the timestamp of the block header, which can vary based on if the pool's clock agrees with yours.  Additionally, miners are able to update the timestamp on blocks if the pool allows it (all stratum pools do, and I believe GBT will as well), but not all miner clients do.  As a result, you can end up with block timestamps in the header that are quite a bit earlier than the time it was actually solved.
The problem with using the time the block was relayed in an orphan race is your block won't get relayed by nodes that already saw the other block.  This means it can take significantly longer for a site like blockchain.info to see your orphaned block due to how few nodes are actually pushing your block through the network.
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:17:07
getblocktemplate, as far as pooled mining is concerned, is meaningless.  It's just as centralized as stratum or the original getwork pools.
There is no single pool implementation that allows for GBT miners to pick or exclude transactions from the work that the pool provides.  This is because it is not possible to do in a way that doesn't completely saturate the bandwidth of the pool server with any reasonable number of miners.
  Miners would have to upload the entire raw block contents for every share they submit and the pool would have to verify all of those transactions with their local bitcoind if miners were able to pick their own block contents.  At best, the pool could provide a list of all transactions and the miner could pick them.  If they were enumerated, the miner could submit a list of the ones which were excluded (or the ones that were included), so that the pool could rebuild the block.  That would still likely take too much CPU on the pool to do, since every time a user submitted a share it would have to rebuild the merkle branches for their submissions, requiring a very large number of SHA256 hashes done on the server side in order to validate each share.

Your first problem:  You're listening to blockchain.info for what the source of blocks are in terms of names vs Unknown.
Your second problem:  You're looking at relay IPs which don't have any relevance to the source unless blockchain is actually connected to the mining node.
"Unknown" block sources are not nearly as big as blockchain.info suggests.  Blockchain.info is a TERRIBLE source of information for block sources, they still list multiple Deepbit blocks every week yet they haven't found a block since November of 2013 last I checked.
organofcorti has done a lot of research and has identified the actual sources (name of pools/companies) of all but a few % of the blocks.  The actual "Unknown" amount is less closer to 5-7%.  And that includes solo miners which will always be "Unknown".

Ah the joys of and their complete lack of understanding of how inaccurate and unreliable blockchain.info's charts are, especially under a 24-hour time span.
GHash.io's speed has barely moved since yesterday.  They simply had a lucky day yesterday and an unlucky day today.  Blockchain.info's chart is purely block solve based, it has NOTHING TO DO WITH HASHRATE.
A 51% attack is when an entity's HASH RATE is more than 51% of the network.  That is when you are guaranteed to always be able to orphan other blocks.  An entity can have &gt; 51% of the blocks on a given day with only 35-40% of the network hash rate if they get lucky.  But that isn't a 51% attack.  51% attack/vulnerability is when you are guaranteed to be able to orphan the rest of the network by building a longer chain on demand.  That is only doable with certainty with 51% HASH RATE.

I still strongly believe that a cap on the coins is a bad move for the longevity of Bitcoin, purely due to coin loss (deleted wallets, forgotten encryption passwords, etc).  You can assume that a certain percentage (not a full %) will be lost year over year.  Keep the block halvings for the next 20 years, that is fine.  But put a minimum floor value of 1 BTC/block (which would happen around 2031).
This would keep an extremely small (relatively) trickle of new currency coming into circulation, which over time would eventually be matched by the average annual coin loss.  The effective inflation rate would be 52,560 BTC per year, aproximately 0.3% of the total coins in circulation as of the time that halving would occur.  This is the absolute inflation rate, not the effective one, since the actual rate of coin loss isn't known.
Eventually it would reach equilibrium with coin loss and be an effective 0% inflation.

Not sure why you got a downvote here.  It's a valid question.
All of my references were in the case of an audit.  The ONLY way you're going to get in trouble for Bitcoin is if you're audited (same for doing a lot of business in cash).
When audited, they will go through your personal bank statements assuming the audit is you personally.  This can also happen if they audit a business in which you are a majority owner, since that is a major source of tax fraud (getting paid under the table personally for work done by your business).

Needs to happen, but needs future expansion built in at a reasonable rate.  Dynamic block size adjustment is extremely unlikely to work given how centralized mining is (and will always be, unfortunately).
At 0.5% increase every 2016 blocks (tie in with diff changes), you double the maximum block size every 5 years.  Assuming we start at 20MB blocks, this is a pretty reasonable increase (100MB blocks around early 2028, 1 gig blocks just before the mining subsidy drops to under 1 BTC/block).  It gives a steady rate of increase which is a lot better than sudden jumps.
Maybe that won't be sufficient, but it's a a lot better than increasing the size once and then needing another hard fork in 5 years to do it again.

It was estimated in the past by myself to be approximately half of their speed.  A few weeks after that, they released a public announcement identifying it as roughly 45%.
Their continued growth at a pace just slightly than the rest of the network indicates that their private farm is staying on target, or slightly growing since that time.  New hash rate generally appears with a mostly even distribution among other pools.  It actually generally favors BTC Guild and Eligius historically because they are the two most stable Stratum and GBT implementations respectively, meaning newly developed hardware tends to point at them, and will often default to those pools.  GHash.io's continued growth at a pace above a proportional distribution is the indicator that their private farm continues to grow.

The linked document, if real, is a subpoena.  We don't have information on WHAT was requested or why, or who the case is against.
For example:  BTC Guild received a subpoena related to Mt Gox litigation many months ago.  The subpoena requested any account information belonging to Mt. Gox (and some of the individuals/related companies) that they may had used for mining on the pool.  It could be a similar case for this CEX/GHash subpoena.
On the other hand:  GHash is running an exchange both for mining contracts (GH/s is an indefinite contract for the proceeds of an asset), and for altcoins.  So the SEC could very well be going after them on that front.

That reduces variance, it does NOT make them more money.  Their pool still makes no financial sense.
It would make sense if their private farm was 1-2 PH/s and they were letting others join to reduce their variance.  However, their private farm is as large as the 2nd largest pool on the network.  Their solo mining variance would be non-existent.

The $35 -&gt; $2 decline was scary because it was the first time BTC broke out beyond $1-parity, and was followed by a HUGE crash, a much smaller bounce back, and then a decline that lasted over a year.
The fear came from the fact that number of people involved in Bitcoin grew (as a percentage) more during that early 2011 ramp up than it has during any other bubble, and as a result a larger percentage of the community was burned and began to abandon it.

The idea is not that they can't catch up, or that they won't ever make blocks, it's that the smaller less-connected miners are basically time-delayed by the propagation time.    For every 6 seconds it takes them to be current with the network, they're effectively losing 1% of their hashrate.  This will reduce difficulty by the "lost" hashrate, which means the well-connected/larger miners will make up a bigger portion of the effective network hashrate since they're not working at such a disadvantage.
It's basically the same as selfish-mining where you delay putting out your block in order to give yourself a headstart on the next one.  Once you're a certain size, it is statistically likely that you will come out ahead.

Just so you know, approximately half of GHash.io's speed is their private farm.  Their private farm is actually larger than any other competing pool on its own.
If they attempted to do anything nefarious, it COSTS THEM NOTHING.  They LOSE money running their pool because it has ZERO income (unless they're stealing from users/skimming).
Doing a 51% attack would cost them their pool miners leaving.  That means nothing to ghash.io, it would actually save them operating costs.  Their private large enough that the "miners reduce their variance" argument isn't there.

All miners do not lose equally from orphaned blocks.  Larger miners have an advantage in orphan races, and so do geographic regions.  Right now, more than 50% of the network's hash rate is in China.  They have significantly better latency between their own nodes than the rest of the network, meaning that miners in China would have fewer orphans than miners outside of China.
Similarly, larger pools are at a huge advantage with shorter block times for the same reason.  If a pool is a large share of the network, they are going to win a larger percentage of orphan races they are involved in.

Because ASICs are quite literally the end game for specialized computing.  We have chips that are designed specifically to do one thing, and one thing only, as fast as we can push electrons through them.  The only way to do it any faster is to make the transistors even smaller, or push more of them through it at once (more pipelines, lower efficiency due to heat).
CPU -&gt; GPU was a massive leap because GPUs are designed for doing a huge number of simple operations in parallel.  FPGAs were a big leap in efficiency because they could reduce the overhead due to GPUs being designed to do far more than mining required.  ASICs were a huge leap in speed/efficiency over FPGAs because we are making computer chips that have no junk in the way.  They don't do anything else like GPUs, they don't have the FPGA overhead of being reprogrammable.  An ASIC will only ever do one thing, and it will do it as fast as possible.
Nothing exists in computing beyond an ASIC at doing one task as efficiently as possible.  There is no way to shortcut the process required to perform Bitcoin hashes, meaning the entire limit on Bitcoin mining speed lies in how small we can make the ASIC chips.  We're currently in the 20nm-28nm phase.  It is possible to go smaller, Intel is able to go as low as 14nm currently.  The cost to go to that size is SIGNIFICANT compared to 20-28nm, to the point that it is not economically feasible to do it, the cost per GH/s simply isn't worth producing it.

Not unless you were really lucky.  A difficulty 1 (or better) hash is a blockhash with at least 32 sequential 0-bits at the front of the hash.  That means the odds are 1 in 4,294,967,296 (4.2 billion).  Since a block hash is 2 rounds of SHA256, you'd need to do 8,589,934,592 rounds of SHA256 to perform that many block header hashes.  Maybe you'll get it off your first 2.  Maybe you won't get it after 50 billion rounds of SHA256.
Plus the orphan rate would be abysmal!  I would bet it takes quite a long time to do a SHA256 hash by hand, just imagine if a new block came in mid-calculation!  You'd have to start all over!
EDIT:  And that's assuming you're only doing the actual block header hash  by hand.  If you add in building the block header, I'd be surprised if very many people could even build a proper block header and then one hashing attempt before a new block hits the network and you have to start all over.

Not until a difficult adjustment happens, which is based on every 2016 blocks.  If the fork happens right after a difficulty adjustment, it would take over a month before an adjustment happens.  Possibly many months because hash rate will likely continue to move to XT in this event, meaning you will probably have much less than 25%.

The 0.8 hardfork had nothing to do with which side Mt. Gox was on.  0.8 was a complete accident caused by a bug in old implementations.
As a result We had two forks going:  One had rules that everybody could agree on without requiring any wallet software to be changed.  One had rules that only people on the 0.8 software would properly support.  The only smart choice was to revert to the one that would allow all wallets, merchants, and exchanges to work.
This is different from a blocksize change because the blocksize change is something that is actually attempting to be planned/rolled out, not something that causes an old version to break by complete accident.

The fork never happens until a block exists on Bitcoin XT that is invalid on Bitcoin Core (AKA:  &gt; 1 MB block that breaks Core rules).
Even if XT agrees that the &gt;1MB block limit is now in place, it has not forked until a block comes along that actually does that, because that is when Bitcoin Core will reject a block that XT accepts.
After that point, you can never submit a block to both chains while mining because the previous block hash will be different between the two chains.

I've always felt that Bitcoin would have benefited from a permanent inflation rate at 1 BTC/block once the halving reached that point.  This would add 144 BTC/day, 52560/year.  This amounts to about a 0.2% annual inflation rate at the 21M BTC mark.  Over time, the inflation, when measured as a percentage of total minted coins, would seem like nothing more than a rounding error.
Meanwhile, the real benefit would be it prevents the slow death of coins, as it is a GUARANTEE that some percentage of coins will be forever lost each year.  At some point a 1 BTC/block permanent reward would reach equilibrium with the amount of coins lost each year.

I'm not saying it needs to be changed, nor am I suggesting it.
I am calling out that it was a dumb idea to not include a virtually insignificant amount in blocks instead of halving to absolute 0, to offset the fact that a digital  currency can be lost and not recovered like physical currency.  It was shortsighted to make a currency where the actual supply can never be known because tens of thousands of coins (probably hundreds of thousands by now) were destroyed in the first few years because they were of such insignificant value that a wallet with a few thousand coins was a toy, not a retirement account.

Sites like blockr.io are only returning public addresses *that have been used*.  As such, you have quite a bit of uniqueness just from the first 8 characters, and for a large percentage of addresses, that's probably all you would need (currently) to find them.
As QuasiSteve mentioned, you wouldn't expect many 8-character searches to return multiple addresses UNLESS they share a common vanity word as the start.
For math purposes:  2,207,984,167,552 are the number of potential addresses (58^7), assuming an equal distribution of the first 7 unique characters in an address.  While this is a classic "birthday problem" type case of finding matches, meaning the odds of a duplicate are significantly higher than you would think, you're still dealing with over 2 trillion potential addresses in a fairly small (relatively) ecosystem.

If Deepbit ever was over 50% (I don't remember them actually hitting that point), it was only early on when there really weren't other pools at all, or during one of the 2011 DDoS sprees where major pools were going up/down for days at a time causing short term consolidation on whatever pool wasn't offline.  Outside of that, I don't recall them ever being 50%+ of the network.  A few lucky days causing a 24 hour chart to show them over 50%, but never *actually* having over 50% of the network.
GHash was only over 50% when they maintained/were partnered with one of the largest private farms at the time.  Publicly controlled hash rate on GHash was never a significant part of the network.  They got completely crushed by Chinese ASICs/private farms and couldn't keep up in the arms race.

I can tell you exactly why.  If you hack a company, you can get data, product information, trade secrets, personnel/customer databases, etc.  All valuable stuff for blackmail or black market selling, both of which have inherent risks in turning your hack into profit.
If you hack a Bitcoin company, you have the ability to take something of value immediately that requires no additional risk to convert into money.  Bitcoin services are a wet dream for blackhats.  It's literally a case of hack site, receive payday.
Most of the DDoS attacks on Bitcoin companies come in three forms:  
1) Login/brute force attack causing a Layer 7 DDoS.  Basically slamming servers in a way that dramatically slows them down (or renders them useless for most people), which at the same time is attempting to get into people's accounts.  Cloudflare _TREMENDOUSLY_ helps with this one.  
  
2) Heavy traffic DDoS used to mask other attempts at getting into a server.  Basically filling any security logs will huge amounts of garbage to hide the actual attempts.
3) MASSIVE traffic DDoS designed to take a site completely offline.  These are the least common, but happen quite a lot.  Depending on the type of Bitcoin business, this could be espionage, it could be revenge (banned/blacklisted users), or it could be blackmail/extortion.
The goal for all 3 is to make money (except  in the case of a pissed off user wanting revenge).
Cloudflare helps on all 3.  The first one is obvious since their primary product is Layer 7 HTTP/HTTPS protection.  The second and third are also helped by Cloudflare because ideally your important server backend IPs are no longer publicly visible (unless you use a subdomain which is easily guessable).

CPU mining was done in the days where BTC was worthless (10k BTC pizza anyone?).  They took a risk and they got one hell of a reward.  The same goes for GPU miners.  BTC was not established, it was worthless for the majority of the time, and only in a few brief windows did GPU mining actually become profitable (depending on your electric rates, it hasn't been profitable for me since ~August 2011 outside of a 2 week window during the April 2013 bubble).
The problem now is people expect to be able to invest $X to print $X+$Y dollars by buying an ASIC.  It doesn't work that way because nobody is going to sell you a money printing machine for less than what it's expected to print, unless your money is being used to fund the development of it in the first place (pre-orders).

Yes, Hosting is definitely one of (if not the) largest categories of businesses accepting Bitcoins.
It makes sense.  The Bitcoin community is still dominated by technical people, and many of those people have run, want to run, or still run their own websites.  Not only that, but they're more likely to want a VPS/Dedicated provider over shared hosting due to their understanding of shared system resources and ability to use an SSH session to setup their own systems.
It also helps that Hosting is a virtual service that is instant to deploy and instant to revoke, making it a perfect fit for a payment system like Bitcoin that can't be reversed.  Honestly, I won't be surprised to see many providers go exclusively for Bitcoin due to the widespread payment fraud for hosting services which get used as temporary seedboxes/bandwidth flooding DDoS machines on fake/stolen credit cards.

Yeah, people are always quick to jump to calling "testing" a fancy word for making money off chips someone else paid for.
I won't lie, originally that was part of the incentive.  I thought 100-300 would be enough, and I was selling them at cost (without the 1,000 unit discount, these are sold at cost).  But I also didn't think there'd be much demand, so I might have 40-50 of them running for a few days before they were ordered and needed to get shipped.  Then I got the barrage of emails, PMs, IRC requests, etc.  It very quickly went from a small side project to a major side business for the pool.
In the end, I'm happy with the results.  Once I hit the 1,000 unit discount, it was profitable enough to be worth the time of tinkering with such little devices, and it definitely helps the Bitcoin community.  They're not fast, they're not competitive with other offerings (though you can't actually BUY other offerings without waiting for months), and they may never hit a positive RoI.  However, they are a great step towards decentralization [low barrier to entry + efficient and silent] and keeping hobbyist miners in the game.

You can't identify fractions of a coin that are paid as transaction fees because there is no separation between the fee and the subsidy.  Blocks create a single set of coins created with 1+ outputs, but no inputs.  
Attempting to tie this back to the transactions that paid the fee would result in every single satoshi created in a block that accepted those fees being equally tainted.

This is because most pools use 250KB (default max size) blocks in order to minimize the chances of getting orphans.  Additionally, there are rarely more than ~500 KB of unconfirmed transactions unless we're having one of those rare periods where the network hasn't had a block in over an hour.
BTC Guild uses 500 KB for blocks specifically because it has proven to rapidly clear out any unconfirmed transactions that meet the base (0.0001) fee criteria.  The higher orphan risk of larger blocks tends to be offset by the faster validation of future blocks due to less garbage sitting in the memory pool waiting for confirmations.

Yes, the fee is quite odd.  The declared value BTC Guild puts on international orders for the last few weeks is $30/unit, so a 10-erupter package would only have a declared value of $300.  So a $50 fee is ~16%, very high.  Then again...just ask people in the EU how they feel about the VAT fees!

There will be no increase in coin production as a result of ASICs, outside of a few days of above average block generation prior to a difficulty change.
There's no reason to expect suddenly people are going to dump coins once they start mining on an ASIC.  If they were going to dump mined coins, they're already doing it with their GPU/FPGA mining farms.
I'd actually expect people to NOT sell as many coins after switching to ASIC, since the marginal cost of mining [electricity] will drastically shrink until the entire network has migrated to ASIC based mining.

Stability, fast customer support, long history, modern interface, and earnings you can easily understand/self-audit down to the individual satoshis paid compared to things like DGM and exponential scoring which involve server side variables and payout differences based on the timing of shares which cannot be audited from the end-user side.

They did a slow separation from mining pools when they started solo mining.  BTC Guild was the first and last pool that they had any speed on, but on June 15th they were 100% solo.

There may be a few dumps of coins as a result of early ASIC miners.  You have to remember that most ASIC miners ordered their hardware back in Setpember/October 2012.  They've lost a LOT of money (or at least the opportunity of a lot of money) as a result of bitcoin price rises, and are probably keen to at the very least recover the ASIC cost with fiat currency as quickly as possible.
But this scenario will probably only last a short time, and will have minimal effect on overall price in the long run since even if ASIC miners obtained every coin, they'd only be able to dump 4000-5000 coins a day (until difficulty adjusts).  These days, that really isn't enough to cause heavy downward pressure on the price.

Getwork was a bit more of a bandwidth hog in the old days, especially on fast miners.  With the Stratum protocol, bandwidth was reduced significantly, since it's using a persistent TCP stream and sending condensed messages.
An average Stratum work push is about 1 KB.  Most pools push work every 30 seconds, which means you're at 16 kilobits per minute downstream, roughly 273 BITS per second.
Submitting a share on Stratum is [roughly] 80 bytes of data.  With a variable difficulty pool, you're looking at 12-30 shares per minute depending on the pool.  Using the highest (30 SPM), that translates to 2.4 KB uploaded per minute, roughly 330 BITS per second.
The pool then responds with the status of your share, roughly 50 bytes, which would be 1.5 KB per minute, or 200 BITS per second.
Grand total with Stratum:
Upstream is ~330 bits per second.
Downstream is ~500 bits per second.
These are using above average estimates.  Pool settings, the size of the block being hashes, etc., can make these numbers higher or lower, but generally lower.

The last peak had one significant difference between what is happening now.  At the last peak, Bitcoins were highly centralized in the hands of a few.  The huge bubble/burst dispersed coins to MANY more people.
Additionally, the last bubble had NO support behind it.  The price was going up drastically, but the bid side of the order book was almost non-existant.  In this rise, you can clearly see support forming behind the price increases.  It took a relatively small dump of coins to start the panic selling on the June 2011 crash.  Today, the order book could absorb a 35-40k coin dump in a single market sell order without dropping under $20.

The Bitcoin market has always had its fair share of obvious manipulators, so when looking at charts, its always a good idea to consider motives in addition to general pattern analysis.  The timing along with the size of the initial dumps (and the price points they stopped at) definitely point more towards a manipulation than normal market behavior.
At least that's my opinion, after seeing these same types of events happen with the Bitcoin market over the last 2 years :).

Yes, this will eventually cause another hard fork whenever another block is mined that causes the BDB error to prevent a block from validating in outdated clients.  However, it is a hard fork that must be made eventually.  The bitcoin protocol that people knew about when they started with Bitcoin was that the block limit is 1 MB, the reward halves every ~4 years, the maximum coins are 21 million, etc.
The fact that 0.7 has a bug that can sometimes fail to validate a large block was not intended, and it cannot be expected that we carry an unexpected hard limit like that going forward.  Eventually a hard fork must be made to abandon a bugged version, and as long as there is an upgrade plan with defined warnings and time tables, that is the best we can do to try to make the hard fork as transparent and painless as possible.

Your transactions are likely to take hours/days to confirm [if they ever do] if you do not include the default transaction fees.  Most nodes will not relay your transaction at all when the priority is too low.
A large transfer [10+ BTC] can sometimes get by without a fee when it should have one by default, because of the priority calculation.  Extremely small transfers will likely never have enough priority for a node to forward it without a fee.

It means very little most of the time, but can have a huge effect shortly after a large sell/buy order, where the spread may be 30, 40, even 50 cents apart between buys and sells.  Many users are not traders, and simply base their sell/buy order prices off whatever the last price shows.

p2pool operates on a psuedo-blockchain (sharechain).  The settings of p2pool aim to create 1 share per 10 seconds average.  This means that the faster p2pool gets, the higher the minimum share difficulty becomes.  That increases variance for slower miners.  Eventually it would be virtually unusable for slow miners as a way to reduce variance.
p2pool has some great concepts, but the implementation is not good enough for an average miner to use it as a replacement for pools.  Right now it is because it's very small, but the larger it gets, the less useful it is for the average miner.

I've sold many coins through Coinbase because I would prefer my business account be full of transactions from a US Company instead of overseas wire transfers.
They're normally quite fast, but I have definitely seen them start to fall behind in the last few days.  They may be having to work out issues with their bank to process higher amounts of ACH transfers.
Remember that as Bitcoin price goes up, their ACH transfers go up in both directions.  Additionally during a rally, they're seeing a *huge* spike in activity on both ends.  My guess is their bank(s) are probably wanting to have extra confirmation that these transfers are not in error because the average ACH size probably tripled this week if not more.

Let's not also forget that the date ranges are cherry picked.  If you were to extend the graphs out a month prior, it's not even close.  Two months prior, and there's almost no resemblance.
The leadup to $32 in June of 2011 was a complete bubble.  The price went up roughly 30x in between April and June 8th, most of it in last week ($10-&gt;30 took 7 days), and there was very little volume (in dollars) overall until the last week.  The 2013 rise on the other hand is (so far) barely over a double in price after a full month.

Expanding on this:  Even though you can't say solving a block for a pool would've been one if you solo mined, as of right now they're ~30 BTC ahead of how much they've generated for BTC Guild (2 blocks found, 11 million shares submitted).
So yes, variance can be a bitch, and from a business perspective, guaranteed revenue at a steady pace is often preferred to higher revenue that spikes based on luck.

BTC Guild will be selling ASICMINER USB Block Erupters within one week of this post.  The first 100 units are already en route via DHL and should arrive by Friday.  An additional 250 units are also ordered and will likely arrive by Tuesday of next week.
Pricing is cost [0.99 BTC + 0.01 handling/supplies], and shipping (0.03 for 1-3 units, 0.08 for 4-9, 0.15 for 10+).
If you want to buy a small quantity, or you don't like DHL, all units will be shipped via USPS First Class or Priority Mail with tracking without any minimum order.  Only available in the US.  International buyers are welcome to contact me personally, but shipping costs/times will be higher.
Inventory will continually be added as stock runs low, and the normal lead time between out of stock and in stock should be 5 business days.  You will be able to place an order if it runs out of stock, and your position in shipping will be preserved so you get the first units from the next batch.  Instant refunds will be available on any order currently waiting for a restock.

To get them without simply buying them, mining will still produce coins in the form of Transaction Fees.  A few pools (BTC Guild, Mt. Red, OzCoin, slush, BitMinter, and others I'm sure I haven't listed) already share transaction fees with miners.  By the time the network has mined most of the coins, transaction fees should be much higher per block than what we see today.

My parents have always been fairly technologically illiterate, though my dad over the years has slowly been learning to use his computer in a more proficient manner.
When I started with Bitcoin (March/April 2011), it was an excuse to build my first computer rather than just buy one.  Then I added another.  And another.  I mentioned it very briefly to them over the phone at one point when I was building my mining farm (at the time it reached 5.5 GH/s, which was relatively big for March/April 2011 difficulties, more than 1 block/day solo).
Then I made BTC Guild at the beginning of May.  In June, as the bubble was ramping up, I was out to dinner with my parents and pulled out my phone and mentioned that I had just made enough to pay for dinner since we first arrived.  I think that's when they finally started to take it a little more seriously.  Over the last 2 years, after many times going over it with my father, he finally has a relatively strong grasp of how it works, probably more than most miners do actually.
I don't know how seriously they took it at first, but my parents have always been very supportive of anything I do that I enjoy.  None of us imagined it becoming as big as it is today, especially with such a meager beginning in my dining room.
I did meet some relatives in their late 60s recently for a grandmother's 90th birthday family reunion.  I was able to explain it to some of them, quite well, even though they don't even know enough about computers to tell you what browser they use.  They left knowing *what* Bitcoin is, a bit about the built in scarcity (and that there is no person that can just magically create more when they feel like it), and even a reasonable understanding of how it's created.

A few hours makes almost no difference.  Taking out 250 TH (nearly half of BTC Guild's speed is on a private server that was unaffected) for 12 hours means very little during a 2016 block interval which difficulty is adjusted for.  Additionally, of the 250 TH/s you "take out", a huge portion of it just moves to other pools automatically.

BTC Guild in general mines the largest blocks/most transactions these days.  We use very high settings to make our blocks larger.  Minimum size (if enough transactions in memory pool) is 250 KB, which is the default maximum size that most pools still use.  50 KB is set aside for 0-fee transactions (that have high priority - IE: old coins with many confirms).  Max size is set at 475 KB (500 KB is the absolute limit until May 15th) as well.  This is on all Stratum nodes (so ~20 of the 24 TH/s).  The other servers run default bitcoind settings.

This is why I've always told people in  that they shouldn't pre-order from any of these companies until they prove they have a working product.  It's probably going to hurt my pool in the end (fewer people pre-ordering ASICs), but at least it might save some people from getting burned horribly.
The people who held onto their BTC instead of "pre-ordering" a BFL chip at launch have likely made more profit than any BFL ASIC will ever generate by the time they ship [if ever].  And the ones who didn't put money into bASIC as a result were able to avoid getting screwed.

GHash.io hasn't gotten nearly enough scrutiny.  For BTC Guild, there is a clear profit incentive to not do anything evil, and a history of self regulation when the pool became to big.
  For GHash.io, they lose NOTHING if they misbehave with miner's hash rate.  They're luring in hash rate with a 0% fee plus a massive private farm of their own.  Their private farm is larger than any mining pool with the exception of BTC Guild.

Biggest difference this time:  We've had multiple large selloffs during the vertical climb.  Each one involved the spot price dropping by 30-50%.  It then recovered quickly.
This time we have positive news coming from the US Senate hearings where they were overwhelmingly positive/supportive of Bitcoin rather than the news many expected which was heavier regulation or outright stomping it.
China is now involved, and is putting in as much or more money than the USD/EUR markets.
I am a major pessimist, I've been expecting a pop since $200.  But there is *definitely* a different trend this time.  We've had selloffs that were equivalent to what popped past bubbles and have ended up moving even higher instead of crashing.

I posted this in a few other threads.  Please stop using blockchain.info to declare "BTC Guild dangerously close to 51%".  A 24 hour statistic is too small of a window.  BTC Guild's luck has been FANTASTIC in the last 24 hours, producing 20-30% more blocks than it should at its given hash rate.  You can see this on our PPLNS Stats (compare Closed Shift rates per share to PPS rate).
 provides a chart using the last 2016 blocks (same measurement used by the network to adjust difficulty).  This is a much better time frame because it means you won't have huge spikes/dips related to luck.
Blockchain's 2-day/4-day charts are always completely busted (they don't show even close to 2 or 4 days), so they're not helpful either.

Just FYI:  BTC Guild's primary payment method (PPLNS) is a 3% fee, pays orphans, and pays transaction fees.  This is what ~91% of the pool currently uses.  The other payment method (PPS) is 7.5% due to the gambling aspect it imposes on the pool owner.
PPS used to be the only method/primary method at 5%, but that was many months ago.  The fee was increased on PPS the last time the pool gained too much network share as a way to encourage some users to voluntarily leave rather than arbitrarily kicking users off.

They're making a payment processor that is plug &amp; play with current PayPal IPN systems.  Essentially all you'd have to do is change a few lines of code in your system's current PayPal processing [changing PayPal URLs] to be fully compatible with the service.
The first version will work with systems that use the PayPal checkout/order page when finishing your order.  They're still working on a version that will be compatible with stores using integrated checkout (where the entire process happens on their website and never leaves to PayPal's checkout/login page).

BTC Guild recently updated it's block policies (was actually started just before this post/email was sent to pool operators).
BTC Guild now runs 750 KB blocks, with 100 KB reserved for high-priority/low-fee, and a 150 KB minimum size.  Additionally, OzCoin and Slush have started deploying 500 KB block versions to their Stratum servers.
In the last 24 hours, it has made a considerable impact on the blocks being relayed.  Transactions are confirming much faster, because even pools that still use default settings are being left with fewer unconfirmed transactions to pick from.
I'm also talking with organofcorti on the bitcointalk forums, to discuss setting up a new thread in the Mining Pools section which provides a neutral thread which goes over the publicly stated block size, fee, and discrimination (like SD blocking) policies of each pool so users can make a more informed decision with where they mine.

At current rates, yes, a 500 MH/s miner can use it with "reasonable" (way worse than any decent pool, but not unusable) variance.  But the more people use p2pool, the worse it becomes for slow miners.
As for pools on p2pool, that's just a bad idea.  The rate of longpolls is too high with p2pool as it is, and adding extra latency to that process is going to significantly impact your earnings.

Last sentence says it all, and what I've been saying for a long time.  A zero-sum game like Bitcoin will lead to market consolidation naturally in order to reduce variance.  At a cost of 3% (less when factoring in orphan blocks are paid and tx fees included), users get constant payments to their account, generally multiple times per hour.
The odds of the pool ending a difficulty period more than +/- 5% of expectation is extremely low, which is why users with a lot invested in ASICs have tended to favor BTC Guild.  High uptime, rapid support during attacks, private servers for larger farms, all make the pool extremely attractive to users looking to maximize their return.  A 2-3% fee is a small price to pay when your alternative could leave you with far less due to variance in an exponentially increasing difficulty landscape.

BTC Guild's "Getting Started" page for new users recommends GUIMiner and/or cgminer.
I have thought about removing the GUIMiner link, but I've found a lot of new users are intimidated by the pure command line interface miners, even though cgminer is very "newbie friendly" with its runtime configuration and prompts.
The main reason most old pools show older miners like poclbm/phoenix/diablo is because those clients require command line arguments to be passed into them, whereas GUIMiner/cgminer can be executed and the server, worker, and password all entered where prompted.

Bit late on the reply but here's how it would work coming from an accountant's point of view (this is based on USA):
Mining income is ordinary income (Schedule C for individuals).  You can depreciate your mining equpiment, write off a portion of your electric bill, etc.
In a PERFECT world, you would record the income as the coins were mined, at the value of the coins at that time.  When you do sell, you recognize capital gains/losses of the difference in value.  You would have to pick first-in first-out (FIFO) or last-in first-out (LIFO), and stick to it.
Unfortunately, the world is not perfect, but the IRS realizes this.  While straying too far from the above can get you in trouble, there are some allowances that can be made as long as your reporting is consistent.  If you follow a strict routine and regularly cash out your BTC, reporting the income at the price sold would be acceptable, as long as the cash outs are frequent enough and you aren't holding coins in reserve.  If you start holding coins in savings, you would need a much more sophisicated system to keep track of ordinary income vs capital gains/losses similar to what I mentioned in a perfect world scenario.
For the second question, I think at the moment, the pool market is saturated, but only because it's very easy to start one.  There is always room for another well managed (and well funded) pool, but it's very hard to separate yourself from the crowd of mediocre options.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:16:52
Wrong.  To do an attack, you have to decide to do it BEFORE the lucky streak hits.  And if you lose the gamble, you better hope nobody was watching because the pool just committed suicide if somebody caught the attempt.

I have returned 0.5 BTC to the original address, since BTC Guild did find the block.  Over the years I've returned many accidental TX fees, but unfortunately that isn't quite possible to continue doing in full.  Ever since the change to PPLNS, TX fees are shared with miners, and they are credited instantly (no 120-block delay) since orphans are counted.
The 0.5 BTC represents the approximate 20% of the fees that the pool kept, due to PPS users (7.5~8.5m out of every 40m shares currently) not being included in transaction fee sharing.

This is more related to the price surge than ASICs.  Only ~10% of the current network speed is on ASIC, and the network is still growing as more people are turning on GPUs to mine at $25+/BTC.

More news coming soon I hope.  I'm working on the order process right now.  The goal is that if items are in stock, everything ships within 24 hours.

Everything handled First-in, First-out.

Longest part of the process is that I'm testing every single unit before shipping.  Units are tested for a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 3 hours.  The short run tests are done without any external cooling to guarantee the chips reach their maximum temperature (assuming a 72F ambient).
This means every unit that was shipped to customers should be in full working condition, with no Dead on Arrival units.  Ideally, miners will receive them within a week of shipping (all 5 orders that went out Saturday afternoon were delivered by Tuesday).
My hope is that after the next 1300-1500 ship, I'll be able to build a reasonable inventory so that units are shipped out within 24 hours of being ordered once all backorders are cleared out.

Mined Bitcoins in a perfect world are reported as income on the date you mined them.  That's the *proper* way to record it, even if you didn't sell them.  Then when you sell it down the road, it's a capital gain, or loss.  Preferably after a full year of holding for preferable tax treatment.
If you didn't do that, ordinary income (Schedule C) for all your BTC sales during the year.  Don't even attempt to do capital gains for mined coins unless you kept impeccable records of the date coins were mined and the sales dates so you can prove which sales were long-term and which were short-term.  You will get completely fucked in an audit if your records are inadequate.

ASICMINER is extending a coupon to the most recent (~30%) of orders at 1 BTC, where those users will be able to buy a 2nd erupter at 0.10 BTC.  Since BTC Guild is the one receiving the coupon, these coupons will be distributed to users once the new units arrive (~Aug 5).  The price for coupon orders will be 0.15 BTC (0.10+0.05 Ship/Handling).  Exact details for how they will be distributed will be posted on the news section once the units arrive.

The fee was on the entire transaction, which was a 40 KB size (which is MASSIVE, most transfers are 200-500 bytes), with lots of tiny useless payments.  The transaction fee charged was 0.0001 per KB, ending up at 0.0041 BTC (since it was above 40 KB).  Transaction fees are influenced by transaction size, output size, and age of the coins used to make the transaction.  In this case, the output size (many people paid microcents) being so small enforced a fee, and that fee was multiplied by the 40 KB size.
This transaction paid out to a LOT Of people on top of the payment to you, the fee was only charged once to pay all those people.

There's quite a few pools that include transaction fees these days.
BTC Guild does with PPLNS [and also pays orphan blocks on PPLNS].  slush's pool pays txfees on Stratum.  BitMinter pays them.  OzCoin pays it to DGM miners.  Might be more, I was just working backwards from largest pool to smallest as they came to mind.

Not based on what information is available.  ASICMINER has reported only 12 TH/s potentially coming online (possibly more, but nothing confirmed).  Even if all of that power was pointed at BTC Guild, added to the original userbase, it would be ~16 TH/s.  
However, the network speed prior to ASICMINER joining was ~25 TH/s.  Adding 12 TH/s to the network would put BTC Guild at 43% of the network (~16 of ~37), with ASICMINER making up roughly 33% of the network if they split off to mine solo.

I don't count Mt.Gox as market price because it's impossible to properly pull USD out of them in any kind of reasonable time frame.  Bitstamp, tends to be the 2nd most liquid exchange these days.  Coinbase is generally paying the same or slightly better than Bitstamp.
Since Bitstamp is in the EU, it is generally a better deal on Coinbase because coinbase is a 1% withdrawal fee, whereas Bitstamp has a commission (~0.22% for me), and ~$50 in international wire fees by the time it finally hits my account.

And one that owns roughly 2/3 (maybe more) of that 22.7% privately, meaning they can do this shit and if miners leave they still probably have 16+% of the network.

Blocks marked as BTC Guild on Blockchain are almost guaranteed to have come from BTC Guild.  The pool software tags the coinbase transaction with a "Mined by BTC Guild" tag, and they always pay to the same address.
Blockchain.info uses that to identify BTC Guild's blocks (as far as I know, that's the only thing they use to mark BTC Guild blocks).

It's really unfortunate that Bitcoin lacks a strong face associated with it.  I suppose it makes sense for a currency based on decentralization to not have a single person that is looked at by the entire community as a leading voice.
The developers are who I would name, Gavin, Peter, Jeff, and many others.  And then there are the people at Bit-Pay who seem to be continuing to market Bitcoin to new businesses.  This helps make it so consumers are introduced to Bitcoin with places they already shop at, rather than getting asked to go somewhere they're not familiar with.
Lately I've been starting to take it upon myself to introduce those around me into Bitcoin more.  Even though I'm a pool operator, I've tried to make sure my pitch/discussion focuses more on the monetary aspects.  Too much focus in the past has been on pushing newcomers into mining.

1) scrypt is not ASIC resistant.  It's a marginal increase in cost to make an scrypt ASIC, but there is not enough value in any scrypt coin to justify the NRE, especially when the *proven* cryptocurrency is still obscenely profitable to develop ASICs for if you're going to front that kind of money, either for private farm building or retail.
2) Calling prime number chains useful work is a stretch.
3) So yet another hash algorithm change like scrypt.
4)  No counter-arguments there.  This one is actually a legit change.

cgminer and bfgminer both support long polling and roll-ntime.  poclbm and GUIminer (when using the poclbm kernel) also do.
All 3 also support Stratum, which makes long polling and ntime rolling obsolete (Stratum is the next generation mining protocol, it is better in every single way than the old getwork protocols).
bfgminer is a fork of cgminer, but cgminer has maintained much better Stratum support.  The bfgminer developer has an invested interest in the GBT protocol, which is inferior to Stratum for almost all miners (higher bandwidth, higher stale rates, and requires more CPU usage than Stratum).
cgminer's Stratum support is top notch, and it includes things like GPU overclocking, fan, and voltage control inside the miner.  But even for a novice user, cgminer is very simple.  Start it up, enter the pool address, worker name, password, and you're set.  It requires no variables like -v, -w128, -d0, etc.

The 1,254 coins was an error made by BTC Guild (my pool).  We DID lose about 200-250 coins as a result of the hard fork because BTC Guild pays for orphaned blocks on both payment methods.  Any pool that was on 0.8 and pays for orphans lost money from this.
BTC Guild's stance is the pool takes that hit.  Responsible pool operators will likely all do the same.

Long standing pool, constantly updated/worked on to remain stable.  Support email response generally measured in under 5 minutes unless sent during late hours (midnight - 8 AM PST).
First pool to have proper variable difficulty implementation made it a great place for early ASICs.  Transaction fees shared with 3% PPLNS, and at current pool size the 24h variance is the smallest you can get outside of PPS which about 40% of the pool uses.
It's also not run as a "hobby" or "part time" gig.  BTC Guild is my full time job.  I spend 80+ hours a week available for support or actively working on the pool.  Thanks to recent price increases, that gamble actually paid off.
@_date: 2013-06-12 17:57:52
After a few weeks of implementation, it's finally live on the site.  All PPLNS users are receiving namecoins every time a block is solved.
A lot of care was taken in making sure this implementation wouldn't negatively affect the stability of the pool or the latency/performance of mining nodes.  Everything was done under the goal of "Bitcoin first, Namecoin second", and the software was written in a way that if namecoin hangs, freezes, or crashes entirely, the pool will keep chugging along without issue.

It's simply making the first part of the coinbase a data push for 3 bytes, followed by 3 hex pairs for the block height in Little-Endian format, then moving on with your normal coinbase message/extranonce.  And of course updating the version number in your block.

You can label it that.  So will a dozen others.  For some reason Bitcoin companies always like to state they're the first to do 'X' even if users can list a dozen others that already did it.  My favorite example:  I think we've had 4 exchanges claim to be the first US compliant exchange in the US.  We have even more claiming they "will be" the first compliant one trying to drum up publicity pre-launch.

cgminer is unmatched in terms of features/performance.  While some people have managed to hack together a phoenix/phatk that outperforms it on SOME graphics cards, cgminer is almost unbeatable in most cases.
It also supports native stratum, and is able to bundle all GPUs into a single worker, which reduces the overhead even more.

On a new server for BTC Guild I did a fresh blockchain sync with 0.8.  The first half only took about 5 minutes, but that's because the blockchain was VERY small until ~April 2011.  After that it slows down a lot, but the whole chain was up to date in under an hour.  A massive increase in sync speed compared to what it used to take.

Well, there's more deterrents.
1) Pool suicide even trying
2) A "big enough" score to be "worth" trying would likely do SIGNIFICANT damage to Bitcoin.
3) Good luck getting an exchange to wire MILLIONS of dollars to you before finding out about the double-spend event.
4) Personal safety if you try it.  I'm not exactly a man of mystery when it comes to my real life identity.

For those that frequent the bitcointalk Speculation forum with all their graphs which use cherry picked date ranges, y-axis scales, etc.
Here's a chart with a line drawn between the bottom price of post-bubble 2011, and today's price on a log scale.  It shows roughly equal TIME spent above/below the line.
It means very little [data picked to show a pre-determined conclusion like almost everything in the Speculation threads], but obviously points towards a future of $1m/bitcoin by the end of the year :).

SSL won't prevent a MITM attack, unless you're checking the SSL certificate or have a plugin/extension that does.  If the attacker is faking the server, they can give you an SSL certificate for their own server.  It won't match the "real" bitcointalk.org, but your browser doesn't know the difference by default, since bitcointalk.org is currently pointing to the evil server.
So while your username/password were SSL encrypted, they were decrypted at "Evil Server" and seen in plaintext.  Then forwarded to the real server afterwards, and the response from the real server was then sent SSL encrypted to "Evil Server", decrypted, then re-encrypted with "Evil Servers" SSL certificate and sent back to you.

BTC Guild has (on many occasions) mined 3 blocks within 2 minutes of each other.  That's with only 30-35 TH/s.  The whole network finding 6 in 10 minutes is not that unlikely.

Botnet miners are hitting back too.  BTC Guild has experienced 3 separate DDoS attacks in the last week.  One of those held a server offline for five days straight, even after all DNS was moved away within hours.  Nobody has sent extortion requests, bragged about it, or done anything to indicate the intent behind the attacks.  That indicates it's most likely either A) botnets trying to knock a large pool off to keep difficulty down, or B) another pool trying to make miners leave BTC Guild.
They're going to be hitting back very hard over the next few months to try to keep their business profitable.  But eventually they will lose.  But as posted by Litecoin_Messiah, they're already moving to Litecoin since it was designed as "CPU friendly".  Might as well call it Botcoin this time next year.

I believe instructions for using bfgminer and erupter blades is in the 'README.ASIC'.  Last I heard it required you to compile it yourself, but that may have changed.
Your best bet for support would be in IRC (freenode), either in  or   Luke-Jr, developer of bfgminer, is in both chat rooms most of the day.  I know a few people in  have successfully setup their blades with bfgminer, but do not know if they still lurk about.

An attack like you're describing cannot be done in secret.  Miners can clearly see the hash of the previous block being worked on by BTC Guild.  While very few people do look at it, I'm certain somebody out there is probably watching that on multiple pools.  You would expect it to happen only during an orphan race of 1 block.  It would be EXTREMELY obvious something was happening the second it continued after a single block.

Don't forget to put aside 40-50% of that million to pay IRS and state taxes if you live in a state with them.  Your 1 million will be ~650k, assuming a no-state income tax state, assuming no other income for the year that pushed more of that million into the top bracket.

Transactions can be pending for many blocks depending on transaction volume over the network, and the transaction fees attached.  Blocks are generally limited to ~250 KB worth of transactions.
Additionally, overall network luck with finding blocks sometimes means there's an hour or more between blocks.  During this time, obviously no transactions will get confirmed.  As a side effect, there will be a large backlog of transactions waiting for confirms, adding even more delays if your transactions are small or have no fees attached.

ASICMINER has officially announced it, so I can stop being cryptic and/or trolling :).  They decided to use BTC Guild to stress test/ramp up the production of their ASICs.  You can find their thread here:

Attempting to do that risks higher orphan rates.  BTC Guild pays for orphans.  The selfish miner attack doesn't factor in the fact that withholding your blocks and only announcing if a competing block is found is going to cost you a lot of money in orphan races.  It's a double-whammy if the pool pays for orphaned blocks (lose the coins you would've gained from the block, and still pay them out to miners).

Your story is pretty similar to mine.  I was an accountant (4 years in a CPA's office doing compilation &amp; reviews, year and a half working for the CPA's son who had more than a dozen companies).
I got into BTC in April 2011, and went full blast into it.  In May, I opened BTC Guild.  In that time, I fell in love with finally working in my dream field (IT).  I didn't hate Accounting, but programming and web development had been my passion since middle school.
In late 2011, I started feeling like you.  I simply couldn't stand going to work anymore, it felt pointless.  I was making more money from my Bitcoin venture than I did at the day job, but it didn't feel secure.  The job was a security blanket.  By February 2012, I put in notice at the job that I needed to start spending less time in the office because my own business venture was distracting me from my job.
Now that I've left, I can say quite certainly:  I will probably not return even if BTC Guild or Bitcoin as a whole crash so far down that it isn't sustainable to live on.  The weight off my shoulders from leaving the other job is something I never want to return to.  I still love the company I worked for, and I do miss parts of it, but there is no way I can return to a day job that I don't feel challenged at or feel a sense of accomplishment each day.

BTC Guild does not even have 40%.  Do not use blockchain.info's charts.  The time window they use makes Luck play way too much of a factor.
 gives an accurate look (and properly identifies almost every pool, which blockchain.info does not) over the last 2 weeks.  This is a much better metric for pool % of the network than a 24 hour window.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:20:09
Selfish mining is a theoretical attack that did not factor in the fact that you can't just hold onto your secret blocks without getting completely crushed in orphan races.  If you're withholding blocks until you see someone else push a competing block, you're probably going to lose that race.
Meanwhile, BTC Guild would lose it's ass off if it tried because it pays out on orphaned blocks.  So would any PPS based pool (although these days there aren't any pure-PPS pools left).
