There is a lot of things wrong with your statement. For one it would require AML and KYC to get an address. Which is impossible to control because of its decentralized protocol. Secondly it's a global currency. How would they differentiate between Americans and the rest of the world? Finally taxation is theft and bitcoin's best feature is its ability to do regulatory arbitrage.

But banks, or companies that do bailins profit more in the short term and buy those firms who don't use bailins. That's why since the bank bailout of 2008 we've had a massive consolidation of banks. The bad ones took all the bailout money and bought up the good ones. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:19:04
Thank God they didn't. The exact scenario described above is what happened in Cypress when they did a bailin. Its bad enough that states can do it. Allowing private business is to take customers funds and give them equity without their permission will result in severe moral hazard where companies play loose and fast with customers money without any fear of consequences.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:16:29
"equity token's" if how both bailouts and bailins work. In a bailout, like those in the USA, the government gives a bank money in exchange for equity. In a bailin like that of Cyprus, the bank takes its customer's funds and gives them equity. Both of these situations are not what the customer wanted. Allowing this to happen creates moral hazards. All other exchanges and banks will know they can play fast and loose with other people's money and never face the consequences.

Well if Trump wins we should see a rise in bitcoin seeing as he'll force the money transfers from the US to Mexico into bitcoin. That's a 24 billion dollar market if my memory is correct.

Yep that's basically it. I think people go through a "I'm going to try day trading" with a "that was stupid idea" somewhere after that. The sprinkle in a few "holy crap it's going to the moon! look how much money I've made" followed by some "what was I thinking I've lost so much money"  randomly through those stages.

I sold almost all my gold in 2010 to buy Bitcoin and I haven't regretted it. But it is a tough question. If you look at the best case scenario for both it adds a little clarity. If bitcoin goes to the moon then there is a good chance it's because it is working and people are using it. If gold goes to the moon there is a good chance fiat currency is in such bad shape that people won't want gold because when it gets that high it's not very divisible. Just MHO

With the amount of people who are going to put their coins in the LN the profit margins will be driven very low.

I do think the fact that the protocol and the tokens are both called bitcoin is a bit confusing for new comers. Trying to explain to people that there is a difference between capital "B" Bitcoin and lowercase "b" bitcoin makes a complex explanation even more hard to understand. TrustNet may be a good alternative name for the protocol.
@_date: 2016-03-08 19:56:21
I should have worded that different. I didn't mean demand would grow as in more users. I meant demand in relation to supply. If supply is restricted and the amount of users stays the same then demand for transaction space grows in relation to supply.

I have nothing but good things to say about circle. I use then more then any other exchange. I get paid in bitcoin and use circle to pay my credit card bills. I move at the very least 1,800 through their exchange weekly. I've even hit my limit of 3,000 a week on occasion.
@_date: 2016-03-08 19:50:25
That's contrary to the theory of supply and demand. There is always room for new people no matter the block limit. It just means higher fees making small payments less desirable. With higher fees miners make more money which would attract more miners. This is why people want a limit. Without a limit miners make less causing some to leave and centralizing mining operations.  As long as the fees are lower than other settlement network like ACH and SWIFT bitcoin still has a competitive advantage. Even with high fees Bitcoin has the competitive advantage of a small settlement time. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:49:09
Altcoins may work for smaller payment in the meantime but they are nothing more than out of consensus bitcoin forks. Meta-coins like counterparty and other tokens built on the bitcoin network as well as secure side-chains and off-chain transactions will replace altcoins. In the long run the largest network will win.

Do you have the transaction ID or the address you sent it to? You can use Blockchain.info to see if the transaction went through.

I only hold BTC. I did use my gains years ago to become Debt free.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:58:59
Again it doesn't mean more bitcoins. The amount of bitcoins is a fixed number. I would argue it's more responsible to make the code more efficient while it's small. Segwit will increase efficiency by nearly 50% and the lighting network could remove 90% of the transaction volume from the Blockchain. Scaling a large application of Bitcoin on a house of cards is a recipe for failure. It's far better to ensure we are on solid footing before trying to scale.
@_date: 2016-06-01 18:52:24
I do something very similar to that. When I'm out at the bar or at a restaurant with my friends I offer to pay for their meal if they accept Bitcoin. They pay the whole tab in US Dollars and then I set them up with a mobile Bitcoin wallet and send them the amount of Bitcoin to cover the entire tab. It's usually 30 or $40. I started doing this when Bitcoin was about $200. Over time they saw the amount of money they had, rise and have since started buying their own. I've done this with about 7 friends.

Buy now. It will go to $6,500 in the next 3 months, then pop and drop to $1,300

They would be much better off buying BTC themselves rather than banning it. Not to mention it would probably kick off a Bitcoin buying arms race among all the central banks.

That depends. Can she live a more than comfortable life on the other half if BTC goes to the potato.

Block size doesn't equal more bitcoin.

Based on past performance. After that last halving there was a  23x increase followed by a an 80% fall. This time people are anticipating the halving and buying early. I called the previous stable point of $250 as the bottom just before the increase. And did the math from there so basically I'm pulling it out of my ass because in economics whenever there's numbers involved it's completely made up

I recently revived about $2 in bitcoin to several of my wallets. When I looked on Blockchain.info to see where it came from it turned out to have a message attached. It was an advertisement for a cloud mining company. Idk how they got my public addresses but if they want to pay me to advertise in all for it.

I 100% agree! When you have real amounts of money in bitcoin like myself you hate these price jumps, at least I do. And I hate even more the "it's going to the moon" people. There is nothing more sobering than the morning after a bubble pops.

Just a thought... when your gf says she likes silver she doesn't mean in bullion form. She wants jewelry. But in regards to your circle account, have you contacted them? I regularly buy thousand of dollars worth of BTC from them. My last purchase was for more than $10,000.
@_date: 2016-06-10 12:16:09
It means the possibility of more transaction. If we got rid of the limit completely we would still have only 1MB transactions for a while. Then maybe 1.1 and then 1.2. not to mention miners can limit it themselves.
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:40:13
The entire point of a Blockchain is that there is one immutable ledger achieved through consensus and secured through burning energy. The longest chain of the only legitimate chain. All other chains are out of consensus bitcoin forks. And should be treated no different than orphan blocks. All the miners of alt coins are wasting money and time on orphan chains. The Blockchain, by that I mean the only legitimate one (Bitcoin) is already decentralized. Decentralizing something that is already decentralized is buffoonary.

I keep my bitcoin is several brain wallets and only import the private keys as needed.

So here is what I do. It had worked for getting over 30 people I know to start using bitcoin. When I'm out for drinks with my friends I occasionally mention bitcoin when appropriate. After a while,  maybe let 2 or 3 outings go by,  I make an offer right when the bar tender brings us our tabs. I say "I don't want to be that annoying friend who talks non stop about bitcoin so let me say 1 thing and I'll be done,  if anyone wants to pay for my tab in dollars I'll pay them back plus their tab in bitcoin." I do it after the tab has been brought to us to ensure they don't eat or drink more than they normally would. So for example if my tab is $30 and my friends tab is $30 then they pay the restaurant $60 and I set them up with an easy to use wallet, usually blocktrail or airbitz and send them $60 in BTC. Over the years I have bought over 30 friends either dinner or drinks. Once they see how it works it's easier to understand, plus it cost them nothing. And when it goes up they get excited. If it goes up a lot they usually buy the next dinner lol. The first time I did it our combined tab was about $50 and the price of BTC was just under $50. Needless to say those few people in the beginning are very happy now. They saw a price of a dinner turn into a mortgage payment.
