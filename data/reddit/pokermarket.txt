coins through now with manual check-up
Dear Mr. PM,
I noticed that you have undelivered bitcoin withdrawal of 44 bitcoins. We experienced a technical issue earlier today which caused some transfers to appear successfully send although they might not be.
We have our team manually checking those to make sure that everyone gets their withdrawal processed as soon as possible.
I wanted to personally reach out and apologize for the inconvenience.
Best regards
Nejc Kodrič
Chief executive officer

Withdrawal was made 8:14 PM, email confirmation was sent 8:15. Withdrawal was marked "finished" around 10:00. Now its 11:07 and the funds haven't arrived.

The other thread was about the withdrawal not processing. Now it finished processing, but didn't arrive. Different situation.

Creating new tx including the withdrawals doesn't need a block?!
Or, because no new block was found, new deposits didn't come in, so no new withdrawals could be created?

I wrote support right when I noticed the problem. An hour later I posted here.
IIRC I was the first person posting on here when bitstamp has problems processing withdrawals about a week ago. I'm not fudding, I use bitstamp every day, this is very suspicious, my duty to report.
Did you have a WD go through in the past hours?
