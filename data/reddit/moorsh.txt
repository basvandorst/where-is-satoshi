AMG means performance more than traditional markers of an AMG. I just ordered a 2019 C43 and it's honestly better in almost every way than my W204 C63.

That’s scary, I always split my large transactions in case of an incorrect copy. Unless this person did the same and they were really moving billions.

Give a man a coin and he eats for a day, teach a man to mine and he eats forever.

You mean no, an AMG means a C43 or C63.

Yeah I used to give my Rune2H for it to be duplicated but never received it back.

Don't worry, this is just wave 19 of Elliot wave theory. We'll be going back up in no time.

Why not just cover the BTC spent by buying it all back?

Then another few years after that when people are lining up on bridges from price at $100k again.

This is a game-changing realization. To rent a lambo, all you need is 1 BTC and \~15&amp; gains per day? vs the 100x I'm chasing gambling on shitcoins.
