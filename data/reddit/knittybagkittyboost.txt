Hi, almost a year ago my friend's LBC account "godtooklsd" was put on forced holiday almost immediately after I deposited exactly 2.14 BTC to the account
I opened a support ticket and they requested I send verification documents. Unknowingly I submitted my own personal identification records and they told me I was not the original account owner, and that only the original account owner could request to access to open the account. I thought fair enough
So I told my friend and we sent a support ticket together, LBC said I cannot them on his behalf so my friend opened another ticket on his own behalf.
Right after my friend opened his own ticket, they replied back saying the account is disabled and will not be reactivated. NO REASON NO GROUNDS
They basically stole my Bitcoins and its been a year. That BTC is worth $36k now.
I would like to have this resolved, I have all transaction receipts from Circle/Coinbase where I sent the BTC from, emails from LBC support ticket which I will post here and my friend is more than willing to give identifying proof the account is his (ID with selfie and date, other stupid stuff LBC asks).
I have never once done fraud on that account and all my trades have been positive.
The only conclusion is LBC is stealing my friend's BTC.
I even opened a thread a year ago regarding this on their forum, useless. They are getting away with fraud
This is the account: 
Here are my screenshots from my email LBC support ticket 
I am hoping to have this resolved soon otherwise I would like to open a lawsuit against LBC in the state of FL

Man nobody can have a logical argument today it’s like everyone is thinking on emotion.
Even when you trade crypto someone gets screwed over in the process, don’t look at things from face value so much,
If you were in the same shoes as the banks you would probably do a whole lot more shit than they try to do, you me, a whole lot of people. They pull a lot of shit for sure no doubt. But so would we :)

He's definitely not 200% her height nor close lmao
5 feet 2 inches \* 2  = 10 feet 4 inches
or rather
62 inches x 2 = 124 inches
Proportionally speaking from a visual standpoint she looks like half of his height when in reality 5 feet 2 inches or rather 62 inches makes up  77% of 7 feet 6 inches or 80 inches.
62 inches over 80 inches = 77.5%
In much simpler terms
She stands at 77% of his height but visually I guess from the angle the photo is being taken at, she looks like she stands at barely half of him.
If you flip the numbers 80 inches over 62 inches
He stands about at 129% when she is used as the reference point ,  an additional 29% over her
OP is correct

you’re correcting someone on their math and percentage, might fuck up their view of how percentages work when he had it right all along
and yeah visually it looks like that i agree 
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:47:42
the formula is simple
feet = one ruler 
visualize a ruler
12 inches in every feet
5 feet x 12 inches
and then percentages is literally just picking a reference point and seeing how much different points are in reference to it.
but yeah metric is SOOOOOO much easier

I am sorry but I don't think Bitcoin is going to be the currency that will actually help these people as much as stable coins can. Bitcoin maybe the currency that backs stable coins and such. The Bitcoin market is still too predicated by volatile price movements and even if it has shown to appreciate over time, these people need and are looking for stability more than anything. 
There is nothing anchoring Bitcoin down and that is actually a good thing for the most part
On the other hand, this could be a HUGE market to create apps and UX interactions for making interoperability more user-friendly and intuitive. Taking advantage of technologies that tech companies have been pushing to us in regards to credit/debit cards short of NFC (as there would be security concerns), if implemented correctly, this can be a big practicality and versatility point for crypto. That is the biggest problem with crypto at the moment, all the tech is there but it's lacking the polish it needs for everyday use. 
There may eventually need to be an international body to govern a mutually agreed upon standards for these as one problem I can present to you, so many different companies which offer so many different ways to pay are so fragmented on how to handle these payments, for example BitPay? What's up with the weird payment addresses for BTC? Why not a real BTC address? Then there are some who don't implement Lightning and it's not consistent across the board whether you're going to be waiting 1 min for your transaction to  confirm or 1 hour.  One thing is for sure BTC gives us the transparency to see all of these things in play and I'm sure as crypto is more widely adopted in a practical sense, and not traded for penny stocks fun can people see this
