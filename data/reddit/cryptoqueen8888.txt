Isn't fiat a fraud? Taxes? The government is a ponzi and how they make you even pay for social security and now they're saying if there's not enough people paying, we're not getting any. That's a ponzi. Depending on new investors. He's probably brainwashed and watching too much CNN but salty sounds more like it since he did have btc and he sold.

Crap News Network. And if you go to foreign hotels, a lot of them only have CNN. Pretty obvious how bad they want to spread the crap all over the world. And most people do think it's a scam and a ponzi especially if they didn't buy it and now it's at $17,000+. Just a bunch of haters and that's why they will always be broke. Most people that trash it are broke. If not broke, they hating cause they missed the boat when it was cheap.

There's no tips and tricks to hold. You either hold or sell. If you have a goal on getting something, that's when you cash out. No one can predict what the price will be tomorrow. If you don't hold, where's it going? To a bank account? It depends on who you trust more. The banks/governments or bitcoin which is us, the community?

I have all three. Ledger, Trezor, Keepkey and I prefer the Ledger. I one time had an issue with it and transferred my key to my Trezor until ledger fixed their sync issue. I didn't like the interface of Trezor. Maybe cause I'm used to Ledger and I like how easy it is to access my alt wallets VS Trezor. Keepkey is my least favorite. I don't even use it anymore.

If you know how to do it in a public place and not sell a huge amount, you won't get robbed or mugged. You can meet up at a bank and carry a counterfeit pen on you. It's the same as Craigslist. Not everyone is bad and you just have to be safe :)

It's not just the demand, but fiat is volatile too. The price of fiat will also affect the price. You can NOT do a KYC say in China and Chinese citizens can't do a KYC for USA exchange. It would be nice to be trading btc between exchanges, but you can't unless you're a dual citizenship and is allowed and you have IDs and documents matching your name in both countries. That's why when people ask what's bitcoin price, you can't show them coinbase price cause that's for USA and countries that qualify to buy/sell on that exchange and then you can't buy btc from coinmarketcap. Then tack on whatever fee you charge to buy or sell.

If you're in the USA, bitquick is great. Cash deposits only and banking hours only too. I've done over 10,000$ to date and had no trouble. There's also bitcoin atms. If you go on Google Maps and search bitcoin ATM, it will show you. If you look at the name of ATM say coinsource, you can go to website and see what type of ATM it is buy/sell, both. These methods might be more expensive, but much faster.

Yeah when it's even $5,000 he will regret it. There is still plenty of time for it to grow. 2140 is when it's forecasted to be all mined. Let's see how much it will reach when this happens and who's willing to part with it at what price. It's only a matter of time before it becomes more mainstream. The higher the price goes, the more recognition it will have.

Yes. Why? Because coinbase controls your bitcoins if you leave it in there. It is an exchange. You have no backup words. That means if coinbase shuts down, you will lose your bitcoins. If they have problems with their page? You have to wait for them to resolve so you have access again to your btc. Unlike a true wallet that gives you your backup phrases, you can't transfer your btc to another wallet with just backup phrase. If blockchain was to shut down and forever disappear, you can recover your btc on another wallet as long as it supports same bitcoin implementation protocol (bip) as the next wallet you choose. If you ever hear about why not to send btc from an exchange to invest in an ICO is because coinbase sends the btc from THEIR wallet. Everyone's bitcoins that uses coinbase is in THEIR wallet. I have a coinbase account since last year. There's issues sometimes where I wasn't able to access cause they're doing suspicious maintenance. I have a ledger and lost it and with the phrase, recovered my btc on a trezor and have also transferred btc to a hot wallet. You can't do that with coinbase. Look at what happened to btc-e:
Go to btc-e.com:
Hard lesson learned for those who left their btc in there. Anything mixed with fiat even though compliant, the government can shut them down. Fiat belongs to them. Mt. Gox was another exchange that got shut down. Yes there is a fee. But how hard did you work for that $25 and how much does that mean to you? I don't know. And bitcoin keeps rising, that might turn into who knows how much. Because fiat amount you paid doesn't matter. It's the value of btc. $1.00 at most for transfer fee to have 24$ safe is better than losing $24

Coinmarketcap.com click on tools. It will give you price history. If you select a coin in particular, scroll down and right above the chart you will see historical data all the way to the right side. Click on it and will show you the specific dates. You can also put from month to month by date and year, right above the prices.

It's something to do with mirroring. I had that issue. You have to uncheck or something like that. You can try it again when it lets you. If not, contact support and ask them. They have a r/coinbase here and is how I get answered.

But remember that anything you can do illegally with bitcoin, you can do with fiat.  Does it facilitate it? Yeah. Can they still trace bitcoins back to you? Yes. Look at Robert Ulbrich. When you send bitcoins to someone, the IP still shows unless you know how to use VPNs or TOR to cover it and make it more complicated to track you down. Also using same address to receive bitcoins exposes you. How do you think wanna cry covered their tracks? And further covered it by laundering in Monero. Some of the other cryptocurrencies have what's called a mixer implemented in the protocol. I find them undervalued but since bitcoin came first, it's the mother of them all because without bitcoin protocol, it wouldn't exist. Most altcoins use the same protocol as bitcoin but change a part of the protocol by adding some kind of tech to it and it's what's supposed to separate altcoins from each other. We create the demand for the coin. It's up to us to accept it and make it increase its value. Now when you talk about ethereum IF you ever consider it, that is a whole different protocol. It's smart contracts and NOT the same as blockchain.

Did you know the dollar used to be backed by Gold until Nixon? And if you go to another country to a currency exchange, they will pay you market price for gold bouillon as long as it's .9999 if it's a ponzi, why can I go to any country of choice and use it to buy their currency? I've done it myself. And I didn't have to pay a fee to exchange USD to URU pesos, Thai bhat, AED Durham, Phillipine peso...... Never had a problem so far when I've exchanged for their currency. Paid me market value in their currency. Problem with gold is you still have to declare you have more than 10,000$ when you travel with it. Gold is one of the oldest currencies there is and apparently still acceptable in many countries.......  And what do you think those hackers will do with Monero which is by the way a more private coin? They laundering it, turning it back to btc and cashing out, or someone will buy their monero and cash them out. And why's Putin openly so interested in digital currency now? Why are bankers trying to get in it through Ripple? Why did Bank of America interested in blockchain tech?
And from bank of America themselves:

@_date: 2017-08-15 07:23:47
It depends on where you are and method of payment. I'm in the USA and I use bitquick.co because it's fast and more private and most trustworthy. Bitquick acts as an escrow so its not just some stranger you're trusting.You don't give up your personal information. It is CASH ONLY deposits and only available bank days and hours. I've done more than 5+ transactions and spent more than $10,000 and never had an issue. Only don't buy more than $4,000 in one transaction if you don't want to be asked for photo ID. You can split how much you buy in multiple transactions and still pay for it all at once. That's what I do myself after first incident. Buying with credit cards and your personal bank accounts for me is intrusive as I don't want to share all my personal information. If you feel hesitant like i was at first, you can always try a small transaction. Many people are and I've sold btc locally to others using bitquick at a higher % rate than what I buy it for because I fronted mine and replenish my supply with bitquick. Like I said depends on where you are and how you want to pay, I know people that used Kraken and Xapo say it's good. I don't know anyone who's used anything else personally. You can google bitcoin exchanges and watch youtube videos and see how they work. Hope this helps. We all need to learn to do things. We're never born knowing ☺. If you Google and find an exchange that will work for you, it's always better to ask for "what's your experience using ________ exchange? That way you can get feedback besides of reviews of others online you might find.

And forgot to mention, coinbase is one of the exchanges that comply with government. They are one of the few exchanges to hold a bitlicense:

@_date: 2017-08-14 09:57:09
First you need to specify where you are as there is different options to purchase. You buy however much you want, and you save your coin. Coin goes up, you make money. I recommend a wallet you hold your keys. Not an exchange. Coinbase is an exchange. So is Xapo. It might not sell a bunch of altcoins, but is an exchange as you can buy/exchange btc for fiat and you DON'T hold your keys. If you don't know what keys are, you need to look at more YouTube videos on best wallets and an explanation why so you can understand. The saddest thing I seen personally is a guy lose 48btc because he forgot his password and didn't write down the keys. And keep your keys in a safe place where no one has access to it. You WILL get robbed if someone figures out what it is. Safest place for lots of btc is cold storage. Look it up. Trezor, ledger nano s are best ones out there. These should be use as piggy banks. Hot wallet only put what you need. If you don't know, pick a determined amount. Like I keep .5 btc just in case I need it. Think of it as a credit card with a limit. That's my recommendations ☺
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:27:08
What makes the price go up is the demand. And USD is a small market. Other countries are in it too and some other countries don't trust their banking system. Fiat is also controlled by whales aka banking cartels. Federal Reserve. What value does unlimited printed paper backed by debt has? I believe it will never replace banks because you can only mine 21 million btc. That's it. But if I have a choice to trust my bank or btc, I rather trust btc. You can diversify by buying other assets. And btc has value in the form of if it's worth $0, I still own a piece of tech. While fiat you just own a piece of paper. This tech in blockchain can be used to apply it to businesses. Fiat is worth just as much as bitcoin. We're the ones that will give it value. And while maybe in the USA or certain country gives up on bitcoin, not everyone in the world will. It's like gold. And international currency. You just can't have a physical form of it. And if you hate bitcoin so much, why waste your time in r/bitcoin? Must be curiosity. But if you're against banking cartels and value privacy, you might want to educate yourself more. You will find negativity. You think bitcoin is a ponzi? What makes fiat not a ponzi? If people quit exchanging services for fiat, what would you think happen? But with fiat, the federal banks gets to decide. Not you. Bitcoin is our decision to make it valuable or not. Don't let others make choices for you by following the crowd. We have to think things for ourselves and takes time to make choices for ourselves. With that said, it is your choice to chose how you think. An enslaved mind doesn't think much. It's a subconscious kind of enslavement that some people don't even know is what is happening to them. Most people say they wouldn't follow someone if they'd jump off a cliff. But because someone says something and they read scientific research found by the CNN academy or Fox news, it's automatically qualified as valid information. I wish you well in your journey in life. Good day ☺
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:54:44
This depends on where you're located. As mentioned coinbase is easiest for first timers. Coinbase was my first buy and sell. But I've outgrown coinbase. And as someone mentioned, as soon as you get your btc, move it to an actual wallet that will give you your keys/seed/backup phrase/mnemonic. A hardware wallet is reasonable if you plan on just storing your bitcoins and especially if it's more than .5 a bitcoin. It depends on how you will use your bitcoin. Hardware wallets aren't great if you will need to spend everyday. You can have a trezor or ledger for storage and only load .5 a bitcoin in a hotwallet as funds for everyday spending. By the way hardware wallets are taking weeks if not more to receive. So if you want to buy now BEFORE the price increases on you, any wallet that gives you your keys should work for now. I like greenaddress.it app wallet as I even receive a verification code in my email when sending btc. I have to authorize the transaction and am aware if someone tries to use it. Never had any issues with it. I am in the USA. It's very helpful if you put what country at least you're in when asking these questions. Not everything is fitted for everyone. As far as buying in the USA, I like bitquick because it's cash, you have your bitcoins within an hour, no personal details required to purchase as long as you don't go over $4,000 in one transaction. If you plan on purchasing more, split up the transaction and you can still purchase within same day. Bitquick limits how much you can purchase per day, but you can go around it �� (I've forgot to mention this in my past posts) It's only available during banking days and hours. Don't place a hold unless you're truly buying. They will ban you if you have 3 holds and don't buy. They are an escrow. It's just people selling their btc on it. I've done more than 5 transactions and more than $10,000 worth. I was hesitant at first. You can try it with a small transaction to make you feel more comfortable. I've used it to sell btc locally in person and just charge a higher % than what I bought it for cause people don't trust it. I've fronted my btc and replenished my supply with bitquick. It's tricky, but doable. Now when it comes to selling it off, there's different ways too and will also depend on where you're located. As i stated before, I'm in the USA. You can order a bitpay card (which requires social security number) and withdraw up to 10,000$ a day at any ATM. It is a visa debit card and you can use it anywhere visa is accepted. There's no ridiculous fees to use it. Only fee you will pay is the ATM. Whatever they charge. You can sell locally on localbitcoins, buy gift cards using gyft app (even American airlines gift cards, Amazon, almost any gift card) and requires NO VERIFICATION, you can buy gold bouillon from JMBuillon and sell gold off for market price and get cash that way too, you can go to a local bitcoin atm and buy and sell, but this method is one of the most expensive. You can also Google bitcoin merchants and see who accepts bitcoins. You can even buy travel with destinia. Bitquick you can also sell off. And if you want to have more privacy, I'd suggest mixing it up and use one option here and there. If you chose coinbase, keep in mind it takes 6-7 days for purchasing or loading funds to your account and will do a KYC (Know Your Customer). I suggest pay for bitcoin using debit card/bank wire. If you purchase btc using this, at least it locks in the purchase price for bitcoin. With time and verification, they raise your buy limits. They're also lower fees to buy. They hold a bitlicense and are compliant. Big brother is watching and as any exchange dealing with fiat, can be shut down by government. Fiat belongs to government. They chose how WE use it. So do NOT leave your purchases in THEIR wallet. It's THEIR bitcoins if you leave it there. Hope this helps and welcome back!! ☺
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:39:07
But hardware wallet will take time to receive too and btc price will increase even more the longer you wait. A wallet that will at least give you your keys/mnemonic/backup phrases/seed (all the same thing different lingo with different wallets) will work for now. It's important to recover your btc in case you lose the device it was put on or forget your password and it's also important to save it in exact order it is given to you. Do NOT ignore the instructions. Keep your keys safe also. Put it in a safe if you have one. Only with your own carelessness can you lose your btc. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:38:58
Never consider the price of bitcoin where you can't buy it. Compare exchanges you can buy it from. And also there will always be a % mark up of going rates. And also if you buy with credit cards, you might get charged as cash advance. All parts of the world have their different prices ☺

This..... This is one of the most IMPORTANT things to remember. Those of us that have made it, it is because we hodled! You will see it drop, but it will pick back up. It is it's history. I bought in at $300 and saw it drop. I didn't sell out plus I love the tech. It has more value to me personally because you own a piece of the tech. You own no fiat. Fiat belongs to the government. Bitcoin you OWN!! Fiat can be printed to infinity. Only 21 million bitcoin can be mined. And as long as it's in demand, it will only appreciate more. The whole idea of bitcoin is to eliminate banks. I don't think it will ever happen as there is only a limited amount of btc. But how wonderful is it to be able to transact privately (or as private as possible) and the government not know you bought 99 cent panties at the dollar store? Lmao!! it's about privacy. And the more people really get it, the more mainstream it will become. Most people need to break free from the brainwashing and be open to listen and learn and decide for yourself. Don't let others decide for you. What does money in the bank do? Does it have the gains bitcoin has? No. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:29:11
If you have cash (and only cash) and in the USA, you can buy from bitquick.co I have done 13 transactions with them and once they receive the receipt, I have received my purchased btc within an hour at most. I don't recommend going over $4,000 because they will ask for an ID. Instead break the transactions up. This is if you have a cash option. You can look up YouTube video on how to use bitquick. Hope this helps ☺
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:14:03
Because it's an exchange and anytime an exchange is mixed with fiat and banking, they need to follow laws. If you buy your bitcoins from someone else or if you're in the USA and buy from say bitquick.co or similar, you do NOT give up your identity. Fiat does NOT belong to us. It belongs to the governments. Bitcoin we own. It belongs to us. If you don't buy bitcoin from an exchange and instead transfer bitcoins to buy altcoins, you're not asked for a KYC (know your customer). If you use them as a wallet, they won't ask for KYC. It's NEVER recommended to leave your coins in exchanges. If government feels like it, they can shut them down. Besides the fact you don't own your keys, it's not really your btc. Exchange closes shop, you just lost your btc. On the other hand if you have them in a wallet that requires keys/mnemonic/backup words (Some have different wording, means the same) as long as you get a wallet with same BIP you can recover your bitcoins. If say exchange website has issues with logging in, doing suspicious maintenance, you have NO ACCESS to your btc. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:27:36
You're going to have a hard time buying 10btc all in one transaction. Even after being verified for a year, I can only buy $10,000 a week worth of btc. And the answer you're looking for requires to know where you are located. That's important. There's also localbitcoins which is all around the world, but I would only deal in person at a restaurant or high end hotel with a lounge with cameras and security or a bank. 10 btc to buy all at once is a lot still. You don't want to look like you're buying drugs with all that cash and in public waiting for it to be counted. At least the bank would look like maybe you owe him/her money Lol.But it would still be a lot quicker and more trust worthy.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:45:49
Bitquick.co is another good option. I've done 5+ transactions. Never had a problem and they're more private than coinbase and quicker to issue your bitcoin (within an hour of deposit). Deposit cash no ID required unless you go over 4,000$ and then they will ask for photo ID. To prevent this, you can break up the amount in multiple transactions and pay them all at the same time still. Cash deposits only. It only works during banking days and hours. You have 3 hours to pay for the hold. If you place more than 3 holds with no payment, you can get banned. So don't place hold until the bank is actually open and intend to truly buy it. Good luck with your purchase. If you feel hesitant on bitquick.co buy a small amount first so you can see for yourself. That's what I did because i was hesitant. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:49:20
Know Your Customer. You provide a billing statement, ID, social security# and you wait until they verify that the information you provided matches who you are. Like a bank. Coinbase holds a bitlicense and is compliant with the law.

Make sure you write down and store your recovery words somewhere safe. Blockchain cannot recover your account if you didn't write them down. They don't make you which is strange. You have a choice. But what they don't tell you is that there's no way to recover your account if you forget your password. They will NOT send you no reset password. This is how one guy lost 48 bct in less than 24 hours he just bought it. He forgot the password or possibly mistyped it when he created the account. There's no if and or but. They will NOT help you recover your account. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:11:57
It is something i wouldn't recommend disclosing ever. I know it's exciting, but it's better to NEVER disclose how much you have all jokes aside. Even if you have a throw away account, did you hide your IP address when creating this account? Do you do bitcoin transactions from your IP address? Every time you're on the web, you leave a footprint unless you cover yourself well. And MAC address is almost impossible to hide and MAC addresses is linked to IP. You can become a target somehow for someone.  If you didn't know this, now you do. I hope I helped you understand why. I've researched a lot on network security. It's scary how easy to become a target. I'm not going to put you down, down vote you, call you names or not take the time to at least tell you why this is a bad idea. Instead I chose to explain to you why others don't disclose amounts either. No one is born knowing everything. We can all learn. Just as we learn simple things like walk and talk. I hope you understand ☺

Biggest gainer and mother of all crypto is bitcoins. You can diversify with litecoin since I see it was suggested and one of the most stable coins there is. You can buy it all btc, buy other coins and learn to daytrade and pull your hair out ��. No one can predict anything in crypto. It's volatile and unpredictable. You can start out by watching others. Follow a few of them on Twitter, Facebook, Slack, whatever channels you can find and has the most followers. But if you don't have bitcoin, you should definitely start with bitcoin. You will need it anyways in most cases to buy other coins since bitcoins is much easier to purchase and has the most options. Start small. You can't lose in the LONG RUN with bitcoin. That's what I seen so far and this is my contribution to this thread. Good luck and welcome to the crypto community. Congratulations in making the first step!

Well the last bitcoin to be mined is projected to be in 2140. As long as people keep accepting it as a currency, it will still hold value and maybe even more so because it will be harder to get your hands on. We are the ones that can make it or break it. I believe it will still be around. I believe it will cost more. That's what it's proven to me so far. I've had bitcoin over a year. I bought in at $300 and watched it go up and down and end up in the long run going up and up. Even if in America they were never to adopt it, this is a global currency. Can it ever replace fiat? No because you can only mine 21million. That's not going to replace all currency. Unless other coins get adopted and maybe specific to certain markets, maybe crypto can take over. I don't have a crystal ball. This is just my opinion. I don't think it's really ever going to disappear. I believe it's here to stay. Maybe It's a nerd thing, but even if it was ever to be worth nothing, blockchain is a piece of technology and I own a piece of it. I value the tech. I value that I own something. With fiat you own nothing and your government gets to chose what happens to your fiat. They have control. Not us. With bitcoin it's our choice to embrace it. With that said, you decide for yourself. I look at everything as a whole. Not just crypto, but the corruption in our government, the banking cartels that really control the world. If you watch documentaries, read articles everyday and are aware of what's going on and what bitcoin is trying to do, I think you would embrace it as much as I do. I decided to start speaking out about crypto and helping people around me understand it. But I'm not telling you or trying to convince you of anything. I tell you what I think and share my feelings about it, and you can make a choice. But at least you heard about it vs never hearing about it at all. I wish I knew what it was a long time ago. I first heard of it last year, and bought in as soon as I heard someone out and did my homework. And everyday you learn. You never can know enough.  I'm always open to listening negative and positive sides of everything. I consider all aspects and willing to accept if I'm right or wrong ��

I'm pretty sure they're all broke and brainwashed..... Or the banks trying to bring down their competitor...... nice try!
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:07:36
Yes you can. You still need to do a KYC. At least that's my experience with them. And I did this last year. And I don't use them anymore really so unless they changed anything, it remains the same...... just to check the price is what I use it for since it has the chart on there conveniently and I can do comparisons. Yeah I can use coinmarketcap or Google price, but you can't buy bitcoins from there.

Anytime you mix banks and cryptocurrency, it is no longer private. Banks have to comply with laws and regulations. It is asked of them. I agree with spiritual abyss. If you want to buy btc, it is best to buy from someone like localbitcoins.com in person safely in like a restaurant or a hotel lobby like a Hilton or Marriott (how I would do it and small amounts first) or websites like in the USA bitquick.co which they might have their own version in other countries or bitcoin ATMs as suggested ☺

Congratulations on taking the first step! Welcome to the club and I hope you take the time to educate yourself on it as suggested. Remember that whatever wallet you use, keep your keys/backup words/mnemonic/seeds (All mean the same different wording for different wallets) safe. And if you don't know what it is, you need to start educating yourself more on it. I hate to hear you lost your password and can't recover your btc. You can't recover your btc if you don't write that down if you chose a true wallet to keep your btc in. It is impossible to recover your btc. And if you put your btc in one that doesn't provide this, you don't really own your btc. Cheers!!

I consider it a limited time sale as you never know if you will see it at that price again ��

I've done more than 5 transactions and more than $10,000 on bitquick.co and never had a problem. They don't ask you for ID unless one transaction is over $4,000 and they only ask for photo ID. So I break up the transactions in smaller ones so I don't get asked for ID. What I do is I buy btc from here and sell at a higher rate for a convenience fee cause people like you don't trust anything. I was skeptical at first. But I did small transactions first. There's a tip for you. Bitquick acts as an escrow. So it's better than trusting some stranger on localbitcoin in my opinion. And I've always received my btc in less than an hour. That's just my 2 cents here. If you're just going to not trust anything, you'll never buy bitcoins. Hope you find some btc to buy my friend happy hunting ☺   
One of my transactions:
So unless anything's changed, this is what I know.

Coinbase takes time to raise your limit. I've had my account verified for about a year and have a $10,000 weekly buy limit. If you're in the USA, you can buy from bitquick.co but only cash deposits. It is more private and much faster (coinbase takes 7 days if not more to receive purchased bitcoin) and trusted website. I've done 5+ transactions and if you don't want bank or bitquick to see your photo ID, don't deposit more than $4,000. You can break up the transactions and still purchase all at the same time still. Once you deposit, you send them a picture of the receipt, and you will have your bitcoins in your wallet within an hour. It only works within banking hours so don't place a hold unless you truly intend to buy. You have 3 hours to deposit the money once you place the hold. If you place 3 holds and don't pay, they will ban you. So don't place holds at 3am for example or Sundays if you know the bank is closed. Only positive I see from buying with coinbase is it's one of the lowest % to buy.

I've never done localbitcoin but have traded btc in person with people in person that I know. Works the same way. I know someone that sells on localbitcoins in person. But he sells it. Never had an issue. It's when you use PayPal and banking when you might get scammed. Yes it will be higher. No one I know sells at market price. There's always a percentage fee. Unless they're desperate to sell or bought really low and willing to part at market price. Coinmarket cap doesn't sell bitcoins. You can't count on it to be accurate. Here in America, some people go by coinbase price because you can buy it from coinbase. They will charge coinbase price plus 5% or more. Coinbase takes 7 days to get your btc if not more sometimes (I've done that) and if I'm dedicated exchanger for profit, I need to repurchase my btc I just sold. As volatile as it is, I'm not making any profit if I'm buying high and sell low. The percentage covers some loss if they need to purchase more and price changes higher and I make a profit at the same time. Different parts of the world will be different. Depends on supplier they buy btc. It can be very lucrative to buy and sell if you know how to do it. Also there's bitcoin ATMs  and if you go to them, they also charge a fee for buying and selling.  Also what would be ideal is finding a miner and some can cut you a deal depending on how much you buy. They can lower fee and people on localbitcoins can do the same. Prices are always negotiable.

Actually i did do it with my checking and not my debit card. Notice I bought on the 10th and that email is dated 6 days later...... You can try it. It will say when you will receive it. Never tried wire and didn't know there was an option to wire ��

I can understand your concern. You can always keep an eye on your credit. You can request a free report every year or I have a credit card with capital one that offers free credit check as many times you want and I get alerted when something changes on it. Credit cards aren't a bad thing and as long as you pay them before they're due, you will never owe interest. I had to start off with a secured credit card where I deposit an amount of money and the credit card is for that amount. Then I built my credit that way where now I have $20,000 credit with no annual fees and earn free hotel stays and airlines. There's annual fees for secured cards like 50$ or more but they report to credit bureaus. Just make sure if you go this route to ask for how much annual fees. That's the only thing I use banks for. Good luck ☺

If they understand what this ^^^^ means above. You did a job and they paid you in bitcoin and the price went up. You can go to coinmarketcap.com and click on tools and look at history price charts. If you click on bitcoin it shows specific dates what the bitcoin was worth. You did a job this date, and they paid you in bitcoin. At the time they paid you, it was worth less than what it is now. So you made even more money by accepting this form of payment. It's like me doing a job for gold when it was $500 and the service i provided was $500 at the time and gold price increased in say a week to $1,000 I took the gold to a place where they buy it market price, they paid you market price which increased value and you made more by exchanging your services for gold.

I'm in the USA and this is my own experience. Coinbase takes 6-7 days to load your funds on your account. They warn you before you agree. Now they have an option to straight up buy the bitcoin without having to fund your account using your debit card. That still takes 6-7 days if not more because of "high volume". But at least you lock in the price you bought it for. I have had a coinbase account for over a year and occasionally for emergency have bought. I don't like banks and giving out personal information. I find it intrusive. I now use bitquick to buy. On the positive on buying from coinbase, it's lower fees at times if you can't find a good deal on bitquick. But coinbase is compliant with the law and even holds a bitlicense. Don't worry. You should get your order fulfilled. Next time at least use buy bitcoin option with debit card/bank wire. Hope this helps! ☺

Gold as I mentioned is one of the oldest currencies there is. Because you can mold gold and make things with it, and pure gold doesn't rust, last forever. And it is also not easy to find. It is scarce and takes forever to be made. The harder it is to find something, just like art, it holds more value to someone. Just like a Picasso. Why does a Picasso costs millions? Anything that's collectable? People value certain things especially if it's something not easy to come by. If one day there is one currency to rule them all? Maybe. Maybe we all get chipped and our currency will be time like one movie I saw. Scary thought. Who knows? I have other investments. Not just Btc that I can use to barter besides fiat. Fiat is the least I trust but the most used because hey that's what government said. Let's make this piece of paper currency. In the old days there was no paper. It was precious metals that are hard to find or barter with something the other person needed. We all value something different. If you have maybe some Babe Ruth baseball card I collect and you need say a Painting that I made that was one of a kind, we traded. Say I have some special skill, and you got something I want, we traded off. Then fiat came along that was backed by gold and then Nixon said nope. Dollars need not to be backed by gold no more. Cause someone said. Bitcoin and other assets for now I enjoy owning and know it has value to someone and I can barter with on an international level. Not just fiat to fiat where another countries government can declare useless. I seeked to own assets I can at least barter anywhere in the world. Let's say I lived in Argentina and my currency lost value like this happened:
And I had millions in fiat, what happened? I'd be broke as f I'm not saying this will happen here. But who's to say it can't? I rather be safe than sorry and own things that I can exchange anywhere. Gold is pretty established and will never be worth anything. Maybe to you it won't, but to others it will no matter what some government says. Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies is us the people that have a choice to make it worth something or nothing.
