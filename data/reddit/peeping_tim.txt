this is why they pumped B2X so they could dump useless metadata onto our nodes.

Kinda shit for privacy in that regard. Maybe I don't want them knowing my phone number (which is attached to my identity and country).

Except for the part where we could still increase the block size limit to 4MB and get an effective increase of 16MB with SW.

@_date: 2015-12-27 03:39:10
I just tried this and it works! You type in any number you want for the block size limit and the network is magically able to support any limit you type without collapsing under orphaned blocks! Bandwidth and latency are yesterday's worries!

The point is that they're not even being allowed to charge a measly 1% on withdrawals. The company I'm working for has had the same kind of problem. Our users just want everything to be 100% free. How is that sustainable? Why should we develop the service if nobody will support us?

I think your skepticism is slightly overboard, but you have a very good point. It's trivial for Arthur to take a picture of himself holding his ID. Still, I'm currently convinced.

Seems like they're evolving. Do you remember the one posted to recently about how the girl's boyfriend was ruining their lives with his bitcoin obsession? Or how about the one in I think, where the guy blamed bitcoin for his insane gambling addiction? I think at least some of these narratives are carefully crafted fabrications. It sucks if this guy's story is true, but we should be very skeptical without evidence. Not even a public address, police report or insurance form... nothing. Just a lot of irrelevant details.

what would happen if change tip ran away with everybody's bits? I guess it would just be a couple thousand dollars if that. seems paranoid to think they would destroy there business for that. you are right, its a good asset and we should just not keep our savings in there, obviously.
@_date: 2014-07-22 20:57:21
I'm guessing they spent them on Silk Road, or sold them on exchanges to cash out, or lost them trading. A good question to add in addition to the 'lost/stolen' questions would be, "How much bitcoin have you lost or had stolen?"
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:43:00
Wow, this story sure is rubbing you guys the wrong way. Kind of scary how hostile you're all being about it, as if tipping is the only thing your currency is good for, and now it's being taken away from you.

That must mean that Bitcoin is more than just a get-rich-quick scheme for you. I bet you're expecting to be involved with Bitcoin for several years, instead of just jumping ship as soon as things get a little dicey. We need more people like you, who understand that what we're building doesn't happen overnight.

That's the joke. they're mocking bitcoin and saying we think bitcoin is the solution for everything when sometimes you just need a screwdriver. Ironic part is that their examples, 'fees' and 'unbanked' are DEFINITELY nails.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:56:15
I'm not qualified to answer that. I think we will find applications for different levels of speed versus security. For example, transactions from desktops online could use a slower, more secure, anonymous chain, while mobile wallets could use faster coins for small purchases.
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:03:18
That's pretty pathetic when you think about it. I am amazed that some people are actually 'anti-bitcoin'. I can see being indifferent due to lack of knowledge, but to outright reject it out of ignorance is a whole other level. And then to actually troll one of the few subreddits that *doesn't* reject it... like I said: pathetic. That entire subreddit seems to be only a sliver above SRS gutter filth, if that.

Yeah, I think your expectations are all messed up. You're acting like it's 1989 and wondering where all the websites are. It's going to take more time, like years more.
No offense, but you don't really sound cut out for this. If I were you, I would probably buy a single coin, send it to an offline paper wallet, store it somewhere safe, and forget about bitcoin for the next 5 years. Leave the actual building and using of the infrastructure to people who are most passionate about it or there will just be too many cooks in the kitchen.
Lastly, bitcoin on Apple phones is simple now. There are about 5 different wallets available right now on the app store. I have several on my phone right now and they all have pros and cons, but I have my favorite. There are several threads about iOS wallets that I bet you can find. breadwallet, Bitwallet, and Pheeva are the ones I rememember right now.

When I was your age, I was a huge Apple fanboy. This was like 10 years before the iPhone, and years before the very first iMac and iPod too. I was exposed to both Windows and Mac, and I could see that the Mac would be very successful in due time, even though everybody around me thought they were dumb and on the verge of bankruptcy. 
I could have started buying shares back then, little by little. They were really dirt cheap because Apple was still so small. I never did though, and Apple continued to grow and release very popular products. 20 years later, I wish I would have listened to my intuition instead of my friends, because I would be pretty wealthy by now. Those same friends probably all have iPhones now.

Please don't take this the wrong way, but are you old enough to remember life without the internet? Do you remember how technical and geeky and fringe it was at first? You're basically looking at the internet in 1990 and saying 'this will never work'. I'm sure you're aware that online banking didn't happen overnight. Those systems took over a decade to implement.
Again, the benefits of this new system aren't 100% clear yet. All we know for sure is that, if successful, it's going to be disruptive in ways similar to the internet. It's going to take time to build layers of functionality with end users in mind, but I'm confident we'll get there. Be patient.

One of the criticisms about Bitcoin is that transaction times are too slow. Side chains could fix that, making Bitcoin a lot more attractive for people who are interested in digital currency, but feel that altcoins are a waste of time. 
How many submissions to r/Technology have been "CERN continues searches for Higgs-Boson" or " Mars Rover will enter Martian orbit next week."? It's pretty dismissive of you to ignore progression simply because it hasn't reached its conclusion yet. Judging by your comment, you haven't read much of anything about side chains though.
Take a look at the soft "glow in the dark roads" story. By your logic, who cares about a single highway in Europe. Let people know when ALL the roads glow in the dark. Do you see what I'm getting at?

I just don't know how I would continue living if change tip stole my $0.62. I would be financially ruined! You don't strike me as being very intelligent if you trust blockchain.info considerably more than change tip. Yes, you have the private key to your blockchain wallet, but we all know it would take only a trivial change to their site's javascript to compromise wallets, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's been done already for some accounts that are mysteriously emptied. All web wallets are for spending. If you only deposit what you plan to spend, then you won't have a problem. If we all hoard our bitcoins and tips, then we will have a problem. Sounds like you're just stingy and paranoid.

I've seen this behavior before. Basically, we're not allowed to be anything outside of their stereotypes of us. If they think only men use bitcoin and they see a woman using bitcoin, their delusion is threatened and they lash out to protect it. I don't know if you guys support gun rights, but the same exact thing happened with [Colion Noir]( when he became an NRA spokesmen for gun rights. The anti-rights crowd flung every racist epithet at him, calling him a 'house nigger' for doing the bidding of 'stupid white men', which is their stereotype for all gun owners, especially NRA members. It was really shameful to watch, but such are the minds of the deluded. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 22:14:49
I keep hearing you say that nothing is happening, nothing is changing. All due respect, that's crazy. Bitcoin is the most dynamic, fastest pace sector we've seen in the past twenty years. I just ask that you examine your expectations. What did you actually expect bitcoin to achieve in this timeframe? 
You've been here six months. Give it another six. Like the others said, this isn't going to happen overnight. It's not like the internet was suddenly as awesome as it is today when AOL went public. Honestly, it sounds like what you're waiting for is going to take several years.

I believe AML kicks in at $10,000, not $20. 
There's a legitimate security concern, but it's mostly a privacy concern. This database that Robocoin is attempting to build WILL be compromised and abused.
There is no reason for anyone to turn over biometric information for a simple currency exchange. The government isn't forcing Robocoin to collect this information, or else every ATM and currency exchange on the planet would require the same. I'll ask you your same question: If the government already knows who I am, issued my ID and has my picture, why the hell do they need my handprint too? I don't care what they can *do* with it... they have lost my trust and the less personal information they have about us, the better.
Let's not just blindly support Robocoin because they claim to be disseminating Bitcoin to the masses. Tying biometric identity markers to Bitcoin is a very bad idea.
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:19:17
I answered this in your other comment.
The simple fact of the matter is, the NSA has proven entirely untrustworthy with any of the data they acquire. I don't care how 'foolproof' the scanner is, or if it can't be scanned from a distance.
I understand you are eager to defend Robocoin's decision to implement an unnecessary biometric tracking database to tie bitcoin transactions to a unique individual, but I doubt a community as privacy-oriented as Bitcoin will be swayed so easily.

You said the internet was replacing nothing and that it was completely new. I pointed out all the things it was/is replacing. 
But you make an interesting point to your own disfavor. The internet is a backbone which allows for all these application layers to be built on top of it. The same is true for bitcoin. Remember how skeptical people were about the internet's potential to displace newspapers? Back in the early 90s, people weren't really anticipating that in 10 years we'd be streaming radio and HD video online, or playing MMPORPGs, The point is that we're not 100% sure in what ways bitcoin will be disruptive because those application layers haven't been built onto the network yet. 


This question comes up very often. The short answer is, both systems currently have pros and cons, just like there are pros and cons between the internet and newspapers. If you're seriously asking, I'll try to dig up a recent thread for you.

Don't you think that learning about something and understanding how it works is important for building a well informed view on the topic? I think somebody who has learned about and experimented with a technology has more credibility than a person who hasn't. 
Do you ask for advice about your car troubles from people who know nothing about cars? Do you distrust people who have learned and experimented with how cars work, and what cars are capable of?

The internet was replacing letters, faxes, radio, television, newspapers, magazines, and even departments stores. For the most part, the internet isn't anything 'new', but it's important because its decentralized nature that does all those things mentioned faster and for lower cost. 
Bitcoin is attempting to do the same thing: decentralizing traditionally centralized entities in a way that empowers its users. Just because the analogy is favorable to bitcoin doesn't mean there aren't many parallels between bitcoin and the early internet.

actually, the story received an immediate negative reaction on the newsweek site itself. within 1 hour there were hundreds of negative comments saying it was unethical and in bad taste, and should be removed. then it spread to Twitter apparently, where who knows how many people flamed newsweek even though they don't even know what bitcoin is. if anyone is delusional, its these people who keep claimign bitcoiners are hateful. you sound like you might know something about that chemical imbalance you mentioned.

nobody is forcing or coercing you to use change tip. its growing in popularity and that is really great for bitcoin because many people will have a hard time getting any coins to try out first. i'm waiting for them to finish the facebook plugin so I can tip all my friends there. I think its stupid to say the company has questionalbe ethics. this isn't mtgox. they are very active in the community and have been vary transparent. i don't see any shadyness unless i try really hard to be paranoid. when we called them out over TOS and privacy stuff, they fixed them. I wasn't going to tip you, but if i had, you could certainly send it to whoever you want. it's not like there is some kind of restriction. but hey, there's always dogetipbot, but they are not even close to transparent.

"Cash" would like to have a word with you. Cash transactions and exchanges are conducted on a daily basis without biometrics, or even photographs, ID, facial scan, at least in my experience. You're definitely lying when you say that it's required by law to track all transactions to an identity.
You continue to defend this overreach by asking, "What's the harm?". My question to you is, what's to gain? Literally *nothing* is gained by implementing this sort of dystopian garbage.
I've already made it very clear that I won't be using these machines under any circumstances, and will discourage others from using them as well. What you have yet to clarify is why you're so ardently defending *unnecessary and overbearing* data mining of an unknown and untrusted startup company.

Stupid. It wasn't worth nearly $19 million when the government seized it, and it wasn't all drug money either. And even if it had been, this was a government auction.

Leah feels gutted. She played a hunch and underestimated the devastating impact it would have to her career if she turned out to be wrong. it turned out the reaction to her 'scoop of the century' was overwhelmingly negative so far. it's hard not to have *some* degree of sympathy to watch a persons career implode in the national spotlight like that.
for what it's worth Max Kaiser, the guy who is supposedly one of the top 100 Bitcoin holders at several hundred thousand, has been defending Leah's amazing journalistic ability, and has attacked the bitcoin community's reaction to her story as being motivated by sexism. He mentioned he will pass around the collection plate for Leah. I imagine she will need it since she will probably be unemployed soon. and god only knows what 4chan is doing to her as revenge.
All of this was perfectly avoidable by following traditional journalism standards. I think she and her editors should be sued into the ground.

You can definitely transact with gold/silver. It worked pretty well for centuries. You can still buy Junk Silver, which is just old U.S. coinage from back when it was still 90% silver. A single silver dime (ten cents) is worth about $1.60 right now.

That is poor logic and contradicts your other comment. Bitcoin has never been something that 'everyone is talking about', so it is not possible that 'everyone got bored of it'. They are not talking about blockchain tech because they haven't heard of it or understand it. You are full of shit.

You are deluding yourself. At least 60% of the mining network has voted for BIP100 which is a vote against BIP101. The vast majority of the tech community is against it. Even if a couple centralized brokers like Circle and Coinbase go along with BIP101, they have no control over the miners whatsoever.
Edit: good luck to Gavin when he tries to lobby miners. China is still pissed at him for lying about BIP101 just like you're doing now.
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:28:17
Not voting means it's possible that they'll still vote for BIP101, but voting for BIP100 makes it clear that they will not vote for BIP101, which is effectively a vote against BIP101.

Look at the block versions yourself. Over 60% have rejected BIP101 in favor of BIP100. You can blame some minor DDOSing but even Slush is only about 7% of the hashrate. Miners have **rejected** BIP101. The coup was a **failure**.

Blocks aren't taking any longer to find and they're nowhere near full. They're about 500kb on average. If your business plan fails when you pay $0.025 per transaction instead of $0.01, then maybe you need to reexamine your business plan. Increase your fee by a penny or two and stop bitching.
