thats very nice of you! the problem is, I already claimed the gift card on amazon.com. So I believe that I cannot move the funds anywhere
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:29:39
ok, found it
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:44:40
maybe not a big surprise if you think about that
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:02:11
alright, so the problem is that you do not have the receiving adresses, right? but this is different with the wallet.dat, right? 100 receiving adresses in advance is what I thought. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:44:43
they should also not do backups of the wallet.dat? there is an interface for export but not for import - what sense does this make?

even for someone who gets his entire knowledge from newspapers, it is unlikely that you have never heard of bitcoin at this moment. even in the small town where I was born they had it in the very thin printed newspaper. My mother and my father have seperately heard about bitcoin without me doing anything and without them reading anything in the internet. But maybe this is different here in Germany.

I just searched for it. Couldnt find. just saw the usual payment methods. so how do I pay with bitcoin at this moment?

I know. The debug console does not exist for unskilled users. It hopefully doesnt exist because as soon as they find it, it's becomming one hell of a user experience for them.

this is just how it looks to me
on the other hand they seem to think that escpecially securing your wallet is important since it is the very first point here 
but suprisingly they dont even tell you how to do it, so people have to google it after all.

I'm losing money by the ton today, many millions.
Betting against the yuan.
Isn't the yuan asleep?
Currency markets never close.
And Shanghai runs all day and night now.

well, the other clients indeed seem to have nice features. but still bitcoin-qt encourages exporting your wallet.dat but not importing.
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:52:05
what do you mean?
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:11:02
please also make this work on the german amazon.de
I did not know that there is a difference between amazon.com and amazon.de until two weeks ago. so I used gyft and now I have 150$ stuck in the wrong amazon...
@_date: 2013-09-18 10:41:18
it worked for me - just received the refund

am I the only one who is able to use the blockchain wallet on a non-jailbreaked iphone?
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:31:50
well done design! 
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:04:07
First half is quite good
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:05:24
