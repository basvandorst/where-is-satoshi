Again &amp; again the same fallacy that just doesn't want to go away:
1.   There is NO fiat in the system except for the coinage.
2. Central bank DOES NOT print money for the economy (economy meaning everyone except private banks &amp; treasury, so all physical, legal entities including all public state owned companies)
$ is just unit of measure, like kilogram or second. There exist 2 different substances which are measured with that same unit. Central bank money does not circulate in economy (cash can be safely neglected), and cannot create inflation. It is money only for private banks and treasury. What constitutes money for us non-banks is a an accounting entry on the liability side of a balance sheet of private bank called 'deposit'. It is created at the moment of loan issuance. When creating a fresh deposit by act of  giving credit , private bank is only constrained by its own business policy and estimate of the debtor's credit worthiness and in NO way needs either client deposits OR central bank reserves.
Your money is private, it has nothing to do with state.

QE is not (just)  "introduction of new  money in money supply...", that is what CBs do everyday as their regular responsibility. They  emit reserves to private banks as necessary. But imagine that as a highly sealed nuclear  reactor. CB has immense power to create money (currency) from nothing, but it cannot buy what it wants with it (well not until the invention of QE). That specie of money they create (reserve - it has the same unit of measure like cash or bank deposit usd/eur/chf etc... , but it's different supstance ) can be used only for transfers between banks. QE means that the "reactor" has spilled all over the place and now they are actually buying​ all sorts of financial assets with it. And telling you that's actually good for you. The evilness of that scheme is really beyond comprehension..

As currently defined it demands eternal exponential growth, or otherwise, money gets destroyed and economic activity stops in a deflationary** spiral. And eternal exponential growth is impossible by the 2nd law of thermodynamics. But you can hardly find an economist that knows what is the 1st derivative of e^x, good luck in finding one who sees that his accounting fairy tale is constrained by the laws of physics.
**There are 2 types of deflation, this confusion is highly exploited by persuaders with bad intentions: one in gold/bitcoin standard caused by growth where everyone benefits, and one caused by credit crunch where society starves because there is suddenly less money in circulation.

'Money' created by central banks doesn't have anything to do with you. It doesn't have purchasing power. It's a different supstance with the same measuring unit ($) like the money that has purchasing power. And that miney is private bankmoney created at the moment of loan disbursal. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE NEXUS OF WESTERN CIVILISATION TODAY.  Private banks are not intermediaries, they are money creators. Your idea , which is inline with current hype among people who don't understand how money is created , the so called 'state crypto' will absolutely never happen.

No. That's just the official neoclassical lie:
'USD' is not money. It's just unit of measure like kilogram or meter. There are 2 very different substances in the system measured by the same unit: deposit money (private money created by private bank @ loan issuance - this is our money, only this!) and reserves (which is money only for private banks not the rest of the economy and created by central bank).
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:59:56
No. Private banks create money at the moment of loan issuance, they're not coinstrained by reserves when issuing a loan. When a loan is distributed a fresh new never before existed deposit is born. There is no fiat in the system except for the coinage.  Central bank's money, if not in form of cash ( which is either way neglectable in quantity in any modern economy) does not have purchasing power and is just a bookkeeping entry used for private banks  to balance their trading.

One golden comment coming from zerohedge on Krugman:
[…The article… ] takes a decent stab at trying to describe how big of a worthless faggot that Krugman is. But trying to get the full measure of Krugman’s epic faggotry — to fully plumb its depths, or compass its length and breadth — has turned into the journalistic challenge of our times. Just as the english language is limited in describing frozen precipitation, but the eskimos have 57 words for “snow”, we desperately need a new language, with a suitably rich and varied vocabulary of terms to concept of “faggotry”, in order to even begin to grasp the truly brobdignagian proportions of the faggotry that Krugman embodies. In every aspect of his being, Krugman reflects the archetype of The Eternal Faggot with the clarity of perfection of the most perfectly polished and silvered mirror. One day, doctoral dissertations will compete to do justice to this level of Utter Faggotry. One day, a hero will rise, and we shall truly know the Faggot That Is Krugman.

@_date: 2018-04-06 18:18:48
True it doesn't, but let's assume so. Nevertheless, central bank's money (reserve) is not your money. It doesn't have purchasing power and it circulates only among banks. Your money is an accounting entry on the liability side of a private bank's balance sheet that was brought into existence by loan issuance either to you directly or someone else and then circulated to you by spending. At the moment of that loan issuance, private bank was in no way restrained by state or by its amount of reserves held on central bank's book.
EDIT: The main point of that sticker is this: the most favourite lie of every *private* banker, is to persuade you how "central banks create money" which should inject into you the calming notion that the state is somehow involved in money creation through a central bank, which is not.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:00:20
"Out of nothing" is not the issue. The issue is:
1. There is a cartel. Try to acquire a banking licence and tell me how it went for you. If you succeed then after that try to apply for swift.
2. Private banks (those that matter, who's pipes we use to transfer money) are not subject to bunkruptcy as it turns out.

"How much money they create is regulated by central banks.  "
THIS IS A CRUCIAL LIE that your school injected in you. The Sun is not revolving around the Earth, but otherwise. Central bank is just a clearing house. Amount of distributed loans depend on and only on private bank's estimate of client's credit worthiness and nothing else. Excluding the QE, the latest invention for deconstructing society, central bank's "money" although having the same measuring unit ($) is in no contact with economy. It has no purchasing power. It acts as money only for private banks. Our money (excluding coinage the only residuum of Fiat) is only the money that private banks create at the moment of loan distribution.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:04:38
And I am not. Money as debt , made possible as a consequence  of double entry bookkeeping is a true great discovery of European civilisation. But unfortunately it has bugs. Because the problem of debt based money  is still not completely  solved. These are: absence of definition of non-repayable (non-performing) loan, entry barrier of becoming a bank and above all justice system that is not powerful enough to impose bankruptcy on big banks. 
True capitalism would mean easily obtainable banking licence and free market should then weed out actors that gamble too much or make bad loan decisions by means of bankruptcy. If we had had many many more smaller banks in 2008, we could have escaped bailouts. Reason why bad actors were saved were payments. Most of  the transactions on the planet have to go (at one rooting point) through only six banks.

EDIT: It is imposed indirectly. The state enforces international accounting standards (made by private antity). Bankmoney is a side effect of those standards. Not even them define bankmoney explicitly!
By bankmoney I mean : accounting entry on the liability side of a balance sheet of a private entity with banking licence, which therefore has the right to have "deposits" which are created at the moment of loan distribution.

Your easy access to credit is not a path to happiness. It's just an evil ideology you got infested with in corrupted academia. It just leads to ghost cities, wars and food with 0 nutritional value. The aftermath of it is not worth the society's growth. It's about what happens after the party.

Fuck YES. I've been waiting for their stand. Glad to not have to move the funds to some other wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:20:15
Correct. But, your note is not money, only theirs. Yours can be only if you acquire banking licence.  
The system would be fair if: 
1. everyone could easily acquire one, 
2. in case of issuing bad loans, suffer bankruptcy.
Those conditions are not fullfiled in real life. That is why our system is actually NOT capitalism.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:11:22
That's true. But it doesn't make the system right either. And 'teenage idiots' here are not complaining on 'out of nothing' phrase either.

No it is not stupid. Learn more on subject. It's not easy to swallow this pill. Your money is a debt instrument created  solely by private banks at the moment of loan distribution. It has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with state.

Absolutely wrong! This is a typical misunderstanding. Read &amp; watch prof Steeve Keen for example. "Interest" is not money! Money is stock ($), interest is flow ($/year). These are different entities like for example coordinate (m) and velocity (m/s).  Interest is the velocity of money. All loans in the world (of the not same Tenor) can be repaid with a single dollar coin if this coin would circulate with enough speed. When someone usually says the word "interest" actually means "income gained from interest" which is stock (money). You repay interest out of already existing money. 
EDIT: this is the interest that a debtor has to repay to the creditor. Now, the bank is the creditor and once the bank profits, i.e. gets its "income gained from debtor repaying interest", the bank shares part of it with you giving you the "interest" (more precisely: gain coming from debtors repaying interest) and crediting your account.

If you are plebs living outside paradise, i.e. non-US and non-EU, the answer is no, there isn't. Check out cex.io. They have a service to withdraw btc "to your debit card". This is supposed to work worldwide.  It is actually a wire transfer, but with a twist. These type of international wire transfers, legal abroad - to -physical domestic entity would be stopped and banned by banks, but in this case, the bank sees this transaction as coming from visa, with some additional metadata in the tx about the origination which has a well-hidden cause. The downside is that if you are from a country that has a financial sector from a stone age (most of the world shitholes, including mine) there is a high probability that the bank's core system will not be able to process this type of transaction ("withdraw directly to debit card").  So, make sure to first try and make a test transaction with a small amount. 
Needless to say, KYC on cex.io is mandatory prior to performing any.

'Prdi' (serbo-croation) is 3rd person singular present tense of: to fart, which translates to: fartiction. Addiction to constantly pull something from your ass, maybe?
