You're offering people free internet money that they don't know much about, so they're suspicious of your intentions.  What do you have to gain from this?
And then when it turns out they have to do some work to get the $5 worth of BTC, there's a minor annoyance factor.  If you're going to give me something free, why do I have to setup a wallet thingy/signup for it?
Add onto all that arguing with the teacher.  We've all been in classes where students address the class and/or argue with the teacher.  Sometimes it can be enlightening, but 99% of the time you as a fellow student just want to get the class over and done with and get out of there... and this guy is slowing things down.  
My father went back to school as an older gentleman and constantly gets in discussions with the teacher.  His classmates HATE him.  There's a time and a place for everything.  Don't be that annoying student.

I'm afraid I got a strong vibe of  from your post, OP.

Someone comes up to you and says, "If you sign up for this website you can get $5."
That's essentially what the other students are hearing.

He doesn't look guilty so much as he looks incredibly, mind-bogglingly incompetent.  Maybe it's an act.  I have no idea.  But when I look at him I see the very picture of incompetence.
