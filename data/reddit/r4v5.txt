Luckily, some companies don't care. I'll give my employer right of first refusal if anything I develop seems remotely relevant to them, but it's still mine.

Yes, and "will receive a free subscription to the service" implies that others will not receive a free subscription to the service -- that they will, in fact, charge for it if you were not impacted by the clusterfuck.
Which wouldn't surprise me, after so many other signs of MtGox having their heads so far up their own asses they become Klein bottles.

Which app would that be? There's a ton of seemingly-related shit that pops up when you search "bitcoin", but if I've learned one thing about the android marketplace it's "always use something other people are using".

From where, if I may ask?
