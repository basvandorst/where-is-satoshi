I know you're bored being off all summer and not old enough to drive anywhere. Maybe your parents can take you to the pool ?

why dont we rent rackspace in Mauritius or wherever that tax-haven island is that all the rich people have their scam accounts in ? Where the government hasn't "cracked down" on at all. Then we can all have "off shore tax havens" just like the 1%.

Never said "patents are never sat on", so you should work on refuting the central argument. My aunt is a proctologist and she says your story resembles a crock of shit.

you never established that any books "didn't get written". you cannot prove a negative. cite some source containing evidence that books were halted.

you're using the same "water-powered car" argument: people have made water-powered cars, but the patents always get bought out by GM, to protect Big Oil. People have  made cold fusion reactors in their garage, but the power companies sue them out of existence. yeah sure bruh. whatever

It's *easily stoppable* if you control &gt; 50% of the mining power. We spend how many hundreds of billions/year on "defense" ? you could take over bitcoin for less than the cost of a single B-2 Bomber.
All they'd have to do is make the case for it, and say "whelp, this bitcoin shit is literally terrorism, time to fight a 'war' on it, to protect freedom! But you know what, blockchain is a *great idea*, just use it with one of our Approved Partners at JPMorgan, BofA, or Wells Fargo"

can you give me one example of a person who "tried to start his own currency but had the FBI knock down his door" ?
