This was OB's Response: 
Thank you for using OpenBazaar and sharing this report. So that we can work on addressing scams within the software, can we ask how you discovered this store?
OpenBazaar is a free, open source network for trading goods and services directly and privately between people - using Bitcoin - without anyone else being able to control, interfere with, or even see those transactions. It is designed this way to let people buy and sell on the internet in a way that protects their privacy, is secure, and prevents anyone else from controlling what they do.
This also includes us. The development team can (and will) fix bugs in the software itself but without direct access to the machine on which a user runs the software, no one else is able to access or alter any other individual user’s profile, store, information or transactions.
OpenBazaar is provided as-is to be used at the discretion of each user, though we are aware that not everyone will always operate in the best interest of their fellow humans. We are working hard to add tools to make it easier to identify who is likely to be a trustworthy user on the network and we have also taken some actions to help minimize the impact of actions like these.
Regarding your report, here are the actions we have taken:
- OB1 has de-indexed the store you reported so the store and products are not searchable.
- OB1 is working on ways to help users more easily identify trustworthy moderators within OpenBazaar.
- Our Reddit &amp; Slack communities have been warned about this user.
Here are some actions that you may also take:
- Continue to try to contact the seller and moderator in any way you can find as they are the only ones who will be able to resolve your issue.
- If you have not already, please join the OpenBazaar community on Reddit ( and on Slack (Please complete this form to receive an invitation:  in order to help us share and aggregate information about bad actors on the network.

Since we have no confirmation of who created bitcoin, it is possible that the system was invented by the central banks as a one-world-currency. I have nothing to back it up one way or the other, really.

Good. CO2 levels are lower than they've ever been and more CO2 makes plants grow big and strong. Carbon dioxide levels in the mainstream are a complete lie. We now have 400 ppm CO2 down from 7000 in the middle ages. Agenda 21 seeks to get that down to 150 ppm which will cause plants to suffocate. The media lies about our climate conditions just as much as it does about BTC being 'dead'.

Never stop. Just sell what little you need when you need it and treat your wallet like your new bank account. Also, don't be tempted to leverage trade everything like I when I lost it all. Now I have to be a wage slave again. RIP.

You know how the media lies about bitcoin being 'dead' all the time with so-called 'experts'? They lie about other things as well. Just my two Satoshis.

They also raped and murdered children for ritual purpose to the Baphomet! Just like bankers today! Some things never change.

You sell it. [Paxful.com]( or find a Bitcoin ATM somewhere.
