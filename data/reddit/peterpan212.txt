I can't believe I forgot to put this in the post but since BTC is not an official currency their are little to no regulatory restrictions around BTC gaming - this makes it accessible to anyone at anytime from any device
It consumers ones entire being

Let's try and refrain from any bashing, I don't want to dilute the message 
Nobody is to blame, blame solves absolutely nothing - each counterparty knows what they sign up for however, I would hope we put humanity in front of profits
Just shocked nobody has really spoken about the magnitude and severity of destruction that can occur with gambling accessible 24/7, 365 days a week with no regulation
Sure - as a gambling addict I used to love it - now I have my wits back a bit I can understand the need for regulation in gaming

Most likely a stale stat - was from a Forbes article 2 years ago - not sure the ownership blend now that real institutional buyers have come to the table
The most dangerous about it all to me was having it available at all hours from any part of the world
I would literally be in meetings with investors while playing 3 hands of blackjack @ 5 BTC a pop

I always liked to play but the accessibility wasn't easy despite living a few hours from Atlantic City - I didn't trust a single online fiat casino that catered to people from the US - I haven't stopped completely, it still has it moments but I am able to garner more joy from betting less and learning to get thrills from lower stakes

First off, I think you are simply being a brat and not looking at the post for why it is
Secondly, I spent years in therapy understanding the gamblers high, ask any medical doctor in psychology and I am 10000% on the dot - and of course I would be speaking only to myself, I don't know a single person here
You took defense to BTC when yes - it would have been other things but btc has made it accessible at all times
Nobody is to blame, just trying to help those through my experience and would appreciate it if you would not she anyone who wants to speak who does have an issue

it's the most brutal emotional rollercoaster of my life and I have been on some doozies - thankfully I was able to start loosening it's grip once I forgave myself for the past and things I had no control over - I was able to get back my sense of self respect and having a supportive and loving partner has made such a difference
