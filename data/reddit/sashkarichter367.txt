Saw this deal but not sure should I get it... need to do more research. Nonetheless, I have been wanting a big touch screen hw wallet for a while now. &lt;3

"If Vegeta has a cold wallet"  ��

This review is not bad and not too far off from my experience of the wallet at the moment. One thing I wish to complain about is though: the coin support is not enough compared to Ledger or Trezor. They support a good number of coins but some of them are very niche wish I suppose you don't need. Updating is a bit tough and the magnet charger is easy to become loose.

That makes sense, sorry I didn't know what you meant by just cold storage.

What cold storage?

This is creating a private key and keeping the recovery seeds, right?

The printer issue really bothers me, I'll be looking into it more.

I'm thinking of getting Trezor because it has a good reputation but I heard setting up can take some time.

I don't trust every hardware wallet

Yea! that's what I thought, I need to get it off Coinbase!

Not many people knows how to install a cold wallet system and deactivate or remove all of the network components. Using a hardwarewallet also means faster transactions. This should depend on how one likes to manage. Many people I know who use hardware wallets keeps more than just BTC and sometimes trade using the wallet. Anyway I don't think they are useless. It's better to have them than having newbies lose their btc in stupid ways. 
There will always be people who thinks their piece of paper is hidden well in plain sight and found out it got thrown away the next time they need it. We need more options for every level of people.
