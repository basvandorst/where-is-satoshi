Aluminum will rot in seawater or in anoxic/caustic environs, is very soft generally (say a building falls on it in a fire or something rubbing out the stamps), will melt at relatively low temperature (1200 F), etc. And alum will oxidize in air, if shallowly, but in an anoxic or acidic environ can be easily eaten away. 
The problem is that basically all rocks are alumino-silicate compounds, which means much of the world's micro-flaura are completely used to munching aluminum, even micro-organisms, and I'm not sure I would trust it to last for more than a few decades depending. Maybe if you encased it in something.
That's why I listed the two more exotic elements which do well in acid, in seawater, are hard, can't rust, won't be eaten by microorganisms, etc.

Incredible, I'm stoked.
I hope the Yours team will take a look at this concept for implementing competitive decentralized moderation to avoid the trap that Reddit has gotten itself into where people who own 'keyword'-friendly subs are impossible to get rid of.
 Competitive moderation would allow users of a sub to choose the moderator that THEY see the sub through, as a lens, while not affecting what others see, basically allowing multiple versions of a sub to exist and for users to choose which moderator team they prefer:

The "wouldn't warlords take over" question has been addressed many times by many people:
The truth is that in such a system, there is no avenue for someone to take over. The whole of society will reject the notion of 'takeover' at all, because they will be used to being free, and not subject to the arbitrary decisions of another human being.
Free will become a culture, and those acculturated to freedom will view the sort of pseudo-freedom that those who live under state rule now as a completely joke and a lie.
They will easily see that if someone tries to force anything on them that this person is a budding tyrant and deserves to be resisted fiercely, just as people do when an outsider tries to attack the sovereignty of a country.
The trick of course is getting to that place where the first generation has been raised in a condition of freedom, but I am not worried about warlords or tyrants taking over Bioshock-style, because there is no word phrase that can force people to do what you tell them.
Bioshock was, by that means, showing how tyrannical law is, whereby one person can force another to do what they want just because they have political power.

Friedman examines it in his book, "Machinery of Freedom."


Not necessarily. Firstly, you're conflating the two of them as one entity. This structure is inadvisable. Police services would be one company, court services another.
Secondly, it's likely police services would be a salary position, not a per-arrest position, with their agency hired by the community at large. So, no conflict of interest there, actually the opposite, since getting paid by the community they police would finally restore police incentive to treat their customers well, which has become sorely lacking into day's government police which have no accountability to the people they patrol and basically oppress.
As for court services, they too could be setup under an insurance / salary model, but might get paid by the trial too, but since they have no ability to create trials, like you're insinuating, there's no conflict in that, especially as they would likely be getting paid the same fee by each side splitting the fee.
Anyway, Friedman examines court incentives in "Machinery..." and they compare far better than current incentives on monopoly state-sponsored courts.
Don't confuse your imagined scenario with being the only way to arrange things.

Don't hire the same company to do them; stipulate in your contract with them that they cannot merge, etc. In a free market society, the kinds of solution you're looking for are all done by contract rather than by law, sometimes creative contracting.


I just got through saying that neither body need be paid on a case-by-case basis, if that's what it comes down to.
Courts are likely to roam or be accessed by many groups and people and uses. 


You could try that. It would be stipulated in the founding [COLA contract]( of the city. I doubt I would use that system though.

The best thing would be for Core to raise the blocksize limit before we force their hand.
They will likely do this so that core retains its importance and relevance. If we route around core, core will be permanently deprecated and everyone associated with it will have to jump ship to whomever the community rallies around for the new fork.
The core devs will also want to retain some control over future blocksize increases, even if they have to cede now to a larger blocksize. This is another reason they will merge a larger blocksize into core before we all route around them.
Thank god that the power to decide is in the hands of miners and not the core devs, else this impasse would've never even come to a head.
If core merges a larger blocksize now, it just puts off the fight into the future, as we should not expect them to change their minds. Once 2mb begin hitting the limit, they will regurgitate the fee-market BS and try to block larger blocksizes.
But if the Core folks do not cede to a larger blocksize now, then the community will bypasse them and others will tend the new fork, others more amenable to future increases.

There is, but not trying to do what bitcoin is trying to do, but trying to do other things. Bitcoin has the currency aspect locked up. But notice that bitcoin and colored coins aren't really competing. Anything that has an alternate niche to be anything except "payment system and value store" will likely do well as a side-chain integrated into bitcoin. Like Darkcoin or w/e could make a decent run at privacy protection.
But these alt-uses aren't going to see price increases as drastically as bitcoin, because bitcoin has become the center of gravity. Displacing that would be a monumental effort. And the problem is, anything another cryptocurrency can do, bitcoin can do. Same reason why supplanting the dollar once it became a world reserve currency became virtually impossible. Things that are in the same category have the same attributes and it's very hard to compete on the same basis, but easy to compete on alternate basises.
Thus cryptocurrency can supplant fiat currencies easy enough, because cryptocurrencies can do things that non-digital currency can't do, in the same way that television can do things newspapers can't do, even though both serve news and stories.
Specifically, cryptocurrencies can send and receive value digitally--you can't send a physical dollar over the net. Similarly you don't have to trust anyone person or entity to send and receive and hold bitcoin, but with fiat you do. So there's significantly more existential risk holding fiat over bitcoin.

Space has a giant power source 24/7--the sun.


Solar panels will not, sure, but solar concentrators will.
What you can do is build a mile-diameter mylar reflector and unfurl it with a tiny amount of spin and it will unfold and stay unfolded, without any support structure, just the small spin giving it centripetal acceleration to keep it unfolded and stable. This can have a parabolic shape that will concentrate gigantic amounts of light at its focal point, where you can place a very efficient and powerful heat-engine for power.
Not going to be cheap to build these, but we are able to do it now if need be. Unfortunately the first one will require lifting almost everything in orbit, very expensive.
After the first one we can use its output to melt down asteroids into component materials and build with that.


Maybe that would be a better choice than solar upfront, but TPTB look down on a nuclear solution due to crash potential / rocket explosion on liftoff, in which case it becomes a dirty bomb effectively.

Again, you aren't understanding the difference between investing and gambling.
In gambling, the odds of you winning are against you.
In investing, the odds of gaining a return are in your favor.
Just risking money doesn't tell you whether you are investing or gambling automatically.
Otherwise, the entire Wall St complex would be a giant gambling racket, not a giant investing racket.
You expect to lose money when gambling. You expect a return when investing.
Bitcoin has a long history of going up in value and a lot of reasons to expect this to continue.
Buying bitcoin is investing, not gambling. The true risk is unknown, but seems to be much lower than you assume.

That's not inflation, that coin has already been issued. It's just not available for anyone to buy.
Also, it assumes that Satoshi is an idiot, since it would devalue his coins significantly.
His best play is to wait for bitcoin to go mainstream then buy things with bitcoin directly, and cash out sparingly over time so as not to crash the price of bitcoin.
We can be reasonably sure that he's not going to simply dump a million btc on the market, and each year that goes by where this doesn't happen is another point of confidence that that won't happen.
At this point, I won't be surprised if we never see those coins move. Nor will I be surprised if we see them move for the first time perhaps 20 years from now.

This ultimately is how bitcoin is supposed to decide on things, the major miners get together and decide what is in their interest. It is clear that larger block are in their interest. Miners should expect to get paid more from larger numbers of transactions, not by some fee market that's being shoe-horned into the vision of bitcoin by those who want to satisfy the demands of governments to control bitcoin in this or that way. No thank you.
I'm quite sure that this is what is behind the 1mb crowd, they want to create a human-layer on top of bitcoin that governments could then pressure in any way they want. They think this will allow governments to accept bitcoin, but actually it will allow governments to neuter bitcoin.
Bitcoin was supposed to be beyond the reach of governments, 1mb and the LN/Blockstream, etc., these are human organizations. If bitcoin comes to be dependent on human organizations for its core function, then bitcoin is once again subject to regulation by the state, and the state will giddily take advantage of that.
Even replace-by-fee seems designed to address the concerns of state regulators that bitcoin transactions cannot be recalled under any circumstances.

This is not necessarily so, because of the effect of comparative advantage.
As an example, let's say you have a lawyer and he hires a secretary to type for him. But let's say that the lawyer is a much faster typist than the secretary he hires. Will he still hire the secretary? Yes, he will, because even though he has an advantage when it comes to typing, if his time isn't taken up in typing he can do the even more valuable work of lawyering, so the worst typist frees him up to focus on work he can do that the secretary cannot do, which is far more valuable to him than typing work.
Thus, even when a 1st world country is far better and more efficient at say making linen shirts, it will pay the 1st world country to let a less efficient 3rd world country do that and shift resources into software production, something the third world may not be able to do at all, but which is far more productive and remunerative than linen production.

Nah, look into the last accidental fork created by that updated several months ago. It can be taken as a simulation of what would happen in a 51% attack.
The attacker controls the block-chain and the response of the bitcoin devs would be to fork the blockchain and cut out all the 51% attack transactions created by the attacker, just like the compatibility problem created an alternate blockchain. In practice this would mean rolling back the blockchain prior to discovery of the attack. 
Within hours, or less, of the attack being discovered, the bitcoin foundation devs, or equivalent, would make a statement and roll out an updated client, complete with blacklists in place against the 51% attacker and hashes of his blockchain would be checked against and ignored, and the blockchain would continue along without the attacker's fork being taken into account.
Anyone who didn't update their client would continue along the attacker's blockchain, but since the vast majority of people have an interest in maintaining an honest blockchain, the attacker would very quickly find his chain ignored and thus irrelevant. He'd be unable to spend from the chain, as spends would show up as invalid.
I get this from reading, iirc, Jeff Garzik's take on what they would do in response to an actual a 51% attack over the years. I suggest starting with him.
According to him, and iirc the context was the challenge of how they'd respond to an NSA sponsored mega hasher taking over the chain, was that they'd employ the above methods, and that it would be stupid on the NSA's part since they'd have spent many millions and months of effort to achieve an attack that could be easily foiled with a few lines of code, a few hours of testing, and less than thousands of dollars.
In a contest so unequal, the 51% attacker can't win.

What an incredibly foolish statement.
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:36:33
A private rights enforcement agency lacks the moral legitimacy of a government. So, in a private law scenario, how do they become a monopoly in the first place?
In economics we know that monopolies can only arise though collusion with government. Monopolies are always government privileges.
Therefore we don't expect a rights enforcement agency to become a monopoly in a political scenario that precludes the monopolization of law production, such as polycentric COLA law.
And if this were a fear in the first place, it would be easily prevented by segmenting the rights enforcement. Don't have just one agency doing everything in the first place. Have individual specialists companies, each able to be held as a check against the others, each incapable of eclipsing the others therefore, because you're not willing to pay them to do so.
The idea that one could monopolize large regions also assumes that there is a economy of scale in rights enforcement, which is by no means a necessary assumption. Even now we segregate them by city and town, not by state or nation. It's likely in a free market scenario that there would exist competitive pressures in rights enforcement, from one COLA to the next.
And if this is so, then if one enforcement agency became belligerent you hire another one or two to deal with the first. But it's quite likely they wouldn't do so in the first place, since that would mean becoming a criminal organization. An oppressed person is always willing to pay more to end their own oppression than an oppressor is to attack them.
Still not convinced? Then read Friedman's "Machinery of Freedom" where at book length he explains how a polycentric system might work, and why monopolization is unlikely (it's available as a free PDF on his site, btw).

Recently I was at my local Thai place waiting to pick up takeout and the table nearest the door raised the issue of bitcoin. I smiled and listened in like a creep :P 
They weren't knowledgeable about it, and one of the first things the guy said was, "Who actually uses bitcoin, anyway?"
I raised my hand and they spotted me and laughed--I'd broken the unwritten rule that non-table people are supposed to pretend to ignore conversations going on around them. 
Nonetheless they began peppering me with questions with an air of awe and mystery surrounding it, not one of skepticism.
I showed them the bitcoin app on my phone and the miniscule amount of coin I keep on there and it was a good time :) I told them why bitcoin had a non-zero value (ie: because it's the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions).
That's one of a handful of times that's happened.

It is the technique of genius, and responsible for much innovation in the world. It is the precursor to the 'aha' moment that rather than striking suddenly is actually product of years-long focus on a problem that suddenly results in a breakthrough solution.
And when done right, by the time you're done with the project it's funny to discover that most people won't even think of the challenges that you yourself considered the hardest.
When I think of how the original bitcoin spec included a marketplace and secure messaging--he was trying to extend it as far as possible.

There's nothing inherent about a drug transaction involving force, unlike your previous examples.

That there is violence in the production and distribution of drugs currently is due to their being forced into black markets by prohibition.

They could do that, but it would likely be a good deal riskier. It would take years to get off the ground, constitute a major investment in hardware, and anyone doing it has the adoption problem.
Let's say Saudi did it and start investing in ASICs, two years later they roll out a meagre system that's too concentrated in their hands, and thus not easily trusted by others, with programmers no one else really trusts, likely a closed-source system, and bitcoin is already leaps ahead of it on infrastructure.
After all that, they can't profit from it personally, because that is the death knell of an alt-coin (pre-mining).
And if they change bitcoin's protocol in ways that aren't good, like the stupid idea of an inflationary coin or coins that lose value, etc., then again it's down the drain.
Path dependence and the network effect make bitcoin the most likely choice. And with bitcoin you know you aren't supporting any one country or making anyone particularly rich by using it.
It's doable, but it's both unnecessary and duplicative with no assurance that you can get others to accept it as an independent currency.
Bitcoin is already global today, and not controlled by any one nation or entity. It is a neutral, international currency, with hundreds of millions of dollar invested in infrastructure already.

Force is what a government uses to grant monopolies. So all you're saying is they became themselves a government.


And if the same situation is replicated across all nearby cities, what prevents you from bringing in 16 different rights agencies from nearby to oppose the abusive one?
Or are you actually assuming there could be only 4 in the entire world.


    that there is a economy of scale in rights enforcement, which is by no 
    means a necessary assumption.








Because they are small *now*. Merely the size of towns or cities. How many towns are there in the US alone. Beyond that, there exist more private security guards in the US than public-paid police.
















Right, so the police forces are probably already far larger than they would be in a free market society.


Yes, but its mandate is not the same. It cannot do what police do.








    you hire another one or two to deal with the first. But it's quite likely they 
    wouldn't do so in the first place, since that would mean becoming a criminal
     organization. An oppressed person is always willing to pay more to end their 
    own oppression than an oppressor is to attack them.








But again, how could agency 1 be the largest over all the world. And what prevents the people themselves from forming agency 5 with six times as many guns as agency 1--didn't we see exactly this happen in Mexico recently with the cartels? Where ordinary citizens got sick of them and organized militias and took them head on and won? Yeah, we did.

Money laundering is not a crime at all. The act of money laundering is simply giving money to A. There is no coercion involved. Only if you think society has a right to tax all money could you construe it as harming the country, and I consider taxation unethical, as governmental theft and extortion.
As for insider trading, it should not be a crime either. See Walter Block's "Defending the Undefendable" for his explanation on how insider trading actually improves the market.








Mainly those negative consequences arise BECAUSE drugs are currently illegal. Eg: if heroin were not illegal it would be extremely cheap, which would mean you wouldn't have heroin-addicts committing crimes to gain money for hits. In fact, some people who can legally prescribe heroin, ie: doctors, have become heroin addicts and are able to function normally in society, and keep their jobs as doctors too. It's the illegality of it that ruins people's lives and turns them into wretches on the street.


If you want to minimize stealing you should end the black market for drugs which causes a lot of people to steal to pay black market prices for drugs. Heroin is actually one of the cheapest drugs to produce. In 1900 you could walk into any corner drug store in London and get five hits of heroin for a few pence. It grows on a plant for gods sake.


Yes, illegal trafficking too would be eliminated by decriminalization.








Correct, there should not be.

Sure thing. So when the central bank inflates it creates new money at the pre-inflation value. It then spends this money, or gives it to those who spend it.
These people, the first to spend the new dollars, also the rich, are enriched at the cost of the entire society. As those new dollars get spent over and over and trickle down into wider society, the inflation begins to be felt and everyone's money is worth less.
The people left holding the bag are the poor, who receive the money last and at the maximum inflation point.
Thus, inflation is a means to greater social inequality, that enriches the rich at the expense of the poor, and devalues the already meager savings and earnings of the poor, thus harming social mobility.

19th century experienced decades of deflation, where workers took wage cuts as cost of living adjustments. An aggregate century figure might not capture this effect.
As for 1970 - 2000, that 97% figure represents a lot of money stolen from ordinary people and instead spent by the gov.

The theft is physically invisible. An average person without an understanding of economics may not realize that the $500 they keep under their pillow is steadily losing value.

Banks might use bitcoin to replace ACH transfers between themselves for clearing purposes, as a medium-term use of bitcoin on the business back-end.
They could also enable a currency-blind business-to-business transfer system, allowing companies to select cash or bitcoin, irrespective of what they're being paid in from another party.

So your solution is to abandon the dollar and... go back to metals as the basis?
This works fine as long as the metal-value of the coin is equal to or HIGHER than the legal face value, but if you try to make a $100 coin out of copper and zinc, you face the same problem, so I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

There's an inherent penalty in using any fiat, *inflation*.
While most countries, the US at least, try to hit a 2% inflation target, this is actually hiding the true amount of inflation, because if the money supply were static then each year's additional wealth produced would result in a slight amount of deflation, probably to the tune of 3-4% or so.
So most countries are not merely inflating by 2%, they're inflating enough to eat up all that natural deflation and then inflate even more on top of it, to the tune of about 5-7% or so.
This penalty of holding fiat, and bitcoin's historically deflationary nature, will drive people into bitcoin regardless.
If you're in Caracas today and you have a choice of bitcoin or bolivars, you're sure as hell going to take bitcoin.
This isn't a chicken and the egg, this is an inevitability, because all fiat currencies are managed to the benefit of the entity controlling the currency, fiat currencies are inherently thereby exploitative.
Bitcoin is controlled by no central agency and is not exploitative.
In short, [Thier's law]( holds.
All we have to do is wait. Politicians are constantly driving their citizens into the arms of an uncontrolled currency like bitcoin. The US dollar used to be the currency of relative refuge for people in the world going through troubled currency crises and the like. Bitcoin will take over that role.
If an when the US dollar itself enters crisis, where will people go? Quite possibly to bitcoin, especially if bitcoin gets another 10 years of stability before the dollar goes into crisis. That should be enough for most people to consider reasonably stable and established, and for its use to spread.
If you don't think it will happen, that's fine; don't hold bitcoin.
But if it does, and you can't say it's impossible, then the world will have changed. Just as monarchy was abandoned, we can abandon fiat.

Yeah, you can buy these diamonds now, except that they too are based on the market price. Just they can't get mainstream distribution due to the cartels.
But actually there *is another use* for large diamonds, a quite interesting use actually, an amazing use--transistors.
It turns out that diamond maks an excellent substrate for electronics, in terms of replacing silicon. Obviously the problem is the ability to make large single-crystal boules and wafers of diamond.
But there is a company that perfected the process and has been growing a large diamond boule since 2003. I dunno what's happened to them but they should be at a significant wafer size by now. This would be the largest perfect diamond in the world by far.
The reason diamond makes an excellent substrate is because of its heat-conduction properties which surpass just about every material known to man. Diamond is one of the best heat conductor we know of, if not the best. The result is you can push circuits much harder since the heat leeches out instantly.
There are companies with gallium-nitride on diamond patents out there already.

That's perfectly fine. If we consider deflation to be value-based as considered by holders of the asset, then the supply and demand curve takes lost coins into account and simply increases the value of all other coins, resulting in price deflation. I'm not sure what you're saying "try again" about, this too is a known effect.

There's no man in that middle. There is a machine that makes distributed decisions and thus cannot cheat you.










Which are beyond difficulty to perform and can be easily protected against in high-value transactions that typically take more time anyway to close.
















Except that people are unlikely to accept their scrip for bitcoin.
















Actually this is one of the best things about bitcoin. It flips the usual fraud equation from the buyer to the seller. The reason this is great is because a seller is far easier to find than a buyer on the market. Most sellers need to build up a public reputation, an image, to have a public front, the principals must be known, and they usually have a known location, etc. Thus there's a lot of disincentive on a seller to defraud people, since it harms their reputation for future sales.
A customer can defraud you and disappear forever. They're not relying on a reputation for reliability for future purchases.
Thus, if you have a problem with a seller, they're not likely to bug out and disappear. They'll try to make things right with you, even go to court, because your piece of business is probably far smaller than the value of their reputation.
If you only knew how many small businesses had been destroyed by being defrauded and facing huge chargebacks, you'd know what a massive step forward this is.

Polycentric law begins when a person accepts the polycentric meta-law as an organizational principle, a Nomic political game so to speak. It is the rule that governs how laws are created, accepted, premises like property law, rights, etc.
From there, let's say you X have a house. When L wants to visit, you have him sign an entry agreement that is the 'law' for your house, including what remedies are used for violation of the entry agreement. One of these is 'no shoes in the house' let's say.
L comes in, signs the agreement, and proceeds to stomp around your house with shoes. You demand he leave. L refuses.
You call the police, a private security company whom you have on retainer.
They show up and inform L that he signed an agreement saying no shoes on in the house and he's been asked to leave private property and must now leave, and if he does not leave they will remove him by force, and they remind him that the agreement he signed indemnifies them against lawsuit for enforcing this provision reasonably and with minimal force.
He either decides to leave at this point, or they take him by the hand and physically force him to leave.
You then sue L for damages to your house--let's say you had silk rugs and he tromped mud all over them and this is why you had that law. And in your agreement you had a standard provision saying that damages will be paid for by the damager, etc.
So you sue L now in a free market court. The court reviews the law, the signature, and evidence of damage, like any court would, and rules in your favor, giving you a judgement for $3500 to fix the carpet.
L doesn't want to pay. So you sell your claim to a car repossession company for 80% of its value and be done with it. 
They now own $3500 worth of L's assets, and they specialize in recovering assets via car sales. They could repossess any of his assets, but they specialize in cars.
They contact L and tell him that he can sell something willingly to repay their claim on his assets, or they will take it by force and sell something, then return to him cash anything above their legitimate claim. He tells them no, he's not paying.
So they come and they steal his car in the night. This they can do, because they are a part owner of L's assets by your court judgement.
They strip his car that night and sell it off for parts to the tune of $10,000 dollars, much in excess of the needed amount. L should've paid them, he could've chosen what to sell in that case had he done it on his own, but since he did not go willingly they simply took property that was easy to snatch and would definitely cover the judgment.
They take their $3500 and send L a check for the rest.
When L finds out and gets the check he's furious, understandably--although foolishly. He sues them in another free market court, a different one.
This new court examines the claim, questions the car repossession company who show him their purchased judgement against L. The court examines this judgement and finds no fault with it.
Finding no fault, the judge voids the claim against the car possession company and grants the car company their countersuit of lawyers' fees for a fake lawsuit where they'd done no wrong, to be paid by L. 
So now L owes them $5,000 dollars. Does he wise up this time and pay them, or wait to have his assets seized?
In this entire tale, the only instance of aggression depicted is L breaking his agreement to not wear shoes in X's house.

By leaving their jurisdiction: &gt; What I'm saying is you can't do it unless you control it, and believe it or not, there is a way.
You can't control any politician. Voting for or against them just shuffles the deck. You don't ever get to vote for policies, only people who claim to be for a policy and then have no legal duty to actually support it.








You misunderstand. By pushing getting money out of politics, all you did was give them a new angle to exploit. The democrats were strongly against getting money out of politics, right? So they limited donations that republicans were likely to make, ie: from corporations, and left zero limits on donations from unions.
You only helped their goal of advancing their own power thereby.








An amendment that must be enforced by the very people you intend to limit with it? And you wonder why it wouldn't work? Don't you see the contradiction in that? 


Listen, no matter what scheme you come up with, there's a way around it. Even if you got all the money out of politics, how do you avoid the standard post-office quid pro quo? Many politicians get cushy jobs in the very industry they regulated as politicans! That can be separated by years from favorable policy to payoff for that politician after leaving office. They still become rich and by your standard they wouldn't have taken even a single bribe while in office. All that they need is a promise of a cushy job after office.








So stop thinking in terms of existing society. I agree the US has massive political momentum. No one has significantly altered it since the founding. So stop trying.


Good luck. I think you'll be disappointed yet again. I won't say it can't happen but I really doubt it, given history of these things. 
How many people are against the income tax? Yet we can't even get that repealed.








You're suggesting public financing, which means you are supporting the theft of taxpayers to pay for politics. No thanks. And again, such laws have always been prejudicially applied to give one party or the other an electoral advantage, which is the only reason the democrats were upset about the supreme court voiding that law. Not because it did anything to remove money from politics, it didn't, it just gave them an electoral advantage over the right.
The naivete here is imagining you can actually come up with a scheme that does what you're trying to do. I spent some 20 years trying to come up with such a scheme only to realize it's impossible. Every scheme can be routed around one way or another.
The only, only solution is to reject the idea that there must be someone in society who can force laws on everyone else. If you do that, then there is no one to bribe in the first place, because there are no more politicians.
That will actually work, because if you're allowed to make laws for yourself, you will never take advantage of yourself, why would you. And no one will be able to bribe you to accept a law that hurts you.

It doesn't ahve legal means of its own accord, only that which is given to it by others, by contract, and which can be withdrawn at any time.


But no matter what laws you create, to have authority over another person they must first accept your laws.
That you make such a basic error about voluntarist law is unfortunate, and telling. In a polycentric system, your law that you can make is authoritative only over the property you control, not over others or others' property.
So your reasoning here fails.


By what means? Your org can't even get that far. This is not even inductive evidence, this is merely a claim without supporting rationale. You give no reason as to why you expect this to happen or how it could be achieved.
This corrupt org can't simply buy anyone it wants. It must obtain the consent of sellers. Would a security org sell out to a suspected criminal security org? Not likely.


Why won't they scale up? To scale up you need two major things: space and water access.
A seastead has both of those things in far, far, far, far greater abundance than any terran city on the planet. I can see seasteading cities of a billion citizens or more without any problem.


But you neglect the fact that a polycentric system has no claim on income. It can only attract customers. So what net profit is it making?
If it pisses off customers through continual centralization, they can and will flee it, because they can see the problem you're posing as clearly as you can.








"Less in number" is an extremely vague phrase. Are you saying more employees vs all the other ones? What makes you think that's the key factor? The Israelis took on what, seven Muslim nations with orders of magnitude more numbers and won with superior tech. Numbers ain't everything.


That may be your expectation, but not mine. Your scenario assumes people are incredibly stupid. Mine doesn't.


Lol, I don't think so.


They'd be found out and taken down. You haven't studied ancap legal justice much have you. Anyone discovering who the true killer was would be rich.








Nah, only in political systems premised on collectivism. A polycentric system is premised on individualism and will actually grow more individualist and experience increasingly decentralized power structures rather than what you claim here.


I'm talking about something new: individualist political systems. Simply citing every past political system that has been premised on collectivism is meaningless.




Something new...


The claim of 'something new' is my extraordinary evidence.


Status quo bias works until it doesn't. Then after the fact you will figure out where you were wrong.


Bald assertion without supporting evidence.








Yep, and how many governments are there? A lot more than there used to be. Which means that the rule of polycentrism is not only already active, it's winning out. There are more countries today than there were 50 years ago, and far more then than before.
Project that trend ahead and soon every person will be a sovereign over their own lives. And that is the height of the polycentric program.

If bitcoin replaced all world currencies, it would have to be worth about $3 million each to accommodate that volume. There's your analysis. This has been computed many times.
As for why that should happen necessarily, it's because bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions, and the world is increasingly one where all transactions are online and distanced transactions, even in-store transactions today have online components.
I take a long view. In the face of this compelling business case for bitcoin, it, or another cryptocurrency, but certainly some cryptocurrency, is quite likely to take over the world.
The uncertainty is not if this will happen--it will happen. The uncertainty is if it will be this cryptocurrency that wins, and how long it ends up taking.
Will it be this bitcoin? Unless another cryptocoin can come along and do what bitcoin *cannot do*, then it will be this bitcoin due to the network effect and path dependence effect. I think it very unlikely that another coin will be able to do what bitcoin cannot do, since both are characterized by code and code can be adopted, and only open-source code will be adopted. So if a feature ever appears that's so good as to challenge bitcoin, bitcoin devs will adopt it and squash the other coin like a bug.
Once you understand all these angles, it looks like a sure thing. Much in the way that many of us were saying early on that the internet would change everything, and the mainstream was completely skeptical.
Well here's another thing the internet will change: money.

You imagine that monopoly is possible without the ability for some in society to force laws on others in society--but it is not. This is a common misunderstanding.
There's no competitive mechanism by which a monopoly can be maintained, only by law can it be done. And that only by coercive law, not voluntary law such as a polycentric-legal system would present.
And as for maximizing profitability, that depends on whether there are unlimited economies of scale in security production--which is so extremely unlikely that I'd bet my life there isn't, since there is not yet any business discovered with unlimited economies of scale of production. Internet businesses come close though.
But security is inherently a human-based business.
Currently police forces at best cover cities, not multiple cities. And most likely a police force like LAPD is already far larger than economies of scale would maximize as ideally profitable.
So, your fear is unfounded and based on ignorance of economic principles that counter your expectation.








Corruption requires the ability to force laws on others in society--which again, a polycentric legal system denies to everyone.
The reason it requires legitimacy via ideology is that without that it will face active resistance by the citizenry and be ended.
Again, you assume and are thinking from a non-polycentric legal system where some entity in society has the legitimacy to force laws on everyone else.
This does not exist in a polycentric system where voluntary law is the rule of the day and everyone can make their own laws--there is no elections--and there is no monopoly on law production.
















Really? So when the LAPD was shown to be a corrupt police force, show me all the people that canceled their contracts with the LAPD and hired a new police department to patrol their inner-city neighborhoods.

o_O uh what? If bitcoin goes into common usage that would mean demand for it would skyrocket, which means the price must go up considerably. By what mechanism do you see price going downward?


I don't know what economics you studied but you seem to be missing something. The price of bitcoin is determined by the supply and demand curves, like anything else. Bitcoin is supply constrained so mainly demand determines its price (although the situation is more complex for supply due to speculators).
If the price goes up considerably this will draw lots of bitcoin out of savings, increasing supply leading to a drop from the high, but it's still likely to be a new high that is much higher than it is now, just as has happened over and over again in the last two years.
After $260 last year it cut down to $70, then from $70 to $110 to $1200 then cut back to $400, and now we're at $640 with no sign of going downward again.

No, they weren't. The industrial revolution, the most prosperous rise in wealth in history, was achieved on a gold currency basis.








No, I don't assume you can create value by splitting btc. But neither do I assume btc has one inherent value. Btc can gain in value in accordance with the network effect and path dependence. The more people using btc, the more valuable it becomes to all of them, much like a fax machine or email.








Basic economics--that you are wrong about. Inflation is not good for the economy. Inflation is *theft*, value taken from all holders of that currency transferred to the entity that control the amount of currency in society.
You have been lied to by economists who goal is to legitimate inflation by politicians because that's what governments want to do, enrich themselves via inflation. Inflation is an invisible means of wealth confiscation that the voting populace doesn't easily understand and thus it is low risk for them to steal by that method. It's an invisible tax. It is not 'good for the economy'.
You're a victim of Keynesian bad economic theory. You should look into much more sound Austrian economics and come back to this discussion.


We shall see, won't we. I'm not worried. Clearly it's your belief in bad economic theory that has driven you to oppose bitcoin. But if my economic theory is correct, then my life savings is perfectly positioned. And I, at least, am sure enough in it to have taken a risk like that. Can you say the same?

If miners didn't mine for the duration of one adjustment, the next adjustment would be lower-than-it-should-be.
Turn on a bunch of mining rigs with the lower-than-it-should-be difficulty, and you'll mine blocks faster.
Exaggerated example:
- 99.9% of miners quit for 2016 blocks, leaving just one CPU to mine blocks
- Difficulty drops to a ridiculously low number
- Reactivate 99% of miners, mint the coins that should have been untouchable until the far future.
It's worth noting that we are ahead of schedule already, because of this effect occurring naturally as hashrate increases during a fixed difficulty period.

Lookup economist Peter Surda's 2012 masters thesis on Bitcoin.
In it he explains that bitcoin has innate value because it is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions.
And it has value over other altcoins because of the network effect, by which a thing is more valuable to users according to how many others have bought into that thing (think Facebook and other social media), and path dependence whereby the choices you make influence future choices. Thus buying into bitcoin gives incentive to avoid other altcoins.
These are the core reasons why bitcoin will win, has value, and cannot be stopped.
Because bitcoin saves both parties money on every transaction, its value to society is measured in its current price--which is actually far lower right now than its true value were it used economy-wide, which is why bitcoin makes a great investment.
But if you don't understand those facts, you would tend to think of bitcoin as a mere bubble or scam. But those of us who do understand them consider it more like a sure thing.
This is the difference between strong hands and weak hands.

You don't understand bitcoin very well, do you. It is practically the definition of anti-fragile. It does not rely on any person, entity, etc.
Countries are extremely fragile by comparison.
Btw, most governments in existence today are less than 300 years old in terms of political continuity. Democracy largely conquered the political world in the 18th and 19th.

Part 1:
Well, I have to hand it to you, that was among the most awesome bitcoin-skeptic post I've seen in a long time :) You're completely wrong, of course, but someone as committed to your position as you seem to be is unlikely to waver, even in the face of evidence. But I'll at least lay out for you why I think you're wrong, so that in the future you can at least see my predictions come true and maybe have a basis for explaining why your predictions have not come true.










This isn't true in the slightest. Bitcoin is a special class of good whose value is purely exchange value. That is to say, and this is undeniable, that bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency available for international and online transactions.
There is a category error being made here by many even economists much less lay thinkers. We have tended to think about bitcoin in commodity terms, because previously all monies, and all goods really, have been physical commodities. Bitcoin has a vanishingly small commodity value (a bit of electricity and disk space), but a relatively high exchange value based on it being the lowest transaction-cost currency distanced transactions.
This IS the value it has, Value AS a currency. That trips a lot of people up. Theories of money have tended to assume a thing must have commodity value before it can have exchange value. In bitcoin's case, this isn't so. You can USE bitcoin as a currency, and its utility is inherently tied to its use as a currency.


Yes. Exactly so. And there's nothing wrong with that. If it weren't the lowest transaction-cost currency, then people wouldn't be using it that way, or its price would eventually crash and the bubble burst. But because it has that compelling value proposition of being the lowest trasnaction-cost currency, it's going to remain in use and the price will continue to rise until it finds its nature price.


Only in the short term. Once it finds its natural price and achieves full market penetration, the speculation will die out and volatility will be tamed.
Volatility is the -only- play the bitcoin-skeptics have left, but it will solve itself in time, with use, and with greater demand.


True, but it's likely that its value to the economy overall is much higher than its current price. That is what the speculators are speculating on. If bitcoin took over the world financial system, one bitcoin would have to be worth about $3 million a piece to accommodate world transactions.


You assume you know what the value is. This is a **major error** in your thinking and skepticism. And what's worse, you imagine that value is actually lower than the current price! Hah! But you ignore the fact of lower transaction costs when using bitcoin.
The simple fact is that bitcoin makes every distanced transaction about 1% - 3% cheaper. If you do the math on the number of global transactions, their amount, and the multiple by what bitcoin could save all users of currency, it comes out to about half a trillion to $2 trillion a year depending. Divide by the total number of bitcoin and that would be your potential maximum price. At the low end that would be a price of at least $35k per bitcoin.
But I'm sure you will laugh at that, given your current assumptions about bitcoin which are wholly fallacious.


The reverse is true, because a higher price will tame volatility and allow larger transactions to occur, which is necessary for use as a global currency (ie: for oil purchases and the like).


You do know that 1 btc is divisible into 100 million units, right? Each bitcoin has more than enough subdivisions to accommodate world economic demand. The price can rise by orders of magnitude and it won't inhibit people's ability to buy bitcoin in fractional amounts needed to do any kind of transaction.


Completely wrong, see above.


Reasoned speculation based on its low transaction costs and likely world demand. People a lot smarter than yourself in the investment world are buying into bitcoin *because they've done the numbers* whereas you seem completely mistaken about the number and the promise of bitcoin.


1 - 3% savings on every transaction justifies today's price and a whoooole lot more.


Except its nature as the lowest transaction-cost currency for international and online transactions, which you seem wholly ignorant about. Go read economist Peter Surda's 2012 master's thesis on bitcoin wherein he makes this assertion.


Wrong. The current price is what it is *because* of supply and demand--that is necessarily so. I can't believe you don't even understand that much.


One man's insanity is another's great deal--based on what each understands. You wholly misunderstand bitcoin, thus you think its price insane. But perhaps you should check your understanding.


Now you're a master programmer and cryptographer?


And ideologically-driven skeptics.


Which is fantastic, since the best currencies historically have been based on unchangeable facets of reality, ie: what backing does gold have? Just the fact that there's only so much gold in reality and you can't cheaply make more of it.
Similarly, bitcoin is "backed" by the laws of mathematics that can't be cheated.
Fiat currencies backed by governments suck. They're prone to inflation and inflation is theft. You're probably one of those people who think inflation is a good thing too, huh. lol


Good. Neither does gold have regulation.


Gold lost 25% of its value this year. That doesn't make it a bad currency.


To be expected for its newness and age and market cap.


It's the wild west. Buyer beware.


Bitcoin is not a business.


Or a financial revolution that many will miss from preconceived notions and biases. Like yourself.


You're going to find out that you're extremely wrong. But by all means, keep waiting for bitcoin to fail. Its price is all the argument I need. I haven't changed my tune since bitoin was $12 a piece and I put my life savings into it after studying its potential as a currency for six months. But hey, what do I know
You, however, due to your bad economic ideas and preconceived notions about currencies, and lack of vision of what's wrong with our financial system and how bitcoin can fix it, has missed the bus entirely. And now you're rationalizing your loss. And each day bitcoin doesn't fail just makes you more and more angry, doesn't it :)

Whatcha mean? Aggression is never okay. He was asking what it was about governments making drugs illegal that causes forced to be used in their manufacture and supply.
I was at no point justifying the use of force, only establishing a link between criminalization and use of force by these people.








What are you even talking about.
Let's go back to my original statement: nothing about the selling of drugs necessitates the use of violence. If there is violence in drug trade and manufacture it is because the desired chemical has been criminalized. Thus we can blame drug laws for drug violence. We know this because legal drugs don't have the same instances of violence surrounding their manufacture and distribution.

It doesn't matter if they care, the economics will drive people towards it. You're likely making a big mistake.
The reason for bitcoin is that it's the lowest transaction-cost for online and distanced transaction, by a couple percents at least.
That will inexorably drive adoption, whether people care or not. You're being short-sighted, impatient, etc.
Most people can't figure these things out for themselves, so they look to those who are able to do the math to figure it out, and a lot of those people are into bitcoin now and jumping every day. You seem to be jumping out before the real tipping point hits. Shame.

Traders actually have the effect of reducing volatility, since they see profit opportunities in radical swings and invest against unsupported price swings.
Ie: if the price gets way below the fundamentals, they can profit by buying and waiting for it to go up. Similarly if the market gets emotional and the price zooms way high, they sell to profit take, thus reducing volatility and evening out demand.
Rinse and repeat.
The volatility argument won't stop bitcoin, as much as opponents are assuring themselves and praying that it will.

Most people don't understand that it functions as a tax, inflation is invisible and thus political tenable.


There is no center to attack, bitcoin is the first major decentralized application. The Liberty Dollar went down simply by raiding its center, the LD company and arresting its owners and principals. 
Who do you arrest to hurt bitcoin? Satoshi Nakamoto?
Undoubtedly they would've tried, which is why he's anonymous, but it wouldn't have done anything but serve as payback for TPTB.
Bitcoin isn't something a government can simply stop. They can outlaw it in their territory as much as possible, having about as much effectiveness as outlawing torrents / file sharing, or trying to take down the Pirate Bay or Wikileaks.
Which is to say, they can't. And attempting to do so risks Streisand-effecting it. The gov right now is trying to buy time, keep bitcoin quiet, put a few roadblocks in the way, find a way to attack it.
Ultimately we're betting they will fail to find an effective means, just as they can't stop torrents.
What's more they *shouldn't* stop bitcoin, since it's nothing but voluntary exchange.
That which threatens government interests to the benefit of the population shouldn't be attacked, that's a conflict of interest and literal exploitation by the gov of all people.
If they shutdown legal uses in any one country and it later becomes large in countries that did not shut it down, it could be as large as countries that ignored or outlawed the internet, business will move to those countries and turn them into profit and tax centers. So governments, including the US, are also afraid to do this.

Except for the fact that you're now trusting them. They wouldn't let others mine, no point, they'd just control the whole thing themselves, and that would harm trust in it, meaning they couldn't compete with bitcoin which already has trust.
Plus now you have to go to them for redemption, since they're backing it with dollars, and how do you know they haven't double-spent the dollars behind it? Now you have to audit them, then audit the auditor to make sure they're not in cahoots.
Who pays for this?

If you think your dollars are working just fine then you aren't paying attention, or are blind to how dollars are screwing you over.
Yearly inflation steals probably more than 5% of your dollar-denominated value from you, and raises cost of living by preventing it from falling--which becomes invisible to you and thus ignored by you.
Capital controls are designed to fence you in to a country. Do you really own money that the government won't let you ultimately control? Try to send money anywhere in the world in 24 hours? Difficult and expensive.
And bailing-in haircuts are happening all around the world, most recently in Spain and Cyprus--do you think the dollar is immune? It will come here.
Because debts are out of control. The US gov racks up massive debts daily and expects you to pay for it as a dollar user. In fact, the government borrows to pay the interest payments on its past borrowing--which is a recipe for debt explosion.
And lastly, the dollar as a fiat currency will survive and have only long as people have faith in it. With the above problems deepening, how long will faith last?
Bitcoin solves all of those problems and then some.

They provide price information ahead of time. They are useful, believe it or not, for reducing valuation swings. They create incentive for ferreting out price-sensitive information about the asset.

Not only that, but it functions as a 4% tax that is politically viable since it's well hidden, very few citizens can understand how that steals value from their pockets. It also constitutes a wealth transfer from poor to rich, and the poor aren't well informed or educated.

Would you support giving someone who commits that assault the death penalty?
I support fining someone caught drunk driving and sanctioning their license. I don't support putting them in jail, convicting them of a felony, and ruining their life for not harming anyone.








I don't care, what I care about is justice, and the fact that the punishment must fit the crime, and it is not just to throw someone in jail who hasn't hurt anyone. Risky behavior is not the same thing as the actuality of that risk.

It is not hierarchy we are against, it is coercive hierarchy, which is to say it is coercion that is objectionable, not hierarchy. Leftanarchs have gone off the rails by focusing on hierarchy as a heuristic for discovering coercion, and then over time came to focus on the heuristic instead of the principle behind it.
For that reason, most left-archs, including those from the sub you suggest, are not real anarchs. They often suggest they would prefer a society **that uses actual coercion** to prevent the kinds of transactions they object to--in short they want to establish their own hierarchy, just one they don't object to.
Meanwheil ancaps are actual anarchs because we are voluntarists--we would have you choose your own level of hierarchy, from zero to as much as you like, only we won't accept coercion.

Volatility is a function of market cap, speculation, and low sustained demand. Right now speculation is driving volatility, but if you start running regular economic transactions reflective of actual commerce, that volatility disappears.

When inflation is a result of printing money, then it IS theft. Because that printed money constitutes a wealth transfer from all holders of cash to the newly printed money.
As a short and base example, if the economy has $9 and you print $1, then that $1 value has to come from somewhere. So it comes from the other $10, which now become each worth $0.90. There's not more wealth in the economy just because you print another dollar, but there are more dollars, so this must happen.
This is why Austrian economics call inflation a monetary phenomena--it is created by monetary creation. When the amount of wealth in a society is held constant and the amount of money increases, you get price inflation. There are demand issues in the mix as well.
Deflation, by contrast is the opposite. When the amount of wealth increases but the amount of money in the economy is held constant, the result is deflation. Demand issues, again, play a role. Demand may increase if foreigners would rather have dollars than other currencies, or if more people are born and begin demanding dollars, resulting in deflation. But those are secondary to the quantity of money in the economy typically.


So you're completely wrong. If the gov prints money, that value comes from all holders of dollars. And that IS THEFT.

Ostensibly you don't own that land, so you would be thereby forcing your will on those people, whom would then sue you for redress and clean-up or even estoppel as it's happening. It's a case of 'your rights end where mine begin.' You don't have the right to pollute the property of others, even if you have the right to do what you want on your own land. This is how and why a free society of property rights should be better on environmental protection than state-reliant regions where the government can be bribed to allow pollution to companies.
















The accountability is actually far greater than now. State courts don't have to have a reputation for being fair, they monopolize regions legally and trials must come through them.
By contrast a market court must trade on its reputation for fair dealing and justice. Without a reputation and bona fides, it won't earn any clients, because it doesn't have and cannot have a regional monopoly.
Read Friedman's Machinery of Freedom, he erases such standard objections.
















No, states do not obtain your consent before they force their will on you. They assume you are under their jurisdiction merely because you're born or live there, and you cannot individually secede from their power over you--you have to physically leave. Implied consent is not the same thing as actual consent.
















Nope! Communities of legal agreement are run completely differently from the way countries and states are run. Just because one aspect is similar doesn't mean it's in all ways similar.








In a region that takes consent seriously, you would be able to withdraw consent *and stay in place* since consent is prior to authority.

That's not entirely true. They could also have a fixed supply and demand for them could fall, dropping prices. Also, as more people come to value bitcoin (ie: as more people are born) there's a natural price deflation, *ceteris paribus*, just more people demanding the fixed supply of bitcoin.
And as wealth is created yearly and transferred in a fixed supply of money, there would as a combination of these factors, be continual deflation, including price and wage deflation. During much of the 19th century the US economy was deflationary, using a gold-based money, and workers did indeed accept wage cuts as deflation happened, but this was no big deal since prices were also going down at the same time.
The mistake in his quote is to imply therefore that the economy is not growing! On this he's entirely wrong, the economy can experience deflation and continue to grow just fine. It's only in the modern inflationary world where we experience bubbles and the resulting deflationary-spiral that deflation and negative-growth are correlated, but that's actually caused by the kind of monetary interventions that central bankers want to continue to be able to do, which is why they support inflationary currencies.


















The price cuts people take in a deflationary economy are to keep their purchasing power roughly the same, it's a deflationary COLA or cost of living adjustment. Again, it's not false, it did actually happen in the past, but it's not actually a negative thing at all as he makes it out to be.

It actually took them about 2 years to break Tor enough to take down the Silk Road founder. They had to invent new attacks.
Having done so, Tor is now evolving to prevent those successful attacks as well.
Tor is in early days yet. It's much like cryptography was in the 70's. With enough computing power you could break those passwords easily. But crypto today has vastly outrun the state. 
They can't use that attack vector anymore with any expectation of real success. So they've moved to other vectors.
But eventually they can run out of vectors.
For instance, crypto right now at the bleeding edge is beat via device corruption at the hardware and microcode levels. They'll intercept hardware bought by a target en-route and mess with it such that it reports back to them, either infecting it or putting a dialer on there, etc.
But that relies on the concept of distributed manufacturing. What happens when you can 3D print a computer at home yourself? There's nothing left to intercept.

Of course it is. The question is are they fighting each other to sell drugs. Answer, clearly not.


Valid question. Drug manufacturers, transporters, and shippers in the black market are forced to rely on violence to enforce their business relationships and contracts because they cannot use the peaceful remedies of courts due to the illegality of their business.
If the items being made were legal, they'd be as peaceful as Pfizer and Bayer.
And because drugs are illegal, these criminal organizations are able to make profits far in excess of the cost of doing business, which encourages them to hold turfs on a monopolistic basis, again enforced via violence.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.
The reason they want to inflate is because they're the ones that get to inflate, meaning they can create money out of thin air and spend it before the inflation hits (because inflation is created by that act of spending and doesn't exist until it is spent).
Thus, governments can literally steal 3% a year (or however much they inflate), legally, by issuing their own currency. They obtain therefore a lot of their wealth and power from inflation.
The gold standard was dropped then because the government wanted to inflate, not because inflation does any of the things you say or has any good effects--it doesn't. It's just politically popular among the voting masses who are by and large debtors and thus benefit minorly from deflation, and politicians can steal from the whole society in an invisibly fashion.

Point out that exchange risk is removed from the equation by payment processing companies like Bitpay / Coinbase.
And then push the benefits to retailers of bitcoin, no chargebacks, fraud, transaction costs, etc. And the payment processors charge flat fees too (Bitpay is $30 / mo unlimited transactions, iirc).
The bigger issue is demographic, is it worth it to them to train their people and juggle another payment processor relationship if their demographic is the elderly or something, the least likely to own and use bitcoin. That's a business calculation from there.


But that's not the meaning of a weak hand. A weak hand is someone who doesn't understand bitcoin themselves, who have jumped on the bandwagon or taken someone else's word, and thus are much more subject to fear and FUD than others, because they haven't done their due diligence personally.
Weak hands can only be cured by doing their homework personally so as to set their minds at ease. I know enough about bitcoin now to simply chuckle at price swings. The cryptocurrency revolution will happen one way or the other *because* of its compelling value proposition of being the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions. Nothing can change that.

The great thing about [TOR](is that it costs attackers millions of dollars and months or years of effort to exploit a weakness, and then the programmers figure out what went wrong and patch it for perhaps a few thousand dollars during an afternoon, or at worse a few weeks.
That kind of asymmetrical power means the government have no chance of winning long term. They can find flaws, but they cannot use them systematically for fear of exposing their hand and the flaw being patched.
Look how long it took them to catch DPRoberts by breaking TOR, two years and how many millions. And by doing so they spurred new development in hardening TOR.
Look also at the Stuxnet virus, once again they spent millions and years on developing a new secret theory of math just to break a certain kind of encryption and exploit a certain flaw in operating systems, only to blow that ability by using it, rendering it useless, or at least inoculating the world's system with it.
And Germany is now returning to mechanical typewriters! Lol. 
The government loses because it's a small number of people trying to track a very large number of people. And we can all do small things to make that difficult or impossible for them.
And cryptography is already well beyond their power to crack, so they must go via other routes, more expensive routes.
But we will keep hardening those routes, until they're lost.
I feel like TOR is still a fairly young technology then. Perhaps the Tails browser will go a long way towards making it easy for the rest of us.

Right, so at the very least it would prove he WAS solvent. Whereas, we actually suspect he wasn't solvent in the first place and is faking a hack to cover his lack of solvency.
So if we can establish he was solvent then there's a chance he was really hacked. If he wasn't solvent in the first place, then he is likely guilty of wrongdoing well before this date.
It's actually pretty easy and fairly cheap to not get hacked if you know what you're doing, and especially if you're holding coins for others, and especially especially if you're holding large amounts. There are good procedures for using fresh computers and off-net signing of transactions on a virgin computer, etc.

I was thinking today how small bitcoin still is, worth just about $5 billion, right? The US economy alone is $16 trillion. If bitcoin's market cap expanded to even $1 trillion the price would have to be like $76,000 a piece. Who knows what it would take for that to end up happening, but this is part of the promise of bitcoin today.
So today Bitpay (alone) passes $1m a day, awesome for them!

I didn't avoid it, I said implicitly yes that poor people have money they could be investing, but that the more important aspect is that they are disincentivized to invest. Again, the average poor person spends a far higher proportion of their income on luxury goods than most people. In one case, a poor person spent 25% of their income on cigarettes. Don't tell me poor people don't have money they could be investing. They are typically poor due in part to bad money handling habits handed down culturally. And what better way to produce a culture of non-investment and non-savings than to disincentivize saving and investing through inflation--this is the aspect you want to ignore and avoid.
Go read "Life at the Bottom."
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:21:41
I should think it would be much more encouraging to save if you knew that your money would deflate when saved rather than inflate.
An inflating economy encourages borrowing--and the rich are the most able to borrow, by borrowing against their assets. The poor least able to borrow.
In a deflating economy the rich don't get the plum of easy credit and borrowing, and the poor get to hold cash without its value being drained invisibly by inflation.
If you don't think that's a better situation than what we have now there's something wrong with you.

Volatility is just a function of its youth, low market-cap, and the uncertainty surrounding it. If bitcoin does become mainstream acceptable and services entire economies, its price would become rock solid and perfectly fine for value-storage.
At that point, with dozens of trillions in market cap, even moving billions of dollars in bitcoin wouldn't visibly affect the price.
So you may be right that it's not great for stored value now (although it has been trending upward in the long-term so that's debateable too)--mainly if you think you might need the money in the near-term and thus can't ride out price swings, but there's absolutely no reason to think that such volatility is a given in the long-run and with higher market caps.

Again, please go [read up](on polycentric law. Firstly, the rule is that apart from basic property protection and security of person, no one has any authority over you that you don't give them, as long as you don't violate other's basic rights.
That takes care of interactions outside a community of legal agreement.
But once you get inside a COLA, you have to agree to the entry agreement, which goes over all contingencies and also what happens to you if your break contracts. So you adopt those laws for yourself, by contract.
So you agree in advance as to what remedy will take place if you break contracts, and you agree that contracts can be enforced against you in the following manners.
Thus this is not a monopoly of power, it's a limited grant. And this contact need not be enforced by any one security service in that COLA, it could be enforced by multiple such agencies. No monopoly needed. 
And if you decide you don't want to live under those laws anymore, you simply declare your intent to secede, and follow the entry agreement for leaving that jurisdiction that you'd already agreed to, if it declares such provisions at all.


No, it doesn't. It requires only defensive coercion. Let's say you agreed in advance by contract to make full restitution for any thefts you may commit. Then you steal something and are caught. It would be aggression to not pay back when you owe as you already agreed to do. By making you live up to your agreement the security agency is using only defensive coercion, not any aggression at all.


No it doesn't. Aggression means the overstepping of the property boundary of another's property without permission. One can live their whole life without ever committing aggression. I don't think you understand the way I'm using the term 'aggression' which means the 'initiation of coercion.' If your property is violated, you can defend it with force, and that is responsive or defensive coercion--not aggression. The aggressor is the first one to overstep the property boundary, whom you're defending against.


Nope. You don't understand aggression to hold this view. It's a technical point, but once you understand it the difference is clear.
















Here's where you're 100% wrong. Aggression is defined as the initiation of coercion. Initiation can be measured objectively via time. And property can be measured objectively in the real world via property boundaries. The first one in time to cross a property boundary is the aggressor--objectively. There is no wiggle room for who is the aggressor and who is the defender. At all./


Coercion, not aggression. Coercion means simply force, it does not differentiate between ethical uses of force and unethical. Defensive coercion and aggression are the two terms for ethical and unethical uses of force.


Coercion is necessary to enforce law (ie: defensive violence), but aggression isn't. 








I don't ask you to change the current system, actually. We're going to seastead and build a new system from scratch. You can observe the results and see if you want what it produces from there. I don't care about moral arguments, even though I think it morally far superior, I care about the end result.
The moral argument is simple, all activities that everyone considers immoral have one common element: they are examples of aggression, the initiatory use of violence/coercion.
Thus, building a society that minimizes aggression will produce the best possible society.
You're free to stay in your society rife with aggression and the evils it produces. I want out.


Any political system that uses coercion to keep other system from competing with it--that is they hold a territorial monopoly--are committing constant aggression against their citizenry. The result is that the people are captive buyers, paying the highest monopoly price and receiving the lowest-quality monopoly service for their dollars.
We offer a competing alternative that will work in the real world--a competitive legal system where each person decides how much they want to pay, and what services they want to pay for, and they cannot be forced to pay any certain amount (ie: taxes), but they can setup systems that do rely on the tax if that's what they think is better.
In short, a polycentric system can replicate anything you think is required to run a current society, but can do so while preserving voluntarism (ie: communities of legal agreement are always opt-in whereas our current society assumes you're in and you must opt-out, often with great difficulty and expense).








Nope. You don't understand the problem nor the solution. The problem is not the use of force to enforce contracts, the problem is the government's use of aggression to maintain a monopoly on rule. A polycentric system has no monopoly on rule, and trying to obtain one would be considered a crime. It's fundamentally what you're saying here is impossible.


The problems are inherently structural. What if I told you that [democracy is the problem](How do you "improve shortcomings" when the system is literally based on the problem that needs to be improved.
What replaces voting in a polycentric system is property ownership. Each person controls the laws operating on their property 100%, and then visits other properties by negotiation as to the legal terms of that visit.
Because it would be annoying to sign a contract every 20 feet you go, it's likely that people will group together in communities of legal agreement (COLAs) which are regions where all the property owners in that place have accepted the same legal basis for their properties, then moved all their property together into contiguous boundaries. Here parties to the entry agreement can move freely without having to sign new contracts, since everyone allowed in is a party to the same agreement.








It's not merely about the moral argument, it's about applying the incentives of the market to the services of governance that any society requires simply to exist.
For instance, right now we have a government monopoly on law production. Why? Let each person make law for their own property and no other, let each visitor either agree or disagree to visit on that basis, let negotiation establish norms. 
Governments have a monopoly on the service of policing. Why? We just end up paying the highest possible monopolist price and getting the lowest monopolist service. It is this way with all legal monopolies.
And why let government monopolize courts, we have private arbitration now and it's more popular than gov courts--so why are we forced to pay for gov courts?
Governments now monopolize currency too, and bitcoin is freeing us from that as well, at a far cheaper cost too.
All these things don't require government to provide, there are market-based alternatives that should work as well or better, even if they're not perfect either.








Well you haven't read enough to understand the non-aggression principle fully, which winnows the difference between aggressive and defensive coercion. So perhaps there is something to that charge you keep hearing :\

The second you introduce any form of voting control, you introduce politics, and the ability of people with power, like the ones you're talking about here, to literally manipulate the market behind the scenes.
By keeping bitcoin purely in the market, we prevent that.
If you think an alternate system would be better, one that incorporates your idea of democratic control, you need only clone bitcoin and patch that into the system and see if you can get traction for that idea.
However, I don't think you will get it. Because that idea is a far worse one than market control of bitcoin generally. What you think of as a boon would actually become its Achilles' heel.

Not really, because all that does is create a black market. This doesn't destroy the market for that good at all. It would be the drug war all over again, but it doesn't kill bitcoin, just delays its acceptance there. Meanwhile other areas *won't* criminalize bitcoin and will reap the rewards making the places that did criminalize look dumb.




They're unlikely to get it made illegal everywhere, all at once. In any case, if people use it, they ultimately can't stop them. Just like the marijuana black market, which now is moving towards acceptance.








Great, *but that doesn't kill bitcoin*. In fact it would likely Streisand effect bitcoin. If the US and its allies try to stamp out bitcoin, what better way for countries that hate the US to irk it than to USE bitcoin? You'd have Russia, China, and much of the middle east and Africa suddenly going whole hog into bitcoin. One day you have OPEC nations selling oil for bitcoin just to make fun of the US because they'd have to grant waivers from the law for their own oil refiners to buy bitcoin to buy oil.
That's not generally how the gov operates. They try to be more subtle, try to encumber things with regulations, slow down the participants. But there's no center to attack, thus they're stymied.








Those attacks have been around for decades, so it would be a silly thing. Any rhetorical attack on bitcoin needs to not be equally true for the dollar, and so far none exists. E.g.: If they say bitcoin is used in drug transactions, so are dollars only a helluva lot more often and far less traceable.

Yes, there's plenty of red flags in there and I consider the narrative suspect as well. For instance he mentions being 'into' bitcoin, and FPGA gives some indication of timing (say early to mid last year), but maybe he was just into tech and could give a damn about the actual currency, until he was commissioned to study it, and never really considered its effect as a currency taking over, because being a professional economist he may have had certain professional biases that are not easily overcome, so it just didn't occur to him as anything more than cool tech.
Such things can happen. But still, on balance, I'm inclined towards disbelief in the narrative as given.

Your eyes aren't opened to the true nature of government. Bitcoin was created by people who have pulled the gauze of statism from their eyes with much difficulty.
Bitcoin cannot be divorced from its anti-state implications. It was created to route around a state that uses control of money to exploit others, and it only continues to work if that inherent decentralization continues to operate.
This means that bitcoin users will increasingly find their interests being beset upon by governments, whom see bitcoin as an attack on their wealth and exploitative control of money.
Which is why bitcoin is a good example of the [Osmotic Strategy for Change]( in action, a way of bringing people towards anarchic values by having them live within an anarchic system rather than trying to argue them into the fold, or vote them into the fold.
If you do not yet hate government, the longer you're involved with bitcoin the more you will find yourself hating government, because the government can only maintain its monopoly on money and exploitation of the populace through money controls (ie: inflation and borrowing at your expense) by trying to take bitcoin away from you and make it useless to you.
Which is must inevitably fail to do.
So, stick around, I don't need to convince you to become an anarcho-capitalism, and you probably have a lot of misconceptions about that phrase in any case (lord knows I did back when I wasn't ancap). If you continue using bitcoin, you will find yourself inexorably moving towards the ancap position. Because our interests are aligned by the very nature of bitcoin, which has set its face against government control and exploitation.

There's scatterings of Austrian econ professors here and there. I don't know of any that have an explicitly Austrian program. The Chicago school is close, cousins to Austrian economics.
But what you have to realize is that these schools, especially at the top tiers, have an alliance with the state which funds them, and they serve a purpose in helping to legitimize state decisions. And because of this they have tended to sponsor and promotes economics which toes the state line. Most economics positions professionaly are in government or government-sponsored institutions, so it picks and chooses who it prefers. 
This is why you have Keynesians and monetarists everywhere. This is why Krugman regularly contradicts his own textbooks now that he has a column in the New York Times
E.g.: The government wants to inflate. It finds and promotes economists that provide an intellectual veneer and explanation of what it already wants to do. Inflation is not good for the economy, it's just a way to extract wealth from the entire society.
If you reject this then it's simply an argument from popularity. The fact is that Austrian theory has predicted many things that the Monetarists and Keynesians theory could not deal with or explain, like Stagflation and the housing crash, and why Bitcoin has value and will continue to have value.

The forces are already in play that will strangle the state, it's just a matter of time and circumstance from here.
Really the state was destroyed in the late 18th century via the classical liberal revolution, itself the product of Enlightenment thought, all of which eventually produced the modern world we live in today.
People of that era did not think that progress was possible for them and government openly exploited them as if it were their birthright. 
But after that era, governments have been forced to live hypocritical public lives, to hide the truth of what they're doing, to use propaganda and psychological force to convince the people to let them rule. This wasn't true in the vast history of humanity, yet it's world-wide today. The Pharaoh's slaves believed they were born to be slaves--today no one believes that. We have already won that argument, the rest is working out its implications
And the grand result will be, and has been, increasingly individualism, of which polycentric-law is the final destination and implication.
Beyond that the technological revolution is kicking the process of change into overdrive. What would've taken hundreds of years previously is perhaps now taking only decades. 
The state has slipped up in a few very important ways. First by acceding to the idea that people own themselves, back during the liberal revolution.
Secondly by allowing people to develop and use the internet--people will never again accept a world without internet, and governments find themselves repeatedly turning off the internet to protect their own interests (especially during unrest against government where the net is used to organize against them). The statists have always had an organization advantage over everyday citizens, and increasingly that is lost to them, and they are even finding themselves behind the curve.
Next is the development of cryptography. Modern governments are only, only possible because of the advent of modern intelligence gathering operations. This was made clear to me in reading a book about the history of intelligence operations. Strong crypto is destroying the gov's ability to know everything that's happening, and making good intelligence more and more expensive.
Lastly bitcoin. The central stronghold of the state today is control of currency. If they lose that bastion, they will lose a great deal of wealth and therefore power and prestige.
We are not far off from total victory, first in small places and then in large.
I'm involved now in [seasteading](to create the first autonomous, state-free societies for permanent-living at sea.
Friend, it's closer than anyone realizes. And that's our major advantage. Because it seems far away and therefore non-threatening, we are able to operate openly.
Check the sidebar of polycentric-law, something called the Osmotic strategy for change explains how the masses can be converted to this new political reality without ever having to win an election or an argument with them.
In the same way that monarchy and dictatorship has collapsed in the face of democracy, democracy can and perhaps will collapse to the force of polycentric law.

Stocks aren't useful in the sense that bitcoin payment processing is useful, so the network effect doesn't apply, and path dependence much less so, acting only as one of many buying signals, not as a usability and thus buy-in signal.








There's a few problems with that scenario. 
1. Currency Competition: The US dollar still has to compete with any cryptocurrency, and in a free competition of currencies the dollar is always going to lose to a strictly supply-limited cryptocurrency. Because deflation is better for holders than inflation.
2. Accountability: You'd have to literally abandon cash to do this--and I have no doubt that the US would love to do so, so maybe you have something there.
At the end of the day, bitcoin would still be better than the dollar because the dollar can be inflated and bitcoin can't. Inflation gives the issuer the right to steal money from all holders of that currency, that's why governments want to inflate.
So, given a choice, to be stolen from or not be stolen from, which currency would you choose.

The only possible way it could be worse is that it exposes customers to business fraud risk rather than the other way around.
However this objection is easily dealt with, because businesses are going concerns with public faces and locations. They don't just slink into the night. If they defraud you, suing them is easy.
The current situation is much worse for everyone where random customers defraud businesses and many small businesses are literally driven to bankruptcy thereby.
I can't imagine in what other way you think bitcoin is worse. Simply don't use it then if you think that.
Fiat has massive existential risk, hyperinflation could set in any day. Fiat is continually inflating and always will--this is awful for consumers and encourages borrowing over saving, which is awful for society.

They don't, actually. Paying a security org to do something is *also* an exchange from one human being to another, one that they can and will refuse to do if they have compunctions against it.
If you're asking them to become outlaws, then you likely will be refused. The trick of the state is to do what outlaws do while avoiding the perception of it. Which would be denied them in a polycentric system.
And if you're trying to pay them to do something unethical, you will very likely be refused no matter how much money you're offering.

Majority consensus is not the only way to run a country. That's an inherently collectivist premise since it uses a means of discovering mass will and then forces that will on everyone.
You can also build an individualist system in which mass will is not allowed to trample individual will, where individual will functions as a trump card against mass will, and in such a society the minorities can protect their own rights by simply refusing to go along with the majority.
Such a society can be built using concepts being developed right now via [polycentric-law](and realized by means of technology that allows law trading, such as the [Bitlaw project](Criminals will be stopped and brought in by private security forces that replace the function of state police. Private courts will try them. And private law will be the basis on which they're convicted. And the rule of the day will be that one must consent to a law before it applies to them, and unless you consent you don't get into that town.

Austrian economics.
You were probably taught that natural monopolies exist, and probably in political science classes, not economics. Or else by Keynesian-leaning economics teachers.
But there is actually no such thing. All monopolies requite state privilege to become monopolies.
There's only one legitimate monopoly that can come about in a free market, and the best example is Alcoa. Alcoa became a so-called good monopoly by keeping its prices as low as possible and its service as high as possible. Thus no one wanted to compete with it because there was no profit to be had.
But were they exploiting anyone? Nope. That is the one case of an 'monopoly' produced by the free market created none of the negative problems people normally associate with monopoly, such as high prices and bad service.
For those last two things to appear, you need government privilege.

If all the people in its territory hire other security orgs to take down the rogue corporation, it won't have any profits. It must take a monopoly by ideology to do so, and a polycentric system denies it this ability by removing the monopolist of law production.

KYC and AML laws require them to know what their customer *is doing with their money*, ie if they detect strange use patterns that's a problem for them and can lead to a KYC audit from the fed and some incredibly expensive fines if they're found in the wrong--regardless of amount involved.
Bitcoin is still associated with buying illegal items online, thus it's a KYC headache if you mention buying bitcoin.

The funny thing is that the more legit bitcoin becomes the less likely profit-taking becomes. You can't spend a stock but you can spend bitcoin. Meaning that as adoption increases, there will likely be winnowing away from profit taking to a pure holding position, no matter who you are, because there's simply no need to take profit.
Apart from the arbitrage guys that is, but they're in and out temporarily all the time and that just props up liquidity, etc. 
Long term holders are by far the majority currently, and the higher bitcoin goes, and the more accepted it is at retailers, the less need to profit-take there is.

@_date: 2014-07-23 23:07:13
Because the law is being produced by each individual instead of produced by a centralized legislature. Thus law production is decentralized.
People who agree broadly on legal principles will accept similar laws for themselves, and tend to group into communities of legal agreement, or COLAs, which consists of the contiguous property boundaries of all parties to a COLA agreement. 
COLAs will allow in people who agree to live by the legal norms while in the boundaries of the COLA.
Police can ethically enforce laws that people have chosen for themselves by this means.
Thus, if you want to enter a certain COLA that has your favorite restaurant, you accept their entry agreement and agree to abide by those laws while in there. They won't be onerous laws because the COLA has to produce a reasonable entry-agreement if they expect to attract outside economic activity, as with restaurants.
Thus if people don't agree to a lawset they don't get into the COLA in the first place, and if they don't get in they cannot break the law. But if they do break the law, they have already agreed by contract, in advance, to how such violations will be resolved, e.g.: in a free-market court and via restitution, etc.
So again, those who don't agree to live by X laws will simply be pariahs thrust to the margins of society, unable to commit any crimes because they simply aren't allowed into polite society at all.
This is also why a free society doesn't really need prisons. All COLAs are opt-in, so if you prove yourself an untrustworthy criminal, then most COLAs will simply deny you entry and you will be forced to live with the other criminals, outside polite society, where force is much more a fact of life than living by law and reputation. It will be expensive and difficult to live there, and your security will largely be up to you, because few reputable security companies will want to deal with criminals who have been shown not to respect contracts.
So, again, I think you are incorrect.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:57:48
Absent governments, there is no such thing as inflation whatsoever. Well, I guess more mined gold could be found. And Bitcoin too has mining, but once that's over, there's no more to be found ever, and no one controls it, thus you can't inflate at all--and that's important.
Absent governments there is also no deflationary spiral, since these are caused BY previous instances of inflation causing unproductive investment bubbles in particular industries that later pop.
So, the quick answer is: no.
And this actually helps, not hurts, poorer countries, because they won't be like lambs among wolves, such as Soros who has crashed entire currencies because he could.
The best currency is one that government cannot manipulate at all. Therefore, bitcoin is a very good currency.

Doesn't need to be zero cost, just needs to be cheaper than alternatives, and it is, quite a bit cheaper.
As for buyers, if it's much cheaper for retailers, and retailers compete with each other for customers, the retailer's lower cost becomes lower prices for consumers, which thereby benefits everyone. It's indirect, but a very real effect.
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:23:14










And those effects are also marginal compared to the monetary effects, so you have no point. No currency ever hyperinflated because *people didn't want it anymore*. No, it fucking hyperinflates because the government is printing new currency by the billions.
















There are only two: supply and demand. The government controls only supply. Demand is always high for money and generally drops only if supply increases. Thus, demand can be effectively ignored, everyone always wants money--there's no such thing as having too much money.


And by far the major one.


You can do that, but it constitutes a wealth transfer from current holders of money (generally the poorer people) to the rich borrowers. So I would call anyone who supports such a system an exploiter and a bastard who deserves a beating.


Name a historical case of hyperinflation not caused by money printing.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:14:47


No exactly. Deflation is bad for government, and thus they spread FUD about it.
Deflation is fantastic for savers and wage earners.
But there is a type of deflation that can only be caused by government which is very bad--the deflationary spiral. But ironically it is caused by first inflating too much, then when the bubble pops that industry or sector deflates. But had the government not inflated in the first place it never would have happened.
So government cast fear about all deflation when the only bad kind of deflation is caused by government meddling.

The connection you're failing to make is that a fixed supply would be deflationary, ie: negative inflation.
If he can show that the market prefers a currency with a lower inflation rate, e.g.: the US dollar, over one that has a higher inflation rate, e.g.: the Venezuelan Bolivar, then by analogy he can show that a currency with a negative inflation rate, i.e.: bitcoin, will be preferred over any positive inflation rate currency.
He has to make this statement this way because no currency of fixed supply exists on the FOREX market, exactly so.
Why is it so hard for you to judge his argument on its merits instead of jumping to a pedantic point which he was obviously also aware?
Also, look into Thier's law. We have economic history that predates fiat.

Well of course there's force and coercion to defend property rights, contracts, and person.
The difference is that there's two types of coercion, ethical and unethical coercion, the one being defense, the other being aggression.
We would build a society that minimizes aggression, that ideally uses only defensive coercion. 
Current states by contrast **are themselves aggressors** because they seek to monopolize power in a given region, which a [polycentric law  society](does not.


You're really not understanding our position in the first place, thus this is no better than a strawman. Go read "Machinery of Freedom." The paradigm of an anarchic law society is too different to be communicated in all its nuance and objections in a few exchanges.

Systemic collapse always takes longer to occur than people think, then happens far more rapidly than people assume.
There's significant existential risk hovering over the US like the sword of Damocles right now. Specifically the dollar, which relies on the faith of central banks around the world not to crash, and if successive US presidents keep spending like Obama, or if successor Fed Chairmen keep printing like Bernanke, the world will leave the dollar behind as reserve currency.
This will, at the minimum, result in great inflation in the US and a generation or two of wealth will be lost, much like the recent crisis in Greece.
That will likely lead to political turmoil in the US for decades to come.

Well obviously I disagree. Friedman's work doesn't ignore elites and the effects surrounding them, such as the article claims, instead it turns each individual into an elite, effectively obviating power dynamics by equalizing them. His criticisms are valid in a political system here some people in society are able to force their will on others society via the mechanism of law, but invalid in a system that does not grant anyone the ability to force their will on others by law.
A change in the nature of the political system is ignored by your author. He instead assumes power-dynamics are objective rather than contingent on the nature of a political system. 
In any case I'm not interested in the argument. I will show you that the system is workable by building it and living it.

They removed restrictions in merchant agreements forcing merchants to charge the same price regardless if the customer paid cash or credit.
So, in the past everyone paid more for credit transactions because of those merchant agreements--the merchants just raised prices for everyone with the result that cash customers in part subsidized those paying with credit--an obvious win for the credit card companies.
The ruling now obviates that practice and they can charge for credit card purchases, and charge cash customers less.
This is positive for bitcoin because they can charge a true price for bitcoin too and credit should be left as the most expensive option.

Yes, asteroid-mining companies in planning have popped up in the last several years and are working on this in earnest.
Btw, we've had the tech to colonize space since the late 1980's, see Gerard's "The High Frontier."
That we could do it right now is a given. The missing ingredient is a profit-motive to do work in space, and asteroid mining may be one of the answers to that question.
But actually this ignore a more important factor. There's something more valuable than gold in space: water. Why? Because water separates into oxygen and hydrogen, which can be burned for completely-clean fuel, to produce again water. So, you separate them with solar energy, store them, breathe the oxygen, and burn the hydrogen when you need energy, and burn them again when you need clean water.
Also, water is a very effective radiation block. A good 6 foot deep wall of ice around a space-station, inside the walls naturally, is about all the radiation block you need to stop cosmic rays and the like.
Water is the gold of space, and there is water, water everywhere... in space. There's also tons of hydro-carbon rich comets and asteroids, another third of them, which means space is full *of oil*. And the last third are stony asteroids, which means they are rich in *aluminum* and oxygen, which could be separated for building materials. 
Comets are water-rich, we can begin harvesting them immediately. You harvest a comet via a gravity-tow, by parking a satellite next to it and maintain a crucial distance with ion thrusters. Over time the constant gravitic attraction between them alters the course of the comet/asteroid, causing it to become steerable to wherever you want it to go. Small changes in direction in the astronomical distances of space result in large vector changes.
We can do it all already. 
Beyond that there's Europa, a moon of Jupiter, that has as much water on its surface as the entire earth's oceans, and has a watery spout on it so powerful that it's *shooting water directly into orbit*! 
Which means we can send a ship there, gather ice already floating in orbit, and transport it anywhere in the solar system. Europa is the solar-systems number one *water-mine* and an absolute goldmine of value!
I'm pushing right now for [seasteading](but I think it will be a prelude to [spacesteading](Space colonization will come much faster than people realize. They think it's going to come sometime next century, if that. But we have SpaceX today. Asteroid mining and the resultant space colonization could be here in a decade.

The same thing that makes it hard to move off the dollar is what would make it hard for them to use anything but bitcoin.
The petrodollar exists as world reserve because there's so much buy-in worldwide on its use, and it has a great deal of economic confidence behind it, at least more than other currencies, and the political stability of the US is also higher than others.
But now it's being abused as the world reserve currency and people want off the ride.
Why would you then jump on a cryptocurrency created by someone with an interest in controlling it?
You wouldn't.
Saudi could make oilcoin, but I don't think they'd be able to get people to accept it broadly. They might get people to agree to trade bitcoin for oil coin, and then cash out of oil coin into bitcoin, but that would increase transaction fees, making their oil more expensive overall, meaning they'd have to charge less overall, and thus they'd be likely to abandon oilcoin.
It's a chicken and egg problem.
Besides, by the time bitcoin does actually get used as a petrodollar replacement for oil transactions, it's going to be huuuge in term of market cap.

Not so. You're paying someone explicitly to use force on another. That involves using force on another person as part of that transaction, making it an unethical transaction.
The reasoning that makes you guilty of a crime there is the same one that makes the getaway driver co-guilty of robbery, it's common cause.
By contrast, drug use and sales does not in any way involve the use of force on another.

Fees are optional. Fees are tips. And flat rate. The most important thing is that control over fees passes from the service provider to the customer. A bitcoin transaction fee is paid voluntarily, not set by the miners, not directly anyway.


You need to spend at the same moment you submit a block. Just having a block doesn't mean much. Furthermore if you withhold a block you've found to do a spend, you risk having the block invalidated by someone else finding a block and submitting right away.
And if you buy first and then try to doublespend with your block after, it's rejected.
It's only been done once successfully, and then as a test where no one lost any money, and that during the weird forking issue during an upgrade last year.

Neither does bitcoin in that sense, it will continue to be mined for the next 100+ years. But what is important is that no human being can control how much extra supply there. This is the functional meaning of fixed supply in a real-world context.
Fiat they can print hundreds of trillions tomorrow if they want to--it's supply is under human control.
When we say "fixed supply" we don't mean more can never arrive, only that its arrival schedule is itself fixed, by reality and the limits of physical existence in the case of gold, with the fixed algorithmic inflation schedule in the case of bitcoin.


Nonetheless, there is a finite amount of supply of gold in the world, ie: it is fixed. Finding it and refining it are not under human control.


So too is bitcoin inflationary in that sense, but what's important is that there are real constraints that no human being control. Bitcoin may be inflationary in terms of pure supply, but it's effectively deflationary if demand outstrips supply.
The same was and is true of gold, demand outstripped supply and it was deflationary.
You want to attack out functional definition with a pedantic supply definition.
Gold can be deflationary even though we kept finding more gold, as long as demand outstrips supply. The same is and has been true of bitcoin, despite a massive inflationary schedule in its early years it is clearly a deflationary currency because its valuation continues to rise historically.








No, think again yourself. If you compare gold/bitcoin vs fiat, you find that prices measured in gold/bitcoin continue to deflate, whereas prices in fiat continue to inflate. This is the sense that we were talking about that you're deliberately ignoring.
The only significant period of gold/silver inflation occurred when the Spanish stole tons of it from South America.

Of course. And those who want to ignore this facet are sad revisionists. 
Bitcoin is better than fiat in many ways. That's why we use it. This should not be surprising, since the flaws of fiat are designed to be exploited by the rich and powerful, that is, by governments, to benefit them at the expense of the masses.

"We are the government."
We are not. The government is a class of elected elites. The people who vote them in do not select them, they are selected as candidates and put forth by elites of the parties, and the system diligently protects a duopoly on political parties.
That's merely the biggest illusion.
You can take anything people say they in response to "Why do we need a government" and all of that is an illusion in their mind, since government is just a group of people in an organization, and what one group of people can do another group of people can do just the same.
The difference between a government doing a thing and another group of human beings doing the same thing is that the latter does not maintain a monopoly of force over society.
And there's nothing that we currently use government for that also requires a monopoly of violence to do.
Thus, we do not need government. Not for roads, not for courts, police, or law. All of that, including MONEY--currently another government monopoly--can be done privately. 
And bitcoin is already proving this out. But of course there was gold, a non-government money, long before fiat was monopolized by governments.
This question is bigger than some comment section. I suggest ["For a New Liberty" by Rothbard]( which you can download free.
Anything you want to list that people think they need government to do is an illusion, and thus a religion. Governments don't make roads, don't pay for welfare, don't do anything of its own accord--because government exists only in the minds of people as an organizing principle. It is not magic.

By the time bitcoin is what it promises to be, your Peruvian won't need to convert to local currency. That's what's driving both bitcoin adoption and movement out of state currencies. It's dramatically more efficient to transact in bitcoin only than to transfer out.
The question is how things get to that point? Largely by time, experience, adoption, and confidence.
I doubt any Peruvian would have any trouble accepting and holding bitcoin if it were already a major world currency, without feeling the need to convert to local currency, and if they did then likely any bank would do it the same way they do foreign currencies now.

I don't know if this is a serious question, but if you knew a bit about economics you'd know the answer. You seem to be suggesting that a molecular printer would obviate any need for trade, this isn't true. As long as there is trade you will need money, and trade isn't going anywhere any time soon. Our economy is trade dependent.
Even if everyone in the world had a molecular printer capable of printing anything, you would still need the inputs to that machine. The so-called "ink."
At the very least then, the world would devolve to mining, growing, and printing, with much of the in-betweens cut out, but then you'd still need files to print, so there'd arise a very large design economy, and you'd be buying designs from all over the place.

I like to think that this identification should tell us something about the value and therefore the price of bitcoin.
If bitcoin can save the world $200b per year, then it's market value should be a great deal higher than its current $9b.
So, we might think that price of bitcoin should be able to rise at least 20 times based on this info.
But we also have to realize that this is not a one time event, it's $200b *per year* so we might say it's worth actually a few multiples of that. Perhaps saying 200 times the current price, using a mere 10 years of savings, is actually more realistic.
During those 10 years, bitcoin saves its users over $2 trillion dollars! That correlates to rising standards of living for all of us using bitcoin, and also a wealth transfer away from banksters and to us.

The market did not decide this. It was forced on people by governments against their will. Stop saying this.

Bitcoin does not have the same features that caused the market to move to gold receipts over gold.

Not exactly. In this case you have a depiction of an involuntary act, an actual crime. The focus should be on helping the victims depicted, not merely punishing possession. It might be asked if criminalizing possession makes it easier or harder to find the victims and perpetrators. If decriminalization of CP-possession meant more of these bastards got caught and prosecuted and more victims saved, where do you fall on that question then?
I admit that's a thorny question, but there should be absolutely no such reservations about drug sales, which don't involve violating a 3rd party's rights at all.








Fine, but this has nothing to do with drugs, and in any case involves an instance of force, the abuse of the child itself, and thus is not analogous.


Of course, since that involves acting in concert with those forcing an exchange, the robbers.


Sure, but if it's illegal and unethical let's be clear that it's because there's someone being forced, being abused, in the equation. Without that there can be no justification for making anything illegal.
No victim, no crime.
Obviously CP has a victim!








I don't care whether it's illegal or not, I only care what's ethical. And if drug use is ethical, and it is, then the laws against its use and sale are unethical and must be abolished.


The law should be first ignored by the populace, then not enforced by the police, then repealed.

For an altcoin to beat bitcoin it has to do something bitcoin can't do.

That's a point, but he isn't just a high-strung artists. He's ideologically motivated, and that makes it less likely. Bitcoin by now must become for him a source of pride and identity, his *nom de guerre* is worldwide famous, and he keeps a secret larger than most have ever had in world history. He's not erratic, erratic people can't keep a secret this long, nor maintain the discipline needed for online security.
Similarly, he did come back to deny being Dorian Nakamoto, not, I think, because of his own sake, but to take the heat off of an innocent man being harassed by world media. He stuck his head out to help someone, and still remained anonymous despite people being on their guard this time.
I think the reason he left bitcoin development wasn't out of indifference, but because he knew they'd start actively ferreting out his identity, and even the best online security protocols for remaining anonymous don't work against sustained attack by government agents with unlimited resources and manpower.
In fact if you want to think about something frightening, the actual best play today for anyone who wants to destroy bitcoin may be to find Satoshi, force him to turn over his coins, and then flood the market with them for a sustained period--an outcome that could destroy faith in bitcoin and make it largely useless at a critical point in its young life.

You want to do a money order--predominantly hurting the poor--you're going to pay $1 for up to $500 sent.
Intra-bank transfers take 5 days because that's the legal window on how long you have to reverse the charges.

I'd be far more concerned if we actually knew who Satoshi was today, but we don't.
And that window in which those coins could make major damage to bitcoin is and has been rapidly closing. I would venture to say already that bitcoin is now a permanent feature of the world economy. If Satoshi's coins really flooded the market, there's a lot of us ready to buy cheap coins on the basis of our understanding of bitcoin's compelling value proposition as the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions, bar none.
That aspect does not change, even if Satoshi's coins were to arrive.
What could result instead is delaying bitcoin's higher valuation by perhaps two years, while the bitcoin-faithful sop up cheap coins, and the ultimate failure of such a strategy to actually destroy bitcoin in any real way. After all, such an event does not attack the security of the network and its premiere status as the world's most secure blockchain.

Indeed. If anything they've gotten stronger, with sidechains and mining power. But bitcoin's status as the lowest transaction cost currency has not changed.
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:45:01
True, a more appropriate value is the cost savings incurred using bitcoin over the alternative. That is a measure of bitcoin's usefulness over the status quo.
If we posit that bitcoin is roughly 5% cheaper than most remittance services (which is a conservative estimate), then bitcoin would be adding $30 billion a year to the global economy in efficiency gains.
The actual value of that however should be spanned over a number of years. 20 years is typically chosen for a valuation, which would come out to $600 billion, which happens to be the same number he came up with, not that I intended it that way.
So yeah, $40,000 / btc. Why not.
The really trick is that complete adoption won't be overnight.
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:01:00
Their acceptance arguments will one by one be destroyed until the last argument is "Oh yeah? Well wake me up when the US government accepts bitcoin for taxes instead of the dollar!"
And when that happens, after repudiation of the dollar, they will be the poorest people of all for being so pigheaded, and perhaps also the most regretful people of all for having known about bitcoin early and to have stubbornly set their hearts against it.
In retrospect, bitcoin's dominance will appear inevitable to everyone, a historical certainty. They will be left with little more than a story of what could have been. Like the 3rd investor in Apple who sold out for like $30,000 in the first year and could've been worth hundreds of billions right now.

Part 2:


He said, even as bitcoin integration and adoption continued to grow worldwide.
So at what point do you take a second look at your premises to figure out where you went wrong? When bitcoin hits $2,000? When it hits $20,000?










Bitcoin's compelling value proposition as the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions. The central fact you don't realize about bitcoin.




I completely agree. But you seem to be ignorant about its lowest transaction-cost nature. Given that blindness, your position is rational. It is however a wrong position. Read Surda's thesis or else stick to your bad premise, I don't really care. It's your life, bro.


Sure there's a difference, but it's still demand and supply determining the price. If more people are buying bitcoin on the exchanges than selling, the price goes up. Every time.


And in some cases they did and made gobs of money when a use for that tech was discovered. E.g.: Standard Oil, Carnegie, realized oil was going rise in demand with the invention of the automobile, and he was right. Before that, oil was considered a nuisance in the middle-east.


So do your homework and decide.


I see no reason why this should be the case however.
















I base it off supply and demand. Raise the price and supply will increase. The only place supply can come from with bitcoin is from savers. It's axiomatic.


Lol, at what point does that believe become untenable? If it was going to fail it should've failed long ago, and long before this price.
















Sure, but it's early days still. And payment processors are able to insulate companies from all volatility. Are you actually unaware of how that works?

Yeah they have the money to do all that, but it would still take years to implement, and it would still be rather centralized and thus not nearly as reliable as btc, and I sincerely doubt they would be able to avoid the temptation to control its issue themselves.
And it still wouldn't be a matter of plug and play with the world's existing bitcoin infrastructure. It might be at best an industry coin that everyone else ignores, btc being the standard of commerce elsewise, and then people would buy into and out of bitcoin.
At that point, oilcoin either stubbornly hangs on within that industry, ignore elsewhere, or else gets dropped itself.
You say it would be a good thing for oilcoin. WHY? How?
Unless they compromise the network thus reducing the chance of its uptake entirely, they cannot benefit from it at all. It's just an accounting coin.
Are they going to pre-mine it? Then OPEC won't adopt it. They don't want to give billions to Saudi in such a manner. How does Saudia benefit from oilcoin then?
If they benefit, the coin is doomed. If they don't benefit, they may as well have used bitcoin in the first place. 
It's damned if you don't, damned if you do for them. Both options drive the entire world back to bitcoin.
Are you and I ever going to use oilcoin? Of course not.

The cause of deflation is the primary determiner whether it's good or not.
Deflation is measured in prices. So if an industry had a price bubble and it suddenly pops causing "deflation" that's the deflaitonary-spiral that is so disruptive. However, believe it or not, that kind of deflation is caused by massive inflationary monetary policies that seek to keep interest rates low, encourage borrowing--otherwise known as 'easy money' policies.
Economies with bitcoin can't be manipulated in that fashion and thus you don't get deflationary bubble pops.
What you get with bitcoin is natural and good deflation, the kind caused by increasing demand for money and increasing wealth generally.
Deflation is ever and always a monetary phenomena. The fact that it's measured in prices is our main problem in interpreting it.

They could try, but who would do business with an organization that does things by force? They'd lose all their customers and be out of business. A business only succeeds by doing everything by agreement. Force means substituting your will over the will of another, which is the opposite of agreement, it is aggression. Rather than having a paying customer, you'd have a tort.


No, I'm saying that monopolies can exist only when businesses collude with the entity in society capable of forcing laws on the rest of us. If such an entity doesn't exist and people instead make laws for themselves, then no monopolies can exist.


What's needed is a new political equilibrium that prevents a legal monopoly from arising. There's no more powerful and wealthy monopoly in the history of the world than the US government organization.

Oh stop stalling. I will take your point seriously if it has merit.


All I care about is ending inflation as a product of money creation. The other potential causes of inflation pale in comparison and impact.


No need. This is right? It will be largely irrelevant, or else toothless when performed using a cryptocurrency.


Only if the population shrinks would non-monetary inflation happen, and I'm not concerned with that, we're not anywhere near the population of the world shrinking. Minor inflation that can theoretically happen as a result of population shrinkage isn't a concern to me--maybe 500 years from now that might happen. And it's not equivalent to institutional theft in any case.


Nope. A one world currency will make inflows irrelevant. Again, this is right? I assume you know something about bitcoin.


No. Bitcoin makes other currencies irrelevant.


an innately deflationary currency in the long-run.
End money creation and you end inflation as a monetary phenomena, which means at the very least that hyperinflation will never again happen.








The poor can't hedge against it as easily as the rich. Just because you can take out insurance against theft doesn't make it right to steal.
And it is stealing, it is the direct transfer of value from one group to another against their will. What else would you call it except stealing?
















This is the economic equivalent of saying that if women don't want to get raped they shouldn't wear revealing clothing :|
















Except of course the entire 19th century, during which the US grew economically and experienced decades of uninterrupted deflation, while using a deflationary gold standard.


Ceteris paribus, it would be true.


Fractional reserve banking is fraudulent.






You made a categorical statement: "Poor people can't save..." which is laughable in the first place. Of course they can save. Even if it's a couple dollars a month. But why would you in an inflationary economy which can only encourage high time preference spending habits. Perhaps poor people don't save not because they can't but because of the high time preference incentives created by an inflationary economy.


Bull. The only people who can't save are those with zero income. Which is no one. Regardless of all other contexts.










































I started working at age 15. You don't think someone could save $3,000 a year for 10 years? It would be hard, but it's doable, sure. It's not impossible, only improbable.
Also, the "poor" are disproportionately the young who income increases with age. Few stay poor in the West.


And what if their savings rate is actually 12% instead, like it could be in a deflationary economy which isn't stealing some 5-6% a year from them.
Then their doubling period is every 6 years instead of every ~10. Start at age 18 and you have to put away $37 a month to earn $1m by the time you hit 65, well within the means of any person, even the most poor in the US. You could save that much walking the streets for aluminum cans if you wanted.
Now tell me who profits from deflation.

Naturally I disagree. I suggest anyone interested look into Austrian economics, the group of economic theories that inspired bitcoin's design in the first place as a deflationary currency.
And btw, gold is a deflationary currency and ran the world economy for centuries.
Governments banned good because they could, and because they wanted to inflate and win votes by helping debtors and rich people.

No, 'cause that chargeback can be abused by a customer more easily than a business can disappear with your money.
You are right that it increases the trust required for a new company to get started, but that's a lot easier to mitigate on the company side.
For examples we can look at the various ASIC sellers. For much of 2013, there were ASIC suppliers and scams coming out of the woodwork. But people very quickly rooted out who seemed trustworthy, like KNC and Cointerra, and who was obviously a scam.
It's much easier for group knowledge to be passed along about a single business and their experience with them, than for a single entity--the business--to have to try to ferret out whether every single customer is trustworthy. See?
And as for actual risk with new companies, we have escrow for that, so that's mitigated that way.
The other factor is pricing. When a business has to deal with fraudulent payments and chargebacks, it raises prices for everyone. When customers take the risk, a foolishly-taken risk redounds solely on their heads. So once again, this situation is still more desirable than the reverse.

If you put away $100 this year and it is worth $98 next year, why would you ever save? Thus the poor simply spend.
It's not that a deflationary economy would create extra discretionary spending, but rather than it would actually reward them for saving rather than spending in the moment.
Since poverty is actually a function of high time preference, this incentivizes low time-preference behavior which would tend to help them exit poverty.

What made gold a good currency previously is what makes bitcoin a good currency now.
The market abandoned gold for various reasons, however bitcoin does not share the attributes with gold that caused it to be abandoned, namely bitcoin is not inordinately heavy, expensive to transport, difficult to prove is real gold, and to train cashiers to accept, etc. Bitcoin is actually better than gold on those measures.


Do you not know how fiat arose? People held gold in banks and vaults and the like, and because gold was inconvenient to transfer people began making scrip, receipts for gold ownership similar to bearer bonds.
Once this became accepted, governments stepped in and divorced the script from the asset it was supposed to represent, thus creating fiat.
The market never abandoned gold, governments forced fiat on people because they could. Only after script had gained widespread acceptance did government exploit that acceptance to create fiat.
Gold could still work well on a scrip basis in the same way that we trade fiat-bills now.
Bitcoin's revolution is that it can be transmitted digitally and *carry its values with it* rather than needing scrip or receipts that refer to an actual commodity.

And who would that be?
Ostensibly it would be borrowers who are hurt by deflation, except that can index their principle borrowed amount to deflation, ala the look-ahead mechanism I just talked about. So it's not borrowers. And it's not business-owners, who can do the same. So who is it?
There's no analogous direct way to profit from deflation like there is for inflation. Despite your claim here. Who is left holding the bag according to you???


No, there's no chance that a system that allows some in society to steal value from others can produce a superior outcome to one that doesn't allow the same thing.


If you believe that to be true, then we should definitely choose the system that doesn't allow exploitation of the poor by the rich via printing money.


Fine, let's choose the one that doesn't institute theft. Deflation.
















It's just a contract, it's not inherently a pure futures contract. In a society where one could expect about 2% deflation a year, there's hardly any risk to agreeing to it. And anything outside that range can be contractually created to void the contract, protecting both sides.
Any problem you can come up with can be handled by a forward-thinking contract.












Easy. Point out who profits from deflation. If you can't do it, then you're wrong.


I question whether you even know what deflation is if you put things this way. 


How? Come on, name it.
















It's not that they're the same thing, it's that inflation is a monetary phenomena. Inflation can come about through changes in supply and demand of money. Inflation happens either if demand for money decreases, or if supply of money increases. Large swings in inflation are almost always causes by changes in supply.
If the US government did not print more money each year, then the economy would be in a natural state of deflation, by a couple percentage points. 
The fact that we have some 2% inflation means the government is printing away all the natural deflation and a couple points on top of that, possibly to the tune of as much as 6% newly created money a year entering the economy, ***stealing value*** from all other dollar holders.




















You don't know what inflation is, and you are pro-inflation, that makes you already economically suspect. Are you perhaps employed by the government, or a university? Explain to me why YOU like inflation and think it positive.
















Lol. Poor people also spend far larger proportions of their income on luxuries than other economic groups. Some people have been known to spend 25% of their income on cigarettes. Investment vehicles are also out of their price range. But if they could gain value by putting a few dollars away per week or per day, that adds up over time. Most of the fortunes have been made by investing. Any average person can save a few million dollars by retirement if they begin investing young. So too can the poor.
To say "Poor people can't save..." is horrific.


I can in terms of their investment behavior. What's the minimum amount you'd need to have to open a stock account as an average trading desk? $5000? $500? Some poor don't even have $50.
You know what investment gets heavily marketed to the poor? CDs. And CDs don't even cover the inflation rate. After inflation, a CD produces less value than before the investment.


All I'm saying is that when you have an inflationary economy, saving in the form of discouraged. 
Obviously it would be better to encourage cash savings, then poor people would be incentivized to save, with the result that many would be able to escape poverty long term.
We save $100 this year if it's going to be worth $97 next year. You claim to have read Human Action but you don't even understand time preference?
















So fucking name who profits and how already!

Except that the opposite has been happening.
The arrival of ASICs recentralized mining to a degree never before seen--this is true. But is there another technological revolution of the kind seen with ASICs on the horizon? Nope. And the large miners of the past have seen their percent shares dropping ever since as new miners take up the task.
There's actually nothing about mining that makes it a so-called natural monopoly (what even is that, there's no such thing). Anyone who thinks they can compete on the basis of performance per watt can mine, and that is a hard limit everyone faces, not something that gives anyone a monopoly.

"Amidst the flux of expansion or contraction, the State always makes sure that it seizes and retains certain crucial 'command posts' of the economy and society. Among these command posts are a monopoly of violence, monopoly of the ultimate judicial power, the channels of communication and transportation (post office, roads, rivers, air routes), irrigated water in Oriental despotisms, and education—to mold the opinions of its future citizens. **In the modern economy, money is the critical command post.**" [~Rothbard](

It can happen precisely once, and that's all, and it's not that likely in the first place. To some degree, that risk is priced in.
But it can only happen in the worst case scenario if some rogue state finds Satoshi, beats him with a lead pipe until they get his coins, then rush to world markets to dump bitcoin at the lowest possible price in a bid to hurt the currency.
Is this scenario even likely?
Nope. If a state obtained his coin on the sly they'd be more likely to keep it for themselves, imo.
Would dumping all that coin necessarily destroy bitcoin, also no.

Do you assume that people aren't smart enough to figure out this might happen? Because it's only a problem if people are too dumb to realize this.
If people can actually look ahead at expected deflation levels, then they can bake into their current price the expected deflation cost of replacing their inventory.
Or they could do the much smarter thing and simply lock in prices ahead of time via contract so they don't have to worry about it.
There's a million possible ways to deal with deflation contractually and as a business-owner. However, deflation doesn't have any special interest groups that can profit from it. Inflation does.
This is why inflation is favored politically, because it is a source of profit for the government and those who receive the newly created money to spend before the price rises have hit the rest of the economy as a result of that money-creation.
Thus the poor end up with the money at the end of the day, after all prices have risen due to that money creation, and all the money the poor have now have decreased in value concomitantly.
Again, go learn some real economics, Austrian economics.
Inflation sucks and you've been sold a pack of lies if you think it's the best way to run an economy.
Deflation, by contrast, would encourage saving, and actually help the poor thereby, both encouraging them to save and making their saved money more valuable over time.
But again, there's no way for any government-connected group to profit at everyone else's expense in a system of deflation.

People said the same thing about the internet and email and a cellphones, etc., etc., etc. Just because bitcoin is a bit rough to use now doesn't mean people can't learn and get the hang of it, or that use can't be made easier and safer. Today's condition is not a permanent one.
















It is bad for consumers, because it results in higher costs of goods. Goods aren't just priced what they cost to make, they are also priced to cover the cost of doing business, including fraud, insurance costs due to fraud, and the like.
If bitcoin results in less overall fraud then prices can go down significantly. If ever merchant charged a few percent less because of using bitcoin you'd be surprised just how much more buying power that turns into for an entire society. It would be very, very significant.








Volatility is not inherent in bitcoin, but rather due to two things: pricing in dollars, and the youth and adoption state of the currency.
If bitcoin were your currency of account and entire economies were using it, it would be more stable than just about any currency known. Even gold lost 25% of its value this year, so it's not like you can claim volatility isn't an issue everywhere.
And there's one important fact: bitcoin can never hyperinflate. You can't say that about fiat, and that's a risk I never want to experience.


Unless they think bitcoin adoption inevitable, which means long-term deflation is also inevitable. Which has proved extremely smart so far.


Only until bitcoin becomes the unit of account and there's no more switching. But people like you don't seem to take that eventuality into account. Yet it's actually quite likely to happen.
It's like you're telling me email will never take off because if you want to show an email to someone without a computer you have to print it out so why not just send a letter then. LOL. Eventually everyone gets a computer and learns to use it. And that's a lot harder and a lot bigger adjustment than learning to use bitcoin.

No, it's not printing more money at all. You don't get it. It's division of existing money. It would be like if the dollar became too valuable and pennies weren't small enough so we started using eights of a penny like existed in Britain long ago.
The number of divisible units in one bitcoin is unlimited, but the value of each unit isn't.
If we only had one bitcoin to go off, it would have to be worth trillions, then each division could be billions, millions, etc., down the line as needed, all the way to dollar and cent equivalents. If that necessitated 10 or 12 decimals, we simply patch the code to 10-12 decimals, and this is already being planned for and known to be possible.

Those who do not believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin and the good it can do in the world vis a vis wresting control of currency from the hands of malicious politicians who use their control of fiat to enrich and empower themselves and their friends--those who are only in bitcoin to make some money or the like. These are the weak hands who can be easily chased out of the currency when things look bleak; they will sell their coins and be done with it. Because their heart is not in the same place as Satoshi's, they are not warmed by the same fire that lit Satoshi's passion for bitcoin. They are warmed by another fire, not one that sees bitcoin as a solution to some of the major problems of this present age. 
Perhaps a hundred years from now, it is not the people who just wanted to make some money off bitcoin that bitcoin will be remembered for, but rather the existential threat that bitcoin became to the existing monetary order, an order that exists mainly to leech wealth from the people of the world under the pretext of saving them from another monetary catastrophe.
Bitcoin is in one sense, a return to gold, but gold of the digital age; it is therefore an expression of libertarian political action, and a cutting edge attack on the power of the state as an existential entity to control people's lives by controlling their wealth.

K, so now you've got two people mining compared to bitcoin's thousands or more.
Anyone who values decentralization and the security that comes from it will look at this coin and say why should I mine when bitcoin already has this locked up.
Beyond that, it's vastly, vastly more likely that schemes like this *won't* let others mine, or if they do, they will retain control in some way over the creation of new coin so that they can themselves control the protocol and inflate (ie: A-shares vs B-shares schemes).
So the 'why wouldn't they' question is that they would lose a lot of the power and wealth gained by controlling a currency, which is why countries want to control currencies in the first place.
Look at Ecuador, they banned bitcoin and announced they were going to start their own cryptocurrency, look to them for an example of how it will go down every time another country or w/e announces this. It will be politically controlled by their country in one way or another, and even if you mine you won't be conferred significant control or power.
Ecuador has run their own currency into the ground so many times that their citizenry repudiated all further attempts at an Ecuadoran currency, so they defaulted to using dollars and other currencies, ones that the government couldn't control.
Do you think the Ecuadoran government has suddenly learned its lesson and will create a trust-free alt-coin that anyone can mine and they don't control? No, they'll make one and then pass a law saying you can't use bitcoin, you have to use Ecuador-coin and then they'll inflate Ecuador-coin and destroy their economy again.
What's more, if all the other alt-coins can compete with bitcoin what makes you think a country-sponsored one could? Either they control it and force people to use it, in which case it will only be used there in that country, or else they free it like any alt-coin and it dies the death of being ignored like all the others.
Lots of people don't understand that what has kept bitcoin pre-eminent among all the alt-coins is its strictly limited currency (21 million), it's broad-base of mining which no one else can touch, the network effect--by which the more people that buy into the system the more valuable it is to new entrants to the system, and path dependence--whereby those who have chosen one coin find it decreasingly profitable to switch, as their infrastructure, knowledge, and investment build into that coin.
These trends feed on themselves, growing in harmony, and leave altcoins in the dust. They're simply not needed.
I'd love to see someone try what you're saying, just so we could watch it fail and bring experience to the theory of it.








Then what's the point of pegging it to the dollar?


Wow, the problem here is that the political elites of the US will not accept a currency they can't inflate. You seem to be unfamiliar with the shit-storm stirred up in official circles by the mere suggestion that inflation is bad.

How do you integrate the arrival of ASICs into this theory? They were introduced and corresponded with a massive price increase all the way up to now.
And they are far, far more efficient than the mining machines they replaced.
If Gox was propping up the price then, where is Gox now? The price should be sub $100 now if your theory is correct.
The equation is not merely how efficient mining machines are. 
I have no doubt the year-long price bleed is early adopters siphoning off wealth while trying to preserve their capital value, ie: not dumping.
There is an end to that road, and its outcome should be price increases. When btc becomes a unit of account for most people, there will be no reason to cash out and instead of a price bleed we'll face a price climb.

Sell or don't buy-in then. Not hurting you.


Here's what you're missing: bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced-transactions. Tulips, etc., never had that.


Its utility as the lowest transaction-cost currency is actually far more important than the likelihood of short-term value gains. If every transaction in the world is about 3% more efficient, that means rapid wealth gains for the entire world. Or at least those using bitcoin.
The bitcoin using world will rapidly begin gaining wealth over the fiat-users in time. We're not quite there because the bitcoin-purchase loop hasn't been closed, not quite enough people being paid in bitcoin and buying in bitcoin totally.


We shall see, shan't we.

You could keep mining, yes. It would be very unlikely to maintain any serious worth however, as the major exchanges would move to the longer chain, and demand would drop off significantly.
Also, if anyone did setup an exchange for it, lots of people like all of us still have coins on that old chain and could actually cash out to obtain some value. And they would likely do so to a large degree.

Sure. I even started to voice my disagreement.


As if democratic were a good thing. All democracies are a system of the rationalization of violence against dissenters.
I am a voluntarist; I believe all human interaction should be voluntary, and all forced interaction is unethical and evil.
Democracy is the world's leading rationalization of forced interaction. Every time the "majority" decides something they feel it is therefore perfectly acceptable to force their will on the minority. I think that is extremely bad and wrong and that people should not be supporting such an obviously evil system.


Yes, however there is no voting system which stop the majority from forcing their will on the minority. That's the central flaw in democracy, not which method of vote counting you use.


Yes, exactly, and democracy can never, NEVER avoid this problem as long as you have *someone in society who is able to force laws on everyone else in society*.
Which is why the solution to the problem of democracy is to [abandon democracy](and institute a [voluntarist political system](&gt; You are also actively engaged in many human right abuses such as Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes, mass surveillance, starting wars for no reason (Iraq), ... the list goes on an on. The USA of today is nothing like what it was in its prime. 
I am not engaging in anything. I am not the same as the group of people who run my government. I did not vote for them. I am not responsible for their actions. They do not control me. No US citizen was given a change to vote on whether to got or war or not.
Face the truth: democracy is the wool that's pulled over your eyes today. It is the lie that makes tyranny acceptable.

You won't immediately. Bitcoin only isn't quantum safe, right now, if you re-use an address. If you do not re-use, which is the default behavior of bitcoin, then there is no quantum risk currently.
Except for coins mined in the first two years of bitcoin's existence. Those are all quantum-vulnerable, and probably the first that will be stolen by quantum-attack unless Satoshi first moves them, which is unlikely.
There's an awfully big payday for someone who can get a successful quantum attack going, they can literally make a billion dollars on day one and no one to stop them.

We don't need a had fork to raise the blocksize if the devs simply agree to do it now.
Blocks are full now, what is this 'planning'? You don't need to hold off on 2mb to implement segwit.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:47:27


That's what a hardfork means.


If the hardfork goes through, changing PoW will be the only realistic way to avoid that.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:56:27


But of course it isn't that at all. Raising the block-limit is in everyone's interest, with only a few core devs blocking it for mysterious reasons that make no sense.
Meanwhile, raising the 21m limit is in no one's interest.
Ignore incentive at your peril.
The idea is that which is in favor of bitcoin holders and investors will get done, and that which isn't will likely never happen. Increasing the 21m is in no one's interest.
Just look at what happened to Dogecoin when they changed that limit to see why.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:18:29
Once. Then what happens when we need 4mb. There is no segwit 2.0 that makes a 1mb block the equivalent of 4mb.

Yay, cheap coins.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:58:10
Segwit only works once. There will be no segwit  that makes things better again. Segwit is a dead-end.
Those in charge of the bitcoin repository refuse to allow a 2mb soft-fork, so a 2mb hard fork is the only option.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:02:50


Immaterial, the people who control bitcoin core won't let a soft-fork 2mb happen. So that's not an option on the table.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:31:16


But it does require a block-increase, which I do not trust the Core devs to implement as needed, since they are purposefully holding off on doing it right now so they can "create a business model" for Blockstream profitability.




I don't have a problem with Segwit, it's fine, but it's not a forever solution without a new blocksize solution like automatic increases.

You don't need a PhD in history to know the various failed socialist experiments world wide in the 20th century alone, much less going back to the less dramatic failures of the Amana and Oneida American colonies and Josiah Warren's early conceptions and failures.

I still blame those who have allowed this situation to fester and become a crisis when it never had to be. They could've hardforked to 2mb months ago and then had tons of time for implementing segwit. [What is the danger of a hardfork?](
It has to happen anyway, and even core plans to hardfork to 2mb+ "at some point." They should've done it last year well before the halvening was coming, which will cause some chaos on its own.






We already have nearly 75% of miners supporting classic, which means a hardfork of Core would have had near immediate broad support from miners and little to no risk of a split-chain.

Again, assumes he's alive and capable.
He may not want to risk moving the coins for some reason right now, possibly due to the risk of people finding out who he is thereby. Which is admittedly low.

Segwit only works once, and those in charge of the bitcoin repository will refuse to allow the blocksize to rise later when it's needed.
Segwit can still happen, but we need 2mb now, and we need to get rid of those controlling the current bitcoin repository whom are blocking 2mb, which is also supported by just about everyone, except those entwined with Blockstream.


No, raising the blocksize can be done in a moment, and should be. Segwit requires everyone to rewrite wallet software. That will take months more. They won't let the sensible thing happen, which is to raise the blocksize to 2mb now, then work on segwit while you're not under the gun, then continue raising the blocksize later as needed. They are deadset against the reasonable, sensible thing.

A soft-fork to 2mb is completely reasonable. Since those in power won't let this happen, hard fork bitcoin to 2mb and let's route around those who think they can control the entire bitcoin ecosystem in their own favor.

I'm sure a few diehards will keep running it, but for all intents and purposes it would be dead at that point, yes. For the same reason that no alt-coin has been able to challenge bitcoin's main blockchain, the network effect and path dependence. The differences between core and the new one at that point are also so minor, why wouldn't people switch. It is only the stubbornness of those who refuse to go to 2mb that has caused this situation.








It's completely unnecessary. They can operate in parallel without interference.








If Classic wins, core will be killed already.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:03:12

That is not a refutation. Blockstream's proposal creates a conflict of interest. In closed-door sessions of the Bitcoin foundation via logs that we have had released by insiders, they spoke of "creating a business model" for miners and blockstream by forcing people onto BS systems and away from direct contact with bitcoin, raising the price of a bitcoin transaction to as much as $10, so that people would use BS-like systems as their primary.
I do not trust their intentions therefore.

Nope. It would take bitcoin's code out of the hands of people who are advocating a "1mb forever" position and put it into the hands of those who are fine with continual blocksize increases in the future as needed. You are completely wrong here.
















That's fine, so do you want a repeat of this blocksize crisis in 1-2 years by leaving it in the hands of "1mb forever + segwit" people, or shall we render this problem moot by removing commit power from those people.
Obviously the latter decision is wiser.
















Once. It works once. What happens when we need 2mb+ blocksize? They will keep blocking so they can turn bitcoin into a settlement layer and promote Blockstream.

And more to the point, what is the source of their obstinacy on this point? Absent an obvious cause, we must question whether their employment by Blockstream is causing them to serve two masters, bitcoin and Blockstream, and it appears they've become more loyal to the latter than the former.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:55:18

I am looking forward to using it. I'd like to sell things on it like an Ebay replacement.

I will be selling pretty normal, boring things, but hey, that's how things get started :)
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:15:43
What risks? 
You realize Segwit forces all other wallet and 3rd party bitcoin software to hardfork? What risks are associated with that? People are going to have problems there. We might see significant drop-off of wallets for those that aren't maintained. Segwit could be far, far more disruptive to the bitcoin ecosystem than a single bitcoin hardfork to 2mb and up. Plus, segwit only works once, there will need to be future raises of the blocksize somehow anyway.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:02:48

But you should not be doing this by **sabotaging** its use directly, and that's where the problem has come in.    
Stop blocking the progress of larger blocks. Larger blocks do not threaten in any way the ability to create additional layers of operability.

@_date: 2016-01-15 22:09:32
I understand that now, thanks to you and others. However, I believe the current Core devs want to never increase the blocksize again or at least keep it chronically full, and thus segwit may give some breathing room, but would be a dead-end if they veto all future blocksize increases when needed, or at least keep the blocksize chronically overloaded. Even 2mb or 4mb would be of no use to us if blocks are chronically full when those get rolled out, even with segwit.

No, I'm asking for the blocksize debate to end with some future scheme that will automatically adjust the blocksize. But right now we need 2mb now.
Core is proposing to increase the blocksize only effectively, not literally, through segwit. I suspect they intend never to increase the blocksize again thus forcing people onto Blockstream and associated services.
It's not like Lukejr hasn't openly said he thinks we may actually need smaller blocksizes than 1mb. And you're calling me out of touch.
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:25:22
They could fork it to adjust the difficulty in this worst-case scenario. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:47:14
That will happen on its own as adoption continues. Don't remove bitcoin's great advantage: lower transaction costs, to artificially create a fee market, that would be exactly what the governments of the world would want, as that would slow down bitcoin adoption.

This sums up my position.
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:50:38

They change a few lines of code. It's not hard. Bitcoin's old limit was 35mb, that's known and tested.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:05:45
My impression of their intention is 1mb forever. They can only disprove this by agreeing to a 2mb softfork.
Why would they oppose an immediate 2mb softfork if they claim to support one as well? Actions speak louder than words. And being in the pay of Blockstream makes their intentions all the more obvious. They have even said they plan to make bitcoin a settlement layer and create a business-model for blockstream.
This is no lie.
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:07:21
All I care about is getting bigger blocksizes so bitcoin can grow. All Core has done has block that. You cannot deny those facts.
The why is immaterial.
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:32:04


You're not understanding me. Segwit may be soft-forked into bitcoin, but everyone who has built open-source bitcoin wallets will be forced to HARD FORK their bitcoin-wallet software to make them compatible with segwit. Do you get it?

Let's say that Edward Snowden is being raided by SWAT, and in his last moments of freedom, he sends his bitcoin where he knows it will be safe.
Moments later the government has his computer and there's no password on his send-button (or they've already obtained that by other nefarious means). 
**Can the government recover his bitcoin by using his computer to send an RBF transaction to take back the bitcoin transaction?**
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:44:33


And all ASIC miners will then switch to Classic, preventing OP's scenario 2 from happening.


All of us will have coin on Core after the fork, and if they try to setup an exchange, a lot of people will sell to buy more actual long-chain mainstream bitcoin (ie: Classic-chain). Corecoin will be devastated.

Good luck with that. Maybe you guys should remove the 21 million cap while you're at it.
If you think the broad ecosystem doesn't have a problem with core devs holding the entire bitcoin ecosystem hostage at 1mb, you've got a surprise coming to you. There will not be a rally around the abandoned devs.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:08:18


They want to make it non-optional. Full-RBF would force bitcoin into a settlement layer because merchants wouldn't accept RBF at all, meaning that Blockstream would be a necessity. It's obviously something that makes the BS people salivate at the thought.

It's pricing in the ETF. 
If the ETF is denied, then assured correction of a couple hundreds dollars will likely ensue.
If the ETF pulls it off, the price will rise even more, and stably so, due to new demand. The ETF is a demand gate, behind the gate is something like $300 million that will flow into bitcoin soon after the gate is opened, and more behind it in the years to come.
If the gate gets bricked off, then no extra demand.

It makes any blocksize more efficient, but it does so once.
Many people have said something to the effect of 'segwit is equivalent to 2mb blocksize' and to some degree that's true (some say more like 1.7 mb), but that does not help us much after the blocksize demand is 1.7mb and greater. That is, segwit does not solve the blocksize problem, it just delays it a bit.
That's what I mean by dead-end, you get some road, but there's an ultimate limit.
We must raise the blocksize continually over time. Segwit does not render that necessity void.
@_date: 2016-01-20 08:07:59

This is true, but there is also the network effect of the ecosystem built on the longest chain. Once Core changes their PoW and the price tanks, it's essentially finished. The Core devs are not irreplaceable if they decide to rage quit. They created this situation anyway, why would you want tyrants controlling bitcoin? This will be only the beginning if they're left in charge if they can be this obstinate over something as non-controversial as bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:42:05


@_date: 2017-03-07 00:12:25


Doubtful. All altcoins face the same problem going up against bitcoin--differentiate or die.
A split segwit-coin could go on to form the LN, then what?
Meanwhile if the BU chain forks blocksize to 32 mb / no-limit, clears up its backlog for the next years, turns down blockfees to pennies again, and also implements LN, where does that leave segwit-coin? A more expensive transaction coin, with a backlog of transactions, and less capacity. That doesn't compare favorably.
The core fee-market they want to force on bitcoin requires them to be the main-chain, it cannot be pulled off otherwise.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:02:15
Oh yeah, wanting a larger blocksize is "lies and FUD." Between us, you are the only one who might be being paid.


I'm not against segwit. I am against "only segwit." Segwit does not solve all future blocksize problems. Only getting away from the existing developers in control of the code repository does that.
@_date: 2017-03-30 23:17:39


Actually they do accomplish that; you're only advocating disutilities to ordinary people by attacking the libertarian motivations of bitcoin, making bitcoin LESS suited to more people. 
The only people who stand to gain from a non-libertarian direction for bitcoin is the state itself, which will regain the control that bitcoin sought to wrest from its grip, control used to harm the interest of most people. 
People like you are traitors to that original vision bitcoin was built on, of a world where governments did not use their control of currency to steal from the wider population, and Satoshi would be ashamed of you.
A bitcoin moving away from that vision is one that will be supplanted in time by a cryptocurrency version true to that vision.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:54:09

If lightning recentralizes transactions and removes trustless transactions, then it may get used for some things, but this will create space for a new coin to enter, because there is real demand for a currency that can route around government meddling in money-supply.
And if you think governments are going to take bitcoin and allow things like the 21 million cap to stand, that they aren't going to inflate, etc., that's not how it's going to happen. Governments must inflate.
You think you can boost bitcoin by making it palatable to governments--you're more likely to kill it that way.

That makes no sense. Here we've spent months trying to get a non-controversial and necessary change through, one that Core devs admit they must also do at some future point. The only controversy is whether the blocksize should be raised before segwit or after.
That is not the same as changing some core attribute of bitcoin to make its mission entirely different, like say is they tried to make RBF non-optional.

After that, we can serve the datastream of posts and comments in p2p fashion that is uncensorable. Lots of proposals for how to do this exist, such as using I2P or Bitmessage-type protocols.
My own contribution was to figure out how to do [decentralized-moderation]( which I call competitive moderation. It allows readers to choose their own moderator, rather than locking it down by sub.

Yes, but not on the market. You can buy from miners directly with coin that never sees a marketplace, or from long-term holders looking to sell.

No, when it costs twice as most to generate the same amount of bitcoin, then miners will care. Then things start to happen. If the price rises prior to the halvening and people pile on new mining power, some of that may disappear after the halvening, but not all of it.

You'd be right, if bitcoin was a centuries old asset. Volatility is due to its newness, not its qualities. If you're already sure of its qualities, you can consider very safe. Which is why many of us have been holding for years, and it has paid off nicely thus far.

Almost assuredly, and partly at least because of the way our political system is setup. Each president is only in office 4-8 years, and has that amount of time to control things. The incentive is to inflate as much as possible because the effects of that inflation won't likely hit until you're out of office.
Without an incentive not to inflate, the entire world has simply been inflating.
This seems to work as long as they can all inflate together and at about the same rate, invisibly leeching wealth from all holders of currency yet their exchange rates wouldn't change very much, making it fairly invisible.
And the US has bared its teeth at nations that broke the mold and either inflated more or less, like China has doen to gain trade advantages.
This works situation fine until the point that there is a non-inflationary currency to escape into.
Bitcoin can become that release valve once it garners enough history to be considered hardy and permanent.
At that point, with people increasingly rushing to escape fiat, the fiat holders must print much more than they did before to extract the same amount of value. This is what leads to hyperinflation, when the powers that be stop caring and just want more.

This is completely correct. It also asked how global elites can try to manipulate the market by buying OTC and selling on exchanges to lower the price.
But as the supply of new bitcoin diminishes, this strategy becomes less and less viable.
Long term, it will fall completely as the breadth of demand increases, and supply diminishes, and the price rises.
We still live in interesting times.

Only for those with a cognitive bias to ascribe value to physical objects. People like this are generally pre-internet people. The generation coming will not be like this at all, and bitcoin's virtuality has advantages that gold cannot match, such as the ability to be sent through electric lines.
Gold has a looming risk too, asteroids in space--which we are on the brink of mining--hold millions of tons of gold or more. Gold is not nearly as rare in the wider solar system as it is on earth. The closer we get to mining space-gold, the more gold's price will drop in response.
Meanwhile, bitcoin is rare univers-wide.
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:13:33
In the sense that bitcoin's issue is limited, and no other fiat currency can make the same promise--yes it is.

Definitely not. Bitcoin is informed with libertarian monetary theory and if successful would result in wresting control of money out of the hands of central-banks, which is not what any government wants, due to the power and wealth that control gives them.
If this were in any way true, it would have to be a rogue government group.

Well you can, but because no one thinks it's a very good idea, you won't get majority hash-power and your chain will therefore never become the longest chain, and therefore won't become bitcoin.

In the theory of money, this isn't quite true.
Money takes its value from several uses at once. One of these is exchange value, and one of them is value-store value.
It's possible for a thing to have high value-store value without being very useful for exchange. Gold is the best current example. No one wants to transact in gold daily, and many other metals are traded far more widely and more often than gold, but they don't have the same qualities that gold does that make it a good thing to store value in, namely that gold does not degrade over time like iron and other metals. It cannot be destroyed regardless of storage conditions, which isn't even true of silver which tarnishes and oxidizes.
Even if everyone hoarded bitcoin and didn't buy anything, there would still be others wanting to store value in it also because of its great qualities for storing value. It too, like gold, does not degrade over time, etc.
You can have an entire market just in value store, much as gold is today.
The actual situation is more complicated than people like you tend to assume.

This dude predicted 1,000 in 2018, back in 2015, he's a bit behind now:
There are a lot of bullish indicators, new stupid things several governments are doing with money, and Trump might make things worse too.
My linear projection is somewhere around $1900 by 2018.
If however, some currencies implode, like the EU, or another couple debt crises and bank failures occur, and Indians/Chinese lose faith in gov money, etc., things could go exponential.
So, I'll give a range. Between $1500 and say $5,000 in 2017, where $1500 is an uneventful year, and $5,000 means all kinds of currency mishaps occur and also that we resolve the block size scaling debate.

The only DS it wouldn't protect you against is the type of DS where someone is colluding with a miner to include a DS in their next block and not include your transaction.
A normal DS attempt, without miner collusion, must be broadcast at almost the same moment as the original transaction if it is to have any chance of beating the original spend into the next block.

An old economic puzzle was to figure out why bread was cheap and diamonds were expensive when bread was needed to live and diamonds were not.
The question of why and how people value things is fundamental to economics, and getting the answer wrong has had dramatic consequences.
Marx's incorrect labor theory of value kicked off the entire Marxist movement that killed tens of millions. All because of bad value theory.
Bitcoin has value because people value money and bitcoin is a good money, has qualities that allow it to serve as a good money.
Gold was a good money in comparison to other commodities too, that's why it was used as currency rather than chalk or iron.

The one major data point we have is *the last halvening*, when the price went from ~$12 to $233 something and up from there later.
New bitcoin creation will be half what it was previously. To figure out the effect look at the incentive on miners under this scenario.
Suddenly they won't sell any bitcoin they mine, because they'd lose money doing. Supply shock.
What's more, miners must figure out a way to pay their expenses somehow, eventually, so when the price of mining is higher than the price of bitcoin, I've heard that miners don't sell, *they buy*. That way when the price inevitably rises they can make back their current losses at least somewhat.
The result is massive supply shock and a quick upward-shooting price. It's not just 3600 new bitcoin a day disappearing from the market, it's virtually *all of it*.
Combine that with speculation that price will rise, resulting in even fewer people selling, and you have one interesting scenario.

And surely some of those against XT are opposing it for this very reason, because they don't want an independent bitcoin as a currency that anyone can use, they want to monetize access to the bitcoin blockchain with themselves as the gatekeepers, and it's disgusting.

No, it's not all you need. This is a popular economic fallacy. Productivity is also important.
A cheap work-force is fine, but it's cheap because it *doesn't produce as much* as a better paid work force. You know this because of the very fact that they're better paid.
When you look at productivity, an American worker may produce as much as 10 times more than a Chinese worker, per capita. That productivity figure explains the differences in yearly earnings between them, and puts them largely on par on the world economic stage in terms of productivity per dollar of income. 








Some industries are more quality-conscious than others. This isn't true everywhere however.








Good, comparative advantage should mean lots of jobs get sent overseas so Americans can do the more productive jobs that we have a comparative advantage.
Here's one example. The Mexicans decided to get into the Apple business. We know agriculture, they reasoned, and we have cheap labor. Surely we can produce cheaper apples than Washington with their $14/hour average labor costs.
They tried it and they failed. Because Washington has a comparative advantage in apple production that Mexico could not compete with. Mexico was unable to produce an apple cheaper than Washington.








Will just make us more productive.

These sorts of schemes miss the deeper points of monetary theory. Gold isn't some magical money. It just happens to have the qualities that make for a good money.
Bitcoin happens to have the exact same qualities, and a few more on top of it that gold can't match.
Thus, we should expect bitcoin's sun to rise as gold's moon diminishes.
*Things really have changed, gold's hegemony has been disrupted forever.*
Trying to mix blockchain with gold betrays a confused and uninformed mindset, the kind of plan that sounds good to someone with a shallow understanding of the concepts involved.
Bitcoin's great advantage is low-trust transactions. The minute you try to combine blockchain with a physical good like gold you run into trust issues. Now you have to audit gold reserves. How often? Who audits the auditors? How can you mark a single piece of gold indelibly so that it can be tracked permanently on the blockchain--you cannot, only digital items can this be done with. 
Etc., etc. 
Forget about gold, it served its purpose for a long time, and will continue on for a time, but we've discovered the first real money in the universe, something much closer to the platonic-form of money, and therefore more elemental, more valuable, more desirable.

For one thing get out of the market and into hard assets (yes including bitcoin). This is what the wealthy do to hedge, with typical investments being land, art, and precious metals, and secondarily hard assets of any kind, anything likely to hold some value.
Try to insulate yourself from currency swings. It used to be people bought the dollar to do that, today the dollar itself may be at risk. Where will people hide then.
If the crisis is bad enough, the world elites may use the crisis to push one of their agenda items, perhaps pushing the Amero as some have long talked about. History has shown that governments won't give a damn about setting the exchange between new and old to something compensatory. It just becomes another form of wealth transfer.

The companies exploring alt-coins in this manner are just 3 years behind the curve, bitcoin too had its altcoin craze and that has now largely passed.

Actually it can compete with them, because those networks do have a network effect, but it's balanced out by those who control those networks exploiting those who use them.

Also known as the network effect. The more users and developers bitcoin has, the more valuable it becomes for everyone, the more incentive there is for newcomers to buy into this cryptocurrency rather than another, and at this point there's massive incentive.
Critics have said, can't you just fork bitcoin and start a shitcoin in 5 minutes? Yes, you can, but you can't copy-paste developers and users and merchants.

Cyprus, Greece, Italy, etc., are high risk banking sectors due to their sovereign situation. There's a risk of AML fines for people using their foreign banks to squirrel money out for others. I imagine it's tied to KYC/AML things like that more than anything, creating increased risk. And governments are coming down exceptionally hard on minor infractions, such that it's just not worth it for small accounts. Creating an account limit like this does two things, limit the accounts to the cherry ones they can make a decent profit on, and significantly reduce their oversight numbers to look after. They might experience a 90% drop in accounts to oversee, but the profitability of them will go up.
They're happy to pass those small accounts off to someone else. Someone else might be bitcoin, in which case it becomes a class case of disruption from below, from the least profitable sector upwards.

Because they can make a profit. Any homegrown solution is inferior and more expensive. That turns into a compelling use case. Treat bitcoin like an API, like Amazon Web Services, so large that you can expect it's world-class reliable.








They're also looking for things like interbank settlement, property transfer. You don't need non-reversibility in that situation, gigantic banks aren't going to suddenly disappear. Banks could perhaps off digital escrow and arbitration services in the near future, but they've begun to treat the blockchain infrastructure as an empty space to rush into, with the first winners grabbing the spoils. Drudgereport, for instance, took an early lead and never looked back. Who will become the trusted name in blockchain-escrow or the like. It's potentially a gold rush of services they can get into, even if they can't churn in the ways they do in other places.








Bullies don't always get their way. Decentralized applications, such as bitcoin, have proven exceptionally difficult for governments of any kind, at any level, to sanction and block.








But I'm arguing that they will treat the blockchain like TCP-IP, no one OWNS TCP/IP, they own the services the websites *made possible* by TCP/IP.








No one's suggesting otherwise, but about an hour's worth of study will show you why this is hardly an issue. Even in the worse case scenario, the devs could roll the blockchain back to pre-crisis.








This is domain knowledge. The best in the world are the people who literally invented the system, who wrote the code as it currently exists and have spent years hacking on it, and those are the people already working on bitcoin. 
I'm sure there's wizard coders out there still, but they'd have to get up to speed on cryptocurrency. You're not going to hire away the current wizards already invested in bitcoin's ecosystem. Charlie Shrem was never going to go work on Paycoin.

Iirc, SpaceX has it down to about $1,000 / lb now. NASA is still some $10k / lb.


The first asteroids captured will be near-earth asteroids, not the asteroid belt. These aren't as far away as you think. In fact they're already there waiting for us a L4 and L5, where it's theorized and likely that asteroids have already been captured there and have zero momentum relative to earth, just waiting to be harvest. It takes less energy to get to L4/L5 than to get to Mars, much less the asteroid belts.








Not mostly gold, no, but 1/3 of all asteroids are metals-rich asteroids, and the amount of gold on them may be small on a percentage basis, but still far more than has been mined in earth's history thereby.


You need a solar-powered furnace and a means to break-up the asteroid.


Solar-powered furnace. 


In space, water is fuel. Most comets, possibly some asteroids, and places like Io are full of water. Use sunlight to break water into gases, then reburn them for fuel, etc.


The gold is actually free, compared to the real target of the iron and nickel on each asteroid, of which there's about $10 trillion worth per asteroid.
If we can mine one asteroid, we can mine another, and the first one will be the most expensive. But with a figure like $10 trillion floating around, how much investment money could you rationalize putting into such a projects.
Today, single companies have been able to raise literally billions of dollars to perform projects, like building a chip-fab, average cost is around $2 billion.
Could you build and lift into orbit a solar-powered furnace for $2 billion or about that? I'm sure it could be done for less than $10 billion. And you've still got a whole lot of room on that $10 trillion figure.

But that analogy doesn't work, does it. The government is not an unknown "someone" it's a specific entity. On the basis of my statement, I do not support that kind of moral reasoning.
Let me put it this way: I believe taxation is theft. So if the government steals say $20k in taxes from X this year, I would be fine if X stole $20k worth of electricity from the *government* electrical provider. Because that would be justice.
In your scenario where A steals from X, therefore X claims he should be able to steal from B, C, or D--that is not just at all. X must direct his recompensatory-"theft" at A, and A alone for justice to prevail.

Right, I don't think those aspects would ever end--we will always be building capital, always need money to exchange, etc.
What the left wants to see is an end to "wage slavery," the need to work a 9-5. That may indeed come about.
At that point it will be the ambitious who keep working even though they don't need to, and all progress will revolve around them, while the left hippies smoke pipe, have children, and listen to music, I guess.
The decadence of the latter will eventually cause them to self-destruct, and life will continue with the active and vital elements moving forward, still accumulating capital, exploring the galaxy, and building--always building.

Again, because you don't understand the full extent of modern reliance on encryption. If you did, you'd know that, for instance Airbus, has an encrypted command which can shut down all pilot input and autopilot the plane to a safe landing, created as an anti-terrorist measure. But if you can crack that encryption, you can simply turn on the autopilot and command it to autopilot into whatever building you choose, or just cut the engines right then and there, and the pilots are locked out.

Nah, the rejoinder that cash can do the same thing only easier is more devastating to their cause. Besides, the internet did the same thing, came out of nowhere and has smashed their monopolies on media, and yet they're unable to reign it in now. TPTB tried to defeat the encryption and have tried to centralize it, but crypto got out in a way they didn't plan and the genie can't be put back in the bottle, and similarly they can't balkanize their internets, their people demand world access. China's firewall won't last and is also easily circumvented even there, for instance.
Libertarian outcomes have the advantage because they rely on people pursuing that which is in their self-interest. There's always far more people than government agents.
They were sure there was nothing they couldn't control, but bitcoin is something new in money, decentralized money, and as with the internet and other similar things like file sharing, decentralized applications have proven relatively invulnerable to state control.
When there is no center for the state to attack, pressure, regulate, and control, the state has floundered in how to respond to such things. Things like the Liberty Dollar got away for awhile, years even, so too with Silk Road, but they came down hard on those centers. But bitcoin has no center.
And they will be afraid to take legislative action against something that might blow up and become big, because like the internet they want to profit from it as leeches. 
I don't think they have a play, it's already too late. They will believe that their trump card is that you must pay taxes in dollars and they can thereby prevent total repudiation, and this is largely true, but it won't mean much if bitcoin wins long-term.

I can think of a better reason. If Grexit occurs and the drachma is reintroduced, the politicians will seize all bank accounts in euros and re-issue them in drachmas, likely at a significant discount.
It will be quite a haircut, and quite a risk. Use of Euros may even be outlawed to buoy the new currency.
In the face of such a threat, hedging into assets that will likely hold at least some of their value through a currency crisis, should one arise, is not only rational, it's what people have often done in such situations.
One potential for bitcoin is that it can replace this function entirely during currency emergencies, and by this means potentially establish itself as a world currency of account.

Gold may not be a good store of value because its scarcity is an illusion, first of all. We may begin mining asteroids soon, and they have a lot of gold on them. A whole lot of gold, more than has been mined in all of human history in fact.
Secondly, the gold market functions off a lot of scrip, with supposed real gold backing it, but no one can verify that the paper gold actually has real gold behind it, and then there's pre-selling mining years, decades in advance--selling gold that may never even exist.
The inability to verify electronically the scarcity of gold, and the ability to manufacture scrip at will, means it's manipulable in a way bitcoin can't be.

Wrong. You can index the principle balance to deflation and recalculate the payments. The actual additional cost can be ZERO.
The only reason loans are setup to ignore inflation today is because inflation is politically-popular and people imagine they are getting cheaper houses because of inflation. 
In actuality, the math of housing payments makes them pay nearly three times the actual amount loaned, and there are all sorts of contractual tricks employed to ensure that the lender does not lose money on the loan remotely. And lending is locked in by law to this style.
But none of that is necessary. You can easily, easily write a loan contract that would take into account deflation and not cost the borrower extra money thereby. Easily.

You can never peg a unit of crypto to a unit of oil. Never. It will inevitably result in overselling the crypto and underfunding it with assets.
Trying to do so creates a trust layer which anyone is foolish to rely on. Even if you periodically have the assets audited, which is expensive, who audits the auditors.
If VZLA goes to war or falls apart politically, what recourse do you have? The new administration will not likely recognize your deal with the last one, especially since the deal stuck is currently unconstitutional under the VZLA constitution.

You can still earn a profit on a loan by charging interest above the actual indexed deflation rate. You are simply taking deflation or inflation out of the equation and charge a reasonable interest or a flat fee. Say you charge 8% of the principle a year, you can still do that with deflation/inflation indexed out. So in real purchasing-power terms you are making a profit as the lender, even with 'flation effects being ignored.

It has happened before, exchanges and mixers have stopped stolen funds. 
Was this Ripple scenario a stolen fund? No. And no one would ever stop a bitcoin sale because they were worried about the price tanking, that's not possible with bitcoin.
The fact remains that this was possible because the function to freeze funds was added to Ripple's code-base, and Ripple controls Ripple's code. Which means that the government could easily pressure Ripple to freeze any funds it wants at all.
This is not possible with bitcoin because no one controls bitcoin.
Ripple is just as bad as Liberty-dollars in this respect, having a central point of failure, the Ripple corporation.
Not to mention that the whole thing happened because of dispute among the pre-miners themselves, another thing bitcoin doesn't have.

Not exactly. I'm sympathetic to your meaning here, but what bitcoin does is remove the locus of control from legislators and from banks and places it in the hands of all people, or bitcoin holders individually.
That doesn't mean those people might not use their new-found control to trust banks and bank-like entities to perform certain services, such as storing btc long-term, facilitating payments, enhancing security, etc.
It does mean that banks can't illegitimately enrich themselves via inflation-bailouts, transfer fees and gotchas, etc.
People are still going to have credit cards and take out bank loans, only they may do it in btc now instead, and that is the legitimate purview of banking. Banking is not dying, just the worst aspects of modern banking--the parts that rely on fiat--are going away due to bitcoin.
As long as dealing with banks is optional, feel good. This is a major sign of mainstream acceptance. Dropping Goldman-Sachs name on it indicates we're that much closer to winning the argument. GS is more scared of missing the boat and becoming entirely irrelevant than in protecting their existing franchise and control of fiat currency. This will put GS on our team, essentially, in terms of interest, which means regulators won't likely take a hard tack on bitcoin legally.
They're helping us out, and they imagine they can tame bitcoin, but they'll find they cannot. They don't yet realize this, or realize why it should be true when it was never true in the past. 
But take heart, this is a case of a bunch of snakes thinking they've got doves in bag, when really bitcoin is the honeybadger of money, and honeybadgers eat snakes.

Sure, it's called being new. Do you know how long it took for credit cards to be inculcated into consumer habits? Over a decade or more iirc.


The "costs of the second payment system" are paid for by the bitcoin network. And the savings are upwards of 2% - 5% for most companies (since most companies are small, medium companies). That's a rather large incentive that should not be discounted.
If bitcoin wasn't worth using at all, no merchant would bother with it. The fact that many have uptaken it and continue to use it means it's likely to spread until everyone takes it. The value proposition is there.


Every process change carries a psychic training cost. 
















Arguing that they have a higher sales volume currently isn't much of an argument. At one time cash transactions too were 99% of the market and credit cards 1%. Obviously that wouldn't make a good argument that credit cards would never become big business. Similar there were large costs in training employees to take card, and a significant cost in renting card readers, etc., that bitcoin lacks entirely.

But it is irreducible, as with gold.








Bitcoin's inherent value is as a currency, trade-value and value-store value. Similarly only about 10% of gold's value is industrially derived, the rest being in its trade value and value-store value. The two are thereby virtually identical. Commodity value may explain how a physical commodity comes to be held as a money, but after the fact its value as money has come to overshadow its other properties.








That makes no sense. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, meanwhile gold is only rare on earth. A single metals rich asteroid has more gold than has been mined in all of human history, and there are millions of those out there.
















You missed a few. Gold doesn't corrode--neither does bitcoin. Gold is easily identified and winnowed from non-gold, largely due to its yellow color and weight. 
Actually bitcoin beats gold on this count, since fake gold bars are a thing, but bitcoin can be validated mathematically with 100% certainty and very cheaply. To similarly validate gold you need various x-ray diffraction techniques and to melt the gold down for surety. 
And of course you can't send gold digitally, which is where bitcoin starts beating gold. Gold has non-zero travel and storage costs, bitcoin beats it there. Gold is heavy, bitcoin beats it there. Gold is easily stolen, bitcoin can be much harder to steal, in the sense of a brainwallet, ownership in purely non-physical form. Etc.

There are a couple low-hanging fruit to be had that JP Morgan doesn't want to do the grunt work on and will be happy to let the scum companies do, such as remittance (the current lowest-hanging fruit), and later B2B clearing.
This is straight out of innovator's dilemma. They won't realize those small startups are going to become large companies that challeng and replace them until it's too late.
Once you optimize for one business-strategy, it can be nearly impossible to switch gears. Business models die and are replaced, they don't usually become revamped.
Home Depot replaced Sears. Walmart replaced ma&amp;pops. Etc.
Bitcoin is about to replace fiat.
Not because we want it to, but because bitcoin is a far more efficient way to transfer money, which means lower costs for users, and therefore a higher standard of living. All people want a higher standard of living.
JP Morgan sees in efficiency only a significant hit to their profit margins, and a threat to their current profit sources. They will not likely adopt bitcoin but try to subvert and fight it, typically via crony K-street backroom dealing and law-crafting.
However it's not going to work this time, because bitcoin is decentralized and cannot be attacked by legislation, only slowed.
They may settle for a slowed bitcoin in this region or that region. But the places where bitcoin isn't artificially slowed, it will skyrocket.
This is an opportunity for Silicon Valley to decimate Wall Street in financial circles.
I once read a historical account of the centers of finance continually moving West over the centuries, essentially *chasing freedom*, and it looks like Wall St. is about to be replaced by Silicon Valley.

How is that any different from when it was cash vs credit. Cash payments are a thing that already exists and that merchants have embraced too.












Network maintenance is not the same as employee training, which btw should be fairly minimal and relatively one-time, since it's much like credit cards.








Could've made the same argument for taking credit cards back in the day. Actually it's a very good argument because profit is made on the margin, and large companies are adopting early for this reason, because 2-5% back (or less) on their .1% of their sales is actually a lot of money. Overstock did what, $3 million or more their first year taking bitcoin.












All that matters is growth rate, not current numbers. You could've argued "most don't take credit cards" at one point too. That tells you nothing about ultimate uptake. 








In a few marginal cases, get back to me when overall growth is negative.


















Except for making more profit! But lord knows companies don't care about making more profit by not having to pay transaction fees.

That btc first has to leave the hands of its individual owners, and must do so with their consent.
As an example, I've never lost money on a bitcoin exchange that shut down, ala MtGox, and I've never been scammed by a miner that didn't ship, although I did mine.
Even if banks end up holding most bitcoin in the future, it would have to return it to people on demand, people wouldn't accept anything less. Thus if governments become belligerent, simply flee and go elsewhere. Realize that banking with bitcoin is global banking, unlike banking in cash, because cash and checks have to be turned in, in person.
Maybe you'll start bitcoin banking in Hong Kong, or Singapore. Slightest whiff of legal trouble there, begin banking in Switzerland. Etc.
Maybe entirely virtual banks will arise in the netsphere that have no location and thus aren't subject to the will of any legislator. Maybe we'll invent decentralized banking which doesn't even need human control.

I think it's clear why he left.
Because Wikileaks taking bitcoin was about to bring the laser focus of the international spy community onto him personally, and the result of that would likely have been very negative.
I think he was able to remain anonymous for 2 years because he was part of the state-sponsored hacker establishment, likely trained at the highest levels in how to remain undetected online. It's a notoriously difficult thing to do, even the pros abide by rigorous checklists. Yet he did it for years.
And he also seemed to know that he anonymity could be penetrated by a concerted state effort. Because I think he knows what they're truly capable of from being on the inside.
This is also why he doesn't have a public face we can attach him to, and probably why he very much wanted to remain anonymous in the first place. Because he's a state-trained hacker as well, without a public face.
He likely discovered a great interest in money as a function of being trained in crypto, researching the various egold schemes, took it as a project on his off-time, and came up with the blockchain as his brilliant solution. Much of the rest of the work had already been done by predecessors, and it was a matter of adapting it.
How many years did he labor in secret on Bitcoin before revealing the whitepaper, hard to say, but how many people would've done so while trying to remain so anonymous.
He had a reason to stay anonymous.
I think he has the world's best kept and biggest secret in his brain, probably out of a reasonable fear of being turned into a martyr if his identity were made public. Look at what happened to Dorian. Look at what happened to Charlie Shrem.
He is also politically conscious, and would realize that bitcoin could deprive states of control of money, and that this is the most cherished power of the state. For that reason alone he would've been a target.
It doesn't have anything to do with being afraid of success of centralization. He simply knew that Wikileaks accepting bitcoin would undoubtedly kick off a concerted effort by state actors to reveal his identity, and he knew that they were capable of unmasking him if he continued communicating, so he stopped.

It's likely he's familiar with government repression of undesirables. This explains how his opsec was flawless enough to remain clean, and why he booked out when attention was drawn to bitcoin. Unlike the Dread Pirate Roberts, he seems to understand that Tor wouldn't protect him long term. And he picked the one ECC algorithm that wasn't compromised by the NSA. I think he had insider training on opsec. This would help explain how he's disciplined enough not to reveal himself.

Doesn't matter, you can always prove that X are legit and that you own them or that you spent them and where. There's no counterfeit bitcoin, there's no question of whether you paid or not, there no issue of someone creating more bitcoin and diluting your share infinitely (scheduled and capped inflation rate).

You don't need it to confirm faster. And the kinds of transactions you actually need several confirms for, like buying big value items, cars, boats, and houses, already take so much time to complete that bitcoin's confirm time means nothing.
If you're buying a small value item, the double-spend attempt must be done at the exact same time as the spend. So if you don't see a double-spend attempt within seconds, there isn't one and you're fine.
Try actually buying something in bitcoin, it's faster than a credit card.

Roughly 30 years ago I got my first harddrive. It was 20 megabytes in size. We begged our father for it. "You could never in a lifetime fill up a drive with 20 megabytes" I said at the time.
Which would've been true if we had never developed anything except word-processing files that literally filled a dozen kilobytes or so.
Our next HDD was 40 megabytes.
I don't know what's going to happen in the future in terms of HDD size, but what's happened already has certainly surpassed my expectations.
Also, there's no reason to think that an 8gb is necessarily going to be filled. So if it's not needed by the space is still there, it's fine. If we're filling on average 2gb blocks 20 years from now, no sweat. 
But if we really were filling 8gb blocks, then bitcoin would be at the center of world finance with perhaps billions using it for transactions; then 8gb blocks would be a small price to pay for a system that had changed the world.
And that would also create a gigantic incentive to do past block paring, such as is already being worked on by several.
So, I think even 8gb blocks would be fine 20 years from now.
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:53:58

And no one has any incentive to change the 21m cap, at all, and if such a change was made it could be easily ignored by everyone--changes can't be forced on people.
At the same time, the transactions limit change is in everyone's interest and we all expect it to change in time. The original bitcoin protocol had no limit at all. We understand the reasons for it currently, some don't apparently.


Again, disinterest vs interests. The block size limit will never be changed, even though it could be changed.

Let's say I take one grain of sand at random out of a single galaxy, then among a billion galaxies to choose from, I pick one at random and pick a planet at random and drop the grain of sand on the shores of that planet.
Then you come along and randomly choose from a billion of the galaxies and randomly pick from the billions of planets in this galaxy (our galaxy is estimated to have 100 billion planets, btw), and the first planet you pick you land on it, step out of your craft, reach down to touch the surface, and you touch my grain of sand that I dropped there, and when you retract your hand it's the only grain that sticks to your finger.
About that likely.
IOW: never gonna happen.
In fact, if it happens just once in all of human history, assuming good random number generation of course, then we should be very surprised (and we do have good random number generation now, but sometimes hardware or software has mucked up implementation).
So possible? Yes, it's possible. It's just not remotely plausible. You're protected by an incredibly large number. There are more possible bitcoin addresses than there are atoms in the known universe.
It's hard for the human brain to remotely grasp this fact. We think of generating a bitcoin address as using up some hidden quantity of which there is limited supply, like it's a waste or something. But actually it's functionally infinite for the life of the human race, no matter how hard you try to exhaust them.
Even if you built a Dyson sphere around a sun and dedicated all of its power to creating bitcoin addresses with perfect efficiency, quadrillions of them per second, the sun would actually die long before you'd come close to generating a significant fraction of them. Probably not even close to .0001%.

Not significantly, since that would result in a run on gold that couldn't be sustained until the asteroid gold began showing up in markets, and there would be uncertainty as to when this would occur.
Besides, there's a factor a lot of people here are missing--materials in space are more valuable *in space* than they are on land, generally. We can build space-structures in orbit far cheaper than by building on land and rocketing them into space.
It might cost $1,000 to lift a kilogram of gold into orbit, so gold in space is worth it's earth-price plus $1,000. You lose that $1k if you bring it back to earth.
So, asteroid resources will generally tend to stay in space. Gold is a needed commodity in space, since it creates very good light filters and great electronic circuity wire, and for microprocessors, etc. It's also a good weight for counterbalance-mass and gyroscopic applications.
Space can stay gold-rich while earth remains poor in it, to some degree at least.

When the rich get tipped off or feel that an economic downturn is coming, they buy hard assets. Often property, art, jewelry, commodities, etc. 
These are things that hold value and often gain value long term and can be easily liquidated later.
But it is painful to do; funds are locked up for good while this way.
I think we are approaching an era where these same people will realize they can store a portion of their assets in crypto to achieve the same thing without the loss of liquidity.
It will likely start small, and has already been done by some but not by most.
I suppose after 2017 we can consider that very many people bought in, but it still feels like the game is rather early. These kinds of people tend to be quite conservative with buys. They're likely still testing the water.
But when they realize they they can store value in crypto and it's still spendable, and still gaining value over time, we could see the sea change that's been expected for years.

Btw, I would be perfectly happy if the US government decided to create its own blockchain and call it bitDollar or w/e. If they do that, it just means we've won completely.
And the result will be that bitcoin will likely be used as an international settlement and clearance coin between multiple national bit-currencies.
Some have predicted this future, whereby the dollar, the yen, the yuan, the pound, and the ruble end up being the only surviving national currencies, albeit in digital form for this example, and the rest of the world simply uses bitcoin to settle between them.
I'm sure (these) states would like to do this. But all the others would have to realize that it comes at their expense. The result would be a counterculture which should tend to marginalize the state currencies everywhere they're not used, and create bitcoin acceptance literally everywhere, which lays the groundwork for bitcoin-only at some future point.
Because again, the only reason for a state to have its own currency is to that it can very stealthily steal from the people, via inflation. This is why Ecuadoreans abandoned their currency, and why others will in the future as well.
All controlled currencies will eventually self-destruct, because of the perverse incentives created by that control.

Joined the Mises.org forums awhile later looking for more discussion of economics, ran into the strange creatures call ancaps, and the topic of bitcoin came up there in mid 2012, whereup I became interested in the theory of money and spent a good 6 months turning over bitcoin from every direction we could think of, in a legendary thread on bitcoin for its time.
Peter Surda was one of the main proponents besides myself that bitcoin could be money, and there was at least one major denier of that idea. We traded arguments for over 6 months, as I said, and during that process I became convinced that bitcoin could both be money, and that it was in fact a fantastic money.
Never looked back. Sold my paltry stocks and bought bitcoin.
I think that grounding in economic theory has made me a lot more confident of what bitcoin is and what kinds of future is possible for it than the vast majority of people who own bitcoin are just plain aren't sure, or not sure to that degree. I'm sure someone like understands bitcoin in theory as well as I do.

How about "not inflationary" then. Basically the same thing.
Bitcoin will undoubtedly be stable one day, once its market penetration is at the saturation point. We're not nearly there today, and the price uncertainty is primarily caused by uncertainty in how long it will take to get there, or if it will get there at all (skeptics).
If it take 5 years, bitcoin is incredibly underpriced. If it takes 50 years, we're maybe on track. If it never happens, bitcoin is overpriced.
Most people are relying on status-quo bias. Which is the same reason lots of people suggested that computers didn't have a future, and the internet wouldn't make an impact, etc.
Status-quo bias is useful in many situations, but it tends to lead people astray in making common-sense judgments about high-tech fields. 
The amount and kind of knowledge it takes to understand in a deep way why bitcoin is valuable and useful is something the masses will never have in aggregate.
Instead, they will look at what smart people are doing with bitcoin, and things will move in that direction. This is the role of the early adopter, to take a risk, and to bet their social credibility on how sure they are that this tech is a gamechanger. This is also what early speculators will be paid for in price-gains if bitcoin goes large, they will earn a lot of money by bringing up and bringing to the attention of the masses a better way of transacting, something that materially improves lives.
If you make every transaction on the planet 1% - 3% more efficient, that ends up being a gigantic standard of living increase for the entire world.
Satoshi made that happen, but without early adopters it also wouldn't have happened.

Actually, this isn't well generally understood, but the DeLorean's brushed stainless-steel exterior is easily converted into a Faraday cage due to being paintless, which is a key environment for obtaining flux-capacitor destination accuracy. Without that the target time-coordinates and location achieved tend to drift by hours or days depending on local spacetime waves / concentrations. This also prevents wormhole-searing which can be an eyesore, there's no paint to burn.
Thus it's been a popular and stylish choice among time travelers generally. Though they can be a bit cramped.

No, because at the time it took an advanced leap of ideology and understanding to even realize that a cryptocurrency could function as money. He was not a casual huckster. He understood at least marginally the Austrian case for gold and monetary theory in general, why inflation is a problem and undesirable. Bitcoin was political from the beginning, with the opening message he put into the blockchain serving as implication for the existence of bitcoin. Events since then have only further validated his implication. Governments have doubled down on inflation and low interest rates, ironically creating the perfect environment for a deflationary crypto-coin to catch on.








Been awhile for me too.








Not if you want to go on the evidence. It's not like he's an entirely mysterious figure, we have two years of verified writings from him. He was not 'intentionally difficult' in his communications with others. He was not greedy. He didn't sell his million bitcoin just because the price broke a dollar. He is some kind of pure inventor whom I believe is unlikely to cash out ever. He may even have destroyed his keys as a donation to humanity, and to prevent them from being used against bitcoin in the future.

You'd be wrong, due to fractional reserve banking. They only have 1/9th the amount of cash their books shown. And most of that is one deposit with the fed.
In exchange for going with fed rules they get FDIC insured, meaning the Fed will print money for them to distribute if they ever get low. Anything to prevent the appearance of insolvency and thus bank runs.
I've often wondered if it is even possible anymore to start a bank that isn't FDIC insured and just do 100% reserves--no risk of a bank-run ever, but the business model needs work.

The network effect and path dependence make this very unlikely. Bitcoin won't be outdeveloped for the same reason a retailer is very unlikely to accept an altcoin after they've accepted bitcoin.
Any idea you had that could make a better altcoin, you're better off submitting to bitcoin where it can make the biggest impact. 
Even if you didn't go to bitcoin with the idea, you have to open source it for it to be accepted by anyone, and thus bitcoin can leech the idea from there easily.
You can't keep the idea secret because people won't trust it.
All this means that any idea big enough and important enough to threaten bitcoin would inevitably be absorbed into bitcoin, thus crushing the altcoin like a bug.
Most people, however, do not understand the economic impact of the network effect and path dependence, and so the ideas you've tossed here seem more reasonable. But they explain why no altcoin has come close on price, and aren't likely to either.

Chinese buying-pressure up to $470. After it should taper off. Markets tend to push up towards psych-points strongly then taper demand. But the western psych point of $500 is right behind it, so. Who knows.
We should also consider the yen. 60,000 yen is $495. So you've got a double psych-point at nearly $500, Japan and dollars. 
And if we're gonna do that, what about the Euro? Looks like there's a Euro psych point at 440, which is 400 Euro.
And we just hit the $420 psych-point, apparently.
It's likely to rocket up to $500.
One reason demand tends to soften at psych points is because sellers tend to cluster sell-triggers at or just before the psych-points. Few people will pick a random number like $466 as their sell-trigger. They'll pick more often $450, $475. $500. Some will try to just beat the psych-point at $499, or $489 of those trying to beat the psych-point beaters. Etc.

You could run the entire world economy on one bitcoin for the rest of human history. This is not a problem. And deflationary currencies are good. If you don't know why, you need to read up on some economics that isn't artificially propped up by those who have an interest in inflation.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:57:55
Again, even if you don't like Austrian economics, this fact is apodictically-true.
If you have goods at X price with Y quantity of money and you increase Y quantity of money, that is you inflate, then the X price must rise.
Where did the value of the new quantity of money come from? It's quite obviously being paid for by everyone who now pays higher prices and did not receive extra money. Primarily, the poor; inflation hurts the poor the most. This is then an invisible form of taxation, and functions as a transfer of value from all holders of cash to the inflaters, ie: the government and their allies.
You don't need Austrian economics to accept this, it is quite obviously true.
And again, if you want empirical evidence, then begin your study of Venezuela, because that is exactly what they are doing, or any of the many other places that hyperinflated.

It's a bit of both, and a conflux of either. Bitcoin can rise in value / demand, causing its dollar value to go up. Or the dollar can be inflated, causing bitcoin's value in dollar-terms to go up.


Goods are always far less volatile when priced in a single currency. Bitcoin appears more unstable than it is due to all of us using the dollar or some other currency to judge it with.

You don't understand. The dollar is the best fiat. It can't be easily beat by another fiat because all other paper fiat is in the same category, constrained by the same limitations, have the same qualities, etc. Some may be easier or harder to counterfeit or w/e, but still you don't beat the dollar by building a better fiat with all the same qualities.
What you need is a money of a different category. Bitcoin--digital money. Digital is a new category and allows for bitcoin to have certain qualities the dollar / fiat cannot have.
After digital what new category can you imagine existing? I'm not sure there's another something beyond digital in the way that digital was beyond material.

It's not really possible, because mining profit is only a few percentage points above mining costs. The price must roughly double for mining to continue at present levels.
When the cost of mining rises higher than the reward, mines doubt stop mining but they do stop selling, and they *start buying* so they can recoup at least some of present losses when they price rises inevitably.
That double whammy of stopping selling and starting buying will cause a price rise.

That's how prices on an exchange work though. Take the current value of all bitcoins, what is it about $3.5 billion? 
If you tried to buy all the bitcoin, that would start increasing the price of bitcoin concomitantly.
People would very quickly realize there's someone out there willing to spend a whole lot of money for bitcoin. There's only a few thousand bitcoin available on the market at any one time anyway.
Soon people are asking $5k, $10k for a bitcoin, and the government KEEPS PAYING IT.

Actually money is defined by transacting. That which is used as a medium of exchange is being used as a money, doesn't matter what that is. Trust plays a role in what people will be willing to use as money, but it doesn't define money.
And his qualifier about ordinary people needing to understand the programming code is dumb. Ordinary people just have to watch the actions of experts in coding and what they do, which is call it incredibly secure and hardy code, and they've generally bought into it and trusted it. 
If expert programmers wouldn't touch bitcoin, that would be a major red flag, but the opposite is the case.
Also, money doesn't have to be a long-term value store at all. Its essential quality is transactional.

Those trying to cash out gains always sell into strength, which tends to correlate with good news. They're profit taking on good news. They always overdo it a bit and cause a price dip. But they obtain this way more value than selling at random.
It's a fairly natural and easy phenomena. There might even be bots that just look for the word bitcoin on news sites and sell into news.
It isn't entirely negative. It provides liquidity for people, lets new people buy at lower prices, etc.
At some point bitcoin becomes valuable enough that people begin hoarding it to the exclusion of other currencies, and people won't even want to profit-take anymore. Who knows when that could be, but I think it a likely eventuality (especially with how the world economy has been going lately and the financial shenanigans in response.)

Physical backing simply limits the max-amount of currency.
Bitcoin is limited-issue as guaranteed by the math and protocol behind it.
Both are two ways of achieving the same thing, creating a limited issue.
There is no problem with bitcoin not having physical backing and still serving as currency just fine. People who think this way tend to have a psychological bias against non-material objects have value, but that is a 20th century way of thinking and we live in the 21st, where digital objects have value all over the place.
Bitcoin is the first digital object that cannot simply be copied infinitely due to the shared ledger property of cryptocurrency, and thus can be used as money.

Bitcoin's upside potential pricewise is limited by comparative utility with other currencies.
If the price goes to, say, $3000 and most people prefer dollars, the price self limits because people will cash out.
Bitcoin will only skyrocket in price on the day that people will rather hold cryptocurrency than fiat. It comes down to that.
At that point, even if the price skyrockets people will keep holding in Bitcoin rather than cash out.
The current talk of negative interest rates and capital controls is exactly the kind of thing that could push people into the cryptocurrency camp. And there's no going back.

That's not how the price of gold is manipulated though. Future rid supply and demand, they do not directly create it.
The way the gold market is being manipulated right now is they began to sell "future-mining of gold," ie: actual gold that had not yet been mined.
They began to do this about the same time that actual tonnage from mining began to drop precipitously. Yet they simply kept selling these claims on future mining proceeds, even though these claims could, at this point, never ever be filled by future mining.
It's to the point where the number of outstanding claims on future mining of gold is now 330 times the total known amount of physical gold on earth that has already been mined. They simply invented paper gold and began selling it as physical gold.
Now back to my rationale--they would be unable to sell 330 multiples of the number of outstanding bitcoin, because everyone would know this is a fraud. Unlike gold where there is no known maximum quantity, there is a known maximum quantity of bitcoin, and every single piece of it has a unique address.
So while it would be feasible to sell future-mining shares of bitcoin, we all know exactly how much future bitcoin will be mined, and at what rate, and when that ends. No one could sell, today, 10 million shares of future mining in bitcoin, because that will never exist, much less 330 times the total.

Right, that tipping point when it's better to save in bitcoin than to ever cash out into some paper currency, that's when numbers get big. Right now people still trust cash more than fiat for keeping and spending, so when the price goes up it's tempered by people cashing out to keep gains.

The most important factor regarding the halvening is what miners will do.
When mining is no longer profitable the miners stop selling, *and start buying*. This is so they can recapture some of that lost value when the price finally rises to the point that it is worth mining again. 
They will begin selling when the price is over the mining cost again, with some extra to make up their losses.
So we can expect at least a doubling of the bitcoin price. And likely market exuberrance surrounding that.

Capitalism allows for creative destruction. That is, when companies fail, capital is transferred out of the hands of those bad managers of that capital and into the hands of good managers of capital, defined as people who aren't bankrupt at that point and have money to spend to buy up the companies of the people who are now bankrupt.
This allows the economy to progress.
If instead the government is bailing out firms, it is preserving the management of bad managers over significant amounts of capital.
Similarly, if gigantic amounts of money are coming out of the government to fuel all sorts of sectors, that becomes a heroin-drip and then a flood, that re-orders the economy towards that flow of money.
We have now entered an economy that is essentially immune to injections of new money by the government. Look at the trends since 2008, the economy has flat-lined, producing 7+ years of stagnant growth, despite massive capital injections.
Creative destruction was not allowed to occur.

You do realize that ASICS are more efficient than even a supercomputer, because ASICs can only do one thing, and it does it incredibly well, on the scale of a supercomputer. Meanwhile, actual "supercomputers" that you're talking about here are more generalized and actually less efficient than ASICs, and just a few ASICs would rival the power of a supercomputer going head to head on the task the ASICs were designed for that the supercomputer was not.
The Bitcoin hashing network has more hashing power than the most powerful top 500 supercomputers in the world *combined* IIRC, possibly more than that by now.
The only way the US could compete would be to make its own ASICs, and it could only achieve securing the bitcoin network, not much else. Any alt chain it tried to create would be forked and ignored by everyone else. The US would've spent billions to no avail.

Gold might not be liquid enough, I'm thinking. CBs are holding foreign currency to make rapid moves, ala how China defends the renminbi with rapid buying and selling of dollars and the like, in order to punish speculative shorts and the like, thus fending off future attacks.
Bitcoin, though, should be liquid enough to serve that function, once it has a much larger value-base. $7 billion isn't enough to make big moves.

The dogecoin people were not all merely light-hearted jokesters. They believe that bitcoin's price rise was due to press it had received, so they set about creating news for dogecoin with various charity giveaways and the like, and trying to use it as much as possible.
What they discovered is that correlation is not causation.
No amount of good press can makeup for dumb economic decisions. Deciding to do away with the hard limit on how many dogecoin could exist doomed the currency and people fled.

You likely deal almost entirely in checks and credit/debit transactions, in which case they answer is they already know.

Since 2008, the Fed printed some $33 trillion in money designed to rescue companies friendly to the government and powerful enough to have political-capital to play.
Would you actually call that an apolitical move?
Because if politics had nothing to do with it, then Fed would've printed *nothing* and allowed companies to fail. In fact, a lot of banks did fail, or were forced to be purchased by other banks by the government, and it was Fed money that made that possible.
We also know the government has a market-rescue service that started up in the Reagan era, where do you think they get their money:

I think it's very likely that whoever Satoshi was had both very good training in how the government discovers people's identity, because Satoshi for nearly two years did not leak his identity, which is very hard to do. But someone with government training in doing it regularly would be more than capable, and someone with a good idea of how governments do that would be able to do it successfully without slip-ups (look how easily DreadPirateRoberts was caught in the end).
And secondly, someone with training in how programs are easily hacked and thus the knowledge to create a nearly bulletproof codebase to start with, something that had essentially never been achieved in this space before and that many had thought was basically impossible.
The bigger question is whether it is someone that had been active for a long time in cypherpunk circles or only someone who was reading silently on the sidelines. The latter is much less likely.
If I was looking to find Satoshi, I'd start with those cypherpunk circles. It's likely Satoshi was a long-time participant there, one way or another.

QC cannot crack a non-spent-from address *at all*--info must first leak from a private key via some means before it can be computed, and bitcoin's default behavior is not to re-use addresses.

How do you know? You are making a claim that cannot be at all proven. The only way to prove it would've been to let it happen and see what results. But since we instead acted strongly against that, then we cannot know at all what would've happened.
Austrian theory suggests we would've faced a sharp and painful, but quick, recession, even depression, but that this correction would put the economy back onto a footing to achieve real future growth. And we would face such a sharp mini-depression precisely because it's a correction for all the monkeying in the economy the government has been doing to forestall past recessions.
Had we simply let the corrections happen in the past they would be small and tolerable, but now they are building up into a tsunami.
Instead of that, we spent $33 trillion to avoid a sharp recession, and now we face flat stagnation for the last decade+.
Study the Japanese stagnation over the last 25 years, and now they've gone full Keynesian with Abenomics, trying to desperately spend their way out of a slump and it's simply not working.
So too the US will face increasingly muddy stagnation until we stop trying to control the economy.

Look at how Bitpay and Coinbase handle it. They briefly look for a double-spend attempt, which must begin at about the same time as the actual transaction to succeed. If a DS attempt is not spotted in 10-15 seconds and the transaction is about $100 or less, it's reasonable to call it good and done.

It takes about that long to design and build a world-leading ASIC that could do this.

K, keep believing that I guess. But mining costs do affect the price. When the cost to mine is higher than the bitcoin price, miners stop selling but they don't stop mining. That reduction in supply causes a supply shortage, demand goes up. The price has more than doubled shortly after the last two halvings. Last Halving the price went from around $350+ to $700+ and kept going.

And you think a fiat currency somehow would be better on this judgment? I've got news for you. Bitcoin's price fluctuation is a product of its newness and growing confidence and little more. If everyone knew about it completely already it'd have a stable price already.
In the long run, having a fixed supply is the most important factor in holding and guaranteeing long-term value, and bitcoin has that whereas fiat does not. In fact, the current reserve currency, the dollar, is fucking over the whole world of dollar holders right now with nearly two-digit inflation.


That depends on capitalization. If it swells in size to say $50 trillion in capitalization, it will be able to accomodate transactions of any size and also retain an exceptionally stable price, because no one transaction could cause so much as a ripple in demand compared to total capitalization. So, I wholeheartedly disagree.


Ridiculous. Bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distance transactions, hands down. This has nothing to do with drugs or porn necessarily--it's an advanced for anything purchased online or overseas.

Well, price is a function and buy and sell on exchanges. So if it gets bought more than sold, its price will go up inexorably. In theory, the more it gets used each year the more valuable it should become therefore. It would be unheard for a currency to lose value as it becomes more relied upon by people.
When currencies die it's because no one's using them, demand has dropped out of the floor. A growing currency is one where more and more people are using it, and value generally correlates up along the way.
Your point about mere unit division is a good one, however.
It's better to say if the market cap were X, then bitcoin would have to be Y. But there is likely to be decent correlation between increasing use and price.
It would be interesting to do some historical analysis on what the price was when it was used for X amount of transactions by month.

Bitcoin has a real economic value driving this price gain: bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions.
Imagine making an entire economy of transactions 1-2% cheaper. That is a whole lot of value bitcoin is unlocking, raising everyone's standard of living.
And that is why it's worth something rather than nothing and why its price continues to grow as new people learn about its advantages, try it, and begin demanding more of it.

Bro, do you even economics?
Price (for anything) is the confluence of supply and demand. Supply is relatively static. Therefore if demand goes up (ie: wall st buying in) the price must rise.
Higher prices will cause some subset of people holding bitcoin to sell, so supply isn't completely static, but new supply is, so there's that.

No, they don't, not today's commercial miners doing it for a living.
They keep mining, but they stop selling, and they actually start *buying*, in order to hedge and make up the losses they're suffering until the price recovers. 
Which it will when ~1800 daily mined coins are pulled out of circulation leading to a supply shock. There's no point in selling at a loss.
Later when the price goes down after a period of exuberance, the high-cost miners do shut-down and never come back, but not the pros who know what they're doing, doing this for a living, and who know they are a lowest-cost miner.
Then the price goes back up, they sell and recoup losses with what they bought.
At least, during the halvenings this is what occurs.

That's not the issue. The issue is that when you buy something you have to then have it sent to you or receive it somehow. How do you receive something anonymously--much harder. Usually we simply trust the seller with our information by necessity. Nakamoto's opsec does not allow this, naturally.
So, he'd need to at some point use a coin-mixer. But his opsec probably doesn't allow that either, too much wiggle-room even there. 
If I had to guess, I'd say he's probably waiting to see what world reception of bitcoin turns out to be before revealing himself. If and when bitcoin gains world acceptance, he might come out.
But perhaps he intends to never do so, as things could still go sour at that point, and he'd be known as a very rich man which carries its own problems.

Regardless, actually.
The reason is because if your market cap is, let's say $100 trillion dollars, then a $1 million purchase won't even make a noticeable ripple across that ocean of value. Even a billion dollar purchase would be virtually invisible on the price charts of such a market cap.
Price swings and market cap are inherently dependent. The higher the market cap, the more stable the price will be.

In case you weren't following the news lately, the Saudis are actually quite angry with us currently and have practically cut ties.
And it was just an example. It's not impossible to think a foreign government mad at the US might not glory in bitcoin if they could. 
In actual fact, we buy most of our oil from south America and produce a ton ourselves.
But if the Saudis took bitcoin for oil the effect would be to pull the lynch-pin on the petro-dollar, threatening the US's status as sponsor of the world's reserve currency.
If central banks flood into bitcoin and out of dollars, the results would be dramatic. And the funny thing is, the first one to do it wins and the last guy gets left holding the bag.
I could see someone like China doing that. I think knocking the dollar off its pedestal is one of their long-term goals.

If voting could change anything it would be illegal.
The majority vote is nothing more than a tool of collectivist rule, seeking to supplant the will of the individual with that manufactured in the collective. Demogogues who can control the public mind then become the most powerful people in society.

@_date: 2013-12-18 22:32:54


People didn't decide, government decided.
If you place a free market currency next to a government currency and give people an actual choice, people will choose (and are choosing in the form of Bitcoin) the free market currency.
This is because all government currencies are managed to the benefit of the government at the expense of the users of that currency generally--known as inflation, systematic theft of value from an entire society on a scale unprecedented in human history.
If this were not true, governments wouldn't have to use force, that is they use law, to force people to use their currency and keep out other currencies. Yet they all do so.


The cryptocurrency concept is the cat out of the bag, the genie out of the bottle. The blockchain is here to stay. If bitcoin fails it will only be because governments have flexed their muscles of tyranny to the Nth degree to make it fail, not because people decided otherwise or because bitcoin had some flaw necessarily.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:07:43


Exactly. The only people who might lose out are the ones already trying to pump and dump unsophisticated bitcoin investors on the exchanges. They'll be facing million-dollar trading bots instead of ones hacked together in mom's garage.
Strong hands will win by holding long-term.
If anything this will be one of the few times in history that the average person has jumped into a major investment before wall-st.
Typically Wall St uses government force to keep people out of early promising investments by using the law to limit them to registered investors (already rich investors).

Beautifully written, Erik.
\*standing applause*
When you talk about the value in the protocol and english 2.0, you make the fantastic point otherwise known as path dependence and the bandwagon effect. The more people that choose bitcoin and use it, the more valuable it becomes to other new people, the more likely they are to choose to use it, and the cycle continues.
Economist Peter Surda goes into these concepts deeply in his [2012 master's thesis on bitcoin.](

Oil has utility though, it's limited then. Currency is useful as currency, and there's no upper bound on its price driven by utility.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:02:26


Gee if only bitcoin's value were as stable as gold.
Oh wait, gold lost 25% of its value this year. Damn.
Firstly, I said Saudi doing this isn't something it could do today due to low market cap. Secondly, volatility is in part a function of low market cap.
So, when bitcoin's value is, let's say $200 billion, there's also far less of a chance of wild value swings.
Thirdly, such value swings are driven largely by regulatory viewpoint, which are only now emerging. China bought in, the value goes sky-high, then China's rulers say, "Hey now, slow down, let's not use this as a currency but as a commodity," and some Chinese sold, the price of bitcoin crashes down to about ~$800 after gaining $1100 (it didn't see $600 but for a few minutes and generally crashed back down to $700-$800, and it's currently $950 or so). 
Fourthly, such crash are rare and have only happened three times in bitcoin history over a period of 5 years, and are the kind of thing you would expect in a youthful currency because no one knows how much trust to put in it yet, and how it will do is in part determined by factors outside of it, such as regulatory viewpoint..
Fifthly, there are ways to write a purchase contract to avoid wild swings in price, like pricing against a commodity basket (ie: as much bitcoin as it would cost to purchase X amount of gold+silver+whatever averaged together). 
Sixthly, when bitcoin becomes a unit of account, such swings largely disappear. If you're Japanese using the yen and you want to buy dollars, only wednesday the yen might gain 25% against the dollar, making everything priced in dollars seem far cheaper, but for dollar holders--for whom the dollar is their unit of account--nothing has changed.
So, for this and even more reasons, read more closely next time, learn more about bitcoin, and you are wrong. Bitcoin can't even accommodate $800 billion in yearly oil transactions to the US alone unless it had significantly larger market cap, and at the point that it does its volatility will be consequently significantly reduced.

Bitcoin is like the giant redwood which grows from the smallest of seeds, what's important is not size but its promise.
The dollar is a mighty green fortress built on a foundation of sand and a storm is blowing in; for all its strength against attackers, its walls will fall under their own weight.
The Euro is a starving cow in a field with no grass for as far as the eye can see; to sate its hunger it is chewing the very fur off its own legs.
The Yen is a man who eats nothing but rabbits, who starves to death despite his belly being full of thin meat.
The Renminbi is a squirrel who has decided to retire now that he has a few trillion nuts stowed away in a tree that he doesn't realize will be entirely burned away in the forest fire to come, resulting from the lightning strike that is now smoldering into flame 10 miles away.
Every fiat money has eventually failed. The dollar, the euro, the yen, the renminbi--these too shall pass.
Bitcoin is perfectly positioned to pick up the pieces.

But why did that gold standard fail? Is it really fair to say it failed, when central government hold nearly all the world's gold today.
What you really mean is that governments co-opted gold for themselves, even made owning it illegal in the US for a time, so that they could appropriate gold to themselves.
Since this is true, we must say that gold failed as a monetary system but not as a store of value.
And the reason is not due to any defect in gold itself, but because governments wanted to inflate the currency and could not because it was backed by gold.
So, gold did not fail, democracy failed. It substituted a good money--gold--for a far inferior money, fiat, and maintained that monopoly by force.
If any blame at all is to be put on gold then it is that gold has a physical existence which allows it to be confiscated.
Thus then, bitcoin is a superior currency to gold since it cannot be simply seized physically because it has no physical existence.

Bitcoin is the lowest-cost currency for online and distanced transactions.
That might threaten companies who business is charging for transactions (they are officially dinosaurs now), but it doesn't threaten business generally--in fact they love lower transaction costs.
Apple may have its own payment network getting ready to run causing it to deprecate bitcoin apps, but that actually doesn't stop it from rolling bitcoin-acceptance into its own payment processing at some point.
It's just trying to keep companies from digging under its walled garden. Ultimately Apple doesn't care if you want to pay in bitcoin, they're just protecting their 30% cut right now.
I predict we'll see Apple roll bitcoin-acceptance into their own payment networs long-term.

Which is few people, afaik. He's fairly mainstream himself.
Or are you one of -those- bitcoiners, one not drawn here for ideological reasons like most early adopters.

When you use a piece of software to initiate a transaction, it broadcasts it peer-to-peer on the bitcoin network, these peers / miners are also running bitcoin software and log the transaction thus confirming it. Any subsequent transaction with the same coins they'll disregard. The transaction is permanent at the point it's included in a found block by miners, but for all intents and purposes that's a foregone conclusion once you've broadcasted the transaction, which is why your software shows a completed purchase almost immediately.
This is why Bitpay confirms a buy in seconds. It just sees the transaction being brodcasted and then looks for a double-spend attempt--which must happen at nearly the same time if it hopes to succeed--and seeing none it confirms the buy.


You can look up your address on sites dedicated to parsing the blockchain, like blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com. Try putting the address you received money at into google and see what comes up. There you can find the transaction history. You'll be able to see from which address the tip came, but this will tell you little to nothing about who actually owns that address, and this is the foundation of bitcoin pseudo-anonymity.


No idea, there are places the aggregate who takes bitcoin. I think someone mentioned a bitcoin app that checks on bitcoin-accepting businesses by GPS and routes you. If that doesn't exist yet it soon will I'm sure.


- Seasteaders want to use bitcoin as a native currency on their alternative community.
- There's very good stories on this sub about people saving a lot of money using bitcoin to remit money back home to places like Nigeria rather than using Western Union which charges 5%-10%. Remittance should be one of the largest and fastest-growing uses short-term for bitcoin.
- Go actually buy something from a merchant using Bitpay and report on the experience. I personally found it faster and easier than using a credit-card online.
- The most important thing to understand about bitcoin is that it is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions. This is the heart of the value it brings to the world, its unique value-proposition and why it has a non-zero price. 
The fact that this is true is why it's so powerful when used for remittance--it's far cheaper for online and distance transactions. 
So you only have to ask yourself if online and distanced transactions are going to be more or less prevalent in the future?
I think we're entering a world where all transactions will contain an online component--we're already there with credit-cards for in-store, in-person transactions. 
Once banks start using bitcoin to replace ACH transfers between each other, things get really interesting.

$3m per bitcoin times 21m bitcoin roughly equals world GDP, that's what I'm shooting for.

Well, their GDP is about 1/7th of the US's. We can expect a bump from them but not a massive one short-term.
The more important aspect is that India has a lot of nerds already who could easily and quickly adopt bitcoin and begin building infrastructure based on it, because India is not highly developed yet. 
Long-term that could be extremely positive. More promising than Africa short-term, less controlled a society than China and thus less liable to sudden reversals like we've seen.

Ugh, please edit the OP so your paper is readable. It looks like that because you put 4 spaces in front of each line which Reddit interprets as code, not text.
Take those lines out and instead start with a &gt; and use two new lines per paragraph.

Couple of them are full-timers, like JGarzik, paid by the bitcoin foundation, which is turn is paid by miners and businesses with interest in bitcoin.

They do that today using contracts on future produced gold being mined. They aren't likely to be able to do that with bitcoin.

That's my point, the bitcoin payment would have to go through Apple, thus app-controlled sends and receives must be denied as they don't go through Apple.
But fuck Apple.

This is, I think, why we've seen them come in and not sell. The Chinese may prove to be very strong hands by comparison with early adopter Americans. We may not see a crash down to $300 or w/e (tho I hope we do).

The detractors have been so very wrong so far, both in their analysis of the theory of money as it applies to bitcoin (see Gary North even) and in their projections of imminent doom.
