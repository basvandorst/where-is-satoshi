And yet segwit transactions which would have the ability to make the most dramatic impact on the size of the mempool remain stuck at only 10%.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:39:17
Unfortunately yes to get segwit change you need to specify a custom change address as well which only shows up if you enable coin control features. The change address will likely be fixed along with the GUI.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:27:35
You really should include the way to generate a P2SH segwit address from bitcoin core using the command line as it's not that hard. It's only one command to create a segwit address from an existing legacy 1x address. Pick a 1x address from your existing bitcoin core wallet and then using bitcoin-cli use this command:
    bitcoin-cli addwitnessaddress 1x...
This will then give you a 3x address on the command line that you can then send money to in your wallet. You can send bitcoin to that address and it will show up in bitcoin core and then any money that goes into and out of that 3x address is using segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:15:06
You're welcome. I know it's not noob friendly but the difficulty of how to use segwit on bitcoin core currently is being greatly exaggerated and making it look like there's no support in it which is blatantly wrong. That and the fact that no exchanges would be using the GUI anyway and this shows how simple it would be if exchanges were using bitcoin core to do their work (which they probably aren't; they're probably using entirely custom software.)

Repeating my last post from the previous FAQ thread:

It's only one command to create a segwit address from an existing legacy 1x address. Pick a 1x address from your existing bitcoin core wallet and then using bitcoin-cli use this command:

You can send bitcoin to that address and it will show up in bitcoin core and then any money that goes into and out of that 3x address is using segwit. You can do this for any number of 1x addresses to get new addresses.
That then mitigates the need for users to migrate to another wallet when the GUI will be in the next release and keeps them on a full validating node instead of encouraging people to use a light SPV wallet.
@_date: 2018-09-26 00:29:31
Not a viable attack since all the other pools are now mining without the exploit and they'd just orphan your blocks and you'd never create a chain long enough for validating but non-mining nodes to follow you unless you had more hashpower than half of the rest of the pools combined.
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:53:17
Pools send out a template of what goes into a header that they must not change, and things that the miners are allowed to change. The nonce and extranonce are the bulk of what the miners are allowed to change today, and the nonce has a limited range of 4 billion while the extranonce is of variable length, but usually also about 4 billion. Most mining software simply counts upwards from 0 to 4 billion on the nonce and then increments the extranonce by one. Rinse and repeat. They get templates of work from the pool usually somewhere between 30 and 90 seconds apart so they never run out of work space. Every miner gets a unique template from the pool so there's no overlap. Some pools use even bigger extranonce space allowing virtually all the hashrate on earth to not run out of possible guesses from one template.

That's where the vast majority of early bitcoiners, developers, miners, advocates, and community, first clustered. It is still today a wealth of knowledge and while many of the original people have gone, quite a lot are still there. While the older members of the forum still there are far less active there today, it is still a wealth of knowledge and information. It is FAR more frequented than the r/Bitcoin subreddit and one of the moderators here is actually the admin of that forum (theymos). The biggest problem with it is that it's been around so long that it also has attracted the biggest number of scammers, fly-by-nighters, and people from everywhere trying to find a quick buck from bitcoin. Carefully navigated, it is very useful. I've been there since 2011 and am very well known by a different handle there and post and participate regularly. Reddit I just browse and almost never post or comment as the communication format is more suited to news snippets rather than meaningful discussion.

MP3 is lossy compression and the blockchain needs to be perfectly reproduced which means lossless compression would be required. Different data has wildly different levels of compressibility, and the blockchain happens to be very poorly compressible. The overhead in compression and decompression wouldn't make it worth the minor gains in size.
@_date: 2018-09-20 07:15:52
Yes the pool has its own internal mechanism to ensure it always serves unique templates to each miner, and unique templates with every update as well. There isn't a definitive resource for how it's done because bitcoin itself doesn't stipulate at all how mining should work, just what constitutes a block. The basic information is here:  but the documents describing how the stratum protocol works, and the code behind the cgminer mining software and ckpool software, for example, are reference implementations of working with it. Stratum came about in a hurry and never had nice complete documentation before all the pools simply adopted it, but here is a collection of what is available: 
@_date: 2018-09-20 07:40:34
True, they entirely eliminate the possibility of duplicate guesses, and pools will actively filter out duplicate results to prevent miners exploiting that as a way to get paid for more results. All pools currently in operation mining bitcoin use stratum, and geography is basically irrelevant with stratum templates. Its efficiency lies in the minimal amount of data required to be sent to miners specifically (compared to the getwork protocol of years ago) but is also efficient with the data sent from miners as well.

Yes it is that easy. Provided you have power and an ethernet connection to plug into it, all you would need to do is log into it remotely from a computer to configure it, set it up to mine at a pool of your choice (I recommend [ckpool.org]( and then just forget about it after that.

I don't know what blocksize issue you're talking about. Provided segwit transactions are used, blocks can be 4x larger than before segwit deployment. There is no sign that the entire blockspace is being used currently so there is no blocksize issue. Blindly increasing the blocksize capacity in lieu of a possible future requirement a decade away is folly. Continual improvements in efficiency along the way and adjusting capacity in other ways if and when needed makes much more sense.

Speed of confirmations happens at the same rate irrespective of the global hashrate. Blocks happen on average every 10 minutes regardless of what the hashrate is which means transaction securing and processing remains the same. It only transiently increases in speed when there is a hashrate rise until the network difficulty rises to match it.

Mining profit doesn't depend on the instantaneous trade value of Bitcoin at the exact moment it's mined. Most miners accumulate Bitcoin over a period of time and cash in at certain intervals depending on their fund reserves. Furthermore, some mine at an apparent loss currently based on exchange rate, but plan to hodl, betting on it going up in the future.
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:29:28
Not quite. The consensus rules only allow time to be 10 minutes in the past, but 2 hours in the future. Some mining hardware and software uses timestamp rolling as a way of increasing range of work locally; this is most likely what happened in this case, with the earlier block timestamp rolling into the future, whilst the later block using an accurate timestamp.
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:11:10
Only stick miners need to be continually connected to a computer of some kind, but even an RPi will suffice as the "computer". The rest of the miners only need you to connect over a lan just once to configure your miners and then don't need a computer ever again. 800ms ping time is really bad and will lead to a fair amount of lost work in mining during block changes, and could even lead to orphaned blocks if your hardware happens to be the one that finds a block. It's not a show stopper but I would recommend a better connection.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:45:19
Nope, 45 terrahashes is nothing. Most home mining hardware is now in the 10-15TH range.
bitcoin-cli getnetworkhashps
But even then, the network hashrate doesn't tell you your chance of finding a block; the network difficulty does:
bitcoin-cli getmininginfo
  "difficulty": 6653303141405.96,
  "networkhashps": 3.524729311763926e+19,
Multiply the difficulty by 2\^32  and it's about 2.9e+22.
That will give you an idea of how ridiculous it would be to mine Bitcoin with a raspberry pi right now.

Once mined, the "security" of a block is currently proportional to the current network difficulty multiplied by the number of blocks solved since that original block (the so-called "confirmations".) If difficulty drops, the number of blocks mined in the interim far outweighs any significant drop in difficulty. Diff can only drop to a minimum of 1/4 of the current difficulty, and only \~every 2 weeks, thus confirmations tend to be an excellent way to prevent rolling back, and probably the most powerful feature of the blockchain design.

Even if there is a program that can do it, it cannot be *meaningfully* mined with a PC of any sort no matter how powerful for they are trillions of times to slow compared to dedicated hardware called ASICs which are the only reasonable way to mine bitcoin today. PCs would consume 100,000 times more in electricity than they would earn in bitcoin and the bitcoin denomination you'd earn would be so small you wouldn't even get a payout from most pools, and it would be smaller than the minimum required in a transaction.

Presumably they haven't changed their configuration from maxblocksize to maxblockweight. If maxblocksize is still specified at 1MB then it cannot make a block larger than that. Yes the pool owners do not necessarily know what they're doing (especially since we're talking about bitcoin.com here.)

Most mining pools do not have the ability to alter their Coinbase signature without restarting their pool software which is an interruption to their services they'd be loathe to do so what you're asking sounds good in principle but is not as trivial as it sounds.

Nope, it is of no more use than meaning "I intend to send this amount", and the more nodes that have seen that intent are saying "yes I know of their intent." The transaction can be overridden an infinite number of times between that initial broadcast and when a block confirms some other transaction.

No, but there is one advantage of running a full node that might be helpful in that scenario - when bitcoin core is connected continuously to the network, it can make a much better judgement about how the fee will affect the speed of confirmation, and allow you to choose the lowest value fee that is compatible with your confirmation time requirements.
