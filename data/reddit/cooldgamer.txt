awesome 1 coffee

It is, but it also has Bitcoin on it.

Sadly yes, we only raised a 5th of the $25,000 goal so couldn't go bigger

Is making a TV commercial just copying the first one?

Unless you're overclocking there's no reason it can't run off 2.  Been doing it with mine and no problems yet :)

They're a pro trader on Local Bitcoins and a registered company, about as legit as you can get.

I'd love to take the credit, but I didn't organize this, just close to somebody on the team that got some pics :)

Slight correction, we have no idea if the car actually has BTC on it right now.  Their Facebook and website both have a picture of the car with it with the qualifying info, but it may be a photo from last week in Atlanta.  We won't know until the car gets some airtime
Edit: just got shown and looks like they replaced BTC with the regular BK decal.  Killing the stream since this is irrelevant now

You'll need to adjust your laptop to be on the same IP range as the switch.  Here's a few screenshots of how to do it (may be slightly different based on your Windows version)

And this is why passwords alone are a terrible way to keep accounts safe.  It's disturbing that most of these people probably don't even know what 2FA is
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:37:05
A transaction large enough to make a double spend worth it would probably take 2-3 confirmations (most exchanges do).  You'd lose all your income as a mining pool from people not trusting you if you did that.  This was a reasonable concern not too long ago with ghash.io being so big, but now the hashrate is spread out so nobody has more than 18%.
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:22:22
Completely different circumstances.  This is back when the network was extremely small, and one party could have a good percentage of the hashrate.  It was pulled off by the attacker being able to mine 2 blocks in a row, which would be pretty much impossible now short of pool owners collaborating

I think you're confused, I was never able to pay because eBay said the Gyft card was invalid
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:14:27
A double spend is extremely hard to pull off once the transaction has been picked up by even a few nodes.  If their POS system is set up so it only connects to well-connected nodes, it's almost impossible to do.  Trying something like that out is something you do for a large transaction, not spending a few bucks.

I'm pretty sure a coffee shop would take 0 confirmation unless you're buying out the whole store.

Not at all, only had a few feedback under his belt
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:06:33
It was a physical item, nothing digital

Except it's not harmless when it's going to confuse the hell out of new bitcoiners.  Let's not forget about him trying to censor the network (twice), and changing the definition of paper wallets on the wiki.
