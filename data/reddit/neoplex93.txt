Different prices on exchanges lead to arbitrage opportunities. People who see the price difference want to buy on one exchange cheap and sell it high on the other exchange. Thats exactly what happens on healthy markets which is why these arbitrage opportunities close really really fast. The problem with crypto exchangs tho: "It can be quite difficult sometimes to move $ or coins between exchanges. Maybe the network is clogged or the exchange cant keep up with the demand and is behind in verification process so that people cant wire money in. These factors make arbitrage really risky. Crypto is volatile and u dont even know how long it takes till ur coins reach the other exchange. Their might be a crash in the meantime or prices catch up and ur arbitrage oppotunity dont excist anymore. But then u still pay the fees." I could name many examples here. I think u get what iam trying to say. Coinbase is the easiest way to wire money into crypto in my opinion. Setting up an account is really easy and fast + they accept credit card. Which is why they always have newcomer money first.

No its just my way of sending doesnt mean that everyone else thinks the same. First of all.. Every coin is linked to btc (almost every coin) And LTC always gets attention as btcs little brother. ltc is marketed like its btcs little brother. and charlie lee marketed it really well

in order to match with the indicators btc has to discount much further :D This is really not the healthy correction everyone is talking about :D

Hes just self destructive. U dont lose ur temper like that especially if u are (what he claims to be) a selfmade millionaire. Thats quite the opposite of good branding

Its just very hard to eliminate these arbitrage opportunities because it can be very hard to move money between exchanges quickly. Especially with the network congestion that is going on. Bitcoin can take for ever to move to other wallets when the network ist congested. In a good market traders would see immediatly that there is a huge price difference and they would buy coins on cheaper exchanges and sell it on the more expensive once. If the network is congested and BTC transfers take days arbitrage is impossible. Means you have to transfer btc to ltc move it within 1 hour trade it back to btc and sell it. &lt;&lt;-- more transaction higher risk

Well thats the flaw within btc. Thats the reason i didnt buy any in the first place. Demand goes up fees goes up. Doesnt seem right to me.

Thats why i go for coins that eliminated this issue. This market is hype based and many fomo investors are going to be cowed away by this. There might be an update at some point but i dont want to be a slave in fee-handcuffs until then.

Never happend to me once. Used taxi at least twice a day for 8 month. On weekends 3+ times. Its ur attitute. The drivers spot u as a victim on bodylanguage. Same with the sellers on khaosan road. They dont even try to sell me something. Its the way u react to their looks
@_date: 2019-03-03 12:08:11
Takes 1 day to learn basic taxi riding skills. Just look at body language of the locals
@_date: 2019-03-03 12:07:10

If you dont look like a tourist they wont. First thing to do is wearing long jeans. Only that and 50% of all the vendors wont even try
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:24:44
And then u have to develope a stare that cuts right through them. As if they were a invisible ghosts. Not joking!. They see in ur eyes if there is the slightest chance of selling something. If they still try and come closer u slightly click with ur tongue and shake ur head
