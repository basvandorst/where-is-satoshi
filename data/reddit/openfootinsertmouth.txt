Wow, 2 whole bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:20:11


That reinforces the point though. Bitcoin isn't a normal currency or commodity market because it doesn't act like a currency or commodity *should*. The closest market analogy is one that's based on a niche collector's item, where actual liquidity is in the toilet most of the time, and wild price swings are the norm.

Hey what the fuck? I'm not paying for anything, what kind of scam are you trying to run here... [This guy]( said it was possible to convert karma into bitcoin, now where's my goddamn BTC.

I don't really see it as a technological innovation. It gives people the ability to store a random arrangement of bits on a public ledger and then claim that those bits have value. What makes it a money though, if it has very little liquidity? The only way most people can even begin to use it as money involves moving away from the blockchain and putting their money into centralized liquidity schemes like crypto exchanges and Tether.

Why is $3605.22 its true value, and not $7200, or $100? What is this based on?
@_date: 2019-01-19 01:55:01
Doesn't this require a major element of trust in the people that made your wallet, though? And doesn't that go against the trustless principles that were the inspiration for cryptocurrency in the first place?

Gotta agree with you there, scarcity is very important, and uncontrolled inflation is a terrible thing. If anyone could just print up dollars to their heart's delight and get away with it every time, the world's entire economic system would collapse and humanity would be doomed to suffer in some kind of chaotic dark age, where the protections of society no longer exist. I understand how it works. Crypto doesn't seem that scarce to me, when any number of cryptocurrencies can be created on a whim. If one gets too pricey (in terms of actual, useful things they can buy with it), people will just jump to another. The scene will become diluted with many competing currencies and there will never be any agreement on the true value of any of it. It seems like a perfect avenue for those with tons of influence to bend the system in their favor.

Dogecoins are also scarce, and super cheap right now.
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:51:48


It's way more complicated than that. For instance, I'm pretty sure other things like market manipulation and exit scams also come into play. Over the past two years or so, we've witnessed wash trading, faked volume, hard forks, soft forks, exchanges closing shop, so called "hacks", customer funds lost for good... there was an insane amount of new shitcoins and ICOs created that were directly paired with bitcoin or ethereum by the exchanges (thus driving up demand for bitcoin), yet most of them turned out to be scams... All of this crap has an enormous impact on price.

It'll teach them such a valuable lesson about money and life in general. Life will go on and they'll be a little bit wiser. They're extremely fortunate to have you as their teacher, you know. No matter how much money actually changed hands, you just can't put a price on these things.

Clearly, your son's friend at school just invested an additional 750 million dollars into the market somehow, by accepting the DDC for a buck. I don't know who the hell you are or what kind of schools you can afford for your family, but you've got some serious connections to an insanely powerful network of monied elites in your life. What's your secret?
@_date: 2019-01-19 04:03:52
Yes and applying that same logic if you look at just dogecoin, it's very scarce and it always will be. There will always be a finite amount of doge.
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:27:16
Ohh I see ... so if the market for DDC should fall through the floor one year (and I'm not suggesting any sort of crazy conspiracy where this could actually happen), you get to keep 90% of the money the schoolkids dumped into the system just a couple months ago, when interest and volume were at their peak. When it comes time for them to accept their massive loss and move on, you only have to give them a small fraction of DTH back, because the price has plummetted, and even then they have to take their haul to another market if they want to go back to dollars. It's akin to literally stealing their lunch money. That is freaking brilliant, sir.

There has to be a practical limit on how aware the world is of bitcoin, and how many people there are left who don't know anything about it yet.


I'm not sure what you mean by neutral. People will either believe Bitcoin can achieve mass adoption, or they won't. The question is, what ratio is it right now, and what will it be in the future.
@_date: 2019-01-23 06:13:59


Why isn't it going up right now then? What are they waiting for? If all these people believe in it, then it should have been going up all along I would think. It seems like the price is heavily dependent on how many true believers there are, so I'm curious what the 'natural level' of believers in the world really is. As for the non-believers, what's it going to take to change their minds, and is it a 100% sure thing that it will happen? How can we predict the relative number of people that will ultimately end up believing it? 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:55:26
So to summarize, the price is going to start rising sharply because a wave of new people will enter the market, and the reason it isn't going up right now is because these people aren't aware that they want it yet... When do you expect them to start buying up Bitcoin on a massive scale again? This year? Why?


During the peak of the last wave people were having trouble using bitcoin as money because of long transaction wait times, exorbitant mining fees, crazy volatility, reluctance of most vendors of goods and services to accept crypto directly, and exchanges screwing around with people's money, among other things. What is going to change in this respect that will enable people to spend it more freely?
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:52:38
250 mil is okay. A lot of shitcoin inventors like yourself are only worth 1 or 2 hundred million, so you're off to a decent start. You can buy some nice houses or something with all that easy money. You can't buy a small island nation with it, though. Now wait till your son sells that thing for 20 grand... Market cap of $20.0T, baby!! Daddycoin DDC going to tha moon!!

Do you have an understanding of monetary economics and Bitcoin? It seems strange to me that people on social media never want to explain these things for themselves. Where is the enthusiasm? It's super easy to rattle off the name of some random author and tell a person to go stick their nose in a book... but it's much more compelling when you can answer the question yourself. It shows that you are not only knowledgeable about the subject, but so passionate about it that you would be willing to grace other people with your knowledge. OP brings up a legitimate point about Bitcoin in its current form, and this is something that isn't always addressed in some white paper or other online source. Is anyone here actually willing to *talk* about such things?
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:50:03
The wording seems a little misleading. It's the other way around.

Can you tell me your opinion, why did the last wave collapse? I know a lot of exciting things are in development, but this was also the case last year and yet it still crashed. When will this new widespread adoption begin, and what do you think will be the thing that kicks it off?

How are you going to deal with the vultures? Some kind of regulation? The whole reason Bitcoin was created in the first place was to escape the clutches of the regulatory authority. It was practically *made* for vultures.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:03:05
I would hold out as long as I could without taking any of it, even if it ends up being foisted on us for "free". It will be the exact opposite of what Bitcoin was meant to be, and that's a very bad thing.
I can see governments adopting some form of cryto in the future as a way to hook everyone into a nightmarish Orwellian system, where every single transaction (from giving your kid an allowance, to buying a car) is linked to your identity. It will be pushed on society as a way to finally eliminate the last straggling remains of the only truly anonymous form of currency: cold hard cash.

If there was any so-called "Russian interference", it manifested itself because the drooling masses automatically treat the swill they see on twitter/facebook as factual information instead of just listening to their hearts. Maybe blockchain could somehow be used to make voting more secure than the crappy electronic voting machines we have today, but it's not going to help the people develop a better bullshit filter.

There's no doubt about it, the biggest players are shaking down the little guy on a weekly basis now. The system almost appears purpose-built for this kind of activity. It's set up for those who can easily afford the all important transactional fast lane. If these casual investors are so gullible that they would react in such a predictable way (because "that's what the chart told them to do"), then TA is just another tool at the big players' disposal.

"One reason" that government should be involved is one too many. The whole point of Bitcoin is to avoid regulation. It's right there in the gat dang white paper.
