That's what it was for me, too.
@_date: 2012-12-13 18:53:48
Thanks. Hopefully someone in the community has some answers or ideas.
@_date: 2012-12-12 19:01:21
[I started a thread]( on bitcointalk.com... hopefully someone there knows his whereabouts.
@_date: 2012-12-13 21:13:06
Yes, I did send them both a message. Thanks for the help. I hope I can recover those bitcoins!
@_date: 2012-12-11 23:26:28
I actually forgot about them... yeah yeah, I know.
I found some transaction emails doing a search in my gmail account for 'bitcoin'. Better late than never, I suppose.
@_date: 2012-12-13 19:53:55
I'm sending Mahkul a message in hopes that it leads somewhere. Thanks for the great reply!
Edit: He's the wrong guy. He owned BitMarket, not BitcoinMarket. The search continues.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:07:28
I'm now looking through my list of allowed 'NoScript' sites, since I used that add-on quite often back in 2011.
Bad news... I have tradehill.com and bitcoinMarket.com on my allowed list. Those are both sites where I have no chance of rescuing my coins, correct?
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:51:53
I really do think it could have been... but I have no way of verifying that, do I?
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:17:29
I just got them today!
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:28:03
No offense, but if you can't find this out through some basic searching then Bitcoin probably isn't for you.
That being said, there are MANY resources on this forum that can answer your question without having someone type out a detailed instruction manual made just for you. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:27:20
I don't think so... I hadn't heard of Bitcoinica until you mentioned it.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:06:53
I definitely did move them myself... I remember doing it. Why do you say that they are certainly no longer at that address?
I have them shown in the withdrawal history on my Mt.Gox account. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:18:49
No it definitely want one of those. 
Thanks for trying though.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:04:13
Does anyone know if adding another comment brings a post 'to the top' as with other forums?
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:28:37
"User does not exist" error when I try my only bitcoin email address.
Thanks for checking.
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:19:07
You have any other way to contact Jered besides claim
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:36:36
Yeah, that was the first thing I did. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:08:49
Does this mean that every day (with 20K new subscribers a day) we should expect a similar situation? I almost felt better knowing it was a DDOS attack!
Now we hope MtGox can get their shit together, that the growing number of new accounts won't cause another lag induced sell-a-thon, and wait for the price to bounce back up.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:19:09
no thank goodness... that site was hacked I think.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:47:12
He didn't reply to those email addresses or phone number back in February when I first tried to locate him. I'll try again.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:37:12
I've emailed claim
We'll see where it gets me.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:03:27
Yeah that was one of the first things I tried. It's been discussed a few times in this thread. Thanks for offering a suggestion tho.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:13:45
Extremely interesting... Thanks for the share. Think the community can learn from this and protect itself? We should share things like this with everyone.
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:14:15
Did that website have a blue motif with multiple tickers?
For some reason, that is the color scheme and design that is sticking in my head.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:02:07
Indeed, you are correct. This is some awesome sleuthing!
I was also tracking that while reddit was down for the past few minutes. It's interesting... where does that put us right now?
Are we sure that 1KQM6trPRWU3gyywDwoQoHTvjEYpfq9GSs belongs to me? I'm wondering why not all my coins would be at that address, and how I can claim it.
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:02:30
While I see where you're coming from and did consider posting in that forum, I figured that the problems of Bitcoin-24 are already known.
I just wanted to ask the general public if they are experiencing problems similar to mine and what they did to rectify the situation (if they could).
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:34:11
Can you link to this email?
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:16:12
I tried to withdraw my bitcoins and have not seen them yet. Now my balance is zero... what gives? Has anyone else received the bitcoins they transferred out of their bitcoin-24 account?
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:26:55
With 20K new accounts being added every day, it's not going down. Those people are waiting to get in and buy. They've seen how high it went, and they want to see it get there again.
Also, the more times these things happen on an exchange, the less it will phase the market. People will just know what's going on and wait. That's my thoughts at least.
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:16:43
I have yet to receive an response from my email to Tradehill... 
If you know how to reach Dustin Dollar from bitcoin market, you can see if he can dig further. Trying myself didn't get me anywhere with him. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:32:41
I hate everything right now. If it's not one thing, it's another.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:18:22
Tried all of those. Nothing useful in the transfer confirmation either.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:51:35
It's just giving me multiple errors when I search the address (or any address).
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:55:22
Same here... withdrew my BTC on the 29th at 4pm CST... still nothing. I opened a ticket and no response yet.
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:59:48
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:26:03
"Information is unavailable"
Thanks for trying though!
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:26:45
Ahh I wish I had more money to buy in!!! 
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:05:04
None are available. That was listed in my "Things I have attempted"
I have signups from dwolla, mtgox, and bitcoinmarket.
I still feel like it was bitcoinmarket, but the site is different that I remember. I also don't see any bitcoins in my account there... and it's been inactive for a long time.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:15:49
United States
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:04:38
Called Tradehill, and some guy picked up with a "Hello?" Like it was his personal line.
"Ummm... is this Tradehill?"
"Yep. I'm the CEO"
Explained my problem, he explained they are a totally different company, with a totally different database and no access to my account info. But if I email claim  from the email address I signed up with, I might be able to recover the funds (If they exist).
Forming email now.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:50:59
I made my BTC withdrawl on April 29, and have yet to see the coins.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:16:19
I've definitely wiped my search history since then...
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:37:17
I don't use twitter.... but like I said, there's a nice reward to whoever gets him in contact with me. I also tried info
Edit: I've just called again and spoke with their CEO, Ryan (Forgot last name). He confirmed that the old tradehill was a separate entity and the current one does not have access to the funds being claimed from that account. I will be resending my Tradehill information to claim and CC him on the messages. We'll see where this gets me.
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:00:52
As of right now, If this locates them, emesto will get the reward.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:23:12
Yes, but it's a desolate place. I show my account having no bitcoins.
I have a transaction history there of with an ID of 20793. Date: 2011-06-02 @ 09:35:33. All numbers are zero (fees, amount), Processor is "BM", and Memo is "Initial".
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:35:23
Just looking at the list, none really do. I'll have to go through each one and try my email address to see if it registers. This was before the wide use of wallet.dat files, so I kept all my coins online.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:30:53
Make sure you have a volume override option so the alarm can sound regardless of sound setting that can easily be turned on and off 
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:17:11
I just got them today!
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:57:54
I see that, too... Maybe that is the address we should be trying to find?
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:49:45
That was the address of another exchange. I was basically just 'keeping them there'. I have no idea why... don't judge me. I didn't understand the concept of wallets at the time, and thought they would be safer than keeping them on a flash drive that could get lost. I put too much faith in the 'cloud'.
Right now, this is the biggest lead we've got. I'm interested in pursuing this further, because nobody has indicated this in the past. I only remember moving them out of Mt.Gox... so I'm curious is my memory is even worse than I thought, or if they were removed by the exchange site.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:42:51
I haven't received mine yet... it's been almost a week
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:36:42
I hope so...
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:52:25
As of right now I'm trying to locate Jered from Tradehill. I'm not having much luck getting a response from him, but I heard he's pretty busy. I also sent him a message on bitcointalk, so we'll see. If anyone has some assistance they can offer, it's appreciated.
He could be following [this thread]( but I can't post a reply there. My account might not have enough posts. If someone can get his attention to this thread, it would possibly help.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:18:33
I'll definitely look into it
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:51:34
Same here... open ticket, unassigned, and no response.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:20:00
How do you think that? I have record of withdrawing my coins out of Mt.Gox and into the account above. That was the last time they were touched.
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:17:05
Did they? I still don't see the coins I withdrew.
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:54:55
Nothing here either... created ticket and no response. 11.5 coins in limbo somewhere...
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:39:11
I have tried that... by following the block chain we can see that it was withdrawn from my bitcoin account to 1NC7smnWpxe1w5R9y9rrStGGZhPh5QkYJA on August 19th 2011. From there it was transferred to 1LnArZXAJuZWzPjtP6NZUYLd8hjHUA5UDD. After that it gets lost, as there's no way to track it.
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:23:31
Nope, definitely not that. The one I'm thinking of had tickers in the upper right side of the screen... The sad part is that I might not even be thinking of the right one! Also, the site could have been updated since August 2011.
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:52:20
Still waiting on my bitcoins to be returned. I initiated the withdraw on April 29th, then sent a message to the law firm on May 17th... we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:18:13
I'm still waiting... nothing yet.
Withdraw was initialized on Apr 29, 2013 at 4:07 PM CST
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:16:07
Coins were returned this morning. Email notification from the law firm asking for confirmation.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:38:29
I never received the coins I withdrew... it's been a week already. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:23:54
Yes, they aren't it.
