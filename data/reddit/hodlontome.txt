A ponzi scheme owes people money, bitcoin doesn’t owe you anything :)

Usually a confirmation takes 10 minutes to confirm, the exchange i use only credits your account with 3 confirmations on the network. But sometimes it can take hours, for instance when btrash was stealing hashpower from btc.. we had well over 100k unconfirmed transactions back then. It also depends on the fee you are willing to pay high fees will make your transaction a priority

Me too, i feel bad for the people that understand and believe in the tech, but can’t invest because they live paycheck to paycheck:(

In my opinion they make the same mistake everyone else is making.. they compare bitcoin with bubbles from the past or stocks. They can’t wrap their head around the concept. This might be history in the making haha

I just turned 20 so i guess that’s young enough.. and i also see banks and governments as the biggest threat to bitcoin. I’ve been reading about bitcoin since 2015, i saw it go up but never had the money to invest so i forgot about it. In september i got a full time job which pays me well. I guess i’m trying to catch up because i spend so much time on the sidelines
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:25:00
Is there even demand for young male ass?
