According to my scientific analysis, it's 91.3%.

Core tries to adhere to IETF's [rough consensus]( decision making process.

Few of them do.

UASF - Let's do it.

Like the exchanges refusing to list BU as BTC? And the fact that 80%+ of nodes run Core? That's an important detail. If the miners stage a coup, that will force the economic majority to change the PoW function.

 &gt; When it comes to proposals by Blockstream, yes, to a certaint extent it has. 
I'm so tired of hearing this fucking lie. Blockstream isn't Core and Core isn't blockstream. Core is a development community open to anyone. It follows opensource development principles. This subreddit gets criticized for toxicity but it's B.S. like this that gets us so pissed off.

You're also saying yes to the biggest middeman in the system, Jihan Wu, controlling the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:18:10
Yes, Jihan Eu has been saying that he would like to see emergent consensus handle more parameters than just the block size! Hmm I wonder what other consensus parameters a miner would like to be able to control with his oligarch buddies?

It's ridiculous how thin-skinned some of you people are.

I disagree that ETH is maybe even more impressive... it basically got to ride Bitcoin's coat tails. 
Bitcoin had to do the heavy lifting of proving the concept of a distributed ledger with a built-in token. Bitcoin was ridiculed right from the beginning as being untenable. Bitcoin has survived all kinds of disasters and events that called into question its very future. And all of that happened *before* Ethereum came along.
Against all odds, Bitcoin has grown to an $18B market cap from ZERO. Ethereum started out of the gate with a massive community investment from Bitcoiners.
Bitcoin is *by far* the more impressive "startup".

Even you could join the Core project and add your voice. It's an opensource project that uses consensus to merge changes.

Keep burying your head in the sand!

You're not seeing this clearly. The exchanges haven't said that it's all about mere hashpower - they're going to see if one chain ends up being absolutely dominant in terms of nodes and market cap and maybe some other type of gut assessment. 
I assure you that if the miners try to stage a coup with 70% hashpower, the exchanges will not bend over and nor will the economic majority. 


Satoshi said **nothing** about breakaway projects that change the consensus rules attempting to steal the Bitcoin name without overwhelming consensus. 
And seriously, 70% hashpower is not nearly enough even to be morally defensible.

Well if Bitfury does that, it all but guarantees a PoW function change.

Flexcap = gamed block sizes. It's DOA.
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:44:22
I grow wary of the miners. I say we fire them by switching the hash algorithm.
