But doesn't focusing on the reviewers further enforce the status quo (which is bad)? I don't really get why that's a substitute?

How is a bad review isn't corruption, though? It seems like that's just an editorial decision you dislike.

All reviews are opinion pieces. That's the whole point of a review. To get someone else's opinion on a piece of media before you consume it. The score should reflect that person's cumulative take on the piece. I'm not seeing the problem here. There isn't any objectivity in any game review. Not focusing on a particular aspect of the game (in this case the hypersexualization of a character) is a choice a reviewer makes. Just because it's the choice you would make doesn't make it an objective review.

It seems to me that an "under the radar partnership" is something gamergate would be vehemently against if someone on the other side did it.

Wouldn't that mean you should try to get the studios to reform their payment practices instead of encouraging only good reviews?

So you want to have reviewers change what they write because of articles whose conclusion you disagree with that other people wrote? This all just seems like a huge step back for gaming to me. I worked so hard convincing my parents that games are art. Part of being art is you get a different level of criticism and that's okay! We as gamers should be able to respond to criticism in ways that aren't freaking the fuck out and trying to censor those writers.

I guess I just haven't seen much of that compared to a whole lot of stuff focusing on the reviewers themselves changing their practices.
