I’d rather be rich. I don’t give a shit about corruption as long as I have money
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:01:04
Relax, lmao
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:09:08
What the fuck? Why would you go on the internet and tell people you have a shitload of money
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:07:18
College has been the best years of my life, and I paid for tuition with money I made in high school.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:27:23
With other exchanges of course 
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:23:04
New around here. Goxxxed?
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:17:26
That's the age when people are legally allowed to work...
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:29:23
It reads like a shitty high school paper

A bitcoin exchange gone bad...sounds like reason to worry about future issues?
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:21:16
I sure did
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:11:12
Yes this is dog is classic

You can’t say what it’s about
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:57:57
Learn his secret!
BTC holders HATE him!
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:34:51
That’ll getcha laid

@_date: 2017-09-14 21:19:37
I don't think that's gonna matter if it goes up in the future. You a dick, yo.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:02:10
English might not be her first language
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:23:14
Sounds like a great friend you have where they get enjoyment out of you losing your investment, albeit temporarily (but that's not what he thinks)
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:00:43
Your mom might have a point
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:14:52
Wow thanks for saying the same shit again but with a lame analogy. It’s still a technicality.

@_date: 2017-10-07 11:43:52
Is it?
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:28:09
I need to stay subscribed bc sometimes there are worthwhile updates, meanwhile I have to look at this shlop
And I’m gonna comment whether you like it or not buddy
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:42:30
No, I bought at 5k, I'm just upset bc I'm a quadriplegic.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:40:03
Repost, who cares? A copied piece of shit still started out as a piece of shit
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:11:19
Shut that mouth before I kiss it
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:32:06
how am I supposed to now
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:08:33
Sorry I’m not using your preferred vernacular, Ledditor. Vent your frustrations if you must
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:30:17
I’ll try and hate fewer things in order to get my user ranking back up
@_date: 2018-04-14 13:23:50
This is the worst subreddit ever
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:02:56
I definitely feel like the comic book guy would be crypto-obsessed
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:00:50
They’re not mutually exclusive. You people defend this subreddit like I’m insulting a person!
