Use Sentinel if you’re that desperate to see a fiat value for your BTC. Otherwise there’s no reason to not use Samourai.

Not at all. That ~0.1 may be a sum larger than you and I transact in a single tx but certainly not something you should expect others to.

There’s nothing realistic about trying to force whatever payment you need to do made up of approximate 0.1 UTXOs. 
Coinjoins need pools with different denominations and solid post mix tools once mixing has been done to spend.

1) Can’t see that on iOS though?

LND Thin Wallet is the only one for mainnet at the moment. Coinomi is a decent choice for Segwit.

Can use Coinomi but it’s a centralised coin anyway so you’re not mitigating your risks to any meaningful extent.

U.K. Revolut to itBit also works. Just use your EUR account to SEPA the money there.

Seed paths seem compatible but it wasn't obvious.

What derivation path should I use to restore the new Bech32 p2wpkh wallet in Electrum?
For the legacy (p2pkh) I would select the BIP39 option and specify m/0' in derivation path on the next screen.

For the [iancoleman.io]( site, it seems to be m/0'/0 for BIP 141 and p2wpkh

Tangem cards are similar but not as trustless.

You friend is comparing apples with oranges - no pun intended.

bitWallet is solid. Has Segwit too. No multisig but not so necessary on a mobile client.

You can, of course, use hardware wallets with Electrum.
