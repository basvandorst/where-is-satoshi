My story didn't end this way... Terrible customer service.

I've occasionally perused the site, this is excellent news for working ladies everywhere.

i ordered on the 25th, coins are out of my wallet and they claim they dont have them. when i called customer support, i was told to "call bitcoin". theres no way i can explain to this poor guy answering phones how bitcoin works in 5 minutes. i have a total of 2 days, 10 phone calls, 10 emails, to both tiger direct and bitpay, and it doesnt look like anyone has a fucking clue. not a good start at all.
My update: I got a refund from Bitpay. Tiger Direct was no help at all, they actually emailed me today (7 days since order) finally suggesting i contact bitpay... i got a refund from them yesterday by reddit stalking an employee. I really hope they fix their issues, because this should be a good thing, but Tiger Direct lost a customer this week due to the horrible customer service i received, and the not-ready-yet implementation of the payment process, and Im a little weary of Bitpay, although grateful for the refund. I ordered my power supply from amazon with USD.

As someone that's had a slow resolved bitpay issue in the past, bravo.

so far the bitcoin payment system is sucking.... you guys need to get atleast a couple knowledgable folks on the phone to help with the issues.

Ordered from tiger direct on Saturday. Order tracking shows unpaid but coins are gone and phone calls don't help. Not a good start.
