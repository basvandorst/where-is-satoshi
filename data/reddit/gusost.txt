I see that one of the outputs is a segwit address while none of the inputs are.
Heres to you if you are making sure your change goes to a segwit address. Hope you had no choice with the other output.

Sent my monies to a personal account in France (Karpeles own?). Told no one in case it was a scam. Didn’t want to hear ppl say “What did you think was gonna happen!?”. That part actually worked fine except for the part that the time it took made BTC go from $4,50 at deposit time to $17 when I got access and bought BTC.
Shortly after, it reached $35 and then my first opportunity to hodl when it crashed down to $2-something.

Which no one is suggesting they do.
They would start generating segwit addresses for change outputs and new coins coming in. Not moving anything just because. Therefor only reducing cost and not straining the block chain with unnecessary transactions.

From what I read moving from a non-segwit address to a segwit address is not a segwit transaction.
While the opposite is.

What world are you living in?
Anything can happen. -6% as the lowest option and +260% as the highest is just skewed.
Don't get me wrong I think the price is some sort of health meter for bitcoin so I want it to go up. It's just your options are overly optimistic.
I would say around $5k and then turning up again in summer 2019.

Isn't the thing that you did not "come up" with that day but that is what the data shows?
Extrapolating like this is bullshit. Even though it's worked in the past. It's just p-hacking. Look at enough things you can find extraordinary patterns. Even if those are coincidental.

How can it be a soft fork? Old clients will not be able to verify TXs where the fractions have been changed.
Soft forks are only hardening or limiting previous rules (so old clients can still play along). Expansion, relaxation or adding of new rules makes a hard fork.

Think, yes. Know for certain, no.
Coinbase is such a large operation that I doubt they would put a green check mark if it wasn’t ok. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:37:27
Ah, yes. But even there things do not cost fractions of a cent. 
It's just that they afford much less. And they will also have to have some sort device to be able to use an electronic payment system. That will also be tough on such a limited budget. 
I feel you may be doing a bit of reductio ad absurdum.

Well, no. Sending FROM a segwit addr is the thing making the tx cheaper. Destination is irrelevant.

Cause and effect.
Is it related? Always hard to tell with Bitcoin.
When China finally effectively shutdown their trades people thought it was going to be the end. Turned out it was just a minor speed bump. There is so much nervous money and greed in Bitcoin that it is really hard to see what causes what.

5 min on average.
10min between blocks you are equally likely to wait 0min as 10min.
Average (10 - 0) / 2 = 5 min.
The math can be made more complex but simplified this is good enough.

What about batching? That will save even more precious block space! This is of course good as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:35:48
Not sure if you're trolling me or not...
Anyway, I have five years of university math under my belt.
9 minutes if the hashing power goes up, as you say, yes. It doesn't always go up. But, for now, let's say it does and the average time is 9 min.


I'm not assuming. They're not. I was simplifying. Because on average they are. Finding a new block has a certain probability for each hash a miner performs. Importantly, an equal probability for each hash, given a certain difficulty. This makes finding a block follow the same rules as finding out nuclear decay probabilities and it follows the Poisson distribution.
I wish I could find a simpler article to explain it but here is the wiki: 
We can liken this with catching a train (finding a block). On average there is 9 min between the trains. In truth, never exactly 9 minutes. sometimes 1 min, sometimes as you say 60 min.
Now if you were to measure the time between lets say 510285 trains you might find it took 4803840 minutes ≈ 9min 25sec.
There for the average is just that. To simplify what to expect, let's see how long we would have to wait to catch a train if we walked down to the train station at a random time a few hundred billion times to let good and bad luck even out. Sometimes we would come down right before a train leaves and sometimes we just barely miss the train. The average of this would be, trust me on this, half of the average time between trains. 4min and 12.5 sec in this case.
Sorry for being sloppy in my original comment.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:45:38
No, it's not necessary. We all choose what we are willing to pay.
Like tipping for beer in the US. Went to many different bars, left $1 tip independent of the price for beer. Did not need fractions. Sure, added up it may be a lot but as long as you have a resonable resolution in the choosing of the transaction fee it's gonna be fine.

Well, people will leave those banks that do not provide the services for which they were intended in the first place.
What good is a money transferring service without the ability to transfer money where I want. 
Other banks will emerge to fill the service gap in the market.
Supply and demand dictates this.
Banks are entitled to block illegal transfers, not to block transfers that could be illegal because of origin or race... uhm, I mean currency! 
That's racism applied to economics.
