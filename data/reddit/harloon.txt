My comic and game store has been accepting bitcoin since last thanksgiving.  We accept bitcoin anyway you can send it to me.  I have found customers scanning my blockchain wallet address the easiest.We do a few hundred in sales a month in bitcoin.  At that rate I don't need to convert to fiat so I just transfer it to a cold wallet.Every customer has been legit so far.  We really only do face to face transactions so that helps.

I accept Bitcoins at my FLGS, [Rooks Comics and Games](  I don't convert to fiat although if a significant amount of business happened in Bitcoin I might have to.
Any business accepting Bitcoins is a plus but I do agree getting more Bitcoin only loops would be nice.  If my game distributors accepted Bitcoins I likely would not have to convert to fiat even if Bitcoin became a major part of my business.

I love new store accepting Bitcoins but  I just want to point out we have been accepting Bitcoins for about a month now at Rooks Comics and Games.
I also doubt that we were the first either. Its awesome they are accepting Bitcoins but the article hypes it up a little too much.

First, don't hate on windows  phones.  I have been a huge fan of Android phones and I find I like my windows phone better.Second, the best thing I have found so far is rushwallet.  It is really just a webpage that acts like a wallet but I have had .25 btc on it since August and they are still there.  Just don't delete the bookmark from your windows phone or you will lose your coins.There was a reddit discussion if it in august you can search for easily.

Hopefully somebody can help me out.  I used this service to make an account and logged into it on my windows phone.  However, it is now saying there are no wallets associated with that account.  The wallet was not a multisig.  I did not delete any profiles.  I still know my password and can successfully log into the app.  Is there any way to get access to those coins?

Sorry to hear of your bad experience.  I own a card/game shop and accept Bitcoins if you want to buy those types of products in the future.  We participated in Bitcoin Black Friday and it was great.

The website is [Rook's Comics and Games](  I have a few things up in an online store but not magic singles.  We do have our singles online it is just in a different cart system.  
I have both coinbase and bitpay accounts so I can send email invoices for stuff that is not on the online cart.

Haha, there is some humor in that.  As long as the minimum order was say, over $10 i would do free shipping to the east coast.  
We actually have our magic singles online so anyone can see our exact inventory for that.

I have found purchasing with bitcoin very easy.  I bought some bitcoin stickers.  I put in my address, hit order and a QR code popped up on my laptop.  Scanned that with my bitcoin wallet and bam, payment confirmed.  Didn't have to put in my credit card info and no info saved by the site that could get hacked later.
Also, try Gyft.  You put in the amount you want for the gift card and hit buy.  Your wallet app will open and ask to confirm.  Simple as that, literally two clicks.
I would say it is much better than cash, about the same as a credit card but I like that the store doesn't have my payment info. 
I also accept bitcoins at my business and have run one physical transaction so far.  It took the same time or slightly less than running a credit card.
