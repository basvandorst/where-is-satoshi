He should follow his own advice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:28
Make sure it's named.  wallet.dat
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:14:18
There's no way I can remember my password so that's why it has to be written/typed and stored somewhere away from my wallet. Just don't forget where you stored your password at lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:22:53
Cool idea but you can just download free bitcoin ticker widget for your phone and pull up a list of whatever exchange you want to see...now if someone didn't have a smart phone I could see a use for it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:08:19
1 million a coin, hopefully in 3 years lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:11:24
Don't listen to them. Mine If you want to if you can afford your electric bill to be more. Even though I only am getting about $4 a day, all those coins go into storage and years later down the road will pay more than what you spent on electricity.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:16:06
How is that possible,  the end happend back in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and now 2016?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:53:53
I withdrew from gdax to my wallet and it took about 12 hours
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:41:16
Yes, all my stuff has passwords but I never had to enter any of them bc I wasn't sending coins. I just re download each newest wallet from their websites. I only did a few, litecoin, primecoin, peercoin, namecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:36:03
Should have sent to gdax and buy more bitcoin lol. (Joking)
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:25
Last Friday everyone at work said I was crazy buying in at 10,500...now they all asking me how-to get started haha.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:34:36
Plenty of people know but who cares. That's the past,  let's look toward the future and n how much it will be then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:59
Coinbase is a joke, everytime it hits an ATH it goes down, now when it drops big time they go down also? I wish Gemini would step up their dam game. It shouldn't take forever to get verified.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:55
Can't wait to read the Bitcoin horror news stories tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:49:19
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:17
I don't understand what is the point of that trezor? It's basically just a usb stick right? Why does it cost so much bc you can lock it with a password ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:29:40
lol no way. We will never see $1 bitcoins again. I doubt we ever see it under $5000
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:06:44
Awesome,  u won't mind hooking me up with 1 btc for the help then?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:18:23
Lol. Well now you know not to make the same mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:21:01
Coinbase/gdax ruined the momentum that was happening.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:40:08
Prob so
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:01:24
If all the internet access the world would shut down.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:57
The longest bubble in history huh. Almost 9 years now, still waiting for it to pop.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:47:24
Isint that what Litecoin is?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:22:30
End of the week I'm thinking it will. I like how it's staying steady around 11,500
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:54:37
Yes stealing would be wrong but if he had family members(that he cared about) you could also  help them out by finding those coins and I'm sure they would appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:03:49
I lost about 5 btc thanks to the jackasses at Mintpal exchange, but I learned a lesson never to hold most my coins in an exchange after that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:36:10
Can someone list me some other kinds of coins that have tried to take over bitcoin before ? I have heard people talk about this isint the first time happening so I'd like to go read up in the others who have failed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:29:13
Wow, like talking to a brick wall..you completely missed the whole point of what I said..
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:01:31
It's possible, hope it works out for you. I've recovered photos before like that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:17:26
Ah ok
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:41:52
Ah ok thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:02
Memba Minpal 2.0, ahhhhhh, iii remembaaa
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:55
Price is going to drop with coin base down like this 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:30:17
Lol wow, I would go insane looking at the price all over my house all the time  haha. I'm already bad enough checking my phone all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:17:39
I believe when u load the wallet,  even if it's locked, you will still show the balance or at least see all the transactions that happend inside. I recently just loaded about 5 different alt coins wallet.dat that I kept from many years ago just to make sure I didn't have any coins left and every one showed how many coins I had, once the block chains all got up to date, I had no coins left bc I sent them and sold them but it showed every transactions still that I had made.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:07:34
Whatever man. Have fun downloading the entire blockchain. I've never stolen anything in my life and wouldn't steal your coins. I was just offering help.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:14:25
The only thing you are waiting on is the coin to show up to your coinbase account..once you buy in at say 13,000, your done. If you plan on holding buy in now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:27:29
Well even if you wanted to buy on the dip you couldn't b/c even gdax wasn't really working. My co worker was desperately trying to get into coinbase to send money to gdax but it was also down.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:52:28
From Gdax to my wallet yesterday, it literally took all night. About 12 hours. It was fine when I woke up and checked my wallet this morning.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:55:27
By the time it hits that,  we will all be dead lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:22:41
Besides the b.s. that just happend with coinbase...don't forget the past few weeks everytime bitcoin was about to hit 20,000, gdax / coinbase goes down for maintenance causing the price of bitcoin to drop. Ya they have a lot of volume but 2 times in a row when btc is reaching a high point, it gets overloaded? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:15:29
Guess I was wrong Lol, 12k surpassed, 13k bye the end of the week??? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:11
Wow thanks,  16,800 , didn't think I'd get more at that price ever again.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:44:51
I feel your pain. I tried getting my dad to loan me $5000 when the price was around $800 in 2013, he laughed at me and said you aren't buying anything, it's not backed by anything blah blah blah. Well the other day he sees a article about the price hitting 10k and asks me if I still messed with bitcoin and I said not like I use to but I am buying more now. I then asked again if he would loan me 5000 and I could buy half a coin and hold it and once again,  he laughs at me and says it's to late now to get in, the bubble will pop etc. I just laughed back and said watch in about 3-5 years how much the price will be and you are going to wish you listened to me this time. I can't wait to tell him, I TOLD YOU SO!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:33:59
Why would you close it? Unless you need that money now there is no point I'm which you prob shouldn't have invested that much to begin with.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:44:26
Ah gotcha
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:00:25
Everything is backed up. It took me 12 hours to transfer yesterday with the min. Fee...those coins should be fine as long as you transferred to the correct address.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:57
Ya I know so why does this one cost like 100 bux when you can just lock it yourself?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:20:30
Coinbase and gdax got overloaded and shut down for a while. The price dropped bc of that. I bet if it didn't go down we would prob have hit 20k easly
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:58:58
Lol same here but just wait a week or so, we should hopefully get back close to 20k
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:43:17
Maybe ask family members where he stored personal prized possessions. But if he was smart, he wouldn't have written his password and kept it in the same place so you will need to find that also unless you can guess what you think it would be.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:37:06
I just started mining after dabbling in it back around 2013. I am doing it straight from nicehash now. I have my gaming computer with a gtx 1080 and I7 cpu and it estimates that i will get around $3-3.50 a day. I also am using a laptop that does cpu only mining giving me .30 cents a day and another older i7 computer mining cpu only saying about .45 cents a total. Total estimate is from $100 -150 a month. I'm sure my electricity bill will go up some but I'm not worried about that. If I can mine $1200 of bitcoin a year just running these computers, I'm perfectly fine with that. I am thinking of adding a gtx 1070 to my older computer though which would prob help about an extra $2 a day
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:41:10
Well this is a new one, looking for past coins 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:35:04
Yep, screw that bank, get a new one. Why should they tell you what you can and cannot buy?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:04:01
Ah ok, that makes sense. I guess I'm just old fashioned and will stick with my couple of usb drives in one location and passwords in another location.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:14
I was going to switch to Gemini but they don't have my bank listed. Now I have to send a wire transfer just to get verified? How come coinbase didn't have this requirement? Also how long does the id verification take?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:30:32
It's the original coin. Just like an original painting from a famous painter. If you had a choice of a copy or the actual painting for free,  most people will take the orignal.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:03:20
One of them is mine from years ago when I sold at $400....smh...
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:38:13
Just pay the taxes. You won't get away with it,.plus you make bitcoin look even worse doing that. It took a long time to get away from the whole bitcoin is only for the dark web /illegal purchase stigma. People still believe that today. Yes it's used for that but so is regular money used for the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:47:48
What are you talking about? Everytime we hit ATH at coinbase, the website goes down. Everytime they hit a low, the website goes down. I'm not talking about the price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:27:39
Then you are blind or need glasses really bad. Go try to purchase something off coinbase right now..oh wait you can't. Try to sell next time btc reaches around 20,000..oh wait you won't be able to bc the site will go down again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:14
Do it now. I said the same thing to myself earlier this summer when it was at 3000, I said oh it's too late now, the price is to high. Well I finally dove in last Friday and it hasn't even been a week and I almost doubled my money. I plan on holding for a few years. I learned my lesson selling everything I had back in 2013, I won't fall for it again 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:37:39
The U.S. will just be shooting themselves in the foot when other countries like Japan already legalized btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:22
Lol same here.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:15:12
Oh ok
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:03:51
I've thought about it a few times over the years as I seen the price rise over 1k and it pretty much killed my enthusiasm for BTC. I am now just getting back into the game last month after seeing the crazy price increases these past few months. I can't change the past and what happend, but ive decided to buy back in hoping to change my future...just this time all my BTC is staying offline now lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:37:30
I think it could but it prob won't be for 10+ years 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:08:47
The more the news covers it, the more people want to get on board. That's one reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:07:05
Lol would be nice  but we gained 5000 in one week. One week! That's insane enough. The crap that happend yesterday was just plain ridiculous. Don't expect something like that to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:36:19
Ah ok. I never messed with android wallets, always stayed with the original core
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:13:06
ya, kind of like your face
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:17:39
Have you signed up at gdax? Its easy to transfer your btc to your gdax account, then withdraw to your wallet with no fee
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:52:30
Nope, bye bye coins. Chalk it up as a lesson, back up all wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:22:38
Thats crazy how if just gdax or coinbaase go down(or both) how much the price drops. Is coinbase the biggest exchange in the U.S?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:28:07
10,000 in one week is not normal lol. There has to be a correction eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:44:46
I don't really understand the whole futures thing. If they technically aren't buying bitcoins, can't they just buy a future for price point of say 20,000 and then they all just go buy a bunch of bitcoins themselves to raise the price to 20,000 where they can make double?
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:57:22
I'll stick with only natural herb, no tobacco here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:32:43
They are a joke. I mined on their when nicehash went down, said I only get 1-$3 a day when my 3 computers should be getting around 5-6 a day
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:24:56
Jesus Christ, I wake up and we almost hit 13k?! This is crazy awesome lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:53:46
Welcome to bitcoin lol. I bet almost everyone has taken lick at certain points of the game if your whole point is to make money really fast. Your better off saving those coins and come back to it in 2 years
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:37:01
Why would you ruin a nice blunt/joint like that and mix it with tobacco? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:36:00
Ya, no thanks. Holding all those coins in one wallet so it gets "hacked" was incredibly stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:51:45
Ya, I can't wait to see what happens. If it drops, I'm buying more, if it goes up, I'm making more money lol.so it's also a win win
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:31
I'm not a scammer. I'll even post the link of me sending him his money to the address he requested.
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:06:10
Ya I still use the same email address,  just cant remember the mt gox password to save my life 
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:29:34
Is there a way to recover your password if you domt remember it from mtgox? Pretty sure I have nothing in there still but you never know
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:47:41
So does that mean coinbase pro wont magically stop working when Btc reaches up to ATH again ?
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:31:16
That's the thing...I've done deleted emails from way back then...I thought maybe the user name would have been your email address. I have no idea what my user name would have been. Oh well. Pretty sure I didnt have anything left on there anyways.
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:18:57
If your talking about Coinbase, all you do is go on their exchange site, coinbase pro, and just buy Btc-USD. Then the bitcoin goes into your BTC wallet
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:43:44
Sell now and regret it years down the road big time. Been there, done that.
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:14:31
Well that's how i was buying my bitcoin. Using a credit card, getting the points back, paying off the credit card the next month,  start over. Sure I have the money to buy bitcoin if I wanted to so why not get extr a money back by using a credit card when it's the same thing? Now maxing out your CC on btc and getting in debt, ya, that's not good
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:53:02
Nope, everyone in my family has already said I'm wasting money into "fake" money so they get nothing.
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:24:45
As of now, I wouldn't care if they just vanished lol. Now maybe in the future something will change and I'll make preparations for it.
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:23:46
Lol, now that you mention that, I think your right. Forgot how much coinbase fee was.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:51:44
Easy to hodl when you are already rich 
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:59:45
Yep, pretty much all wallets back then saved as wallet.dat file
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:47:49
Can I buy bitcoin with the card and not be charged cash advance? If so, I'm in.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:52:21
How is this possible? I thought the bubble burst?
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:09:02
Same way I do now, wallet file on usb. Well actually back in 2010 I had mine stored on a burned CD. Everything had passwords that were saved somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:46:12
Lol dang, that's a candle
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:32:44
Dumb. Just helping coinbase corner the market even more
