Yeah buddy, me too. Great feeling.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:32:46
I understand the concept, this is literally the first btc I purchased. I realize I have a lot to learn.

You can use a VISA credit card as your backup, that's what I used.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:05:17
Coinbase. You won't be able to make the instant purchases without a credit card as backup though (i.e. you'll have to wait a few days after making the buy until you receive bitcoin).

I would interested in getting a refurbished laptop this way, but I only have a little more that 1.5 btc to my name.  I'm expecting the value to rise in the future and currently do not have much liquidity for btc. I have made a few small purchases/donation just to try it out however.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:02:12
Great website. Once my first coin comes through I will make a donation.
@_date: 2014-09-19 08:54:59
Well it just dipped below 400 and quickly bounced back above.

I was too lazy to scan mine for Gox, went with Coinbase instead. Whew.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:46:06
Sorry man, I can't even imagine.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:37:13
I just bought my first coin using Coinbase, and one of the draws for me is that it claims to be a wallet.  I understand that Coinbase could be a target for thieves like Gox was, but isn't it significantly more protected?  I have a lot of research to do to get my btc offline and into a wallet on an external drive.

Fuck, don't tell Al Gore.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:49:55
I agree, the hearing Congress had on bitcoin a few weeks ago was remarkably open-minded/mildly positive. We'll see if that lasts.
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:01:50
How do you pay rent or mortgage?
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:36:57
Thanks for the response. I have been following the movement for a few months and this is my first purchase. Followed a friends advice for a reputable exchange to purchase btc.  I realize the risks associated with keeping it in third party control, just very new to the technology/security needed for personal storage.
@_date: 2014-10-02 02:54:49
Smoke it if you got it
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:52:59
Yeah I thought $630 was a great deal.  This kind of blind optimism is not helpful.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:07:37
Yeah, and I think it is better the bitcoin gets back on the market rather than a large corporation holding a bunch.
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:40:03
Good way to look at it. I convinced my brother to get in yesterday at 395.  If only I had waited, but 625 seemed like a great deal at the time.  Still buying though.
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:31:55
Close to breaking even now!

More noobs, more money going into bitcoin. Worth answering a few questions.
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:47:35
Absolutely. If bitcoin is ever going to be adopted widely we need these services.  It seems like a lot of the people preaching about being your own bank are PC master race types.  At this point it is far too complicated for the average person.  I have had no issues with Coinbase and keep the majority of my BTC in the vault.
@_date: 2014-04-16 23:47:16
He should allow Virgin Mobile to accept bitcoin for cell phone bills, that would be quite a leap forward.
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:21:31
Agreed, I love the upward trend, just hoping it doesn't move too fast because I want to buy more cheap coin. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:30:11
This was my first transaction with bitcoin. They are a great source of information, been reading trip reports for 10 years now.  Enjoying some kratom in my juice as a toast to Erowid. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:44:10
$1.29 currently, assume you sold it off long ago?
@_date: 2014-07-30 02:59:23
Wells Fargo sucks, I haven't had any issues with Coinbase from my credit union. You should check out the CUs in your area.  
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:20:09
Wow, thanks for the perspective.  At least buying it is cheap, just like gasoline.
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:30:35
I use bitcoin to pay back friends instantly when I don't have cash and vice versa.  Its also pretty good for purchasing recreational substances (or many legal goods and services too of course). I've also used it to donate to non-profits.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:30:28
You'll probably be in luck
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:54:24
Coinbase is really easy once you get setup.  Too easy almost, I've made spontaneous buys and keep losing money.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:51:52
Yeah snow until April probably.  Its been dropping down to -5F the last week or so ... probably not surviving that haha.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:42:18
They list known patches of shrooms?  Too bad its winter here.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:47:29
How much time commuting was that each day?  I guess it covers your workout time as well.
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:01:37
Or an extremely vocal minority.

My guess is that he does not have a credit card on file as a backup to his checking account.  With that I can buy way more than I could afford instantly.
@_date: 2016-06-25 02:08:40
I think you're pretty safe with Coinbase.

Smart move by Coinstar.

Saturns are nice little cars, getting that gas mileage.
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:27:49
You say it like its a certainty that it hits $1000 again.  I hope it does, but there does not seem to be any indication of that any year soon.
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:28:35
Wouldn't the price be rising if there was that much demand?
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:40:44
Please tell me you are contributing at least that or more in your 401k each paycheck. Especially if your employer is matching.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket, especially something as volatile as btc.  I continue to buy btc but spend it almost as quickly ... it just has not been a good place to build wealth (yet).
