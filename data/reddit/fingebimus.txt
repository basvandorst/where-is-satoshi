I really don't understand this thread, why would you be so negative about tips. Tips are the reason I got into dogecoin, and if I would get some other tips I would seriously consider whatever that is as well.

And how does the reviewer get his 1 BTC back?

Here's an idea: buy what you fucking want and stop bitching about it.

In Belgium all unions have their own bar, some on or very near to the campus.

But in a way I understand them. I know people that would've never find a dealer, but could get whatever they wanted on darknets. It's a complicated situation.

Doesn't count, it isn't under the belt!

Where's the plot? I don't see it.

There are lots of reasons. Bitcoin as a whole is just inherently very susceptible to small changes in the ecosystem;

It's in fact weird to think about how many alternatives popped up the moment SR went down. I really think a new way of thinking about drugs should be put in consideration.

That's not really a good way to look at it...

It really isn't spam. It's just people sharing their love and Dogecoins.

You're welcome! Giving is what Dogecoin is about!
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:40:58
Even if Dogecoin eventually settles at 0$/DOGE, will people really care? Dogecoin is for now used as an alternative to karma or gold. You can tip people in very tiny increments, and you'll still feel like you've done something more significant than just upvoting. Doge is about sharing, not about greed and money, just for money.
