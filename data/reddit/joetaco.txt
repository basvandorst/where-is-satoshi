Gotcha, thanks for your help. I think I have a basic understanding now: 
Because the reference client relied on malleable transaction ids to confirm transactions, two issues pop up. First, mutated ids could confuse the client into showing the wrong balance. However, this is only a display problem - all the bitcoins are still going to the right wallets, so to speak. 
Second, if you go and spend some change from a mutated transaction before the tx is confirmed, there's a chance the new tx will never confirm. But again, the user can still access all his btc, and the attacker doesn't gain anything. Solving this issue while still allowing users to spend change immediately may require a change to the protocol. These things take time, and no one really thought tx malleability was a huge issue until shit started to hit the fan at mt.gox. (Though it seems this second problem could lead unsuspecting users to send a tx twice, having the impression that the first one didn't go through, as it was inexplicably unconfirmed.)
Mtgox was uniquely vulnerable because:
1. Something about mtgox using "noncanonical signatures" for transactions made it far more probable for the above attacks to work, because the mutated transactions are more likely to "beat" the nonmutated ones - that is, to be accepted first by a majority of clients. So the next blockchain cycle will contain the mutated id and not the legit one.
2. When users complained that a tx didn't go through, demanding a refund, mt.gox would simply check for the tx id, like the reference client would, rather than using other widespread, up to date methods of confirmation. So there's the attack that actually pays btc: Ask mt.gox for btc withdrawal » mutate the txid » tell them it didn't go thorough » mt.gox can't find the non mutated id because it's gone » here's some more btc for you then.
Does that sound accurate? I'm not a developer, this is just what I gleaned from your post and the forums.

Rather than really addressing the positive aspects of regulation, the author handwaves them away by saying "the free market will do that". Like many libertarians, he appears to live in a fantasyland where information asymmetry is not a common feature of markets.

Haha. Where does the capital come from? If we are to take this draft at face value, they need 200k btc to get back to life support. Here's their brilliant plan to get it:
1. Exploit btc arbitrage, even though apparently 99% of their btc is gone. I guess the consultants skipped the lecture on arbitrage during their mbas. I'm no business major, but I'm pretty sure that you need some fucking btc if you want to sell any to your idiot customers. Buying from other exchanges just to sell it back to them is not going to make you profitable again.
2. Sell equity for btc. Because who doesn't want a piece of gox? This business plan is so solid, the huge unfunded liabilities don't even matter, right? This is essentially the same as asking for straight up donations.
3. Asking for straight up donations. Hoping that wealthy investment types with the resources to start their own exchange will actually donate to these morons, just because they believe in btc, and they're magical men from Happyland, in a gumdrop house on lollipop lane.
4. Hoping that a half assed rebrand will make everyone forget the time every news outlet in the free world covered this story. My mom asked me about mt.gox for fucks sake. She did not know that word until learning that the vaults were emptied.
Sorry for the negativity, but I'm afraid they're delusional retards. Best case scenario: this draft is totally false, including the "make whole" plan.

If all the other major exchanges figured out this vulnerability already, why wasn't it reflected in the reference / known to gox?

Call me an optimist, but what I expect from a company with what... $0.5b in assets?... is responsible corporate governance. I get that they were hobbyists turned accidental millionaires. But look at all the other tech startups that turned into successful corporations that way. I get that they got there because they were first, not because they were best. But a business of that size has the money to insulate themselves from particular areas of management incompetence. They had a goddamn money printing tree, I don't understand why they didn't hire world renowned experts to prevent or reduce the many security and service issues.

Very good and rare explanation of these core concepts for newbs. I don't think it's right to paint this as 100% goxs fault though. If tx malleability is really the issue, then gox gets the vast majority of the blame, but bitcoin itself doesn't come out totally clean. The reference client used txids to confirm transactions as well. It was considered a low priority problem because it never caused widespread financial loss until mt.gox used the same method for refunds in their particular circumstances.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:44:52
IANAL but I believe for negligence to be *criminal*, it has to cause death or bodily harm. Or at least the possibility thereof. Nobody's going to jail unless this turns out to be fraud.
No idea what the Japanese law is, though.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:41:32
I agree. AFAIK the tx malleability attack just allows the attacker to hide a mt.gox tx from mt.gox, so they can request a second withdrawal after the first "didn't go through". Meaning that mt.gox voluntarily gave away 99% of its btc in refunds without batting an eye. Either there was another vulnerability, or there's something else going on.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:04:34
Bad for mt.gox, but arguably good for Bitcoin in tree long run.

If governments wanted to effectively put a stop to Bitcoin, they could.  Do you disagree?  I think everyone here is badly underestimating the power of the state.

IANAL but I am very skeptical of the first two. If you give a gun to a dude who tells you he wants to do a murder with it, you're aiding, whether he pays you or not. 
That being said I'd be surprised if anyone was actually prosecuted for this.

Yes.  And also shutting out another, much much larger crowd of payers.  Why not do both?

I dunno, there's pros and cons.  Yeah, less consolidation means less liquidity in each individual exchange.  But mtgox has shown us the downfalls of consolidation as well.  What happens if libertybit/virtex goes down?  Plus this way you have good ol competition to keep prices down.  Virtex's fees are ridiculous.

Good point: Davidson (who I love) missed a chance to talk about the best part of Bitcoin, IMO; how easily you can securely send it to anywhere.  Still, at least he made me laugh my ass off.

I'm no expert on accounting but I would assume that they already have many opportunities for embezzlement.  You'd have to have internal measures to protect yourself, true; just like with cash.  But maybe with bigger numbers involved.  I can't imagine any merchant keeping bitcoin "cash on hand" at this point in bitcoin's development, though.
But I'm definitely not recommending abandoning other payment methods in favour of bitcoin.  It would be insane, at this point, for an existing merchant to present bitcoin as anything other than an additional option.  I think to some businesses the savings in fees would be enticing enough; but for others, particularly smaller ones, the hassle of setting up a new system might not be worth it.

I fail to see how you can justify calling the option with more expensive transaction fees "cheaper for everything".  The advantages of something like Dwolla are ease of use and protection from volatility, not transaction fees.  It's not a question of whether businesses can afford it, lol - the only thing that's relevant is judging each service on its merits.  "Sure there's a cheaper and better source for this, but we can afford the more expensive service so let's go with that one!" - said no business owner ever.
tl;dr Bitcoin fees are cheaper, but Dwolla is still clearly the better option (for now)
Of course, if bitcoin shoots up in value again, transaction fees for Dwolla start to get more competitive.

Yeah.  Some of his claims don't make much sense or aren't argued well.  But one of his over-arching concerns is that bitcoin market has the characteristics of an asset, not a currency.  Here we are a year later.  Has anything changed in this respect?  I mean, what is OP referring to with "whoops", the fact that the value has shot up?  This only reinforces some of the criticisms.  Technically it's a currency, but it's not used as one.  It's held because everyone expects its value to increase.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:43:11
I agree with all this.  I just think that people are going to have to come to terms with the fact that, yes, your government does have the power to marginalize Bitcoin.  Not destroy it, of course, but they could scare people onto the deep web with the child porn if they really wanted.  It would continue to exist but would never see widespread adoption.

This is somewhat unrelated to the dumb RBC decision, but holy shit.  From cavirtex:


This just seems insane to me.  Why is virtex so much more popular than liberty bit?  At libertybit, EMTs cost $2 IIRC, and then fees are 0.5% instead of 3%.  From a bank, an EMT usually costs $1.  How can they possibly justify charging $20?  
Anyway, there is no way the extra liquidity makes up for the massive difference in fees.  I guess virtex's site looks more professional?  And it's bigger so people don't think they'll lose all their money.

Wow, if this catches on in the porn market that's the best case scenario for Bitcoin right now.  I can't imagine a better way to get people using Bitcoin (rather than holding it) en masse.  It would be huge.  Anonymous currency that doesn't leave you open to fraud?  It's perfect for porn.  The only problem is that it's not instant - people generally want their porn *right now* - by 6 confirmations, the show is generally over, no?  Still, this holds massive promise.
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:39:21
Yup. Just to spell it out for anyone that doesn't follow, zeus's implication is that there would be no such thing as barriers to entry if only it weren't for the damn state getting in the way. This is an argument that I have heard before, and it's ridiculous. 
If you don't believe me, just Google "barriers to entry".

If they wanted to - say, if they thought that BTC would grow to the point where monetary policy became useless - they could simply legislate against bitcoin.  No market-related scheming necessary.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:01:24
Vastly reduced transaction fees most definitely.  Maybe extra sales from people seeking out merchants that take bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:51:34
So it's only cheaper for microtransactions, then.
