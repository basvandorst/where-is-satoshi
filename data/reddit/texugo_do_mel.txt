"It is already 30%! You can't miss this opportunity!"
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:57:19
There is always that moment when you know that the price is way higher than a previous threshold. At this time, you can sell and wait for a good chance to buy again - maybe this opportunity will never happen because the price did not fall. However, there are some less obvious problems in this approach. Psychologial pression to sell, to use the money with other things - since this trading process can last for years. Problems with the own technology, Bitcoin is a great protocol, but everything related to software can have failures. I think that this kind of strategy is good, but you have to consider these factors too.

There are some DEXes that have on-chain order book and on-chain settlement, meaning that the exchange is autonomous and runs entirely on the blockchain as far as I know. I think that it is a pretty good level of descentralization and you don't have to give any information to the DEX. There is the risk of hack, since smart contracts can have bugs, but I think that it is a decent technology already.

As far as I know, even Monero has some issues concerning privacy - there is a statistical approach that you can use to "guess" who the participants are. I think that this kind of news are good to incentivise the development of biticoin's privacy and even the improvement of Monero and other privacy focused cryptocurrencies.

It depends on your portfolio. Since you didn't say "only Bitcoin", I would recommend you to try to use the best suitable wallet for your portfolio. If you have only Bitcoin, I would sugest you to read more about Electrum. I am not recommending it because I don't know the Android version very well.

This is something that people who are involved in this space usually don't give the proper attention - making non technical people aware of the technology. Good job, man!
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:06:43
I don't know so much about the current stats. If Bitcoin starts to be heavily used with everyday things, it will become a necessary mechanism.

There will be an integration with their card machines and it can be huge as they are one of the biggest payment processing providers in Brazil.
@_date: 2019-08-24 00:34:21
There are some great decentralized solutions available nowadays - with less liquidity, but still great. You could try to use one of these. You should not rely on exchanges that comply with esquizofrenic regulations.

There are some people who sold BTC at 100 USD or less. There is no way to know how the price is going to behave, but our expenses are always there. You are going to have other opportunities in the future.

Andreas is capable of explaining the relevance of Bitcoin and it's use cases in a very didatic way.
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:11:02
Price is important, but the health of the network is what makes BTC's real value. Good insight!
@_date: 2019-08-18 04:19:28
I saw that he used some left-wing terms often, but i think that it was the first time that i see him doing this. Nonetheless, he pointed out some really relevant problems. For example, the hability of the government to exclude people from the finantial system. It was not so bad.
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:10:55
I think that it is because his main concern is the education of people. People who are mostly concerned with the true fundamentals of this technology, like him, are prone to not try to centralize power.
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:18:11
I want to contribute in a more relevant way to the ecosystem and one of the contributions in the near future is to run a full node. You are absolutelly right, people should try to participate more actively on this space.

I saw this debate before. I liked the answer of the guy who was lecturing. He said that, as smartphones did with tech adoption, the same can happen with criptocurrencies. It is difficult to know if it is going to be Bitcoin, an altcoin or another technology.

I agree, at some extent, that there are some problems with censorship resistant platforms, like Steemit. However, censorship is never a good idea. Imagine having a way to "censor" Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:25:48
Following your chain of thought, we should have ways to censor Bitcoin as it can be used with "illegal activities".

This argument of money backed by benevolent institutions is too fragile to me. Venezuela and Zimbabwe are extreme examples, nonetheless real, but the american dollar have been experiencing lost of vaule throughout the years too. For me, utopia is the purchase power of currencies being degraded through time. It is easy to minimize the inflation problem if you live in a developed country, but it is a serious matter in underdeveloped countries and they are no numerical minority.
