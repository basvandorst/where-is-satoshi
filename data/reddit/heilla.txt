Hello everyone
I don't want to oversell this, but i (for personal reasons) really love NA(Narcotics anonymous). They saved my life, i had huge coke addict and was on the verge of losing everything. I was having pounding headaches when i sat down, so i had to sleep standing up.
I know it has a religious undertone but i'm as atheist as can be and it helped me. I no longer had to suffer through this thing alone.
Edit: added the suffering alone part

Never,ever,ever,ever again! I hate exchanges, they take soooooo much money as a "transaction fee"

Yea, we want to leave the profit in there as well. the more you have on there, the more you make.
