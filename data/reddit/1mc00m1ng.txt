Why not site your source's? [Everyone knows]( that or maybe you're just programmed to think so? [Nazi's]( were socialist, just like a growing number of the left today.

I already do, when are you going to realize that all major news networks are guilty of just that? Think for yourself buddy. Fox news didn't come up with Uranium one. Why did donations to the Clinton foundation fall off a cliff after she lost? They were pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars a year while she was in government and while running, now, peanuts.

Jesus man, don't you see how racist that is? I never said anything of the sort, you did, however. You don't know my race, creed, or sexuality. None of that matters to conservatives. What about Blacks for Trump? (The movement) What about the walkaway movement? Have you not heard of the love for Trump from Jewish communities across the globe? 
Wikipedia? "Lol it must be a simple world you live in." Why think for myself when I can just press buttons and have my opinions formulated for me? 
Maybe I'm reaching, but typically if someone is accusing someone of being racist, without cause, they're projecting. After all, you did ignore all my credible sources "with silly old facts."

Well, for one, I'm not the one responding like a child. In 2016 Trump won the election without the popular vote just like Trudeau did the other night. Since day one, the left has devolved into insanity and manipulation. 
Secondly, no he isn't. That was Biden. Here's the video: 
Why can't the President investigate corruption? 
Third, is it okay when Hillary does it? 
Fourth, why don't you mind when Obama wants to help Russians? 
Or Hillary's Uranium one deal with Russia?

I do have reservations and am not going to risk getting scammed but maybe we can do it in small batches or something. Also I think Coinbase has sped up their withdrawal times from over a week to one or two days and that might be safest.

I'm not good at TA but I really enjoyed being able to call this move up today. Just wish I had a leverage account to take advantage. I suspect a similar move and break out will happen around 8300.
