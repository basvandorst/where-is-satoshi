Did I suggest something without noticing?   
I mentioned the word "random" 3 times in my post, you assumed it was a suggestion, nice.

I am sure that everything can be  " constitutional " if govt's want too.  
Ok , enough with the  Conspiracy Theories.  


You 're right!  "Math side" of my brain was dead for a while.  Thanks

I am in bitcoin since 2012 sold so many times at panic situations, lesson learnt.  Not repeating the same mistakes again. Let it drop ... It will rise .. As far as block chain tech is doing so good no reason to panic. Best Regards
