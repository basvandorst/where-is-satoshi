Dont panic, I remember reading a very similar comment a month or so ago in the BCash attack from a guy saying he bought in at $7k.
Where do you think that guy is now? If he puckered up and held tight he's absolutely laughing. Play the long game my friend

Essentially yes - It is pretty relative to the number of unconfirmed transactions which are in front of you in the queue, that would currently be 170,000 (
The benefits of having your BTC in YOUR OWN wallet is exactly what it says on the tin. You hold your private keys; completely mitigating the possibility of losing them to something that is out of your control.
If you are planning on trading with your small amount of BTC I would recommend keeping it on the market. If you are planning on hodling it and letting it mature and grow I would recommend your own wallet.

Any estimations for the floor of this correction?

The difficulty for mining BCH just increased so fewer blocks are being released.
This means with a smaller 'reward' for confirming a new block, it has become less profitable to mine BCH. Meaning hashing power returning to bitcoin.
Also this means the backlog of unconfirmed BTC transactions  will now hopefully clear as people return to mining Bitcoin.

Glad to hear your perspective of it. I've calmed down and just accepted that my best option is just hodling onto what I have and riding this wave out.

Key example over here, bought in yesterday and currently freaking out
