So what is your fee structure solution that magically solves the block fill while keeping send costs reasonable? Seems 90% of the community is in agreement that block size needs to be raised and its not really a problem, so I guess you have no personal motivation for (monetary) to argue for raised fees right? 
@_date: 2015-06-17 00:54:17
True-ish I agree. I would still argue that its one thing to rattle your swords and say you are going to be destructive and another thing all together to sabotage your own investment.

@_date: 2015-06-02 12:21:31
Its not an OR situation ffs. We already have plenty of off blockchain transactions (Bitpay, coinbase etc.) But we also (obviously) need larger blocks. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:45:15
No, because that isn't what inflationary block rewards means. The block rewards are per definition deflationary since they decrease over time.

No it doesn't. If 50% of the network is a few individuals that would skew "voting" if we for some reason went by hashing power. Just let them drop out and network difficulty will adjust. The point is that decentralized hashing power votes, if a few major entities control the network its bad, let them bitch and whine and mine smaller blocks if they want to, more fees for everyone else.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:51:48
Again, what is up with your perception of time? Do you really think I am talking about monetary trends on a 3-5 year perspective in general? Look at 20+/50+ years for some perspective. Gold and silver has absolutely ruled fiat, showing quite clearly that paper money is a terrible concept.

@_date: 2015-06-05 14:54:07
Its also not true numbers. 0.07 w/GH is chip level under perfect (under clocked) conditions. There are 28nm chips that can run at 0.3 or lower on bench tests. Add board and PSU leakage and you cross 0.1 with margin. I expect 16 nm miners to run around 0.25 w/GH in real life scenarios.

Why? You are obviously free to work on and accept payment from anyone you want. It just seems fairly obvious that there is a massive conflict of interest between Viacoin and Bitcoin and having ties to Viacoin actually does matter when you are a highly opinionated developer.

@_date: 2015-06-19 18:56:50
Of course that can be debated, however I think that if you support the initial vision of Bitcoin you have to at least consider that many people 'joined' Bitcoin based on the Satoshi white paper and it and early forum posts clearly outlines the block size vision etc.

Hashing power does not equal "voting" power. Core developers should take responsibility for the health and survival of the viability of the network, and not bow to a few mining entities with deep pockets. If they don't want to continue mining, fuck em! Only takes a few weeks for the diff algo to adjust network diff.
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:10:17
I don't get the debate. Satoshi's vision was ALWAYS to raise the block size cap to accommodate transaction. Doing anything else is just shitting on the creators vision for the sake of your own damn 'invention' (get rich quick scheme).

@_date: 2015-06-05 14:48:56
Looking at the value of an actual dollar over some actual time (FYI, if you put $1000 in bitcoin in 2011 you could buy a house now) the value of Fiat has plummeted like a rock for every time period measurable while almost every metal and gemstone has skyrocketed in value.

@_date: 2015-06-19 23:31:55
I am not at all arguing this. All I am saying is that at least core developers and high profile opinion makers should be open with their involvement with "competing" projects. I don't think anyone would have much of a problem with this, versus if they try to hide or downplay their possible bias, that's where the issues start. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:54:56
True, yield for most foundries is 100% working chips (all cores functional etc.) So in reality you can use quite a bit more than the yield numbers. Our calculations was that at 25% yield guarantee we could still easily use 50% of the wafers (prob more like 75% if you do in house mining and is ok with fluctuations across miners). That said, with NRE of $10 million for first batch (not including design, but only mock, tape out and first wafer orders) it will still be one damn expensive chip out the door before they can really capitalize on the effects of scale (unless they placed prob $20 million+ at the gate, which is super unlikely considering you can't really take a shot in the dark for $10 million on a possibly flawed design). It will also be really interesting to see how they take it from chip to miner. Really hope they didn't skimp on the package and have a solid design for heat dissipation. I would also guess that the numbers so far are at chip level for lowest possible voltage, so "real world" w/GH is probably 0.12-0.15 at chip level and 0.20-0.25 after board and PSU leakage. Still impressive though.
Tldr: its a great leap but expensive. Also w/GH at chip on bench test and real world scenario is vastly different.

If you get lifetime referrals to Coinbase, circle, bitfinex etc. You have a income stream that will grow fast and for a very long time. I know Bitcoin companies that pay upwards of $5 PER CLICK for qualified traffic as well.

Which would translate to 20mb blocks not being prohibitive either, so that's good. (Since if 1mb blocks work on 56k, only 1.2 Mbit is needed for 20 mb blocks)

There is no such thing as 'will return a profit'. S7 is the first production miner to reach 0.2x w/gh but Bitfury, KNC and several others have not gone public yet. 0.1 w/gh is not unlikely before year end, and 2-500% hash rate increase isn't impossible at all.

Unless you have free power, you are no longer in the game (unless you purchase hardware and mine 'for fun'), and even with 100% free power there is NO guarantee you will ROI. I am expecting at least 100% diff increase over 6 months as 21, Bitfury, KNC and now Bitmain all come out with their next-gen miners. Could very well be a 5 or 10x increase as well (see. winter 2013/spring 2014).

And that is if not a great plan at least a step in the right direction. But without real traction with any other developer, even that won't happen so. . .  my point is that what is so damn attractive about Bitcoin to most people is the rebellious community consensus that can drive development, and yet somehow we are now at a point where nothing is allowed to happen because a bunch of people with huge wallets are too scared to be the rebels they once was. Ironically not realizing they are choosing a slow demise of Bitcoin over the risky and adventurous road that made them rich in the first place.

Of course its expensive. But even at very high estimates of say $3-5 million NRE (very high for custom rolled 28nm) they will recoup full cost on less than 3k units. And that's less than what they sell to 2-3 medium sized cloud customers. Their S5 sold easy over 100k units. Bitmain is in a unique position of being well funded, in a low cost and high competency region with huge regional sales. That said, time will tell. Hopefully we will see a spike in BTC price before diff catches up and we can once again study their pricing model. If price is flat, and difficulty takes off we should see price drop independently of Bitcoin price as ROI drops.

The point is that all manufacturers have extremely low hardware and power costs. It's clear from Bitmains pricing that they really aren't too worried about selling units since they clearly are selling them far above hardware cost. This means the current price is very close to what they value the earning rate at. And since the earning rate moves almost 100% with bitcoin price, so does their sale price.

Yeah I do. Look at the price of for example a Hashfast or Cointerra miner in 2013/2014 ($10-$12,000) and previous prices for Bitmain. They price their miners in Bitcoin, based on a formula of around 10 months ROI so price moves almost 100% with Bitcoin. Also, what are these competitors you speak of? Ever single ASIC manufacturer now mines for themselves and Cloud services, no reason for them to price anything in USD anymore since if they ROI on their miners it doesn't matter at all what the USD price is.

Of course I'm not arguing scaling immediately for billions of transactions a day. My point is simply that saying 'were fine' at 40% of Max block size is a TERRIBLE argument if bitcoin is going to be even a viable monetary clearing house, and not an everyday currency.

Doesn't matter though if you reap exponentially higher fees on mined blocks and control a large portion of the hashrate as not only do you get paid more to mine, but almost ironically you also get your spam cost back.

As someone with a fair share of insight into the gaming industry I can tell you that starting a sports betting service is FAR more capital consuming than any other venture. Not only does the anonymity (quasi) of bitcoin allow for more advanced cheating (negative long run EV money laundering etc ) but it is simply a really tough genres to break into. I don't think the general gambler understand the insane amount of capital that sports betting process. A single medium size sports betting operation can process many millions in bets on a single fight/game and it only takes a few lucky runs to go deeply into the red. I think there would be room for several Bitcoin sports books but so far, no one has stepped up with enough capital to consistently beat the odds.

Just ballparking it. Have worked at enough high profile start-ups to know they have at least $250k (40 people) in salary costs, prob another $100k in rent, $100k in airfare/hotel for just conferences and appearances, average $50k in conference attendance and sponsorship and $50-100k in different promotions. That's $500k+ a month, so maybe not $1 million but I am also prob forgetting a lot of things. My point being, where do they get their money from if they don't have trading fees?

I don't disagree with this on a functionality level. 
However, I think that if the inclusion of a chip (lets be fair here,  watt, it's a damn litebulb. No one is going to go broke mining with it) adds a learning factor, and possibly helps decentralize the network. 
It also opens up some interesting possibilities that does not come with pre-loaded Bitcoin (based on a steady transaction stream) and motivates the owner to run a full node (possibly, depending on stack solution). 
What I don't get it people that say it's a 'bad idea' simply based on the fact that a single ASIC chip is included. Why? They aren't selling it as a Bitcoin miner, hence the 'Bitcoin computer' moniker and the fact that they completely glance over the mining performance in their product presentation.

There is no such thing as expected return per chip. The production cost per chip is irrelevant compared to the NRE for tape out. That's the reason they need massive quantities to ROI on the design and will raise diff a LOT over the next 6 months.

This device isn't meant to become 'insanely popular'. As they pointed out in the recent interview they are targeted towards developers wanting to build on their stack/ecosystem. At 125 GH/s each they could sell 1,000,000+ devices and still not reach 50% of the network even at current difficulty.

Well someone saved some crazy for the fall semester. 
Either way, my point isn't that sidechains are centralized, just that they are for profit projects that compete with Bitcoin. And if (like a lot of 'personalities' in the community) you are heavily invested in sidechains (blockstream for example) you may not see the best of bitcoin as priority. 
"BITCOIN IS NOT YOUR PROPERTY, IT IS AN EVOLVING EXPERIMENT.

Of course its hard. I never said it wasn't, what's your point?
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:35:52
It simply means that if you use the device for it's intended purpose: To build applications and services using Bitcoin as a micro transaction system. You will be able to do so and pay transaction fees and make micro payments without depositing bitcoin anywhere. The $0.25 or so that the device mines on a daily basis will be sufficient to cover these small expenses.

"If it took 9 months to get from drawing board to a miner" But it didn't. They have worked on their hand rolled 28nm for at least the last 2 years (still damn impressive for the stats they squeezed out of it). And 28 - 16nm is a full redesign for 3D finfet where you can't reuse almost anything but some logic from 28nm. I don't expect Bitmain to go to tape-out before late spring 2016.
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:50:02
No idea, but I can almost guarantee it does not rely on selling $400 125 GH/s miners. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:49:20
Actually they don't. It all depends on the miner that mines a block. If 21inc let's all their asic mine towards a central pool and pays out only when their own network mines a block they can pay out very small transactions without virtually any fee. Or for that matter, just send them with dust-fee and let the miners wait for 100 blocks or so to receive the bits. Fees ensures that transactions get included in a TIMELY manner, they aren't necessary for a transaction to propagate at 'some point'. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:27:28
Like most 13 year olds here you are missing the point by a mile. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 11:56:31
Probably because it's a small batch prototype and $400 is roundabout what it costs them to product it in small series for development purposes. With development and small scale production I doubt they make any money off of it. People keep staring themselves blind on the hardware 'shelf price' and forgetting R&amp;D and NRE costs. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:37:09

Of course this may be true or not, but to judge it as a failure based on the hardware means that you have misunderstood the purpose of the product.

As a mining revenue device anyone with an IQ over 90 can figure out it's a bad proposition. This is also why 21e doesn't describe it or sell it as a bitcoin miner but a Bitcoin computer. The miner is just meant to create a micro stream of bits that facilitates development using the framework. The software stack is the real value proposition, not the ASIC. People shouldn't think of it as a miner, but rather as a development prototype. Think Development model of a cellphone used to learn and develop android applications, not 'the worlds best phone'.

What a 'surprise'. . .
@_date: 2015-09-22 14:09:33
I am making a ton of assumptions but yes, I assume that the 21inc pool will supply a steady stream of micro payments to all connected devices. Most likely with zero (or close to) transaction fee which they can provide by relaying the payments only in blocks mined by their own hardware. Or/and a future sidechain/transaction layer.
My point is mostly that people are misunderstanding their entire business, and somehow assuming they are trying to sell a 125 GH/s ASIC for $400, when that is very far from the reality of their plan.
@_date: 2015-09-05 04:25:23
Clearly not a 100% paid for fluffpiece at all :)
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:24:56
90% of people in this forum are 100% too stupid to understand the product. The amount of "It's an expensive ASIC" comments shows a vast lack of understanding or even ability to read.
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:22:12
The Bitfinex margin sell debacle was a reaction, not a cause. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:39:54
OR maybe 90% of this forum have no idea what 21inc is actually doing and think that their bitcoinc computer is 'an expensive ASIC". 
@_date: 2015-04-28 11:20:37
No one is "forced" to buy 15% over market on an exchange that doesn't support leverage. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 03:57:31
Why? They have over a year leap on Lightning if it even reaches completion. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:46:40
Absolutely, but 'how such a system might work' and a working system is pretty damn far apart. And considering how much time psztorch is spending whining about his competition on social media I would ballpark launch of Truthaltcoin2.0 to sometime after 2020.
@_date: 2015-09-03 17:05:11
Yeah, Bitfury only has like 10 months advantage over Bitmain. I bet they are just terrified.. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 11:53:01
If Trump can, then why not John :) I mean he's batshit insane, but at least he's entertaining and we could look forward to some really solid parties in the white house. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:12:24
How is it apples and oranges? There are 100s if not 1000s of companies that sell open source software solutions as SAAS for the very reason that people don't want to do it themselves. This is exactly what Factom is doing. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:54:08
Yes, and having biased core devs working for a private for profit company is awesome for the community.
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:21:34
Yeah of course not. Everyone wants to invest heavily in a technology where the main development team can't decide on a fairly trivial technical issue critical for the entire ecosystem in less than 12 months. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 00:27:59
500% increase at consumer prices with available technology requires around $1 billion. At Bitfury, KNC, Bitmain prices for server farms you can probably cut that by 70-80%, and the companies invoved have $100+ million in liquid capital already.
Not saying it will go up 500% but less than 100% by new years is a pipe dream. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:20:05
Absolutely, and what the value is only time can tell. I would however argue that IF the device provides a development environment that allows for the building of an actual smart bitcoin payment ecosystem supporting decentralized markets etc. $400 is an absolute steal.
@_date: 2015-09-23 11:39:47
Yeah, I bet your device is WAY smarter. When is it coming out again?
@_date: 2015-09-22 14:08:10
Are Apples the new Oranges? Report at 9!
@_date: 2015-04-17 21:08:12
Not even slightly correct. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:24:10
Because its 90% fake volume and the other 10% fractional BTC being traded back and forth without fees. Tldr: just another day in China. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 03:56:56
Obviously not, that would break the entire point of the device. It's not a bitcoin miner, it's a software stack and hardware combo that uses an ASIC to enable the environment. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:13:46
100 billion devices mining bitcoin.. Yeah, that's economically viable :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:11:32
Depends, he can have the best of both worlds if he thinks price is on the move up. Just decide exactly how much of the money he needs, and sell if it drops to that level, if not hold on and see where it goes. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:49:30
That AND he worked closely with carders and drug dealers that sold off bulk amounts of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-27 11:51:14
Open source systems can be used before released in many cases, just depends on core functionality and what parts you need to use.
@_date: 2015-03-26 12:18:28
Oh Neteller, I still have fond memories of the $8900 the US government stole from me when they raided them back in 2002 (or when it was) due to their relation to online poker.

His comment brings nothing to the table and isn't even on topic. All OP stated was that he was willing to lose the money. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:27:13
Pretty sure Erik just tweeted an already edited image in good faith. You seem like kind of a dickbag with that title as well. Have fun with that.
@_date: 2015-03-23 23:24:37
No it wasn't. Its perfectly possible to make money mining with a single asic at home.

You can reverse payments for 90 days and if he does PP will take the money whether you have them or not. Aka. Minus in your bank account! 
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:09:42
Not what's happening here. This is just the game as its played when "big money" enters. Look at shorts and longs and you can see that it's just a game played by people with deep pockets and has nothing to do with Bitcoin sentiment. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:45:53
Not biggest scammer just biggest altcoin scammer. He backed Maxcoin with both his own name and tweets. The coin was pre-mined to approx 95% and he dumped $100,000s of the coin and never looked back. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:20:03
The point isnt your wildly conspiratorial rants but rather that it has nothing to do with the post in question. He simply stated that has willing to lose the money and you go 100% Alex jones. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 12:05:18
What is this based on?
@_date: 2015-03-30 11:09:01
Well he DID in fact launder money, but he wasn't directly involved in anything really shady.

Hook up with mining entities such as Bitfury.

Bashing Havelock while promoting a product supported by Max Keiser, the biggest scammer in altcoin history (Maxcoin anyone?) Hah, good luck.

I bought a T-shirt for 230 BTC back in 2011 and that's part of the reason I'm not rich as fuck. It was just an experiment, and still is though the denominations have changed.

Large amounts of virgin coin (mined coins) usually garner quite a premium. 5-15%.

That's why you pool mine. For fucks sake, if you don't know how Bitcoin or mining works stop answering threads about it.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:10:42
And that mean you are correct in your nonsensical comment? 
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:51:27
Sounds about right. I just know I lost a chunk of change as a US customer when they locked the US accounts.

Or they run a company and does not want to come off as 12 year olds .
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:00:10
Still beside the point. You were answering a comment where op said he WAS WILLING TO LOSE IT. As for your theories that swat are going to start breaking down doors of random people that happen to own bitcoin... Yeah I'll just leave now.

If you can invest pre-tax through IRA/Roth its still worth it.

There is almost no correlation between the size of the farm and raw profitability. Of course you make "more money" if you have 1000 miners making $5 a week after cost, but with the same cost per miner the earning is the same with one. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 23:20:38
Obviously not, And from someone that used to play poker professionally: there is a massive amount of cheating on SWC! Never play high stakes games vs more than 1 played! You will get colluded by cheaters.

I received information from Neteller that i could apply for withdrawal but at the time i was earning a lot of 'not exactly IRS friendly' money online so I opted to just take the loss and move on.
