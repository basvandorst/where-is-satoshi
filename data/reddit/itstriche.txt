Idk man, the forks have been pretty profitable for me so far. BCH itself was a huge windfall.

Your losses may not go down, but the whole point of investing in whatever commodity/stock you have was because you had faith in it. Obviously if the stock is dropping bc of something very real like bankruptcy or other irreparable news, buying more of a dying stock doesn't seem like a great idea. 
However, one of the first rules of finance is "Buy Low - Sell High". 
Seems obvious right? 
Then why the **hell** would you be selling now if you bought in at $800? The whole point of doubling down when the price drops is because you realize that this is a **buyers market** and there is very real evidence to suggest it will recover *and then some*. (to the moon!)
It shocks me that anyone in this community is even sad to see the price dip this low. After reading the countless articles posted here in this sub, i am extremely optimistic about the future promise this amazing technology holds. This is such a great opportunity to get in at lower prices while the speculators play with themselves wondering whether or not it will go anywhere. If you are in, you are already taking the risk. Use price drops as an opportunity to strengthen your holdings!
However, be smart and only invest with what you are willing to lose (as is the case with any risk related investment)

In light of all the security breaches lately, this point is particularly salient. Thanks for typing this all up. I've added it to my FAQ repertoire.

Citi-bank had direct ties to the passing of The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, better known as the piece of legislature that ["repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, removing barriers in the market among banking companies, securities companies and insurance companies that prohibited any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank, a commercial bank, and an insurance company." -- Wikipedia]( This piece of legislature is most likely the most instrumental factor in the collapse of the housing market and the American economy as a whole in 2008. And surprise, surprise -- banks like JP Morgan actually MADE money off of the collapse, and ended up consolidating their power even more. It almost seems *calculated*... because it was. They either were incredibly reckless with the fire they were playing with or deliberately intending to damage the structure of our economy for quick gains, regardless of the cost. Either way, it is exactly what some of our founding fathers warned against, a powerful central bank, and they are so unscrupulous, i would put NOTHING past them. 
This is only one of several examples i can think of where lobbyists for banks or the financial industry have either directly or indirectly contributed to the wording of legislature that was passed on levels ranging from municipal to federal government. There is another one they snaked into the most recent funding bill that removes part of the Dodd Frank Act and allows for [taxpayers to bail out banks, even foreign ones]( We live in terrifying times.

Coinbase is also FDIC insured, so that is an option for you if you don't want to hold coins in your own offline wallet. 
And when was Bitcoin "hacked"?
