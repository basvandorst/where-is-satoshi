Haha, even if it goes down to 7k, I’d still be up from when I bought in xD 
Honestly I think it might go lower, though that’s just me being very very fearful. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:51:10
I am not reducing it yet, this is only the first and early sign if anything. If Michael Bloomberg, or Lloyd Blankfein also reverse their position on Bitcoin, then I’d begin by taking out my initial investments, so no matter what I’d break even already, and then set a threshold price/marketcap value, to pull out at. 
But once the bubble pops, will I get back in- cause Cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

Prior the the official announcement that it shutdown? You know, the shutdown that was expected to happen for the past week?

What’s fake? The pineapple fund or MAPS? Or MDMA?

Dude said he’s going to hold till he dies, so I don’t think he’s exchanging it for any other currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:19:38
Any exchange allows you to buy like 0.000001th of a bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:19:23
This is why I don't believe the crypto bubble is going to pop soon. Once the general perception of Bitcoin and the likes shift from "it's a bubble" to " it's not a bubble", I'll probably sell and buy in again at the big crash.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:53:41
NEM, COSS, ETN, XMR, uh... LTC... yeah that's all I got xD

Because there’s never been a case of someone hoarding up cash, right?

What is Delta called and what is it for? I can’t find it in the store.

I meant to say invested*
I never said it'd guarantee returns.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:35:51
My point wasn’t any of that. It’s that and Roger keeps on talking about how Lightning is controlled by banks, centralized, blockstream, blah blah, but Roger says that Lightning would be better for BCH in CNBC... so is he saying centralization is better for BCH? Or is all the FUD about Lightning bullshit?
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:40:45
If you invest $500, you'd make 100% profit in less than a month. That's very good for that amount of time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:16:15
Roger has also said on CNBC that lightning, the evil-controlled by banks offchain solution to BTC’s scaling problems, would be better for BCH- which kinda contradicts the FUD they’re spreading about it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:55:48
Is this quote even attributed to someone?

REQ is pretty promising. But this is a Bitcoin sub not cryptocurrencies sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:35
Probably not too much- I'm a student so the amount I spent into Crypto is &lt;1,000
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:52
If I'm an international student in the US, and I'm withdrawing &lt;1year old bitcoin, do I have to pay tax? Sorry am dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:09
This is generally what people say about coins they don't like. Be it ETH to NEO, BTC to BCH, XRB to IOTA, and all vice versa. Ignore it, now's the time to buy BTC and BCH. BCH is in a bull run and BTC is down so buy.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:33:43
When everyone stops calling it a bubble is when I'll sell, because it'll be a bubble then.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:38:24
Ethereum, IOTA, Waltonchain, NEO?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:59:46
Probably penny stocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:08:39
Ah yes, look through my post history. I’ve only talked about Mr. Ver &lt;10 times.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:04:04
But, there comes to a point where when a stock reaches too high of a price to even buy a single one. It's at that point nobody wants to buy it anymore- whereas with crypto, that point doesn't exist, right?
I'm not trying to argue fyi, I'm trying to learn
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:00:19
Judging by your profile, you're pro-BCH. I'm not really anti-BCH, I don't think it's a scam, in fact I don't get why people are very much against it, but it's very much inaccesible to a layman like me which is why I never touched it in the end. However, if you really think BTC is going to dip and never rebound, you're fucking delusional.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:19:32
Yes, but doesn't that support my assertion? That the fact you can buy $100 worth of Bitcoin regardless of the price factor in to its price- and impede it from crashing as quickly and badly as the stock market crash of 2008? Because it opens up the market even more to the middle class without requiring them to put all their savings into it to own a share? Or am I misconstruing things?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:47:59
This is the type of person you'd be in 2005 and 1920:


You sound like a douche wanting people to fail, and celebrating if it does. But guess what? Less than 10 years after the 2008 market crash, stocks is at an all time high, so fuck you.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:38:07
It might drop a bit more, just be a bit more patient. It's not going to rebound as quickly as it did last time... last time it went up by $1000 in a day because it was only devalued by JP Morgan's comments. This time it will probably be a bit more gradual, I give it about a week, maybe even more.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:32:00
Ahh abit sad though. Didnt think it'd go below 6000 so I bought some at 6100, now it's at 5800. I really thought I could buy it at the bottom of the dip this time... oh well, can't wait for 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:55:06
I don't understand why this guy debates with everyone on twitter. He's incredibly intelligent, but he should know you can't put forth an eloquent argument in 240 characters or less.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:46:04
There are some shops that have a physical machine that accepts bitcoin payments, but mostly it's online transactions e.g steam, Microsoft, quite a bit of travel booking sites, etc. It's a digital currency, so yeah.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:36:07
What exchanges do you recommend I use?
Is cryptopia good?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:51:21
You don't have to mine Bitcoin to get it- in fact you don't even mine bitcoin, you're rewarded bitcoin for verifying transactions.


A 10 second google search is not research
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:08
I think if this keeps up and my prediction of


is incorrect and there continues to be very little vendors accepting it, it can go one of two ways-
It becomes a bubble, pops and becomes worthless. Another less volatile cryptocurrency takes its place and is used as an online currency with a less fluctuating price.
Or it becomes like Gold. Initially used as a currency, it gains value and instead becomes an asset that changes in value depending on the market's demand for it. Because of the cost of mining it and the decreasing supply, it is seen to have intrinsic value.
However, if my prediction is right, I believe there'll still be a bubble bursting. However it'll be the crypto bubble bursting because of all the companies trying to come in and profit off of crypto- just like the .com bubble, and one of the bitcoins, along with a few other crypto, will survive, whilst still retaining high value; just less volatile now, and actually used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:39:20
Idk man, I'm buying it with the bank because I'm not very good with technical stuff. It'll probably be better if you buy it some other way, unless you can't be bothered to like me xD
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:54:27
3 hours after this post BTC went up to 6900... coincidence?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:09:30
Ah, I see. Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:06:39
The fuck you talking about bro?
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:48:54
Does the fact that you can buy 0.001 of a bitcoin whilst not a partial share when trading stocks factor into all this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:35:46
It'll rebound by the end of next week, unless China somehow bans bitcoin again lmao.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:04:05
That's not what crypto is intended for? You're supposed to spend it too.
Sure, keeping some of it as an asset to profit makes sense, people even do that with FIAT... but if you and everyone else only uses it to make money doesn't that make it a bubble? 
Seriously people, spend your bitcoins and crypto, don't just hoard it like it's stocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:49:25
Fuck, I didn't think about that hahaha. I'm dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:26:30
This isn't stocks, it's currency. Just like how you can have $0.10, you can have 0.10 bitcoin or even less. Why are you so spiteful that you'd hope people become homeless? You're the type of guy that was probably celebrating when the stock market crashed because you're a piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:49:06
Hi, could you please elaborate on that? I'm still very new to all this cryptocurrency stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:29:07
Other than the fact that you won't have the seed/private keys on Coinbase, what is the difference? Does it function similarly, what can I do on a exchange that I can't do on a wallet?
And what in Breadwallet stands out compared to other wallets? You guys recommended it but what makes it better? Is it user friendly, or simple, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:50:28
That’s because the people who say things like this are most likely going to have their comment removed.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:05:07
Alright, so that means I CANNOT buy and sell bitcoin with a wallet like Breadwallet? 
Then, how would I store my bitcoin from an exchange to a wallet? Let's say like Coinbade to Breadwallet.
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:56:26
So if I want to buy and sell bitcoins, and store them in a safer way (in a wallet), do I have to use both an exchange and a wallet? An exchange to buy and sell and a wallet to store it? Can a wallet like Breadwalley store bitcoin AND buy an sell bitcoin? Or can you only do that in a exchange like Coincase?
If so, which exchange would you guys recommend? I heard Coincase is pretty good.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:27:09
How do you know this? He made his comment 3 hours after the post was made, and 2 hours before mine— and I saw the post on the top of all when I made my comment. Unless for the first 3 hours, it didn’t even go to rising, and suddenly decided to jump to the top of all in 2 hours, I don’t believe you.
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:40:49
This sub was created with very vey very strict moderation.
Most likely anything slightly negative about BTC will get removed.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:32:04
What comment?
His post history doesn’t indicate that he browses this sub, the fact that he came in later than most other top comments and is not simply agreeing/overtly pro-Bitcoin indicates he wouldn’t be browsing this sub. Absolutely nothing points to support your claim- yet you vehemently stand by it with absolutely no evidence.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:25:20
Because it’s in and they decided that’s they want to have a discussion about the post. The post shows that financial institutions are scared of BTC, but the guy above disagrees, and myself and others agree with him. How is that trolling?
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:03:05
May I ask what's the difference between Breadwallet and say, Coinbase? I'd just like to know what makes it stand out more than the rest.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:21:24
Cool, I've downloaded Coincase, what's the difference between linking a debit card and a bank account to it? Is it true that you can only buy and not sell with a debit card? 
And if I do link a bank account, they say it'll take 4-5 days? If I sell at a specific value then would the value change when the money finally comes in? Because the bitcoin value would obviously change in 4-5 days. 
Thanks a lot btw, you're real helpful✌��
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:50:13
So that means I can store Bitcoin cash in my breadwallet?
