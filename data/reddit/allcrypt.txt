And whys that? HE posted it on the blog. Maybe I'll just allow the blog comment, and link to it, and you can see the email he posted there?
Hey, he gave me the address. I'm getting really tired of people fearing calling hackers and cheats out and posting their information. Criminals using the law to hide their identity has to stop.

Since we aim to support ALL cryptocurrencies that have community support, and we have personally traded some of those coins, we wanted to be able to accept donations, which were actually offered to us, in more than just BTC.
We're hardly AllCrypt if we are only open to one coin.
As for any derision over the validity/usefulness of other altcoins, that is immaterial. If people want to trade these coins, NOT offering them for trade because in your (your being whoever) opinion they are worthless is closed minded, and the EXACT reason we started this exchange. Too many altcoin exchanges cherrypick the coins they offer, leaving some which may be a viable choice, on a dead end road.
In reality, dogecoin has not much more going for it that LTC does. Its not revolutionary. Its only really different in it's payouts and confirmation times.
But it has a killer community, and is quickly becoming the altcoin of choice.
We will not stand in the way of any coin merely because it's "stupid" in someone's opinion. At user request, we added ShitCoin (SHT) to the voting. We let the community decide which coins get added to the exchange. I think ShitCoin does nothing for the cryptocurrency world and merely mocks it. I, personally, do not like the concept. But it's on the voting. If it's a popular enough coin with enough backing, it has just as much chance as any other to be listed.
While you see donation addresses in unpopular altcoins as unprofessional, we see it as actually standing behind the philosophy we profess.
We call that integrity.

Just wanted to say thanks to MintPal. While AllCrypt.com trades in all crypto, and not solely BTC, exchange operators should take note of the honesty and integrity MintPal showed in assisting us in returning stolen BTCS to our users.

This is EXACTLY what AllCrypt.com aims to do. Thank you for posting that story. We want to be the one that gets that free advertising space. 
Unfortunately due to US bury the individual laws we will NOT be dealing with fiat, only crypto to crypto, but we are an exchange nonetheless. We've avoided posting here because we are not purely bitcoin but upon seeing this article, we had to speak up. 
Thanks. And for anyone interested, check out our landing site:
We hope to launch this week.

Addendum: We also heartily welcome all (constructive) criticism.

So I just did a little looking, and I told it I wanted to buy an item for $75. It told me to send .167 BTC to cover it.
$75 on preev.com is .160
Trying to figure out where the savings are...?
Not seeing the 7% discount anywhere. In fact, it looks to be about 5% over.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:56:15
If a solution can be worked out, I'll have it on our exchange faster than you can blink. 
We are doing everything possible to ensure security, and provide transparency and verification   This is the logical next step. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:03:53
It's a optional feature we are launching with at AllCrypt.com - you can save your withdrawal addresses, then using the security panel, lock them.
They are unchangeable without a support ticket, manual administrative intervention, and a waiting period.
We are doing everything we can to make AllCrypt.com as hack proof as possible.
(For those of you not familiar with AllCrypt.com - which is probably everyone right now - we are a crypto exchange similar to Cryptsy - we do not deal in fiat)
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:56:54
Saw this post this morning in my ZeroBlock feed and wanted to respond.
While AllCrypt.com does not deal in fiat (yet? The laws are such a mess right now, and licensing is a nightmare) and we are crypto-to-crypto only, we're still an exchange. We still hold coins. And I wanted to respond to this letter, and Wit22's as well.
We agree wholeheartedly. We have no idea why security is so lax on some of these sites. I expect that many people are too lazy for security, and it's easier to use an exchange that doesn't hassle you. It stuns me that coinbase.com has an option to turn off your 2FA for 30 days for logins from your IP address. Sure, they'd need your IP to log in, but thats not out of the question.
AllCrypt.com employs a vast array of OPTIONAL security features. Yes, they are optional, because we believe in choice. If you want to leave 52 BTC on our exchange and have merely a username and password protecting them, that is your choice. We at allcrypt are all (mostly?) libertarians who believe in personal choice and freedom. If you want to be stupid and leave them on the proverbial sidewalk to be walked off with, we aren't here to diaper you and protect you from yourself.
That being said, the more security you have the more of a hassle it is to use your account. This is true anywhere. Its why we make our features optional. You can choose the right balance of annoyance for security vs ease of use that you like.
We employ 2FA, which if enabled is required to make a withdrawal.
We have optional email confirmation for withdrawals (which, admittedly, if they are in your account they likely have your email also).
You can save, and lock, withdrawal addresses. You enter your addresses, you lock them down, and they cannot be changed*. You also have the option to lock down any empty addresses as well. It's well and good to lock your BTC withdrawal addresses, but if they sell the BTC for DOGE then withdraw the DOGE, thats not much protection.
We have email notifications from everything from logins, to withdrawals, to updating security settings.
You can lock down your withdrawal addresses, your email addresses (You can add multiple, and can NOT remove them without administrative assistance, so if someone gets in your account, they cannot remove your email), lock down password changes, and removing your 2FA.
What protects those lockdowns and keeps a hacker from unlocking your withdrawal addresses?
Four options:
Email confirmation. As mentioned before, this is a minor annoyance. Likely not secure at all.
2FA code required. Pretty strong but if someone has your device, its not secure.
24 hour lockdown. You cannot disable your settings for 24 hours once you need to. During that 24 hours you are sent alert emails to all email addresses on your account. Oh - all emails are hidden. There is no way for a hacker to see your 'other' addresses to try to get into those also and delete the notifications.
And the most secure: Support Ticket. Your security is completely unable to be disabled except by an admin in our admin control panel. Which requires us to actually verify your identity, by email, 2FA, trade history questions, login questions, and phone calls if need be.
If you lock down your withdrawal addresses, and set your unlock security to be Support Ticket, the only way for your coins to be stolen is for them to convince a human being that they are you.
No computer system is 100% secure. There are always new hacks coming out. But we've done everything we can to ensure that we are as solid as possible.
In addition - we sign all our emails with our public BTC address. You can verify that emails we send you are legitimate by pasting the data into your bitcoin-qt client and verifying the signature. We are not aware of any other exchange that guarantees their emails as phish-proof (assuming you actually check).
You can read a rundown of all the security features here:
And the lockdown/unlock settings:
We are also actively investigating some of the many proposed systems for verifying the balances we hold in escrow for our users, to prove we are not insolvent. But user security and privacy is a supreme concern - we won't just publish addresses online without some form of security. Once something is developed and is made accessible, and is deemed safe and secure, we will be one of the first on board.
We just opened 6 days ago. We're still small. But we're focused on the big things, and we are ALWAYS open to suggestions, comments, and constructive criticism.

WHICH "one of the values" in info.plist?
@_date: 2014-06-15 00:45:29
Its in there like 4 times. Just change it all to 7.0? That seems a bit reckless.

As if I needed more reason to hate walmart.

All of them do. They have to. It's the bitcoin client/wallet. Even sites like blockchain.info have bitcoind underneath it all, somewhere. I guess they could take the original and rewrite it into something else, but at the core, it's in there.
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:03:22
Not sure I'd bother buying bitcoin for $488 when I can get it on coinbase right now at $458. I dont see the appeal for the BTC buyer. You're going to have tons of buys and no sells. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:54:59
How do you suggest a user does a withdrawal if the coins are not in a hot wallet?
And before making such a broad statement as "NO ONE" uses bitcoind - what are these exchanges using to interface with the blockchain? Since not a single one has published the internals of how they operate, thats a pretty big statement to make.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:44:03
Yeah as we're based in the US and don't want the feds crawling up our backsides, we're all crypto for now. As regulation and licensing settles down we hope to add fiat exchange, but we don't see that happening anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:22:14
We are running AllCrypt as open as humanly possible. All added coins are publicly voted on. We started AllCrypt because we hate the favoritism and closed doors of the other exchanges.
What can we do to convince you, or to at least alleviate your fears, that we have no intention of absconding with anyone's coins?
Nothing can STOP a site operator from doing that. But we are fully committed to doing everything we can to ensure that that is NOT a worry of our community.
We would absolutely LOVE to find a way to allow our members to validate that the coins they deposit are still there, while still keeping their account information secure. Posting all deposit addresses is hardly a good way to do it. If a trusted service we could subscribe to that would accomplish that were to come about, we would absolutely be first in line.
The issue is user security. One feature we offer is anonymous accounts. You give us a username, a password, and a 2FA authentication. Thats it. We dont want your email address. And we won't log your activity (obviously we need to log trades, deposits and withdrawals, but we do not log login activity, IP addresses, etc). We are big proponents of privacy, and want to offer as much privacy as is reasonably while still offering security.
I took my son to see the new RoboCop last night. At some point, the character played by Samuel L Jackson is talking to his TV audience and is spouting off his agenda, and says "What is the most important thing to the citizens of the US? Security."
I beg to differ. We believe that answer is freedom. Freedom to do what you like - as long as you don't hurt anyone else. You freedom to swing your fist ends at my face.
We want to offer freedom. Privacy. With as much security is reasonably possible. We are ALWAYS open to hearing suggestions on how to better achieve both.
I am stating right now that if a service becomes available that allows our users to verify their coins in our system, while still protecting their privacy, the privacy of our other members, and our privacy as well, we will be first in line.
We welcome ALL suggestions.

Don't use any exchange then. As far as I'm aware, every single one out there has had security issues ranging from loss of coins to user accounts being compromised.
Only use the perfect ones that have never had an issue.
Oh, wait...

Except they don't have walmart OR amazon anymore... back to Gyft it seems...
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:01:16
What that says however is to not rely on it. We don't rely on it. We were using it merely for accounting until we noticed it would keep coins from overspending in the event of an error or hack.
All accounting is stored in the database. The only other issue that we could run into is the performance issues when we hit thousands of accounts. If that performance issue occurs, we merely stop using any of the accounts related features. Because, like I said, it's not integral.
Yes, if we relied on it, thats an issue. We don't.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:30:04
All that had been taken care of and is detailed in other blog posts.
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:03:44
How do you handle sub-5400 satoshi trades? How do you pay the .0001 tx fee on a .000001 sale? How do you have speed with up to 10 minutes (or more if the tx is small) for a single confirmation?
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:44:50
Its nearly impossible to do that unless each user has their own wallet. Then you have the problem of what if I buy 3 doge at 180 satoshi each. You cannot even send a 540 satoshi transaction, it's below the minimum (5400). And if you could, who wants to pay a .001 fee on a .0000054 send? Exchanges like mine are possible because all deposits come into a central wallet, and are moved internally and tracked by accounting.
There is a link in the article that discusses possible ways, but it' a service that needs to be run by a trusted third party.
WE could implement it, but if WE are the ones validating our own coins - we could just lie. It needs to be an open source system we implement, or a service provided by someone you trust. Not something we can do in house.
We could publish every deposit address, and software could do the math, but that reveals too much - like our users sending addresses. The number of users. Etc.

If you actually HAVE something, post it. I reblogged your blog now I'm regretting it. Don't come in here and say you wont pre-announce things, then pre-announce that things will come to light soon.
No one here believes you. So you want "cred" back? Post it. You have dirt that could save some people some financial heartache? Post it. Now.
