My understanding is that if you have the legacy client you will see this block as a 1MB block since the witness info goes in a separate part of the transaction that the legacy client can't see. If you have the current client that sees segwit the full block size will be seen, including the witness size. Segwit is an actual block size increase  up to about 4MB (if the blocks were filled with all segwit transactions)

Especially considering the fact that they keep selling contracts well after the initial date. If a price cycle propagates it will only be because of investor mistrust and misunderstanding, my gut feeling is that this is likely to occur anyway so the prophecy is somewhat self fulfilling, regardless of the fundamentals driving it. Confidence is what drives bitcoin's price for the most part, not whales.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:24:19
I am aware that is the concept but there would have needed to be someone (or a group) on the other side of that short holding the long position in order for the contract to activate. The people holding the long position have just as much incentive to buy as the price decreases. The futures market is a balanced market. The only thing that actually makes the price drop is fear of conspiracies like this.

The entire futures expiration dip is more about FUD than fact. The reason the price dips before they expire is because people don't understand how futures work. everyone here associates futures with shorting when in fact there is just as much money in long positions. Every short position must be matched by a corresponding long position to make a contract. The money going long is just as motivated to buy Bitcoin and drive the price up as the short positions are to drive the price down. It's much easier to raise capital in USD to buy bitcoin than it is to find BTC to sell. Keep in mind that it is illegal to do this either way, especially if there is any conspiracy between whales. The reason the price swings so much is because people are afraid of manipulation, not because of actual manipulation. 
Edit: These are cash settled futures, not commodity settled futures. In cash settled futures you need matching short and long positions capitalized against the CME in USD. [Source]( (He is on the oversight board that determines CME's Bitcoin reference rate)

Core just merged their UI code yesterday. Up until that point segwit was only supported via command line interface in core. Developers were probably waiting for the core devs to do their homework for them. Now that the UI is merged expect other companies to cross check their code against the open source core code, implement any oversights, test and then deploy. Hopefully shouldn't be long.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:55:54
They're just the most familiar with it and therefore in the best position to implement it first. Those companies already have blockchain experts working for them. All it will take for Bitcoin's price to take off is proof of concept to get the ball rolling. You don't need a ton of companies using it immediately to cause a price surge. Look at Bcash, almost nobody uses that and it's price saw a nice bump from one major exchange implementation.

I would think that at this point most people who shorted have sold off the vast majority of coins when the price was much higher. I'd think it's much easier to buy a shitload of Bitcoin to cause a buying frenzy than sell a ton of bitcoin. Usd is much easier to source than BTC

There are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin waiting to be spent and they want a piece of it.

But the person who did not have bitcoins and bought them for a certain value benefits from a higher price (he can sell them back at a higher price). 
The only thing that allows what you said to happen instead of this is FUD and a fundamental misunderstanding of financial tools by the young investing community.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:58:33
The bitcoin is held on a multisignature wallet that is broadcast to the blockchain once the channel is closed. When the channel is closed the history of the multisignature wallet is broadcast and settled on the blockchain. If the other party tries to steal btc on this wallet by creating a transaction you don't approve of and broadcasting the wallet to the main chain you get all of the coin in the wallet when (or if) you catch them in time. This sequence will be automated by wallets and other apps so you shouldn't need to do anything to catch them, it's just the protocol to keep things safe.

@_date: 2018-01-25 20:48:34

How long have you had them? in the US you'll pay your full tax rate(depending on your bracket) on it for short term gains on assets held for less than a year. If you've held for more than a year it's only 15%  
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:17:25
No, every short position is matched by an equal long position in these futures. This means that there is equal money on the other side of the table. since the folks on the other side of the bet have just as much to loose they have just as much incentive to manipulate the market upward by buying, all they need is available fiat to buy with which is easier to come by than BTC to sell. The future sales have nothing to do with this price drop, it's just a rush for the doors by new investors.

No, it would make more sense for people with long positions to make massive purchases causing bull runs. They could then short later with their Bitcoin. It makes no sense to buy Bitcoin before futures open if you plan on manipulating the market because you could profit on the way up and on the way down if you opened a long position first. Not to mention the fact that this would be illegal anyway.

Because it's intentionally misleading in order to entice buying. I'm as excited about LN as the next guy but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

I think alts will see big gains in Q1 and the first half of Q2 and then it will be all BTC/ETH (maybe Monero). I'm hoping that by the end of Q1 most exchanges and wallets will have launched segwit (given news that core merged their UI code today). By the end of Q2 I expect lightning to have several decent sized retailers/firms running nodes. Schnorr signatures I would think will come by the end of the year, but that's a total guess and could take a long time to actually implement.

Ya, I said that. This obviously makes the potential value much higher than I calculated. It was easier for me to conceptualize supply when I compared it to a single currency rather than all currencies as I don't see BTC replacing all the world's currency and it's hard to put a number on exactly to what extent it could replace fiat globally.

I don't think OP realizes how limited 21million is in terms of supply. to put that into perspective, there are 323million Americans. The population of the world is 7.6 billion. That's .065 BTC per American or .003btc per person in the world. There is currently 1.2 Trillion USD currently available. $1579 per person in the world. if you divide 1579 by .003BTC you get that bitcoin would be worth 526,315 times as much as the dollar based on volume. That is to say, if bitcoin were to be held and used as widely as the US dollar it would be worth $526,315. This does not account for the fact that several million bitcoin are lost and that because bitcoin is a global currency, and deflationary, it could in fact be used and distributed more widely than the USD.

Traders that plan on paying taxes. The easiest way to figure out how much you owe is by cashing out and subtracting money in from money out. Otherwise you need to pay gains on every trade individually, even between currencies. I know a few people who are afraid the government is going to come after them some day since there is no statue of limitations on tax evasion. It would cost a lot to hire someone to go through their trade history and figure out the total gain and loss that way. It's easier to bite the bullet and just cash out and pay short term capital gains. Especially since it's free money anyway.I This only account for a small portion of the selling but it is happening.

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't bcash have the same consensus rules as btc? Technically they're no more in charge of bcash then they were off Bitcoin before the fork. They do world significantly more economic control because they own a much greater proportion of coins but as far as forks are concerned they still need consensus. Concentration of wealth is not technically the same thing as centralized control though it's close.

You can still find blocks they just won't have bitcoin in them but there will still be a fee-based reward.

Well done. Futures are a way for companies to hedge against volatility. They are usually not a giant cash grab because they cost too much. They will allow retailers to hold Bitcoin as an asset without bearing the huge risk of the price dropping. They are a form of insurance far more than they are a means of market manipulation. If the price drops after futures launch it will be from nothing other than weak hands.

Psychologically it's a lot easier to believe something that costs less is more likely to multiply in price.

My understanding was that all coins are kept in individual wallets in cold storage. I could be mistaken but that's what the description of their service led me to believe.

You really don't think that AI will devise new, more efficient ways of cracking keys? They are already creating their own languages that are more efficient than what we've taught them.  It seems like a perfect application for AI. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:47:56
I personally feel that the combination of AI and quantum computing will ultimately become the downfall of Bitcoin. It will become a game of cat and mouse and quite frankly, the mouse is not fast enough or agile enough to get away. Upgrades to the bitcoin network take a very long time because consensus needs to be reached. They are also fraught with political bickering that drags out the process. If the community can't come to an agreement on segwit in a timely manner what makes you think they will be able to come to an agreement about the best way to handle quantum computing before everyone's keys are cracked? I don't think it will be a problem for years, maybe even decades but Bitcoin's time will come.

so after nearly every transaction is segwit and there are double the transactions per block the fees may be half of what they are now? then once twice as many people use the blockchain the fees will be right back to where they are currently? what is core's solution to scaling going forward if not an eventual increase in block size? do nearly every transaction on the lightning network?

The complaints about Coinbase are overblown on this sub. It's a great interface and is generally more reliable than most exchanges currently. It also allows you easy access to GDAX which is nice. Their customer support is not great but the site works perfectly fine 99.9% of the time. They had some growing pains but I think most of those are behind them. I will caution you that A. The site often goes down when there are a ton of people using it (durring big bull runs and crashes) but most exchanges do experience degraded performance. And B. if you plan on hodling any significant coin, move it off the exchange and on to cold storage like a hardware or paper wallet. If you don't own your private keys, you don't own your coins.

I wonder why nobody has just done it. A 51% attack on bcash would be extremely expensive, no doubt about it. But there are so many people that have so much to gain from its proven failure. A single 51% attack at this stage would spell the end for bcash and would send bitcoin and probably even some other alts on a run they've never seen before. I'd imagine the attacker(s) could make their money back over night if they held enough bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:13:12
Um- this is exactly the reason bitcoin users want to take the power out of the hands of miners- because of attacks like this. LN intends to take the ability to manipulate fees out of the hands of miners. If anything this just proves the worth of the lightning network and decentralization of hashing power.

There's only about 90K more BCH than BTC and that came about because of the difficulty adjustments. Regardless, currency in circulation doesn't correlate to the usefulness of a coin. I do completely agree that it's naive to dismiss BCH as a non-factor. Things would be going in a very different direction if there wasn't a schism in the community.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:49:26
That's not how forks work. if the BTC was lost before the fork the BCH is also lost. They're identical keys. There were just as many BCH in circulation as BTC at the moment of the fork.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:43:39
I'm not arguing that Bitcoin wasn't in a bubble I'm saying that it had enough of an impact to pop it. More of an impact than the months of China/South Korea rumors and bearish news that the priced pushed upward through. It's already been proven that bitcoin's price is tied to the performance of its rival(if you can even call it that). A significant failure would serve to fortify confidence in BTC. I am of the opinion that there are a lot of people waiting around for the next bull run. The price has been too low for too long. Good news is coming out every day regarding bitcoin (regulatory, development and adoption) and it's poised for a takeoff but needs a catalyst. It's already been proven that bcash's performance can change the tide when the conditions are right.

I wish there were a way for users to reliably signal support for something. Like a wallet signal that couldn't be fudged. Unfortunately I can't think of any way to do this that wouldn't be able to be taken advantage of by someone with the means to setup and support several thousand wallets. Maybe if exchanges gave verified users a vote that may help move toward a truer consensus.

It is if you have consensus. The problem with Segwit 2x was that it didn't have consensus because it was not the right time to raise the block size and it was seen as an attempted power grab. A lot of the Core developers agree that a block size increase will eventually be needed, even with lightning network, though it is not prudent to do so until other efforts of optimizing block space have been exhausted.
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:47:59
I scanned a QR code and sent the BTC equivalent (.000888) of the USD price (8.98 plus the 6 cent optimal fee for a total of 9.04) at that time. It's pretty impractical to prove things in btc at this point due to volatility.

Well some would argue that those fees were artificially inflated by spam and a refusal to utilize segwit/batching. Not enough time was given to proof out the effectiveness of Segwit before jumping to a block size increase. Just because a block size increase wasn't the best answer this time does not mean that it will never be the best answer. It all depends on the circumstances. Hopefully we don't get to that point for a very long time.

You might get a lower price sometime in the next few days or weeks but nothing is guaranteed. I think it's far more likely to go up from here than down considering where the price has already been and the progress that has been made to increased the usability since that time. Bitcoin is more useable now than it was when it was 19K and not just because the user base has dropped; the capacity has increased significantly.

Er, that's not how it works. You can still see a deflationary spiral. In theory the old american dollar (pegged to gold, before the shift to fiat) was also infinitely divisible. The government could have issued notes or coins for fractions of a cent. The reason they didn't is because that does nothing to stop deflation/money hoarding. A deflationary currency generally slows the economy because people are less likely to spend it knowing it will be worth more if they save it. governments currently plan in a slight amount of inflation every year to encourage spending. Since all major world currencies are fiat this isn't a problem as long as you keep your inflation rate in line with other major currencies. Bitcoin has the potential to massively disrupt this current M.O.

They have the highest out of any economically significant country. every Swiss Frank in circulation could disappear and 99% of the world would have no idea. Their population is under 9million people. The united states has over 323 million documented citizens. To prove my point, if you were to combine the GDP of every country with a higher GDP/capita than the US:
luxembourg 63.55B
Switzerland 659B
Norway 377.1B
Macau 80.765B
Ireland 344B
Qatar 404.1B
Iceland 18B
You would get just shy of 2 trillion dollars. The GDP of the US is 18.5Trillion. The GDP of the US is over 9 times that of all the countries "richer" than it combined.

Well there is a free market, there are just limited choices within that market and your possible solution is an excellent example of my point. If there is a better product such as a new ISP that promises not to sensor content, or another network entirely like the one you mention, people will gravitate to it and ISPs will be forced to act accordingly to compete. There are currently no laws against this (Though it is important that no such laws be passed). The end of net neutrality doesn't need to be the end of the golden age of information, though it may well be if we do not continue to fight against prohibitive legislation that raises the cost of entry for new solutions.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:32:04
Free market will theoretically solve this. A lapse in service opens the door for new providers. Don't want comcastcoins? Switch to Verizon. Don't want Verizon coins? Switch to rcn. This is the case with most net neutrality problems.

While I agree that this is the best way forward I am disappointed with the progress made on L2 thus far. We saw multiple lightning network apps being tested before segwit activated but where are they now? why weren't these apps ready to go and why do segwit transactions still only make up 5% of transactions? Also, most of the apps i've seen so far still don't seem as user friendly as I think they need to be. Do you think my parents will be able to figure out what a node is or what opening a channel means? They can barely grasp the concept of a digital currency as it is so adding another layer seems to only further complicate matters given the way most apps I've seen are built. I feel like it could take years for a good LN app to take hold and become used more than on-chain apps and I see this as a major problem moving forward.

What happens if these major nodes all decide that they want an added level of control. Is there any way, in a future where distribution is very low and there are only a few usable hubs, they could collectively stop routing payments and hold the network hostage in order to demand a change? I realize they would be making an economic sacrifice to do this, but if they collectively decided a change in protocol would be beneficial enough to allow more control, could they do it? If not many channels other than the major hubs have the liquidity to route many large transactions how long would it take for the network to recover from an attempted attack? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:59:41

From what I gather, this just simply says that exchanges working in the US should be registered with the SEC. Ones that aren't may be breaking the law.

Increasing the block size a little probably wouldn't but people are afraid that it sets a precedent of increasing block size every time scaling is needed. Some feel that if block size increases enough the blocks will be so big that it will take too much computing power to mine and the small miners just won't be able to keep up. Others argue that speed and memory in the consumer computer market increase exponentially so this shouldn't be a problem. There's obviously a lot more to it but that is my understanding of the basic argument.

Venmo and Square use USD which is controlled and influenced by the federal reserve. Bitcoin is it's own currency that is independent of any government or bank. An encrypted ledger of every bitcoin transaction is kept and shared across the entire network of bitcoin users instead of any financial institution.

Bitcoin's network code actually has a built in speed limit of one block every 10 minutes on average. This is done to level the playing field so that everyone has a chance at mining blocks. This means that the only way to speed things up is more transactions per block. To do this you can either make the blocks bigger or you can make the transaction data smaller. Block increase does the former, Segwit does the ladder.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:40:11

did you confirm the transactions? they will send you a transaction confirmation email to the secondary email you added when you set up your vault. Make sure you check both your primary and secondary email. Once you click the confirmation link they will send you a few countdown emails.

No, I'm saying that you would need to convert it at an exchange that supports BCC. It splits on August 1st regardless of what you do but your private keys will work on both chains. For example. Take all of your coins and put them on a paper wallet tonight. Wait for August 1st. On August 2nd take your keys and deposit it into your coinbase Bitcoin account. Then use those same keys to deposit into a BCC account on OKcoin. (I'm not sure if OKcoin will let you claim both) trade your BCC in for Bitcoin on OKcoin. Transfer bitcoins from both exchanges into your Trezer wallet. You have gained more Bitcoin.

As long as you have access to your private keys they will work on both chains. This means that if you have 1 BTC now (about $2575) after aug 1st you will have both 1 BTC and 1 BCC. combined they may be worth more or less than a BTC now. If you have your coins on Coinbase you don't have access to the private key so if you leave them on there you won't have access to your BCC since they refuse to support it. (which I think is good) the simplest solution is to move your bitcoin to a wallet before aug 1st. keep in mind that if you give someone a key to pay with BCC after aug 1st they could use that on the BTC chain if you haven't already (and vice versa)

Jihan and the big miners want big blocks and are blocking BIP148( which includes the segwit update) from happening, since it would require 95% of miner consent to move forward. The users (people who run fill nodes, not miners) who are for BIP148/segwit have coordinated the user activated soft fork (uasf) in response to the blockage to force the miners hand. The users are basically saying that they won't accept blocks from miners that aren't using the new software.

Transactions will be sketchy after Aug 1 so everyone is stockpiling BTC while they know their purchase is a verified one on a universally accepted chain. I'll be buying both sides of the chain during the possible price dip on 8/1. What I may lose in unsupported coins I'll gain back in moon juice from the other chain. Bitcoin will prevail either way. I have ETH too just in case.

If only it described how bitcoin mining actually worked, this would be extremely useful.

Huge win for the free market. Hopefully other states will follow suit.

No, I meant by the time the hard fork rolls around.

THANK YOU SEGWIT2X
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:04:35
If the hard fork fails, isn't everyone already running SegWit2x code? how could they then ignore segwit blocks? won't nearly all of them be segwit blocks or is segwit an option in each block that will only be used for blocks interacting with a lightning network? Sorry if that question doesn't make sense.

BTC comes in at the price you bought it at with coinbase so the delay doesn't really matter much for HODLers. But if you want to sell quick then connect a card and pay even more insane fees.

Glad to see Coinbase has been working diligently on changing their dashboard layout instead of answering customer service inquiries.

It's not a who but a what. It's a software code upgrade that segregates the witness in transactions. It frees up more space in blocks so that transactions can get verified faster and cheaper. It also allows transactions to happen off of the block chain through what's called a lightning network. Google these things for more info. I am not qualified enough to accurately describe them in detail.

Well, if you bought it for cheaper than it is right now, you will make a profit selling now. Though if you hold it and the price goes higher, you would make even more profit. Although (and here lies the tough decision), if you don't sell and the price goes down from here, you will make less profit. Hope this helps =).

Take a look at the prices for the past week. Last night saw an uncharacteristically steep uptick in price (I believe there may have been a bit of a buying frenzy in Japan which we could see again tonight). The price stabilized right about where it should have been if the price had continued on the linear gain it's seen for the past week. Any extremely sharp jumps will inevitably see a correction shortly after. Any major drops should only follow a massive blow to market confidence brought about by outside conditions, not from a holder dump of coins. I haven't seen anything in the news that would suggest a large confidence shakeup any time in the next month. People will continue buying in anticipation of the fork, since transactions immediately after the fork will be risky.

Also, the argument for segwit general prevails in r/Bitcoin while the argument against segwit generally prevails in r/BTC. This may help further your research efforts.

Not sure a 5 year old could understand it but I'll try. So right now it takes too long and costs too much for a transaction to go through because unlocking the blocks that hold the transactions is hard and there are too many blocks waiting to be unlocked. so people have proposed 2 main solutions. one is make the blocks bigger and the other is make the stuff that goes in the blocks smaller. Most people seem to support doing both of these things but the argument seems to be about which one to do first.
Some people don't want to make the blocks too big because then only really big people (lots of computing power) can open the blocks. They say if we make it bigger once now, what's to stop us from making it bigger again and again until only the strongest can mine the bitcoin. They want to make the stuff in the blocks smaller and do most of the small transactions(or parts of them anyway) on this thing called the lightning network which is supposed to be fast (like lightning). The idea of doing this is called segwit and has been pretty well thought out and has already been used on some other coins. This upgrade would be implemented by whats called a user activated soft fork on 8/1. think of it as a bunch of people getting so pissed off with how shitty things are that they are willing to drag everyone who is against it, kicking and screaming into their new way of working with coins. if most people decide to go this way, anyone who traded the old style coins after 8/1 will basically be screwed. If it half works there will be 2 bitcoins. if it doesn't work everyone gets grumpy and goes back to trading using the old rules.
Others say that no matter what, we'll need to make the blocks bigger to make bitcoin usable and since computing power grows exponentially with time, it doesn't really matter if we make the blocks bigger. They think we can worry about making the stuff in the blocks smaller when making the blocks bigger starts to cause problems because right now, the way that the blocks would be made smaller could offer an opportunity for people to take unfair advantage of the update. They think that it's too risky to make the stuff that goes in the blocks smaller right now. They want a hard fork which means that basically everyone agrees to it and anyone who doesn't can go eat doodoo.
Either way, the moonride will not be a smooth one.

Thank you for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:17:47
No, as long as you don't make any additional transactions until a prevailing chain is established you'll be fine. There will likely be some price turbulence but it will recover. You should be able to hodl right through it with no problem.

Try going over over to you'll get a more representative response there. People will likely just tell you that they're greedy over here.
