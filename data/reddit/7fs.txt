Really..... What are you a cop!? Doing that is the beginning of a slippery slope towards total censorship...
People get information from a lot more places than Wikipedia, and it would be unwise to be performing searches about commiting crimes on your home internet. Many a criminal have been caught that way.

Thank you sir 😏
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:49:40
Noob question but you would have to backup the wallet all the time to prevent against theft? Is there a way you could just set a macro to send your fees to another wallet automatically? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:12:44
Ooh really? I thought I read Satoshi saying that you could run a node and collect fees 
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:23:57
Wow that's fuckin hilarious!! I gues the irs fucked themselves over in that case
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:34:43
What would be the point? Do those coins go there to die? Lol
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:20:08
Whoa... Lol 
Cool thanks for the clarification 
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:39:35
Probably a pointless question but is there a point for that? And are they presumably lost forever?
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:26:41
Cool I had the same question, now if I print a wallet with let's say 1 key for 1btc, and then I send an additional 1btc to this address, will another private key be generated that I need? Or does that key containing the 1btc now contain 2?
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:45:58
Wow, fuckin  you just blew my mind
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:53:43
Yep bitadress.org baby! I think blockchain.info has instructions on making and securing paper wallets
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:06:35
Lovewill LLC, has an app in beta for the iPhone, called 'pheeva' works great I tested it for everything. I'll find a link fr you guys, they also got back to me promptly over twitter every time, good guys!
EDIT: here it is!! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:07:15
Lol no one should support cibc(not trying to be rude) they have a bad track record... Nor do I like rbc after that outsourcing
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:56:33
Oooh ok so then is there still some kind of 'incentive' for running a full node?
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:02:22
Thy will charge a fee but the way a 'co-op' works is they will redistribute profits from advertisement supposedly.... So we'll see but your 10$ a year fee may end up making you money in the long run if it takes off. I listened to them explain it on ltbtc podcast, but I don't fully understand it. But yes if it's only $10 it will be a very good option. And as for phee a storing your keys? For the average iphone user that's best case scenario...... Guys as were learning from mtgox, companies will be increasingly held accountable for their actions on the blockchain, AND liable legally in most cases. I mean it's not like COG is hiding their identity, I have the fkin dev on twitter, his private account they are chill dudes trying to help us all. At some point we have to support them
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:43:21
That's crazy, so he resurfaced to tell us that?!
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:21:19
Ah that brought me a smile after reading his pain hahaha
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:39:07
Ooh so it's good if I'm making a lot of transactions then. Awesome thanks for the clarification man
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:40:54
Wow awesome! I was only hoping it was that easy, (complex?)... So I can create an address, print to paper wallet, leave it in a safe and just send btc worry free? All the while monitoring the balance via blockchainn? Again just wanting to triple check as lost btc is bad btc haha
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:28:08
Cool! Thanks a ton for the help I gotta say, while reddit has only the best of trolls, at r/bitcoin, I have met some really helpful people! Thanks!
Edit: and I'll definitely look into bip
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:52:50
Yes, this is literally a good option! I bet mcafee has these all over haha, and I know he's got 3 or 4 giant belizeian dudes to hold for him haha
@_date: 2014-04-01 06:55:33
For sure! Glad to help!
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:57:41
This coming from a newb around here myself, you guys have all been extrememly helpful, and thanks to a little dedication, and guidance from /r bitcoin, I know own bitcoins of my own that are secured in cold storage! 
Thanks reddit! 👌👌🙏
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:32:03
Whoa, ok but so by doing that they then don't have to share any of the 25? And I mean with the network for transaction fees? Shit kinda confusing as I thought when the block was mined someone got 25 and other miners got ADDITIONAL coins from trans. fees. Do I have that right? I thought the fees were added to the 25btc in other words, not subtracted?
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:25:29
My thoughts exactly, thanks for keepin us all motivated haha
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:07:38
I would not be surprised if it is because a lot of the 'lost money' belongs to some pissed off people that want him dead, and live in America hahaha
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:08:02
Yep. 😒
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:35:02
Thanks man! Big help!
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:46:42
It's fine, I have money and btc in there, and all is well. I talked to them last week, they are changing banks, and supposedly we will be able to set them up as a "bill payee" like visa or your cell contract. Then you can just send them money for a much cheaper rate. Until then I used bank draft, I know it's really bad buisness not to put those updates on the site tho....
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:34:03
Same I have one and lost 200$ already haha, and all I can think of is 'buy MOAR!'
@_date: 2014-03-22 05:41:49
Bit stamp was audited to am I correct?
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:46:55
Lol WOW!
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:04:25
Wtf so they just solve the blocks to get the transaction fees??? And destroy the 25 btc then?
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:05:43
Keep it up and you WILL be Canadians exchange of choice for sure! This excites me greatly, as lately I have been having to make trips to Vancouver(I'm in the burbs) to trade cad-btc so I can use and spend it! 
Big ups!! Will be switching all over to you guys
