Interesting, seems like it'd be a fairly easy lawsuit, especially if they're targeting people with money for these hacks. Guess it's just a matter of time until someone goes after them for giving away their information and regulation on them tightens up a bit.

I believe with the gains being a bit less than they were in Q4 '17, it's a little more difficult to make much off just trading from one to another currency. Maybe if you've got large sums to invest, to the point where you can scoop up a huge market share of a coin, artificially raise the buy price, then manage to sell off that share you have you could do it...But that'd be quite an exercise.

It's great (and somewhat interesting) that such a large company is trying out a crypto, particularly that they're trying out a stable coin for an internal system, rather than just using transfers. The fees are probably a big part of this, and the volatility of the market plays a part in their choice to use a stablecoin. Interesting indeed!

Depends on your phone service but I've heard of being able to have them port over the number to a different sim card that you can then use temporarily. Other than that, do you have access to the email you used to set up coinbase? Through that you might be able to contact coinbase and see if you can email in a copy of your ID or something to get your account back if it was verified.

Bad chart is bad. BTC isn't $10,100 either...

Unless they're offering interest rates or a set exchange rate on withdrawals, what's the point of a cryptobank, just keep your wallet in a protected environment...Just my .02, I could admittedly be way offbase!

Couldn't you then sue the carrier? Assuming they're literally social engineering to gain access, that'd make the carrier at fault. If the person doing the 'social engineering' had your account number/pin though (my phone company requires my number and pin to discuss my account, same with a lot of my other products I use that handle sensitive info) then you're kinda SOL.

Cool guide, thank you! 
I'm not OP but still, thanks!

Don't push people who are interested in something away from it! Bringing more people to crypto and btc is great, we don't need to be gatekeeping when having a bigger audience helps us all!

The bigger takeaway here is the sports betting app she's advertising. If they're accepting btc and other crypto, that'll be a bigger push than just having a random adult film actress advertising. Obviously the amount of followers helps (assuming 10% are bots, 10% are 'shills', and finding that only about 3.7% are active), if even .1% of her followers decide to try that site out and get a bit of crypto it could be enough to move some needles...But again that's simply because of the amount of followers, not who's doing the posting/what the post is for. At the same time, a lot of people are over saturated by postings like this by now, they know what crypto is and they're not too interested in it (it's been several years since they heard about it first, never got into it, why get into it now?).
In the end, not great, not bad.

If you control 1-2% of the market, you'd be a whale since you can have a major effect on the market and perception of the market. If someone with 1% or hell even possibly even .5% of the market decided to sell off their shares at 10-15% under market, it could cause a ripple effect sending the market down.

That's fantastic! When did you get most of your donations? I'm guessing around December of '17 things either slowed down on the donation side of things, or really picked up right?
