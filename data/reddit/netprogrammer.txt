~~Do not use them!!!! They do not reply to customer requests. I do not have access to my account and asked them to resend me my access data.~~
~~They did not reply at all. Dont use their service, at least not by paying. If they think this is ok what they do, create emails, use vpn/proxy and get daily access for free without to pay anything. Maybe then they will find time to give support to their customers.~~
They replied finally to me. It works, but many channels do hang, when I connect over US IP, then US channels work well, when connecting in EU, then russian and Ex-Yu mostly work (HD hangs) but DE and AT hangs. 
The same issue when I am not going over VPN.
All in all, it is not bad if it works and if you get support, lets hope that I was just exclusion. Most channels work, even they hang.
I tested it with VLC, where my network settings (which include QoS and other optimizations) were optimized for streaming.
If you use original card for german Sky, austrian ORF or swiss SRF, then sometimes macroblocks appear even if share server and client are less then 10km away from each other, where no performance issues or network latency are the reason. I do assume that they use cccam by themself, based on the issue with ORF which is well known by using.
Russian channels seem to be on faster server, they worked better then EU's services, I did not check the bandwith, but it could be the case.
My conclusion is, if they get faster and more reliable network/vpn :)/servers closer to their customers, then they will be pretty amazing. I am unsure about their support, they did reply but it took them very long.
