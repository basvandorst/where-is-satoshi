tx fees go to miners, not to exchanges

Bitstamp - SegWit, batched transactions and no BTC withdrawal fees
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:52:43
I like Bitstamp - they have both batched transactions and SegWit... And there are no BTC withdrawal fees...

Thanks a lot for this, just tried sending to both  and  and both transactions were without any problems... I'm really looking forward to lightning on mainnet...

As you can see on  [ there were just two incoming and two outgoing transactions in the whole history (one In and one Out in December 2017 and one In and one Out 2 days ago). If this was target address of some (very old) automated attack, surrely there would be much more than just one previous incoming TX...
Plus if this was some sort of automated attack, funds would be probably lost immediately after that initial bigger deposit of 5.63 BTC.
So IMHO someone send those (stolen) BTC to [1C3tZZKPj6cQ8GsFh513sPZKqE6PPVgCBY]( manually, and I don't understand why would he do address reuse

It seems very strange to me that the address  [ to which attacker sent the stolen BTC is not new, but was previously used in December 2017! Why would the attacker do that? Seems a little too silly to steal someone's funds and then link that transaction directly to own previous transactions from 2 years ago just by address reuse...

You can look at list of all contributors to source code repository for yourself -

Exactly, I haven't realized it before - next time I'll always wait with small low priority transactions for the weekend
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:21:19
It seems so, according to  they've signalled SegWit in two blocks already... 
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:02:59
I agree... I didn't mean to imply SegWit is not needed

I'm posting this, because after reading quite a lot of posts about how expensive and slow Bitcoin transactions are lately, I was pleasently surprised to see how quickly transaction with very low fee (20.265 sat/B; total fee 0.0000458 BTC) can be confirmed.
(I realize Sunday morning isn't the busiest time, but still...)
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:33:33
There were just two when I posted this... and now there are three more blocks from Antpool that does NOT signal Segwit
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:07:28
I didn't try to prove anything, I just posted what I noticed (in one specific case)
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:06:14
That's really not good...
I use Trezor and it always sets the fees dynamically based on selected priority and on number of transactions waiting for confirmation. This morning I used "Economic" fee level, which is 2nd lowest (of 4).
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:01:41
OK, good to know
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:59:20
Well, IMHO it is... at least considering the fee I used
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:58:17
Isn't there a difference that BIP148 node will start orphaning non-SegWit blocks on August 1st and BIP91 node before that (just after next 313 blocks according to 
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:03:48
And do you have version 2.8.10 (the latest one)? I didn't have them in the previous version either...

How is it possible to confiscate someone's bitcoins?
