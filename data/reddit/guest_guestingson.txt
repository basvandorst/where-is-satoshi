If someone is in the market to buy btc, yes, they should buy regardless of price.   


However much they are comfortable with potentially losing.    


They should hold as long as they'd like. However, the topic of conversation is around ***buying*** btc, not selling btc or spending btc. But simply buying btc. 


As long as they are in the market to buy, yes. They should buy whenever they are in the market to do so. 
I have personally bought btc when the price was over $1,000 and under $250. Every time I bought some btc I was in the market to do so. The price doesn't matter because the price is not predictable. Timing the market is impossible. If someone is in the market to buy btc they should do so regardless of price simply because the price is irrelevant and they are in the market to buy.     
Do you get it now? Or would you like to continue to beat a dead horse? 
It's really not a difficult concept to understand. Allow me to take it a step further. 
I literally just went to the grocery store to buy eggs. Why? Because I was in the market to do so. The price of the eggs is irrelevant simply because the price of eggs tomorrow, 1 year and 5 years from now is unpredictable and irrelevant. I was in the market to buy eggs today.... so I bought some eggs. I bought an amount that I believe I will consume before they go bad. And if they do go bad before I finish them, it's okay, because the amount of money I would have lost for simply not eating the eggs is an amount of money I'm comfortable with losing.   
I don't NEED to buy btc and I don't NEED to buy eggs. However, I'm in the market to buy both. Therefore, I will buy regardless of price. Once again, it's called dollar cost averaging.

@_date: 2016-06-12 17:35:48
The price is irrelevant. Just buy and hold. Never sell back to fiat. If you want to use it, actually use it to buy goods and services in the future. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:58:51
I don't think so at all. Care to elaborate your point of view?

Lol I wouldn't say it's a twisted example. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:49:11
A better example would be someone in a blue car driving to their favorite restaurant which is 10 minutes away. However, police are redirecting traffic specifically for blue cars. All blue cars need to take a detour which causes the 10 minute drive to the restaurant to be a 3 hour drive instead. It's not the restaurants fault that police are discriminating against blue cars. The end user experience is shit due to blatant discrimination from the police redirecting traffic of blue cars.

The context we're talking about is purchasing bitcoin given its current price. The point I'm making is that the price doesn't matter. The price is irrelevant. It's always a good idea for someone who is in the market to buy bitcoin to do so regardless of price. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:12:46
I'll take that as yes, you understand what I'm saying and realize your point of view is invalid.

Am i the only one that sees Purse.io as a killer app? I've literally saved over a thousand dollars using purse. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:25:19
Honestly? I feel like I could write a 5 page paper in response to your question but I'll attempt to be brief.  
I believe bitcoin and fiat can coexist like email and snail mail. Therefore it makes sense to purchase a little bit of bitcoin on a regular basis aka dollar cost average. Disregard the price because the price is irrelevant. Never convert bitcoin back to fiat. ***The end game is to have multiple stores of wealth.*** One in fiat, one in cryptocurrencies, one in the stock market, one in the bond market, one in illiquid assets (like a house) etc. Selling your bitcoin for fiat is like printing out an email and then sending it by way of snail mail. Sure you can do that and there's nothing wrong with it. But why not just send it by way of email? 
Bitcoin is not meant to replace fiat. It's meant to solve some of the problems that exist with fiat. Bitcoin is eventually going to get to a point where you won't need to sell it. Just like how I can use my debit card almost anywhere. I don't need to use my debit card at an ATM to withdraw cash before buying my groceries. I can just swipe my debit card. Bitcoin will get to the same level of convenience.  
As it stands right now, I think the best strategy is to buy and hold. Hold until you are showing a positive return and then decide whether or not you want to spend your btc or save it. As it stands, anyone can use btc to get a 30% discount on Amazon by way of purse.io. Anyone can use bitcoin to get 20% off at Starbucks by way of Fold. Should you use your btc on amazon and fold if you're currently down 50% from your principal investment? Well, no. That wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. Should you use BTC on purse.io if you're up 10, 20, or even 1,000%? Sure, why not?  
All in all. I think the absolute best strategy as it stands right now is to buy bitcoin and then immediately replace it when you spend it.   
Example: I recently purchased something on purse.io that costs $200. It ended up costing me around $160. After spending the btc, I immediately replaced it. Why? Well because at the end of the day, I still ended up getting $40 off of my purchase and my wealth in btc remained the same. I simply used btc to get a discount.   
***Diversify your store of wealth.*** Have a level of wealth in a variety of asset classes in order to hedge yourself from risk in the other asset classes. 
Does that answer your question? Does that make sense?
So much for being brief.

If you immediately replace the btc you're spending then it doesn't matter if you're up or down. If you're not immediately replacing then it doesn't make sense to spend your btc while down from your initial investment. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:48:12


Perhaps you don't know what in the market means. Here.... 
     
Being "in the market" simply means you want to buy something. Period. No other factors. OP wants to buy btc. He is in the market to buy btc. No reason to make it any more complicated than that. My advice to him is yes, buy btc... regardless of its current price.  
 What is your advice to OP? To wait for the price to go down? Down to what? How do you know the price will go down? What if it never does? Should OP therefore never buy btc? What if it continues to rise  $100 / day? What's your advice then?   
What is your advice to OP? His questions was should he buy now. My answer was yes. What is your answer? When should OP buy btc? When should OP buy the thing he is in the market to buy?
Can you even answer that? Or is the purpose simply to argue with someone online for the sole purpose of arguing online?

Why did you hash tag bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:54:24


Yes. However that's not what's happening.   
The amount being produced is being cut in half from 25btc / 10 minutes now down to 12.5btc / 10 minutes.   
Hence halving.

There's nothing to suggest the brexit had any impact on bitcoin's price. After the announcing of the brexit, nothing out of the ordinary happened with bitcoin. Everyday normal volatility happened. The Bitcoin market is too thinly traded to not see some type of impact.

It's reasonable to assume OP is in the market to buy btc otherwise he wouldn't have asked. Because OP is in the market (nothing was "snuck in"), my point is valid. 
And no, those statements were not contradictions. It's called dollar cost averaging.

I definitely agree services for end users is important. But isn't the network only capable of 3-7 transactions per second? Isn't that a huge problem for mainstream adoption? Shouldn't core development on addressing this problem be a top priority before having entrepreneurs flood the network with their services?

Anything from a 1 - 100 point drop I don't even really pay attention to. If it goes down too low where I feel like I should sell and recoup my money I buy instead and lower my cost basis.  
I follow the strategy of never sell always buy. Every time I panic and want to sell I buy. Going too low? Buy. Going too high? Buy.  
By following this method I'm currently up 5 figures and I've been following this strategy for 3 years.   
Bitcoin is not get rich quick. Bitcoin is watch and learn.

So I'm kind of confused. I thought the reason transactions sometimes didn't confirm for hours or sometimes got canceled was because blocks were full and too many transactions were happening in the network.

@_date: 2016-07-02 12:03:26
To a degree, certainly. The way I look at it (and let's be real, my opinion doesn't mean shit) there are some very intelligent scientist working on bitcoin development. Plenty of people identifying weaknesses and developing ways to improve bitcoin to prepare for mainstream adoption. Segwit, lightning network, and a bunch of different BIPs, which I know nothing about, all have potential to increase the stability and value of bitcoin. 
I believe bitcoin needs slow and steady growth. Let the experts breathe. Give them some time. We want this done right, not quickly. 
If mainstream adoption happens before the network is ready, we'll likely experience a "bubble" like effect of adoption and abandonment and then too many people left with a bad taste in their mouth. 
But then again... what the fuck do I know?

Tell your wife you're increasing your 401k contributions, have a steady flow of money into your own checking account. Now you have a long term solution to spend your money however you want. 
Short term solution. 
Stop being such a pussy and take the hard earned money you work for and spend it however you like without fear of your wife. You're a man. You have a job. You work hard. If your wife tries to bully you then you stand up for yourself and you tell her "I bought some bitcoin." If she doesn't like it you tell her it was your decision with your money.  You're a man. You have a set of testicles.
