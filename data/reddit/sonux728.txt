I dont know to be honest.
I have seen almost all setting never seen such a thing.

Okay bro.
2 questions:
How to combine them?
How will I know that congestion have ended.
Sorry for the noob questions.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:05:19


okay, thank you for explaining in simple terms.
I will keep this in mind next time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:30:26
Will surely learn my lesson.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:09:17
TO be honest, sometimes its there and sometimes not.
I am serious.
When I try to send money via electrum, even if I pay 50$ fee on 200$ tx I get the error mempool fee is not met, something like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:43:02
Sorry I am not to experienced so I dont understand what you are trying to say.
I sent it via blockchain.info wallet to a friend.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:34:06
are you sure?
because I dont see any money in my blockchain acc and on electrum also there is no money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:38:34
By output you mean sending address?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:23:14
TO be honest, i cant understand most of the replies here.
Can somebody tell me that do I have the money or not?
Blockchain says my balance is 35$ and electrum shows this:
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:07:33
So should i accept the fact that money is gone??
And how did you calculated this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:14:03
I think so.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:56:40
What can be done now bro?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:48
Here is the link:
I paid confirmtx and it have failed.
viabtc says tx doesnt exist.
Electrum CPFP says max fee exceeded.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:02:26


I have already imported everything to electrum.
But cant seem to figure out the next step.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:42:11
I am in no hurry.
So when congestion I send 2-3 tx and it will solve the issues?
And thnx for helping out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:30:01
I am fucked. lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:45:57
I cant answer as I have no idea what you are talking about.
