The only option in Mycellium is CPFP and it's easy not to check that 'replace by fee' in Elec.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:49:04
I get that, but if they took every transaction then people wouldn't be using the CPFP which then adds *another* 190 bytes. More stuck transactions = fewer transactions per block because they take up more space.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:36:52
There should be no 'stuck' transactions. There already exists a method to 'unstick' your transaction and that's to pay the miners an even higher bountry. There is no incentive at all for the miners to increase hashrate and unclog the system.
Miner greed is screwing us all.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:26:13
I've been using it since before OP and up until the redonculous fees started happening it was a great currency.
I've been going into the same coffeeshop near me each week for over 5 years and a couple months ago I paid cash for the first time. The mempool backlog has got so big that if you don't pay a $10 premium you don't get confirmed at all.
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:35:21
No. It won't change until the miners start taking all the transactiins again instead of only taking ones offering high fee$.
Make a stink. The miners have to hear about it. Replace By Fee is screwing us all.

Reddit being the echo chamber that it is makes people think everyone knows about bitcoin. Only the last few months has it become well known.
That '1%' of places is still 100 times more places than any other crypto. Online, you would be suprised how many and in some cities too.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:27:15
The difficulty is determined by expected vs. actual time right? If the miners leave orphan transactions to fester then they will prematurely seal blocks and have a bogus rate which makes them **look** fast.
Adding hashrate **must** be coupled with a complete clearing of the mempool or the difficulty is increased prematurely.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:06:09
Competing for blockspace ensures ever increasing fees. Miners gamed the system by choosing only transactions with high rewards and now we have 180,000+ stuck transactions.
Initially, miners were to take transactions first come first served.
BTC is officially useless as a currency for merchants if transactions fees make it prohibitive to actually spend BTC on stuff.

A backlog in the mempool indicates the difficulty is 'too high' to actually clear the *entire* mempool. Does that make sense?
Dificulty is recalculated on interval based on *expected* vs. *actual*, so we need to look at **why** the miners cannot meet demand when they could before. The 'easy' answer is to shorten the job. I don't care to discuss the well argued solutions around that dead horse. What I think is there is a much simpler solution.
**If the miners did their job and 'left no transactions behind' then each block would take that little bit extra to mine and result in a slightly lower difficulty. It's a classic** '[**I love Lucy' feedback blunder.**](

@_date: 2018-01-14 11:24:54
If someone buys an item with BTC and submits a low fee transaction, then their transaction is kinda guaranteed to get stuck these days right? When that person goes to Google and types 'stuck BTC transaction' they will find umpteen sites explaining the CPFP procedure.
If the payment is important enough that person will use the feature which results in 2 transactions. The original transaction is some number of bytes and the CPFP transaction is some number of bytes.
Because blocks are limited in size to a loosely set total number of bytes, the extra bytes mean fewer transactions in the block. Feer transactions per block means the miners fall behind.
So far as I know, a CPFP transaction is about 190 bytes. I think it was a bad move to introduce the option. It would have been better if the transaction was simply rejected and the user submitted a fresh transaction.

You are delusional. Were still at 20 or so transactions per second. Notice the 'outputs per transaction' graph, big players are getting wise and the number of 'timestamp' zero fee near zero value transactions are dissapearing.


The fees went down and the price is still crazy high. You need to work on your FUD game, this bollocks impresses noone.

CPFP still forces the high fee **and** takes up more blockspace.
When users realize how much miners make per transaction in BTC block rewards they are gonna be pissed.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:44:24
No transactions are 'trivial'. Noobs like you are hilarious.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:57:53
Number of transactions per day outpaced hashrate a few months ago. If there was hash to spare we would have no backlog and no reason to pay the bounty.
Are you aware that miners get 12.5+ BTC (about $200k) per block? About 2000 transactions per block means $100 **per** transaction.
Another 20-30 bucks puts only a bit extra in their pocket but hobbles the entire system. Instead of buying lambos and letting 'the Chinese' do it, we need more miners globally.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:02:30
Down to 38,000 unconfirmed in the mempool and sub $1 transaction fees. Why would anyone complain now? If it was a good idea last november then it's still a good idea now.
The 'peak' only lasted a few days. If we are at the new floor then we should be stoked to be 10x higher than last year. If it goes to 5 or 3k that is way up in my books. The only people complaining are the noobs who bought in at $13k.
A good play right now is to pick up some of those alts which dropped even more than BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:08:12
I'm certain it's RBF and CPFP. If you wanted to get rid of nuicance transactions then force a tiny minimum fee but the whole 'highest bidder' has put users at the mercy of traders.

@_date: 2018-01-14 11:17:06


I get that but when someone uses CPFP to 'rescue' their stuck transaction then 2 transactions need to be in the block. 2 transactions take up more byte space.


Exactly. That increase needs to be sufficient to clear the mempool before another difficulty adjustment. Orphaned transactions would be easier to clear if they didn't have the CPFP tagging along.

Yeah. And compared to the block reward (over 12BTC right now = $300000 for 2000 transactions) your 'miner fee' is pretty small.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:53:04
No, I meant the tx fee should be relative to the amount of hashpower it takes to seal the block.
I realize the difficulty of PoW increases, but so do the max hashrate of the ASIC computers. Just because the price of BTC went up 20 times in a few months shouldn't mean the tx fee should also be 20 times larger. Miners are rewarded with BTC (25BTC? = a quarter million dollars!) which went up in value too right?
We are all getting screwed and the miners are not saying anything.

@_date: 2017-12-25 04:55:48
The miners are already rewarded for completing blocks, I think I read 25BTC. The transaction fee should be in proportion to the work(hashpower) they did. At this rate it will soon be 1million Satoshi/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:16:58
I bet they can.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:57:27

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:04:34
After reading the article exposing 'Spoofy' and 'Picasso' market manipulation on Coinbase I can't help but think that someone associated with the miners is bumping the miner fee artificially in a similar manner.
If a bad actor put through loads of small transactions with 1000sat/byte would it compel regular users to chose higher fees in hopes of quicker transaction times?

*Don't invest recklessly* is sage advice but the content of OP's post is short on rational thought.
If we could convert all the BTCs in the world right now into the cash they are supposedly worth it would only float the US army for 4 months. A lot of people think bitcoin is huge and it is, but it is dwarfed by the real world numbers of how much cash money shifts around the world on a daily basis.
Claims like


are total bollocks. If BTC makes it to $100k and all 24 million are mined the total number wouldn't even pay 1/8th of the U.S national debt. Anyone who thinks that kind of pocket change will collapse our economic system is either still in high school or totally unaware of the magnitude of the global banking system.

It seems the others didn't understand what you asked.
When you make a transaction, the miners include your transaction in the block they work on. When that block is sealed, it produces a unique hash (string of characters) which is then used in the next block, eventually creating another hash. Using the previous fingerprint/hash ensures that if a block is fucked with, everyone can tell right away because even one number different produces a unique and different hash which wouldn't match the next block's hash or the next or the next or the next etc.
Your transaction does not change *previous* blocks but it's presence effects every block forward throughout the network.
Fuck me for giving a simple answer eh? Don't let the kiddies here turn you off, it's good to ask questions.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:09:59
I agree. The fees are being gamed.
Also, as BTC price has risen the sat/b has stayed near constant. That is the bullshit part! The tx fee should jive with the hashpower, not pinned to the coin's price.

IOTA is working their way into the European auto makers, the new secure Brave browser uses Basic Attenton Tokens, they could prove popular.

This is one of the worst analysis I have ever read. 
It's also a day or two late.
The reason market corrected down was that China was going gangbusters on it to the point that chinese exchanges were posting prices much much higher than everyone else. Look at their volumes over the week before the tumble. When their price dropped, everyone else freaked out too.
Anyway, it's marching back as we all know it will. To the moon!

BTC split twice just recently. BCH is BitcoinCash and BTG is BitcoinGold. Everyone who had Bitcoin back in August got equivalent number of BCH which now trades around $1500 and everyone who had bitcoin earlier this month got an equivalent number of BTG which is now around $350.

This alone tells me you are naiive when it comes to global economics.
See, say 1 satoshi is a penny. That would make each bitcoin $1million. OMG you say, inconceivable! (In your best Vissini voice) but multiply that million times the 24million total bitcoins and you get 24Trillion. Sounds like a lot to a McDonald's employee but the US national debt sits at about 20Trillion dollars **right now**.
Let that sink in. 1BTC = $1Million and it would barely settle the American's debt. The global derivatives market is around a **Quadrillion** dollars.

I understand that the growth is crazy but it would seem the miners are unfairly taking advantage of us by not adjusting the Satoshi based reward accordingly.
At $100 or $1000 per coin a 0.6mBTC was almost unnoticable but at $10,000 (some people here saying $100k and $700k/coin) it becomes dollars per transaction and that is outright gouging.

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:29:57
My point was that the amount of money circulating globally is massive and dwarfs bitcoin. When someone says a $200k bitcoin would only happen if economies are collapsing is not aware of just how much money we collectively use to keep the world rolling.
Right now BTC has a $170Billion market cap but that would only float the US army for 4 months.

Not inconceivable. I always thought the tip top would be $10,000 but I assumed the banks would try to kill BTC once it got popular. Now that Visa &amp; MasterCard are going to use it and fund managers are jumping in, I am convinced $100,000 is very likely.

Yes. I have an acquaintance here I've been talking to about this, he exclusively uses Electrum and we agreed zero fee transactions rarely go through anymore. The fee right now on his setup is 0.144mBTC which is about a $1.20 or $1.50 Canadian.
This is all gonna flop if it keeps up like this. I'm totally disillusioned and I'm a big fan who's been actively promoting this in my IRL community for years.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:10:13


If I was moving 100k maybe I wouldn't care but I'm buying a $3 coffee. I do this on a weekly basis and have been for years. The point of BTC is general use, not just for high value transactions. $5 transaction fees are prohibitive even if my payment was $100. What I'm saying is that 4 or 5 years ago I bought the same coffee from the same store and payed using the same wallet client except back then it was a fraction of a penny.
Miners calculate the reward as Satoshis per byte so as BTC goes up, so do the fees. Now we have gotten to the point that sure my coins are worth a lot, but my actual use hasnt changed much. If the coffee was now worth $5000 then I wouldn't be here complainig.


I live near a pretty tech savvy area and no retailer around here even knows what 'altcoin' means. If they know anything about crypto, they know BTC and that's because for the last 5 years or so people have been promoting the shit out of BTC being good for business.

You can buy from anyone anywhere. The difficult part is for you to send the money but if you have Western Union then no problem.
Make sure you trust the person because for sure they will want to recieve the cash money first. Most people in the Reddit BTC community are probably not going to rob you but it's impossible to find them if they do.
Do you have a relative you trust in a country where it's easy to buy BTC? If you can instruct them to do it then you can retreive them at your home by email.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:00:33
0.2% of total but not 0.2% of the current order books. The price tanks during big sells because they don't use stop/limit orders and so it runs the buy list right down before anyone can react.
If they were to give everyone a heads up next time it would be less dramatic.

This. Make at least one purchase a week.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:45:37
Yes. On most exchanges, even big ones, there are incremental buy prices which go down down down. If you sell a ton of coins at 'market' price then it will eat up those buys. If you time it right the last sell will be at a substantially lower price than the buy, the price would appear to be dropping so traders would be compelled to reset sell prices and it would trigger sell orders at the lower price.

Well, you know that one of the nice things about untracable wallets is that if she divorces you and wants half your bitcoin, she'd be shit outta luck.

3% charge eh? Plus an unfavorable rate.

Nothing after the decimal point? I dilligently kept all my tiny change amounts. One day we will build a bridge to the moon with it.

One or less.

He was just pissed it jumped before he got n large and wanted to buy in on the inevitable dip he would cause by talkin' shit. It's like a goddamned sit-com.

That can't possibly be, I am the real Satoshi Nakamoto!
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:43:56
My bad. I wore my lucky socks yesterday. That must be it.

Tangle is not IOTA.


I am interested in crypto because of the promise to **de**centralize.
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:50:47
Your paranoid opinon. Also it isn't a working key, it's a puzzle.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:21:29
Remember Myspace? Neither does anyone else.

Won't find it there.

So, it is powerful because it "you don't need a third party like a bank" but you do need a "network of miners" **who demand fees**. Good to know.

Edit: read your comment history, not worth my time.

Bbbut the sky is faaaaaling.

Prove I have some.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:57:15
They already have. Both visa and mastercard have blockchain APIs.
@_date: 2018-07-04 01:01:06
millibit. You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:12:26
Maybe a big one after the fork eh.

Begged my bros to get in at $250 now they are asking how to do it at $5000+. Lol.

If 1 Satoshi = 1 penny then each BTC will be a million bucks. Does anyone actually think bitcoin will fend off the competition long enough to get there tho?

Did he make money off that? Does he get all the 'unclaimed' ones after a time?

Brain or gtfo.

Your friend is talking out his ass. There are plenty of criticisms but those aren't even logical. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:19:46
That is what They want you to think...
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:35:50
Look up 'tangle' which makes the blockchain obsolete. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:03:52
Check out what happened in July 2014 as we could be in a similar part of the pattern. If so, expect a sharp drop after the whales dump around 7 or 8 grand. I predict $3k and for it to stay there for at least a year before the next bubble.
My 'conspiracy theory' hunch however is that Bitfinex is artificially pumping the price somehow to build up a war chest. Whatever the reason, look at July 2014.

Except for the miners who are quickly becoming more and more centralized.
