The OP is doing the very same thing by putting the blame on Bitcoin.  Using energy is not a sin.  The real problem is that we still use dirty energy sources that pollute our planet and that is a problem that existed long before Bitcoin.  If anything, Bitcoin is helping to raise awareness about energy consumption and how not to do it.

The vendor in this case is the broker and they are presenting an invoice denominated in Bitcoin and your obligation is fulfilled when you send the Bitcoin.  What happens after you send the Bitcoin does not change the fact that you paid using Bitcoin.  What the intermediary does with the Bitcoin has no affect on how and what I used to pay.

BCH doesn't solve a use case.  There is no compelling reason to use or support it.  Their daily transactions are less than daily Bitcoin transactions in the year 2012 and before.

This is good for Bitcoin.  If we can shift consensus within the global Bitcoin community to put pressure on our worlds polluters, we can change it.  The more we consume the more voice we have.  We can use that voice to expedite the shift from Coal to clean sources.  Consuming energy isn't a bad thing, dirty energy is.  Coal is close to half of our energy generation globally.

If you give someone Bitcoin and you get a house, how is that not buying a house with Bitcoin?  What they do with the Bitcoin after you give it to them has nothing to do with the fact that you exchanged Bitcoin for a house.

1) Not a law or regulation. 
    
2) This actually helps their case that they are backed given they are still in business a half a year later. 
   
3) Not a law or regulation.  If you want to talk business, then maybe you should look into why a business would not want to tell people where they are raising and storing their money.  Bitcoin is constantly under attack.

It is unreasonable to demand something you are not entitled to and attack them for not complying.

@_date: 2018-06-16 01:28:05
No.  Coinbase has a history of banning accounts who send\receive with gambling sites.  Coinbase has very good blockchain analytics and they will see you doing this and possibly ban your account.
  
You're going to want to break the trail of your coins.  Does the gambling site support other cryptos besides Bitcoin?  I just checked and they do not.  You're going to need to break the trail and that will cost you more money in fees.

History is not on your side because the price has increased with adoption.

In order to be in the hodl position, you had to acquire Bitcoin in the first place.  Whatever you did to acquire that bitcoin was not done sitting on your ass doing nothing.  It most likely came from hard work and on top of that hard work you risked some of your wage on this new thing called Bitcoin.  You took risks depending on how much you decided to hodl and that my friend, is not sitting on your ass.  That is the opposite of sitting on your ass.  The idea that hodlers think they will get rich sitting on their ass is a fallacy because you didn't become a hodler by sitting on your ass.
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:46:56
You have to compare apples to apples.  Today's latest GPU is not the same as last years latest GPU and manufacturing numbers are not the same either.  They are adjusted to meet demand when it is possible.  Your assertion was that demand lowers the price and that just isn't true as we saw last year with GPU prices.
   
You also said above that the price of mobile phones dropped with adoption and that is not true either.  If you compare certain models that have had a persistent production, then those may have fallen in price because the cost of fabrication has lowered over time.  But the cost of the best selling phone has gone up.  Meaning that the mobile phone in demand has done nothing but go up year over year.  Just go look at iPhone prices and what it cost for the latest iPhone for an example.
  
You're ignoring a lot of factors and the result is that you are wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:50:01


Can you cite where this is a law or regulation that they need to open their books to randos on reddit?
  
  Of course you can't, because it isn't a law, you're projecting your own feelings on the matter and making up rules that suit your bias.
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:47:39
I gave you an example earlier.  High end GPUs skyrocketed in 2017 because of demand.  
  
I'm paying more for the latest iPhone than I did 10 years ago.  I'm paying more for my "internet package" than I did 10 years ago.
  
It's not worth arguing with you at this point.  You've already proven you will pigeon hole an argument to fit your narrative like you're about to try doing with adoption by trying to tie it to merchants when it is much bigger than just merchants.

In a perfect world without corruption, this would be a reasonable expectation.  But you yourself admit that corruption is happening, that big forces are at play here.  So it is unreasonable to place this expectation on them.  There are all kinds of forces at work, ones that would destroy tether, ones that would co-opt tether, ones that would compete with tether.  They need to maintain an advantage and secrecy is a good tool for that.

Bcash is an altcoin and not suitable for discussion here.  That being said, why do you think it is a good choice?  You said it seems like a good choice.
  
Here's my top 3 reasons for choosing to hold Bitcoin instead of Bcash.  There are other projects that are innovating and moving the space forward that I own instead.
  
- It has a central leader(Roger Ver).  Bitcoin has no central leader.  
- It has very low development.  Bitcoin has an immense amount of development happening within core and around the project.  
- It is more centralized than Bitcoin and if people actually used it and blocks grew then it would become even more centralized.

I've never seen someone say this.  The opposite is true, I am constantly seeing people worry about it being hacked.  Go look up all the QC FUD that's been submitted here over the years.
    


   
This has nothing to do with the security of the coin and everything to do with the exchanges and 3rd parties.  Exchanges like MtGox are not Bitcoin.
   


    
This isn't true at all.  
  
At this point I decided to check your reddit history and saw that you say a lot of stupid shit.

It's not so much support for Tether as it is blowback for the years of Tether FUD.  There have been people hammering us with things like "Tether is not backed" for years with no proof.  Now we have some proof it is backed and people are coming out of the woodwork to talk it down.  It's almost like there is a coordinated campaign to tarnish Tether so people won't choose it when there is another option.

No it isn't.  This is news from this year and it is fake news because people propagating it are removing important words like "might" or "possibly" and instead saying the study found it definitely happened when the study says no such thing.
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:03:02
In what way does it provide a false sense of security?
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:56:42
"May have been" manipulated.  You either didn't read the paper or are working from a script.  The paper doesn't draw conclusions like you just did because it can't.  It doesn't have the data to do it.  So you're a liar when you word it the way you have.  Stop lying and manipulating. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:07:27
So only poor people use reddit?  You're going to disappoint your buttcoin friends with such failure.
  
I wasn't born rich and am unfamiliar with proper rich person etiquette.  I'm still waiting on my top hat and monocle because they're lost in the mail.

My point is that most traders aren't trading their life savings so sleeping isn't a problem.
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:50:22
There's really no point in debating with you since you are openly ignoring the fact that cryptocurrencies are a new and controversial area with little regulation.  There are no protections for a company like Tether.   So if someone with power wants to hurt them, all they need is knowledge of where to attack.  
  
I pointed out that there are reasons that have nothing to do with fraud to be private and you told me I didn't know what I was talking about.  That was your first sentence.  You're an idiot or a shill, but I think it is more likely you are a stupid statist here practicing confirmation bias to make yourself feel better.

I joined this club years ago and it is not that great of a club(so far).  There is no pool or tennis courts or bar.  You don't get to spend your bits or you are out of the club.  It's like a time share but less fun and more stressful.

You have a history of being a negative nancy.

The last BTC won't be mined for over a century unless we change something or there is an issue that results in blocks being found rapidly for an extended period of time.  In the end Bitcoin is code and we can change the incentive structure through code if there is a need and we can reach consensus.  Consensus being the hard part.  I won't speculate so far in the future.  We all know Bitcoin was designed so that fees would pay miners beyond the block reward but it's too far in the future to say that will be the case.

Meh.  Botnets can rules this metric whenever they want so take it with a grain of salt.

Sign up with an exchange like Coinbase and set an autobuy for $100 every 30 days.  You can totally avoid fees by making a non-market order on coinbase pro.
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:32:24
That's a complicated question because the cost of mining isn't evenly distributed so some miners make more than others.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:54:32
I disagree with your premise that Bitcoin is not yet a "real currency".  Bitcoin is a currency.
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:50:03
Retarded comment.  So I just have to express any commodity or fiat money in terms of its USD value and that makes it a pyramid scheme.  Got it. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:14:18
A few weeks ago you said we wouldn't see 6.5k again.  Fuck off.

You're confused.  Volume is not 100% correlated with new users.  The largest percentage of volume is traders and their bots auto-trading.  The decreased volume is traders adjusting to conditions and not a lack of new users.

McNuggets are a food pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:23:12


  
No it does not make it a pyramid scheme.  Bitcoin is a new asset class that can be used in many different ways.  It isn't only a currency, or only an investment vehicle or only a method to purchase things on DNMs.  It is all of those things and more.  You don't even appear to understand the definition of a pyramid scheme so just stop saying stupid shit.

Literally retarded.  There are other coins worth holding.
