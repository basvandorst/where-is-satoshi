You're always at a turning point when you're spiraling down the drain I guess.

Yeah.. The bitcoin response to the surprise should be: "What part of can't be killed didn't you understand?"

Were they even funded yet? Why was the original deleted?

Everyone that reviews the history will have a different opinion.  Some people would consider coins from a mixer to be grey, even if they weren't mixed with "darker" coins..
I don't even get what you're looking for by calling it a riddle. Are you looking for some clever catchy answer? Doesn't seem like the right setup for a catchy answer.

Not sure.. I've got a few.. but I was planning on holding onto them (but there's always a price, but I'm sure you could do better elsewhere)

OK, it looks to me to be more of a simple display problem.
I withdrew my .5 btc that I had there even though my account balance appeared to be 0.00.. I sent it over to blockchain with no problems.. 
For fun I tried to send about 10 more, but it failed saying I didn't have the funds.. 
I also tried .5 again and it also failed.. 
For peace of mind, I'd suggest you guys withdraw whatever balance you know you should have there at least until things are sorted out (maybe longer?).. and don't keep too much there as others have already suggested.

There is no evidence that I've ever heard of that the the guy that created the Casascius coins has been anything but completely on the up and up. I think if you had to trust someone he is an excellent choice. The thing is, that you don't have to trust him. You can get a two factor coin, and there's no need to trust him any farther than you can throw him.
From the beginning he's actually gone to great lengths to make sure that you can trust him. He's made his identity very public, and he's made it very clear that if anything ever disappeared from one of those coins, that he was the responsible party.  He's never entrusted any other party with the any information that could be abused. He's documented his procedures coin key generation, and published the source code of the program he used. He has published information about every coin he's ever created, and the balances.. and so on, and so on..
Two factor coins are just an extension of his desire for you to have a cool bitcoin product and not have to worry your pretty little head that someone could steal your money..
I have about 100BTC in coins from Casascius, and I've given some to other people as well.. I'm not worried at all about him stealing the balances because he secretly kept a copy of the private key. I don't think that anyone here is trying to say he's not trustworthy (correct me if I'm wrong)..

It should be noted: Look at the entire history of Bitcoin on a logarithmic scale. You can't tell much from the last two months.
Explicit instructions:
go to 
click on charts
click on time period and change it to all data
click on use log scale checkbox on the right
Notice that it's basically a straight line that's been pretty consistent. It  has a few bumps on top of it (periods of excess hype), but the bottom line is rock solid, and heading up exponentially (that's what a straight line on a log scale means). 
Continue to follow the line, and you'll notice that you hit some pretty absurd numbers pretty quickly.

Heads up guys.. It looks like they're standing by their story, and offering additional confirmations.  
Maybe we were all duped... by the person telling us we were all duped.
It looks like most information was probably correct coming from both sources.. It's true PBOC doesn't have an official statement, but people in the meeting(s) are supposedly confirming the ban also.

OK, this is off topic, but how exactly is the 27 hear old goat from spain that ships worldwide  going to be worth the effort (or the torture to the goat)

A valuable lesson, and what I'm going to call a bit of "quantitative mitigation" for the rest of us..
Edit: BTW, good luck with your recovery, 'cause we don't need your 1/1500000000th of a penny, and the bitconomy doesn't need to lose content :)..

Hehe.. I just went there yesterday when they were in UW.. That's as close as they come to where I work, so I'll probably drive down on Wednesday's on a fairly regular basis.. 
I didn't hear about the Paypal  part of the transaction.. I just know he hit a calculator to compute the btc, then hung out the ipad with the QR code.  The description makes it sound awkward, but it really wasn't.. They commented on how it's so much easier than taking credit cards for them.. and I'd have to agree from my perspective.. I had my wallet up and waiting to find a qr code so when they were ready it wasn't much different than paypass or something.. I just had to aim a little.
Agreed on the food. It's fantastic even if you don't have bitcoin to spend it's a great place to eat. I got the Voldemortadella (I think that's it's name) and a cup of soup and it came to 0.0562.. I guess the soup is a little more than the cookie.. 
They told me I was customer  paying in bitcoin. Did that end up making you  Supposedly one of their regulars was already into bitcoin (not the one that encouraged them into bitcoin) and was shocked to find out that they accepted it, but was thrilled to get to use it at a brick and mortar (rubber and steel?) location.

I'm 41, male, and a database/web developer. I went to college, but never quite finished a degree.
I'm also an early adopter that bought 1400 bitcoins for $19.50 way back in the day.  I still have right around 1/2 of them.. I'm in it for the long term, but I also believe they need to be used, not just held. 
That's been getting easier as the price has gone up. I don't get the economic theory that we'll never spend them because they're going up.. In my experience, and the experience of others that I've talked to, people spend bitcoin more when it goes up..
