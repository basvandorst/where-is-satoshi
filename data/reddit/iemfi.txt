The lesson we learn from that is that the law isn't the final say on morality. We can use our own moral systems to judge. And in this case many people find blasphemy moral but what gawker did immoral.

Both true. The price adjusts as futures start to be traded, but after that it should reduce volatility.

It's actually quite peculiar. Between holding bitcoin and betting on the numerous very optimistic bets on BitBet it seems that one can be almost guaranteed a rather large return on any bitcoin investment regardless of which way bitcoin goes. Strange that the efficient market hasn't taken care of that (I suppose the risk of bitbet running away with the money is a factor).

Silly question, what's the correct way to check each address? I used the code from the first thing I could find on github for C# and it's checking only a dozen or so per core per second. As far as I can tell there isn't much involved so how the hell am I orders of magnitude slower?

I don't think the website being down is much evidence of anything. I still think there's a close to 50% chance that mtgox is just really incompetent and they are not insolvent. Would bet on it more if I didn't already have so much on the line. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:44:26
Also if they did somehow get 750,000 bitcoins stolen wouldn't they IMMEDIATELY announce it to the whole world to shift the blame from themselves? It would be incredibly stupid of them to wait a few weeks before telling everyone while sitting around drinking Starbucks. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:24:07
Pretty happy, I sold a good part of my stash predicting that the price would tank once the mtgox lack of BTC withdrawals hit the news. At least it partially makes up for my coins stuck in mtgox.

That's madness, and the other people betting yes are probably even more insane. The 1k BTC guy presumably has tons to throw around and doesn't mind the bet even if it end's up -EV.
Assuming the No side goes up to 100BTC the no bet would still be worth it even if you were 90% sure bitcoin would win. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:56:50
I've posted before regarding the story about the guy who threw away his hard drive with bitcoins in it. Without any hard evidence all these stories have a very high prior of being fake. There are just too many people in the world who would make something like this up just for the sake of lying. Add the chance of fame/profit and it gets worse.

Actually if you believe that BS than it would be a good deal since it says they will not let gox fail but rebrand it instead. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:20:49
I would bet if I didn't have so god damn many coins stuck in there. I really don't understand why the market prices it so low though, it's not like cash is easy to get out and mtgox has been making press releases which IMO is a good sign. Also any incompetence shown is a good sign since the alternative is malice.

1. You end up with less, you lose a portion of your x BTC since it's now worth less, your y USD doesn't change.
2. What you're saying as I understand is, you start with 190x + 0y and end with 198x + 0y. Correct? Now you're saying this is a profit. 
I'm saying this is *not* a profit. At the start, x = 220y. At the end x = 100y. So even though you end up with more x, you end up with less y. 
3. Scenario A. Selling 90 BTC *is* a good action to take. But the bet is not a good action to take. A scenario C where you didn't take the bet but sold 90 BTC is superior. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 10:24:37
Ok, say I offered you a bet. You own 90 BTC. So I say, sell your 90 BTC now and give me the money from the sale. If the price of BTC goes down to 100, I will give you back 100 BTC. If the price of BTC goes up to 1000, I will give you back your 90 BTC. 
Would you take the bet (assuming the price won't stay between and I'm perfectly trustworthy)? Is this a win-win situation for you? 
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:22:22
Ok, last try, put it another way, go back to your previous post. In step 5 you replace your original 90 bitcoins worth 220 each with bitcoims worth 100 each. You can't do that! It doesn't balance
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:30:16
It is hard to visualize (thinking of how to explain it better made my head hurt), so here's a table instead:
|                         |    Start BTC |    Start $ (220 each)  |    BTC (with rebuy) |    Final $ (100 each)  |    Win BTC (with rebuy)|    Final $ (1000 each) |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
|    Bet Only             | 190          | 41800       | 90          | 9000       | 290        | 290000    |
|    Sell 90 BTC with bet |    190       | 41800       | 198         | 19800      | 219.8      | 219800    |
You cannot trick math!
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:10:42
If you lose the bet you end up with 8 BTC more but you don't *win* overall. You're out the $22000 you put into the bet! With your action to sell 90BTC you've gained $10800, but you still make a net loss of $11200. 
And shit like that is why gambling is difficult.
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:59:18
You're just screwing around with the payoff amounts (the same way gambling systems do), the expected value doesn't change. 
With the bet you would put in $22000 today, you stand to lose $22000 and stand to gain $178000.
By selling 90 BTC at $220 you stand to win $10800 and stand to lose $70200. You've effectively hedged your bet but it's by no means a "win-win" scenario.
@_date: 2015-01-31 11:35:28
If you sold 180 BTC and *didn't* take the bet you would end up with 396 BTC. If you took the bet and sold 180 BTC you wouldn't end up with 396, you would end up with 100 + 198 = 298 BTC. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:22:11
If you sold 180 BTC and didn't take the bet you would end up with 396 BTC. If you took the bet and sold 180 BTC you wouldn't end up with 396, you would end up with 100 + 198 = 298 BTC. You end up with 98 LESS BTC if you took the bet than if you didn't. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 11:14:30
But if you didn't take the bet and kept the money from the sale instead you will have 198 BTC instead of 100 when the price goes to 100. How is losing 100 BTC a win?
@_date: 2015-01-31 08:17:39
What? If you do nothing then obviously it is 0 all the way. If you mean do nothing except sell 90 BTC (ie start with 19800) then it would be:
 19800 | 19800 | 19800
You don't lose or profit from BTC price changes if you don't own any BTC. Sure, you could end up with more or less BTC but the actual value of the BTC *stays the same*. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 08:07:12
Pretend the price of bitcoin crashes completely and goes to $0.00001. Your decision to sell 90 bitcoins is now a very good one, you've made $1980 from that decision. You rebuy bitcoins and end up with a gazillion bitcoins. But have you made a million times profit? No, you made $1980 profit. What about the bet? You've still lost $0.00001 * 100 to the bet. 
That's assuming like you said, you don't buy the bitcoins to pay the bet until after the bet. It's a strange way to calculate things, but the math still comes up the same. You still lose $10000 if it goes to $100, you have to buy 100 BTC at 100 each to pay the guy. You can choose to use the $9800 to "buy back" your original 90 btc but that doesn't change anything!
|                         |    Start BTC |    Start $ (220 each)  |    BTC (with rebuy) |    Final $ (100 each)  |    Win BTC (with rebuy)|    Final $ (1000 each) |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
|    Bet Only             | 0          | 0       | 0          | -10000       | 0        | 100000    |
|    Sell 90 BTC with bet |    0       | 19800       | 0         | 9800      | 0      | 119800    |
Lots of people fall for these sort of gambling systems. People don't get that you can't modify another bet by hedging, hedging just transfers the risk around. You can't make a win-win situations with multiple -EV bets.

That's all I've been doing. And yoyu just changed the topic from my previous post. Ignore the $1000 side of the bet please, it's neutral. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 10:01:22
Ok good, at least we're getting somewhere. 




This is the crux of it. If you have 300 BTC and the price of BTC goes down you still have 300 BTC. But the value of that 300 BTC is now less. You have made a loss. Do you disagree with this? 
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:31:49
That's silly though, it makes no sense to pay people now based on some expected future value of bitcoin. Easier to just buy the bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:47:41
The point is they're separate bets. One is on what percentage of the mt gox coins/cash gets returned and another whether bitcoin will go up to $3000. If the first bet is not profitable then it makes no sense to buy in on this. Much better to just buy some coins and wait for them to go to $3000.
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:42:41
Please read my table carefully, it took some googling to copy from excel. You start with 190 BTC ($41800), you sell 90 and put the other 100 into the pot (you are not holding this 100, it's stuck in the pot!). If it goes down to $100 you rebuy 198 BTC, you now have $19800 worth of BTC, *you lose $11200*.
Please stop trying to fight math.  
@_date: 2015-01-31 08:29:19
No, because I'm using your strange method which started and ended with 0 BTC. Except in your method when you rebuy the BTC you conveniently forget that the BTCs are not worth the same anymore while in my graph you rebuy the 90 BTC but that doesn't change the fact that you end at $9800 worth of BTC and money and started with $19800 of BTC and money.
@_date: 2015-01-31 11:41:04
Yes it would be, and the bet is very skewed one way, I stand to win if BTC goes to 100 but I stand to lose a lot more if BTC goes to 1000. I wouldn't take the bet unless I was almost certain that BTC wasn't going to go to 1000. But that's besides the point, the point is that it's not a win-win.

@_date: 2013-11-11 13:56:11
No the risk would be code inserted by a rogue developer as part of a routine update. Code which looks harmless enough that the other developers would not notice. For example in the link to the wiki article on the underhand competition. For 2007 it was "encrypt and decrypt files with a strong, readily available encryption algorithm such that a low percentage (1% - 0.01%) of the encrypted files may be cracked in a reasonably short time.".
