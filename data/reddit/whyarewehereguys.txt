Bch and btc are at war and bch is currently winning, bitcoin has been dead for like the last week. While eth and Itc and taking advantage.

I just cash out at 1millie

Go to eth, all this fighting between bcash and bitcoin isn't going away for awhile, it's all very immature. As these two camps fight ethereum will take  spot.

It's really not that interesting. It's a new account, daa daaaaa.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:02:46
Ah, the good ol' days.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:31:41
It's only 7 years old, bitcoin is still a small child.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:43:18
But overall this year if you invested in eth you would've made 2000% more than if you invested in btc.a
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:58:39
Eth has had a 3000% increase this year, the numbers speak for themselves. You're all busy fighting while the BIG money is entering ethereum.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:27:00
Nope, I can just read the charts.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:03:08
Think I was right guys.
