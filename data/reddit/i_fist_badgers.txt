There should be another subreddit for BTC memes. A lot of subreddits do this, and it's a good idea. I like the odd meme, the "Hold spartans" got a chuckle out of me, but other than that they're quite annoying on this subreddit.
Another poster said that they do not come to Reddit for serious discussion. Well guess what? Some do. And when people refer interested newbies to it makes the system look like a joke when it's just stupid memes everywhere.

About 300mh/s with a 7850 at 1050mhz (maximum OC ATi CCC will allow). Gonna spend a day getting the maximum clock possible with trixx or something and see where we go from there. Not just for BTC mining, I enjoy OC'ing and pushing my hardware.

Holy crap. For all the posts that have been complaining about this subreddit, there's the people like you who make sure I don't unsubscribe. Not because I want tips, hell I don't even post that much, but just because it's nice to be in the company of amazing individuals like yourself.

The fiat currency drug trade is infinitely larger than SR. The problem is, I think SR is the main thing people think of or hear of when hearing about BTC. We need lots of smaller retailers to drown out SR to a certain extent - I think bitcoin will always be associated with SR to a certain extent, but more smaller retailers will remove some of the stigma, and hopefully convince larger retailers to accept BTC.

[BitBargain]( is absolutely dead easy. You pay a little more than the going rate, but I guess that covers transaction fees and what not.
See who's online, do you like their prices? Yeah? Buy now, choose amount, transfer money to that bank with reference and account details, you get btc in your BitBargain wallet, then you transfer to your offline wallet.

Yeah. I came to this subreddit today to get the general gist of what was going on. Instead I saw the price of BTC over and over and over again, when I already KNEW what it was, and was coming here to find out WHY that was.
Perhaps we need a new rule of what kind of increments/decrements can be posted about, and hint: It's not every $5.

Really? I bought 4 earlier, easiest thing I've ever bought. I used bitbargain.co.uk.
Just signed up, searched for buyers who I could buy 4BTC from, said I wanted to buy, transferred money from my bank account, and then transferred the BTC from the website wallet into mine.
