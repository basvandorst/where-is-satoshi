I love that communists is coming back as a slander. I genuinely chuckle every time I read it.

I don’t hold BTC so... enjoy those weak gains.

I think we could see sub 12k. Maybe even sub 10k. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:56:27
My concerns are with Bcash. Did you read my original response where I said that? I hold BTC and sell BTC like other coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:22:54
I would have bought some BCash a while back if it weren’t for him. He is so off putting and it keeps me away. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:35:14
I’m not just holding my coins hoping they are worth more later, no. I believe in the technology and the future of digital currency. Price going up is great but certainly not the end all be all. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:48
I think people need to remember why they are here. If it’s for a quick buck then you’re gonna have a bad time. If it’s because you believe in the technology and focus on the future, it’s all worth it. 
But I also didn’t take out loans to buy like some people...
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:28:13
But will it blend?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:48:17
This is true for anyone with money. Kidnappers demanding being paid in bitcoin is not the point. 
Edit: also that was two years ago. Also that was not in the US. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:50:21
Bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:55:29
Here in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:54:37
Chinese trying to grow BCH and hurt BTC? Pissed 2x got cancelled? I don’t know. Pure speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:44:38
This is pointless. Peace!
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:01:35
Hard to believe in the short term. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:53:03
It’s cold in Cumming tonight.

You can signup with another exchange? Kraken? Use a BTC ATM? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:16:59
Use NiceHash. Not mining bitcoin but paid out in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:42:27
Buy more coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:18:08
Can you share a how-to? I have a PI sitting next to me right now doing NOTTA.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:06:34
Ask and find out?
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:01:50
I too am an ATM operator. Already started my upgrades but I need my ISO to support...
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:22:02
Moved my two S9s to Slush earlier today. Gonna leave for a few days or till things shore up. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:46:58
Where can we see it happen? I switched both my S9s to slush in hopes to help even a little.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:45:30
Bought a bunch at $6100. Feel ok about it. Long!
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:41:44
This is great. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:10:36
It’s risen like crazy this year. Exploded even. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:02:14
That’s assuming ISOs will support it. It’s not as easy as just turning it on. I know because I just updated a few ATMs to this software. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:40:15
Amen. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:55:49
Get his to the top!
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:38:21
Is there a how-to anywhere?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:55:16
You get rich. You get rich now friend. Get rich friend. We do. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:52:44
Buy and hold. Ride the waves. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:25:33
Bingo. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:35:07
Not really. ATMs are not setup to input money. They are only used to dispense money.  98% of transactions on BTC ATMs are buying. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:08:40
Can you share an example of someone getting kidnapped seeing as how that was what I was commenting about? I realize people get robbed everyday. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:40:47
Why do you think they have it all on their phone? Where does he say or insinuate that? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:33:19
Was his laptop not password protected? Why did they hack his social media? There are so many questions here...
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:56:02
So true. I am sure he carries at LEAST $1,000,000 in cash at all times. I would if I could.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:10:01
Yeah of course. My thoughts exactly. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:08:36
The whole premise that he would be kidnapped is laughable. For all we know he cashed of all his bitcoin and is just rich now. Lots of rich people in the world. LOTS 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:59:59
Can you post an example of all those things you posted happening in the United States? I’m gonna have to tell all my rich friends about these obviously extreme dangers. I mean, at least 20 of my friends are worth over 10 million and most don’t even carry a gun. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:56:35
Kidnappers? What country do you live in?
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:25:40
Contact info? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:36:22
Where did you find a Bitcoin ATM for sale?
