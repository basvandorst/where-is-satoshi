Yes. Most wealth in the world is in dollars and people rush into dollars in financial crises, like the one that is coming. The asset bubble that exists now is going to pop meaning when all these overvalued companies get their worth cut in half, tons of dollars will disappear. This is short-med term deflationary and bullish for dollars.

It's not guaranteed to increase and people spend at the expense of the future all the time. Every time you buy fast food, luxury goods, etc you're wasting money you could put into capital. When people buy technology knowing it will be better and cheaper in a few years they do this as well.

This. Cryptography and Blockchain will have increasingly important applications but the earliest iterations of digital currency are unlikely to continue to be the dominant ones.

With Bitcoin you are the only person who owns those coins. With fiat currency there can be a bank run and "your" money literally disappears. 
I bought highish and it was at a really bad time for me and my family to do so, so I've lost money on this, but I knew the risks getting into it.

You're not investing in the man you're investing in the company, one which is valued 500k for every car they produce at a loss annually (with huge subsidies). This company is also in debt and pays no dividends, and debt is only going to get more expensive after the December rate hike.

Musk isn't going far imo. Deeply indebted with no earnings and interest rates rising make that debt more expensive.
