Just casually connecting a negative event (hurricane, personal loss of btc) with a presidency :)

Not blaming your lack of knowledge, but those who call around to find a miner that was not lucky for some while.... Anyway, what they told you and what actually happened might also be two different things :)

Just pointed out some technical inaccuracies in your fiction :)

Bought my first coins of gox, took ages to wire money to japan. And bitcoin rose +50% while I was waiting. Were still a good deal in hindsight :D

This is a bit weird, as it does not matter how long you did not find a block. Likelihood of finding one withing the next X minutes is always the same. This piece makes the story look strange.
Usually miners mine, and sell (partially?) what they mined before.

The issue is with the fiat-bridge... In BTC it is already solved by BTCPay.

oh wow, i consider that good news. it passed by rather unnoticed here. thanks for the link!

So.... Any news on the bounty? Last time wasabi applied for it, the key holders of the escrow wallet seemed to be rather quiet....

As I understand it, it is not his money - he collected to it support scaling solutions.

Who are you to decide which space on the blockchain is necessary and which isn't?
It's the economic force that should drive users to services that use modern tech to minimize costs and maximize their profit.

Thanks for the insight. So the fuse somehow detects when the CPU is removed? There is usually no power on a Trezor...

The seed is in my wifes bank vault.
The passphrases reside with my direct relatives, multiple copies. 
For daily usage I remember the passphrase and the pin on my hw wallet, which is at home and in a different country at a trusted person (has neither PIN nor passphrase)
If I die unexpectedly they would have to figure this out by them self, but some others in family know their way around bitcoin, so it's gonna be easy.

All the parts being on one chip, so on powering the bootloader gets executed etc makes perfect sense. Sounds non trivial to extract the seed.... Somehow I was bound to the classical PC concept... RAM/HDD/CPU.....
Thanks
