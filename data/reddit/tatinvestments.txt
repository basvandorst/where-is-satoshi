Good call.

I think you have it backwards.

Hey, you an still point them at  (Altcoin)!

Boo hoo, I have to pay for services! 
What an inconvenient convenience!
Also, this is actually a good thing for bitcoin.

"If the Bitcoin movement actually requires enormous sacrifice, of the devastating variety no less, merely for the future benefit of humanity, one may counter that the ongoing minor tragedy of one's annual tax bill seems like far less of a sacrifice. This is also a sacrifice that many times accrues to the benefit of others. What's the difference?"
No sacrifice is required, but some sacrifice is inevitable. We have discovered fire. Some are so cautious they won't get close, some are so naive they are burning themselves. 
What's the difference? The difference is that the government is not suited to all tasks. The difference is that institutionalized loss and waste throttles progress unnecessarily. The pain of loss can't be mitigated in a way that makes it disappear, to believe such is to choose ignorance over healing.

Well when someone sets up an obvious pump thread, you can't complain when obvious FUDsters come around.

You realize he could lose, right?

Wow, you sure use a lot of words to say nothing at all.
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:00:52
So he wants to make ZERO CONFIRMATION spends harder to do, by making a really great way to double spend. Y'know, cuz fuck confirmations, fuck the system that already exists to prevent double spends, put more system in dat system! Let honesty prevail!
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:42:12
No. Because you'd then have to deal with chargebacks.

"In exchange, market operators get the benefit of the doubt from most consumers as a result of regulation"  
Do you not see the problem with this? Do you not see how this is allowing much more gross crime on the people?

I take issue with this comment "it seems that the majority of Bitcoiners did not sufficiently understand or know the risks of doing business with Mt. Gox."  
Do you have any evidence to support that?

Get out while you can, before you lose more!

Listen up folks. It's not often someone who has their head on straight takes the time to perform a public service and write out what's wrong with the latest hypestorm. 
The op is right, and the people who know what's up have been singing this same tune for a while. 
Etherium comes to you from one of the same guys that tried get investors to put money into a "quantum miner"...

This is only true if your system lacks a seasoned web of trust. See here (and consider a world where there is decades-old ledger like this, tempered into usefulness): 
This is a much better way to assign trust via your circles, rather than trust via the media, oppression, or salesmanship.

"When it comes to money, consumers need protection. Consumers are not sophisticated enough to assess the strength of balance sheets or the veracity of representations made by financial operators. As a result, modern societies have developed regulatory safeguards around financial services. How many people lost money with bank deposits during the financial crisis? Zero."
Just because the loss was obfuscated, does not make it Zero. Nothing is free, that is the whole misconception here, that somehow mistakes can be made to not have consequence, that somehow trusting the wrong party is something a government can insure against. It can't, it can only redistribute those mistakes to those who didn't make them.
You don't tell a child he must wear diapers his entire life because he is not sophisticated enough. You teach him not to need them at all.

How about you rebut my criticisms then? Bitcoin already has a system for this. They don't call them confirmations for nothing. Why do you want to make a meta system to enact arbitrary judgments of "honesty"? 
Your answer to preventing double spends is to create a really great way to double spend? What if this is compromised somehow? Basically a radar detector detector or someshit?

Is there a spreadsheet you can direct me to that lists what personal items I need to smash in order to get my way in various situations? 
For example: 
What do I smash to get out of cleaning my room ? 
What do I smash when I wreck my car (by mistake) ?
Most importantly, What personal item do I smash when smashing personal items doesn't work ?

The way it actually unfolds is that BitBet doesn't want late bettors gaming the system, so if you want your bet to make it "in time", of course you would include a tx fee. 
You'd also not bet in the last few hours of eligibility...

First thing to keep in mind is that Bitcoin is inflationary until it becomes deflationary, many years from now.

This is likely true. If you read his most recent letter to shareholders, you will note him hoisting virtues that are in direct opposition of some of the stances he is most famous for. He commends his likely successor's desire to invest in as many companies as possible, for example.

Your Gox and Poker examples are not systematic problems, they are user problems. We live in a world increasingly without appropriate consequence. Bitcoin can correct this. It can wake people up to how trust should properly be bestowed.

1) I made a very similar point. The video is not meant for that target audience. It will first be used to promote to business professionals at expos and conferences, and used for online education/promo. Other marketing local to Cyprus will be done that suits other target audiences.
2) My guess is that it was done this way to the Neo promo parts could be cut off and make the video all-purpose for outreach/education.
