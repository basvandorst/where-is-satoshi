Property in London increased 83% since the last crash in 2008. Crypto did pretty well too. Hard assets like crashes when quantitive easing is a policy. Crypto will do just fine in the next crash, so will property as long as they don’t get taxed too much.

That’s only on profit as well

@_date: 2019-03-13 00:05:02
Not true if you consider tax 
@_date: 2019-03-13 07:10:54
Many countries have crypto taxes. What tax? Lol.

I know a guy that works for to stop cyber financial fraud and he says they can stop crypto accounts pretty easily when they want to these days but he’s still bullish on crypto long term.

Join the a banano discord, they would love a virtual reality faucet and are giving away a lot of the fastest and free DAG type crypto coins at the moment. Try the banano Reddit first maybe.

He leaked details of individuals and their family homes and generally  put at risk many many people. He didn’t edit his leaks to protect individuals. He mass leaked. Very poor journalism. Unethical.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:55:56
Journalists are supposed to protect innocent parties. He broke the first rule, cause no harm.

Wait till the next bull run happens, you won’t be able to work
@_date: 2019-04-11 05:56:37
I’m friend with a serious fraud prevention computer scientist, he says even bit coin is recoverable these days. There are ways.
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:01:30
‘Journalists should 'do no harm' Primum non nocere, or “first, do no harm” in English, is a Latin term most closely associated with doctors. However, this basic principle doesn't just apply to the medical world–-it also applies to the world of media and journalism’
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:45:13
He was stupid to print without editing
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:47:29
Two wrongs don’t make a right. He did some good things, wiki leaks has generally been a force for good I would argue but he also put at risk people though his poor practice of not editing. The moment as a journalist you put at risk small children, you lose your saint status.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:40:44
He called a bit coin a ‘buy’ at top levels in January, anyone who did would be screwed right now. He doesn’t always get it right. He also did the same for silver and it never recovered.

You can earn banano using your computer  to support medical research then sell the banano for BTC. Once distribution is done in about four years, you might do quite well if you hold your bans. He upcoming V20 update will make transfer rate 1 second and free.
@_date: 2019-05-28 21:44:53
That’s why crypto won’t beaten easily  but exactly which  coin and /or platform. will be more useful ... well, like Netscape, that will change.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:20:03
It’s just binance buying 7000 BTC to pay back

Is it ever a good idea to say loudly that  ‘I have a code which can release possible large amounts money’?

From looking at those  graphs it looks like  we will have a pretty big drop quite soon
