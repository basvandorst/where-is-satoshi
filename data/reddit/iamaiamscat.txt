It's a good thing there is plenty of liquidity in the futures market.  You seem to be implying you can't buy it back? as if there's no liquidity.. the market would be dead- it's certainly not.


So what? Futures are marked-to-market every single trading day.  You act like "forced to settle up" means something here.
The ONLY advantage of waiting until expiration would be if you wanted to avoid paying commissions to flatten your position. But by doing that, you have no control over what the final price is.
I have 13 years of professionally trading futures contracts, so I know how they work.  This thread is absolute nonsense.  No one who trades futures speculatively gives a crap about the settlement date except to make sure you roll your damn position on time.

Then why do you give a shit about bitcoin itself and not jump to a coin that can actually handle large volume?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:54:20
Err, so what?
To "cash out" a short futures position at any time you just buy the contracts back to net your short to flat...

What do you think "non-public" means?
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:16:33


Insider trading is defined as acting on material non-public information.

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:02
There's shit volume in the futures market, that doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:41:33
My god, most of you people have no basis economics understand.  That's fine, most people didn't study it.  But stop pretending you have a damn clue.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:18:02


Yeah I always wanted a slow fee-high way to buy something that I can't actually use to buy stuff anywhere because it's volatile as shit and even if they do accept it you need to tack on 10% of the price to handle the price swings.
Why isn't everyone using it!?
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:09:06


Simple- when anyone reasonably has access to that information.  Does "the public" have reasonable access to the information in your examples? No.  But of course insider trading is only in the context of trading on a public exchange.


If you are trading on a public exchange, then yes it is.


Let's replace diamond with gold, because gold has a public trading exchange (i.e., you can trade gold futures contracts).  Otherwise "insider trading" doesn't exist at all, so we have to be talking about a public exchange here.
If you discover an enormous amount of gold- something that would have a *material* price impact in the market.. if this is not public information, and you start shorting the futures market and then release this information about your super large gold cache discovered.. **That is insider trading.**

This is what I find amusing about Bitcoin.  Why in the world are you quoting things in fixed dollars, with a floating BTC amount?
If you thought BTC had any real value then you would have said "0.01 BTC".  But nope.. it seems like it's always quoted in the dollar equivalent.
Hmm.. how curious...
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:43:11
Good thing you did that, I'm not sure how anyone could have envisioned a checkbox and a place to put the bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:28:08
Screw that.  You honestly think most people want to pay for every web page they load up?
I don't give a shit about ads compared to paying to read every random article.
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:56:02
You don't seem to understand:
I don't care that much about ads on the page.  *I do care about having to pay for every page I view.*
You want to microtransaction the fuck out of the internet.  Someone should punch you in the face for even trying to introduce that idea.
You think ads are intrusive?  How about "CLICK HERE TO READ THE NEWS ONLY 0.01920189012 bitcoins!!!" No wait, "CLICK HERE TO READ THE NEWS ONLY 0.01920189011 BITCOINS!!!!!!! PENIS!"

So, you all realize that the only reason they are accepting bitcoin is they will be charging a large enough spread so they could right away turn around and go to anyone and exchange those bitcoins back for $ at a higher value.
You will end up paying MORE for an item with bitcoins than you would if you had dollars.  Guaranteed.
This is no different than if they offered to accept Euros.  They are only going to accept Euros if they are virtually guaranteed they can exchange those Euros into USD immediately and be the same/better off.

Then show proof and tell someone about it.  Otherwise you are just talking out of your ass.
Could they be *inadvertently* money laundering?  Sure.  Infact most probably are and don't know about it.  You saying "I know" is the equivalent of making an educated guess that people get away with undetected money laundering.
In short, your argument has no basis in reality.

If crypto can be so easily manipulated as you suggest, then where is the value in it?
@_date: 2019-02-04 22:10:12


So according to you crypto*currencies* are here just to "get rich"... yeah that makes a lot of sense.
Come back to me when you find a use for it other than gambling!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:19


Uh sure but it's slow and (virtually) no one uses it for that... plus the price is so f'n volatile who would actually use it to buy or sell goods?  You are going to pay a HUGE premium to even try to use it.
For example: the price is sometimes moving +/- 20% in a day.  What does that mean?  If I'm a business like Amazon, and someone wants to pay with Bitcoin.. what has to happen?  Well.. ok let's say the current price of 1 BTC is $10k and the product you are buying is $10k.
You go to amazon checkout, how many BTC are they going to ask you to pay to buy this $10k product?  1 BTC? Hell no.  They will charge you something like 1.2 BTC.  This is because they need to hedge themselves against the volatile market.  So that at the end of the day when they get their bitcoins and need to convert it to dollars to cover themselves, they will have some assurance that they aren't taking on huge risks.
This is exactly why banks charge 1-2% or more for currency conversions.  Have some USD you want to send to someone in EUR?  You are going to pay 1-2% (or more) premium, because they don't know what the EUR/USD exchange rate will be at the end of the day.  But they know the volatility of the market, so come up with a reasonable figure.
Point being- BTC price is so volatile, transactions are not instant by any means- good luck with it ever becoming something that isn't just gambling like it is now.  Because that's what 99.999% of you are doing- gambling.  That's fine, but don't pretend like you are investing or going to use it for purchases.

Except the government could in theory reintroduce that $1 coin into the money supply.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:18:05
You are really trying to convince yourself of that, aren't you?
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:48:51
Wow.. you are trying SO HARD.
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:42:08


DING DING DING we have a winner!!


In its current state? Not much.  Especially bitcoin itself.  High transaction fees, slow processing.. yay!! At least other coins are solving some of these issues.  Bitcoin is a dinosaur, if it wasn't first it would be last now.
Blockchain is a very cool technology.  And yeah it has some value as it's a unique asset. But until it has A USE it's value is very small.
The only reason all these coins have a high relative value right now is people gambling.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:08:52
Unfortunately, it's not.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:30:57
How stupid can you be?
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:24:37
Lol.  Ok ok ok.. so, let's assume it is "market manipulation" like you said.
You have just proved that this wonderful massive energy-consuming global endeavor can be manipulated just like any other market, even with open ledgers? And even worse.. you can't punish the market manipulators because this isn't a regulated exchange..
Well, you sure just proved bitcoins worth.. it can easily be manipulated without consequences!  Wonderful.  To the moon in no time...
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:38:31
Gold is real and has uses......
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:13:37
Sure, I mean, he had $500, but then after conversion fees he's got like $450 equiv of bitcoin.. then by tomorrow when he tries to buy something with actual BTC the seller will tack on a 10% fee so they can cover price movements during the day.. by the time all that is said and done, he bought something for $500 which could have been done with 1 click on amazon with a credit card/bank for $400.
Yeah, way to go Bitcoin!!!!!!!!!!

Actually the only thing I've seen on this forum that makes sense.
Dollar cost averaging is just a concept that makes you feel better about holding onto a losing position.  Or, if you have a very specific objective to try over a long time to get into a big position around a certain price average.  Which doesn't make any sense with BTC because the value is completely arbitrary.. it's not like you are doing a DCF on Intel and saying "well, I think it's really worth $40/share from my calculations, so I want to try and buy at an average of $37 over time".
If you *want* to hold BTC for the long long term, then buy whenever you think it's hit a descent low point.  It doesn't matter what your current average cost into BTC is... that's a SUNK COST. IT DOESN'T MATTER. 
It only matters where the market is NOW and if you want to hold something or not at the current price.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:22:46


Dude you are an idiot.  So what that it's over 10,000% since it started?  You apparently don't know how percentages work.
Ok so I invest $1 on day 1 and it's up 10,000%.  Now I have $101, great.
Now it drops 50%.  I just lost $50.5
(10,000%) * (50%) means you just lost 5,000%, even though it "only" dropped 50%.

The lower the price gets the dumber you hodlers get.
