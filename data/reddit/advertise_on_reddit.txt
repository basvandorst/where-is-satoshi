Went from a lambo to a jet ski. Tomorrow back up to a house.

OK cool

Yes I'd spend probably 25% here and then open a chain of subways or something. After 5 years reevaluate. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:27
Hard to argue against this excellent point. 
But, was 8 years enough time?

He's implying your a damned commie. Now get in there and put a McDonald's on every street corner

How you feeling today, bro? Well done. Next up is 20k. See you there.

If you have debt, you should be buying crypto. Trading hours of your life for wages is precisely the same as slavery.

All that money could bleed into ripple when the herd realises that xrp isn't vaporware, promises, and is executing a real world solution, compared to BTC which is still speculative. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:13:45
This is all actually true and extremely interesting perspective.

I don't mean to be rude but are you new here? This question has been asked and answered for 7 years. 
And I mean are you new to the Internet in general? I'd like to introduce you to some modern tech you've been missing out on, in no particular order:

As a top 3 coin I guess it could or couldn't be.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:13
Human nature. Only partially mature technology. Early in adoption. Still in development. 
I know I said bit coin is speculative, and here is why. 
I'd still hold some.

There's your problem right there dude. You gotta do things on your own. 
You could have Google that answer for years, instead you let the best bet in history rise in value right past you. 
Are you even competent enough to be investing, after implying you aren't competent enough to look something up? 
Not trying to be rude, but why are you so helpless you have to ask for a link to bitcoin website on reddit? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:20:13
Tell people how they can tell. Is there a service running in task manager for example that I can identify?
Help us help you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:31:14
I are here as well. Unless another coin usurps this opportunity in the very near future. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:04:35
Hilarious.

Okay think of it like this first off less than a tenth of 1% of people are using Bitcoin at all and they have portions of their portfolio in Bitcoin and are only representing Lino 100 or $1,000 percent of the global transactions that happen everyday now imagine all of a sudden that hundreds of millions of people start joining everyday adopting something like 50% of global population so that billions of people become using Bitcoin over the course of some. Of time the same way that we use Visa or or debit cards or Mastercard or whatever once that happens you'll see not just the increasing effect of that compounded cash investment to the same Supply creating a bottleneck in an increase in demand versus Supply always raises the price but you'll see a exponential growth from the investors who were already there moving to make larger and larger positions as they do things like sell stock or sell shares or what-have-you you know like sell gold and start buying Bitcoin eventually bitcointalk to be worth somewhere between 400000 and 500000 / Satoshi figure Global transactions right now or around 40 quadrillion $ or something annually
