Is one better than the other?

That's my issue with Coinbase --- I have a Discover, and I don't want to wait a week for my BTC. I really need to place an ad on Backpage tomorrow and work this week in order to survive, and now that they only take Bitcoin, I've spent literally five hours trying to buy some to no avail. :(

Well, I just tired to buy via Coinbase, and it said the BTC wouldn't come until Friday! FRIDAY! I need it today.

I used Electrum, because I read about it on here.

Not without screening them first....

ChangeTip isn't working for me. I hit the buy button and nothing happens! I've tried it on both Chrome and Firefox to no avail. :(

Yeah, it said that apparently it was going to take 3 to 5 days with my banking account, so that's really no the best option for me.

They're all one and half to two hours away from me, though. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:56:34
Yeah, it didn't seem really well reviewed anywhere I looked up.

I've signed up for Circle, and it's taking a while to verify. I tried signing up for Coinbase, but they won't send it until Friday if I buy, and that's a week that I just can't afford to wait. I tried ChangeTip on both Chrome and Firefox, but the buy button won't do anything and I have no clue why. That offer is amazingly sweet, but I usually try not to take handouts.... but desperate times.... If you're really willing to send me some. I would be forever grateful, to be honest.  
Edit: And of course I'll be able to PayPal some money in exchange if you need me to!

I downloaded one of those wallets things... is that what you mean by controlling it myself? So if buy on Coinbase how long would it take to get? And if I buy a LocalBitcoin, would that mean that I'd have to meet someone somewhere? Because that sounds terrifying.

What is 2FA though?
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:49:58
The closest person near me is an hour and a half away....

I can use this to buy it using a credit card? OhmyGod, you might just be my savior. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:40:01
The only credit card I have is Discover. I have a Visa, but it's a debit, so that doesn't work.

I'm still kind of confused by the wallet, though, because of all the tabs, but I'm sure I'll learn it eventually.... I'm so confused about all of this stuff, but I'm thankful I found this community on here. You guys are really helping me shift though information and learn just what BTC is. Thank you!
