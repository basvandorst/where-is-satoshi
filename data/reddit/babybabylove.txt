Guys. Click on the link many times so that the scammer need to pay money to Google for Ads.

Thanks I will. Still waiting for reply. Freezing is ok. As long as people can't take the machine home, hack the android inside. Get all the money in bitstamp.

Like you I never kept anything there. I put BTC in because I didn't realise trading was halted.

I have a question for the Lamassu ATM. It is said that one cannot leave it unattended. Is this entirely true ? Can one leave it in a shopping mall and collect money out at the end of the day ? Or maybe poweroff it. Take out the ipad inside during the night and plug it back in the morning ?
Please let me know because I am seriously considering thanks.

Like I said, I submitted multiple tickets but no response.

Website like this should put a big disclaimer telling people which exchange  will steal your money. I am so glad mtgox volume is 8th in the world and hopefully going out of business soon.
