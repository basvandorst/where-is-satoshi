Your mistake was using Bitcoin. It has serious problems with fees. Try NEM for cheaper and faster transactions. Or IOTA if you're a brain surgeon capable of traveling through time.

Wow, can people in America just relax? Sweden has had these new tax rules all the time. Yes they're stupid but no need to panic

Interesting, I like the idea but this demands that the altcoins have similar properties as bitcoin. This would essentially mean that the different altcoins are like different denominations of bitcoins.

The convenience of being able to avoid cash money is far greater than the freedom of being able to trade anonymously. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of cryptocurrencies but you're comparing Apple's with oranges when bringing up your argument of banks wanting to get rid of cash. Cash is an old and outdated payment solution. As long as cryptocurrencies aren't available as a payment method in our daily life shopping, the current debit card solution works great.

I suggest you purchase a Trezor hardware wallet. You eliminate the third party risk by using it. Bittrex is a large exchange and I assume they won't cease your money without a valid reason. I guess they froze your assets because they didn't have enough information about you, ie KYC (know your customer). Bittrex have to comply with very strict laws about KYC, which means that if you have an outdated KYC document, for example a two year old bank statement, they might want you to get a new one before you get your money back. Good luck and don't worry

Inflation is not bad. Since it's practically impossible to lower an employee's salary in most countries, the employer can indirectly do that by raising less than the rate of inflation. Also, the inflation affects our spending habits, which can be controlled by controlling the central bank rates. This is just a few reasons why inflation is good.

Employers. It's hard to lower an employee's salary, but if you instead don't raise the their salary in the same pace as the inflation rate, the employee's real salary will decrease

Japan has been fighting against deflation for long periods of time. In times of deflation people tend to postpone their spending because they know that the good you are about to buy today will cost less tomorrow. This inhibits the growth of economies. Cryptocurrencies experienced the same phenomenon this fall; people weren't too keen on spending their Bitcoins because they thought Bitcoins would be worth more the next day. How does that help the Bitcoin society?

Dagens industri is a national finance newspaper. It is read by many in the financial market and is regarded as  legitimate. This is the first time I see an advertisement of this kind in Sweden and I love it. It reaches a different kind of reader than the average Bitcoin user. Hope to see more of these ads in the future

Finansliv is a paper that Sweden's largest union for people working in finance Finansförbundet publishes monthly. This was their cover page this month. They published a 4 page article explaining what cryptocurrencies and blockchain is used for and what it can achieve.

Forgot to translate the text. It says "the obvious choice when buying Bitcoins". It's an ad for a a Swedish market place
