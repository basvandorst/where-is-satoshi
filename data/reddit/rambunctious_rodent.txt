Thanks man. And good luck!

You and me both! Some slightly worrying comments further down this thread :(
Could I ask a random favour a stranger? Can you reply to this comment when your hard-earned eventually does hit your account? The reassurance would be muchos appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:38:36
Cool. Feeling reassured now. Thanks for that :)

Wow that’s quick. Out of interest, was that your first withdrawal? Or have you done it before? From doing some digging it looks as though they make people jump through a few extra hoops (“Know Your Customer” stuff) with a first withdrawals that won’t happen the second and subsequent times. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:35:15
Ok, now you’re just being pedantic. What is it about the internet that makes people fecking double down instead of admitting they might be wrong? Let’s agree that very large sums of money are often transferred electronically without the need to be broken down into installments and end this discussion here...
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:08:52
In case you haven done so already, worth having a word with whichever bank the money is due to land in. Always good to give a heads up re a very large transfer like this in case it triggers some sort of money-laundering red flag. I’m no expert but guess it’s possible that Bitstamp initiated the transfer but the delay is at your end?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:20:31
Gah. Didn’t want to hear this. I also have a large (for me) withdrawal “in process”. Only requested a withdrawal on Saturday but could do with the money asap. Did you ask for a SEPA bank transfer? How long have you been waiting?

Eh? Houses are bought and sold for sums close to this all the time. Money always paid in full, in a single lump sum.

Does 950 BTC (2012 value) seem a reasonable price for a 5 year old HDD? Even if you go back to the beginning of 2011 that's still almost a grand. Far too expensive, surely?
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:57:09
So there's no way someone is charging $1000 or more for that HDD in the picture (1BTC = 1$ in 2011)
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:52:47
On a side note, this is a good way to spot houses that aren’t well insulated. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:21:18
Well that would help explain the extent of the anti-BCH bile. Sellers remorse. I just find it strange that “HODL” is the catchphrase for this place yet so many people seemed to have reacted impulsively/emotionally after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:57:35
Kudos on managing to sound unbelievably patronising without actually sharing any useful information. That’s quite an achievement. I would never claim to be an expert on cryptocurrency but I’ve a reasonable grasp of what makes Bitcoin valuable. Hence I’ve owned a fairly substantial number of them for just over two years now and have no intention of selling them any time soon.  As for the perfect timing of your “rational trade”, time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:24:57
The “tax purposes” thing is interesting. How do you record a loss on something which cost you nothing?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:57:59
Jesus this sub is hard work. BCH is worth more now than it is was when it was first available to be bought/sold. Is there any part of that sentence you want to disagree with?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:16:02
Am I the only one bemused by the way so many people on here are obsessed with knocking BCH? Surely most of us own some? I have exactly the same number of BTC as I do BCH. That’s how forks work. Been delighted to see both of them increase in value since.  Is nobody else in the same boat?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:54:39
Allowing yourself to get repeatedly punched in the face is admittedly none too clever but sticking your tongue out mid-pummelling is a whole new level of stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:28:01
Again with the condescension. I’m well aware what a fucking strawman is. Just like you’re well aware what my point was re the timing of your trade. But there is one thing we can agree on. This is exchange has been a complete waste of time. Cheerio. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:07:54
Now you’re just being thick. “I sold at a ratio better than the ratio right now. Therefore I sold at the perfect time.” Aye, that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:56:51
Well you’d be a lot better off right now, financially, for starters! I know I’m glad I sat tight instead of reacting emotionally immediately after the fork. It was free money, as far as I saw it, so no harm seeing how things develop. It was never an either/or decision. You could have had both types of cryptocurrency without spending a dime.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:41:42
Bit strange the way the guy being interviewed conflates using a blockchain to track the deeds of properties with using cryptocurrency to purchase them. Similar tech but miles apart in terms of implementation. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:51:54
Ok, educate me. Where in the world is any government even close to using blockchain technology to administer property deeds?
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:59:53
Aha. My bad. Common turn of phrase where I come from. Ironically, a country that uses km on all road signs, speedometers etc.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:40:52
Wow. That’s interesting. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:54:08
Yeah I’m familiar with the concept. I actually think it’s a really cool idea. But the regulatory hurdles are massive. So much harder to get off the ground than cryptocurrency. Just found it odd that it gets a mention in a story that’s about a very different use of similar technology.
