Framing this as *resolve* is one of the weaknesses of the bitcoin investing community. Emotion-suppression is still emotion-centric investing. Instead, have rules and follow them.

I think the recent $20k peak and slide since can be best compared to the 2013 $1100 peak where it took over three years to get back to that level. I'd expect bitcoin to relax back to maybe $7k this year and maybe $4k next year.

I used to write financial news for a major daily. We always had to come up with a reason for market moves to show the audience. 
Sometimes there's news. But the real reason for most moves is that the interaction of buyers and sellers exhibits random characteristics.  
There are meta trends that explain why a month might have more down days than up, or vice versa. The stock in question got over-valued and that's reversing slowly, for example.
But the editor wants a reason for that day's move. So you find one.

This is good logic for figuring out the most effective cryptocurrency. But, for the very same reasons, good logic for finding the cryptocurrency most likely to end up in the sights of the government.

The presumption that a thing must have inherent usefulness to have value is where you go wrong.
Three examples:
Fiat currency
In each case, the thing has high value not because the slip of green paper, heavy lump of metal or word stitched onto the handbag is itself valuable (obvs there is a tiny bit of inherent value in paper, heavy metal and stitching, but not much).
The value comes from *a human agreement that the thing is valuable.*
Watch the bitcoin price as an argument about that agreement. The more people who agree it is valuable, the higher it goes, the fewer that agree, the lower it goes.
My private view is that the argument ends with us all agreeing the coin is not valuable. But I can see alternative scenarios where that doesn't happen. Humans can be awfully emotional, prone to herd thinking and hard to predict.
After all who'd think that gold would retain its value years after the development of fiat currencies backed by governments  with nuclear weapons. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:34:46
Your unwillingness to believe something with no good use case can be valuable represents ignorance of what this species is like

This is why I mentioned the handbag. (also you can substitute baseball cards or starwars figurines here if you like).

You seem like an educated person, with a good understanding of science. You write well and your statements seem mostly true. 
But I think your dismissal of claims to truth in prediction is too negative about the use of a probabilistic approach. Predicting one coin flip is impossible, but understanding heads and tails are 50:50 is a powerful insight. Even events that haven't happened before (like the emergence of a new asset class/currency) can be considered probabilistically using Bayesian techniques.
I would note here only that there is a chance bitcoin becomes wildly valuable and a chance it does not. That is not the same position our "rock solid" friend has.
I also suspect you're a bit over eager in your condemnation of the ability of humans to control for confirmation bias. It may be innate and unnoticed, until it is noticed. Then the smart investor tries to control for it. Sure, that's not as effective as a double-blind experiment, but it gets a better result than the one 100%-certain-OP gets with his mad enthusiasm.

Money is just lubricant for the amount of stuff that an economy can produce. Being able to vary the amount of money as productive capacity changes helps prices stay predictable.
The only reason you wouldn't want that - the only reason you might want the amount of money to stay stable as the economy grows - is if you own money and you want it to become more valuable (i.e. you want great deflation so the buying power of assets rises.)

It is impossible to distinguish a bubble from a price rise until the price falls again.
It is possible Bitcoin's price will never fall.
However. The value of bitcoin has risen extremely quickly. In the past the most rapid price rises have quickly turned into price collapses. For example, the late 2013 peak at $1100 was followed by a long slide to below $200 during 2015.

Problem is nobody has convinced me that this the network effect of crypto is as strong as the network effect of the whole internet. I'm massively unconvinced we have a winner takes all situation.
In crypto the network effect is balanced strongly by a get-in-early effect.
Diversifying into shitcoins is going to be a repeating cycle in crypto because everyone saw what bitcoin did - it came out of nowhere.
This is more like looking at facebook as a business than as a user - the stronger the monopoly the more you have a strong motivation for competitors to enter and for investors to back that entrant.

The difference is obviously that nobody ever claims that what makes the NBA so amazing is its rules. In Bitcoin people talk non-stop about how its value comes from its rules. Code-based currency overthrowing the global monetary system etc.

I've never owned crypto but I've followed it for quite a while. I'm not at all new but i'm also not deep in the game. I am also disinclined to believe a lot of dogma or acceptd wisdom.

Unlike facebook though where there are only costs and no benefits to using a new network in a crypto network there are benefits to using a new network - the possibility of scooping up thousands of coins before it goes big.
This is the dynamic that has caused thousands of altcoins to be born.  Obviously most of them have proven to be shit. So my question is very narrowly focused: If you harness that willingness to start a new coin but piggyback on the proven technical design of bitcoin could you have yourself a winner?

This is good info. It makes me understand something I didn't understand before  -
which is that when people say:
"What makes bitcoin amazing is its *code.* That's why it will change the world," they are omitting something. Because if you can copy the code and get nowhere, the code is not the essential element. 
Basically I think what makes Bitcoin strong is that people agree it is strong. So they build an eco-system around it. There is a virtuous circle between the degree of faith and the size of the eco-system.

The difference is that in business you're not allowed to exactly rip off the source code of facebook. In crypto you're permitted to exactly replicate the source code of bitcoin.
Businesses try to rip off each others ideas all the time. This is why I'm fascinated by the possibility of legally replicating the basis of Bitcoin. It's like if the recipe for Coke were on the internet or if the seven secret herbs and spices were seven commonly-known herbs and spices.
There's a a proven winning formula and no rule against using it! 
@_date: 2019-01-04 03:22:56


This is an interesting idea I hadn't heard before. The higher the market cap of Bitcoin the more its spending power and therefore the more of the global econom it can account for. Is that right?

I wouldn't expect it to surge right now when excitement is at a low ebb... But imagine a time when bitcoin is at 100k and I was offering you something with the same technical parameters at $.10

Here's a question: what stops someone from inventing an "altcoin" called Bitcoin 2 which has the exact same technical properties as Bitcoin?
To me this is the difference. Both are pretty secure but one can be replicated *ad nauseum.*

I guess by cloning bitcoin exactly I'd be trying to differentiate myself from the shitcoins. Using a counter-intuitive approach.

The question is: In the theoretically identically fertile soils of an identical protocol and ledger  could you grow an equally abundant network?
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:19:20
I expect such a coin would be deemed nearly worthless at launch. And that'd be the point. It'd be like Bitcoin circa 2008/09. Easy to mine, cheap to buy. The question would be over time, given it has the exact same specs as Bitcoin, whether the price would, slowly, converge. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:36:32


That's what every altcoin is - an attempt to beat bitcoin!


It would be true if there were never upsides to getting into a crypto at the ground floor, and only upsides to using a well-developed network.
The network effect is real. Facebook or other social media benefit from the network effect where as much as you might want to use a different network you are trapped using the one everyone else is on. (shout-out to voat.)
Crypto is a bit different where early adopters of new systems *sometimes* see huge payoffs. It mitigates the pure network effect of crypto by raising the expected value of using a new system.
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:54:59
I'd say to people:
*Heard all those stories about how people could own a thousand bitcoins just by running their laptop overnight? The glory days when Bitcoins were worth $.001?  With this coin you can go back in time to that era and own something that works exactly like Bitcoin at a fraction of the price.*
*What have you got to lose? Get mining!*
If it doubled in price within 2 years from $.001 to $.002 it could still be judged a success. You'd never expect it to fully converge with original bitcoin. But the closer it got in price to original bitcoin the faster you'd expect the convergence to go.
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:16:15
I hear bitcoin people saying that what makes them trust bitcoin is the code. 
Unhackable. utterly trustworthy. etc.
My idea was that the code is replicable. If it is truly the code that makes bitcoin good then bitcoin can be remade over and over. 
But the more I ask people about the idea the more they say replicating the code doesn't replicate what makes bitcoin good. Turns out what makes bitcoin good is not the code alone but the code and the eco-system that supports it.


I agree with this. That would not work because the international bux would have less backing than the real bucks. And also because nobody would expect them to be worth $1 each. But a second bitcoin would have ultimately the exact same foundation than the original bitcoin and could be expected to be worth a tiny fraction of Bitcoin's price to begin with.. Over time a network could grow on that foundation, right and that price could slowly converge with Bitcoin's price? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:34:03
Dude's point is that not many people really believe in bitcoin. A lot of people believed it had a lunar trajectory, sure, but few believed it had any sort of terrestrial purpose.
That latter kind of functionality, and the extent to which people believe in that, puts a floor under the value of your cryptocurrency.

The motivation for adoption would be that the new one has the same code behind it but costs a lot less.
@_date: 2019-01-06 11:43:07
The answer is that on paper it's no different to bitcoin so you might convince some people it should converge in price. Their beliefs would drive the price up. 
Basically it lacks the weakness that afflicts all other altcoins, "it's not as good as bitcoin."
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:41:45
Thanks. I like to question the fundamentals. 
People tell me what makes Bitcoin special is its **code**. I can see that the code is replicable. So I enquire about what would happen if the code was replicated. People then tell me it's not the code that makes Bitcoin special. It's something else.
In this process I learn something about Bitcoin, about the Bitcoin community, and about the stories the Bitcoin community tells itself.
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:31:45
I'm legitimately interested in bitcoin.
But when I drill down into the beliefs of the biggest fans and come out with handfuls of dust I do start to wonder whether it's all nonsense.
If you're unable to describe a clear reason you're involved with it you either have no insight into your own motivations or you are unwilling to share those motivations. 
I therefore assume you are:
1) Speculating. (Which I am fine with btw, if I get involved it will be in the expectation of a relative gain in buying power - whether by spending bitcoin or by transferring back to fiat.)
2) Insuring against calamity. You perceive a huge breakdown in fiat money or banking systems is coming and Bitcoin is the best hedge you can think of. (in some ways this is not different from (1)).
3) Bitcoin *is* like a dog or art to you. You get enjoyment from holding bitcoin and thinking about it and engaging in discussion about it. It's a hobby no different to, say, collecting model planes.
Perhaps a blend of all three.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:10:05
Of course if you sold all those crashes and bought the dips you'd be so far ahead of simply holding. 
You don't even need to time it perfectly. If you can avoid even 20% of each falling trajectory by selling and buying again a bit later when the price is lower you increase your stash of coins. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:07:30
Litecoin is very similar but not identical. I guess that allows for a stronger justification of a price difference between the two coins. In theory it gives litecoin upside over bitcoin whereas what i am pondering would never have any case to be worth more than bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:20:20
If I understand this then the  thing controlling the supply of Bitcoin is the brand recognition of the original. If everyone became aware the mirror-world Bitcoin was identical then the supply of Bitcoins would essentially rise?

It's not easy but it explains why some people sell in a falling market: they hop to buy back a little later.

The apple analogy is deeply unhelpful.
bitcoin is more like gold. A potentially stupid thing with few uses but very limited supply. And so long as everyone agrees it is worth something it remains worth something.
Gold has a good solid history of being worth a lot. Bitcoin is about 5000 years behind but off to a decent start.
Now of course there are a lot of other precious metals out there. Bitcoin might turn out to be more like silver.

Sonic booms are an example of an externality - when a transaction has impacts on people other than the buyer and seller.
Externalities most famously include pollution and they are the major reason for government regulation.
The biggest externalities of bitcoin are these three:
1. The carbon impact of electricity use.
2. Facilitating money-laundering and tax evasion.
3. Potentially disrupting government supply of money and undermining existing financial systems, with unknown effects.
Just as a note, you can have positive externalities. Seems most bitcoin people expect  to be a positive. I take more of a Chesterton's fence approach. We live in the richest era in history and while things are still terrible for some people it's a much smaller share than in the past. 
Each of these three externalities is a major risk for governments regulating crypto.

That is because the other four crashes were chosen specifically for being big long crashes. It's selection bias.
We don't know for sure if this is a big long crash yet, or a short sharp one.
I personally think it is a big long crash, but I'm aware these comparisons don't prove it. It think it will bottom at about $4000, sometime during 2019
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:26:28

All your analysis of how value is made is spot on.
I really disagree with you about the nature of the market manipulation that's going on. There is the occasional headline that's crazy. but if you follow investment markets that's common - it's how markets publications get clicks: "Crash looms," etc.
(If you're talking about rumours of Asian countries banning Bitcoin then look, maybe investors *should* take that risk seriously. I don't know how long bitcoiners can frame the currency as an anarchic attempt to destroy existing financial institutions and not see some pushback.)
I think the market just got ridiculously overpriced. If there was bullshit affecting the market it was on the way up. Bitcoin is settling down to a way more reasonable level. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:20:57

This is a pretty decent dscription of how market cap works and how price is determined. good one.
It's also well-written, in a kind of Irvine Welsh offensive sort of way. Good job on that.
But the problem you have is that you can't control the market. You're a price-taker, not a price-maker. The market is the sum of so many human interactions that even a thousand well-written reddit posts won't do shit. 
Holding out, or even hodling out won't make a lick of difference on your own. Unless you corner the market, like Fuckface.

The cost is an indirect result of the code isn't it? Bitcoin's price is not coded in. 
The price is a result of market forces. And people buy it because they like the way it is coded - because the way it is coded makes it useful unhackable, scarce and pseudonnymous.

The same is true of shares. If Zuck tried to sell his stake in FB all at once he'd flood the market and not get the full value currently ascribed.
Also of property. If everyone in town tries to sell their house at once, prices aren't going to be what they were.
So market cap depends on supply and demand at the time of the calculation. Luckily that's the natural level of supply and demand at that time. Unlike this hypothetical scenario where everyone is selling.

As a non user of btc, I think there is far more resistance than true negativity.
In the same way most people can't be bothered using Linux or eating healthy or getting a tailored suit. The experts tell them it's miles better. But the cost of changing your life patterns is high. 
You have to have a great product that is a) OBVIOUSLY great and b) really easy to use. Like an iPhone. 
Another shortcut to overcoming adoption difficulties is making a technology "cool" and if there is one thing Bitcoin isn't, it's cool.

Thinking out loud: Is one of the charms of monetary systems their mostly monopolistic/universal nature within a given economy?
I've just been writing a thing about the economy of Venezuela and it seems that having various currencies there, with various rates of inflation and various exchange rates, has been a source of real economy problems.
OTOH, Greece. One of the problems there is definitely that the rate of monetary growth has been too slow, while the exchange rate has been too high. i.e. the monetary policy of the ECB was poorly matched to its needs. A currency used broadly was bad for Greece.
Is it possible the fact we got a lot of economic growth in an era with a bunch of different currencies each matched to an economy is not a coincidence? idk, would be interested in discussion.
