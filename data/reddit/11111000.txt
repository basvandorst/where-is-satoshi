I like the Hörnli, too! When can I get a Schützengarten there with btc ?
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:04:17
thank U! 2$

welcome! have a paperplane on me!
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:52:35
hmm... looks like my moinker doesnt work..... once again! 1 paperplane
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:44:41
yes, connected. refresh ...  nothing happends.
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:21:57
I tried but nothing happens. pressing "preview" - nothing. seem to be overloaded...?
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:37:51
I do whenever I can! Then I try to by back at lower price (which was easy this year).
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:41:09
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:23:07
thats actually why I took this pictures. had also one showing "007". 
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:20:54
you can get them at adafruit.com too. with bcd and high-voltage drivers
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:10:39
work for a 4-nixie version is in progress.
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:09:32
you got the point.
I'll be happy to redo the work orbuild a new one every time we need more digits. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:29:00
use your imagination. (can't post image in comments in reddit)
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:03:39
if you have some electronic skills it's not so difficult. it's basically an arduino with an ethernet-board and the nixies with the old bcd-to 10 drivers for the nixies. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 08:59:36
it shows the bitcoinprice, taken from bitstamp (1011$/btc). the digits are old nixi-tubes from an old counter (~1970). till yesterday I was fine with 3 tubes. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:41:43
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:20:57
nice one!
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:10:45
you can even delete your breadwallet and receive bitcoins to that addresses. 
(be shure you have written down your recovery-key in order to spend again)
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:57:27
this example is not a good example to rebuild:
data from a https (bitstamp) api -&gt; read via php-webserver -&gt; http read by an arduino with ethernet -&gt; serial link to a pic micro, that drives the nixies. 
my next approach would be without the pic and (maybe) without the webserver. I made other installations that use the webserver as a relay.  so the webserever is kind of practical if I want to change the data-source for all of them. 
to build your own get nixie-modules at adafruit.com (edit: discontinued) with highvoltage drivers and powersupply. they match perfectly to an raspberry-pi or arduino. (arduino does no https)
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:06:36
I'll will look into making more than just one prototype and will tell you here. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:10:35
it was 1011$ now it shows "904"
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:15:20
exactly. right now "867"
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:48:16
bitstamp.net or kraken.com
circle.com with visa/master
I don't know what ACH is. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 08:51:30
flash crash back to 800?!
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:29:23
no problem - it's easy and save. make shure you write your passphrase for recovery down on paper - anybody with a little bitcoinexperience can help you with this information to recover your bitcoins. the GUI is not very fancy but technically all what you need and working perfect. the feeling is a bit like early browsers (gopher)...

from now on I always upvote anything with Bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:31:24
to play around try also this: send $0.20
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:13:52
and when will be bitcoin 1.0 ??? finaly out of beta?
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:01:54
any bitcoin atm in your area?

SWISS !!! =&gt; Switzerland &lt;&gt; Sweden !!!
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:56:54
will this produce some testnet-altcoin ?
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:57:12
looks like a good deal.
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:43:02
@_date: 2015-04-18 19:11:16
I had a similar problem - got stuck with about 2 month left and took forever. I didn't find out what it was. enough diskspace was there. I tried then on an other computer and it worked fine. (the first one was an old windows XP system)
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:20:03
... and earn bitcoin for downvote ???
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:53:46
from now on: America == Africa - both with A.
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:19:26
maybe it will never hit 1000$ again. who knows...
@_date: 2015-03-22 20:42:16
:-) yeah.... reditor since one hour.
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:31:28
is there a nice software to do that ? I think this could be a pretty idea to store amount in a personal picture - good for mass adoption!
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:47:22
Ohh - hello and Hi !

1. sorry, never heard
2. seems good that everybody can buy within 3 hours but....
3. ...didn't work for me because of "Sorry, there are no orders available that match your criteria at this time, please click view all orders to see a complete listing."
@_date: 2015-03-08 23:09:00
how about a software that is even more intelligent ? like generating keys of a picture even if the picture doen't have the same "checksum". to recover it will only be needed to take the same picture again. find something and save it for later. eg. your favorite beer bottle. keep it in a save place and take a picture when you want to recover the keys. software could do that !
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:43:33
why do sheeps run all in one direction ?
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:42:48
try it out! here you have some bitcoin: 1 paperplane
@_date: 2016-05-26 13:14:52
I have the same problem! any fix?
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:50:04
works fine on iphone breadwallet, Quick Scan an others - but only with the bigger pic.
@_date: 2015-03-14 09:43:51
what about  ?
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:30:56
try to post it on @_date: 2015-02-01 22:10:40
use a bitcoincalculator and you'll find out. you can enter all your circumstances:
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:22:23
can I use bitcoin as a browser to search the web ?

great work! 1 paperplane.
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:59:46
du mix sweden with switzerland ?
maybe you are thinking of:

false: I'm not a terrorist.
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:58:36
:-) thanks - but If you use it on an old offline-only pc there is will no way malware will make its way out of the pc.
I think we should have some nice software to use like bitaddress.org with pictures as seed - and it must be able to recover the keys with the same pictures. so I can put a stick with my pictures in a save place (as cold storage) and someone robbing my stick will find some pictures of my cat or what so ever...
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:48:44
I don't get it but sounds exciting!
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:06:31
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:46:35
looks nice to me! a bit of a complicated veryficationprocess. look at kraken - for testing a service with small amounts there should be less veryfication needed.
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:21:21
good job! my average is still 520$.... @
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:58:44
you're helping the terrorists?
