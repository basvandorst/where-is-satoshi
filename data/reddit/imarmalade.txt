Just need to invent some kind of common short-hand.  11/(M)C maybe?

Perhaps lmax's designs are inferior, but they have done much better planning with their hardware?

Not a single person has *ever* lost their deposits in an FDIC secured account.
We can discuss the failing of the American fiscal and banking system all day long and not run out of things to talk about, but attacking the FDIC seems a little odd. They are very narrow in what they do and have never failed to do their jobs.  (*as far as I am aware. Feel free to correct me with reliable citations*)

Even in highly regulated market we get people like Bernie Madoff.

Are you not clear on what the FDIC does? It insures that your savings account won't be lost if the bank goes belly up.  In that mission it has never failed. 
The FDIC isn't there to keep bank managers from being idiots.  That's what the Securities and Exchange Commission is for.

Except for all of those thousands of times when it worked exactly as intended.

Yeah, this kind of deflation can't be good for a currency.  I'm not an expert, but it just doesn't feel right.

It actually doesn't. The amount of risk a bank can take is strictly limited by the the federal government.  In addition, the FDIC never pays out directly to the banks - almost without exception a bank is in the process of being cut up and liquidated when the FDIC gets involved - the bank owners have already lost everything.  Bank stock-holders are paid after depositors and other debt.

The phrase "on paper" has an accepted meaning. Don't play childish word games - it adds nothing to the discussion.

If only there were countless examples of extreme growth leading to massive crashes later on.

That's not what "on paper" means.
