That makes sense, thanks for the explanation.

Isn't it just going to make bitcoin more volatile?

Yea I have been getting a lot of flak for spreading FUD, that was not my intent. While there are other possible scenarios for what is going on, such as my account was already compromised and I was only made aware of it because they just pushed out the login notification system (I know a great, almost genius alibi). I wasn't aware that you couldn't liquidate off MTGOX and wanted to spread the word ASAP. I may have jumped the gun, only time will tell. Nothing was taken from my MTGOX account wich is kind of weird. Even if you can't liquidate you could sell my bitcoins for like a penny each. I don't know the whole thing is a bit muddled. Im off to bed though.
EDIT: Actually i think you would sell my bitcoins at market price then use the money to buy really expensive bitcoins (If thats even possible).

what is that?
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:46:17
Let me rephrase that. You weren't showing anger over the internet. More like wearing your heart on your shoulder. Taking yourself toooooo serious. I don't know, lighten up a bit?
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:16:44
Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt... All day?
My first post about this was 1 hour ago, to let people know that some funky shit was going down with MTGOX.
You are doing the opposite of FUD, you are encouraging blind faith and trying to infer that people don't steal bitcoins all day every day. You are pretending that that whole fiasco with SR2.0 didn't just happen. You are pretending that the world is made of teddy bears and corruption/scandal never happens.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:43:40
To be fair I was trolling you because you were showing anger over the internet. Why so serious?

ha! its even from a different IP then mine.... I would put money that people that have money/coins in MTGOX are about to lose them TO MTGOX
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:59:43
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:17:55
Yea, I am now aware that that was a fake. I should edit my original post.

@_date: 2014-02-14 14:56:27
Thats fine, I think bitcoin has a long future if not tough future ahead. I just wanted you to understand the intent of my trolling, anyways I'm off to bed, good luck with your crusade!
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:01:30
I was thinking more along the lines of they JUST implemented this sytem that tells you when someone logs into your account as an ALIBI that they didnt take your money but some hacker did.

@_date: 2014-02-14 14:38:55
Yea someone else pointed this out to me. This is definitely a second possibility.
Like I said before I may have jumped the gun, but I wanted to get the conversation started ASAP and possibly save people their money. I was not aware that you couldn't liquidate off mtgox anyways. Cheers.

Not to mention its deleted now I believe and also they say they disabled logins however I can still login with my password...
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:28:18
Did you take into account

@_date: 2014-02-14 13:17:49
I personally did not as I have barely anything in mtgox, I'm not even verified.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:12:03
That did not occur to me, good point. I know that I may have jumped the gun on this, but warning others as soon as possible seemed like the correct action. I was not aware that no one could liquidate of MTGOX anyways.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:57:22
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:37:53
You understand I don't care if they are being hacked, I am just letting people know that the moment they enabled login notifications my account got hacked. I logged into MTGOX earlier today and there was NO login notification.
Am I to believe its coincidence that as soon as they enable login notifications they are "hacked"?
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:34:45
No but I didnt have anything to lose. I am just warning others. Anyways I'm not exactly sure how 2FA works but supposedly hackers got all the info in their database anyways.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:38:53
Thats what I'm saying, what hacker in their RIGHT mind would hack MTGOX KNOWING that you cant get money out of it anyways, It smells like an inside job through and through.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:04:59
I find it convenient that the first time I see the message/email its because someone else logged into my account from a different IP smells fishy as hell. Possibly a half assed way of covering their tracks.
Could also be a major fuckup by the developers testing the system. Like a massive life ruining fuckup that drives MTGOX's prices even lower then they are now lol.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:30:48
I shouldn't be worried that a chinese IP has logged into my account and its the first time I have ever got a notification of a log in? okayyyy... 
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:24:10
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:03:43
Not so sure its false, this email may be but my account was accessed by a chinese IP.

The media?
