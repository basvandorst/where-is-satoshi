They will never implement bitcoin with its chief advantage for a retailer/seller...irreversibility.

Wrong. Not a positive for bitcoin.

As a high volume seller, there is zero chance I would use bitcoin via ebay/paypal. One simple reason, for myself personally bitcoin is only attractive from a retail point of view because of it's inherent resistance to fraudulent chargebacks and reducing risk in transactions that might not otherwise be contemplated (ie shipping to Russia/Brazil). To link the two would be inherently counterproductive. 
Involve Ebay/Paypal into the mix and that advantage will be forcibly removed. With Ebay bending over backwards to compete against a monster of a philanthropic foundation masquerading as a business (re: Amazon), their only trump card is to play the role of Sheriff and market unlimited buyer protection.
 
After the demolishing Paypal has taken in the mobile payments space in recent years they will of course not dismiss any new technology, but don't expect them to ever implement bitcoin in any fashion which the users of this subreddit would find remotely attractive. I do not see any scenario where Paypal remotely involves itself with a payment technology which is irreversible by a third party to the transaction.
What you should be concerned about is new forms of digital currency/money transfers being implemented by these entrenched institutions and the implications of their interest in this space with respect to future patents on their own spin on the technology and what that means for future lobbying and regulation efforts. 
TLDR: this is not a positive for bitcoin.
