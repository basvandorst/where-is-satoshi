Passive income is money going into your pocket. Unless you sell bitcoin it doesn’t matter how much it increases in terms of passive income.

What happens when you want to withdraw though. That’s the main concern.

Hi mate, any guides on how to get started in bitcoin, got some expendable income I was looking to put in some risky stocks. However, the recent rise in bitcoin is tempting me.

Don’t they lose everything in the episode though?

Any time the calls for “we will never hit this number again” come in, i know we are close to peak FOMO.

What buy signals are you looking for?

Interesting, I’ve been doing some chart reading myself recently, and every time Bitcoin jumps 1k in a day, there’s generally a 40% retrace within the month. I can see it dropping to around 3.8k-4.2k, although I have to say I think the bottom is in. However, if your patient you can still pick up the top coins for quite a bit cheaper than they are now.

I really don’t know how you can expect a dump? I very much doubt it will just keep rising. I don’t think we can go from a bear market to a bull market in the course of 2 hours. It’s generally long sustained momentum, just like in 2017.

How long have you been in crypto? Every bear market there is a dead cat bounce at some point. I have a feeling this could be it.
Obviously, feel free to jump in it’s your money, but just be careful.
