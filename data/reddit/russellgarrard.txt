Surprised the answer isn't 1BTC. Why would it still be measured against FIAT?
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:51:46
Can we stop this shit... Now is clearly the time to accumulate. The longer it takes the more we can grab
@_date: 2019-12-15 08:12:07
Once this security issue gets figured out it's definitely upwards
@_date: 2019-12-17 11:14:55
Hence why I said driving adoption. With enough Bitcoin in enough wallets some people will want to start spending it and not just us geeks HODL'ing
@_date: 2019-12-31 01:15:56
I'd be ripping that shit out as soon as I can, you could pay someone enough cash to let you rent a place off the books to disappear for a couple of years at least. Break all ties off with anyone I know and live under the radar while continuing to funnel it out. Some into bitcoin, some into offshore banks, some into cash etc.
@_date: 2019-12-13 10:22:53
He's right... Bitcoin IS worthless...
What creates it's value is what we will be able to purchase and transact with in the future. That's what will create worth.
For a person in his mind being able to generate wealth from almost nothing except a computer and a few kw's of electricity scares the living shit out of these assholes. They are used to being on the top rung of society and it scares them. Particularly because they don't understand it.
@_date: 2019-12-16 04:34:39
This seems like it's over-complicating something...

Scrypt alt coins possibly. But you'd be sucking down a bit more power and introducing interference in the gaming machines which is what you don't want
@_date: 2019-12-18 07:00:25
Anyone else remember Picklerick's on Cryptopia? I bought it at 200. Watched it drop to 80, wanted to get my money back so placed an order to sell at 210 and watched it hit 10,000 before the 'hack'
@_date: 2019-12-08 08:53:34
That's why you do your research and then hedge your bets.
@_date: 2019-12-12 10:10:43
It's not an 'All or nothing' investment. It's more of an 'As well as'
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:57:29
I'm actually going for all the alt's. I just missed the boat on bitcoin. I'm a percentage man.
@_date: 2019-12-12 10:03:43
Amen to this shit! So much better to fly under the radar
@_date: 2019-12-30 05:16:21
Plus you can listen to the baseball game anywhere in the world...
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:21:15
Or you can ride the bumps :)
@_date: 2019-12-10 12:16:15
I don't think about what the coin is worth now but what it will be in the future
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:11:34
Please no... I'm still accumulating
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:19:30
Lol? Not much... It's a collector's item but the value is whatever someone wants to pay
@_date: 2019-12-27 03:20:22
IT consulting? Advising people on what parts to buy or how to design a system?
@_date: 2019-12-13 11:05:24
Yeah, assholes who are out of touch with reality and common suffering. Being rich is one thing, being as rich as he is? What a prick... I can guarantee he didn't get that filthy rich by treating people well
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:07:19
If you are running a serious business then always, ALWAYS plan for this!
That being said india is rife with corruption so I highly doubt he's dead
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:46:44
Please no... I haven't finished accumulating
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:30:58
I just bought 1000 DGB for about $10AUD... DA FUQ?
HEAVILY undervalued! I'm putting aside money each week for crypto and mining
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:46:18
Idiots...  
With the cost of gas do you think anyone would have any money left in their account?
@_date: 2019-12-11 12:34:55
Definitely not...
But Bitcoin will definitely play a decent part in the future. I don't think it'll work for every day transactions but as a store of value. Sure.
@_date: 2019-12-08 05:01:57
Crypto winter is definitely over but hopefully the market approaches this more rationally this time.
The market will hopefully be searching for actual value and utility.
Coins will go up but hopefully not so rapidly
(I was young and stupid last rush I must admit)
@_date: 2019-12-09 07:41:43
I'm hoping it's someone trying to shill... I don't have enough crypto yet!
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:47:52
He's probably just trying to FUD so he can buy in lower
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:59:20
When you realise the market is still largely held by a few large whales then it starts to sink in
@_date: 2019-12-23 07:25:32
An S9 mining BITCOIN will return you absolutely NOTHING! (AWESOME for small alt's though...)  
Complete scam
@_date: 2019-12-17 10:49:37
Amen to this! I'm trying to sell shit around my house on Gumtree and am seriously pondering taking crypto by negotiation
@_date: 2019-12-23 11:44:20
Mate... We get it and fully understand it. Eventually when it's used enough it'll start becoming more stable and the relationship between crypto and fiat will become less important
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:15:41
I don't. I just like the fact I can mine and buy this shit when I can't even afford to buy a brick wall
@_date: 2019-12-17 10:17:33
Obviously someone harpooned Moby Dick
@_date: 2019-12-30 12:06:57
I just need to accumulate :)
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:02:37
Well there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 Satoshis :)
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:28:07
You want to know what helped with my anxiety a week or two ago thinking I missed the boat again? Don't give a f\*\*k...  
I'm mining alt's, hopefully will be able to pay off enough debt to buy the major's. You know the ONLY thing GUARANTEED to drive the value of bitcoin up? (I know it was just said above me). Getting out there, showing support, marketing and driving adoption.
Shit... I'm pondering getting a few crypto shirts made up and wearing them around. 
Bitcoin is worth NOTHING, crypto's are worth NOTHING compared to where they will be in 10-20 years time with mass adoption. This is just a small bump in the road.
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:06:23
Sorry... Not enough bits for me
@_date: 2019-12-30 13:02:34
Until you realise that you just helped an elderly woman send free BTC to a scam artist in Africa...
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:15:55
I'll go check my accounts with them right now. Most likely small amount of alt's
@_date: 2019-12-25 12:33:27
Screw that job! If it was true you'd do the job with just a backpack to blend in or go all out on the trained mercenaries. The security bill alone just to ensure your safety doing the delivery would easily get to a couple of million if you chose that route!
If you went the backpack and were tracked you'd be fish food in minutes
@_date: 2019-12-08 06:41:46
It is... There is activity and mining going on. Firming up on certain coins etc. Could well be another 2-3 years away before it really starts churning. I'm planning to buy, mine and HODL for a while yet. Get my house in order. I already have my 'Lambo' so no need to worry about that
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:42:39
Passive... My take? Try and buy low but if you are constantly trying to judge the market... Some coins are so cheap now you might as well just buy anyway. Think I bought like 1500 doge for $4 the other week
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:38:46
I don't know what the legal situation is like in your country in regards to Bitcoin but maybe buying/selling computer/mobile phone parts and repairs? Should be easy enough to explain away due to the tech knowledge involved.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:39:22
I'm still wondering who it's owed to.
@_date: 2019-12-21 12:43:39
Started laughing until I realised it was an actual prototype. I'm amazed actually!
