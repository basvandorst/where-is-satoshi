It does to everyone else. 21 Million Bitcoin = 2.1 Quadrillion Satoshi
If each Satoshi = $0.01, 2.1 Quadrillion Satoshi = $21 Trillion
For comparison, the USD money supply is currently [~$13.8 Trillion](

For reference, [this]( is what a series of 50% increases followed by 50% decreases looks like. It is why posts implying equivalency between an x% decrease and an x% increase are misleading.
e.g. A 100% increase followed by 'only' a 60% decrease is equivalent to a 20% decrease from the original value, **not** a 40% increase.

If a government sends a thousand troops to fight a war and they all die, what should they do? Should they quit at a thousand lives, unsuccessful but with limited loss of life, or should they send another thousand troops to their deaths despite the fact they'll most likely be as unsuccessful as the first thousand troops?
The former option is logical, reducing the number of deaths, whilst the latter option gives the government pride, integrity, honor, resolve and improved public opinion even if the actual results are worse.
This is know as the [escalation of commitment]( or 'sunk cost fallacy', where you continue with a bad decision in the hope that your further investment will prove that your previous poor decisions were not in vain despite the fact that it is more likely that you will escalate the severity of the situation.
In other words, quit while you're ahead, and even if you're behind where you started, quit while you're ahead of where you will most likely be in the future.
Edit: Grammar and spelling as well as revised structure.

I don't understand how, given that you understand the tech hasn't changed, you view $19.9k a month ago as more valid that $1.0k a year ago.
