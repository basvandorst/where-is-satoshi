Thank you, that's much better than I ever could describe it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:28:01
No need to give me credit for the picture or anything :P
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:20:32
I didn't even realize I cropped out the dates, but everyone can check it, just check the chart :)
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:50:55
Right. Sometimes one exagerates a bit to make a point. You also have to realize that once segwit is ready to activate, under the current conditions with miners, they know about 2 weeks in advance, with UASF they know in advance when it will activate and get everything ready in time.

See Charlie's tweets and bottom of the article. There are more issues with BU that will lead to multiple accidental forks. It's just not stable.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:29:33
They have enough money to give gold but not to pay a normal tx fee.

Context is available in Core slack and another screenshot was posted with context. Nice try though. So who's btc mod's troll account are you?
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:04:56
Thanks. I like being liked. ;)

They only had small buyers, big buyers never went through circle in the first place. Small buyers have no influence on the price. Also they are referring everyone that wants to buy Bitcoin to Coinbase through their affiliate link.
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:54:09
I've been around for a long time :)
@_date: 2016-11-15 15:05:03
I'm not pissed about the blocksize debate. But it's over and Ver is trying desperately to try to gain support/control. Even if it felt like that for you, if just 1 person saw his true colors because of it, it's worth it.
@_date: 2016-12-16 14:15:20
Obviously they only start once BU is activated... Didn't think I had to explain that to you Thomas. Now, even though they are flagging as BU, they are basically just running Core.
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:26:48
As did I :) 
@_date: 2016-12-16 14:45:30
Hi there paid sockpuppet account. I wrote many articles, including the factually accurate Segwit ELI5.
@_date: 2016-12-16 12:32:34
Mining on BU will guaranteed cause one (unwanted) fork after another. Talk to any developer that isn't  pushing BU.
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:56:38
All facts though, well except for the part about viabtc, which I also mention. I can't prove that, just got some sources on that I trust :). What isn't helpful is that 1 person is trying to steer Bitcoin in a direction that the majority doesn't want. His statement yesterday about Samson having to get fired for posting stuff on social media was for the last drop to write it.
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:50:44
So an attack Vertor ;)
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:19:46
That's fine and he isn't. However there are different ways to steer something. Using positive influence or using negative influence. For Ver it's the latter.
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:49:07
How is that shit slinging? And anyway someone already posted part of the logs in this thread now :) If someone has my respect, I'm not going to share things shared in private. If someone is trying to manipulate the entire debate again and trying to use invalid excuses... Then I get annoyed and point it out.
@_date: 2016-11-15 20:44:14
Damn my spelling errors after 4 hours of sleep and writing in my 3rd language...
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:07:33
It isn't since there is no direct link to it, it's all public information. Then you're basically not allowed to link to any website since I'm sure that in 3 clicks I can always find an email and phonenumber.
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:50:32
Note that he also said that Alex Petrov would probably be on even though it would be pretty late for him, but that's in another screenshot.
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:22:16
Hi again cypherdoc, it wasn't. He's clueless and intentially posts lies. Multiple devs talked to him, pointed out how wrong he was, he just prefers to spread fud.
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:38:03
Nice, thanks! already done.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:31:37
But but but... adding more complexity is THE argument against Segwit... Maybe switch to Segwit? @_date: 2016-12-05 18:36:38
Hi, no a paper wallet is fine too, however it isn't used that much and it's a bit more complicated to set up. I wanted to keep it simple but still secure.
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:51:31
DAO customers sure paid for it.
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:37:14
I'm not paid to be neutral. I always give it my own twist, else there is no point for me in writing it. But I understand your point.
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:08:16
The "dox" was according to them the whois, however the whois was not directly on reddit or even in the article, there was no screenshot of it on the article either. Just a link to an archived website which happens to be a whois.
@_date: 2016-12-09 06:54:00
Except all BU devs and the whole subreddit
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:20:53
I don't know how to tell you this but I'm kind of a big deal.

I am not, nor would I ever post anything I didn't believe in myself. I try to be the counter balance for his bold lies/halftruths. I make plenty as a trader/consultant and don't need to do this for money :)
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:53:19
Damnit, I'm on the wrong side then. Too bad I actually have a brain, use it and I'm too ethical to be bribed :(
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:02:08
Actually if there is some truth in the Purse story: 1) Purse &amp; Bcoin (same company) wants to spread awareness of their implementation and they want to solve the scaling debate so they go around and ask what miners and exchanges want. 2) When they get to Jihan he says "oh I love extension blocks, I think they'll be useful". Putting that idea in their head. We can assume he did his research, knowing it won't break ASICBoost. 3) BCoin devs get home and see EB as only solution and claim it was their idea. 4) they make everything public and Jihan immediately supports it.
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:31:04
Most of the replies from my tweet are coming from 1 guy, bitmain marketing guy who's trying to spin the story.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:35:31
From your translation: "At that point, Jihan passionately stated his position: “I love extension blocks.”". That was before the development even started, so he actually gave them the idea of using EB. Which isn't really surprising since that's the 2nd time I heard it in 3 days.
@_date: 2017-04-08 13:22:11
Bitmain CEO Micree specifically mentions EB in an interview from February 2017: 
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:43:38
Strange indeed. Just speculating but there might a NDA involved and that they indeed got a donation no strings attached... NDA would explain why they don't confirm or deny it.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:25:45
Maybe you should list which bank you're trying to withdraw to. I withdrew EUR yesterday from Bitstamp and got it today.
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:32:21
That wasn't quite the point I was trying to make, my point was that it's odd that he's allowed to give financial advice, that could've made people lose millions, while working at Cornell. My real criticism was that he keeps posting bullshit articles that get debunked immediately and he never bothers to tweet or write a correction. Very dishonest.
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:06:02
To be fair there are 2 options: 1) Full refund; 2) mining - electricity cost. Of course your miners are being used to block segwit but the Bitmain marketing guy can give it a nice spin: "You're getting a good deal because our electricity cost is probably lower than yours"  (  )

Hello paid Roger Ver shill, can you point me to what was mistranslated?
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:58:08
Since a lot of people seems to want to discredit the entire log because of my poor choice of words I changed it to "Timestamped". What I meant was that the timestamp was verified.
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:38:17
There has always been a clear connection between Bitmain and Roger Ver. for example used to work for Bitmain and is now doing business development for Roger. He will not say anything bad about his strongest ally.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:22:13
I think the actual point that people are missing is that according to these claims: Jihan proposed extension blocks. Since he knew that it wouldn't break ASICBoost
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:30:19
I edited/added some more things in the conclusion and screenshot/link of Yours saying they're going full BCash :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:00:46
Important to note from the homepage: "Can I do this myself? - Sure! By all means dump your B2XCoins and get more Bitcoins. We’ll even show you how! It just requires a bit more technical knowledge and work."
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:16:22
Of course he isn't and he never was either.

That's Bittrex cold storage... nothing to do with MtGox.

~4% up to next halving.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:04:20
10-11% per year iirc

Where do I do that exactly? I even own some ETH, since I'm a trader and it's profitable to invest during a bubble, just have to get out in time. I'm warning people since most, less experienced traders or investors won't do that. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:54:18
Please tell me where I said that Ether had no value? My credentials speak for themselves, I'm a trader, I know markets. This is a bubble and unsustainable.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:04:46
You're assuming they have PoS finished and that it isn't bugged and that Ethereum will not fork in 2 coins then.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:33:10
Right. Unlike people who claim to know economics like Mr Ver, I actually did study economics ;)
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:25:42
Token creation is through a smart contract. Besides that other smart contracts are very expensive at the moment, but fair enough I added "at the moment" to the sentence. Ethereum developer Vlad also agrees with that :)
