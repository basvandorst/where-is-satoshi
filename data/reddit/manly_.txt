It is entirely speculative on your part that vitalik could reverse transactions. You do have the right concept that decentralization is about more than just running more than a few nodes (ie: not neo, dash, etc.). It means that you could block any given part and it would still stand on its own. But you said that bitcoin has the most decentralized network, which implies you were talking about the nodes themselves, not the ecosystem. As a result I corrected you. I am not here to declare either more decentralized than the other, but ethereum has :
* far more developers using the platform
* about double the node count
* if by consumers you mean transactions then that too it does fare significantly better. I dont see how any interpretation of consumers is related to decentralization, but whatever
* it is indeed considerably worse for mining though. But it does have pos on the way to fix that, for which bitcoin has no alternative.

The reason? Risks. You want to be sure your code base using the channel is secure and free of bugs, as well as handling all the possible bad things that could happen. It also requires you sending data outside of the bitcoin network to the other party in order to inform and agree upon that, for example, the next 0.1btc I send on the channel is sent for the person with address x. This code is not trustless. This code requires the exchanges to work together on a standard.

The 3 days is the mechanism used to keep the channel indefinitely open. It means that any party much confirm by then whether they both want to keep the channel open, and if either party can’t respond or disagrees it will still go through.

Sadly what you mention is not meant to fix scaling. It can reduce signature sizes, but it doesn’t do much to address fee issues. In fact, LN is the sole proposed solution to the matter, with no alternative work being worked on. Whether or not LN delivers, strategically it is a poor position to be in. And now this thread just reinforces the fact that LN itself will be built slowly piece by piece, as well as being dépendant upon external factors that go beyond coding.

The opening of a channel is *not* recorded on the BlockChain. The opening of a channel is put into the mempool, where no nodes are bound to respect keepalive this transaction. The time a transaction is kept on an individual node mempool is a setting which isn’t enforced. A LN channel is literally a normal transaction, but one that isn’t activated until a delay (usually 3 days). The idea is just that whenever you’d send funds, instead you update the transferred amount upon the same transaction and then delay it further. You keep updating an IOU until nobody touches it for 3 days where it will activate and then *possibly* be picked up by a miner and added to the mined block eventually. You don’t have any guarantee of that happening. In fact, anyone can open a channel with zero network fees, use your funds, wait for it to close, and then possibly enjoy the funds never be transferred ever. The only option left to the “receiver” is to make a new transaction that reclaims the funds of the stalled channel for 2x the price.
Ain’t it beautiful? Yes, it is less secure. Anything without 6 confirmations should be considered unpaid.

That’s not true actually. Ethereum has double the number of nodes over BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:31:51
A lot of this is false. The transactions are bigger, the difference is that the utxo data is moved to a separate part of the block that isn’t compatible with legacy code. The fee calculation is given a reduced cost for the bytes stored in the SegWit data, but the total transaction size is by no means miraculously smaller. In fact since SegWit the block size got renamed into block weight, so as to differentiate the SegWit part from non SegWit part. The blocks are now 4MB block weight. So much for people saying that a bigger blocksize would bring doom and gloom, only to do it and nobody being the wiser.

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:29:53
You are correct to say that a channel funds are *only* moved towards one end of the channel should an attacker do this. In other words, in the attack scenario given, say a channel exists between A-B, then that channel would have 0% A and 100% B as far as the funds are concerned. Which leaves any transfer from B to A open. But the entire topology is nevertheless affected by this. Because you can selectively force transfers in one direction, you can essentially lock people out from using the network.
Let me take your example to show my point;
D &amp;lt;-&gt; B
D &amp;lt;-&gt; C
E &amp;lt;-&gt; B
E &amp;lt;-&gt; C
D wants to send funds to E. The choices are [D &amp;lt;-&gt; B &amp;lt;-&gt; E] or [D &amp;lt;-&gt; C &amp;lt;-&gt; E]. If A can put all the funds of these channels in the wrong side, then D cannot route through E. In other words, if the BE channel and CE channel is balanced in a way that E has 100% of the funds, then D cannot send to E. Since said whale can pinpoint which direction the funds are, he can lock out a specific node from being able to send funds. Or as many nodes as he wishes. 
Edit: in essence I am disagreeing with you that A can’t force BE and CE to have the funds all to CE. A just needs to do multiple transfers, each pinpointing a specific channel.

Thanks for the fair and well posited response. To be fair I see no alternative to a percentage fee, given that the costs need to be spread amongst the users of a channel. This seems like a sensible design as far as those fees are concerned.

So just to be clear; I do agree that CPFP exists, youre free to push a child transaction that relies on the stuck transaction to force both to go through. But you still haven't challenged my very core claim:
We went from a secure system where transactions were not secure until 6 confirmations, to one without any. CPFP doesnt change any of this. It is inherently less secure. If many people do this (because hey, you're forcing the other party to handle the network fees for you!), then we only increase the mempool which makes the very issue worse.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:12:21
Fees per value ? So let me get this straight. The whole point of the bitcoin is that no matter how much is sent, you pay a flat fee. Now you’re telling me that if you send funds over LN, then it’s a percentage ? That sounds like that, in itself, kinds of defeats the whole purpose.

I code for a living, I did not read this from anywhere, I’m just telling you how it works. The LN channels are using normal transactions under the hood. Once you close a channel, it hits the mempool where that transaction will remain unconfirmed until it gets added to the BlockChain, which might be never. Especially if a lot of people are doing this because free double spends at no costs are quite enticing.

Only problem is, any large enough whale can completely force a centralization of LN, and nothing can be done against it. 
If I am a large whale with say 10000 BTC, and I don’t like competition, what’s to stop me from sending funds to myself by passing through every small LN channels I don’t like, forcing the, to close because I’m using all of the locked funds? Rince and repeat every 3 days. Since nobody knows the origin and destination of the full path I can purposefully make a super long path that goes through every LN channel, just to create even more junk transactions. And after I’m done closing down every competing channel using LN the way it was meant to be used, then I can open my own centralized hub!
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:19:18
The usage I described involves none of that. It’s extremely basic. I open a channel, let it settle (which doesn’t mean anything beyond waiting for it to get broadcasted so people know the funds are locked). I intentionally set it to zero network fee. At this point it is on the mempool. I spend the funds on it. Since I began the transaction, nobody else can increase the network fee - there is only the owner of the transaction that can do that, unless you want to suggest segwit was a sham. I close the channel. Transaction sits on the mempool with zero network fees, with no incentive for miners to add it to a block. Thus it stays stuck in limbo forever, until it gets potentially dropped from the mempool (remember, until it is added to a block/confirmed it doesn’t mean anything). But the whole LN payment allows you to bypass this security entirely, which was my point.

Were a long way from global adoption. Problem is, there’s a lot of friction, especially just to get started (get your first cryptos). So I get that for now we have to compromise just to gain some traction, and let go of lofty ideals. The real issue is that the current banking and credit card system comes with little apparent downside from most common use. People don’t “see” the 3% price increase across the board and only think they get a free 1% cashback assuming they pay right away. Point is, there has to be a benefit to justify using cryptos, and right now it’s a ton of friction in order to bypass the ease of use of banks/credit cards. Right now, if something goes wrong with the bank/credit card, you know you can go just about to the street corner or call the credit card company and get help right away. With cryptos, odds are you just lost everything and that’s that. I don’t believe cryptos need that level of infrastructure; I’m simply illustrating how pervasive the friction is comparatively. If cryptos were easier to use than Apple Pay, then who knows, there’s maybe real potential. From regulation, to price instability, to many things, to even simple things like being able to pay without electricity or internet access, it’s just really lacking in terms of using cryptos as a currency.
So yeah, it might be a step in the good direction seemingly for now, and it does help lower friction, but it doesn’t inherently give a strong reason for anyone to ditch credit cards. Maybe for inter-country transfer that’s where it shines, I’m not entirely sure where else it is clearly better than alternatives. My real worry with this is that as we will creep closer towards adoption, it’s likely those existing services that have done us good to gain adoption, will just end up making it bad to use anything else besides them. Kind of like, they’d make it hard to leave their systems, so people end up just using their service and the momentum is too big to stop at this point. Kind of like Facebook (although it never had any benevolent intention at any point).
I’d say that, somewhat sadly, we’d probably be best of waiting until the tech is mature enough that it’s ready to scale to global adoption, and then we build on top of that. If we just compromise at any point, the path of least resistance is likely to take over and we’ll be fighting an uphill battle to maintain a trustless system.

Put simply, if bitcoin was meant to avoid banking, we sure did everything to make sure it behaves exactly like it.

Well, I get that you argue that transactional fees are intentional and gives incentives for people to mine blocks even if the mining rewards goes lower over time, but the issue is that when you can only fit ~ 2000 transactions per block, once per 10 min, you can immediately see why it's nowhere near enough for mass adoption.

The default values used to be 3 days then transactions would not be kept in the mempool. But that default value was updated to 2 weeks a while ago. And from experience I can tell you that because that value is merely a default and that no node is obligated to stick to it, if only one node decides to keep your transaction alive forever then it is kept forever alive. You can't rely on your transaction leaving the mempool.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:06:09
The reason you can't easily checkpoint the BlockChain to speed up the initial sync is simply because no matter how you try to make it, it leads to centralization or relies on trust. Both of which are anti-bitcoin. No matter what signature system you try to come up with, even if there's some sort of consensus amongst nodes that one checkpoint is legit, you can't rely on that info because that is simply gameable. And worse yet, how would you know that the nodes you connect to are not working in communion to try and poison other nodes into accepting a completely new fork of the BlockChain? You simply can't. And anyway, the whole point of bitcoin is to be entirely trustless. As soon as you want to rely on any kind of precalculated data, you rely on trust. The only way to do this would be to have the BlockChain somehow store that checkpoint within itself (i.e.: the checkpoint would also be validated by everyone, which would add a tremendous slowdown and extra data storage). Maybe you could store the hash of a checkpoint at certain blocks intervals, and provide a way to share checkpoints across nodes if and only if the latest checkpoint is requested. But then you still run into 2 issues; 1- do you want to risk a potential vulnerability in that hashing algorithm? 2- How do you deal with orphan nodes? People could legitimately have different blocks from node to node because they don't propagate the same nodes. This is further worsened by chain splits.
Pruning has the exact same issues. But worse, because pruning assumes that all that matters is a valid state and that you can still validate blocks. While unpopular to some, the fact is transactions have been used to store non-transactional data (OP_RETURN is an obvious example, but it can be done many ways). Pruning will quite simply wreck this.

I'd love for someone to explain to me how LN avoids double spend attacks. Since many people say that LN payments are not broadcasted, what's to stop me from opening multiple channels from the one transaction I got my funds from, keep all channels open indefinitely, and since my funds aren't claimed until someone closes the channel the network has no way to verify I did any double spends (since with LN now zero-confirmations is considered paid).

For iOS, I feel like any non-open source option isn't a good idea. I know someone else mentioned breadwallet, which is open source. 
With this said though, I do greatly hate breadwallet severe lack of options, like décidé in which format I want BTC to be shown, the pass codes being limited to 4 numbers (serious ugh) and lack of way to import a private key/wallet in any other way than a QR code. I get that it's unsafe to copy paste a private key, but even bitcoin core doesn't support displaying generating that QR code so I have to assume it's non-standard and just encodes the private key. And it doesn't offer any way to export its private key either.

I think my biggest personal gripe with bitcoin is basically tied to the block size. I mean it's current valued is mostly derived from the exchanges, which for the most part don't really do bitcoin transactions (and they couldn't -- it would overload the mempool). I understand that increasing the block size means the decentralized nature is likely to become more scarce and thus less secure, but right now it just can't be used for micro transactions, which if it were not for blocksize/transaction fees, would be an absolute perfect fit. I read somewhere visa does 2000 tx/s, whereas BlockChain can't do much more than 1500-2000 tx/10min until we increase that block size. It's really not suited for mass adoption with the current values. It affects confirmation delays too. If the tx fees were like equivalent to 1 penny or less, I'm sure it would be used completely differently. And I know that to push towards, say, 0.1 penny per small tx would mean a major blocksize increase (32 MB?) but I think as an actual user I would far more prefer that than get the feeling that it's adoption will be stunted because it just can't become a de facto trading standard as it is.

Well, technically yes. You can restore a private key using a pass phrase that frustratingly they provide no information about its inner workings. But for that restore to work you need to have had the app previously installed and it gave you that passphrase. That part is fine but very nebulous on details - can I import that passphrase on another device not connected to my iCloud account? No idea. If I delete the app does it remove the iCloud backup of my data? Again, no details. They make it sound like all you need is that passphrase but given the algorithmic complexity of a large private key I don't see how the passphrase it gave me would make a private key of a decent size (i.e.: 4096+ bits, although I have no clue how BlockChain addresses private key sizes are). But I strongly doubt that that passphrase is an agreed-upon standard shared by multiple applications, so for all intent and purpose you have to use the qr code to import any wallet. I know it's not secure to import wallets and that you're better off swiping/moving the funds, but there does exists legitimate reasons for this, such as multiple platforms handling the same funds (android and iOS).

It can't be done by design. A LN channel is just one unconfirmed transaction that is kept unconfirmed on purpose (since confirming it means committing to the blockchain, and thus pay the network fee). 
Say I want to send you 1 BTC. Normal process is I make an unconfirmed transaction saying that this previous transaction where I got the 1 BTC from goes to this address. Normally this unconfirmed transaction remains in the mempool until it is added to a block/becomes confirmed, where it costs you the network fee. What LN channel does is that that unconfirmed transaction is kept delayed for 3 days. If nothing is done to it in 3 days, it will automatically go through and activate (and thus close the LN channel). The repetitive network fees are zero because all the LN channel does is update the number of BTC transferred and keep delaying the closing of said channel. So you basically say 'oh im sending you 0.0001 BTC', and then every new 'sending' is just you increasing this number on the unconfirmed transaction. But you cannot add more funds because the origin of transaction funds are always another transaction.
The important part is this: You *do not* say the funds come from an address, but from a transaction. This is why bitcoin has dust amounts that cant be reclaimed. If you do not believe me, have a look here:  Because you send bitcoins from a transaction and not from an address, it is impossible to add funds to a channel.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:31:08
The initial topology is not the concern. The LN channels can’t have funds added to them. You can only send what’s in them when you open the channel. Meaning, in short, that over time you can expect a centralization of those hubs, merely because it *is* advantageous to open LN channels with as much funds as possible, and that saves you the fees for reopening another channel. The natural progression will lead to a centralization due to this alone, regardless of topology.

I don’t think you can open more than one LN channel from one previous transaction. That would allow double spend or making some LN channel received funds that would get cancelled by the mempool.
In other words, if an exchange open up LN channel with you, you can receive as much as they had when it was opened. The exchanges don’t want to split their funds too much because it costs money to do so (network fees). So say they pick the best fitting channel to open with you based on the estimated amount of funds they plan you’ll receive from them. Based on their choices between 1, 5 or 10 BTC channels (for example), they use the 1 BTC channel and open it up with you. You receive 0.2 BTC, then 0.1 BTC. But then you decide 1 month later you buy more. There’s a good chance that the exchange needed to sell those 0.7 BTC because it was unable to use them until it closed your channel. So for that you’d have to open a new channel.
You cannot expect everyone to have massive LN channels kept indefinitely. The more the currency is actually used in L1, the less there are available for everyone to open with each other. It’s a game of imperfect information and future planning. Don’t expect transactions to be free because you can keep updating an IOU until you settle for an amount. The hubs come at a severe centralization cost. The upside is that those hubs don’t compromise on trustlessness, but severely remove any kind of pseudo anonymity.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:04:17
You are correct. A channel can only transfer the funds that are within it. If you have 1 BTC, do 500 transfers totaling under 1 BTC, you’re fine, but the channel can’t send more than what’s remaining in it, and neither can you add more funds to it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:41:36
Problem is, you can’t really buy just one mBTC with the network fees, considering you need to to pay to receive and to spend. Until that much unit are actually spendable, we’re doing the people a disservice by using mBTC for pricing.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:50:15
That is incorrect. The txin of transactions are another transaction in bitcoin. Since you can never change old transactions you can never change that amount. What many people confuse is that you can 'send two way' your funds, but thats kind of semi true. If I open a channel with 1 BTC to you, and I send you 0.1 BTC, then you can send back that 0.1 BTC. Thats the only replenishing that can be done. If I send you all of 1 BTC and need to send you more, I have to open a new LN channel entirely.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:43:36
All I said is that on a LN channel, you can’t add funds after opening the channel. You can only send up to the amount that was stored on the originating transaction, and this goes both ways (the counter party can’t “return” more BTC than what he previously received in that channel). There is no replenishment ever.
In other words:
If I open a channel with 1 BTC on it, send you 0.6 BTC (no matter in how many sub-payments), then you can “send” me back 0.6 BTC at most. And I can’t send you more than an additional 0.4 BTC.

I professionally code/design dispatching software for truckers, as such, I have a fairly good idea of needs for this. Indeed, this is NP hard and isnt simple to solve. I'm used to deal with constraints such as "how do I split a few thousand pickups/drops in such a way that all dates are respected, with a few drivers/vehicles as possible, using the least gas, while accounting for refueling while &lt; 20% and using expected price variance and seasonal gas pricing shifts while also accounting for potentially saving a lot of money if you fuel in states with lower fuel taxes". In essence, LN is a very simplified form of this, but not without its complications. In trucking, distance between stops matter, in this case, it (currently) doesnt. The number of stops does though. In terms of graph terminology, you want to minimize sum(traversed edges distances). That is, you want to travel the least total distance across your fleet (I'm simplifying things a lot, but generally this is the overall goal). Here, you want the same thing, except that instead of distance, your 'distance' weight is actually the LN fees. \*Currently\* those tends to be similar value across channels, and thus, something we can simplify down to "ignore this completely, just find a way to do the payment". This can very well change in the future if people start to ask more and more for using a channel. But for now, we'll pretend that using any channel for any amount is the same % fee. Using this assumption means that you can divide up your transfer across as many channels as you want (ie: you can split up 1 BTC transfer across 20/40/etc. channels). The big difference here however, is that you do not know the landscape ahead of time. I don't know if there is a edge between the vertice x and y. Moreover, I \*might\* know there is such an edge, but I don't know how much can be transferred through it. This problem repeats itself for every hop I go through. Additionally, even if I did know how much capacity is in one given channel, that value is only partially correct and reflects the amount that was available when it was sent from node x, not the amount it might have once I do attempt to use it.
In essence, you have a shifting and unknown graph topology on which you try to find a shortest path algorithm (D\*, A\*, dijkstra). Apart from D\*, they all assume you have full network topology known ahead of time, so I doubt they would perform as well as it might seem. Furthermore, if you assume you might get a lot more node making it hard to solve, you might want to look into some clusterisation heuristics to favor low-fees channels. I'd venture a guess and say look into hierarchical pathfinding algorithms, as well as D\* if your channel data tends to be unreliable.
tl;dr You can't solve this optimally with incomplete information. You'll never have complete information.
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:49:13
If you could pre-commit your routes, then basically you'd have the entire thing solved. While I did say you cant solve it optimally, the problem is that you essentially don't know if a route is possible or not. If you could pre-reserve for a short time, then you'd basically bypass the problem altogether.

(fortunately) Theres no timestamp components on blocks. They added later on a block height (hidden in the coinbase) because it was kind of a silly omission, even though you could recalculate the blockheight assuming you had every block headers. If there were timestamps, which time would you take and/or trust anyway? It can't be done because you'll never come to consensus over that value, unless you consider it ok that whoever mines a block gets to put whatever value he feels like.

I suggested a far superior solution. To my knowledge nobody has done it before.

Well, I can recommend a custom levenshtein method with specific add/remove/replace weights. The best implementation I saw was the one from PostgreSQL. In this case you’d want a hamming distance of 4- if I were to make a guess. And possibly penalize harder on specific similarly looking character replacements (i/l/L/1 are weighted heavier than say d replaced by x). Then once you’re past the hamming distance, immediately cut off the computation.
If that can help, I already have easily readable c# source for this method.
Also potentially consider double metaphone matches for similarly sounding matches. You’d have to do some preprocessing for this beyond the normal algorithm since it’s not made to handle numbers. Just throwing ideas.

A browser plugin is an easy example, however it could be also just be part of the base browser install down the line.

MITM attacks can be mitigated by a multitude of ways. Technically SSL prevents those but it doesn’t protect you if you connect to the wrong website (but everything between you and the fake website will be MITM-free). It’s the very reason private/public key encryption was created in the first place.  The issue is that you can’t easily store a full public key in a cookie, but if you could, that would defeat those type of attacks. The thing is, you need a pre-established secret between you and the website created on site creation, and sadly with the current web architecture, the fraudulent website can always pretend that secret isn’t required and the user would be none the wiser. It’s really just that http wasn’t built with that as a problem to begin with.
The simplest solution I can think of would be to code a browser plugin that alerts you whenever you visit a website that is spelled similarly to another one you visited in the past. That sounds like a feature that all browsers should consider having.

Because you can never rely on cookies. Cookie size is not standardized. What might work on one browser will be truncated on another. And not all browsers will store cookies anyway. But yes, you could try to store the pubkey on a cookie, you just can’t know if it will fit and still be there the next time you go on the website.
There’s additional issues with cookies. They’re per-domain *mostly* as far as sizes are concerned. That means sub-domains potentially share the same cookie size. That means on a big website with multiple services that pubkey storage could make other sites lose their cookie data and vice versa.
The public key exchange is the ultimate pre-established secret. But you could also use zksnarks and exchange one secret piece of info and never divulge it again. Basically the issue is that browsers are not made to handle fishing attacks.

I have used a few times bitcoin yes. I actually coded a full BlockChain parser and went through the technical docs to do so. It's kind of irrelevant to the conversation though. If you buy something with bitcoin and it shows nearly immediately as paid/sent, then it simply means it's in the mempool, and thus unconfirmed. The blocks are created every 10 min so it's quite unlikely that you would get a confirmed transaction under a second no matter how much fee you would put in. When you transactions "go through" it just means they are sent to the mempool; there is no inherent guarantee it will be picked up in a block. You would get the same "going through" immediately if you put a 0 tx fee. I didn't mean to say you knew or didn't how to use it -- I was pointing out that if a store let's you leave without a confirmed transaction, and that store only relies on seeing the transaction shown on the mempool (it going through), then you could set the fees low enough so they would see it as paid but you would have a strong chance to never disburse any funds.

If you remove the blocksize limit there's literally no reason it wouldn't handle every cash transactions. A ledger is a ledger.

Your argument was that on-chain transactions can't compete with credit cards and real money. I pointed out that it isn't true because it could handle it. You come back and say it would lead to centralization? Well, my point stands then; it could handle it, it's just somewhat unrelated. The original vision of bitcoin was anticipating every node would also be mining so I guess turning bitcoin into something else entirely isn't out of the cards. In a way I feel like that's what SW is, but I am not arguing for or against it. Whatever solution we end up with, the current fees make bitcoin unusable.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:24:49
If you pay your coffee using bitcoin but set the tx fees to zero, the coffee seller will see your transaction appear immediately (in what is called the mempool, i.e.: unconfirmed transactions). Usually people put an appropriate fee so that that transaction goes through in a decent amount of time, but putting it intentionally at zero fee almost ensures that your funds will never be sent but still show up as you having had tried to pay your coffee.
The BlockChain allows for 1 block of 1 megabyte every 10 minutes. That translate to roughly 2000 transactions per 10 min at the most. Every transaction has to win an auction to be included in the next block, where it is recorded for eternity. That fee is your "bid" to have your transaction included in the coming block.

Ah I think everyone had their excuse to not be rich and buy at the start. I was very pro-ecurrency and loved the idea when I read satoshis whitepaper, but the only reason I'm not a multimillionaire today is because I didn't feel like installing Linux to run a bitcoin node to store my bitcoins on. It seemed simply too complex to set up even for someone that codes for a living, so I just forgot about it. I put in a lot less that you did, but it's small enough that I don't even care if it goes to zero. I think long holding is a good plan as well (basically we're both hedging on the politics of BTC being resolved at some point in the future and this should open the doors to lower fees, make it accessible, and increase its value. I wanted to buy yesterday at 2500 when I learned worldcoinindx delisted Korean exchanges that were trading at 2800, sadly though the time it takes to transfer funds are just too long for inter-bank transfers in Canada (and easily 40$ costs too) meant it wasn't going to happen.

I'll explain in rough terms. Not every wallet software has code to adapt properly fees. And even if they did have adaptive fees, there's been a newer suggested way to do it that saves some fees. In any case, it boils down to the implementation of the wallet software of how much fee it reserves per transactions. And that software might be obsolete.

Forks represent a lot of code to rewrite. From full nodes, to wallet clients, to code to handle the potential double currency, to code making it clear which currency you're modifying, to new websites (BlockChain.io and whatnot).

Soft-forks it really depends. Code should still work on soft forks but it depends what you do.

I have run into the same issue, moving a low amount of BTC and setting a very low tx fee since the amount is low. I expected my transaction to clear off the mempools after 72h if it didn't go through, but now it's been over a week and it seems like the transaction is being kept alive even though I even purposefully shut down the sending node for days. I am almost wondering if it's done on purpose as a "legit" way to worsen the BlockChain but having nodes configured to never let any transaction expire.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:27:14
Well, you misunderstand how it works. A confirmation means that your transaction has been put in one block on the BlockChain of the main branch. When you do a transaction, you pay a fee, which then adds the transaction to the mempool (unconfirmed transactions). The mempool is basically a pool of transactions for new blocks to pick from so that they can reap the most tx fees, and yes, that too is synchronized across the decentralized bitcoin full nodes. 
When you start that transaction (i.e.: pay your invoice), you 100% always send the transaction to said mempool. It might or might not be picked up by a block. If you set, for example, 0 tx fee, then there's an almost guaranteed chance it will literally never be picked up in any blocks, which means the BTC are still in your possession, and that obviously the seller of coffee has never received your money. By default transactions in mempools over 12 days are discarded.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:57:42
Breadwallet doesn't let you adjust the fee. I know since I was a user in iOS. I also sent them an email for a feature request to which they never replied to, which made me personally wary that they might not update their software in the case of a chain split.
Absolutely nothing is stopping everyone from putting 0 fees everywhere. The worst part is that tx are supposed to disappear after 12 days by default if they don't go through, but some nodes in the network keep transactions alive forever in a "legit ddos" to speak of. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:21:42
There is always the however unlikely possibility that either a flaw in the protocol gets found out (say, someone breaks sha256 collisions) or that the BlockChain gets taken over by a sustained Sybil attack (51%), leading to double spend attacks and confidence in the network taking a major hit, probably killing its value. I mean, if we're talking long term like 10 years it's not out of the realm of possibilities.

Yeah there's a script language for how to run transactions. It has no loops intentionally. But it was never formally put in a whitepaper. I know since I searched specifically for it as I wrote my own BlockChain parser from scratch. The official documentation literally says to look at the source code to figure out how that scripting language works. Which is kind of very appalling, but whatever. The foundational papers of bitcoin basically describe the BlockChain, which is the real innovation.

No problem. I just hate how most of the time people tend to not try and make an argument. It's like if people tend to care more about "winning the argument" rather than being right. Personally I don't quite buy that SegWit will magically allow unlimited off-chain transactions, because that means you just move the problem elsewhere. Those transactions have too be stored somewhere even if it's not on the BlockChain. And once you're at that point you kind of lose the advantage of what made BlockChain transactions so great.

@_date: 2017-05-29 02:38:46
Well, I appreciate the condescension, and yes, I do happen to code for a living so I have a decent idea. The network can handle higher loads. I am not saying it should, because that would be prohibitively expensive to run such a node at today's prices. Right now there isn't much incentive to run a node to begin with because bitcoin is kind of unusable for common transactions with the currently prohibitive fees. If however you look into the future and assume a steady increase in storage capacity and equally so internet bandwidth, then I could totally see having a real reason for many people running a full node assuming bitcoin were to handle visa-level of transactions and become a de-facto standard way to buy/sell things. All of this is obviously irrelevant right now because nobody sane is calling for unlimited block size, specifically due to the aforementioned issue. It should be scaled up gradually; the contention is that that scaling up is not part of the white paper, and neither was layer 2 stuff, so doing that implies a hard fork, which obviously we want to avoid whereas realistically possible. You have to understand though; as far as the BlockChain is concerned, there is no inherent capacity limit; basically unlimited transactions are possible. SegWit isn't a hard requirement to do so. The real issue is that you want enough full nodes that are able to handle the lightweight client requests at a reasonable speed at the very minimum. Without that, the decentralization fails to provide the service. Theorically if there were just one full node and it could handle all requests then that would be enough for bitcoin to work, but obviously that is not what we want. Ironically, this isn't so far off from what off-chain transactions are -- the specifics of how the off-chain transactions are completed might be centralized or not, it is impossible to know.

I don’t get the point of your post. Obviously, LN right now is able to find routes (without pre-commits). But the whole point of OP was whether this can be scaled, as many people outside this hivemind have pointed out that its unsolvable. Problem is, mathematicians define solvable differently than regular people. For a mathematician, solving chess would mean optimal play. Every possible play analysed. For a layman, solved means it works sometimes. As someone that has spent a few years on route optimisation, I’m pointing out that you could have a near optimal solution if all you did was pre-commit routes with a time limit of say 1 min.

Hah, well I be damned. I verified and you're correct. The irony is that I did write a BlockChain parser and I admit I did not recall the specifics. It's weird though that that field specifically is stored in 8 bytes whereas every other big numbers nearby are stored in their weird VariableInt format (1-9 bytes). In any case I stand corrected.
I'd point out though that if we do need to get to that degree of precision, the satoshi recommended minimum fees would be pretty much required to be adjusted.

I think I should give more credit to LN. Those RFCs seem a heck of a lot closer to a working solution than the 70 page paper that originally came out. This seems fairly complete. I can't imagine much reason it wouldn't work. It's just setting up IOUs through unconfirmed transactions, onion routing with channel broadcast. I'd be curious to see how much data a SPV client would need to keep track of the channels in order to set up the onion routing. Maybe I should get back some BTC before they resolve the current impasse.

Like iOS does. By default ask for a PIN, but put an option to use a password instead of the PIN. If you do that, obviously you encrypt using the pin/password. This way you get either the usability or the security.
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:11:50
That's not actually true. Using the defaults transactions should die off and exit the mempool after 12 days, but some people configured their full node to keep alive transactions forever in the mempool, resulting in a "legit ddos". I know since I have some dust amount that have been there for a month despite me not even running my bitcoin software at all.
With this said your wallet might allow remaking the tax with higher fee to "unblock" it, or if you're totally out of options there's transaction accelerator services where you pay with your credit card the mining pool and they prioritize your transaction. Also viabtc offer this service for free.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:56:38
Yeah I skimmed the 70 page paper on LN. It indeed didn't mention hubs much either, which made it super awkward as many people keep saying LN will allow super scaling bitcoin, which is kind of a wtf as all it allows to do is basically consecutive transfers to the same person without additional fees. Because outside of that case, assuming no hubs or anything, as you are describing LN it doesn't offer much scaling benefits for any case of non-recurring payments.
The real issue will be how to deal with determining which hops to route over, since every hop is limited by how much funds are in the tx/address of that channel.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:53:09
Don't worry, this will push cryptos into zkSNARKS proofs which can be used to hide information. That and onion-routing between payment hubs.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:22:47
Hm. Well that's one way to do it for sure. I can't imagine that being very slow, considering every hop would know right away if it's got enough funds to forward to the requested destination. Could easily handle a few million of those per second. I'd be curious to see how long it takes to sync the broadcasting of the channels. I guess with the current 7000 ish full nodes that would be pretty much instantaneous.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:06:45
I find that hard to believe. It's a ton of data to synchronize. And by the time you receive the packet telling you how much funds are left on a channel, that amount will probably have changed. And as far as I know the transactions underlying the Lightning Channel aren't broadcasted in the same way that the mempool is. In any case, I can't imagine a sane way to implement that.
Edit: Furthermore, this means a severely increased load on SPV client to keep the state of those channels (which I doubt are synchronized as pointed out above). You would also have to maintain state of a list of payment hubs. And if you want to support payment hubs, *because* of that funds limit, you massively increase the centralization of the network. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:29:30
Not a totally bad move, but your pre-fork BTC sent to the exchange might not be given back to you as a pre-fork BTC. If you hope to get double the value so that your old BTC gets both coins, I'm not sure that would work by doing that. But I am open if I am missing a crucial detail.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:28:11
Pretty sure that is incorrect. SegWit is a compromise mostly done to avoid a hard fork. If data was actually moved, that would require a hard fork because the data structure typically read by old code would be incompatible. As far as I know, it adds a transaction hash in order to prevent transaction malleability, and adds another merkle tree which takes into account the new data in addition to the old one. This way old code can read the same data as before, and new code has the ability to read the transaction malleability fixes part.

You do realize how fucked up it is if someone discovered that the app from his bank stores the password in plaintext on disk and when asked about it the developer just tells you "well it's meant to be a hot wallet!"? I get your argument that some users prefer usability and no password, but the fact that there is no way to tell the app isn't meant to be secure is no excuse for it to not have the possibility of being secure.
And yes, I get that the security of the device covers most cases, but it means that with the current design, if any cop or border crossing agent decides to confiscate your phone and compels you to unlock it, it's trivial to make a backup of the device with iTunes and then read this data and get all your funds.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:59:45
Hm, I don't mind the deliberation but I can't help but think that I believe in the exact reverse of your conclusion concerning the need to have fragmented cryptocurrencies. If you view cryptocurrencies as just money, and that they are equal, then the more the total money is spread on multiple cryptocurrencies the easier they all are to attack on a Sybil/51% attack. Someone that can perform such an attack on the biggest network can basically replicate the attack on every other cryptocurrencies and take them all down. The main "protection" we have against that are concentrating the hashing power on less networks, and what I speculate would be the result of a successful Sybil attack -- namely, effectively a loss of confidence in the network and very sharp devaluation of the attacked cryptocurrency, which somewhat defeats ultimately the purpose of the attack in the first place.

Because the fees are huge when you aim to replace their existing currency with bitcoin. Might as well just get US dollars and not pay fees.

A database doesn't offer immutability guarantees. Also, you can't inject counterfeited data on a BlockChain, but could do it on a DB. There's a good number of legit reason to make their currency available electronically on a private BlockChain  (from the gov perspective). 
As far as economy goes, there's costs savings to start. And no counterfeit can be made. You can force banks in a country to give the option to anyone to convert their cash for the same amount in their electronic version of money. So like 1$ gives you 1 coin. You can avoid minting coins and let them last forever when they are electronic. Then since the banks offer the service, they already have your name/infos. This allows in turn to track money, which can be used to identify trends and help government spend money on things that the population cares about. Know exactly how much was spent on what, who overcharges, etc. Once you have this info, You can use it to police people because if someone wants to sell something illegal, you know who received the money. So you can break cartels. There's like so many things that the gov could do it's not even funny. I barely scratched the surface. It could be used to automatically file your taxes too actually.
It's low effort and a lot to be gained from their perspective.

If you narrowly meant PoW and just PoW, I'm just at a loss here why you would dismiss PoS as I consider it strictly superior (to PoW). Your next paragraph again only mentions PoW for a reason that confuses me.

A bubble is when you have an over valuation. This isn't the case, because even if you believe bitcoin isn't worthy of its current price, what it is worth as a service right now has real value. Even if you believe it should be worth 500$, a 6x over valuation is nowhere near bubble territory.
Bubbles typically happen when the base thing valued isn't really serving any purpose or has no value, such as beans babies or tulip bulbs. When they realized that what made some tulip bulbs super rare was just some common fungus, the price went back to nothing. Bitcoin has a real use, no matter what price it is at. It's got real value.

It's backed by a number of things.
-The network effect. Money is only worth something if the users agree that it does. Thus the more users end up inherently giving it value by virtue of there being many users.
-Consensus that wont be broken. The 21M coin guarantee having not been broken gives value to bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-13 09:28:48
Well, there wouldn't be miners really, they would just set the difficulty to zero. While you do raise a point that they could make fake entries since they control all the nodes, the people would notice since the data would not match from the last time it was downloaded. It would be immediately obvious because all the blocks would have a different hash since they need to point to the preceding block which itself had a different hash, etc.
Keep in mind, the only reason for them to control the nodes is to allow "zero" network fees on all transactions. It could also just be a private BlockChain in which only the gov is allowed to mine blocks. This way they wouldn't be able to modify the data as any citizen would have the possibility of being a node, but without any reward for doing so. The reward is you knowing data was not tempered I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:01:12

@_date: 2017-06-18 05:56:23
Lightning channels require funds to be there. If you had 1 BTC, then you can do as many transaction updates you want for "free" on that channel as long as you don't spend all of that 1 BTC. And you can't add funds to it either I believe. So that means payment hubs and the onion routing will have to find a way to effectively route payments while taking into account the amount remaining per channels, which is not going to known.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:22:04
Well, Bitcoin always was an experiment. From a technical perspective theses issues are fixable. I know, I code for a living. Maybe the miners win at stalemating things forever and bitcoin is abandoned.

No matter what happens, the tech exists, it's just a matter of aligning the common interests.

Oh definitely. I never agreed that encrypting the passphrase with the PIN did anything meaningful. But it wouldn't be hard to give the possibility of using a password instead of a PIN, and encrypt using the pin/password. You know, exactly like how iOS does it.

@_date: 2017-06-14 10:17:55
Well, the world is a big place. A lot of people heard of Bitcoin at some point in their life I would assume. But I doubt many heard of Ethereum or any other crypto. Say it takes 3 years for bitcoin to have 16MB blocks, SegWit, LN and sharding, it means bitcoin can be back at 1 penny tx fees (especially if there's PoS, but I don't think that's even in the cards at all). During all that time there's new wallets and services opening that accept bitcoin payments and we've had time to reduce friction. Once you have low friction and low operating costs to use, then the network effect can be huge. Keep in mind, even if Ethereum would get all of those within a year (extremely unlikely), its advantages wouldn't matter that much for direct payments because the people will opt for what they know, which is bitcoin. If it works well enough and serves a need then people won't go out of their way to looks elsewhere. But right now it's like if all cryptos are searching for the next killer app. And as a coder I see everything that can be done with the BlockChain and I see so much potential for things like legal documents, voting systems, elections, betting, IoT, Open gov contracts, proofs of ownerships (housing, car, etc.), contract bidding, uncensorable blogging, internet renting, etc. But none of those sadly fit a vision where the everyday people would see a direct benefit. It's got a real value proposition with automated payments initiated by devices, but besides that I am a bit at a loss to think of something that can change everything. Bitcoin is a strong "brand" that people immediately recognize and can understand. That 3 years is peanuts when you think in terms of wide adoption.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:40:55
A private BlockChain means they can take care of the nodes themselves and thus put the transaction fees at zero. And you know, enforce regulations control over it by forcing every user to identify to make a transaction.

@_date: 2017-06-23 04:53:43
That's wrong. BlockChain is a lot larger than just Bitcoin and Ethereum. And all existing BlockChain technologies. You can easily duct-tape the tech in such a way that you have a non-identifiable rotating ID that you add to all your transactions that only the gov knows how to map this back to the originator. And for example make the banks be the only emitters of currency in their private chain (for example, you can exchange money from your bank account to electronic currency on their private BlockChain). The gov stands to save a ton of money and eliminate entire redundant departments. And avoid printing money. There's really a lot for them to gain that I'd argue it would be foolish to assume they aren't moving towards that. We probably won't like it as libertarians, but I see it as inevitable considering everything they stand to gain.

Censor-proof, temper-proof, counterfeit-proof and unlike anything else in computers, allows a "machine" to exchange something rather than just copy it. They understand that entire markets will be built around BlockChains so they need someone to coordinate the different teams so they can allow fiat-BlockChain frictionless transition. Which honestly would be the greatest push that could be done for all BlockChains. The sheer amount of things you can do with this combination is staggering. We're talking remaking entire industries. I posted many times about it this and every time I just get downvoted anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:07:45
It's not because a BlockChain isn't a ledger that it doesn't have tokens? That's the thing, BlockChain is a pretty wide definition if you consider it on a technical aspect (the way I do). I had not considered the conundrum you point out that seems on the surface correct (a really generic BlockChain for storing huge amounts of data with no economic backing of its contents). I have a feeling that it can be fixed though, I just never went through and thought of that specific scenario. Indeed, PoW forces money on transactions even if the tokens themselves do not represent currency, so I totally agree with you there. It aligns the incentives with money to achieve consensus amongst users of the BlockChain. But wouldn't you agree that there are many ways to force an economic alignment between users? You could probably stake things that are external to the BlockChain, something that ultimately costs you money to make (debatably here: external tokens). This would probably require many more BlockChains and them being a de-facto standard to even consider this possibility unfortunately. Yeah at this point PoS+external tokens might be impractical in terms of everything being compartmentalized. I mean I could definitely see that scheme popping up in the future though! But I do readily agree with you that for non-ledger BlockChains maybe we ought to only consider PoW as an effective solution. I am sorry I brought up PoS as I had not considered that scenario.

All amounts are stored in a 64 bit integer on transactions. So without any changes, we can address to (2^ 63-1) 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 of the lowest denomination.
If you did try to add support for sub-Satoshi amounts, you would have to first fix the minimum Satoshi requirement recommended per byte. This is the real restriction, as most nodes or mining pool would immediately discard your transaction if that amount isn't changed accordingly.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:19:10
You're missing the point. Yeah, you could do everything BlockChain does as far as uniquely data storage is concerned with databases. The problem with having distributed databases would be that it doesn't offer an inherent guarantee of immutability. And that's the whole point. It's not that it couldn't be immutable before, it couldn't be guaranteed to be immutable. Speed is something many industries do not care about, and we already have that. Immutability and everyone verifying results though (no counterfeiting is a big deal) also means a lot.

I assume long term that bitcoin will copy the well working parts from other BlockChains and have both the network effect and tech good enough to cover most use cases. But that's at minimum in 2 years that that begins though. I think we will all win in the end. BlockChains allow a lot of domains to be completely changed, especially legal documents due to its immutability, but I fear that it will lead to govs using it to track payments. Some good and some bad, but that's many years ahead from now on.

Your investment should depends on your risk aversion, how much money you don't need and where you are in life. When I was in my 20s, I was going for high risk investments (which somehow gave the most negligible and stable returns over the years?). Today I have to put proportionally less high risk investments. But so far my "small" investment has given me more profit and much faster than years of shitty investments with puddly returns. So you take that as you will.

Because BlockChain data is censor-proof and temper-proof. You can't block it by a firewall. You can't prevent someone writing on it. You can't censor what's written there. You can't delete what's on it. Once written it cannot be modified.
It's the perfect combination for all legal documents. Also, it ensures a 100% uptime.

A database offers absolutely no *guarantees*. Which is exactly the whole point. If whatever system is used *cannot* have its data changed by design, then you don't have to worry about that possibility happening. I mean no offense but you ought to read about how BlockChains work. You can't modify old blocks, period. If you did, all the following blocks would not match their hash and will be immediately ignored. If databases could be used and were better at international money transfers, then it would have been made a long long time ago. But nobody did because it's just a bad idea.
