Ah, I see.  Thanks for the reply.

I'd like to use scan.co.uk at some point (they don't have anything I'd like to buy, at the moment).
However, it seems very difficult to actually buy coins at the rate that BitPay offer, so any purchase will involve a bit of a premium.

Yeah - that's the thing about OpenBazaar - you can sell what you want - 'cos who's gonna stop you?
They're implementing a number of ways to establish and trust identites, including Reputation Pledges (burning bitcoins) and Namecoin 'id' integratoin.
But you're right about it not being ready for that kind of thing (e.g. my post in is about a stuck transaction)

Thanks for this.  I just tried it, for Super Hexagon, and it works very well.  I like that you have a 'Linux' games category.
Last week, I ordered a Steam game from cjs-cdkeys.com.  I got the game eventually, but their method of [bitcoin acceptance] ( is much less impressive than yours.

When you start your own store, a public bitcoin address is created from your store id.  It doesn't create a private key.  In your settings, it shows you the address, and you can send bitcoin there.
When a customer connects to your store, they can see the bitcoin address, and see what you're sent there.
If you start a new store, you get a new bitcoin address.  Therefore, it's a disencentive against a 'start new store, scam someone, start new store' cycle.
I guess it's saying "We don't care what your identity is, we just care how committed you are to the identity you're created".
There's some more info [here](

Me too.  I was asking about here: 
It's possible that the 5 EUR charge is from a SEPA deposit being treated as a normal wire transfer.   That subreddit also has a few post stating that SEPA withdrawals are failing, so maybe the two are related, and their bank has some problem with SEPA.

Bah.  Nothing in Huddersfield.  Looks like I've have to keep getting stuff from evil Tesco :)  (via [crytpo de change](
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:21:35
I found a site today ([somethinggeeky]( that does geek stuff (mainly clothes, by the look of it).  They're UK-based, but ship worldwide.

Note: this is a crosspost from one made by a OB dev in There's not much more info in the [original]( but at least you know it's not this OP faking it.

Hi.  It was me that mentioned cryptodechange.  I got a downvote so I thought I'd done the wrong thing.  
I've used them for groceries once before, and am planning to use them again.  
PROS:  
* It means I'm spending the bitcoins I buy, rather than just hoarding them.
* It does actually work - I ordered on a Monday, and the lady from Tesco turned up on Tuesday at the requested time slot.
* You can enter your clubcard number
CONS:  
* It's a manual process.  You choose the things you want, and then the guy who runs the site enters them in a again at Tesco's site.  
As such, it will let you order things that aren't available at your local store.  The guy emailed me, suggesting a replacement, or to credit my account  
Also, it doesn't know how much delivery will be, so charges a standard £5.30.  My delivery turned out to be £3.50 (it probably depends on location and time).  The guy added some stuff to my order to make up the difference.
I don't think it picks up on Tesco's offers (two-for-one, etc). Although with the things he added to my order, the amount I paid the site, and the amount that went to Tesco was the same.  
So yeah, overall, it's not perfect, but I'd still recommend.  
(I also bought 3 steam games from them - you buy from there and then they get gifted to you)

Do Apple not have a stance against App Stores that compete with their own?  Do they still get their 30% from apps purchased through the Bit Store?  If they did, then it would keep them happy, I guess.  But if Bit Store ultimately became a popular way to install apps that used bitcoin to circumvent payments to Apple, wouldn't they just ban Bit Store?  
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:09:55
I've not, no.  I'm too awkward for that kind of thing.
@_date: 2015-07-21 06:34:33
I saw it, yeah.  My admittedly fudgey reasoning is that, in the Mr Robot universe, Tor exists, but drug marketplaces don't.  
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:35:12
Nope, it's on USA cable channel.
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:49:52
I really like Mr Robot too. I prefer it to Almost Human, which did mention bitcoin but it always sounded a bit crowbarred in.
I agree with what others have said - they may have decided that crypto and darknetmarkets don't exist in the Mr Robot universe as it would disrupt the plot - if Elliot could get morphine online, he wouldn't need Shayla and if he could get withdrawal meds he wouldn't have got addicted

Awesome, thanks for the link - I'm a big fan of digital currency for digital goods.  Website experience was seamless - the link automatically opened up electrum, which I wasn't expecting, 'cos I've never set it up.  I think Stripe integration is going to be really good for merchant adoption, at least, if it's really just the case of them ticking a box.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:57:53
Looks like it.  It was definately there yesterday, but now it's gone again.
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:46:39
I just tried to buy Race the Sun (today's deal).  I pressed Pay with Card and chose bitcoin, sent the bitcoin off, and Stripe then redirected back to the Checkout page, with nothing to show that I've made payment, or with any game to download.  I don't know if it's waiting for confirmations, or something has gone wrong, or what.  The transaction is [here](  
EDIT: 3 hours and 16 confirmations later, and still nothing.  
EDIT 2: I contacted support.  They gave me the game, and are looking into what happened.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:18:51
I donated bitcoin to download Elementary OS today.  I clicked the link generated by Stripe, and it automatically popped up asking with application to use, with Electrum being the default choice.  When I chose it, it came with the address and an amount already filled in.

When the money transfers services blocked exchanges, and OKpay updated their TOS to forbid cryptocurrency trading, people said it's because of pressure from their banks.  I guess it's no surprise that the banks are trying to stop their customers as well.
Although bitcoin represents a challenge to the banks, isn't the reason that they don't want you dealing with coinbase more mundane: i.e. that you're using a personal account for business transactions? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:38:48
The catch-22 is that it's almost impossible to get a business account for crytocurrency trading, because it falls into the 'money services' class of business - as these are classified as the most risky, banks are typically very reluctant to open new accounts for them.
