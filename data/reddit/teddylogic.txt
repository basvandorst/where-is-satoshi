I don't know, sd turnover a lot of money, and blockchain.info have a lot of users.  I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the revenue came from sd

They have links to satoshi dice, video poker, gyft and some trading platform I forget the name of in the wallet sections of the website.
I guess these are the sources of advertising revenue being refered to

If you have the wallet address, you can enter it into the search at Blockchain.info to see all transactions relating to that address.   
The field you're looking for is Final Balance for the current amount.

This is excellent.  Hopefully more e-tailers will start accepting BTC as a method of payment

You can buy full (direct ownership) and microshares (Passthrough) of ASICMiner through HavelockInvestments.
It's a pretty simple exchange interface with details of past dividends/prices etc.  I bought microshares of ASICMiner at 0.028 and sold at 0.044, which was a nice enough return not including the dividends.
There are several other mining startups on Havelock that may be worth researching, but as far as "safe" bets go, ASICminer is a good place to start.  
There are other ways of investing.  You could look at Coinlenders, where you can purchase Certificate of Deposits where your coins are held for a specified period for a set interest rate, or just put your coins into an account there and earn daily interest at a slightly lower rate.  There's no negative return except for the fact that you're allowing someone else to look after your coins, but the same goes for any investment.
There is also just-dice where you can allow them to use your coins as their bankroll, risking them against user bets.  You do risk losing some coins, but being a casino - chances are you will have some return.
Hope this helps!
