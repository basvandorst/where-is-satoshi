Meh, fuck the government

Coinbase is fine dont listen to them. I use that, binance, kraken, and coinmama so far
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:09:04
That's what they all say. Good luck with your 20 grand
@_date: 2019-11-27 02:37:00
Good call. I hope. Just decided to risk 6 figs at 7k. lets do this
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:40:37
Truth right here
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:25:30
Its gonna happen. No doubt about it now. Just wait
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:19:26
The daily price doesn't matter
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:02:45
Doubt we see it again
@_date: 2019-12-12 15:59:13
Oh give me a break every one wants to be rich and that's as close to freedom as you can get nowadays.  The more money you have the more free you are

Direct answer: I wouldnt be shit out of luck if I lost on it. I've already invested a decent amount in crypto of various types 90%BTC. I guess my vague question was more related to timing. It's the last amount of money I want to invest for a few years. I've never had the nerve to spend this much at once.
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:23:44
All valid points. All those boxes are checked. I guess I shouldn't try to wait out any lower price which is really what I was debating.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:37:33
That wouldn't feel very good lol, but I believe it will be more than double what it is today this time next year. So I guess it's a no brainer.  I know this seems like a silly question to someone with a 100k to burn but honestly I got really lucky the 1st go around and everything is different since then.

Been buying for years, only sold 3 times, and all I see is weak hands all over the place
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:58:14
Well, the retirement fund is under way. Happy to be here
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:55:24
From what I've seen over the last 10 years I think I'm just going all in while it's 4 figures and whatever happens
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:34:40
It's an open ended question for a reason. I've gotten here with a plan that is no longer relevant and I dont work in the crypto industry.  I'm just looking for conversations about buying strategies when its 5-8x what I originally bought.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:39:48
Probably exactly what I will do. I was just looking for a conversation about buying strategies for people with 6 figures to spend.
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:41:35
I'll start there. Dammit loch ness monsta
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:59:58
I'd rather work, but you gotta do what you gotta do
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:43:59
Actually, I do. That's 10% of what I'm willing to risk actually. I'm here for opinions and chose to be general. Thanks though ����
@_date: 2019-12-12 18:04:51
Yeah I don't work that way lol. I hope it does help a lot of people become free from some sort of control mechanism but honestly that has nothing to do with me
@_date: 2019-12-15 15:11:00
Never gonna happen
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:25:56
Quality answer. I was leaving it open ended for this reason. I could buy all 100k at 7xxx or DCA for a year or two

Freedom to me involves sex, motorcycles, and some connection to society though
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:38:40
Which ones do you think are worth a damn and why?  I'm only 5% Altcoins.
