**TLDR** — "People are quick to cast cryptocurrency markets as shady black boxes full of manipulation, bubbles that have nothing to do with facts, and the ability of small numbers of investors to move markets. What we found early this year is exactly what’s happened in the last day: it’s new information that moves the prices of cryptocurrencies."

I'm betting the value of "free Bitcoin-Cash" drops to $0 almost the instant it starts. Everybody is going to sell it for real BTC.

It's more like an impersonation of someone doing an impersonation of Morgan Freeman by someone who has never heard Morgan Freeman.
