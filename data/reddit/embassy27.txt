The whole point is that no one holds Pounds or any other currency. Not a single person thinks that’s a good idea. 
And even in international use, it’s far less volatile than cryptocurrencies. 
Take Blockshipping, for example. They had a great idea, launched it as an ICO, did well, then the crypto-crash came (or stabilisation, or dip, or whatever one would class it as), and now they are out looking to fund the rest with cold hard fiat. And it’s because Crypto proved far too volatile. 
If you were to go out and raise $50m for a company over 6 months, and you were successful, you would not suddenly be left with $20m in value. 
Crypto has its use in the near future, that’s 100% certain, in my opinion. I just don’t believe it will be a Fiat and evil bank killer, nor will it be a good way to store value.

It’s also worth less than half of what it was worth if you bought yours 9 months or so ago. 
The Pound is worth the same to British people, unless you go abroad in which case the devaluation is extremely negligible compared to the extreme fluctuations of any cryptocurrency. 
Cash has never been a good store of value, long term. Rich and wealthy people typically have very little cash compared to their net worth. It’s only for expenses and purchasing investments. The same goes for the middle class where the money is typically tied up in property and land, which throughout history has proven to be the best store of value. 
Right now, BTC has zero value, is not backed by anything and its future depends largely on very uncontrollable factors. As an investment, it’s incredibly risky as the imaginary value has a high chance of being wiped out. For as much as it’s interesting, ground breaking, intriguing and fascinating... it’s use as a store of value has yet to be tested. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 10:08:29
You make perfect sense. Most people on here just can’t see that BTC is currently mostly useless. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:28:33
Serious question tho... If it really is a threat to the banking system, what is to stop them buying up BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:24:58
6 years for it to be worth $10,000,000? No way. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:48:38
Do you honestly believe this?
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:08:07
Banks exist for a reason, and they always will. The currency may or may not change, but rest assured that banks will always exist.

What’s wrong with investing in Coca Cola?
It’s making his money work for him, betting on a relatively sure outcome, with reasonable long term expectations. And that’s quite frankly the opposite of what crypto investments are today. 
However much you and I love crypto, none of us have a clue about what’s going to happen. Bitcoin could become absolutely massive, but it could also become the Netscape of Crypto. All of the Cryptos we know today could be worthless in 5 years. They could also be worth a small fortune. 
What I can tell you for sure is that no one here will be netting a stable and predictable 6-10% return per annum. It will either be 1000-5000% at some point or it will be a big fat 100% loss. And that’s probably fine for the most of us who have invested money we can afford to lose. 
But Warren and the likes, are not playing the same game we are. The stakes are much much higher, and therefore it must be something tangible... Like Coca Cola. 
Look at it this way... He bought Coca Cola stocks for $1 billion in the 80’s (roughly $2.2 billion in today’s money). Last year it netted around $500 million in dividends, and the stock holdings are worth around $16 billion. Even if you adjust for inflation that’s 25% return per annum in dividends, while still keeping your holdings, which are also growing in value. Not bad for flogging sugar water. 
Bitcoin at this point certainly can’t give you anything like that. You can gamble on it mooning, but then you would have to sell it or spend it to realise your profit. Bitcoin doesn’t do dividends. 
Unless you get together with other people who have sizeable BTC holdings and start lending it out for a return... in which case you have just created a bank. 
Say what you want about Gates and Buffet, but they do have a point that should be considered. Dismissing them as stupid or “scared” is ignorant as hell. If they were threatened by Crypto, they would keep their mouth shut and just quietly stock up on it and emerge as Crypto overlords in a few years time. 
Between those two, they know far more about world finance and the application of  technology than all of us here combined. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:26:21
So... what’s the general consensus here... Is this solvable by people with a severe lack of blockchain/programming/mathematical knowledge?
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:17:20
I did not know that. 
Will this increase in the future? Because zero utility is quite accurate if not. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 10:14:26
This needs to be said more. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:47:59
I was thinking that too. 
Reading through some of the comments, I am getting the feeling that I could never even hope to work this out. 
Really cool, though. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:52:15
We are in the same boat. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 10:33:42
I believe in Bitcoin, and a few other coins. That being said, I don’t think anyone can truly say that it’s not a risky investment. 
I don’t know a great deal about Warren Buffet’s investment strategy, but I am quite sure that it’s based on seeing something that works. I.e. Coca Cola is sold everywhere in the world every single day, which in turn must mean that it’s a quite low risk long term investment. 
At the minute, most people that own Bitcoin wouldn’t dream of using it, so its purpose is purely speculation.
I also don’t believe that banks will go down. It’s just not going to happen, and if it did, they would just get replaced with Bitcoin banks. 
But I can see it becoming an alternate method of payment. The risk is whether that actually happens or not. And that risk is significantly higher than the risk of Coca Cola going bankrupt, for example. 
I think people are a bit too quick to call Buffet an old crusty white billionaire dude who knows nothing of the future. He will have taken extensive advisement on the matter, and decided that it’s not for him. I think he should perhaps just say that, rather all these negative comments... But that still doesn’t make him ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:49:18
I can’t say that I know what you’re talking about, but it sounds like the decent thing to do. 
I agree. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:08:40
I’d like to know about this too. I recently got into it and have been buying through Coinbase.

Ok, thank you. I’ll look into that.

Would you consider this the best place to buy and have my bitcoin and ethereum? 
Any help or comments would be much appreciated.

Move out then. Or declare your own republic, take arms and protect it. Make your own laws. You didn’t sign shit, so nothing is stopping you.

And no one is interested in your shitty attitude either, but here we are. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:09:07
Spain received an aid package from the EU after the world wide financial crisis hit. Catalunya were the biggest benefactors of said package. And they have always benefited. The economic superiority that they claim is not what they would lead you to believe.

Pay no mind to guys like that. You make a good point, but his head is too far up his own ass to see things for what they are. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:36:06
It needs to be a lot simpler to understand. Soft fork, hard fork, hash rate, Segwit this that and the other. If it’s to have any hope of becoming a useable currency, there needs to be a lot less confusion. 
Also, better denominations as the value goes up. It’s not practical to pay 0.000000016 or whatever for a coffee. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:30:41

Freedom from what? Have you ever been there?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:48:25
Are we talking about the same Catalunya? The one I know have their own government which enjoys one of the highest levels of autonomy in Spain, their own health care, their own police force, their own language, their own broadcasting company. 
Well, they used to until this morning anyway. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:54:00
EU will do just fine, should it come to that. Catalonia won’t. A Catalunyan Republic is a headache Catalunya doesn’t need or want. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:05:09
Sure, it works. But it’s nowhere near as fluid as people think. Micrometer is not something people would use. 
Ask someone how many millimetres 2.76km is, and it would take them a while to figure it out. Most would get there in the end, but it definitely wouldn’t be instant for the general metric using public. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:54:10
Megaeuros is a great term though lol. 
You are right on point. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:04:17
No, it really won’t. 
People don’t even understand credit cards, how are you expecting them to understand block chain technology, hard forks, millibits and Satoshis, and bla bla bla. 
I love bitcoin and all. I’m a believer in the idea. But it’s nowhere near close to being able to compete with fiat or banks. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:31:00
You could start by not being massively in debt to the country you are trying to break away from (hint: like Catalunya)
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:24:33
So effectively, now it works as an entry point for Catalunya and not mainland Europe... 
They can give them all the benefits they want. The goods would still need to cross into the EU. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:39:37
The referendum was definitely NOT binding. That was the entire point. 
They might as well have held a referendum on zero taxes, €10.000 a month in universal income and using unicorns for public transport. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:55:12
No, it really isn’t. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:26:53
So what about all the towns and communities that don’t want to be independent? Don’t forget that there are far more people that don’t want this than a lot of the left wing media wants to make people believe. It’s quite likely it could be a majority. 
The referendum that was held, might as well have been a Vote to give castles to every man woman and child. 
It has as much validity as me proclaiming to be the king of Ireland. 
The constitution is there to protect us all from the mess that would ensue if we could just walk around declaring shit with no legality behind it. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:37:50
This is the biggest misconception out there. It’s Catalunya that can’t afford to leave Spain and by doing so also leaving EU by default. 
If they were to magically leave tomorrow, then cargo would just go to Valencia where the ports operation would be expanded. Businesses that need to be within EU (90% of them) will relocate to Spain, as hundreds and hundreds have already done. 
The rest of Spain, which are the ones buying all their goods, won’t buy from them any more. 
Spain will survive. Catalunya won’t. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:40:10
Not for long. There’s a massive exodus of big business. And the ones who haven’t moved yet, will. They simply can’t afford to stay. 
Of course... this isn’t something Carles Pig Demon finds that important to discuss. Inane and pandering rhetoric is his game.

It’s upholding the law of the land. What part about this don’t people understand?!
Are you from the US? Imagine New York just declaring a republic tomorrow. 
Man, do I hate the way the media plays to their false victim hood. 
And what’s worse is that the majority of Catalans are now suffering because of these lunatics. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:50:40
So everyone in the US born after 1778 (or whenever it was) should have the right to completely disregard the constitution?
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:12:34
All they have done is divide their own people, turned the rest of Spain against them and driven a very large chunk of jobs and businesses outside Catalunya. They have split families and communities apart. 
Their whinging is an insult to the millions of people in the world who are actually oppressed. It’s an insult to the people who actually lived and suffered under Franco. 
Hypocrites is what these independista nutcases are. 
Carles Puigdemont will go down in history as the guy who single handedly set the entire region back by 40 years. He is a sensationalist liar pandering to the indoctrinated and clueless part of the Catalan population. 
Get off Buzzfeed and check some facts of what is actually going on.

Except there’s already something called 1 Satoshi. Which makes zero sense.

@_date: 2017-10-07 22:30:10
The “dude” has a point. Even more so with pointless attacks like yours. 
Bitcoin is very complex for a newcomer, and that’s it’s biggest hinderance in becoming a useable currency. 
You mention Segwit, hard fork, bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, etc etc to anyone not FULLY immersed into the world of Cryptocurrencies, and they just turn off. 
I see it as a major obstacle for Bitcoin. You can’t convince people of how awesome it is, when you can’t even explain how it actually works in a short sentence. Or the terrible denominations of a coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:49:29
This is just facepalm on so many levels. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:48:30
They could start by paying back all the money they owe the central government. Largest benefactors of EU aid packages in the whole of Spain, yet they somehow forgot that in their “we are oppressed” marches. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:47:34
There absolutely zero similarity between those two situations, and it’s quite frankly a massive insult to the people who were enslaved and oppressed.

The argument for using metric is strong, as it’s scaleable and already works. 
But, if it does end up being used on a large scale as a currency, it’s very impractical as you need to change the way people think of numbers. 
If it does succeed as a currency for everyday transactions, the price will be sky high, and 1 cBTC will be god knows how much. 
If the price goes up to let’s say $100,000 then a $10 coffee and a sandwich would be... what.., 1 microbit? What if the price falls 10%... Would it then be 9 Satoshis? (I don’t know what a Satoshi is, btw). 
This obviously just won’t work. If it’s ever to be used as a currency on a large scale it has to be simpler. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:45:49

So as a logistics manager... would you choose to import your goods into a country outside the EU, or inside the EU? 
And you better believe industries will move. Being outside the EU would create a massive headache for them, not to mention a lot of unnecessary expense. It would be cheaper to start moving their plants to Spain or France.

Movement of assets isn’t the real problem. The problem is that they will be outside of the EU. 99% of their cargo import will dry up over night. Banking? Good bye. Manufacturing will also go. Etc etc. 
They are so screwed and the independistas don’t even realise it yet. They are crying tears of joy on the streets like they just defeated Hitler (which is ironic, btw...)

1: Brexit hasn’t even happened yet. The UK is still in the EU. 
2: Politics has everything to do with it. Catalonia will have no trade tariffs with anyone and will be outside the EU, making Valencia an obvious and immediate choice. 
3: That would leave Catalunya just like most businesses would.
