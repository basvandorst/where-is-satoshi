Title | "Blockchain" or Bitcoin: Understanding the differences
Description | In this talk, Andreas explores the rise of the term "blockchain" as a counterweight to bitcoin. The term blockchain does not provide a definition, as it has been diluted to be meaningless. Saying "blockchain" simply invites questions, such as "what is the consensus algorithm". Meanwhile, bitcoin continues to offer an alternative to the traditional financial system. Andreas looks at the value of private ledgers, which he sees as having a small impact on finance, versus open, global and accessible...

Title | Bitcoin going to $3000 in 2017!
Description | We went to a hiking trip at 2000m altitude, exactly the same as BTC/USD exchange rate at $2000.   So we decide that we will do a 3000m hiking when BTC will reach $3000.   If you want that to happen you could donate some BTC satoshis to 1HodLwzbMspKfrNXNQKcoNbNLisZ3QwRuv if you want to be mentioned in our hiking videos we could do that to for a small amount of satoshis. Sorry for the wind sound but at 2000m is hard to keep up with Bitcoin :)

Description | Media that spy on and data-mine the public are capable of destroying humanity's most precious freedom: freedom of thought. Ensuring that media remain structured to support rather than suppress individual freedom and civic virtue requires us to achieve specific free technology and free culture goals.  Our existing achievements in these directions are under assault from companies trying to bottleneck human communications or own our common culture, and states eager to control their subjects' minds....
