Tell this to the people who lost their money from this Bitfinex hack.  Obviously you didn't, but there are many who did.  You failed to comprehend the point of this post.  They are getting what they deserve!  Lawsuits are coming.

Very simple:  Miners (fees).
@_date: 2016-04-17 04:26:22
No.  They will randomly close your account if you do not submit to all information about where your money came from and where you are sending your money.  Stay away if you value your (monetary) privacy.

You devs are killing bitcoin as you argue over this "block size limit".  Thanks!  
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:29:13
If they are in bed with the government and wall street, they are corrupt.  So, yes!

@_date: 2015-06-17 04:58:33
Litecoin up?
Bitcoin up?
@_date: 2015-06-03 03:47:21
Just leave them.  The next thing they will do is ask you your life story of how you made your hard earned money from when you were 10 years old before they lock down your account and never let you buy again.  Once again, just leave this corrupt and invasive company.
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:25:36
Aww, but you made me join reddit!  Thanks for the generosity!  I will pay it forward eventually.

"Once burned, twice shy."
I have no confidence in any exchange, especially BitStamp now!  Bitstamp fractional reserve open soon!  
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:52:32
Bitcoin usage goes UP.
Price goes DOWN!
Makes perfect sense to me.  /s
Have a feeling volatility is going to get crazy again soon.

Egg meet face.  Yep it's in the forefront alright!  Coinbase doesn't get it (bitcoin) even though they support it (for FIAT profits).  Bitcoin "remains very restrictive".  Good!  There's a reason for that.  Security!  And, then there is ETH...  DAO...Oops.  Fail.  I think Coinbase needs to drop support for Bitcoin and support monero or ripple or some other alt coin.  Coinbase looking pretty stupid right about now.  What else is new.

Such secretive, much private meeting.  
Glad YOU (chinese miners) have consensus!
Everything is peachy now...

Tea please!

I'm sorry but why are you defending Coinbase?  They are demanding MORE than banks!
So, you're saying if I just buy bitcoin and don't use as spending wallet I will be OK?  NO!  If you buy a large enough amount they will demand answers!  If you fail to answer AND provide proof or bank statements, stock sales, etc you're account is useless and you will never be able to buy or sell again.  
There are now more competition than ever for exchanges which is good for the consumer.  Bitcoin is worldwide, not U.S. based.  So, we have many choices.  U.S. laws cannot control bitcoin!  Thus the problem with U.S. companies as well as critics such as you thinking everything bitcoin MUST be KYC/AML compliant.  It doesn't have to be that way.  Business WILL go elsewhere (overseas).  This is what will happen.  NYC will be a prime example once they enact the BitLicense.  Business will go outside of NYC.
Circle is a good competitor.
Kraken is another...  
Gocelery is another...  
Bitfinex is another...
They don't HAVE to be U.S.-based like you infer.
Once again, fuck off coinbase for treating me like I am a criminal!

Why all of the love?
I love you too.  😉
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:49:00
Honestly, they are being dicks about it.  This reddit shows they have no clue what they are doing regarding making their customers happy (which they are not)!  Long-term customers are leaving for many reasons and AML/KYC is just one of them!  They aren't just asking simple AML/KYC questions.  They are DEMANDING answers as well as proof.  They don't trust anything you say.  Nice way to treat a customer!  Not only that, but asking where funds are going regularly as well.  Is this transaction going to an exchange?  Is this transaction going to your personal wallet?  Is this transaction going to your grandma?  Seriously it's getting bad!  Way, way, way too invasive in the last year.  So I will give another....Fuck off coinbase!!!  And, fuck the government you bow down to as well!   
There are plenty of other competitors! 
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:44:57
How about...  maybe you guys are pissing people off with all your AML/KYC bullshit!  Nah, couldn't be that!
@_date: 2015-04-15 05:13:36
Price... go up... please?  Pretty please?

Death to Ripple.

Wow!  Millions of satoshi's flying around.  
Will pay it forward.

It's a Rand Paul Bitcoin Tippin' Tuesday!

Hi. *Hi.* **Hi.**    
@_date: 2015-03-18 05:31:27
Thank you!  Thank you!!  Thank you!!
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:07:41
Frictionless?  HAHA...  You are being just as ignorant.  
Some of us care about our privacy.  Coinbase doesn't as they aren't just asking questions, but DEMANDING answers WITH PROOF if you are a high volume "customer" and you start fighting back!  This is the problem with regulating bitcoin the same as the U.S. dollar!  They are NOT a bank (but they are acting like one).  I don't need a freaking bank!  That's the beauty of bitcoin.  It is just as much the fault of Coinbase as it is the U.S. government, as it is you letting it happen.  We need to fight back!  Coinbase needs to fight back (ofc they won't though if it's about money).  Things need to change otherwise, bitcoin will not be in the U.S. as ALL bitcoin businesses will move overseas.  Think about that for a minute before you start railing on people who care about privacy.  Thanks.

Is it still Tuesday?  Still not at 1000?  
@_date: 2016-07-23 05:32:39
So, why don't you and the big corporations fight back?  That's right, it's about money and in their vested interest(s).  Nothing changes.  Great!
@_date: 2016-07-20 07:55:26
You call this fighting back?  You are defending Coinbase.  They are the victim?!? Then why aren't they fighting for the consumer instead of against?  The victim is not Coinbase, it is the consumer!
@_date: 2016-07-20 07:52:38
Did I say anywhere that I was gambling?  Nice assumption!
@_date: 2016-07-20 07:56:48
Agreed! +1
@_date: 2016-07-27 05:08:23
Agreed.  They would've been better off supporting Litecoin and confusing the customer.  HAHA  Way to stick your neck out on this other coin.
This should be ANOTHER warning to be careful with your coins at coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:38:27
Booyah!  Boomshakalaka?!  And, thanks!
@_date: 2016-07-17 05:47:35
I'm annoyed by all these defensive posts defending coinbase.  Coinbase is worse than most banks at tracking and invasion of privacy!  Asking me where I send my money!  Seriously, wtf does that have to do with anything but **me and the person I am sending it to**!?!  Don't come here telling us to fight back.  Why doesn't **coinbase** or perhaps...**you** fight back being in a higher position (especially ones in banking) than the "small fry" who has no power in society these days!  Just stop...! 
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:21:18
Much generosity!  
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:54:25
"...stop bullying the company"
Good one.  Coinbase is harassing it's users.  Please just stop blaming the user for everything!  This elite protectionism of these banks is getting old.    
Why doesn't COINBASE fight the good fight against big government?  Hmmm?  Oh that's right, they're doing a "quick money grab" and don't really care about it's users.
@_date: 2016-07-23 04:02:38
Once again... fuck coinbase!!!
