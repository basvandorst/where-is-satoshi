Yeah, the billionaire is an idiot. But anonymous child on the internet is a genius. ������
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:21:03
I also prefer a well working product. But that shouldn't mean that it's advertised as "ready to go" and then not work as promised 2 years later. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:49:37
Segwit testnet alpha of lightning and thunder was 'working' in 2014. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:29:29
You have to be some kind of special idiot to think that a company with between $2-$3 billion on hand in cash and another billion in crypto a month ago is now 'bankrupt'. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:44:39
Also: According to majority of core devs lightning didn't 'need' segwit. It just made it (and this is where you can start laughing) "much easier and faster to implement" ����
Paging and company. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:31:46
Ill believe that when I see it. We are already 4 years late counting from the first functional lightning 'show off' and it's entirely useless to normal users. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:12:45
Absolutely, great. I'm just saying that lightning has massively under delivered from day one so far. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:07:09
Those are seriously sad numbers for something that was advertised as "instant scaling" and now has process capacity of a hot dog stand 9 months later.

Why would you want to use a wallet who's developers spend more time whining and berating Twitter users than coding?
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:08:03
No. The advice if any is: Read up, get to know what you invest in, and believe in yourself. No matter the outcome you either make money and learn a lesson, or lose money and learn a lesson. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:56:27
Anyone who is devastated by the recent price development is simply learning the lesson every investor must learn at some point in their life. 
Know your limits. 
I learned this in the wild west of internet stocks in 1998-2002. This is no different. 
If you want to stay in, pick a few long term winners you believe in and hunker down for the long haul. If not, get out and never look back. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:45:43
Just visit their Twitter. Its not a one time event. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:18:23
Yeah, don't deal in shitcoin USD backed by hopes and dreams. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:15:28
I will believe that when I see it. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:29:58
Well, really only one. If you ever hit 100%+ take profits ensuring you stay in the black and gamble the rest. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:57:47
It was an absolute shit show with wild swings between euphoria and dismay. Ended up breaking even but learning lessons that we're absolute priceless and have served me exceptionally well in my adult life since. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:16:34
Obviously, it saved Bitfinex from bankruptcy so far by helping them pretend that they didn't steal $500+ million in BTC from their own customers. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:19:39
Yeah, nothing easier and better fitted for prime time than a system that can't handle more than a few hundred dollars in one transaction and require that you run your own node. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:13:15
Only a moron infers "no impact" without doing any research. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:19:41
Whining about other currencies 24/7 isn't healthy. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:24:14
Oh look, a market Oracle ����
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:20:22
If you can't figure out how to Google OTC markets or contact a few exchanges you have no business buying 500 BTC. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:27:00
Met a stripper in Austin in 2013 that got a 2300BTC lapdance tip in 2010-2011 and still held the paper wallet in a bank deposit box. Pretty sure she retired since. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:37:24
Not 100% sure but with what I had invested and the companies I had it in I don't think I would have beaten the market overall by much at least. 
Of course some got lucky, said fuckit and held Amazon for 20 years. But very very few. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:29:05
Far from. Google were small up against (and trying to sell to) Yahoo and Lycos etc. And it was years after they did their IPO. Microsoft was a bad choice and holding it since would have been a losing investment vs most. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:13:51
In my opinion they don't. They act like mentally unstable children. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:19:39
Hacking isn't the same as re-using the hardware. This entire premise is stupid. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:58:36
That's not a big miner. Not even remotely close. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:07:24
Shows that you don't understand that the authors are saying. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:51:27
Yes. If you are asking if this subreddit grew more due to the massive rise in price then yes. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:52:06
Just because you don't understand how something works doesn't make it bullshit. It just makes you less intelligent than you think. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:55:23
This was before the spike to $20k. I'd he didn't take profit enough to guarantee staying in the black at that point he is an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:58:12
That's not how any of this works. GPU will literally never ever be a way to mine Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:26:27
Retard strength is alive and well. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:27:58
Unless of course this is blatantly untrue. Which of course is the case. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:48:40
Absolutely nothing that indicates that 50% is a worst case scenario. With limited supply and high demand during volume rize a manipulation can easily gain high enough traction to spike. Entirely possible that the gain from $3500 or so was entirely based on tether printing and wash trading.  
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:57:16
If you are a BIG miner that needs to shutter at $5500 you don't deserve to mine to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:51:10
Ok. A big miner is far more than a few truck of equipment. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:06:58
Tether is a complete scam created to save Bitfinex from bankruptcy. Period
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:27:11
Either you are joking, or too dumb to understand what to search for. Nullc, Luke, and almost everyone else have been describing Lightning as 'just waiting for segwit' since 2015. And thunder and lightning projects described their testnets as fully functional for years. 
I'm not saying it won't be great in the future. Just that it's been a massive oversell with under delivery so far. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:42:52
1. That's not a joke that works if you write it out. 2. It's Far from awesome yet. Huge over promise with under delivery so far. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:54:36
'oh snap' what are you? 11 years old and sitting on a $90 fortune in Bitcoin? It's been a year since segwit and it's still near impossible to confidently send 5 BTC using the lightning network. Would you call that ready for use? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:07:11
It's bad because trading is virtually unregulated which allows derivative holders to legally run the market at almost zero risk. So yes. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:31:53
Still underwhelming for something that was described as "good to go" two years ago and is still in alpha as barely working sometimes. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:12:44
If you have been around longer than a year you should have no problem remembering about 100 comments arguing the 'immediate scaling' through lightning and Thunder that was discussed in 2015-2016. If not I simply don't care to argue with you. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:32:55
Because traditional markets have stricter rules regarding market manipulation. If you have large amounts of funds in Bitcoin you can use them to run the market legally and profit off your derivatives at leverage while risking a smaller amount pushing the market. In stock markets or traditional instruments this would be criminal.
