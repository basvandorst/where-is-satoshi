I remember when it went above 1k and bitcoinity automatically switched to showing price in mBTC (i.e. 1.000 instead of 1,000) and everyone had a heart attack when they first saw.

Bitcoin days destroyed for any given transaction is calculated by taking the number of Bitcoins in a transaction and multiplying it by the number of days it has been since those coins were last spent.

Traders dictate the short term price of these commodities, as you are seeing. Long term the fundamental value will show, but not in the near term. It's not realistic to think the technology will dictate the short term price swings.

There have been several posts by Satoshi's legitimate accounts in the past couple years, however lacked signature with using his pgp key. Thus, no one believes it.

In the traditional use of the word, it typically means shorter term (versus investor, which generally implies longer term). Sorry if that was confusing.

My vision of its success has it being similar to our current fiat situation; you carry a bit around in case you need it where cards aren't accepted. Though in the case of BTC, it would be for shopping online; everyone has some amount of it for e-commerce, since it's just way easier. I don't think it's realistic to think of it having the same market cap as the dollar, or becoming a world reserve currency.
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:26:51
There was a ton of info released in the past like 6 months. They aren't going to progress that quickly.

Doesn't matter about users on this subreddit. People here need to be reminded that it's under a $4b market cap; the smallest of a mid-cap stock. It doesn't take much to influence the price.

^ Well stated. People saying "omgz we'll hit taht in teh next week" needs to understand this. This is probably the most detailed fundamental analysis of BTC out there so far. They're not looking at Fib retracements and guessing where it'll be at. The estimates are probably conservative and the pricing timeline is arbitrary. BTC is largely in price discovery mode, and probably won't be moving as close to underlying fundamental factors as something more mature with transparent/established cash flows.

There were many people working on similar ideas around the time Satoshi posted about Bitcoin. Go read his original post; it was an idea similar to others that had been released around then, but was smoother around the edges and more comprehensive. "Similar architecture" is just way too broad of a reason to justify narrowing it down to one guy. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 17:33:23
link to article? only seen the recent $400 one (which seems to be very conservative and based on sound analysis, especially considering the fact that they're a Wall Street firm)

Nope, not yet. GBTC only, but that's backed by BTC.
