I am a bitcoin

Same. Im literally all my savings (as a poor college student, so over 500 but less then 2k :P) in at 4200. 
But I've been on this sub for a long time, and I made a few bucks at the beginning of 2017 from bitcoin. 
Just HODL! In a few years, we are going to chuckle at those buying in at 10k while it drops down to 8.5k. Just hang on.
Technically, yeah it would have been better to wait. It would have been smarter to buy in now. But you didn't. So just hodl down with me!

I'm 19, and I had 2btc when it was at 1000. Unfortunately I needed money for rent and tuition so I had to sell, but I'm still investing what I can and what I can lose.
