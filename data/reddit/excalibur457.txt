How would your bitcoin get “hacked”? Someone would need your private key (assuming you’re actually _using_ bitcoin as intended and not storing it in exchanges...)

Have you actually watched the movies? How deep does your ass go?

Neither is gold... things have value because we agree they do, not because of some magical property or backing. The only reason fiat has value is because we trust our governments.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:17:24
It wasn't an experiment if you really believed in it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:08:09
Do you actually know how bitcoin works? You can’t just go and print infinite bitcoin out of nothing. A finite amount of it will ever exist (21mil) and it is extremely energy intensive to mine. We’re at roughly 16mil right now and current estimates say that the last one will be mined in 2140. Plus tens of thousands of btc was lost when it first came out and roughly 2% of it is lost every year nowadays. It is rare by design. That’s why we call it digital gold.
E: Do you just spend all day making shit comments hunting for downvotes? Nothing on your profile even has a hint of positivity or legitimate contribution to any conversation you attempt to participate in. All you seem to do is antagonize people. That’s such a sad existence...
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:01:00


It’s not. Go watch the movie instead of pulling shit out of your ass.

No, sorry it won't. Please read in to Stellar Lumens and Ripple.

Or, you know, just sell when it hits psychologically significant numbers (10s, 5s, 2.5s) and right before contentious hard forks like what we're about to see, and buy right back in when you're comfortable with the dip. Works well.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:27:59
If it crosses $1T by this time next year I’ll eat a shoe. Quote me.

Nobody is treating Bitcoin as a currency anymore at this point, though. They're treating it as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:10:19
Excellent for consuming electricity and generating heat, though!
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:04:49
See there's your problem right there - selling is a no no.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:03:31
And these people won't go away until the bubble bursts. We have a long way to go before that happens.

Th-the timing is bad because bitcoin cash is already confusing noobies?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:58:29
For real. If you don't know what you're doing, only trade alts based on news/strong rumors. I've gone from losing 50%, to gaining 100%, back to losing 50%, to gaining 100% back trying to do otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:44:44
By volume that's not true. Bitfinex has higher BTC trading volume. They might be the largest in the US or handling the most legal work because of it, but they're not dealing with highest volume
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:55:52
Yeah, and then once the market consolidates and decides that s2x is a scam, and rejects it, it will recover from its dip and continue upward momentum. How hard is this to see? A pump and dump implies people will believe it to be overvalued at some point. Nobody realistically dumps Bitcoin to go back to fiat, because why would you do that? Who thinks that, long term? Plus the average small buyer doesn't even know what the fuck a hard fork is nor do they care. They're speculating.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:41:40
The system tells me they can't find me in the public record every time then kicks me out for a day when I try too many times, and support just gives me bogus tips for ensuring it works.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:18:40
Don't buy on coinbase. You can place orders on GDAX (same company that runs coinbase) for zero fees, whereas coinbase acts as a broker and therefore charges a fee per transaction and doesn't give you your coin instantly.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:32:04
I mean I'm definitely in the public record. I've looked my self up on several services already.

It's investing man. You've gotta be in it for the long haul - the market of the past few months is not normal by any means and now we're experiencing a crash. Only invest what you're willing to lose.
FWIW, I'd be ecstatic if it fell to $2.5k though lol. More cheap coins for me.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:30:10
Is there any way to protect ourselves against this?
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:47:49
I say it could dip to $0. Wheres my free ad revenue and reddit thread?
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:45:09
Which wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:15:37
It's a very volatile market. You just happened to buy during a peak. Now would be the time to buy. It always does this as its about to hit major milestones, too, fwiw. Did the same thing at $4k a few months ago and $3500 before that. If you sell now, you lose. My advice is to just stick it out unless you really need the money you invested.

K, but no one was talking about that ��

Too bad it's old news.

I wish I could use them, but they won't verify me. I've been dealing with their shitty customer support for like 3 weeks now.

Do you want the IRS up your ass? Because that's how you get the IRS up your ass.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:15:16
Yeah, they took my license no problem. Won't take my address/employer and won't let me do it some other way.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:16:33
Ha! He's probably just pissed she doesn't buy into the traditional market. He's just an old guy who refuses to change.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:47:26
How so?
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:15:34
Ok, but that doesn't change the fact that the banks and governments back the currency.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:53:21
Who did you end up going with?
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:59:41
I don't either, but you obviously see what the commenter above you is referring to.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:06:22
They're backed by the banks and government.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:44:48
I submitted this before all the other ones that got through ��
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:09:49
This applies to GDAX as well?

Most low effort shitpost I think I've ever seen on this sub.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:26:26
Most likely yes. The technology behind Bitcoin was revolutionary at the time but it's primitive compared to its modern counterparts.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:12:49
I honestly hope so. More cheap coin for me.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:18:48
It's gonna be like this until it becomes accepted as a standard currency in most places. Of course industry insiders are going to downplay it. It's going to put them out of a job someday.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:35:54
The point is that this isn't commonplace yet. It's good progress, but we're not there yet.
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:12:22
And you've never had problems transferring to the wallet from coinbase? I've heard mixed results cashing out from coinbase but nothing with BTC/ETH transfers.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:15:33
Ok, but that doesn't change the fact that the banks and governments back the currency.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:05:24
Literally ask anyone in crypto and they'll tell you the same thing: it's always been like this. People are betting on something with no intrinsic value (unlike stocks) and no realistic way to use in practical small transactions (like fiat). They're literally just betting that its value will go up, so of course it's volatile.
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:27:13
Looks like 4900 lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:08:35
I mean, it's going to go back up eventually. Just have to wait.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:07:17
RTFA, liar. It is not.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:35:12
*It's an older meme, sir, but it checks out*
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:26:49
They'll likely give in at the last minute because they won't make money mining a dead coin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:46:16
So basically, we're fucked?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:08:35
I mean, it's going to go back up eventually. Just have to wait.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:35:13
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:12:45
Sure, but that doesn't change the fact that it's backed.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:53:51
Could always pay sources in btc though.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:17:45
Goddamn whales. Where's my harpoon?
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:12:46
It seems they've reneged that statement with their most recent blog post.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:06:34
The truth is that mining isn't profitable anymore and hasn't realistically been on a small scale since like 2012. Next.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:05:34
Not sure if disingenuous or stupid. RTFA.




@_date: 2017-10-12 08:43:49
You don't have to buy at a fixed rate like on Coinbase and get a nice price chart visualizer if you want to see market trends.
Keep in mind that they're supporting the S2X hard-fork though, so you probably want to transfer your coins out of there a few days before the fork.
