Wow your site is incredible.

No I don't trust myself.  That's why I wrote down my BIP38 passphrase.
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:23:42
That doesn't mean that there is a problem with Bitcoin.  Gox is an example of how Bitcoin was used incorrectly.
Take email for example.  Email is a protocol.  A set of rules.  Lets say that an email provider (like gmail) accidentally exposed everyones personal emails to the world.  That doesn't mean that the email protocol is to blame.
Remember that Bitcoin is in its developmental stages.  The infrastructure (apps, wallets, exchanges, etc) is still in its infancy.  But, the beauty of Bitcoin is that the protocol has been studied and analyzed, and it works perfectly.  What is not yet perfect is *how* we use it.

A paper wallet. Try bitaddress.org.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:32:45
When did you create the wallet?  There have been several security breaches with Blockchain.info recently.  You may be one of the affected users if you created your wallet about a week or two ago.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:49:49
Just explain that: 
1. They will pay less fees than with credit cards
2. They will attract new customers who want to spend their bitcoin
3. They can convert directly to fiat when someone pays with bitcoin
4. There's nothing to lose
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:51:41
I believe wallets that were created recently are compromised.  
Honestly, discussing this is any further is kind of pointless.  You need to just see if bc.i will refund your money.  It's unfortunate that you didn't see all of the discussions that have been taking place here for the past two weeks, otherwise you probably would have stopped using them.

Feliz Navidad!
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:31:04
Presumably because of Bitcoin.  Which is why he posted it here.
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:21:18
You can use bitaddress.org (on an offline PC) to test your BIP38 encrypted key.
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:41:32
Quality marketing right there.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:50:48
In 5 years, I think there will be as many bitcoin users as there are facebook users today.
My modest estimate is $10,000.

Before you get into the Trezor, I recommend that you try cold storage paper wallets using a site like   This may help you understand the concept better, and you may even prefer this method over the Trezor.  You can download the website, then run it on an offline PC to generate your addresses.  Send a small amount of bitcoin to it, and try sweeping it back into your Coinbase wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:11:37
You do realize that Mt. Gox isn't Bitcoin, don't you? 
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:59:00
It was nice while it lasted.
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:48:54
I think the US would label it a currency, but the question I have is, would a country ever declare bitcoin a national currency?  What incentives would there be, and would it even be possible?
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:57:36
Bitcoin user for 2 years.

AND A HAPPY HANUKKAH TO YOU TOO  :P
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:23:34
If you didn't now by now, bc.i cannot be trusted.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:55:26
You make a good point.  For bitcoin to hit mainstream, you can't expect people to know how to put their coins in cold storage.  You have to put trust in hosted wallet sites like bc.i and coinbase, which ironically goes against the whole idea of being trustless and decentralized.
But, we are still in the early stages.  I expect significant advances and improvements to be made in the near future.  
In the meantime, if you are still looking at holding on to whatever amount of bitcoin you have left, look into cold storage paper wallets.  There really isn't any way for you to lose your money this way as long as you know what you're doing.

Prove it.

Read the community rules on the sidebar --&gt;
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:09:54
Yes that would work, but it doesn't offer much privacy because they can see how much you earn.
Stay away from blockchain.info though.  They have not proven to be very secure.  
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:21:48
bitcointalk.org is shit.  You should just stay here.
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:00:53
This is very hepful:

I just use a spreadsheet and it does the job.
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:04:10
Go to  and log in using your reddit account.
Go to the "My Money" menu.  Scroll down to "withdraw" and enter your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:48:56
Prefer circle's wallet in every way, except I trust Coinbase a little more.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:47:49
Old news like this SHOULD be upvoted for visibility to newcomers!

@_date: 2014-12-30 07:08:01
Yes, r/bitcoin is unprofessional because reddit is open to people of all ages.  You're never going to see professionalism here.
The gox problem was caused by Mark Karpeles.  Bitcoin is a *protocol* based on proven mathematics.  It has nothing to do with a private company's wrongdoings.
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:58:54
No processing fees or cash advance fees?

If PayPal is smart, they would buy Circle or Coinbase.

@_date: 2015-01-16 04:23:26
Dude, you need to smoke some weed or something.  Take a nice long walk.  And find something better to do than talk about Bitcoin on reddit 24/7.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:38:20
Unless you make a useful website, they really are not worth much.  You can probably get $20-30 for them if you find an interested buyer.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:54:30
I thought the stock market was closed today?
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:48:02
No, silly.  He got a boner.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:40:26
Wow, it turns out this is legit.  
If you haven't stopped using Blockchain.info by now, you're an idiot.
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:35:50
Then the person who spends bitcoin will want to replenish it, by buying more bitcoin (at least I do).  You can't ignore all of the other benefits of Bitcoin that make people want to have and use it.  
Bitcoin's convenience and security makes it an ideal way to be used as a transfer mechanism.  Even if merchants have no desire to keep the bitcoin, there are tremendous advantages for them to use it for business.  Corporations could use it to transfer money, saving them thousands in wire transfer fees. Small companies could pay invoices and salaries.  Volatility doesn't have to be part of the equation, because all of it can be handled by converting from dollars to bitcoin, then back to dollars instantly.
The amount of money the world spends in bank fees is appalling, and Bitcoin can return that money back into to the hands of the consumers.

He's being sarcastic.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:11:06
I'm not sure what you pasted above.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:31:15
Add it to the comments section using a blochchain.info wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:13:22
I was buying some bud the other day when I asked the budtender if they accepted bitcoin.  The dude asked if bitcoin was some kind of gift card...
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:59:55
So you're suggesting that Bitcoin not be traded on the open market?
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:35:52
Publish a link to the public address transaction details on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:06:44
Merchants that accept bitcoin can convert 100% to fiat instantly.  They end up paying less fees than credit cards.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:15:04
We will see who is the stupid one when he's locked up in jail.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:14:05
But he did have inside knowledge about bitstamp before they went down.
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:36:29
Why not make it a cool million bitcoin?

I love you
