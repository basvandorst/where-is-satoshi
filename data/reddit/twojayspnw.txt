A sale happened so it would probably be a taxable event but I'm no tax advisor so dyor

Then sideways or up?

Vote third party! We need a paradigm shift and the only way that happens is to get people to about other viewpoints and ideologies. We need to get a copy of the IRA playbook and use it to shift that paradigm the same way those asshats are.

True in most metro US cities too. I'm waiting until Nov 2020, which is only a US election, but will impact the whole world. If the sitting POTUS loses, a recession will most certainly occur.

You'd be missing all of the previous blocks hashes so you wouldn't be finding an valid solutions.

I left .5btc in my silk road wallet because it was worth 5 bucks.

Just started reading it a few days ago. Pretty good so far!

It may look appealing but can you get more than 12mb DSL out there in places like that? Probably need more bandwidth to work remote...

There will be gains in the future. The view I have is that these coins and tokens are like stocks 2.0. It's a stock that has utility.
I'm sure lots of people said the same thing about the traditional market.

That second thing is concerning.

Is this just a global price tracker?

Sounds like a fun gig. Good luck!

While not directly related to bitcoin, the zelcash project is launching a multicoin wallet named Zeltrez soon. Btc is among the coins it will hold when it launches. There is also a dex on the roadmap too.

CW? Who is that?

Nice try, Roger.

Is it? A years of gains wiped out?

Eh he's an agent for Russia. No use for anything good.

Putin and co are just working through the chapters of Dugins manifesto and it's probably easier than they ever imagined.
No doubt planting and propping up someone like Trump is all part of that plan to weaken the west. Itll be a fucking blast marching through the eventual shitstorm in the next few years.

And Reptards dont believe Russia is attacking the US via a disinformation and civil discourse campaign. Way to be a patriot.

Pretty sure those are PwC training courses.

Why is .co better for a tld?

That's my plan... but I'm hoping to hit Mars in 2020 not next year.

The more I read about it the more I'm convinced NS is SN.
