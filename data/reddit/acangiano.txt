Greed, for lack of a better word, is... common.

In fairness he is not cursing at the currency, he's (pointlessly) cursing at SR.

It's called arbitrage and it's a perfectly legitimate way of making money. You don't even have to switch from mtgox to bitcoinmarket. Just buy in BMUSD and sell in BMPP on bitcoinmarket. I would do it, but I can't because I'm in Canada.

Not to mention that Google will be likely to mark your site as malware.

You know what else is untaxable? Cash. I hate the FUD.

Thank you for doing what you do, Adam. I'm convinced MtGox is going to be a fundamental component to legitimize Bitcoin.

In the first bitcoin-related fatality, you would have died trying to push it past 200. ;-)

I'm afraid I got the last ones in Toronto. Check them out here:  and here: 
NCIX has them too, but they cost literally 80 bucks more.

In Canada, some CanadaComputers locations have them at $99. I almost got a couple myself, but I opted for 5850s instead.

Yes, I was referring to the conclusion.

PM me with your email address for an invite. I'm not sure how many I have at my disposal, but I see the option to create invitations and will do my best to invite you and others.

Yes, I had small volumes in mind. For larger volumes, you need to leverage mtgox.

127 coins for $13, I think. Live and learn.
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:11:48
I would not be surprised if BTC hits $1M in our lifetime. And yes, those 127 coins I sold would sting... a tiny bit. ;)

Yup. No real regrets. Happy to have been part of the early craziness, mining, etc. It would have been nicer to get rich off of it like many others have, but I'm just happy to have been involved.
