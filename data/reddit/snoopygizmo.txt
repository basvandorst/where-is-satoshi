I hope it is legit.  The software just views your trades , processes it and spits out a form, so I'm fine with that.  I found out about it from previous posts.

Windows 10 and Norton won't run electrum 3.0.4 --have the same issue-guess we just have to wait?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:33:17
Hilarious !

Definitely relatable- 
Sep15 th (china fud)dip ruined our anniversary 
Nov. 10th ( dimon and b cash)dip ruined wife's birthday 
Weird how those dips exactly fell on significant  days for me.
But from December into that Crash Tuesday in January - I stopped trying to sell hoping to buy more bitcoin at a lower price .
I am Just hodling because if you have a wife or girlfriend  who isn't supportive of the time  you focus on attempting to trade-  ( and you live in a small apt. Together on top of it )  , you'll make rash decisions which could end up mistakes -  especially when selling bitcoin

Thank you  for the reply.
When I use kleopatra to verify the signature - I change text file to all file - but that's where I get stuck and my computer won't let me get the lock icon - only the text ( even after it's deleted )

thank you for your advise.  I ended up being able to get it using:

Not sure if this will help- I had trouble with electrum using windows 7 and 8 . Maybe try downloading either   portable or the one above the windows install on electrum.org. ( there are three choices)

Saw the link posted earlier,

It happened last week - and when they came back - the price was significantly higher- just like it is as we speak - about $100+ higher then when they shut down - - 
Had to use Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:26:13
If you do a bank transfer , then you can do same day
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:23:55
Try Gemini and Coinbase -
They have pros and cons which you'll see.
Coinbase has high fees, but more accessible to buy btc, i feel. Credit card and bank account wth limits.
Gemini : if you don't bank transfer a large sum - you're relegated to $500 on margin every day at 5pm only m-fri.
Gemini prices do not charge hardly any fees .
@_date: 2018-10-06 01:29:28
So it seems - wonder when they took it down and when they’ll put it back up .
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:02:41
Same here!
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:19:13
That's exactly  what I was wondering - compromising the btc cash pre aug-1 btc if I ever go through the process of getting it out .
All right then - need to start getting off exchange 
Thanks people 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:46:03
With the max. $500 per day on margin -Gemini takes 4-5 business days to take from your bank account (to clear) for you to be able to have/move your btc 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:32:29
Something is up - wasn't allowed to withdraw last night and suspect that it will be the same tonight ( after 5pm and after 5 business days is there policy )

@_date: 2017-11-03 01:01:18
Sounds good..and that's what part of me wants to do.
You trust coinbase will split your coins up correctly and not f-ck with your BTC?  Are you going to put all your BTC on GDAX to get the B2X?
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:30:46
That sounds like similar to that Dutch family news report---sold all their possessions for btc to live in a tent and wait a few years for the price to moon.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:57:30
Sure ! You tell me the specs. 
For example - white t shirt / black ink ...
Size s, m, l, xl, xxl - 
Old navy tee unless you request American apparel 
- shipping by included if you're in the states 
Direct message for more details .
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:11:18
That's sounds like a good plan ,too.  just hold them offline and see where b2x goes --keep them and can always sell them down the road if you want. thanks
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:48:07
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:07:13
Yeah I may send a small amount  from electrum  to coinbase as an experiment -
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:46:03
- so You're not at all concerned about the hoopla over what coIn will be deemed BTC or any confusion having the wrong coin sold off . As I was saying - I'd be down for throwing all my btc on to gdax to get some b2x profit to get more btc - but guess people fear the potential confusion - thanks for the reply 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:03:21
Valid points!
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:47:25
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:35:03
mine are in electrum. Not panicked--just wondering  how many people are taking a risk leaving their btc on coinbase in order to sell b2x  shortly after to get more btc, which is what we all want
So you're keeping it off the exchange---thanks for the response.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:36:43
Gotcha - thanks !
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:46
Yes! You can receive a refund.  Just explain that you bought high and now it's low and you don't want it anymore.  You just need to show them the receipt.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:18:04
Need clarification please-
Are people going to send all their BTC on coinbase or GDAX in order to have an equal amount of BX2 conveniently  created?
Extracting BCH from BCH was time consuming for me, so I'm confused with the fact that coinbase will split B2X for us.
Thought we were never supposed to keep coins on exchanges.
Anyway-- is anybody planning to deposit their BTC on coinbase or GDAX to  get the B2X split?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:06:53
mBTC=millibitcoin=1 thousandth of a bitcoin=0.001BTC=0.00552 USD. uBTC=microbitcoin=1 millionth of a bitcoin=0.000001BTC=0.0000000552 USD. with a little asterisk on that. "0.00552 USD, at the current BTC/USD exchange rate of $5.52."

This happened to me . Got XEM  in early Sept.  watched it go down as BTC went up.  Had to sell at loss - lost 3 coins ��
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:12:17
The five minute 1800 dip occurred during panic sells pre- fork. I don't think it's hitting 3.  It's just consolidating now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:56:33
Same here - lost 3 coins - investing in XEM recently - tying to fantasize about increasing btc._=FAIL .    Lesson learned !
