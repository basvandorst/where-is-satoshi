The historical pattern shows Bitcoin prices booming one year after each previous halving
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:24:57
What does that mean for price?
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:49:38
Duh.  It's a commodity and an investment.  I would like to be able to make money with my coin.  The tech is fascinating as well.  I believe it's a viable digital option.  Just saying, shits boring.  It's BORING.

Thanks.  I love lagwagon.  Ive seen them twice about 20 years ago.  I remember them playing Sick live.  Good segway.  I got it at 3600 then sold it at that.  Rebought at 3900.  I missed out on on 2 profit opportunities.  I feel ok.  I actually felt it coming.  Not in one day.

Yeah but what is the future price of BTC ��
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:32:10
I know.  Wake up.  The banks aren't crashing and PayPal isn't buggy.  The true use of Bitcoin will be for the future (our children) and many global markets.  Screw fake news.  I have used Bitcoin as paymentl once.  Bitcoin is too unstable to be stable to use.  Lol.  Did I just say that.

Just get in and hold.  Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum are good ones too.  Dash is evolving, as well.
