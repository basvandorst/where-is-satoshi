I would add these double-checking steps:
3a. Use the Wallet Details feature to double-check that the private key(s) that you are saving yields the public key(s).
3b. Make sure the keys aren't already used by looking up the public key in a bitcoin explorer or adding them to a watch only wallet.
The keys produced are plaintext, so you don't need BitAddress to decrypt them in the future.  There have been analysis done of BitAddress and it appears to be trustworthy when it's used as you describe.

Shredding helps very little.  Always assume your online PC is compromised (virus scan is often useless).  Vanitygen should only be used on an offline computer, and private keys should be kept offline until they are used.  For just a few hundred dollars in coin, Armory may be overkill; you might try Electrum instead (it's more lightweight, faster, and imho it's easier to use).

They take your money, they control the private keys, and they give you no guarantee that they will be there tomorrow.  You get a shiny "coin" that can be lost or malfunction, has no backup, and that must be sent in to be redeemed for real BTC.  What could possibly go wrong?

A decent safe is theft and fire resistant, and it can (and should) be bolted down.  So no problem if I'm not home.  If I am home, the bad guys would need to get past two large dogs and a hail of gunfire first, so again no problem.

There's way too much wrong here.
1. no, use an offline computer (and always assume your online computer is compromised).
2. no, never connect your offline computer to the internet (use thumb drives to transfer).
3. dunno about mobile app security, but at this point I wouldn't follow any of toliro's instructions.
Virus scans are mostly useless and certainly can't be relied upon for security purposes.
And a paper wallet, when stored properly, is better off without encryption.  Encryption is for online storage of wallets.

Step 4a - go to Wallet Details in bitaddress.org (while offline) and enter your BIP38 encrypted key and passphrase.  Verify that it decodes correctly.
Step 4b - go to blockchain.info (online) and enter your public key.  There should be no transactions (an unused key).
Step 6 - now it's safe to move BTC to your new address.
Linux on a USB stick is more convenient than a throwaway computer, especially a Chromebook.  Much easier to get a nice print of your paper wallet that way.
For more wallet styles, bitcoinpaperwallet.com is another offline program that can print BIP38 encrypted paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-07-14 04:47:33
Enter the private key into bitaddress.org "wallet details" page and it will show you the correct public key.  I always do that before sending to a new address.  The other thing I do is watch the new address first, just in case it's already used (as unlikely as that is).

So far so good, and I monitor dozens of addresses.  All the addresses are the completely random type.

Actually the lesson is: When creating a new wallet and/or creating new keys, back it up BEFORE transferring BTC into it, not after.

Govt doesn't care if bitcoin is decentralized or not.  All they care about is regulating and taxing it.  And now NY is doing what's needed to accomplish that, which is to remove the animosity of ownership of bitcoin.  Because once you know who owns each bitcoin, all transactions can be tracked, taxed, and policed.
So what you should really be worried about is the govt adopting bitcoin [with ownership documentation requirements], and then outlawing cash.

The actual blockchain is a replicated database consisting of a bunch of files.  The format is inconvenient for searching, so an intermediate database is usually created for exploration purposes (this is what block explorers do for you).
Nodes replicate the database and forward transactions.  Miners assemble transactions into blocks that are added to the blockchain ledger.  Explorers extract, compile, and report information from the blockchain.

Good observation, and you are correct that the 12 word phrase is a seed for a repeatable series of addresses.  Electrum sniffs through a number of them, but sometimes it doesn't see all the addresses you are using.  So Electrum has a "gap limit" that you can adjust to make it see more of the addresses in the sequence.

It's not just 2-3 days.  I've seen Coinbase sit on a $10 (yes, only ten dollars) order for a week and then at the last second cancel it because it's "high risk".  However once you're on their whitelist it works pretty well.

Banks are not evil.  In fact I wish I'd kept my cash in the bank instead of buying btc last week.  The problem is if you keep an excessive amount of wealth in a bank, you become a target to be exploited by the government.  And the banks report so much info already it makes it easy.  But FINCIN is catching up, and the new reporting requirements means you can't hide a lot of wealth anywhere.  All you can do now is try to keep it out of reach.

Decrypt your bip38 so that it's in unencrypted wallet import format, then import it into multibit.  You are not moving the bitcoins, so change addresses are not involved.
Alternatively, you could send your bitcoin from your paper wallet address to a multibit address.  To avoid having change returned, you must send the entire balance in the paper wallet (minus the transaction fee).

You are correct, deterministic wallets carry a higher risk of seed hacking, but on the other hand they are easier to back up so they have a lower risk of accidental loss, plus they avoid the confusion and risk of fumbling a change address.  So you can decide what trade-off you want.
Electrum and Armory feature deterministic wallets, but the seed can be ignored if you use them in the most secure mode (offline signing) and supply your own bitcoin addresses.

SR1 is long gone and nobody got their money back.  They are paying back a hack that was against SR2.  Initially they thought it was a TM attack, but it turned out to be just a bug in the account balance refresh feature that someone figured out how to exploit.

So far, transaction malleability has turned out to be just a scapegoat and not the real problem.

Any action that exposes the private key, such as proof of control, pulls the btc out of cold storage.  So the btc would have to be recycled back into cold storage.  Normally not a problem, but potentially risky.
I was a little surprised at how easily Coinbase pulled a random cold stored shard of btc; I'd have hoped that their multi-key technology would make it take at least a little time to pull btc out of their cold storage locker.  If Coinbase can do it fast, then so can the thieves.

Note that the low probability of an address collision is predicated on the key generation being perfectly random.   However many random number generators are not that random.  And deterministic wallets intentionally use a pseudo-random number generator.  Because a deterministic wallet might be susceptible to having it's random generator sequence compromised, I would not put all my coin in one deterministic wallet.

Properly managed private keys appear to be safe.  I still worry a little bit about a key collision hitting one of my wallets though.

No, you want to make sure you have a backup BEFORE you use the key.
The Armory backup is for the deterministic wallet feature (the Armory-generated keys).  It doesn't back up your imported keys.
You are managing your own keys, and they don't change when you import them  into Armory.  So if you had them backed up before you imported them into Armory, you are good.
