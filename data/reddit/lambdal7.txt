Because SegWit is a drop in the ocean. Increases transaction volume that can be processed by 1.7 times. In a few months this volume has been reached again and transaction costs skyrocket again.

So much more transactions can the ligning network make compared to pre-lightning network.

If AOL invented the internet and weren't a company and were the first and currently biggest provider, yes.

Because it's possibly the most recolutionary technology of this decade that can be used for a whole lot of things  and possibly also currency.
Now, you need to take the value if it's gonna turn out to be the technology people expect (around $100 trillion) and mutiply it by the likelihood that it's all gonna fail, 50%, 30%, 20%, 5%, 0.5%? No one knows, but that's
how much it's worth.

Intrinsic value is the blockchain technology.

Yes, but the first and currently the most popular tech used on the blockchain is Bitcoin, it's the blockchain pioneer. It brings incredible marketing to the blockchain and sprouts new tech. That's why BTC is currently valuable, because of its reach and making the blockchain known.

The Chinese government can just control Bitmain however they like and perform a double spend.
They do that already, nothing happens in China without the governments control. If at any point, they decide they want to take Bitcoin down, they can do so with virtually no effort.

The factor is around 50x. $10B in inflow would yield a $500 mc.

Is this a bear?
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:09:03
China can make a big double spend at anytime since no major operation runs without their permission.
That’s the one thing that Bitcoin is supposed to be secure against.

It’s not a decentralized currency as 80% of its mining happens in one province in China.
Just because it’s not as centralized as the dollar soesn’t make directly decentralized, except you have a very low stanadard for decentralized.

So companies aren’t supposed to hse the blockchain? That’s the whole point of the blockchain that businesses, industries, elections are run on it
But if bitcoin doesn’t want to do that, then so be it.
@_date: 2019-12-26 10:16:49
You know that the whole point of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and decentralization is to protect against double spends, especially by governments, which Bitcoin is most vulnerable against.

How should I know, depends entirely on their current agenda. They can decide when they want to do it at will. 
Go Bitcoin.

Since when is Bitcoin a payment system for the rich and powerful? 
That’s the opposite of ideology behind it to battle exactly this corruption with banks and rich people.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:07:10
Yeah but once more and more companies do, then normal people can’t use it anymore, only the rich. Is this what Bitcoin is meant to be?
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:10:13
Only 1% of Bitcoin transactions are used for illegal transactions, so I don't think this is too big of an effect.

Why is it fucking hard. I'm a dev myself and have built systems like this, it doesn't look very complicated. 
If the founders have a significant amount of bch themselves, they sure have a few millions available to find developers that can do that. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:49:27
Can altcoins not simply also implement a layer2? It's not that hard is it? If you have a couple of developers they should be able to develop ist over a couple of weeks, or they can just "fork" it and make some modifications.
