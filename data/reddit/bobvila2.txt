Besides what others have pointed out about the tax year, any tax liability for you is non existent until you sell.

I think we’ll see a dip by late January/early February. It’s such a hot topic right now and so many new people are buying fueled by media interest. Besides all the usual suspects coming around we’re likely seeing millions of people’s parents, etc that all wanted to get in and had there kids show them how it works around Thanksgiving. With the price even higher and the media story even bigger i bet that will be magnified around Christmas and then it will take them 2-3 weeks to enter the market. After that I’d have to think we’ll start to run out of some gas in the short term but then again who knows. There are still so few people who own any BTC that it could go on a long time, i just worry about the Trump administration meddling when it’s so in the news.

Not a psychologist but in my opinion since it kissed 19k within that same timeframe that plays a part. 10k would have felt like a great price a year ago but suddenly seems low and one that we passed long ago. Everyone had nearly double 10k worth even if for only for a fleeting moment. Combine that with the media’s bubble talk and own self doubts about how maybe it isn’t worth anything and suddenly 19k which was what 2 weeks ago also seems like years ago and every day drags until the next wild ride up and to the right.

Well to be fair anyone violently rioting in the street against trump is at a far extreme end of the liberal spectrum. Just like how the extreme end of the conservative/trump supporter spectrum are literal wannabe nazis/Muslim haters/abortion doctor murderers, etc. I'd rather have a few idiots on the extreme end of what I agree with throwing bricks but to each is own.

An important piece of this besides the identification of the potential entity is the line drawn to Bitfinex. If large manipulation is taking place and it’s almost entirely based on that exchange (because that exchange is in some way complicit) and that exchange’s days are numbered the market is likely to become a bloodbath if they collapse. I don’t know enough about Bitfinex to opine on their long term prospects but this is an interesting perspective.
Article aside, I do believe well capitalized entities (independent traders and others working collectively) are probably manipulating  or at least trying their best to manipulate the price. There is just enough money on these exchanges to allow for certain traders to take advantage and make millions while staying mostly outside of government oversight.

What fundamentally changed between 12/20 when the price was $790 and 1/5 when the price was $1150? No one asks questions on the way up, only the way down. When an asset increases that much in such a short amount of time with no exact reason, down is almost always inevitable. When you combine an overbought asset with a potentially troubling situation (China currency investigation, huge market, could turn off all access to bitcoin) you get scared people and then you get selling. It will keep going down until the price is at a point where it's a no brainer and there are more buyers than sellers.

I worry about Donald Trump getting the idea that ISIS is moving money with Bitcoin. He will say anything to excite his base &amp; everything ISIS related is catnip.

I think the fundamental question around utility has less to do with transaction volume  than it does with transaction intention. 
If 98% of that volume is near term speculators with ultimate intention to convert some or all to local currency than it's still a house of cards and the utility question is up in the air. 
Then again, the quest for higher prices is in and of it self a utility and as long as there is no wide spread need to covert back to a more spendable currency and transaction volume is distributed somewhat evenly around the globe than it should continue to rise into the future. 
I am curious how it would handle a very turbulent economic time in the US, similar to 2008.  I think with a shit ton of volatility but likely end up back where it started after a while, like everything else.

If you tried to use it 12 hrs ago (when his comment was) when is when the vol had spiked the whole thing was gridlocked for 20-30 minutes. Very disappointing. 
They had to expect sooner than later price would break and vol would spike. The fact that they knew it would happen and still were unable to handle load suggests a hard systems problem. If they could have just added more servers to fix it they would have. Something must be bottle necking them that is either out of their control or buried in tech debt. This makes me worried for when this thing really starts moving south because that drop and vol was probably just a tremor.

It goes against the entire point of Bitcoin but mass market will never adopt local storage unless it's baked into iOS via Apple Pay (and backed up on iCloud so not cold storage) or an Android equivalent.
There are a lot of cool Bitcoin start ups but most are underfunded and because of that under staffed. Issues are almost guaranteed. It's about the same as bank robbers during the Wild West days. You could walk in, take the money by brute force and the bank is left pretty much saying "fuck, what do we do now?".

I own Bitcoin and have for years but just for sake of better understanding a bear case, would you say that below is within the realm of possibilities?
When the reward is cut in half the incentive for mining becomes less[0]. If you run a mining operation that is barley hanging on, it's fair to think you may shut down. If enough shut down that will both shift power to fewer miners and also increase transaction clearing time. Both of those things may decrease the usefulness of Bitcoin which would lead to media shit storm which would lead to a decrease in it's value.
[0]Assumes price will not double in short term. Most can argue the gain is mostly locked in as the price doubled since the media noticed this was approaching.

Coinbase is not at all reliable as a serious trading platform during heavy volume. They are funded by some of the strongest VCs in the valley, they really have no excuse. The company has been around for years now. Everyone knows the high volume was coming and the fact that every time it happens they basically go down points to a hard to fix systems problem.

I’d say his explanation is closer to where we are today. “Money” is a stretch considering it can’t be used to purchase much of anything besides more BTC or similar instruments.
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:53:32
I would not be surprised if it slowly deflates in the medium term as people that were speculating want their money back. But I also think it continues a slow rise upwards in the long term as more larger institutions continue to legitimize it's potential as a way to move money.
The likely next way we see massive gains is some kind of unexpected event that increases the utility of bitcoin. This halving is already priced in, if anything it's probably overbought.
