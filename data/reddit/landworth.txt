You totally want my penis.

Fuck your negativity. Eat bits! 100 bits

It's the idea that's spreading, not the money. Eventually people will use the system where they are buying someone a beer or a steam game. For now people are just generating buzz. I didn't know about the tipping system before yesterday, and a 20 bit tip got me stoked about the whole idea. I didn't know something like this even existed, and I think it is incredible. I give the shittiest server at a restaurant 15% of my tab and I am not even happy with them. It would be awesome to give someone online a little, even if I can't afford much. And then there is crowdfunding, if a group of people can donate fractions of a dollar towards someone's groceries for a week that can make a difference in someone's life.

It's really cool, and it's totally working! It brought me here

Thank you!!

You aren't some secret society who is fighting against societal norms. Nobody knows how to use this shit, that's all. The tips are a great way to raise awareness about a product and get people to try something new. It's like free samples at Costco, not like convincing people to attend a ritual sacrifice.

I don't get it... 
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:58:06
Thank god! Based on the other replies I thought I was crazy. 100 @_date: 2014-11-08 06:11:49
That makes me really sad that it has so much money then... A strip club would be a better use of money, at least then someone benefits. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:03:07
Please sir, can I have some bits?
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:04:25
Thanks! That's the most I've gotten so far!

He posts and people donate to him? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:43:44
Hahahaha thanks! You're awesome! 
@_date: 2014-11-08 08:45:23
Wow thanks!!
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:14:09
Meh, I don't need to delete it. If the highlight of his day is scamming someone out of a few cents I'm glad I could give him that.

I can confirm this! It brought me to signing up for my first wallet at coinbase.

I help kids with math all day and get paid less than a Macdonald's employee. People don't like useful, they like titties. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 07:54:35
Are you retarded? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:30:04
Thanks very much! You rock!
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:51:58
Oh wow thank you so much! This whole thing is just blowing my mind! You guys are incredibly generous!
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:07:40
Ok moneybags. It might not mean anything to you or the people on the top ten list, but it's more than I make in a week. It's depressing to see people flush it for kicks. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 05:45:27
Got some credit card numbers burning a hole in your notepad? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:49:51
Holy shit that is awesome!!! Thank you so much for the handy!
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:09:24
I have a feeling people are going to make a lot of money from tips. Start tipping on there and I'm sure it will catch on. I can just see the comment threads filled with people tipping girls who take their clothes off.

My $3 isn't going to matter if the value goes up. It would be better if that money went to a charity.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:52:32
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:29:49
Wow thanks!!! I love that you can type a food or beverage as a value, it's such a cool concept! I appreciate your generosity!
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:12:08
Holy shit thanks!! I'll be sure to pass it on!
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:58:58
Sounds fun:
