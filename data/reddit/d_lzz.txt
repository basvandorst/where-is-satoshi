It's always the same: the state declares that a group of people need protection, and the state will offer that protection. More state control, less power to the people, more power to the state!

I wish I had kept those Bitcoins in 2011 in stead of spending them on Silk Road. I would have been soooo fucking rich!

I think we need to do more than just wait.

Never let an occasion pass: blame North Korea and Russia.

I certainly have serious doubts about this government issued cryptocurrency, but I have even more doubts about the western press in which the Venezuelan Pedro is mostly vilified. One of the reasons this cryptocurrency was launched was to bypass US sanctions. The launch of this coin could be considered an act of resistance against these sanctions, against US (Western) financial hegemony. It's about liberating the flows of money. Perhaps the coin will be a failure, but I think it deserves some sympathy.

I invested more than I can afford to lose but I'm not panicking at all. Just a long sigh...

There are more than 2000 shitcoins in existence, what's so special about this one?

Zoom out! I really hope this is the end of the bear market, but it's too early to tell.

Those green candles are intoxicating.

Just a huge bear making a hiccup. But then again, everything is possible.

That's so kind. I probably am too late but your post cheered me up.

Why did I have to wake up in the middle of the night and turn on my computer? Red candles everywhere....
