Been investing for 40 years . There was fear in the market and the classis dead bounce was a signal.  It dropped further than I thought but I'm out now . I was a holder but the herd jumped in. When everyone is talking about it . contrarian strategy.  Stock market.property gold and bitcoin it's all the same when everyone jumps in you get out. This is not different people have been frightened.

I recently cashed in my isa with hargreaves and landsdown invest platform. Over £800,000 it was in cash within 1 hour and in my bank 3 days later. To many people are having trouble with withdrawals and the loss of bitcoin was the reason I got out of this a time back. It inefficient costly. It won't take over the worlid it will go pop

I did read 15 million but this can be multiple wallets etc. Bloomberg said 1000 people own 40% of bitcoin.
There are a lot of people with just  fraction of a coin.

Only 600,000 people in the world own 1 full bitcoin or more.
Over 15.000.000 own a fraction a big percentage of that is multiple accounts etc. A shallow market that the big guys in futures market will manipulate 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:02:47
These big players will move the market what ever way they want. Buy into bit coin big short it then dump. They did it with silver years ago .  And many other trades. They will love this it unregulated.

Been watching market closely recently. It seems to be getting manipulated a bit are the playing both markets bitcoin and futures.big money could be making decent profits on smallish movements.  Time will tell if it can break through these walls or they will get bigger ?

They new people are the ones that pushed the price up holders don't push the price. Without new players coming into the market this dies. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:11:14
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:01:47
More buyers are needed. More new people need to come into the market or it will level out  . Holding don't put the price up. Better start a recruitment push
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:43
It's crazy that's why it will fail to become mainstream

@_date: 2017-11-24 16:26:58
They are going too put a max of 5% portfolio into the market. The option market will be a bigger player in the future of the price. The big players fund mangers etc they get involved it will be for there benefit not the bitcoin small investors.  They are only interested in there profits. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:26:31
A etf would have to hold bitcoin as people in vest more money it would have to increase its holding. Same as a gold etf.
The in vestment trust you are talking about doesn't have to its designed to track bitcoin . But if you watch the price changes it doesn't do that . There has been a bit commented on it in financial papers etc. That's all I know about it my . It's avariable through some investment places like hargreaves and landsdown in the uk. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:20:09
Its greed the tech is great but this is a bubble. Been investing for 40 years there is no logic to this. I sold out at 7950. Was bit of fun but people are put to much into this.
Everyone can't become rich . Does everyone think that bitcoin will replace cash lol.
Govs and the financial system will not allow it .
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:56:00
I sold out i watch in amazement now. It's been fun.
It's got to expensive now for me the statements of $100,000. Etc was my Queen to get out. Looking like the .com bubble I got it off that 6 months from the top but I questioned my self then but gut feeling was correct same with bitcoin.
I might be wrong but it's been fun .
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:33:42
Bitcoin has become driven by emotion and greed. Great technology but we must be realistic will you pay 50000 or 1 million figures I've seen quoted. 
Everyone is going to get rich I don't think so.
More people everyday are getting into bitcoin but what I've seen they get frightened easy. With options available soon it will be open to manipulation. There are to many scams people loosing the holdings exchanges are far to numerous. 
Bitcoin or the Block chain tech is going to be here in future . But not 100000 dollar bit coin.
Be careful.  I held bit coin for 2 years now I watch out of interest. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:40:56
We all have to ask the question would I pay 10000 or 25000 or more for a bitcoin. It will only keep rising as long as thee are people willing to pay more ?
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:43:36
I did get out but watch out if interest .
The eratic swings in the market are making it a bit of a study 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:11:16
The down side is the market will be open to manipulation when big players start playing .
It's a great technology which will be used world wide buy everyone but I'm not sure the banks and governments will leave it alone. It under mines them . Blockchain tech is here to stay but not sure that crypto currency will remain indipendant. 
Only time will tell . 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:00:33
Greed is driving bitcoin that will be it's down fall. Everyone with bitcoin going to be rich ?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:44:19
Millions of dollars have been scamed like this plus mistakes in transactions.  Coins going missing.
I was in it for a bit got out now I just watch the madness.
Mt cox exchange collapse 2013 witted out millions.this is a unregulated market anything goes. Greed and the herd instinct is now high.
I'll be shouted down but 40 years in investment this was fun for a bit and I only played with money I could have lost.great technology but it's the wild west. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:04:36
Sp 500 is worth 15,900,450 million we have to remember when the big players start playing with options they have enough cash to move the market any way they want it cashed in at 7950. I want to see what happens they could destroy the party for there own gain pick up the pieces.  Block chain tech is here to stay. But don't think govs and the financial institutions will leave it as it is
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:47:59
Will something gold was found on the ground I lived and worked in western Australia where to this day gold can still be found on the ground a few years ago working in a old mininhs areas in wa is found a piece of just over 1 Oz.  I read some of the history of gold in Australia.  The kalgoorlie area was found buy paddy hannon and mates they picked  1000ozs of the ground in a mater of days. Lot of early finds in au were like this. Not a lot gold like that now lol. But thee are some luck people with modern detectors .
Secondly I must agree the present bitcoin market is looking like a bubble. Nearly 40 years of investing I've seen a lot. Great technology I did have a little for couple years but got out this year. Interesting to watch . I remember the dot com I cashed in far to early but it's a hard thing tof pick the peak. Greed and emotion is driving this and that is dangerous. I won't be popular but that's my gut feeling . 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:41:33
Have a look at the market depth at various x changes you can see when buyers or sellers are greater. I have been seeing a sell build up today on the usa and jpy markets which is the biggest (japan) it's finding it hard to break out. Nerves or fear. I got out last month I watch now through interest. Bitcoin is a shallow market where a lot of trades are small. Big players can move the market dramaticly.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:19:49
More buyers need converted to keep it going lot of small players in this.
Buy stocks you get dividends.
Buy bitcoin you get a exciting ride. But don't put you lot in
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:56:50
Yes  as long as new buyers keep joining in it will go up. But when buyers dry up then it's different.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:54:33
It won't 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:40:01
Big problem call scared but I got out at 7950.
There will be no rules as it's a unregulated asset. The market for bit coin on the trading platforms is shallow when compared to the world stock markets. The option available soon will be wide open to manipulation buy in for few million bet on a fall then dump make fortune.
Not allowed on the finance markets but this is unregulated.  
The bank and gov of the world will not allow this to take away there monopoly.  Sad but true. Block chain is a great step forward but I'm sure they will high jack it. Russia is talking of a national crypto currencie. 
I've been a stockmarket investor for 40 year got into bitcoin 2 years ago been a good run but I feel it has got to big and risen far to quick. Ask one question would I pay 20000 or 1 million for a asset that pays no dividend. I might be wrong but my gut feeling is I got out it far to volatile now . 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:49:23
This will be a problem when big holders try to get out the market . For every seller there has to be a buyer.  As long as there is more buyers than sellers thing will be good but when that reverses bang.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:46:44
The stock market will be around a long time after bitcoin is just another bit of history. Keep holding .
