Those are not hacks those are people being idiots and losing their devices or using wrong addresses. How are these examples or being upvoted?

Yea why did he just say "related" what a way to be as unclear as possible.

But you said you trust these institutions... I bet you think the NSA is concerned about your well being additionally?

You have to consider that there are people who still read the info and are are NOT subscribed. You are nitpicking at points that don't change the end result of what I am saying. I wasn't speaking about specifically when talking about political influence, I'm sure you knew that. Like I said, people don't critically analyze information, it doesn't mater if one source has high quality content or low if the info gets taken in the same. You failed to actually address any of the core arguments I made and are arguing for the sake of arguing.

Could you identify polices that the New York Times has influenced directly? I didn't say reddit was a political platform, I just said they have political influence, something inherent in the nature of any media distributor. This conversation is a joke, check yourself.

Still not true...

The point I'm making still stands true. Reddit has a lot more going on and a lot more traffic for things unrelated to "generic novelty posts" than people think. It's not some hidden unknown website. For example there is a substantial amount of political influence it has, for a website.

That was a great TED talk. I think my point stands though. These institutions distance people from the consequences they create, and the ones responsible for events which cause tangible damage to peoples life's are not held accountable. Consider that it's the nature of sociopaths to obtain positions of power.

Yes I agree gawker media isn't a great reliable source of fact. I just wanted to find something to share quickly since I have a busy night. I can't find the link now but there is a page on either reddit or blog.reddit that lists all the events reddit has started and or funded as a community. The total amount of $ and people involved on some things (of political nature) is larger than a lot of groups that participate in political activism specifically. From this link..


Any median that conveys political points of views or ideas, and especially one that organizes events with a political nature. That has a viewer/userbase of this size has political influence by nature. Reddit has a hivemind mentality and stuff that gets upvoted to the front page you can think of as the front page of a newspaper, the most people will read and see it. Do you not think if a major newspaper put on their front page something of political nature that it wouldn't have a political influence? Terrifyingly enough, most people do not think for themselves or analyze information well, so they can be easily swayed in this manner. Companies, and even politicians have hired PR firms that try to protect their interests online and this is not uncommon. 
Check out  for example. Reddit obviously has caught the attention of more than just a couple people into cat pictures.
I will add on to this. I just read this link today  and ill pull a quote out.

One could argue that it's just human nature and unchangeable. If that was the case then the institutions are a cancer themselves if they enable this behavior.

You may be right about the community. However Reddit isn't a small niche website with only cat pictures, although people like to claim that. It simply isn't the case anymore and hasn't been for a while. Check the alexa ranking to start.
