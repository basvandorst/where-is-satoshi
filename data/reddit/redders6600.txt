I enjoyed [this episode]( of the crypto cousins podcast - it's the real basics about trading charts, but I think Chris explains things in a really nice way and I found some of his explanation quite thought provoking despite the basic subject.
I've since listened to a couple of episodes of his own podcast [cryptoversity]( which is pretty good, although the _primary_ channel is youtube, so occasionally you find yourself wanting a visual.

If you're so sure of this pattern, use it to get rich.

Hard to say, but the crypto market as a whole is quite closely tied in sentiment so _I_ think most alts would see a big boost too, although probably less astronomical.
If bitcoin moons, it could be because of a new 'wave' of adoption for some reason, and I think bitcoin has the big advantage of a very well known brand. I can't imagine my mother in law purchasing some obscure utility token, for example, but maybe bitcoin eventually. Bitcoin is also easier to buy than most alts, which require purchasing bitcoin or one of the other 'big' coins first.
Whether to hold any more BTC obviously depends on your opinions and goals - my personal feeling is that alts are *much* higher risk/reward - much more likely to crash hard, but also more likely to 10x / 100x in a short time period.

That sucks, but unless you think the end is nigh, hold onto it for a day or so and you'll have made a couple of dollars.

Lazily worded, maybe, but pretty close. They are different products from the same company. If you want to buy bitcoin on gdax with fiat, you need to deposit your fiat with coinbase. This is where the majority of the issues/complaints arise, so if the concerns around coinbase are worrying the person asking the question then gdax isn't the answer.

I didn't suggest it was an easy change, nor that it would ever happen for certain... The point is if you want to use bitcoin to buy groceries we need much wider adoption. But the value of bitcoin doesn't depend on being able to buy bread with it.

Yep, interested to know what the answer is. I should think the answer is yes you can trade from Russia as if you're in the US.

If you have post only on You can't place an order that would be immediately filled (that would be a taker order and would incur the fee). So the price you were specifying must have been higher than the current price.
If you're trying to set up an order that will trigger as q price starts to rise, you are looking for a stop order. These always incur a fee AFAIK.

This assumes you value the product being bought in fiat. _If_ there is enough adoption that the merchant bought the product from their supplier with cryptocurrency, and enough other things can be bought with it, people will stop thinking of the price in USD or EUR or whatever. Cashing out fees are much higher than trading/transfer fees because fiat is involved, so this helps the fee problem too.
Whether or not the above will happen is one of the big questions, but there is also a common argument that bitco doesn't have to be used directly as a currency to be valuable, if enough people adopt it as a store of value.

I had assumed that you could trade in the region your ID has been verified in, and not on IP/geolocation. So if you used (for example) a UK passport to verify your identity when signing up, you'd be given access to the EUR &amp; GBP markets.

Gdax and coinbase are the same thing really.

Depends where you are.. [this link shows a country by country breakdown]( TL;DR: $531 (Venezuela) - $26k (South Korea).

I think the only limitation is that the order would be a maker order that gets added to the order book, rather than being immediately filled due to an existing order. As such, if the highest existing BUY order is $100, you can place sell orders for anything above $100. It's quite easy to accidentally go the wrong side of the price, for a limit order to work, the deal has to be *better* for you than the current price (i.e. higher if you're selling, or lower if you're buying).
