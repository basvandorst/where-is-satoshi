Aren't all of these crypto scares our of South Korea just stemming from one politician who has a popular petition to oust them?
I think this is 4 times this month that news from Korea tanked the market.

Facebook is broken at its core. It's the opposite of bitcoin in that it centralizes control and sells its users for money.
It would be interesting to see a decentralized social network, but it won't come from Facebook.
Facebook is to social media what Microsoft is to operating systems. Their sole purpose is to make you pay (or be sold) for something that exists in a better form for free.

This attempt at a rivalry is dumb. Invest the way you see best. This isn't a team sport.

Well played, dad. However, jokes on you. Defacing money is a felony and the cops are waiting outside.
Lesson learned, dad? Don't joke about my bitcoin.
Jk. That's pretty funny.

From what I read, the founders assumed it would be 'the first through the  door' and take the fall for other currencies to succeed.
I don't think there was much intention beyond just showing it can work.

No it isn't.

This guy sounds like a smug little prick whose gf left him for a guy who made bank on bitcoin.

That was such a piss poor article written like a valley girl who didn't get asked to the prom.
I was open to listening to the argument, but it is very poorly formed and just grabbing at straws.
I mean the original article, not this writeup.

Wasn't he for it after he was against it? Is he against it again?
Speaking of fraud, the compensation that these bankster CEOs are seeing who caused the crash is a crime against humanity.

There are no regulations to stop them, of course this is the logical outcome. This has always been my concern with crypto. The problem is that could slow adoption or even make new people just give up.
