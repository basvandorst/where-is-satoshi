Absolutely; I'm a moderately conservative Muslim and it confuses and upsets me when I see Islamic scholars condemn bitcoin without looking at its implications and benefits for the world over the fiat system we live in. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:37:51
It blows my mind, much of fiat currencies are based off of interest; this quality is completely against Islamic finance law. The Muslim world should be the first to support and back the Bitcoin initiative(or similar) from a religious standpoint but politics and greed...

This is my first blog on Bitcoin; it's meant for beginners and newbies to the tech and it's implications. 
Critical, honest feedback would be awesome; my apologies in advance if this isn't the right place to post this blog.

this should be the hot topic in r/bitcoin right now
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:16:48
I consider myself skeptical of cryptocurrencies but that was just straight up stupid haha 
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:16:53
But what gives it value exactly? It's the market's consensus; if the market doesn't see value in bitcoin, then bitcoin will plummet in adoption. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 06:11:04
I understand that, but at least with stocks, there's some form of backing, in this case a company with a profitable business model; no?
Bitcoin is a currency with no real backing, is there something I'm missing?
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:35:56
I actually agree with this comment,I doubt Japan is a cryptocurrency paradise being made out here, but as the video mentions, most people in Japan don't really use Bitcoin for payment.  
The fact that businesses are accepting this speculative digital mist is amazing, and progress can definitely be made over time with public adoption. Could Bitcoin evolve into a mainstream form of payment? I doubt so, but it's very interesting to watch, and hopefully it'll bring changes to finances. 
Btw, you sound like a total jerk chazzming.

I never called Bitcoin a scam; if I implied that, then I take it back. 
All I'm saying is that the value of bitcoin is very subjective, and it relies on the market the market to determine its price, and whether businesses choose to accept this currency. There's no one backing bitcoin like there is for the US Dollar. 
I like to compare gold to bitcoin, in that gold has very little use(10% of it in circulation is used for industry, isn't really backed by anyone, and the rest is lying around as jewelry or as an 'investment') but the reason it has value is because it's well established in the market for thousands of years.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:36:39
But what's propping the value of bitcoin exactly? Isn't the price of bitcoin reliant on the consensus of the free market? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:59:55
I'm surprised by the idiots trying to defend bitcoin over this. 
You can be very pro-bitcoin and still be against CP. 
I hope this issue spreads like wildfire amongst the bitcoin community so it can be addressed quickly without government getting their nose in it.
Immutability can be argued to be a double edged sword, but I refuse to believe that there's nothing that can be done to stop this

I would understand credit cards, but there's 0 sense to blocking from debit cards. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:43:28
That's a very thought provoking explanation; that makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:02:28
LOL, I am pro bitcoin; just look through my reddit profile. 
I'm anti CP, plain and simple. 
However, I read in other reddit comment that bitcoin blockchain does not actually contain the images, just links to them. Very big distinction. The bitcoin blockchain cannot be used to facilitate CP easily like suggested in the article. 
EDIT: I just skimmed through the comments and the study; images can be uploaded into the bitcoin blockchain.

The antibitcoin trolls(r/buttcoin) are having a field day. 
r/Bitcoin really needs to learn to moderate their opinion so they can appeal more people to Bitcoin.

If you do further research, you'll find that gold has very little use cases other than use in our electronics. This source might be 7 years old, but you'll also find big name investors like Warren Buffet who argue that gold has very little production value. 
My point is that many people bash bitcoin for being so environmentally destructive considering that it's really just speculative digital mist; I would argue that the same stands true for goldm considering that gold is tainted with far more environmental destruction, slavery, etc and we have little need for it other than in our electronics and some medical equipment, etc. 
10% of gold in circulation is actually used for production; the other 90%? Either as jewelry or as an 'investment' lying around in a vault. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:36:58
How so? 
10% of gold is used for anything useful(electronics, medical equipment, etc). The rest? It's lying around doing absolutely nothing; it relies on the market's perception that gold is a form of a safe haven. It's a form of delusion like bitcoin, except far more destructive and with a little used for actual production. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:53:47
LOL, I just finished typing up a comment on me using that xD
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:51:07
Haha, I see your point bro; I personally believe most of gold's price is speculative considering that most of the market views it as a safe haven. 
I didn't downvote you btw lol 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:19:50
Not really, if the miners ganged up then that would kill the value of Bitcoin and all their mining equipment would go to waste. They have every incentive to play by the rules; this isn't much different than people who accuse the dreaded top one percent for destroying the value of people's money, when in fact the powerful and wealthy have every incentive to protect the value of their money(USD, euro, etc). 
So yeah, I wish that miners would be a lot more distributed and decentralized, but they can't really control Bitcoin at whim like you're suggesting. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:34:39
It was more of to point out hypocrisy in people for bashing bitcoin because it's destructive, but gold is far worse, and is similarly also speculative(that's why you'll find warren buffet caution against gold). 
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:05:34
That disregards the fact that the USD is backed by one of the mightiest countries in the world. Bitcoin? Absolutely nothing. It's speculative digital mist that relies on the consensus of the market that it actually should serve as a means of trade.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:40:26
General users give value to Bitcoin; if there were many issues with it, the value of Bitcoin would drop and people would jump to other currencies that may not have those issues mentioned. 
And it assumes the Bitcoin protocol will never change, as mentioned before there many influential people concerned like Nick Szabo. There are measures that can be taken to promote decentralization, just let natural innovation and the free market address those issues. The lightning network will weaken the power of miners, the hash function can be changed, etc. 
Lol, whatever the miners do, they will be destroying the value of Bitcoin and all these expensive mining farms would go to waste. I'm not dodging your point that there is a very serious issue of centralization with Bitcoin right now, but it's not something that developers and enthusiasts don't know lol
 
And what's ironic is the fact that your scenarios seem to suggest that Bitcoin isn't going away; it really does appear to offend your world view that there's a group of people who want to create an e-cash that protects people's privacy, is borderless, makes finances neutral, enables transparency of transactions, guarantees near immutability of transaction history, security, automation and efficiency through smartcontracts, and so on. Color me crazy, but I find such a system to be intriguing, even though it's in a terrible state at the moment. 
And I noticed on your profile that you are part of the buttcoin subreddit; it's not worth arguing over this knowing your position quite clearly. 
Feel free to respond to this, I don't plan on responding back. 
Have a good one

I understand; off topic but related to what you said, check it curecoin, they piggyback Standford's folding protein project and they reward their own digital token, I forgot how it works, but I think you'd be interested.

Virtually every sub is like that
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:15:08
When I think of backing, I think of some monetary authority that I can somewhat trust.

I actually like to compare the value of bitcoin to gold. Gold has very little industrial use(about 10%), and most of it is being held as 'investment', so that just shows gold to be speculative with very little inherent value like bitcoin. The difference is one has been established for millenia while the other hasn't. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:01:02
Yes, there is an issue of some centralization with Bitcoin that needs to be addressed, and many members in the Bitcoin community are concerned with that and it's an issue that is being addressed. Centralization is a point of failure that needs to be done away with IMO. 
With that said, there's growing competition on making mining rigs(Samsung is reportedly entering the market), which should lower the barrier of entry, and there's also an increased number of miners moving to Canada and America as China is trying to kick out miners. 
With that said, in Bitcoin, the ones who have the most power in changing Bitcoin are the general users; you would be batsh*t insane to try to destroy an economic system that you yourself are heavily invested in-- that same argument can be paralleled with those who attack the federal reserve, forgetting they have have every incentive to keep the economy stable and going strong. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:53:14
That's a very valid point you made; I unintentionally used whataboutism, which discredits the issue at hand(the high energy consumption required for bitcoin's network). 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:06:21
You can't easily control Bitcoin, it's centralized but nowhere near as much as our banking system today.

I see your point, and I can't really argue against it; I think it's more subjective, because some don't see the need for a new currency that could fail at any point, and is draining our resources. 
I don't think it's a waste of resources compared to our banking system, but that's for a different discussion.. 
I just wanted to point out the hypocrisy that some people have towards bitcoin, while they're overlooking the crap in their garden. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:55:45
I appreciate his enthusiasm and I really want to see bitcoin succeed, but this seems too unrealistic and optimistic of a prediction....
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:27:06
About 10% of gold in circulation is used in industry, the rest is lying around as jewelry or as 'investment'.  
Gold's price is driven by speculation, that's why you'll find investors like Warren Buffet cautioning against gold being a form of investment, and considering how gold is tainted by slavery, death, and environmental destruction... I don't see why people bash bitcoin like they do with gold. The reason is gold has been established for thousands of years; we're less likely to question something that has been established.
