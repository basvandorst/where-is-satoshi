"That's the stuff that money cannot buy".
I call pure bullshit on this. If you don't have enough money to spend time with someone anywhere but in a fucking cardbox in bushes then it doesn't matter who you are with, it's fucking shit.
You can't learn for free unless you literally run through public libraries looking for information. What are you gonna tell me, that internet is free? Well what are you gonna use to connect to that free internet for free? Your fucking stone with a stick? Or a computer/phone you had to buy?
What about traveling? I can barely get to another town, explore the fucking world? With what money? Am I supposed to "explore it" on my feet?
All these fucking things is what money buys, if I had money oh believe me, I would for sure be exploring world right now and not arguing about nothing on a fucking reddit with my potato laptop.
Money can't fucking buy this my ass. Try getting food without any money, I dare you, you can't be fucking happy if you are starving or fucking dead.
People who fucking have money and can't even appreciate the fact that they have it and say that money doesn't fucking matter, even though they wouldn't really be as happy if they didn't have any piss me off more than anything else. It doesn't fucking matter how much money you have, there's never enough, because all excess can be put to charity and even if that won't make you as happy as being able to travel around the world and being secure for the rest of your life financially, it will make you feel just a little bit better that you help out those who weren't as lucky as you are, you fucking ungrateful piece of shit.

So, uhm, can I ask you what the fuck were you smoking?
I mean, how old are you? Haven't you learned that everything goes up and down? Just like your mother did on your father's dick and for what? Just to bear a disgrace like you?
