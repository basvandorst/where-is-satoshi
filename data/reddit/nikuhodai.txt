MtGox has not declared them as liabilities, plus their legal status is unknown. (The Japanese government has murmured about potentially classifying digital currencies as commodities, but unclear if that would apply to the current proceedings.)
In their filing they do mention the monetary worth of the lost BTC (valued at the last recorded goxcoin exchange rate), and even at that low valuation it is enough to by itself easily overshadow any other liabilities, yet they are not declared as such, and it's unclear if the Japanese court has accepted or will accept this reasoning.

In all likelihood a combination of factors. The relative dominance of MtGox enabled the Willy bot to have a bigger effect on the price than any such single actor could have today. At times Willy accounted for a sizable chunk of the total MtGox trading volume, and it would be impossible for this not to have driven the price up to some degree. (Likewise when Willy was switched into reverse and helped crash the MtGox price in early 2014.)
However, price markets have inertia and tend to normalize, and there were still other places providing liquidity and "real" prices. While Willy activity seems to line up fairly well to the early price increases during November 2013, later this correlation becomes weaker as the boom grows and takes on a life on its own. Additionally, Willy traded in an iceberg fashion, with caps on trade sizes and intervals, which is what you typically use when you want to _avoid_ moving the price; this largely kept it from participating in the very fastest price rushes, at least.
Would the boom have happened without Willy, and would it have gone as high? Who knows. The bot may have merely triggered and somewhat accelerated existing bullish sentiments, in other words the boom may well have happened anyway in some form.

Math is not lies, but your math is backwards (you calculated the number of transactions per fee dollar). It's okay, you made it clear you think the actual number is too high as well.
Perhaps a better starting point for a constructive discussion would be what you think *wouldn't* be a failure, and how that would work in practice? You may think everyone is just dismissing alternative ideas out of hand, but what if people *aren't* devils and things just aren't quite so simple as you think?
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:18:36
Sure, I can appreciate where you're coming from. For a global cash system, you absolutely need to be able to eventually handle several orders of magnitude more transactions than you can fit into a 1MB block (with or without SegWit), and for it to compete with current payment networks it also cannot have fees up in the dollar range or more.
The problem with the idea of achieving all that on the main chain is that it seems mathematically impossible, as a direct consequence of how Bitcoin inherently sacrifices almost all other priorities (like efficiency and scalability) in order to achieve its few core guarantees at great cost. Even *if* we could somehow stomach say a 4MB block size right now, the costs of that increase strains the system immensely and exponentially, weakening its core guarantees, and for all that still only buys us a very temporary reprieve, after which the next bump costs exponentially more while still being nowhere near competitive with other payment networks.
You might say that this means bitcoin can't work then, if it can't scale to handle demand. Yes, that's true, in the narrow sense that simply linearly scaling the base protocol can't work. For some reason some people have advanced the idea that second-layer solutions are bad and deviates from Bitcoin's vision, which is strange when this is the natural way to tackle scaling problems in any other facet of engineering or life. We shop at stores because everyone buying everything at the point of production wouldn't scale, we use public transport to reduce traffic congestion, internet traffic is routed rather than broadcast, and so on.
Politically, BU's approach of "ignore those evil Core developers, let's kick the can a bit further down the road" strikes me as about as disingenuous as "ignore those whiny environmentalists, let's burn more coal for now", and equally bad for long-term sustainability. Like you implied earlier, basic math and facts are not a matter of popular vote and we can't have something as critical as the main chain be governed by something as fickle as the majority's gut feelings.

This is an incomplete map I made a while back of some of the biggest bitcoin movements inside MtGox back in 2011, sounds like it may be somewhat relevant again: 
(red = identified as MtGox, gray = unknown, yellow = MtGox and behaves like a hot wallet address)
Sorry this doesn't trace further back than the 432K transaction itself, but it does shed a tiny bit of light on a things. The bitcoins were at least managed, being split up into chunks etc., then re-merged for the 424242 proof-of-holdings transaction, then split up again. I can't tell if those chunks were actually held in proper cold storage or something else, but it wasn't just randomly sitting around at least. (How's that for some small comfort, heh.)
The same graph also shows the source of the "found" 200K (on the far upper right) as being the last remnants of this old way of managing the bitcoin holdings, before possibly migrating to something else. (So far, this matches MtGox's official story of the 200K being found in an "old format" wallet.)

The Kraken site jumped the gun a bit, but yes this is basically correct. The trustee has reviewed about 8,000 out of about 25,000 claims total (about 10,000 of which were for BTC only, i.e. no fiat), presumably starting with the easy ones, and you should be able to check your claims account as soon as they get that site feature up and running. A vast majority of all claims so far seem to have been approved, but as I said I assume they started with the easy ones.
Note, crucially, that having your claim be reviewed and approved doesn't mean you're getting paid out anytime soon. Obviously they'll have to at the very least review all the claims before they can even begin to estimate a payout percentage.

I'd question any "linking" of these coins to anything, though. This address has never been spent so there's no blockchain activity to correlate, and the old theories that an owner would "tag" their addresses by sending small amounts to them is nonsensical. That kind of tagging is typically something done by other people, either to attract the attention of the owner and/or trick them into spending those coins, thereby creating more blockchain activity to follow.

1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF received the funds from an early major theft from MtGox (the hot wallet was cleaned out in early 2011). These are the 80k BTC referred to in [leaked emails]( between Mark Karpeles and Jed McCaleb.
It was never moved; possibly the thief lost the private keys, or felt the stash was too large to ever safely move on the blockchain, or possibly they're one of the most serious HODLers ever.

Quite a tortured nature metaphor there.
Emergent systems in nature are usually a result of millions of years of evolution with an unfathomable number of failed variations on the trash pile of extinction. Nature can afford to have 99.999% of attempts fail in the "throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks" game, but it's a very expensive and very risky game to play with an existing $20B market, and probably a very short one.
Furthermore, the by far most common natural order is cruel and vicious competition where only the strongest have a chance at survival, and strict top-down hierarchies based on domination, not spontaneously formed harmonious cooperatives.
Lastly, all the examples are species of critters who all have in common that they are small, essentially identical and individually very weak and vulnerable, hardly a fitting metaphor for the diverse Bitcoin space with actors of hugely varied power, influence and interests.
Want a more accurate metaphor for Emergent Consensus and the forces at play with the block size? Imagine if regulatory emission limits on carbon dioxide, heavy metals or hazardous chemicals were left entirely up to the heavy industry companies to work out between themselves. It's definitely in everyone's best long-term interests to preserve an environment capable of sustaining human life. Do you see any of the industry actors voting for tight emission limits?

Partially; all network participants (full nodes) validate the rules themselves and will reject any transaction which doesn't obey them. Miners additionally expend computing resources to make the historical list of transactions permanent (i.e. impossible for anyone to alter) by burying them under a lot of work that an attacker would have to exceed in order to alter the records. This is the "blockchain", and anything that goes into it becomes practically permanent after about an hour.
Miners (and only miners) get rewarded for this computational effort by collecting a fixed block reward plus transaction fees collected from every transaction they include in blocks, but the entire network is necessary to distribute the trust as much as possible (this is the "decentralization" part that everyone points out is important). For example, a dishonest miner who includes invalid transactions would not be able to spend their block reward, as everyone else on the network would reject that entire block of transactions as invalid.
The block reward is also what produces new bitcoins for use in the network, and it gets smaller and smaller over time on a schedule until 21 million coins have been "mined", at which point miners will only be compensated by transaction fees. The eventual economic viability of this "fee market" is still somewhat unknown, as are many other parts about the bitcoin technology -- it is an ongoing work in progress that requires occasional tuning and tweaking as we keep learning about it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:04:19


Well yes, obviously. Don't hold your breath waiting for them to realize, though.
Ironically BU seems to think the SegWit activation threshold only shows the "arrogance" of Core for thinking that 95% of ~~people~~ mining hashrate would agree with them, when in actuality it is the exact opposite of arrogance; the *safety of the network* is far more important than the prestige of having a particular solution be chosen.
Core: "If there is any contention regarding this change, we shouldn't do it"
BU: "We'll start the war as soon as we think we can win it"
I don't care much for making it about the people, but I know which *mentality* I prefer in Bitcoin's maintainers.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:13:45
Well, if we're talking hard forks there's technically nothing stopping you from completely redesigning the entire implementation of transactions and replacing current script-based transactions with some other approach where malleability is not an issue.
Is that practical, cleaner or less work? No, it'd just be a convoluted way of bootstrapping a new coin on top of the current bitcoin blockchain, and good luck *safely* forking that kind of change. But you could see where the idea is coming from; "with hard forks you can do anything".
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:48:27
To be clear, I'm not proposing we do it some other way; I think SegWit is a good advancement and a good tradeoff between the many priorities that need to be considered, certainly magnitudes better than the non-consideration we see in other proposals. It's also an incremental change, which I presume was intentional to minimize the risk, disruption and awkwardness of maintaining vastly different code for pre- and post-fork transactions. Even if you were to do it as a hard fork there would be compelling reasons not to stray too far from what has been proven to work.
If I were to hypothetically speak of an altcoin designed from scratch based on what we learned from Bitcoin? Not sure, and I'd be arrogant to presume to have a comprehensive answer ready on the spot. I think one thing Bitcoin has shown is that even with an open transaction model and theoretical script freedom, almost all transactions will be of a very simple standard form. In that case it makes sense to encode those as compactly as possible with their own malleability-proof representation and well-defined signatures rather than use scripts for everything, giving up some flexibility for efficiency, and let only those who need more expressive transactions pay the premium for the extra space required.
Such ideas are not new. Would such a slight improvement be worth hard forking the *existing* Bitcoin network? Not unless bundled with a lot of other useful changes to make the risk worth it, hence why I say the "hard forks can do anything" argument is relatively uncompelling, but you can see why people might be thinking otherwise.
I get that core developers must be tired of explaining the same thing over and over again, but we as a community need to keep explaining *why* certain ideas are wrong, or we feed into the whole "differing opinions are not listened to" narrative. Hence my recognition and fleshing out of the argument that was being made, hoping to stimulate a discussion along the lines of: "No, we do understand what you're arguing. Here's why you're still wrong." Thanks for contributing to that discussion.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:21:35
There's merit to that argument for sure, and it's how I wish things worked in a rational world. I fear we may already be past the point where coordinated forks are possible though. Are there fork-worthy changes so small and non-contentious that no one could find fault with them? The SegWit drama and related conspiracy theories would seem to suggest *anything* can be made contentious these days.
Here's to hoping I'm wrong though.

Stand by for an announcement.
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:54:55
It's the fundamental problem with digital money: whatever data you hold which lets you own and spend something, you will still have that same data after spending it, so what's to stop you from spending it again or as many times as you want? Every transaction will look just as authentic as the first one, unless you have some way to globally keep track of which things have already been spent.
Imagine if in the real world all you needed to do to spend a $100 bill was to *show* it to the store so they could see the serial number on it. You could run around and show the same serial number to five different stores and buy $500 worth of stuff, unless the stores have a way of realizing that you already showed the number to someone else previously. That's the double spend problem.
Traditional electronic payments never had this problem because the actual money is centrally controlled by your bank, whom both you and the store trust to behave correctly. Bitcoin removes the necessity for this blind trust, by instead having everyone jointly track, verify and record **all** transactions, and trusting the resulting network group effort.
If this sounds expensive and inefficient, that's because it is; and it has to be, as this is the source of Bitcoin's security. (You can still use Bitcoin without verifying everything, but then you are basically just enjoying a kind of herd immunity.)
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:13:22
I agree that in practice Bitcoin offers little to no realistic privacy guarantees, and given enough time and resources investigators can track down most of what you do.
It's not like this is some "flaw" of Bitcoin that's being exploited, but nor is it necessarily unavoidable. I just assume that even Satoshi had his limits and didn't have a good solution for all the problems the first practical cryptocurrency needed to solve *and* having perfect privacy, even if he wanted to.
Over time we'll most likely figure out ways to improve this with fewer trade-offs, with smarter transactions and smarter wallets, or new transaction types or layers altogether. As an analyst I'll be a little sad that day, but as an enthusiast I'll be excited. :)

Looking at responses and write-ups around the web, it seems this is the cherry-picked quote that got people going:


Had I written this today and with the public in mind (this was originally written with just the official investigators in mind), I would probably have phrased it differently to be less inviting of overinterpretation. Flip it around and you get "there is a very _low_ probability this could have happened _without_ affecting the price [on MtGox]", which is in line with what I write in my previous comment and even today six months later I more or less stand by that sentiment. How important is that in the grander scheme of things? Probably not as important as some people think.
Note that in context:
* I was not claiming Willy was solely responsible or the driving force behind either the boom or the crash, beyond suspicions that it contributed to them.
* I was not claiming this was the only possible explanation; the very next line in the report is an alternative explanation.
* This is part of the background section, documenting existing knowledge and sentiment _before_ our actual detailed analysis, starting pretty much where the Willy Report ended with its very strong claims of insider price manipulation, which we proceed to question and tone down.
You can't perfectly preserve your intentions across multiple write-ups and people looking for quick summaries I guess (the ability to express yourself precisely is insignificant next to the power of soundbites), but I can respond here for now and attempt to clarify as needed. :)

I think whether the trades were legitimate and whether the USD spent on them ever even existed are slightly different questions on the same topic. The latter is somewhat more speculative, and as you say that's one of the open-ended notes we ended the preliminary report on last year. You'll find that both possible answers cast suspicions of wrongdoing, though.
The more general question of legitimacy is whether this much money could credibly have flowed into and through MtGox in this fashion without any wrongdoing anywhere, and I think the answer to that is 'no' for several reasons. Some of these were already touched upon in the Willy Report.
* A legitimate customer would have little need to spread their funds and bitcoin purchases out across multiple accounts. No one except MtGox staff would be able to see individual account activity.
* The log entries for Willy trades stand out uniquely in the leaked trade logs. Either there was something funny with how the accounts were set up, or the logs have been explicitly tampered with to modify entries for specifically these accounts.
* During November 2013, something like 100 million USD was injected into Willy accounts and spent to buy bitcoin. There should be no way for this kind of money to be deposited in this kind of timeframe into a handful of accounts without anyone raising an eyebrow with AML checks in place.
* Ever since June 2013, account verification was necessary in order to make fiat deposits at MtGox, yet here are a bunch of accounts, seemingly being created on the fly over time (as opposed to in bulk in advance), instantly able to receive large and conspicuous deposits.
While we can debate the value of every one of these points, I think it's reasonable to apply the principle of Occam's Razor and say that this activity being fraudulent was the more plausible interpretation and worth investigating more closely.
@_date: 2015-02-21 06:49:41
First there's the question of why even make multiple accounts instead of verifying one and then keep using it? Account verification was a hassle that took time, and not something you'd want to do over and over again. Also, as you can read in our report and the Willy Report, these accounts were active one by one like a big relay race, for only hours or at most a few days each, with each new account kicking in after the previous one ran out of funds, sometimes mere seconds after. That's not a lot of time to even file for verification, much less get it approved, and never mind the time it then takes to do a bank transfer.
In short, it's not impossible for them to have been verified (we've certainly seen fraudsters go to great lengths to cheat their way through AML checks), but it would have have been difficult.

Upvoted for a nice concise summary of the entire incident without any hyperbole.
But seriously, you guys do seem to often design for the best case while at times scoffing at and ignoring corner cases that "shouldn't" happen. In this case someone basically decided to rub your noses in it by lightly stress testing your deployment and triggering such a corner case.
This one had no serious effects and would be unlikely to be a problem on mainnet, but I hope the deeper lesson of the story isn't lost on you, as a big reason (rational) people poke fun at this incident is that they are concerned what *other* assumptions are being made with this hard fork that might similarly be broken in adversarial conditions. Sure, they'll probably work as expected, but would you get on a plane whose designer says he's 95% sure it shouldn't crash as long as the weather stays nice?
(Also, the recklessly irresponsible development practices we saw in projects like BU are still fresh in everyone's memory, probably coloring people's perception of SegWit2x.)

High praise, thank you :)
I think you explained it (and other things) quite well; we certainly didn't miss that. :) The reason we didn't bring it up in this report was simply one of space; we needed a self-contained, not too long report that we could present to officials and other parties as a means of introduction and basic demonstration of our abilities. We picked the behavior of Willy for this purpose.
On the other topics you raised, we have done the same analyses and agree on the technical assessments. (Especially that the scrubbing/obfuscation seems to have been done on the logs as opposed to any source data in the database.) We went a bit deeper too, but this too we left out of the report to keep it from becoming too long or too technical. Feel free to drop me a private message if you have the time to discuss some of this further, though.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:01:58
Heh, you seem really intent on finding something to disagree on. Relax a bit, or I'll start worrying about your blood pressure. :)
I only said that we can admit that with hard forks we can make a wider range of changes and tweak core parts of the protocol if desired, which is [not really a controversial statement](
Are slightly more compact transactions a huge improvement? No, it was just a casual example of something that's not really doable without a hard fork. Did I argue we should do any kind of hard fork right now? No, I stated the opposite several times, including that I believe SegWit is the best way forward at this point. There's no shortage of people who genuinely need to be convinced with these arguments, so don't waste them on a strawman of me.

It helps to have a bit more MtGox data than the public leaks, but yes, your point is well made. There will be people in various places each seeing a bit of suspicious behavior each, with the ultimate question being if and when the pieces of the puzzle finally come together. Often they eventually do, though the amount of legwork people have to put in varies greatly in each case.
Apologies, I was projecting my frustrations over stuff people tend to say on this topic onto your comment and I realize I came across as incredibly snarky.

Hi paleh0rse, thanks for your input. (I authored the recently released [WizSec report](
We tried to be very cautious in our assumptions and claims, preferring to speak in terms of possibilities and probabilities, but naturally a lot of readers are going to fill in the blanks and proceed to jump to their own conclusions (especially journalists looking for a headline). However, if you think we made flatly incorrect assumptions or conclusions back then, I'm all ears. Your Willy facts are slightly out of date in light of what we covered in our report, so perhaps you haven't had time to read it yet.
Getting the easy part out of the way first, I mostly agree with you; Willy didn't by itself drive the price to $1000 or down to $100, of course not. One only has to consider volume and other exchanges like China to realize this. To be precise though, the question to ask isn't so much "was Willy noticeably pushing the price up when it bought bitcoin?" but "how would the price have moved _without_ Willy in the same situation?".
However minor, Willy would have shifted the market sentiment slightly in favor of buying at all times, reinforcing buying pressure and weakening selling pressure on a small scale. This mostly psychological effect would quickly become insignificant in the face of larger price movements, but could certainly help keep the price somewhat inflated at all other times.
People also shouldn't assume Willy was _trying_ to affect the market price. Spreading out massive buy orders is a well-established tactic to _avoid_ affecting the price, trying to stay below the radar. Purely behaviorally speaking, Willy acted somewhat like a whale executing iceberg orders to accumulate hundreds of thousands of BTC. The problem and the reason Willy is significant is rather the distinctive signs uncovered that these were not _legitimate_ orders.
All that having been said, Willy was responsible for a sizable chunk of the market volume in the early parts of both its buying and selling runs (before it was overwhelmed); close to 20% of total MtGox BTC/USD volume in October 2013, if I remember correctly. No one would argue that you can slap an extra 20% worth of buy market orders on top of an existing market, no matter how spread out, without affecting the market price in any way.
There's more but I'll round off here. Everyone please keep an open mind when reading reports like ours or otherwise speculating about the MtGox case; quick and simple conclusions either way may feel satisfying but they're not too helpful if you want to get to the bottom of something.

Several good conclusions and correct guesses in there, but also some academic overconfidence like you say.
In our report, which they seem to comment on but don't cite explicitly (aww), we refrained from claiming sole causation between Willy and the price rush due to how the market still climbed a lot even when Willy wasn't active, making it hard to say how much of it was caused by other market factors.
These guys interpret the same data and see the same things we did, but go above and beyond with more rigorous analysis but also more far-reaching conclusions and speaking with a certainty I'm not sure is always warranted. Still lots of good work in this paper though, well worth the read.

You're not wrong and the legal system does catch a lot of bad guys (*eventually*), but as a reminder to everyone else: just because something is technically possible doesn't mean anyone will put in the time, effort and money to actually **do** it. There's no shortage of resident reddit armchair geniuses proclaiming how easy something is or what ought to have been done, but if *you* didn't do it, then why would anyone else have?
I mean alright, I suppose we could just set up a simple brute force machine learning cluster to generate reliable data from arbitrary blockchain transactions, cross-reference against all exchanges and all bank transactions and their KYC records, code up a Visual Basic GUI to trace their IP address and check the [evil bit]( of the suspects' internet traffic, and then just read the printout for the name and home address of any thieves. Beautiful!
Now that we have a working method to catch any bad guys provided we have unlimited resources, complete cooperation between all parties and perfect information on every human being on the planet... How do we extrapolate that to also work in case the blockchain analysis guys, the exchanges, the banks and the police are all in different non-overlapping circles of trust, with by default and by design little to no access to anyone else's information, you're one guy looking for needless in a haystack of millions and millions of transactions, and the bad guys are in a country whose government will tell you to go fuck yourself if you ask for help apprehending their citizens?

Actually, I stated four examples of things would to some degree require an explanation if the money was legit but not if the money was fake or illicit. In other words, the hypothesis of "the money was legit" is burdened with additional assumptions to account for these points (e.g. "AML checks must have been lazy" or "they must have had a shortcut for speedy account verification").
Selecting the hypothesis with the fewer assumptions as your working theory is pretty much a textbook example of Occam's Razor, but I didn't really come here to argue semantics, nor have I "leaped to any conclusions".
