Something is telling me this wall is coming down.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:22
There goes BTC. TO DAH MOON!
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:00:40
What's the hint? We are going to blast past that bitch.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:22:57
Buy the 17250 wall. Cause a sell off, prices fall from panic coins and bots. Rebuy $1500 cheaper. Profit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:23:37
Heavy market manipulation right now. These 130 BTC sell walls popping in and out of the orderbook are hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:31:05
The Koreans are coming.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:59
RISE BABY RISSEEEEE
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:12:06
Dancing sperm whale blow off pattern confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:40:05
Right...as long as that number is over your physiological "oh shit" number :P
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:28:47
LOL. ON YOUR COMMAND!
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:59:29
Trading is has flat-lined. Boo.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:06:46
I've been trading the slow dip. But I stepped away for a second and miss my rebuy. Seeing resistance at the 14.5 mark we'll see if we get another big pump.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:28:31
Mating buffalo pattern confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:41:50
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:56:37
Anyone know what time this correction is supposed to happen at? I'd like to put it on my schedule. PLZKTHX.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:41:14
Buyer fatigue. 8am+ it will start to pick back up
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:07:33
Check out the whales trying to force the price down. Watch that 200+ BTC wall dance around on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:53:24
I'm a noob but buying low and selling high has made me a great deal of money my friend. :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:44:59
Sperm whale tale flap pattern identified. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:04:16
Fucking finally.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:34:20
That's why I mentioned it. Whoever it was was poping it in and out of the book at different intervals.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:50:38
If you really not planning on buying until the dip you can still make money on a bull run....
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:05
The lines go up and down and round and round we go.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:11:43
I'm right there with you!!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:28:49
Bitcoin Average has BTC @ 16.8k.... GDAX 17.5k??
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:05
LOL I said the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:43:28
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:56:25
Just dip baby dip!  
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:02:15
SHIT I MISSED THE DIP!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:13:15
What a fucking ride. This is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:30:39
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:25:47
Good luck spreading FUD. We can read your history :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:44:34
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:57
OH MY GAWD DUMP DUMP DUMP!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:32:32
It's never to late to invest in BTC. Do it now while you have the chance.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:39:24
It will return.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:30:34
The dippening! 
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:58:43
AWWW YIIIISSSSS!
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:45:28
Here comes a big dip. Extra avocado.
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:12:22
Damn, what a shame he is no longer with us.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:55:51
So true.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:12:11
dead cat :(
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:55:41
23k here we come.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:35:40
Bitcoin had died. Bitcoin had risen. Bitcoin will come again.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:35:39
Sell the news.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:15:31
WHAT THE FUCK
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:59:23
I think a lot of people are willing to easily dismiss what they don't understand.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:28:11
Blast off.
