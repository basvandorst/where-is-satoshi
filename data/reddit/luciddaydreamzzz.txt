Your question wasn’t irrelevant, you having a question just shows how hard such a complex topic is to simplify in basic terms. It’s not my complex economic model it’s just the one that is currently in use by most economies and I was neither defending or attacking it, just explaining it.
The gist of what I was saying is that you can both be a lender and a borrower. I can lend you $5 and you are in debt to me, and then I can go and borrow $5 from my friend and be in debt to him. If this happens 20 times, there is a total of $100 of debt even though no more than $5 was ever lender or borrowed, and you paying me back $5 starts a chain reaction that eventually pay off $100. You’re correct in that if you defaulted on your loan, $100 in total would be lost from implication, but that’s the risk inherent with investment.

Right, well the whole point of my initial comment was to explain where all the money is going, and your comment was telling me how the economic model is flawed, so it seems like you’re trying to argue with me over something we both agree on.

It’s an example I made up in 5 minutes on the shitter to simplify a complex topic mate it wasn’t made to be taken literally.

I loan you $5, you’re in debt to me $5, even if you currently have $1,000,000. The world doesn’t have negative money, just trillions in loans that are not yet fulfilled. Debt is a good thing to keep an economy growing, for example if your $1,000,000 was all tied up in a CD and untouchable and you really wanted an ice cream, you wouldn’t be able to buy it. But if I lend you the $5 today knowing you’ll pay me back $6 in the future (extra $1 as interest) we both mutually benefit.
