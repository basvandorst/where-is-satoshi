The timeline in the article is actually before the MtGox closure... At the time MtGox was around 90% of the exchange volume. Today there are no exchanges even close to their size, so even a big exchange like bitfinex closing wouldn't affect the market like MtGox shutting down and stealing everyone's money.

In the grand scheme of things, hardly anyone on Earth even knows how to use/own Bitcoin right now. I think the chances that demand for BTC shrinks in the future is pretty small.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:04:50
Easy on the personal attacks there dude. So you just take offense to me calling it a store of value? You'd rather me call it an investment? Quite frankly, you can call it whatever you want. It's still up 1000% since end of 2016. And if you're in Venezuela, where your currency is in constant free fall, crypto is most certainly a store of value. Don't get worked up over semantics my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:20:06
If the volatility of BTC makes you squeamish then it's probably better to stay away from crypto. I tend to think that since about 2% of the world (just a guess) has ever owned crypto and most major institutions and older wealth is sitting on the sidelines still, the market has quite a ways to go. I'll ride the waves.

You tax the fuck out of giant corporations that pay little to no taxes (see Amazon). Yang proposes a value added tax (VAT) of 10% to achieve this. Additionally, if you're already on social welfare then the value of that welfare will be subtracted from your $1000 per month.
Increased inflation results in a decrease of purchasing power, however an decrease in purchasing power (due to a new tax such as a VAT) does not increase inflation. Inflation is caused when money supply increases faster than economic growth.
Perhaps you can answer a question for me though... What do you propose we do to solve the problem of decreasing need for human labor due to automation?

Point is there are responsible ways to handle hacks, and there are irresponsible/manipulative ways to handle it. MtGox chose the latter. And the point remains, there's no exchanges that handle anywhere near the same percentage that MtGox was handling at their peak.

All that Bitcoin needs to be a good store of value is demand. It is finite, impossible to forge, and it takes work to create. Those are the same properties that give gold it's value.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:50:43
I had dismissed BTC as silly internet cash instead of researching it until I spoke to my friend shortly before my first purchase.  But you are correct, I didn't actually have a desire for a decentralized reserve currency prior to my purchase.  What I had prior to discovering BTC was a hatred of the FED and a belief that manipulation at the highest levels of our financial institutions have been the cause of most economic crises throughout time.  BTC was the answer to me.  And it still is the answer to me.

Except it doesn't. The majority of people who lost jobs to automation in Michigan have failed to pivot into new careers. Attempts by government to retrain these works have been largely unsuccessful. Instead, what is much more common is these workers will sign up for disability welfare and stay at home and meagerly scrape by.
Please take a moment to actually listen to [Andrew Yang]( and consider universal basic income and it's benefits to society.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:34:49
As a store of value alone BTC price can continue to rise for a long time. Who uses gold as a medium of exchange? Yet if Bitcoin were to have the same market cap as gold, it's value would be over $500,000 per coin right now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:21:07
What came first, the chicken or the egg? That's essentially what this boils down to. You won't see mass adoption of bitcoin until it is valued higher/less volatile, and we won't see stable high priced Bitcoin until we have mass adoption. There's no denying that the crypto industry is growing rapidly though, so to assume that it will remain this difficult to spend bitcoins forever is naive.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:08:32
It actually doesn't create bigger blocks, it removes part of the transaction data to allow for more transactions to fit in each block.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:53:51
All over the world. Try searching google, there are many news articles detailing how people do this.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:52:52
There are people who live exclusively on Bitcoin. There's certainly some hurdles for them. But the take home point is that, thanks to increased adoption and development, it gets easier and easier every year for people to do this. And in 5 years when we have active 2nd and 3rd layer scaling solutions, I'd wager that it will be more difficult/inconvenient/expensive to use fiat than crypto. Remember, we're still (developmentally speaking) at internet 1996-1997 levels. The potential of this technology won't be unleashed for several years.
@_date: 2018-09-25 22:34:26
It came off pretty hostile tbh. I only bother to tell you this because I think the crypto community has a pretty big problem when it comes to inclusiveness. You don't need to look any further than how women are treated in this space to see this issue. Keep supporting crypto, but don't forget that for this whole thing to succeed we need everyone on board.

Agreed, I can't see this translating into very much sales for Zynga (right away), but the exposure should be great for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-04 08:41:08
Doesn't matter.  This is about the exposure.  It should get mainstream media attention, and other mobile gaming companies could very likely follow in their footsteps.
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:28:30
That may be true, but it's also true that there are about ~411,000 people playing on zynga.com (at 1:26 AM PST, not less).  A lot of these people will be learning about Bitcoin for the first time very soon.
Regardless of Zynga's motivation, this is great news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-04 08:51:28
You are a good man to waste $2.61 for science.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:48:25
They won't, you are correct.
But whether or not people use Bitcoin on Zynga isn't incredibly important right now.  What is important is that 12 year old Timmy playing Farmville 2 asks his parents, "What is Bitcoin?".  His parents will  have most likely never heard of it.  Many of these parents will decide to read up on it.  Some of those parents will purchase Bitcoin for their kids once they realize what it is and how it works.
Additionally, mainstream media will cover this story, and it's very likely that other mobile gaming companies that accept credit card payments will follow Zynga's lead.
So while you are correct that this will translate into very little actual Bitcoin purchases on Zynga, that doesn't mean this is insignificant news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-04 08:29:18
To anyone who says that no bitcoin owners waste money on Zynga games, I say: Imagine all the thousands of people who are about to be exposed to bitcoin for the first time because of this.
I think this is huge news.

Yeah, it is.  I just finished explaining to a good friend right before I posted this that he can buy less than 1 bitcoin.  He has known about Bitcoin for years, but until now he had no idea there was an option of buying less than 1.
Switching to milliBits = wider adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:42:09
The name is more important.  When you don't know anyone who owns Bitcoin, and all you see on TV is that the price is $4,500 (up 85% this month), its very easy for a layman to assume that is the price you gotta pay if you wanna play.  I think you underestimate the number of people who think they've already been priced out of getting into Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-17 16:49:30
Who said anything about "the answer"?  I wouldn't argue that educating people about Bitcoin isn't more important, but what is the problem with adopting millibits?
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:09:30
Essentially it would reduce the amount of signature data that must be written onto the blockchain by allowing transactions with multiple senders to use 1 signature, rather than each needing their own signature as it is right now. It would make spamming the network more expensive/difficult as a result.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:07:46
What you're talking about is centralized currency. If you want that, you can readily earn/use it right now. It's called US Dollar.
Literally the only thing valuable about Bitcoin is it's decentralization. If you just want to manage account balances you can do so better with a traditional database.  A key element of being decentralized is not having any one leader, group, website, etc.

He's saying that buying $1 billion btc 4 years ago would be impossible to buy without dramatically increasing the price, meaning Yahoo wouldn't have gotten as much btc as you calculated. There's no way for sure to determine how much that would be.

How did you determine what software to run? I don't mean to say that all people will be able to learn by the same means, just that options to learn about how to use Bitcoin are numerous. The lack of an accepted central website will not stop the growth of Bitcoin.

The fixed supply and slow creation of bitcoin are quite literally the mechanisms that gives Bitcoin value. If you want a currency that is constantly being printed you can buy USD. If we just made more btc because more people want it then btc would but worthless.

Let's be honest here... The problem with banks is the fact that they can deny service to people, not that they use people's money while it's in the bank. The fact that they loan out money is the only reason bank services are as cheap as they are. I personally have nothing against this.
I do have a problem with the fact that many people in the world have zero access to legitimate banking due to their lack of identity/where they were born. And that's why we need Bitcoin. But that doesn't mean we need to topple banks. There will be many innocent, hard working people who will lose everything they worked their whole lives for if there was a major run on banks. When Bitcoin matures eventually banks will support it as a reserve, but it will always be your choice in the (crypto) future whether you want to use their services or not.

This is false. Yellow jackets absolutely are at odds with banks, which is precisely why they are advocating a run on banks.
You sound just like I did when I was a freshman in college... Prior to the invention of crypto, banks were more or less the only means of preserving wealth. In other words, if you had more than a few thousand dollars and you didn't want to have to worry about someone robbing it from you, you put that money in the bank. This is precisely why people born in third world countries without legally recognized state identity were doomed to a life of poverty. Even if they were able to save up some money, how can they be sure their neighbor doesn't rob them in their sleep? If you don't understand the value that strong banking can bring to a society, I suggest you travel around in some third world countries where the average citizen has no means of preserving wealth.
I agree that I have benefited from many revolutions in the past. Social revolution is absolutely a good thing. Perhaps what the yellow jackets are doing is also a good thing, but let's make something clear: a bank run is not a revolution. Look at past examples of bank runs in history and tell me what (if anything) they did to advance society.

The fact that you're getting down voted is pretty sad. It's one thing to want to support Bitcoin, it's something else entirely to support the upheaval of the entire banking system with little to no care for the *billions* of people who have built their lives on it.
Hate on banks all you want Bitcoin users; hell use crypto instead of fiat if you're that liberated. But anyone who supports a bank run knowing the consequences is simply inhumane. Think of the good willed elderly folk that have zero chance of comprehending/using crypto who would be direct casualties of the instability caused by a bank run.
This whole us vs. them game when it comes to banks is immature and petty. Grow up Bitcoin users. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it represents financial freedom for everyone who can't get access to banking. That doesn't mean we need to militantly destroy what the majority of the world currently uses to preserve wealth.

I encourage you to do your own research. Search YouTube for Andreas Antonopoulos. He's a programmer who has written books about Bitcoin, but these days he travels the world as a paid speaker discussing Bitcoin at different conferences and government organizations. He's got several great interviews with Joe Rogan, if you're a fan of his podcast I can't recommend those episodes enough.

I don't think you understand the benefits to blockchain technologies.  You realize that the centralized databases that banks already use are more energy efficient than a blockchain would be?  The main benefit of a blockchain is to create a trustless ledger that allows people who don't know each other to transact without any friction.  Banks are currently that friction; they are the middleman.  Any transaction goes through their personal ledgers and is confirmed by them before any funds are truly sent.  But blockchain technology will not allow banks to be more efficient.  The only way banks would be able to utilize blockchain for economic gain would be to premine their own crypto and somehow convince customers that their new JPChase Coin® should be valued.  People might fall for bank issued shit coins at the beginning, but eventually everyone will realize that premined centralized coins are crap, and no one will buy them anymore.  No bank will be able to compete with bitcoins dominance.

Ponzi schemes have one person (or a small group of people) at the top who control ALL the wealth. This is quite the opposite of Bitcoin. Bitcoin allows each of it's users to be their own bank. Meaning, my wealth is 100% liquid all of the time. I can spend it where ever, whenever and however I see fit. Unlike a Ponzi scheme that creates wealth through lies, Bitcoin creates wealth through supply and demand (like gold) and is backed by a global decentralized network that, at it's core, cannot be tampered with by any government or individual person. People are fond of calling Bitcoin digital gold. The beauty is that if you consider all the benefits of crypto currencies vs precious metals, it's fairly straightforward to make the argument that there is much more utility in the Bitcoin network than there is in gold.

Look at a graph of Bitcoin price history on a logarithmic scale and it should be fairly obvious. Ever wonder why it took 5 years to go from $0-$1000, but only 1 day last week to increase $1000 in price? The growth and adoption of Bitcoin increases exponentially, not linearly.

Research MTGOX. Money on an exchange isn't technically yours until you move it to a secure wallet whose keys you control. If coinbase were to get hacked tomorrow and have their reserves drained you wouldn't have any money had you kept it on there.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:38:19
You'd probably get USD in the amount equal to your portfolio value at the time of the hack. Coinbase is insured by the FDIC, but that only applies to your USD wallets anyways, but it's a very grey area when discussing what would happen to btc balances in case of a hack. Bottom line, control your own keys.

I think a better means of determining the upper bound potential for bitcoin (and other crypto currencies) is to compare their market cap to other asset market caps. Gold's market cap is 7 trillion. For bitcoins market cap to equal gold's market cap each bitcoin would cost $420,000.

That is correct.  It's also insignificant.
The last time we had $0.40 fees to send a Bitcoin transaction was in February 2017 when the price was about $1000.  In both cases (today vs. Feb. 2017) the real world usage of Bitcoin was practically nothing.  But we've been stable over $7000 for some time now with transactions fees comparable to when Bitcoin was around $1000.  That is significant.
