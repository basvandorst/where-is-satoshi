It’s too bad bc I’m sure Ross would have put that money to better use than the government.  He had a vision of ending the drug war which is by far one of the biggest travesties perpetuated by the US government.  My only hope is that one day people will realize that you cannot legislate morality and end this madness.

The roads?  Is it not impossible to conceive of a world in which the roads are built by private enterprise and not government?  What about school?  Electricity and water  are more often than not private enterprise.  If you love what your taxes go to so much nobody is stopping you from paying more.  I personally am tired of funding endless wars on drugs, terror, poverty etc etc.  how about all the tax dollars funding the NSA and CIA?  Warrantless surveillance?  Like I said.  You do you if you wanna pay more taxes then feel free but fuck the tax man, I’m not interested in contributing any more.

To say that would imply that you don’t believe in property rights.  If you own yourself then you also own the fruits of your labor and knowledge.  If you believe that you don’t own yourself then what makes you different than a slave or indentured servant?  The US was founded on the basis of individual liberty.  I’d rather keep what I earn.

That’s the keynesian economic theory,  classical economists would say that government interference in economics is a bad thing as well as the government debt. Especially in this time when government cannot control spending in any economic environment.

You’re clearly not going to get it... statist gonna state

I’m not sure why you’re getting downvoted so bad.  It’s pretty clear that turning on any mainstream news network you will get a heavy bias and agenda one way or the other.  Check out the books Stonewalled and “the art of the smear”,  Both by Sheryl Atkisson.   She gives a pretty insightful view on mainstream media in today’s environment.

Thats the problem with regulators is that they start small but no amount of regulation is enough

Got this text today and obviously super weary of opening links like this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:28:14
Well shit
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:47:36
That makes no sense.  When I get a pay stub it tells me how much I made then how much the government took from me after that.  Every year I work the first 4.5 months for free and not by choice... think about that that.  You can talk about what they do with tax dollars but the government sucks at managing your money.  No matter what it goes to it was still stolen from me to use it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:16:53
This seems like a good opportunity to fill a niche.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:38:52
So its legalized theft and because its the government doing it then its okay?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:07:14
Right because the government is a notoriously great steward of your money/s
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:45:04
You still didn't answer the question.  How is it not theft?
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:56:25
How is it not theft?  You have an entity that literally threatens your liberty if you do not pay. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:53:14
Let me redirect you to r/latestagecapitalism I think you lost your way.

Consenting to theft, no.  My other option is prison. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:02:18
And everything that you listed must be provided by the government?  Theres no way that an entrepreneur could come up with a product and charge the people who use it rather than the govt stealing from me and severely overpaying for whatever "service" it's providing?
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:48:05
If you love paying taxes so much just give them more from your check... go on, Ill wait

I am definitely interested I'd like to buy 1 BTC for kind of a trial purpose and if it works out buy 15-20 as an investment.  It would make me nervous putting that much money into this brand new concept (for me)
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:01:43
Sorry to be harsh but people like you lower the quality.  People come here to learn and get experience in the BTC community not get blasted for making a prediction that there is a short term price increase.  If im wrong ill eat crow, i dont care but is it completely unreasonable to expect a drop after a step rise? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:04:41
I know its not possible to double spend but how would i try to spend the same coins so that one of them cancels.  Also how do i add or not add a fee?
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:24:30
I dont get it??? How are you supposed to use this wallet if the private keys wont work?  By you i mean the owner.
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:04:21
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:04:06
Are there any apps for iOS?
@_date: 2013-08-23 19:32:44
It's a big gamble for me.  The fact that nearly everyone is against it pushed me to maybe do some more research
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:45:39
Thanks for your inputs thats why i posted here because this is still a new market for me.  The thought of buying small was something that i didn't consider much until now
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:27:51
Are you really mining .5 a day with it?
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:55:33
Right but how does the password interface with a wallet?  When i input private keys into blockchain.info i do not have the option to enter a passphrase
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:46:41
Yes, under the wallet details
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:40:31
Whats your problem? Im sharing my limited experience and my thoughts on the situation.  If you disagree thats fine but no reason to be a dick.
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:40:22
You assume Bitcoin will be around in 100 years.  Do you think 120 years ago people thought you would be able send "money" through a "computer" or video conference, or anything like that?  Electricity was a fairly new concept.  Bitcoin is a great advancement but at the end of the day it is currency mixed with technology and as technology advances so will money.  In 20 years many people will probably look back at mining and see it as archaic.
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:08:22
I guess I scare easy... I cancelled for the time being due to some opinions here. Gonna do more research thanks guys.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:49:29
I guess it worked it just took several hours.  When i did it before it was instant
@_date: 2013-08-19 11:42:56
So if i was interested in just investing a portion of BTC these paper copies would be more secure? 
Also is BTC setup where i could do P2P transactions in person? What would that look like... In theory?
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:25:25
I'm not actually doing the mining myself, I just bought a contract.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:05:12
I found a pack of black dog tags on amazon so i think ill try that out
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:55:32
Did you design that yourself?
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:51:44
Thanks for the heads up i was tryin to figure this out for a few days
