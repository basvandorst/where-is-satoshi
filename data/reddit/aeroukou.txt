Does someone mind setting up a torrent for this? The server seems dreadfully slow!
Also anyone got this to work on a Macbook Pro (late 2011 model here)?

Makes sense, thanks.

Yeah that would be great. Thanks.

I have used this with uBuntu before and it worked on my Late 2011 - 13" MacBook Pro

I have used coinjar a number of times, if you are transferring from NAB or uBank to coinjar via EFT it can actually be a quick process.
I can't comment on exchanging BTC for AUD though as I haven't tried it yet.
One thing to note, when I tried to get verified it took forever! But apparently they have a new system in place now.

I'm stuck at this step as well.

If you refresh the page a few times the majority of the time the javascript isn't included in the code, however every so often it appears, I'm not sure why.

Is no one concerned with Tether anymore? Particularly given the news about the euro tether details from today?

I'm trying to show both sides. So I should mention that the auditor provided a document in September saying that $400+ million was in banks and the auditor saw the statements. There are however a number of caveats to this.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:37:32
Fingers crossed this is the case.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:46:29
Hopefully it is FUD.

Sorry I should have posted originally.
This in itself is not huge in the scheme of things. It's more the original issue, is tether backed, if it is why are audit aren't available like the promised.
I hopefully there are legitimate delays in why we don't have audit information, but the longer and longer it takes for this to be available the more I question if it's not backed by anything.

I hope this is correct and it should be the case if Tether operates as it says it does and the document issued by the auditor in September supports this (up until that point) with many caveats.
However if, (I am not saying this is the case, only tether knows) tether is being created from nothing, then it would be propping up bitcoin. Once again, I hope it's not for my sake and everyone else.
