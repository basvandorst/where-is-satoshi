In Canada Quadriga offers wire transfers of up to 500k for 0 fees. So that 10x.

Hashing power increases with an increase in price. Hashing power is highly correlated with energy spent. If Bitcoin became 1000x more prevalent the energy spent would increase in a similar way.

That's not how probabilities work...

I don't get it, is 1 BTC= 1 million USD?
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:57:45
You mean S&amp;P500?
@_date: 2017-02-01 05:25:53
No one said they'd use it to predict anything. They're used here to provide information about past prices. Not sure why it wouldn't be perfectly viable here.
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:13:21
And just as volatile?

That's a stupid ass statement, an l is a rectangle... 
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:48:05
Could be true if there were no alternatives to gold.

How do you prevent Sybil attacks with node voting?
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:48:22
Because of arbitrage. If BTC/USD drops without significant capital transfer to an alt, bots will arb away the difference, bringing ALT/BTC up, but ALT/USD down.

It's pretty clear from your comments on this thread that no amount of counter arguments will change your mind. That's when you know you can't think for yourself.

Could you elaborate on what a 2nd layer solution means?

Hahaha, no it's not

[Idk man](
And that's without considering that a good amount of people just can't be bothered to vote. Expecting a 95% support for segwit is just a joke, you wouldn't get 95% support for curing cancer.
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:37:25
Or they could just make it plain illegal to own Bitcoin. That would collapse its price to nearly nothing. Easy to hack then if they wanted to, but what would be the point.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:22:30
According to this will create unwanted spam on the network!
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:14:16
He keeps repeating that the price of gold is backed by its properties as a metal/real world use cases. Are there any estimates on the value due to physical properties vs speculation/store of value? My bet is that the later is a much more significant factor in current gold markets. Any research to back this up?   
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:42:07
He's questioning the character of the very person is referring to. If anything the fallacy lies on side with his strawman (the quotation should've been closer to "O'leary knows something about the internet because he made billions selling computer software.")
People like throwing around fallacy names thinking it somehow makes them look smart. To everyone else they sound like idiots, especially when misused. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:05:14
Why did you have BTC in the first place if you thought it was a scam?
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:09:45
I'm not American. It's still true.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:38:56
Price up, hack incentive up?

That's not what appeal to authority is... 
@_date: 2017-01-29 04:56:44


I think the difference here is that, unlike Bitcoin, Ether isn't seen as a "final product" that only needs adoption to succeed. It's still in development, so it's expected for the chain with the most dev support to be valued more.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:46:25
The first reply to your comment is just that, a reply to your comment. Not sure why you keep extrapolating it to a reply to the headline.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:10:59
Why can't you get money from nothing?
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:29:02
Cause people don't know what probabilities are.

He never said anything about making CP, not sure why you're all conflicting the two...
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:04:43
That exact argument can be made of Bitcoin with its 21 million cap, or any of its properties. When people say it's unchangeable/code is law, what they really do mean is code (or Bitcoin's properties) is determined by consensus.

Which is why that analogy was used in the first place...
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:59:45
That made me cringe :/
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:44:38
Same as for PayPal/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-05 03:31:49
Not sure if serious

"Price moves have more to do with supply halving, steady adoption, triangles and trend lines. "
No it doesn't. It's just people going back and forth between Bitcoins and altcoins. Triangles and trend lines, please...
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:03:52
Are you genuinely asking? Cause I think I know the answer but I'm worried I might get banned if I honestly answer. That should tell you something...

Saying this as a French Canadian, so with CAD $, not sure about the € sign in Europe, but I imagine it's the same. Never quite got why the dollar sign comes first in English and doesn't follow the "XXX dollars" format.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:45:28
Still good news
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:06:46
In French we use $ at the end already.

Bitcoin's tech is stagnating, all its competitors are evolving. Eventually its name recognition won't be enough to counteract the fact that it can't achieve what it's set out to do. It's a shame really if you can't see that...

I don't know man, people pay decent sums to get educated. Not sure why I'd help you out for free.

Your problem is in thinking that this won't happen.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:24:53
The father made that argument first, he's just showing that the price of a unit is irrelevant, just like the price of the nth decimal is. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:27:47
Uh? You can buy BTC with w/e you stole, same argument.

Bitcoin might be a store of value, but it's certainly not a currency. 
W/e man, bet on the slow/steady I'll bet on the quickly improving/higher risk. Best of luck!

Nice comeback, got countered about just as hard as your initial bs comment. Better think of a third one.

Yeah, but what about in 10^35 years? What if I plan on holding for that long? /s

Price can't move if no one sells
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:44:36
I don't think that's a fair assessment. Most positive Bitcoin news are seen as positive for the whole cryptosphere. 
That said, the amount of good news for Ethereum  far outnumbers the ones for BTC as of late, so the reality is that BTC just isn't mentioned all that much anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:15:12
If you don't pay taxes and use/have used public services, you're stealing from everyone else.
Also, buying a house in 2017 in the US can't be a good investment.

There's a clear roadmap that everyone agrees to for Ethereum, not so much for BTC.

What does toxic to prediction markets mean?
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:55:30
That or Bitcoin will fork as people get annoyed seeing it go down another 20% on the global dominance chart for being unable to scale.
@_date: 2017-05-16 04:55:03
Does anyone know the numbers? Because the market cap on CMC is based on circulating supply, not total supply like you seem to be implying.
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:15:44
When a known portion of coins is locked or inaccessible. I believe that could include a dormant address if it's known and significant (50%+ of total).
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:40:04
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:53:55
Because for BTC, circulating=total... Not sure what you're trying to say.

Why does he not suggest better metrics?
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:18:11
What then? What if you sell one of those coins for   x dollars, how would it change that metric?
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:48:13
I've never used their service, but from my understanding it's one of the top exchanges out there. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:40:42
It works if enough people get margin called, which should drop the price lower than the dump alone would.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:59:15
Although they're not perfect quantifiers, those are all metrics that correlate with network effect. Unless you have something better to offer, I'm honestly not sure what the point of the article is other than stating that they're imperfect metrics, to which everyone​ would agree.
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:33:27
Can they be used to sell BTC? What are the fees?
