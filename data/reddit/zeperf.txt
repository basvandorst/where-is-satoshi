Haven't finished it yet, but I agree; he seems like he is going thru an existential crisis.  Rogan picks up on it after a few failed attempts to get a friendly conversation going.

I can't imagine the mood that comes from being one of the top guys with the ability to influence the destination of the human race now starting to feel its not so important.

Also, you need a certain amount of coin reserved for the channel to avoid double spending, correct?  Otherwise you could open multiple private channels with the same coin.

Thank you for the response!  This line from your article helps: 


It seems like the Bitcoin software should be able to instantly update the blockchain so that double spending is not possible and it should automatically reject transactions without appropriate keys, but I suppose that because no one controls the main Bitcoin machine, this is impossible.  Is that about right?

Its extremely unlikely I think.  I don't think ISIS or the donors or the suppliers for ISIS would be comfortable with it.  But if it happened, the media would go apeshit for a week until something else interesting happens and distracts them.  The price would tank for a long time. I don't know if it can be headed off.  I think naturally Bitcoin will be have a much different character before this presents itself as an issue.

They don't want to tank the price though.  The worse they can do is sell out to someone who does, which would be very difficult to do.  Am I wrong?  I don't know a lot about the incentives, but it seems pretty straight forward.

I have trouble explaining Bitcoin to other people.  I start by trying to explain how its decentralized and end up saying that it can adapt by implementing changes decided on by the Bitcoin Foundation.  Is it assumed that in the event that the Bitcoin Foundation started making bad decisions to benefit singular large miners, that a fork should be created to break paths with the Bitcoin Foundation?  It seems like this would be a mess if Bitcoin is large and the majority of users don't understand how it works.
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:07:13
If Bitcoin was ever hugely popular and a fork occurred, how would users chose a blockchain?  Say that in your scenario, they ended up on the SHA256 chain.  There is no protocol for resolving competing chains, right?  The 256 chain would eventually crash to 0 and the users would get screwed.  Am I misunderstanding something?
@_date: 2014-08-28 17:18:34
Alright sorry I was skeptical.  I don't understand the motivation for sharing a trade strategy, but since you created a software for it (good job!) I guess you have an incentive.  The trade hinges on Argentina's peso dropping more than it already has.  Seems the big news is already out and the majority of the drop probably already happened.

I purchased an item from a website about a week ago.  The website asked for my shipping address and then emailed me a public address to send the money to.  I included my order number in the message section of the transaction, but the vendor did not ask me to.  Without that message they have to assume a receipt of money that equals the amount I owed is correlated to my order right?  I also bought a Dan Carlin podcast and he just flashed the public address on the screen and gave me five minutes to pay it.  Both these methods are assuming that my transaction will be the only one of that amount in a recent time window, right?  What is the foolproof method?  Asking for my public address in the order form?
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:19:21
The Bitcoin Foundation is in charge of implementing changes to the protocol, correct?  Are they just a central authority that must be accepted in order for bitcoin to be flexible?  Is there a danger of them being corrupted to prefer big central miners over many little ones?
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:52:37
Gonna try to up the moron in the thread...  If the public/private key encryption is airtight, why do you need the proof of work system to validate the transaction?  Is it possible to broadcast a false transaction if you don't have the private key to the coins you are pretending to own?
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:21:18
I don't understand why you use the terms wallet and blockchain.  You could have said computer instead of wallet and website instead of blockchain.  Blockchain implies that every new submission contains all previous submissions.

Bitcoin is money without government or banks.  It also allows you to spend money online without giving away your bank account number, name, and street address.  I don't know how someone can possibly find this not interesting.
I always get screwed up trying to explain the mining, but I think I got that part figured out now.
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:27:16
Bitcoin needs something like this to help stabilize the value.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:18:04
That makes sense.  I wonder if vendors will be overwhelmed at the idea of managing their own financial ledger.  I suppose to avoid credit card fees, they may be willing to take that risk; and there will probably be thrid-party server space out there that you can just sign up for.  The idea of making use of parked money to make money facilitating transactions outside the blockchain makes a lot of sense.
Ripple allows financial institutions to become similar core nodes that resolve transactions within their networks.  It is designed to allow that resolution to involve *any* digital asset however rather than just bitcoin.  XRP is used to bridge gaps between assets.  I'm not sure how it resolves onto a decentralized ledger though.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:35:09
So its kind of like using a vendor as a bank (core node).  Will these core nodes have to volunteer or can this happen behind the scenes without the core node's knowledge?  Actually is this not similar to Ripple?

... wanting to hold it because its deflationary which is one of the biggest criticisms of bitcoin as a currency.  This isn't just a recent phenomenon, its a design decision that will still be here in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:35:24
I suppose it does make more sense if you are trying to spend a good chunk of money to have it parked in an investment rather than in a bank account.  Losing value happens to be a good motivator to spend but it isn't rational to want the losing value thing in the first place unless its better in some other way.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:07:50
But it will always be deflationary and therefore better as an investment than a currency.

cointal.com and bisq.io are BTC P2P exchanges.  I love the idea of ditching these insane identity verification processes of centralized exchanges. There are very few people on these P2P exchanges now though.  I've wondered if there is money to be made selling at like 5% above market price and then just buying back on a centralized exchange. It feels too risky tho.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:47:28
There isn't much participation and the payment methods are sort of inconvenient.  Cointal looks better but again no participation.

Wouldn't that just be a standard bank at that point?  Vendors would end up subscribing to lightning networks in order to lower their transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:22:01
Exactly what I'm thinking.  A larger lightning network would be cheaper to operate as well because you could network more users without settling to the blockchain.  Its almost identical to standard banking.

That could be a good business model!  The bank just facilitates the loan and has the credibility to run a credit check.  Its hard to say whether there is much to "facilitate" other than providing the credit check, but maybe they could also verify the progress of an investment and report to the creditors.  But of course just bringing the concept to non-technical people is worth something as well.  Cool idea!

Not sure.  I just bought the 5 episodes about the Punic Wars.  Just googled it and it appears Coinbase has implemented recurring payments, but it looks like it has to also be set up at the merchants end.  The podcast is the only thing I've ever bought so I'm not the right person to ask..

I would imagine it depends on what the buyer does with the 50k.  If they try to flip it, then you'll get a crash.  But if they just hold on to it, like US banks have done with US dollars, you won't see any change in value.
