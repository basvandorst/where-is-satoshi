Because it could turn into a larger loss. Why not just sell, sit on the sideline and wait for some support and then buy back in. That way you can skip out on some of the loss in price and actually end up making more money once it stabilizes and hopefully recovers in price.

Have you sold yet?

I never owned any BTC. Just interested in the Crypto markets. I currently invest in California MJ companies. Although I just discovered I have about 9k Stellar Lumens (XLM) from when they launched (early sign up bonus).

Sound advice, don't try and catch a falling knife. Wait for it to hit bottom and then buy back in once you see some support. Until then it's anyone's guess when it will stop falling in price.

Hindsight is 20/20. Don't kick yourself too hard. Just learn from it. Create a set of rules for yourself. This is why stock markets have stop loss orders. You can enter a price ahead of time so you will automatically sell your shares if the price drops to a certain level. This limits the potential loss you are willing to take on your investment before you sit on the sideline to re-evaluate and potentially buy back in or just move on. Best of luck!

Did you notice I wrote hindsight 20/20 and that you never know when something is going to recover in price? I never said Bitcoin wouldn't recover.

Until you see the price stabilize for a bit and stop crashing. I can't define "a bit" for you though. Everyone has to decide for themselves when they think it will turn around.

K, well, good luck.

I don't think you understand that saying. To catch a falling knife in the market means DON'T BUY when a stock is crashing. Wait for it to show some support and increase in price and then buy back in. You definitely should sell and sit on the sidelines for now.

Why not? You can always buy back in once you think it has hit bottom. Might as well save yourself the money in the mean time.

Why do that when you can just play the dips. Throw the cat under the ladder a few times, load up. Then lock the cat up for a few months. Take profits, rinse and repeat.
Or if your a whale just create your own dips by selling massive amounts all at once to cause a market panic. Then buy back in at the bottom.

I would just recommend not buying all at once. It is impossible to say when this dip will end. So pace yourself, don't go all in all at once because you think it hit bottom. Just slowly accumulate what you can afford. Maybe purchase a little bit once a week if you are bullish on the future of bitcoin. Your average purchase price should still be pretty good in the long run.

You mean -$20k a coin?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:35
I would say HODL only works for people who can wait 5-10 years and do that without even checking daily prices. Once you start checking daily, you get sucked into the mood swings. If you truly believe in HODLing, just let your coins sit in your wallet and go do something else for 5 years. Maybe only let yourself check the price once or twice a year.

Your probably right, their plan would be to push this as low as possible then. No telling how low it could go. If you owned 40% of the coins, what would you do to maximize your profits? You would be in a unique position to manipulate an unregulated market.

That's not even a spin off, that's just called buying low and selling high.

Bahaha awesome story
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:47:35
I would wait for the real panic to set in. There are still lots of hodlers who will sell in the coming weeks when their ulcers get the best of them. People keep telling themselves they are long term investors, but they watch the price daily anyway, eventually some of those people will sell out of fear as they slowly watch their money dwindle. I don't think this is over yet.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:44:02
How about I save you some time right now and you just give me 50% of what you planned on investing.
PM me for where you can wire transfer me the money. ;)
