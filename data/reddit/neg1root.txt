Are you referring to Ethereum.org, Storj.io, or another project?

Where are you getting that info? Or is it a hunch?
@_date: 2014-11-03 03:22:20
This is great! I was in Ivor's sub learning how to changetip but the private feature never came up. Thanks!

No doubt such a move would presage a drop in price. Aside from the regulatory confusion surrounding Bitcoin in China, the executives at Alibaba know that Bitcoin adoption would move the market considerably and, since penalties for insider trading in Bitcoin don't exist, they await regulatory clarity and the perfect moment to sell their information to the highest bidders.

Don't listen to me. I'm not supposed to be here. To begin:
Bitcoins are spendable, exchangeable for cash, and ownership of them is internationally transferable. 13
Bitcoins are mathematically controlled, may be split apart, and  don't need third parties like banks or governments to regulate them. 20-33
Bitcoin software runs on a network of computers owned by private individuals. 12-45
Downloading the public Bitcoin software is free. It is open source and was first released in 2009. 17-62
The software runs a balance sheet for Bitcoin keychains. A person may own multiple keychains but Bitcoins won't exceed 21,000,000. 20-82
All Bitcoins inside all keychains are constantly verified with military-grade codes by the software, and during every ownership transfer. 20-102
Bitcoins don't require mutual trust, a bank, or government. Ownership of any Bitcoin is transferable by the owner to anyone else's keychain, instantly, for microscopic fees,  26-128

I tried to buy an item from DailyDealy.ca at about 1:35AM this morning, they called it a mispayment, and now I can't get them on the phone. I've also sent in a customer service ticket to DailyDealy by email that they haven't responded to either.
I'm getting a bit worried as the amount I spent is a lot to me.
Also, I used a Coinbase wallet and so does DailyDealy. So far, Coinbase has been very responsive in answering questions but surprisingly unhelpful in actually helping me resolve the issue.
@_date: 2014-11-29 07:19:41
Thanks. I would like to know how they got on the list in the first place.

Part of what draws serious people is the complexity. Leave the decimals alone and make something that will grow bitcoin's ecosystem instead.

That "penny" will one day buy a decent used car because it's not a penny until you exchange the Bitcoin for a penny and no one with an iota of sense would make that trade. But of course you knew that...

I just sent a tip to +MKBHD on YouTube...
I'm hoping that Marques will open a Changetip account and collect his 100,000 satoshis. Then, maybe he'll mention how great and painless the experience was for him. He has almost 2,000,000 subscribers.

Technically, since I never exchanged them for fiat I made nothing ;&gt;
But thank you *oh so much* for the encouragement. It's truly a pleasure to converse with such a charming person as yourself.

Very kind of you to say and thank you for taking this seriously.

How does changetip work? What happens on the backend? What information can you share about changetip that is most relevant *in using it to trigger widespread adoption of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:30:29
A wire transfer is reversible if it's sent to the wrong person.
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:40:56
OK. I appreciate your candor. Now, is that position, that Coinbase and Changetip aren't competitors, published anywhere on the Coinbase website... in the blog perhaps (because, if so, I didn't see it)?
-and I don't mean to sound rude :)

Changetip has stated they use off-chain transactions.
***Off-chain means that they hold a certain amount of btc at cold wallet address 1234 and they use an internal ledger to allocate shares of that address amongst their users (ABC -&gt; DEF, GHI -&gt; JKM, etc).***
***Because the tips go from one changetip user to another (ABC -&gt; DEF) the btc they hold on the chain at 1234 never leaves address 1234. Thus, they never have to pay fees. But, the instant that someone withdraws btc from their tip.me address to a non-Changetip wallet, say, address 5678, then Changetip must execute a transfer on the actual blockchain (on ledger).***
But clearly, Changetip is smart. So I think (and I have no inside knowledge of this as yet) that they hold 100% of their users' funds in a mix of _hot_ : _cold_ wallets, probably in a _0.5_ : _95.5_ ratio.
Further, as stated in other comments here, they don't need to charge fees because of the VC millions; some of which they might also be using to daytrade and earn btc that belongs solely to them.
In case you wonder, that's just what I would do with a small part of the VC money. I'd be very clear with the VC's (seriously!) and I'd start trading accounts of between $50,000 and $100,000 on Bitpay, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.
Then, provided I earn a profit using that method, I could deposit the principle and keep daytrading with the profits. In fact, it's likely that some of the VC's urged Changetip to daytrade a modest fraction of the VC tranche because some of the VCs are likely to have expertise in daytrading, derivatives, fractional reserve investing, etc. themselves.
After that, if I played it safe, it's all gravy. I would periodically pull profits into cold wallets (adding them to the principal I already took of the market) and use those to pay (1) the miner fees, if anyone actually withdraws their tips and (2) the VCs. After awhile, I'd be daytrading with the profits I took, from the profits I took, from the profits I took...
They're a free service forever if they play their cards right. But I am, as a Changetip user, still a product because they took VC money. However, if they are able to pay back the VC money, and if they can manage to never go public, then there is an outside chance that I might not be a Changetip product forever.

First 2 paragraphs:
Bitcoin heralds a new age more disruptive than that of today’s Internet. Disruption can be a good thing, especially when it affects banking, a failing set of business models which, for all the tweaks, have been virtually unchanged for millennia. Paradoxically, some banks are afraid of Bitcoin because it would force them to innovate.
Bitcoin is but the most famous example of an emerging technology network with the potential to improve banking. It belongs to the new type of financial animal called crypto currencies, i.e. decentralized, secure money storage and money transfer enabled by the Internet. What Bitcoin, and the even more promising Ripple network do, is not to poke a hole in banking’s basic business models—lending, deposits, trading, and money exchange—but to create the embryos for entirely new markets typically referred to as the Internet of Value. That is, a way for regular folks, as well as specialists, to potentially monetize everything, regardless of location, traditional market access and jurisdiction

Your facts about the 2008 collapse are unarguable. Your logic is also rock hard as to the seeming inevitability of QE4. But I was asking for the actual announcement because, as I learned from an earlier post here on reddit, it ain't true til it's been announced officially.

Hi Robin,
Good luck moving forward! I'm not going to ask awkward questions about Coinbase :)
Do you feel like merchants in African countries want to accept BTC? I mean, there are a lot of remittances, so it might make sense...
Also, what do you think about Zimbabwe's choice to make Bitcoin one of its national currencies and, how do you feel about Bitdrop (coming soon to Dominica)?
Finally, DC is an Uber stronghold so, in your own opinion, should we expect Uber to accept BTC in days, weeks, or months?
@_date: 2014-11-30 05:11:16
So, you're saying there were too many that passed the entry criteria so you were overwhelmed and couldn't fully vet the whole list?
