Did you really type bitcoin into the search bar, then come all the way here, just to say that?  
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:17:13
Just drink your drink already :(

If this hits the news it's only going to read, "60mil stolen in Bitcoin hack". Which might spur prices downwards again. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:00:06
What do you dislike the most about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:46:27
Shoot, my moon is living out of a van.  
Wise words though, sir. Wise indeed.

If you buy from coinbase or gdax you don't know where you're coins are coming from. You could end up with a stolen coin without realizing it.

Turn off my mining rig and buy.

Now to see if it does anything. I think at worst, scare off some newcomers. Dunno if that be enough to dip the price even $50 though.  
Edit- Well unless that hacker dumps all 4k+ coins at once. Which I doubt.

Trade your family for bitcoin.

He actually said to to me, "It's like gambling but smarter".
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:26:02
This makes me wonder about the distant future when more and more coin is lost. Eventually it is going to deplete quite significantly.

I’m curious what I should do. I generally make around 200 a month mining coin, plus invest money. What should I be reporting when I start cashing out?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:14:44
So I need to pay taxes on something I haven’t even converted to fiat? Blah.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:06:39
So all hodlers are gamblers.

We both make decent money. He's never gambled over his head, just used his disposable income to slam around on video roulette machines. So I don't worry about that to much.

I’m not understanding how it is not profitable. On paper an Avalon Miner 741 makes money even with .15 electric costs in my region. Difficulty Is currently on a downward trend and if I reinvest in my rig and do not spend or hold the profit I don’t see how I can’t remain profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:39:10
This makes a great deal more sense to me. If the difficultly was to increase so dramatically and rapidly I wouldn't have the capital necessary to stay profitable. However, the resale on the S9's seems to be solid, if not leaving room for a bit of profit. It seems about the same gamble you make when buying bitcoin. You could end up rich, or lose every dollar you put in.
I heed your words sir, and greatly appreciate the time you took to give me detailed explanation of why it's a risky move to invest in mining your own bitcoin.
I think with the resale value of the S9 though, it's a risk that isn't incredibly detrimental. All of us bitcoiners are just a bit to headstrong to let anyone tell us it can't be done ;)
Thanks again my friend.

The next predicted difficulty is indeed lower than it is now, if I’m understanding what I am reading correctly. More miners to the pool would indeed increase this is time. I just have trouble understanding. Even my own calculations have me making money at 9k a coin. I don’t aim to be rich or live of mining, just make a few dollars on the side and hold.
Kudos for having the most in depth response so far but I still don’t understand how I won’t make money.
Also I think you misunderstood me. I was saying current miners want to discourage people from mining to prevent the difficulty from increasing at an ever more rapid rate, I apologize for not making that clear.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:17:29
Man I'm hoping
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:21:35
And here I was waiting to buy at another 9.1k dip. Guess I'm doubling down for the 1k dip.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:43:33
I feel like people that are strongly encouraging you not to are either: A)ignorant entirely to the subject and just regurgitate what they see other people saying, or B) current miners that don’t want the pool increased thus increasing hardware prices and mining difficultly.
I have yet to receive a straight and sound answer as to why on paper a machine will make money but in their world it won’t.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:37:20
That was pretty much my thought. Try to get one as close to MSRP as possible and if it doesn't work out, make my money back selling it.
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:06:11
I keep seeing people say it’s not profitable. However I am seeing more than a few machines that on paper are profitable. I’ve also heard that miners tend to spread the disinformation that mining isn’t profitable in an attempt to keep people out of the market to keep hardware prices low. I’m not sure what to think at this point.
