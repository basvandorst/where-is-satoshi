You are deluded

By the way kraken fanboy who gets the special arse licking treatment to make you feel special... i was polite to them...and all i wanted was regular service. so you have made a false assumption there.  Only now am i fed up and the gloves are off.

How is your post 'Case Bitcoin Wallet is Complete TRASH' any different to mine?? Double standards you hypocrite 
@_date: 2017-04-22 05:59:43
By the way, your statement 'who would want to go out of their way to help you...acting like this' is completely illogical: firstly im not asking for anyone to go out of their way..secondly i'm only being so blunt now... After the 3 weeks i've been ignored.

Erm yes correct....entirely due to poor systems at Kraken!! Thank you for supporting the point of this thread.

'Keep up the good work' (of ignoring support requests for 3 weeks)... Err yeah ok kraken fanboy shill.     
'he doesnt know how to act in the business world'... Errr ok mr bigshot business man...just cause youre happy with your special treatment  everyone else should keep quiet while they get ignored for 3 weeks. Nice try fanboy

Let me get this right...you are sayong that because I'm new I'm not alowed to highlight terrible customer service because I should be trying to build a better relationship....get lost you shill
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:43:30
It's revealing that you are trying to convince me how nice you can be and how rich you are.
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:39:31
You have missed the point somewhat...I don't doubt that it's flawed...just as I have pointed out that kraken customer service is flawed

did it cross your mind that maybe you should be looking through your old &amp; unanswered support tickets instead of browsing reddit?
@_date: 2017-04-22 02:10:05
So what you are saying is that they are selectively replying to their support requests...that they are reading them. ..replying to some within a day...but choosing to ignore the little guys for 3 weeks. Welcome to the way kraken does business everyone.
