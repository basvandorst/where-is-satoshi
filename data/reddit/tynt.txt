Are you suggesting cashing out 1.8M worth of bitcoins on localbitcoins instead?

Paper gold is better than physical gold because it's better to move around. Paper bitcoin is just as easy to move around then actual bitcoin, so there is too little incentive to take a risk.

No, bitcoin is not going to turn everyone into hippies. This is free-market capitalism. Robocoin is not bitcoin. Robocoin is a profit seeking company. Robocoin offers the best bitcoin ATM service and this is their fee.

She wasted her own argument saying "On the other hand barrier of entry to traditional payments are low for most part of the world" or some thing like this. For most part of the world, people don't have access to a bank and bitcoin is going to be adopted there much faster than VISA.

I agree with Peter on everything except GoldMoney. GoldMoney has counterparty risk, GoldMoney can become the next Federal Reserve that don't want to its reserves to be audited. Second problem is how much is gold worth? Yes it will always have value but how much? Maybe its just 1% of current value. Maybe gold has stable value for thousands of years because it was the best candidate for money... until Bitcoin.

I'm not sure what do you want. Someone with your username, with your password (with trojan it's possible to do it from your IP and at your own computer) has withdrawn some money and you demand it back.
One solution is that mtgox starts to offer an insurance service, it costs $100 a month. If anyone withdraws funds with your password and from your computer, then mtgox would happily recover your funds up to $100 a month.
If someone withdraws money with my debit card and with my PIN number from the ATM, then bank will not refund me anything. There is only small chance, that police will catch the crook and there is a small chance that crook will have the money to pay me back.

Say if avg person sends 1000 emails per year, and receives about 1M spam email per year (count in all spam that is filtered along the way). If email would cost tenth of a cent, then avg person would pay $1 per year, but spammers would have to pay you $100 a year. Spammers will not pay you $100 per year. Spam is going to die.
