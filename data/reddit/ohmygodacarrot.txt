Ive heard that it takes about 1-2 days after you attempt to sell for it to actually go through to your bank account. So if this is the case, say I were to sell right at this moment with the price at $10,000. Will the amount I get in my bank account be based on the bitcoin price right now, or in 1-2 days when I actually get the money? 
Ex: bitcoin is at $10,000 rn, I sell it. In 2 days it drops to $7,000. Will I get 10k or 7k?
