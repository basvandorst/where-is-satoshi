yeah? and receive no help at all.  that had already been done when i made this thread.
tree540, unless you're going to do something yourself, trust that i've already exhausted all my options.

note: i expect, as you said, for the price at the time of deposit to be honored. i hope you will be able to expedite this process.

I can't possibly understand (as someone with a background in economics) why you would choose to launch another cryptocurrency in addition to bitcoin.  
Why do you believe that doing so will have an effect other than lowering the value of bitcoins, both in the short and long term?

i'm having the same problem as everyone else, purchased about 200 dollars of bitcoins this afternoon and have had no success. sent an email to bitinstant and of course nothing after 5 hours now. how can you guarantee coins in one hour when things like this happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:27:02
because their value is volatile and they are worth money.

this is really what i was hoping for. i'm pretty disappointed right now.  i also really hope i don't lose all the money from the deflation that has been occurring over the last 24 hours. bitcoins have gone up from about 160 to closer to 190...  i wouldn't be losing a ton of money considreing i deposited less than a bitcoin's worth, but still... they GUARANTEED me a quote and they also GUARANTEED me coins within one hour. the fact that it took them upwards of 12 hours to respond to my posts and PMs illustrates the quality of this service.

economically, if a substitute is made for anything (i.e. a GENERIC drug of a name brand), they begin to compete and prices of both will fall..

thanks for saying this, me too

bitinstant customers are getting fucked over regardless of whether they're depositing into MTGOX or anywhere else.  
maybe you should read the forum link i posted instead of passive-aggressively telling me im an uninformed idiot. if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all.

just check this thread and you have a TON of people complaining of the same thing as me--everything works great until the money gets to bitinstant, they take the money and don't deposit any BTC where they're supposed to go.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:03:46
how did this happen? did you only lose an entire deposit or $30 or was the loss because the price was changing?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:04:14
you're wrong. the value is going to continue growing, it's just once there are good exchanges that won't get hacked and fail or have to undergo more transactions than they can handle...
the value of BTC is at what it's actually worth right now, I believe if you buy sometime during this dip you will be pleasasntly surprised over the next few months..
