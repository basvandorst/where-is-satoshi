I'm thinking about 6-8k.  Many people think it will get  the support @ 8k, I think and always have as I seen the downward trend.  It'll go below 8k slightly - 6k.  I think 4-6k and we'll see a SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW recovery. 
2-3 years 20k seems possible.  I was thinking a year or two.  Tried to sell off my bitcoins the day before the crash, seller bs'd me.  Sold on the day of the dip literally at the tip of it.  About 14k, feeling really good now.

IF it hits 60k, there's really absolutely no guarantee it'll even go back to 20k.

This thread is way, way too premature. It hasn't even recovered completely.

There was a price surge before the announcement, there was obviously inside trading going on.  They ploughed cash into BCH before the announcement.  I've moved all my money off of coinbase anyway because I already predicted this type of behaviour.

Hopefully it does, so I can buy some.  It'll go back up, if bitcoin dies the whole crypto market dies because people'll lose trust in cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin cash will either remain stable or be dumped now, the big gains are gone. 
I expect gains from bitcoin cash to go back into bitcoin.

Bitcoin isn't dying because people aren't using btc as a payment system.  99% of people are using it as a store of value, you seen how the whole market reacted today.  If bitcoin does die, the whole crypto market dies with it because nobody will trust crypto as an investment anymore.
So yeah, two scenarios.  One bitcoin recovers (likely scenario).  Bitcoin dies and everything else with it as people move their money out of crypto and take their losses.

Gonna say it right now, for every one person who pays off their college debts/made a ton of cash.  There's gonna be 10 people who lose 10k each.

The market cap has already recovered about 40% of what it lost so yeah, it's gonna recover easily.  People only bought BCH because they knew this would happen and they'll dump it for profits instantly, I was an hour too late to do this myself.

Everyone will cash out at some point, it's just risk taking.  How much of a gamble do you want to take.  I figure we can possibly get 50-100k but given the already massive market cap, it'll take trillions to realise this.  I don't see it going past 100k though, if I'm honest.
You won't be able to capture everyone's money and bitcoins marketshare may shrink.  I think it's getting riskier and riskier to play now.  I'm probably done at 50k.  I ask myself this question constantly, what has crypto done to warrant trillions in investment?  The answer is nothing so far.

Where?  I see it 3-4k, it'll go down.  Not buying into the hysteria.  That's how you REALLY lose money.
