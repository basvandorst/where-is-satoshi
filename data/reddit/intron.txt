It's a small, low-cost ARM processor powered board that can operate an external device when a bitcoin payment is made by a user. It has a wifi module to connect to the internet and an NFC chip to talk to a smartphone that is tapped to the board.
The price to be paid is a fixed fiat amount, by reading the btc rate using the wifi module with regular intervals the btc amount is calculated and sent by NFC to the user holding a smartphone. By using smart posters a wallet app is launched automatically and the user is asked to confirm the payment. When this is done, the board scans the blockchain to see whether the payment has been made (just checking n_tx, not waiting for confirmation).
A switch is then closed and some external device can be operated. This can be used to open a door, get candy from a machine, or something else.
It's basically the same as the Raspi/Arduino solutions that are around, but this is much smaller, cheaper and has NFC. And the board and almost all code was made by myself, what is more fun to do I guess;)

This was only a PoP, but maybe, when someone shows interest. 
Got a lot more attention when we made the bitfury miners, LOL:)
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:25:27
Brilliant! 
How many blocks did you solve already? ;)
@_date: 2014-06-27 10:45:10
...I am deeply sorry.

Thanks, really great.

They can even mine (a tiny bit) for you:)

Negative 1.07% hike now, 11.8 days to go.
What's not to understand?
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:40:13
Tried to donate, but couldn't find the bitcoin option.

And here we go:

First time I see a negative diff hike since I
started mining year and a half ago...

Same question here. 
Highly interested...

Here's a picture then. Paying for Thai food

Nice. I downloaded the film from PB and sent some btc to their wallet. Would be much easier if it could be purchased directly from the on demand platform.

I only have a bunch of homebrewed

Network hashrate is falling harder now:

And to this sleepsession guy: you are sure what
the word 'apex' means?

There is also one in Delft, Netherlands.
In cafe de Waag.

Nice:) Made a low-cost version of this with NFC and WiFi,
just playing around:
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:30:58
You can even bet on it:)

@_date: 2016-02-16 09:24:53
Does it have a string option?
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:17:23
Oh I see, they are run from 'The Land of the Free'. I think I pass then...
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:35:48
Why do you have to know my real name + address when I only have lost BTC in Mt. Gox? Is it possible to remain anonymous?
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:04:07
They can just send the BTC to my address, no questions need to be asked then IMHO. Not sure to give my full name + address for a few KUSD...
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:16:33
I will just give up my coins, not comfortable giving my name + address to some crypto company...
@_date: 2015-03-04 13:45:01
Is this the start if 'paper bitcoin'?
Just like there is more paper gold
then physical gold?
