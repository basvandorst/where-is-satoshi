You had several typos in the post you just made as well.. The second time I wrote out the 53 words, I was no longer in a hurry. Who cares if I wrote comon or come on, if you want to debate the price of bitcoin that's all i'm interested in talking about here.

Yeah definitely. I'm hoping for $50k-$100k per coin, but $1M would be crazy. Wouldn't mind being proven wrong on this one. Hoping ETH rides that boat up too!

Where do you get that math? We aren't talking about a percentage here. There will be a point at which everyone who is going to buy BTC is aware of it, there isn't an infinite supply of new investors. If BTC is the best crypto it could very well end up at $1T-$2T in market cap. If it's not then it may never hit $1T.  This is not an exponential curve that goes up forever, that is incredibly unrealistic.

I hope so, I feel like things have certainly changed in 2018 compared to 2017 though. The awareness and entrance of large institutional investors, as well as significant crypto competition, has very much changed the game and as always, previous returns do not predict future results.

Yep. I'm absolutely looking to have a good healthy discussion around crypto prices, not about grammar. As long as my manager is OK with my formal communication skills, then so am I.

Nope, I'm on the internet, where slang is more than appropriate in this context. Moreover, when typing on a phone or when in a hurry it makes sense to shorten words so as to type them faster. You should worry less about my use of slang and try and rebuttal my argument. Thanks.

I do agree with that point. I think the analogy ends though in the fact that facebook is something for the masses. Bitcoin, unless it truly does surpass FIAT, will still be an alternative to FIAT, and an alternative to other cryptocurrencies. It will not necessarily be useful to the masses, in the same way that a large portion of the population is not invested in any stocks whatsoever.

Comon now, does anyone actually believe this? It won't just go up and up forever. There eventually hits a point where people feel it's fairly valued and/or overbought. There is no way that point is $1M. Is there a chance it hits $100k? Sure, maybe i'll concede that, but this is just a pipe dream..
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:50:07
That's a great point, I certainly wouldn't have believed them, and there is a chance I'm wrong, and I even own BTC so i'm hoping it hits $1M. However, there is also something to be said for not getting hopes up too high. If I say that AAPL will hit $10T market cap in the next few years that would likely be absurd. It doesn't mean I think AAPL is going to do poorly, just that there is a point at which it will only go up by small percentages at a time, and not go up 100x every year.

Did you understand what it meant? Is it sometimes used online? Then who cares? I'm wholly open to a debate about BTC valuation, let's move on from whether or not you agree or disagree with my shorthand on the internet..
