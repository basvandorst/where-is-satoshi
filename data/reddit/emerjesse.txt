Another tip to deal with that:
[instawallet]( provides an instant online wallet which you can use as an obfuscating proxy.
First transfer your btcs to a instawallet account.
Maybe wait a bit to allow for other transactions to get in between.
Then transfer from instawallet to your silkroad address. 
You can also use the green address option, such that the transaction will come from a single well known address shared amongst many users.
Edit: The amount of the transaction could arguably be a clue to trace back to the original transaction, I can't remember if Instawallet does that natively, but you can alternatively split your transactions into unequal chunks for extra obfuscation.

One more important thing: (can you add it to your guide?)
Most vendors have a [PGP]( public key in their profile, even if it isn't necessarily stressed in their book announcements.
Use that key to encrypt your delivery address and all your messages. 
You can do that simply and locally with a javascript tool:
[ 
You may in turn update your profile or tell the vendor of your public key, such that vendors can encrypt their answers, and you can also sign any further message. 
They all know how to deal with this.

Ok while we are here again speculating in the wild about Satoshi's identity, let me add my 2 cents:
Assuming Satoshi is not Japanese, his name could be an homage to a [famous Japanese composer]( 
Also, Satoshi wrote twice "sorry to be a wet blanket" in the forum, which is once more than anybody else. There shouldn't be too many candidates with a crush for that uncommon idiom.
