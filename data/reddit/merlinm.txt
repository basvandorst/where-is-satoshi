thank you. is it a given that this is going to happen? for example, if segwit addresses the immediate scaling problems and new technologies lighting address the long term need, is it possible we may stay at 1mb for an extended duration if not forever?

government attacks has really only ever been the only threat.  the chance of such an attack being successful (should they occur) becomes less with every day.
solving the N:P space would be distant second place :-D

is increasing the blocksize also 'locked in' at this point?

history has been unkind to people who think they can infallibly time markets.

Isn't the entire point to see some centralization so that payment operators can trade off some risk for a small fee and faster transactions?  Nobody is making you use lightning, but it will lead to much more efficient network utilization overall right?

Ah, that's a little harsh.  Paypal is a retail service that rides a fiat system; paypal isn't really the problem, they provide a userful service for a fee.  The **fiat system** is the problem.  A hypothetical BitcoinPal would ride directly on top of BTC so that you'd exchange some centralization for ease of use.  There is nothing wrong with that so long as it's a voluntary system.
Where I'd agree with you is if regulatory bodies tried to force you to interact with the system only through retail networks.
