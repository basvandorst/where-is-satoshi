Ok, as one of the shit-eating office I-told-ya-so'ers I feel like its worth sharing an alternative perspective.  I have no stake in Bitcoin, and don't feel strongly about it one way or another.  Frankly, I don't know jack shit about the technology, and don't pretend to.  What I DO have an opinion about are all the buyers who are equally clueless and took a position in Bitcoin acting like they were the next goddamn Warren Buffet.  People who have ZERO understanding of the technology or how valuation works and for weeks were gloating about their so-called returns.  I think the sense of schadenfreude you are witnessing is largely a reaction to those types of individuals.  They are basically just as clueless as your Becky, but pretended to be know-it-alls when things were moving in the opposite direction.

I don't claim to know anything.  The point I was making is that neither did a lot of people who were investing on the hype.

Yea, I didn't mean to imply that everyone who bought into bitcoin did so without any understanding of the currency.  Only that there are a certain class of buyers for whom that is true (largely the ones who bought purely on hype over the last 2 months)

I largely agree.  I don't begrudge anyone who made money in bitcoin, I just begrudge when people pretend like they invested as a result of some deep insight or were doing anything other than making a speculative gamble.  I don't suggest every investment needs to be rooted in deep financial acumen, I just insist on calling a spade a spade when it is not.
