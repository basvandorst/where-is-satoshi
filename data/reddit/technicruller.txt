It’s like you can’t lose with this strategy!!
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:24:21
Other comment addresses how you’d do this (I use binance). Woo boy is it good fun alternating between alts and BTC, wish I had discovered it earlier. I’ve mostly focused on XLM &lt;-&gt; BTC.

Is there an echo in here? U crazy son! This guys post history is gold everyone!
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:44:14
You don’t have a substantive point. You’re just screaming “the sky is falling” 17 hours a day every day. Like...why?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:38:52
This is the ultimate realization. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:38:38
MikeP! Been missing your negative spam!
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:56:09
Guy sounds like a retard. Trading isn’t for losers, indeed the exact opposite.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:17:57
They always do the opposite of convention, so $20,000 inc
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:49:54
To be fair, it was only close to 20k for like 2 glorious minutes and Coinbase was shitting the bed. My average sale price is something like $15,000.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:49:43
Whew. Saved a little bit of my 2013 haul and I’ve been buying into this chop for the past week or so, feels good to get it moving up. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:07:18
Just bought to do my part!
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:44:31
This is applicable to basically every action you take in a given day.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:56:12
Up over 10% myself.  Oh shit well over 10%
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:11:16
Lol I think their investors would be pretty pissed to hear this. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:17:20
...what? No.
You’re just a troll. Not gonna bother.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:09:59
Lol 4PM hits, markets close, price rebounds. Me thinks someone is going to make a bundle when contracts expire 1/17 @ $13810.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:13:38
Meh. Between the mortgage and the car I’ll be able to reallocate enough funds into BTC in a monthly basis to quickly re-acquire a stash large enough to float me if it truly moons.
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:54:22
Interesting question. Commenting to follow.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:42:18
Jesus. How many posts a day are you averaging? And when do you sleep lol?
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:34:04
Brevity is the soul of FUD, remember this.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:59:07
Selling at bed time and buying during breakfast has been a pretty winning combo this week.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:44:59
Why would it dip after the futures? This dip is now. After close on the 26th it’ll hit 12,000ish.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:20:32
This statement is inconsistent with your post history.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:15:29
Let’s go 12.5!
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:47:23
Juuuuuuuust about there!
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:35:38
You can just go to the websites of CBoE and CME
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:58:43
Don’t listen to this dude. Read his post history and Tron moves.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:24:02
You purported to be out on 1/11/18 with a 25% profit. Also - all of your statements have been negative. I don’t gather what you think is FUD. I believe you’re attempting to project.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:54:39
Ffs...BTC hits $12,500 and I can unload my last .77BTC and pay off my car. So annoying...should have sold off everything when I paid off my house.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:24:50
(New $ - Old $) / Old $
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:38
If that was moved into Bitcoin it would equate to $8383 per coin increase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:17
Because there was always ever going to be one currency. People log into coinbase and see yet another crypto added, subsequently weigh the immaturity of this market vs a market that just received a huge tax break. Opportunity cost paves the way.

The more things change the more they stay the same.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:31:18
You sure do! The current price is where the buy and the sell walls meet and concur on a price. 
Stare at it for a few days and you’ll have a new understanding of supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:00:21
I’m most interested to hear what they did with taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:13:34
I want a pound of gold so bad. But without having to give up a bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:03:20
I’ve been following this guy for quite some time now. It’s exciting to see him remain so confident and revise his original value estimate.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:36:54
I’m out at $96,000
Or maybe like $350,000
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:48:05
Damn. Straight fire, son. If only my Casascius coins weren't outvalued by the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:46:46
Happy I picked a few of these bad boys up way back on the day. Wonder what they're worth over the base value of the bitcoin. Not a very public secondary market for them.
