Two of the biggest products in their day before being sold to macro media/adobe... Also brought Brightcove public.... The dude knows what he's doing . 
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:44:27
With JA leading it, it'll be big.
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:12:02
Nah his prior company, Brightcove, just went public a few years back. Don't see circle going public anytime soon... JA likes to build his companies independently before going public, and he has a good track record of doing so.

Interesting. I'd love to see when they release this client without the need of the hardware device.

As a Sysadmin, this made me twitch. SCALE EVERYTHING!!!

we should probably test this. everyone turn off your miners so I can make sure the math works.

This should be a note on for ALL EXCHANGES. Never buy/sell at market unless you have a definite reason for doing so.

Maybe you should edit your original post. You know, to stop spreading fear and terror to all.
@_date: 2013-03-14 21:34:12
wow very awesome. may I ask what your using for a front end and graphing/charting? 
edit -- from viewing the source it looks like some highly customized jquery. veddy veddy nice.

I'll probably release it on github in a week or so after I finish my testing and publish my blog post.

I'm just throwing this out there cause I've used them. Email verification for withdraws did work. And! Before they canceled PayPal withdraws I was sent 250 usd to my Paypal acct in under 24 hrs.

OP Confirmed it was a caching issue with his browser and not a security issue. Lots did lose coins due to the trollbox link hijacking but there isn't anything else btc-e can do to prevent users from clicking on links and running unsigned java applets.
That being said, yeah they were Russian scammers, but obviously they are legit to a degree now. If they were stealing coins all the time why the hell would they have the huge user base? 
You should be enabling email withdrawal confirmations, disabling trollbox, and logging into btc-e in incognito mode. In addition to encrypting your local wallet. These guys running the site could be 15yrs for all you know so be wide about what you do. Sure they may lock out your account after 3 failed password attempts via the login page, but who's to say the API is throttled? Maybe it's possible to brute force the key? 
Just be safe and keep yer pitchforks to a minimum people.

Yep. I just coded up a script for this actually while doing some researching.
Generates a private key and address based upon the paraphrase you use (or an entire file full of passphrases). For example, using 'fuckyou' as a passphrase probably isn't a good idea (someone actually did T one point, wallet is empty tho). 
    h python bitcoin-scanner.py 'fuckyou'
    string: fuckyou - private key: 1LdgTMX2MEqdfT3VcDpX4GyD1mqCP8LkYe
    first seen: 1325084623
    amount: 0
thankfully, nobody is using 'gimme da loot' =P
    h python bitcoin-scanner.py 'gimme da loot'
    string: gimme da loot - private key: 1AYmvzSbZrdhV5S39S2Ce1u3xBqAhJUYaG

Just wanted to pass this along. I posted this to first, but its possible other cryptocurrencies may be affected as well. 
it looks like its a good possibility with the popular litecoin wallet android client:
xx:xx xx$ grep -R Random litecoin-wallet/*
litecoin-wallet/wallet/src/de/schildbach/wallet/litecoin/util/EncryptionUtils.java:import java.security.SecureRandom;
litecoin-wallet/wallet/src/de/schildbach/wallet/litecoin/util/EncryptionUtils.java:	private static final SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
litecoin-wallet/wallet/src/de/schildbach/wallet/litecoin/util/EncryptionUtils.java:			secureRandom.nextBytes(salt);
my guess is other cryptocoin android wallets use the same function. 
with some pseudocode that could be run against a litecoin block explorer:

People have been stealing btc since march last year with this. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 00:16:30
It did. Earliest I can find is march 2012.

or it goes down and then get more expensive drugs.

looks legit - 
.... not.

This is probably why - circle.com. Lots of talk about bitcoin today with a new company funded with 9M USD. More than bitpay was.

Not really unsuccessful, just needed to limit my queries. I found Abe to be a huge load on my system, and the API didn't have a nice way of querying available balance on a specific address, so I had to scrape the regular web interface. I know there was some bitcoin node backed stuff as well that's like block explorer, but I never invested much time into getting it working.
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:27:54
what are you using to verify actual data within a wallet once you have the public address generated? Ive tried using web api's but they all throttle. been kinda unsuccessful with abe and such on my local db.
