i disagree... it might be the best decision he ever made or the stupidest... but i dont think he will end up with nothing

i love how people always try to get somebody to work for them for nothing... how about you learn how to code yourself as good as 3 people
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:34:13
the blog is life now and the mailing list subscription, too. i am actually the marketing guy.. my father is running the company
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:50:43
your post is way to confusing to be of value :-D even a spammer needs to use proper instruction if he wants money :-D

i also bought bitcoinlocate.com just yesterday to start a directory on bitcoin merchants.. but with a bit different concept than the current directories like bitcoindir.com
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:51:29
the launch is still some time out... really good beer needs time... its the first beer in the valley and one other brewer in the region has an excellent premium beer selling it to a top luxury foods vendor. so we hope to attach to this excellence in beer brewing

feel free to add firesteel to  :-)
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:07:33
not at all .. we are just buying the equipment and already have the brewing license... there will be much more info on the website soon.
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:55:43
thank you :-) i am looking forward to drinking it with everyone :-)
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:38:00
prlog is an awesome website by the way. i also use it for press releases
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:37:35
i think i did already :-)
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:41:03
we love beer :-D me and my dad :-D
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:54:26
yes... and the girls are cute and the guys laid back :-D we welcome you :-)
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:22:22
i have much better advice for you... never comment ever again and delete this comment... by the time you want to cash the BTC someone is going to be knocking on your door and it wont be pleasant...
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:37:54
we are not going to ship until everything is sorted out. the Beer is for pickup until the shipping is sorted (as in putting it in cans) instead of bottles etc. we are discussing the logistics and welcome your input :-D i will get back to you with more information :-D
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:23:06
that would make sense.. i will think about it. i am full time programmer. i just do the marketing for the beer. :-)
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:23:25
i use skype mostly: danieltravolto is my nick there
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:00:16
just added.. thank you for the link
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:20:44
i am a bit dissappointed that you immediately want BTC for listing. basic listing should always be free
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:49:29
its not in austria or bavaria... but the legalities we will clear. thx for pointing that out Mr. LSD DMT :-D
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:49:20
btw, there will be a pub/restaurant attached to the brewery so everyone to pre-order will be more than welcome to come visit this beautiful region of Austria and get to know us personally :-)
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:40:20
for pre-orders of one bottle: 0.08 bitcoin to 1CHttHna7ZgHGmBqLbDhYmeQBXuV4M6Y67

thank you mrbluesky :-D

feel free to add it to  :-)
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:12:17
ah i see.. :-) thx for clearing that up... so you want to be more of a mentor or incubator
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:53:31
the mailing list subscription is working now on the website. just setting up the blog
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:53:03
feel free to add this to  :-)

i got $15 worth of bitcoins a few years back now its worth $500.
i am planning to buy several thousand in bitcoins
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:16:30
i really don't deserve this bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:19:57
one guy doing illegal stuff in some country like albania (he was running strip clubs and shit) .. send me some bitcoins in 2011.. i forgot about them and realized that they are worth something now... i bet this dude and some others like him are massively rich in bitcoins but dont talk about it because most of it is illegally made
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:22:55
we are going to start a pre-order for one bottle of beer :-) give me an hour or two to setup the mailing list, blog and all this stuff so as to start taking pre-orders
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:55:52
the first person reserved our original Austrian beer!  
Please let me know who it was by sending me a private msg on the exact time you made the purchase.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:50:14
actually quiet the opposite.. makes it 100% ad based
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:19:14
yes i understand this problem... i am still figuring out the technical aspect. one thing that i dont really understand is how i know who the transaction is from for example. with a few transactions thats no problem by personal contact but what do you do when there are many?
@_date: 2013-03-21 11:59:25
the brewery will start shipping the first beer end of 2013
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:43:56
that sounds like a fun idea... a great splash page immediately comes to mind.. we are sorting out details and then i think we might do that.great idea thank you
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:02:29
excellent idea
