Think use pool with supporting solo mining. It is like lottery, but with higger chance.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:44
I have open short positions. Please drop to zero :D
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:02:12
No one use it for payment? So I am realy only one? :D
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:32:42
Check bisq.network, there will be always some fee. But you can get low fee and no KYC.
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:51:49
They never can admit it. It will be treason.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:51:45
This is future of transfer value ;) They cannot stopped with lies. Because we know...
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:57:50
Sure, you are right. But if you cannot import asic miners to your country, but gpus yes? It is alternative way to get bitcoin with mining. If news is true and they do it for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:16:58
Good point ;)
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:20:07
Simple, more buy orders than sell orders.
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:55:52
1) They protect self from charge back funds
2) They protect you from hack. If somebody withdraw your coins. You have 10 days to save your funds.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:49:11
Maybe they mining shitcoins and trade tham for bitcoin. Result is same, only with cheap and available hardware.
@_date: 2018-09-16 06:38:43
yes, total coins can be increased by soft work if almost all nodes operators/miners will agree by updating to node with this change.

And than you say i will wait to next year for $800k. Inflation is good for currency. You need inflation or nobody will pay with.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:25:24
Sure, but question was about inflation. In few years will be few sathosi per block. This is no more problem. Because it is nothing. You dont need to wait years until last sathosi will be mined.
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:42:12
I am also fan of price stability. We need slow growth. Not crazzy wild wild west. The best scenario is growth will copy fiat inflation in oposit way.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:14:24
No sir, even in few years after couple halving will be almost all bitcoin already mined. You dont need to wait so long.
@_date: 2019-11-15 09:18:02
Yes, exit now please and entry again higher. This is best strategy how you put profit to ours pocket.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:06:21
Fiat exchange itbit.com (owned by Paxos, PAX USD stable coin, PAXG - Gold backed token), you get rebate -0.03% when limit maker order. So no fee and you even get paid for that trade.
@_date: 2019-03-05 10:54:18
Just one tip, do not use paper wallets generated online/offline for moving coins. There are to many stolen value last days.
@_date: 2019-03-17 17:50:53
And you can put limit orders on multiply support levels.
@_date: 2019-11-15 09:33:09
Are you trading on margin? This is why you get rekt at 8000? If yes, what is you money management strategy for trading? You need to know where you sell in loss already when you opening trade.
If you  hodl, why sell? If you buying only for profit and not fundamental value of bitcoin. Buy more every time when price drop. Than you can selling in profit every day.
@_date: 2019-03-12 06:39:37
Learn more about resistance and support levels in markets. This will help you understand.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:09:31
Electric version? :)
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:47:12
It is different, if you buy every month you can miss good discounts. Because price can drop and return to same levels. So this is why I wrote why is better buy on market movement and not time circle. Question was about if buy regulary every month for some budget. So yes you can buy every month for 100usd, or every little drop buy for 1usd. Then after month you can be sure your year average price will be more effecient.
@_date: 2019-10-14 17:39:30
In period. For examle each day, week, month, ...Dollar Cost Average strategy

There is no hardcap limit for unconfirmed trancastion. But can be confirmed only x transactions per 10min in block. This is aprox 3.5 er second.

Ok, so we now know where Sathosi is...
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:05:37
more speed = less secure and decentralized. So you can stay with fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:26:52
Sure, It was only note for fun. Not use it as real number.
@_date: 2019-02-13 14:44:35
Same with my full node. 
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:30:25
Best way for me is not cost averaging based on time, but price. Every time when price drop by 0.06%  I buy a peace of btc. I divide my budget to cover 20% drop. Than every month I increase budget so it is buing more and more with discounts. I do not need timing market. There are some services doing it for you. Or if you have skill you can run bot downloaded from github.
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:22:35
Do not buy all at once. Set limit orders on more price levels. When price drop it will buy more on with discount.
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:04:46
Guys we need people like him to prove bitcoin is secure and looking for weakness.
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:45:10
You can mine solo. Now when so much people run full node for lighting node. They can use USB miner 25Gh/s with 15W consuptions. Same as your HDD. You cannot profit from it only if you get so lucky. But you still running LN l. This will not harm your finance. And if this do so much people around world. Hash will be higher than from asic and their bussines will end. And network will be more secure. 
I think this is future. Super efective miners with very low consuptions, powered from green. Not for profit, but for securing network maybe even without knowing of user he is miner. Your led bulb can be miner with small hash. But there are so many bulbs in global... and so on...
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:27:33
They need start building new prisons for half of country citizens.
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:13:22
No, there is no inflation because max supply never change. They talk about inflation to current supply. But right angle is look from begining as complete bitcoin supply. 
So if you have now 1 butcoin, or after 10 years, have same bitcoin value because of max supply 21 million. 
Proppably value will be higher because every day somebody lost access to private key or send to wrong dead address
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:01:17

@_date: 2019-02-02 17:55:06
Why you think that actual state is final? There is still developing. Also you can use most simple wallet of sathosi for receive and send over LN. Install, open, receive/send thats all. You can use it in few seconds.
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:10:17
Because most of people are  to busy watching fake news with non existing problems, favorite tv show, nonstop working for pay their debts. So they dont have time thinkg about this biggest fiat scam.
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:12:30
Inbound capacity is very hard and expesive to get. If sombody open channel with your node you get inboud capacity easy and free. So they will need pepole provide tham liquidity.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:01:14
Do you know, even when nobody sell can price go lower?
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:02:55
Lighting network must solve problem with Inbound capacity. This will help with adoption.
@_date: 2019-12-10 11:34:41
Bitcoin failing only for those who are here to get quick rich.
@_date: 2019-12-16 07:24:25
Teach others about actual fiat system and why is bad for them.
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:02:48
Sure, big advantage if you open channel directly with exchange are also zero fee transactions to exchange.
It make sense if this will be condition.
@_date: 2019-12-20 18:58:55
BTC only as store wealth for next generations. For spending I use monero and xmr.to so I pay with BTC by this more anonymous way.
@_date: 2019-12-21 14:48:09
Yeah they have some future but it not easy. It cost fees and inbound capacity is small. This cannot get massive. Who will pay for it?
@_date: 2019-12-21 12:58:20
Exactly. But how can I get involve new user, when is for now without custodial imposible one click lightning wallet and send him sats.
There some project who open inbound capacity but I think this is limited solution. For massadoption who gets so many btc for many wallets inboud capacity and pay fees for opening channels? 
As you wrote, maybe it is not possible... but we will see.
@_date: 2019-12-10 11:46:32
Price will drop. Because is already in. And there will be panic sell like in LTC.
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:14:26
No magic. When stop loss happend, price go rapidly up or down. Depend if buy or short is liquidated on trading platmorm.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:43:31
If is unconfirmed  you can try do double spend with higher fee. Than this new transaction is confirmed first and old will never confirmed.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:21:21
To make it easy, imagine token for ask price 101 and buy price 99. If you manipulate with market if nobody selling/buying you put sell order to 100 from 101. Because market is in 99% automated with trading bots what will bot do if market tell him some body want sell for lower price?
Hmmm it is chance buy it for more lower price. And bot move buy price from 99 to 98. Ok let´s repeat it. Move to 99 from 100. Then buy side is moved from 98 to 97.
And so on...
So if nobody buy or sell price can change in both ways depend on trading bots strategies.
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:18:20
And maybe new ways will be discovered how to solve this. Fees or block size will rise someday. We will se what will win.
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:22:02
You can open more channels.
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:08:33
You are my guy.
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:19:13
Do you run full node 24/7? If yes, you must know why. If not, try it and you will get your answer.
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:29:41
Investing alone will not bring higher price in long term. Invest and help spread technology around you. With this you get your skin in game and only this way will bring mass adoption and your holdings will be rewarded.
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:11:42
Start  sync new node and stop when you will have data what you need.
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:33:28
Good choice do not trust with large amount.
We are on start with this technology.
One time even few satoshi can be large amount and you dont need stake a lot of btc to lightning.
Time will tell :)
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:02:36
And most important, they hold all crypto private keys. You must use their gateway. Because you have private keys only to binance.btc trash pseudo bitcoin. If you want withraw real bitcoin you can only with their gateway. So this is nonsense to use their "dex".

But, imagine you earning btc, have 0.1 and btc goes to moon 10x. But if they give you 400USD afer rise you get only 0.01BTC. So they take your future profit. It opossite they cover your losses. But hey, we are on bottom maybe. So why now before bull run?
@_date: 2018-11-08 12:11:08
I think no. Bitcoin have problem include even small features.

@_date: 2018-03-13 20:15:55
I agree with you. This is exactly place for bisq. But you need market makers on every exchange to have possibility any time buy or sell. But be market maker on bisq is so much expensive. So bisq need more people who just buying for itself to handle it without market makers. Thats is my point. I am market maker also on bisq, but because so much fees only with low volume. Thats all. Again I love bisq p2p it is best decetralized solution now.

Second Layer of bitcoin is not proof of work anymore. So why changing it?
In future when not be profitable mine for big players. Mining will return to ordinary people hands.
So much people will run own full node for LN channel. One profit is fee from LN and second with usb miner you can mine solo and win block with fees from that block. 
This setup can be run from small sollar panel. So you dont need mine for profit anymore. 
Problem is solved and network will be more sucure and decentralized than now.
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:56:02
Bisq.network for fiat and for crypto is better, faster, cheaper: crypto-bridge.com runing on bitshares.
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:48:00
Try bisq.network, more secure than local bitcoin. It is true decentralized p2p exchange.
Once you have btc, trade it. Buy low sell high. This make you great profits. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:14:34
It is not true, with new miners difficulty rise and all make less. It is same as PoS. In simple PoS working same as PoW. But your miner isnt HW but coin itself.For example So if you have 100coins it same as have miner with 100h/s.
PoS bonus is take time in stake as advantage. So even with low coin staked (small miner) you will one time found block. For older tx staked is difficulty lowered. This cant happen in PoW. So in this way is PoS more decentralized than PoW. Because even node with staked coin for 1USD will find block one time in future. Try it with some old miner. Your bills kill it.
We can argue about 51% attack. It depend on coin supply and coin price. Whe  price of coin and needed supply is lower than start 51% pow attack. Thaj pow is more secure. If oposite, PoS is more secure.
Just remember, full nodes make network stronger. No miners and stakers. This is why BTC lighting network bring so much security. Because you can stake your BTC to opening channel and make more btc with fees. More channeles more fees. So LN make from BTC also proof of stake model. 
I read article about in future BTC can be shift to LN completly with main chain no need anymore. Than you dont need miners only LN nodes. Gratz, BTC wil be completly PoS.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:03:03
I love idea of bisq, but until will be running on bitcoin network it is only for fiat trade. Do market maker with those high fees for every altcoins trade, it is killer. So if binance do somethink like bitshares. It will be massive 
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:38:14
Argue with rich get richer. It is same in PoW. More miners you have, more you make and can buy more...

I know reselaer where you can pay tesla with bitcoin in europe.
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:42:20
Dont worry, security by always good. For example on my full node I am mining solo with old usb erupter. I think one time in future every body will be also miner in small portion without even know he is miner. So I am not worry when big miners speculators will gone and mining get back to users. Not for profit, but for security and some chance win block with fees. Not reward anymore after few halvings.
But PoS is good. Not dPoS. Because we can have only few strong PoW networks. So PoS can solve altcoin security.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:50:43
I have so little thats no make sense to sell :) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:21:01
One think is sure, mining proof of work is dead end. No future as you wrote. It is wasting. This big power can help with finding cure on cancer for example. But money wins. They mining only for profit. We alredy have better ways than PoW, but still is using only because big money are invested and nobody want to loose. It is matter of time.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:38:35
But there is a lot of it still ready to mine. And mining in space from asteroids is very close. So infinite gold in space. So we will see about gold.

Did you try trade for example btc/ltc on bisq? You pay multiple times  (send to security deposit, send to user, send from multisgn address) network btc fee only in one trade. You need do big trades with big spread to cover this cost.

@_date: 2018-02-15 15:56:30
If you start,  you can try it with decentralized exchange. bitshares, openledger, crypto-bridge, all runing on bitshares. You controll keys and you can trade all the time. Also better fees. If you want trade for fiat, check Bisq.

Limited supply of gold is false. Maybe here on Earth. But in whole universe? We are so close start mining platinium and others metals in space. Than gold have no value becase those metals are better.
But with bitcoin you know on 100% you have limited supply in whole universe in our reality.
So if you saving for next generations than gold is no more good option.

@_date: 2018-12-28 10:53:01
Thanks for your opinion. Fees will be here also in future. When I buying on aliexpress I also pay fee for exchange my currency to another. I am using coinmate they have withrawal fee equal to btc transacrion on blochchain. But I agree, this can be better in furure when LN will be already implemented to exchanges. Or some another coin will be used for paying.

They can't stop .onion, but by force they can stop you by using it. Just google it. They have own TOR nodes so they get real IP address of you and sent SWAT team if you are criminal.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:25:06
FBI and others running own whole network public TOR servers. So you as client are hidden from your ISP provider. But they as running server and mixing traffic and IP. They know your IP. There is so many public cases  when they put to jail drog, child pedofild criminals based on that TOR tracking. How do you think was silk road shut down whe  was runned on TOR?
It is same like end to end encryption on whatsup and others. They can still read your message. They hold your private keys and running server that connect both sides. This is way how to fool criminals thinking they are safe and talk about crimes. Busted. 
It is only make you think you have more private. Bur you dont. If they running service. Encryption work only if you own private keys. Same like crypto. So you can be private...
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:08:36

You dont get my point. It can be for others 2 cents. Fot those you need private key? Sure you can but you will pay more on fees. I was answering on post how send 200 satoshi when fee is higer on main layer. You can do it with custody service. Thats all my message. Not about he must to do.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:51:39
Thats why lighting comming in. One time will be here more bitcoins, maybe all. Then fees are not problem.
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:55:16
Realy? He wrote about he dont have enough btc for fee. So you realy need for 200  sathoshi own private key? I dont think so. If I have in custody service like 20 USD I dont care about private keys. Sure for big ammiunt is is right way.

This post is about shutting down the website. Not directly people. Silkroad was running on the TOR and was shutted down. So telling TOR cannot be stopped is false. That's is what I want share.
Now to proof:
Option 1) 
Open  search engine, on TOR version better. (Google have big censorship, but maybe you found something) Start searching. You will found a lot of proof. I can do it for other and start post links. But why, someone still tell it is fake news, etc.
Option 2) (Better)
Start running own Tor Exit Node. Than check logs from node, and monitor tcp activity with wireshark. This will help anyone to see how you can start monitor network if you have a lot of Tor Exit nodes.
Yes you need more tech experience, but this will give you best proof.
So let anybody think what is best for him. Anybody have own free mind. I just representing my opinion based on my skills and experiences. I know how depresed can be for some one. So take it or leave it.
