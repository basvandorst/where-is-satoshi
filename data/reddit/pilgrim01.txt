Stop telling others what to do with their money.  Everything is an investment and risk including Federal Reserve Notes.  Federal Reserve Dollars have just a high of chance if not higher to go to zero.  Sure tell them Bitcoin is risky too.  Life is risky, but don't tell them not to invest what they can't afford to lose.  Everyone can afford to go all-in and lose it all.  Even then you are not going to die or starve to death.  Stop being a nanny-stater, next thing you will want to pass laws making it so people can't invest too much to keep them safe, get a life.

Yeah definitely check out cold storage, you will feel a lot better about your holdings knowing they are safe.  You can just keep smaller amounts in hot wallets for spending.  Or the great thing about Trezor, is you can spend directly from the device and keep them in cold storage at the same time.

Nice. Make sure to be security conscious. If using web wallet, use two-factor authentication for more security.  Use good passwords, don't use the same password for anything.  Secure your e-mail especially.
I suggest getting a real wallet where you hold your own private keys.  I recommend [electrum]( for a PC.  Just write down your 12 word seed phrase as a backup.  Or check out some mobile wallets if you have a smart phone.
If you want higher security or are holding significant amount of coins you better look into [cold storage](  Also check out [Trezor](  I highly recommend Trezor if holding large amounts of Bitcoin.  Also if you are interested check out paper wallets.  One way to make paper wallets is with [bitaddress](

Definitely host one if you can.  Nodes are important. I have heard recently the number of nodes is dropping.  The more nodes the better.  I am pretty sure more nodes help protect against attacks on the network.  They probably help with propagation times on the network as well. The more nodes there are, the more distributed and decentralized the system is, which makes it more robust.
I have heard if you really want to host a contributing node, you need to open port 8333 on your router, but you probably want to research it to figure exactly how to configure it for optimal performance.

You should check out some [wallets](  Try to use wallets where you hold your own private keys so you don't have to trust anyone to hold them for you.  I suggest [electrum]( for a PC, just write down the 12 word seed phrase when you set it up, and it serves as your backup.  Don't lose it, or you lose your coins forever and can never get them back.  Otherwise check out some mobile wallets, breadwallet is good for i-phone.  There are some good android wallets too.
Once you get a wallet and start to send some bits around, you will understand things a lot better.  Best way to learn is to jump right in.

VC's will fuel it.  They will pump the price when its time.  They are accumulating right now because the inflation is still high.  Its the distribution stage and they know it.  That is why VCs have dumped 400 million dollars into Bitcion startups.  The market cap is only $4.7 billion right now.  I have heard VC types say that if they decide its worth it they can pump the price up to huge levels to get the public interest in Bitcoin and hype it up.  It doesn't take much money to move this market.  If 400 million were poured into Bitcoin at market prices, the price would soar a lot.

Yes Bitcoin Core is the original client, but usually we don't recommend it to newbies, as it takes like 3 days to download the blockchain and it can be quite a turn off to new people.  Electrum there is no need to download the blockchain at all.
With Bitcoin Core, the proper way to backup your wallet is to open your wallet, then click file, then backup wallet.  Then save the backup to the location you desire, probably a flash drive or something.  The file will be called wallet.dat.  You can search your computer for the wallet.dat and save it that way, but sometimes an error could occur.  So its best to save it through the client itself.

Alt-coins are good, its always good to have competition in the market.  However once sidechains are implemented, its going to be very hard for alt-coins to compete and be successful on a large scale, which is why I am slightly bearish on alts. 
Some promoters of alts, like ethereum have accused Bitcoiners of being "Bitcoin maximalists" because we want sidechains to improve Bitcoin innovation and competition on top of Bitcoin.  What they don't realize is that we just want competition and innovation, and alt-coins are not going away.  They are just mad that its harder for them to compete and be successful if sidechains exist.  So they want to stop sidechains, so that their alt-coins like ehtereum will remain valuable.

FWIW [here]( is where I get my prediction from.  As you can see the 2nd bubble to $1163 occured just about exactly 6 months after the first bubble.  The second bubble was about 4 times as big.  If you want the chart to stay pretty and proportional, you could expect the next bubble to occur 24 months after the last, putting it at November 2015. 
Some thought the next bubble would occur 6 months after the 2nd one, but they were wrong.  If it occurs 24 months after, the charts would look prettier and it would make sense figuring that the volatility would be expected to go down over time as Bitcoin use spreads.

Yes there are 1 million bits in a Bitcoin.  Also sometimes people use mBTC, which 1 BTC = 1,000 mBTC   and 1 mBTC = 1000 bits.

@_date: 2014-12-12 12:01:09
No it doesn't really mean it costs 3 dollars.  Perhaps now in a way it does.  But over time the halvings will occur.  Remember right now is the distribution phase.  One of the obstacles Satoshi had when creating Bitcoin was distributing the coins in a fair way.  The reward does not have to be so high in order to secure the network.  The main reason the reward is so high right now is because we are still in distribution, and inflating by about 10% per year.
@_date: 2014-12-12 06:51:49
If they are in coinbase, then really Coinbase is storing them for you.  You don't really own Bitcoin, you only own a promise to pay you Bitcoin.  Get a wallet where you control your own private keys, and then you will be a Bitcoin owner.
But actually even then, nobody owns their bitcoins actually.  They own a key that unlocks them and allows them to be transferred on the public ledger, which is just as good as owning the Bitcoins.
If using a PC, check out [electrum](  You don't have to download the whole blockchain as with Bitcoin Core.  Just write down your 12 word seed as backup, its a one-time backup.
If using a smart phone, check out [bread wallet]( for i-phone, or try [Andreas Shildbach's wallet]( for Android. Also maybe look at [mycelium]( they have a good local trader option in their app as well.
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:59:58
Not sure the best way to do this.  But possibly you could try extracting the master public key from the wallet.  To do that you enlarge electrum to the whole screen.  Then click wallet &gt; Master Public Key.  Then copy your key and restart electrum fresh again.  Then use the Master Public Key to create a watch only wallet.  This will import all of your addresses but not your private key.  From there I am not sure what to do, but perhaps you could craft the raw transaction and save it, then sign it offline, then broadcast it.
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:39:48
This happened when paypal said they were accepting Bitcoin too, then the price crashed soon after.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:09:18
Yeah we are still inflating at over 10% per year, not even factoring in lost or destroyed coins. Its still the distribution phase.  But soon in July 2016 we will have the next halving, which will greatly reduce the downward pressure on the price.

You will just go to your electrum receive tab and then copy one of your addresses.  Then go to your Coinbase account, and then paste the electrum address into your Coinbase account send field.  Then just type the amount you want to send, and click to send them to your electrum wallet.  I don't think Coinbase charges any fee to transfer.  Usually there is a miners fee of 0.0001 btc per transaction, but Coinbase pays it for you.
Coinbase and electrum aren't really connected, because in reality no company owns Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is like an open source protocol.  Its kind of like nobody owns e-mail.  You can set e-mail up on your own, but also there are companies like yahoo, and gmail that host it for you if you want it to be easier.  
But with freedom comes responsibility so make sure to take security seriously.  If you are thinking of holding a significant amount of Bitcoins, I would really recommend a Trezor to keep them safe, unless you are tech savy enough to figure out cold storage.  Check out my links above, they will help out.
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:09:10
I think his problem lies more in the fact that he can't sign a transaction unless electrum searches the blockchain to find the coins there. Therefore he may have to craft the transaction in a watch-only wallet that is connected to internet.  Then save the transaction and sign it offline.  Then broadcast it online.
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:29:30
Yeah sure.  Bitcoin uses public key/private key cryptography.  Each address that holds bitcoin is essentially your public key.  The private key is a secret that you don't reveal to anyone.  The private key is used to sign transactions, which are then broadcast to the network, and then locked into the blockchain by miners. If anyone gets your private key(s) they can steal your coins.
So when you get a wallet, its a good idea to backup the private keys, or in electrum's case a "seed phrase" made of 12 words.  The seed can be used to create all of the private keys and addresses for that wallet.  Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets use seeds usually in the form of a 12 or 24 word phrase as the backup.  Its good to backup your keys in case your hard drive crashes or you accidentally delete your keys, or if your device gets lost or stolen.
To really get good security of your private keys, its recommended to use [cold storage]( or a hardware wallet like [Trezor](  Also there are paper wallets, one way to make paper wallets is with [bitaddress](
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:32:50
Perhaps Trezor will have QR code scanning capability in the future.  It would be cool if instead of NFC, it used some type of radio broadcasting method.  But perhaps we need more development and infrastructure built for that.

I agree with you.  Its not just about buying and holding.  For me its about switching.  Switching from a scam fiat based system to one that promotes freedom and fair money.  This means promoting the better system as well. Its important to use Bitcoin, accept it for goods and services, spend it, and give it away.  Being bold means having the guts to say goodbye to an old corrupt system and trying for something better even when it is untested and unproven.  It means contributing with your unique talents to the community.  Some will be coders/developers, some will be traders, some will be educators, some will just be holders.  We all have our role.  Yes we may lose, but at least if we lose, we lost while daring greatly and striving towards progress.  At least we weren't cowards.

94,000 coins are produced every 26.1 days by mining alone.  So if the auction doesn't happen for 4 weeks, then the amount dumped will actually be double at 188,000 coins released onto the market.  So maybe you should be even more concerned ;)
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:06:02
Yeah sure...they are kind of safe at coinbase.  Coinbase is a reputable company in the USA, and regulated and all that jazz.  But your coins would be safer if you take control of the funds yourself by holding your private keys.  You never know if the government is going to shut down Coinbase, or what could happen.
With Bitcoin, every address is associated with a private key.  Its cryptography. You get a public key which is your address, and a private key which controls the funds by signing for that address.  The private key is kept secret because if someone gets it, they can steal your bitcoins.  The public key is public, because others need to know your address to send you Bitcoins.
Coinbase has an option called the vault, where they use a split, multi-signature scheme.  This means they split the 1 private key into 3 keys.  They keep one, and give you two of the keys.  It requires 2 of the 3 to unlock it.  If you keep your coins as Coinbase, this is a much safer option to use their "vault" option.
To set up a private wallet on a PC, just go to  then follow the directions for whatever Operating System you have.  Once you set it up, it gives you a list of 12 words.  Write them down on paper and don't lose them.  You can use those 12 words to restore your wallet, its called a seed, because it can be used to create all of your addresses/private keys for that wallet.
Once you get it set up, click the receive tab and you will see a list of your receiving addresses.  Try to use a new address everytime you make a transaction, it helps for privacy and security.  You can always generate more addresses over time.  To send, just get someone else's address and send the coins to their address under the send tab.
Also you should check out [cold storage]( for more security over your wallets.  Also there are hardware wallets like the [Trezor](  It allows you to hold bitcoins on the Trezor device, and sign transactions completely offline, which makes it basicaly impossible for hackers to steal your keys.  Trezor is the gold standard for security and is also really simple for newbies.  Overtime hardware devices will probably get a lot cheaper to buy.
Edit:  You can also check out paper wallets.  One way to make paper wallets is to use [bitaddress](

I don't know how much it helps the network overall unless you open port 8333 on your router and run a full node 24/7.  You will want to get up to more than 8 connections.
You may not want to do that depending on many things.  Also you should know if you are holding coins in your wallet, when you run a full node you are basically broadcasting your IP to the world, and telling them that you are a Bitcoin person.  This could make you vulnerable to hacking attempts.  To really help the network you need to run the node all the time.
If you just want an easier to use wallet, try [electrum](  
But yes to answer your questions, for Bitcoin Core, you can shut it down whenever you want, and when you open it up again it will just catch up by downloading any new blocks.  You just won't be able to send any coins until you catch up the download past the block where your coins were transacted in.

Online Poker is perfectly legal in the USA.  The only thing that was made illegal, was being a money transferrer for gambling sites. This was a result of the UIGEA bill.  Poker is a skill game and not gambling, but overzealous prosecutors in the southern district of New York don't care about that either. 
The reason PokerStars left the US market, was they got harrassed by the Feds and they along with players got millions of dollars stolen from their bank accounts.  Their owner Isai Schienberg got indicted, and faced jail if he ever set foot in the USA.  
For this reason they will likely never allow USA players ever again.  However it may be possible to VPN in to play, and it will be easier to withdraw Bitcoin than FIAT.
Bitcoin is good for poker sites because it allows them to bypass the banking system, and thus bypass the dangers caused by UIGEA regulations.
Edit:  Also I would like to note that it is not totally because of the UIGEA that PokerStars got in trouble.  What happened was the regulators put such onerous regulations on the banks, that banks refused to deal with PokerStars or other Poker sites because they were afraid to get in trouble, even though Poker is not really gambling.  Poker is a skill game which is legal in most states across the USA.  But the banks were afraid, and this left PokerStars and other companies with very few choices, so they had to bend the rules a bit to get their transactions to go through.  They even partnered with a small bank specifically to deal with poker transactions.  This bending of the rules was seized upon by the Feds to charge PokerStars and their banking partners with money laundering and other crimes.

Using Bitcoin for i-tunes seems like it would be good.
@_date: 2014-12-14 04:42:13
Well that is a common misconception.  There are many ways to answer this.  For one, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, and the code.  Its backed and secured by cryptography. Its decentralized meaning no governments need to back it, because it is backed by we the people.  Its hard for people to grasp at first, because a money like this has never existed before.
Also some say Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, which is wrong.  Bitcoin has incredible intrinsic value.  For one it is a payment mechanism that can send money around the world with a click of a mouse.  Its also a public ledger, which can be used for many things besides money.
You could also tell your dad that dollars aren't backed by anything either.  The main advantage of Bitcoin as a money is that it is not controlled by a small group of powerful people like dollars are. Perhaps your dad thinks these powerful corrupt men are what backs dollars? The Federal Reserve prints the dollars our of thin air, and they have [tripled the money supply]( since the 2008 bailouts.  Fiat money is a scam and vulnerable to corruption, which steals wealth from the people.  Bitcoin is an honest and fair system that could replace the Federal Reserve.  Code and mathematics can't be corrupted as easily as some old men in suits.

You can get bitcoins with cash sure.  There are a lot of ways to buy Bitcoin.  In the USA coinbase.com and circle.com are two good ways to buy them with a bank account.  Also you can buy them off of localbitcoins.com using many methods including in person transactions with cash.
You don't have to buy a full bitcoin.  One bitcoin right now is $360.  Bitcoins are broken down to 8 decimal places. So you can have 0.00000001 BTC. Sometimes we use bits or mBTC instead.  There are 1000 mBTC in a BTC, and 1 million bits in a BTC.
You will need a wallet to hold your bits before transferring to microsoft.  I suggest using [electrum](  You don't have to download the full blockchain with electrum, so its super fast to set up and good for beginners.  Just write down your 12 word seed phrase when setting it up as your backup.  If you lose your wallet or your hard drive crashes, you can restore it using the seed phrase.  But if you lose the seed phrase you lose your coins forever.  There is no Bitcoin CEO to call to get your coins back.
Welcome to Bitcoin, and welcome to freedom.

Yeah well Pokerstars is now owned by a gaming company called Amaya since this summer, so maybe things have changed.  I really hope they would allow US players, but it just seems unlikely.
Back when the Feds seized Scheinberg's money, they forced him to sign agreements promising to never serve US customers again.  If he didn't agree then the feds wouldn't give some of the money back that belonged to the players.  So if he broke the agreement it might get him in hot water again, and put attention on their site again.  The risk probably outweighs the reward for PokerStars.
So as usual, it doesn't matter what the real law is, all that matters is what the bully feds will do to you.  Right now Stars has a huge player base and no other poker site will ever come close to its size anytime soon, so they don't want to risk losing that.

I would be careful using HD wallets because who knows if your master public key is leaking out with the way electrum/trezor operates.  If anyone can compromise just one of your HD addresses' private key, and they get your master public key as well, then it seems they get your whole wallet.

Bitcoin works by using a public ledger called the blockchain.  The Bitcoin transactions are locked into the ledger about every 10 minutes on average by a process called mining.  People are using very fast computers to verify the transactions and secure the network and the ledger.  Every time a miner finds a block, they are rewarded with 25 bitcoins.  Today you need special ASIC devices to mine profitably.
Bitcoin is accepted at many stores and the list is always growing.  For example, Overstock.com, Dell, Expedia, Dish Network, TigerDirect, NewEgg.  Paypal will be implementing it soon as well.  Also you use it on many gambling and poker sites.  You can use gyft.com to buy gift cards for Bitcoin at many places like Burger King, Home Depot, Target, Sears, etc...
For changetip, just go to changetip.com and link your reddit account to changetip.  You don't need to sign anything up or give e-mail or password or anything.  Its just like two mouse clicks to link your account up.  Then it will collect any tips automatically.  You can then withdraw the bitcion tips to your own wallet.

Cool, which wallet software are you running?  There are a lot of different ones.  With electrum it gives you a 12 word seed phrase when you make the wallet.  Since electrum is an HD wallet, you only need to back it up one time by saving your seed phrase.  With Bitcoin Core its a little more difficult, you need to save more often about every 100 transactions to be safe.  Also electrum is good because you don't need to download the whole blockchain which can take several days now.
Whatever wallet you use, I would find out the proper way to make a backup, as saving the home directory may or may not do it properly.
