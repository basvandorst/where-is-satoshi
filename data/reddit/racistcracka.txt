Nahh...they've been wanting bigger blocks for years.  You guys are whacko.  Buncha nutcases.  I love you though.  It's great how you're destroying bitcoin--so cool.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:44:28
Seriously you should sell this so I can buy it and run a Bitcoin Unlimited node on it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:22:19
Miners have wanted bigger blocks now for YEARS.  Can't see how that would help their supposed high fee desires.   Only one group wants to keep the block size low for whatever reason.
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:13:22
Seriously I want to shill for you guys.  How much does Blockstream pay you?  Do I have to give you a cut of my profits per post or anything?
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:33:47
Well bitcoin already changed their supply.  It used to be 184 billion, lol.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:22:56
Look man...I'm serious you guys pay me and I'll say the same bs to people.  
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:09:09
Sending coins cheaply.  It's much faster than bitcoin.  Turns out it's a better store of value since the block size was restricted too.  Also, they are getting sidechains so they can have a sidechain like bitcoin where everyone argues while blockchain tech passes them by...oh it'll be real expensive too.

Why do folks lie about this?  By 5189, the projected supply of Eth is 103,862,556.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:01:22
Segwit's not a bigger block.  That's just what Blockstream wants.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:28:22
No, all you guys are shills and I want IN.   Seriously, give me some of those Blockstream dollars and I'll say what you're saying--same deal you get.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:57:01
Eth is half the size of bitcoin now and growing.  The fees are MUCH cheaper considering that.  As far as security goes, I'll take Eth security over bitcoin any day.  One bitcoin fanboy subreddit where they repeat two things over and over doesn't really say much.  lol  
As far as faster chains go...so...that's why Ethereum is implementing sidechains.  lol 2
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:09:47
Lol activity.  You realize they aren't talking about processing transactions there right?  
Your examples are absurd.
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:28:52
Eth doesn't get inflated to infinity.  That is a lie.   The projected supply by the year 5189 is 103,862,556.  
Ethereum currently scales FAR better than Bitcoin AND rootstock...so what!?  It's DOA.  Ethereum can do sidechains too.  Bitcoin's goose is cooked.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:12:30
Man...I just want in like the bros pushing Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:00:43
You are...the other guys contacting me are getting referral fees.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:39:16
Miners want bigger blocks.  They've been begging for it.  Segwit is not bigger blocks.  It's what the side that pays you wants.  You're in here all the time.  Gotta be getting paid them fat checks.  
Hey, in all seriousness, I'll push for Segwit too if you get your boys to pay me.  I can be real effective at it.  I admire you guys for what you're doing.  It's classic.  PM me if you want me to help destroy bitcoin too and will pay me.  Being dead serious too.  I'll delete these comments if you guys pay me.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:16:20
Bro..you're doing it.  I can too!
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:03:05
Man I'm trying to get paid like you.  I want the big bucks though.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:54:09
Bro...let's cut through the bs.  PM me.  Let's get this going.  I can do what you do but better.  Do you get referral fees from Blockstream like the others?
