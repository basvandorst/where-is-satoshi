No idea, don't have any alts.. I would assume you get a recovery seed for every alt wallet you install. When you get it make sure you update it using the ledger manager if it doesn't have the latest software. Then you can add remove altcoin wallets as you please. They really made everything as user friendly as a secure hardware wallet can get atm.

Thought the ledger seemed more user friendly and just better build quality. So far they have proven to be the better choice in supporting (coin that i can not name) so I could dump it.

They dropped bitcoin to focus 100% on mobile payments instead, the CEO later said that he thinks bitcoin will be dead in 5 years.

Ahh, didnt know this. I wonder why they keep their bitcoin if they/he think its going to fail.
