Roger Ver might be a narcissistic cryptomaniac, but It's vocal and competitive people like him that will keep the Bitcoin core development team alert, fresh , motivated and fighting for the competitive edge. I'd guess that almost every dev team out there has a goal of winning the cryptocurrency race and only a few will, and only time will tell.

At maximum adoption bitcoin will turn from parabolic to linear. Around 2050. At linear growth (purely from lost coins) it will be very predictable and will turn into a pure stablecoin. Speculation will cease at this point. The only exception is if the premined coins are moved, that will have some temporary impact.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:57:54
I think you underestimate the customer. They want fast, easy, and convenient, and the winner coin will have all those properties, in addition to being secure and decentralized. In the meantime, as I stated, Bitcoin can fall off because it lacks customer friendliness. That's why I quoted the article that talks about winners having a "Whole product" focus.

The block size is 1MB. Segwit reduces the actual bytes in transactions, but only slightly. (More transactions can fit into the 1MB block) Instead of building extra lanes on the highway, like BCASH did by increasing the block size, they split the lanes and made the cars width shorter. It only works in the short term, as traffic (transactions) rise exponentially.

We are witnessing evolution of cryptocurrency. The winner is the one which is best suited for mass adaptation in our current and evolving society.

Right. There is no quick fix. That's why we need a fool-proof second layer.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:31:32
Scaling to Visa level is impossible with blockchain without a second layer or child chains, so there is that, and there are several startups that are working on different solutions to that problem, both POW and POS, still my point is, if Bitcoin don't deliver within a certain timeframe, someone else will. I don't think that is too hard to understand, except if you are too heavily invested monetarily or perhaps idealistically.

You'd never know.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:05:03
Nah, I know for sure it won't be a major correction, because as soon as the dip is more than 5% coinbase goes down and no one is able to sell. (hodlers don't use coinbase, only diaper wearing hobby investors.) By the time coinbase is back up again, the price goes up, and coinbase goes down again, until it's back to normal.

Is answering a question with assumptions your kind of logic?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:13:42
What they own and what they will add to coinbase doesn't necessarily have any correlation.
They had a [questionnaire in january]( I think. 
Things has changed by then, and they need to be concerned with regulatory compliance, so privacy coins will probably be hard to implement. My guess is ripple and/or iota, maybe dash.

By burning bitcoins you actually distribute that wealth to every other coin owner, so not exactly the same as throwing it away.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:06:18
People buy bitcoin now because it's a rocket and they want to get rich, so in the short term expect BUY AND HODL.
After awhile when cryptocurrency gradually becomes accepted as payment at any store there will be a big shift.
The big shift is when people have no use for fiat anymore and they demand their salary in cryptocurrency. 
That future is still a couple of decades away. We are still in the infancy of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

The futures are tools for miners to reduce risk, not tools for wall street as means for marked manipulation. No need to worry. The bitcoin price will live it own life, regardless of the futures marked. It's still risky tho.

*Betamax was the first successful consumer video format, and at one time it had close to 100% of the market. All of the video machines in use and all of the pre-recorded movies were Betamax.

Decentralized also means, do not keep all your funds in one cryptocurrency in one single address, created by one method, controlled by one private key, created on one computer, with you in one state of mind, with one frame of reference and with you in one state of security knowledge.
You evolve, so should your concerns with privacy and cryptocurrency security. Decentralize all the way down to 1 satoshi at millions of addresses, maybe not that far, but you get the point.
