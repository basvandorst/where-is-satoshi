There's always a group of people that simply view cars as a tool to get from point a to point b. It is a shame in my opinion, given how much entertainment cars provide me.
But perhaps he finds something else exhilarating that I find boring *shrug*

Look at ASICMINER. In many cases it makes sense to sell your hardware for a large portion of what it could earn over its lifetime, and reinvest your immediate profits into next-generation hardware. In some cases, ASICMINER was able to sell hardware for more than it could realistically earn. I was stoked, as an ASICMINER shareholder.

I turned a profit but only out of sheer luck of selling my blade shortly after purchasing it. I doubt the guy who bought it from me was able to turn a profit.

I just spent ~$3500 on Amazon using Gyft cards. I bought a $2000, $1000, and $500 gift card. With the 3% back, the $500 gift card cost me $410. Took me about 10 minutes to figure out Gyft. Not too bad compared to BTC -&gt; Coinbase -&gt; Bank,

No, he is correct. 7 GH/s with a very efficient chip will earn more than it consumes in power, hence being profitable. 10 GH/s with a power hungry chip will consume more power than it earns, hence being unprofitable.
Not sure why used the random hashrates 7 and 10 GH/s and deemed one of them profitable and the other not.

I'm curious about the potential profits to be made after accounting for the fraud attempts. It is my understanding that the Paypal EULA does not permit the selling of currency(if BTC is a currency is debatable) but selling a piece of paper to someone is legal. Not sure if Paypal would side with the seller though in the case of a buyer complaining about "not receiving goods".

Yup, and difficulty has increased dramatically since my post. I love my ASICMINER shares but I still hold that their Block Erupters are overpriced. I'm now looking to dump my ASICMINER blade with the expected price halving cutting it's worth in half overnight.

My understanding is that CampBX is doing a best attempt at being 100% legal. I'm sure they would be happy to explain things further.

ASICMINER(AM) shares are in no way tied to the USD exchange rate for BTC. AM share price is tied to their performance(BTC-based dividends). You can see examples of this with the price skyrocketing right before a large dividend is expected. I believe the price is also climbing as more people are introduced to AM and haggle over a limited number of shares. 
The only factor that affects AM performance is BTC's difficulty. Even if the BTC/USD price spikes, difficulty won't spike as quickly and AM's income will follow the difficulty. This goes with their USB and blade miners as well. They are priced in BTC at the limit of what the market will accept. I imagine in the coming weeks/months we'll see another auction to establish a new price for the blades and USB miners.
edit: I think the term you were searching for is ROI-return on investment.

Same but summer is coming around for me. I am hoping that this Fall the prices for ASICs will have dropped sufficiently that I can heat my apartment with waste heat again. Not sure what I'll do next summer though but I'll cross that bridge then.

If PayPal enters the btc payment industry I wouldn't be surprised if they just bought out Bitpay or some similar company that has the expertise PayPal needs. In a few years, Bitpay for a few ten-hundred million dollars might be a bargain for companies like PayPal.

Did anyone say that the cube was second gen chips? I thought rumor was ~3 blades + backplane in a convenient case.

Low power usage and ease of maintenance. I mine with ~5 GH/s of HD 5970s and I'm going to try to purchase two of these and shutdown my HD 5970s. 2500w of heat versus 200w of heat is going to be incredible for the summer.

If you own 51% of the hashing power then you can create a fork of the blockchain where you control what transactions go into the blockchain. My understanding is that it doesn't take 51% of the hashing power but you simply need to consistently solve enough blocks such that your fork becomes the primary fork. So maybe something in the 30-50% range? I don't know the specifics, just the general idea.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:01:32
Do you say that because of the size of the network? If that is the case then I would disagree. In my opinion a 51% attack is still relatively cheap at only a few(5-10?) million USD. Network security will occur when it is cheaper to attack BTC through legal means than a hardware attack. I imagine when we hit the a few petahash/second we will be moderately secure. The real test will be the second wave of ASICs. The hashing densities available at 20-28nm versus 65nm(BFL), 130nm(ASICMiner), and 110nm(Avalon) will cause the network to skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:56:03
I really hope that CampBX can manage to toe the line and stay in business. They have a nice platform and the potential to become a major exchange for BTC. It is comforting knowing that there is an exchange out there taking this thing seriously.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:56:43
In ASICMiner's defense, they ship now. I purchased a blade and received in 4 days after paying for it. If you purchase a BFL 5 GH/s Jalapeno(or whatever they call them these days) you do not know when you'll receive it.
That being said these are overpriced in my opinion. Had they been close to 1 BTC I would have considered buying up 9 to fill out a powered USB hub. They might generate 1 BTC in the next 4-6 months, maybe.

I can't tell if you are being serious or sarcastic. Plenty of 3rd world countries have fantastic cellular networks. All you need is a phone with a web connection and you're set. Who cares if the latency is 500ms so long as the connection works.
@_date: 2013-02-21 18:43:28
I would discourage this. At the current difficulty 1 GH/s is estimated to generate a block in 181 days. Coming from a guy with 8 GH/s of GPUs, stay on a PPS pool and wring every last BTC out of those GPUs. Then off to litecoin!
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:16:48
Ah, been in that situation before. Just be careful, your parents may question why the power went up $100/month and not realize it was you. Keep your eyes peeled on Newegg for openbox or sales on GPUs. Even a little HD 7870 will generate decent coin and permit you to shutdown your power hungry CPUs.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:12:38
They already run a few terahash/second of ASICs. Selling their hardware benefits BTC by 1) making the network stronger 2) making BTC easier to acquire/understand. Both of these make their current investment stronger.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:53:25
Hash-rate doesn't matter. Your percentage of the network is what matters. Right now a GPU earns more BTC by mining LTC and then exchanging for LTC than it earns by mining BTC. This will continue as ASICs increase their percentage of the network.
@_date: 2013-05-22 02:29:18
Keep in mind that difficulty is skyrocketing every two weeks. So those 3.6 BTC/month will be more like 3 BTC/month for the first month, 2.4 BTC for the second month, and continuing down the line. Also, if you order your BFL 5 GH/s miner you might get it within 4-6 months from now. By then it might break even in 6-12 months due to difficulty or 3 months or 2 years. 
It is a bad time to buy anything due to all of the uncertainty in upcoming difficulty. BTC ASICs are a gamble in my opinion. If you have the money, gamble away and you could potentially make a bundle.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:58:31
I would investigate mining LTC and converting your LTC to BTC via an exchange. Last I checked(yesterday) you saw about a 60% higher return doing this. The volatility of BTC prices could affect this however.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:11:32
I only care in that I'm waiting for the inevitable crash to secure more BTC. My mining endeavors provided the best capital returns on any investment I've made. I am now hoarding and buying at what I unscientifically consider to be opportunistic times.Sure, I could get burned if BTC crashes and fades but even if all my BTC disappeared I'd still consider myself ahead.
It's been a crazy roller coaster these past 2 years and I hope it continues.

I can't tell if you're being serious or making a joke. BitSynCom == Avalon. Avalon is just the name of the product. Don't be surprised if BitSynCom releases another product line using the technology developed for Avalon.

Due to the block size limits there are a limited number of transactions that can be inserted into a block. If the active BTC community spikes in size we will bounce off this block size limit. Good for miners in that users who want instant confirmation will pay higher transaction fees. Bad for users as it'll take hours to confirm a transaction. 
I believe there is discussion to increase the block size, who knows if that'll happen before we constantly hit the block size limit.

I run a btc node + p2pool instance in a VM on my desktop. So far it's worked out well although watch out on the amount of diskspace needed if you start to throw alt-coin instances. Ran out of disk space with btc/ltc/trc and had to do some fancy juggling to grow the vm.
@_date: 2013-05-24 22:41:57
If the USD/BTC exchange rate were to spike, in theory the difficulty would follow as more miners fired up whatever equipment available to get some of that sweet Internet money. Due to the difficulty rising, sales of the hardware would most likely dip after the initial surge as the ROI hits a period of time that is considered risky. 
ASICMINER might then hold another round of auctions to renegotiate the price. At this new price point it is possible that ASICMINER could pull in even MORE BTC due to volume. Depending on the spike in price, ASICMINER's fiat costs compared to their BTC generation may go up or go down but I think we all agree that ASICMINER is making a killing on selling hardware.

I rented a garage and had no issues with the power consumption spiking from my pulling ~6 kW. Expensive powerbill but no questions were asked but I suspect 6 kW is just a drop in the bucket/not worth investigating. Maybe if I rented an industrial location, had more power brought in and then started pulling insane amounts of power in grow operation cycles I'd have raised some suspicions. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:06:01
Good lord.. you are using more USD in power than you are generating. Definitely not profiting from this unless you have 'free power'. I wouldn't even bother with BTC unless you in the GH/s range. For GPUs look at LTC, immensely more profitable. Plug your hashrates into a calculator -&gt; [dustcoin]( and see what is profitable.

I firmly believe that we will see BTC ASIC prices crash by this fall. Right now ASICMiner is selling their devices for the price that the market will tolerate. This is great news to me as an ASICMiner shareholder. Bad news as a miner looking for more gear.

I plan on mining Litecoin for 2-3 months until winter ends and the 2.5 kW/hr of heat I'm currently generating is no longer a useful by-product. By then I'll have around 10k LTC and I'll just archive the VM with that wallet and come back in a few years. If Litecoin is worthless then the gamble failed to pay off but my apartment remained nice and toasty and I had fun while doing it. If Litecoin appreciates even slightly then the gamble paid off and I'll buy myself something nice or hoard even longer.
So yes, this idiot is going after Litecoin with the goal of rolling the digital dice. I've made my money in BTC, time to diversify.

Right now most of the pass-through providers do not charge a fee. TAT charges 5% on his 100:1 PT. So, whatever Friedcat(BitFountain) delivers as a dividend per share you get. I'm not sure what the various exchanges charge for fees for buying/selling shares but if you are buying to hold then that isn't a serious issue.
