I think it is miners spamming BCH mempool to increase fees the same way they do with BTC mempool.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:55:39
I've read this post. And t seems as an interesting idea that if block size limit is removed then this kind of attack vector will not work and miners will adjust their max block sizes themselves according to orphan rates of the blocks they produce.

SegWit is a low level tech. Customers do not know about such things. He should understand that. 
I'm pretty sure customers demand fast and relible service. Which should translate in his head to SegWit as a technology that could provide speed ad reliablity.
Saying such a crap publicly reveals ether he is dumb or does not realy care.
If I would be an owner of coinbas I would fire that kind a CEO asap.

That's because SHA1 collision is a hypothetical danger in the feature. CloudFlare is happening right now!

Current implementation is a hack AFAIK. And has a limited scaling properties.

Segwit is a good idea. But I think it is better implement it as a hard fork.

Unexpected behavior /s

I have not read all of this, since I'm not smart enough to understand the algo, but I'm all for rewarding node runners.
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:35:31
This kinda worrying.  
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:15:36
I think 2MB hard fork is much safer then change of PoW algo. I believe 95 of miners will accept 2MB + SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:38:14
5 days ago I recovered my old wallet and found 1 coin in it. After that I made this transaction to my new wallet: 
I thought I would wait a very long time for confirmation, but it was confirmed within seconds by BitFury.
That was unexpected.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:31:32
Why miners do not want SegWit?
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:06:31
And after this merge I would not be able to do that?
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:07:51
Have you promoted your solution?
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:46:18
As I understand they have succeed to find private keys via brut force. Are my funds safe? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:35:32


That is smart and safe in term of split. No miner will continue mining if his blocks are getting orphaned.

We do not trust any of them, but we trust them all.

I think the price will drop almost instantly as people will move their funds to other crypto since Bitcoin will became fiat at that point.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:02:16
This kind a change undermine the scarcity of Bitcoin and that will work against the price. I think it is not in the best interests of miners.
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:07:30
That was scary 
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:04:33
The truth is: miners always have been in control of block size. For 8 years. Why should not they stay in control?
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:02:15
You are right, split will play against the price heavily. 
As I understand the author, it leaves not much space for a split with the proposed scenario, since all unupgraded miners will be forced to bigger block camp first.
The split can happen if core will change PoW in respond to orphaning nonupgraded miner's blocks.

I mean, miners decide the size of the block. They did it just fine for 8 years.
Edit: typos.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:58:28
When i said we had not block limit, I meant we never hit it - so never felt it is there.

Miners decide what to put in the block - they are in control of the size. And until now they just never hit the ceiling.

Blockchain.info  API?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:52:59
Well, that's a possibility.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:30:25
I think 1250 is the ceiling with the current TPS limit. And we will bounce up and down until TPS is fixed.

Yes, it's the russian guy that sells and buys bitcoins in the village. I think it is him, who set up everything for them to accept bitcoins.

I think that the BIP about block size limit is basically a poll with a question:
**Do you think that current 1Mb block size is too big?**
* Yes.
* No, I would like to have 1Mb or bigger blocks.
If it will be implemented, we will see what percent of full node runners support Luke-jr' statement:

As I understand if miners do not support SegWit, SegWit could be pushed as hardfork.

It's important to understand, that bitcoin is heavily used for illegal substance trafficking in Moscow on the local darkmarket. People in power are profiting of this business since they control most of the cocaine and heroin supply chains, as I know.

There is a shortage of transactions, sinse many exchanges halted withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-01-15 05:51:05
I think that without miners support on SegWit hardfork is highly possible.
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:00:11
I'm in India now, Goa. My feelings are: people with tons of cash (Lets call them rich) are looking for people with little cache (Lets call them poor) and asks them to deposit to their banks accounts some money. One person can deposit up to 250 000 Rs without paying any tax. 
But the problem is that the poor man can ran away with the deposit and there is no way to quickly withdraw it with new banknotes. One of the solutions is to transfer the money to an exchange from the poor's man account and buy gold or bitcoins.

Two considerations:
1. What about people which will not opt int for SegWit? Is it a block size increase for them?
2. It is not about what SegWit is, it is about what people want. Some want SegWit, some bigger blocks. Blockchain is for everybody.

Thank you for a great job.
I think it would be interesting to test the scenario when 95% of nodes (users) open up to 3 channels with the rest of nodes (hubs). That would give us more realistic topology.
After that, users would start sending payments to each other.

No worries. Your life is becoming shorter and shorter every second.  So you are getting richer per second.
@_date: 2017-07-09 04:15:36
I agree with you on that.
One more thing have come to my mind. 
At this moment we have about 15% oh hash power opposing SegWit in any form. Lets assume that SegWit has been activated and everybody mimes the SegWit chain. Coins started to flow to SegWit addresses. 
After some time those opposing miners make a hard fork and stop enforcing SegWit rules on a new chain. Which means all SegWit coins on that chain are anyone can spend now and miners take them.
If at the moment of the fork I have my coins on non-Segwit address - I will have coins on both forks. If I have coins on SegWit address I will loose them on a new chain - miners will take them.
The price and exchange adoption of those new coins are questionable but who knows.
