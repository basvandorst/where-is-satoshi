Bitcoin is in a catch-22.  It will be most useful to huge financial firms, but its marketcap needs to be much higher as 3 billion is nothing to them.  The only way it gets higher at the moment is consumers adopting it, which they have little incentive to do.  Bitcoin needs some sort of b2b cost saving breakthrough to really get us headed to the moon.

It is a discoverable min/max wage for computers only.  With your computers hashing power dedicated to mining a specific digital currency you basically know how much you will make per hour in that currency based on your hashing power (theoretically, not practically).  If you do the work, you can't make less or more than a certain amount per hour in that currency (over enough instances or in a pool where randomness stops substantially mattering).  With btc you'd likely lose money overall with power consumptions, but any device that can mine would earn at least a small small amount at that computational wage.  Each digital currency has its own computational min/max wage and hashing power does not translate between currencies that use different algorythms.
Qualifications: mining is unpredicatable in the short term.  Fees earned on avg must remain fairly level.  Hash power of the network is THE control on the wage.  The rewarding halving crushes the wage when it halves.
Know the currency rates, currency wages, and your computers hashing powrer in that currency - then change your mining field instantly.
Bitcoin rewards individuals, but if each block reward was instead a socialist distribution based on hashing power by all miners who worked on the given block - the wage earned per hash unit would still be the same :o. Socialism however breaks trust because suddenly faking hashing power, doing fake/bad work, gets introduced and is equally rewarded to real work.

If A is lightcoin, miners moving from B to A isn't good because their rigs are now worth much less for mining.  Whichever coin miners must invest more money to mine competetively is the better invest.

The list of accomplishments you begin with are exactly why Vice is state propoganda disguised as journalism.  Nobody can get into ISIS, they can only fake it.  Nobody gets footage of Bagdadi, only Vice.  People implementing a caliphate do not trust known journalists from a western publication on sinning.  When you potentially compromise IS positions and strategy in a warzone, and show your face helping a western vanity project, you die.  Vice is footage of people shooting guns into the air at imaginary targets.  They are smiling and cracking up.  Interviews with children constantly looking over at the off camera person who told them what to say, asking with their eyes if they are doing it right. Fake firefight footage where soldiers pretending to be shot at DO NOT TAKE DEFENSIVE POSITIONS just crouching on their feet and leaving your entire body open as a target.  It is an absurd fantasy presented to people who have seen too many movies and played too many video games.  "The sniper is in that tower.  I hope we will be safe as we pass through.  We made it!"

Long and more pessimistic:
Making workers compete way too hard to the short term benefit of Peters Principle managers with no ability to accurately distinguish who would be best.  100 great workers competing for 1 great job, where 99 settle for a job that someone less qualified could do just as well is a massive economic waste,  Wages get out of sync with economic growth and you get a death spiral.  Banks gamble on fictional assets instead of investing in entrepeneurs.  Leads to longterm catastrophe where generation after generation in Western countries experiences increasing friction when attempting class mobility. Your children won't have the opportunities you did.  Won't own a home or land.  Won't be able to live in the same cities.  Won't get the economic benefit of higher education.  Won't get married when they'd like to.  Won't have children when they'd like to, or as many as they'd want.  They'll work longer and get less when they retire.  They will pay more for less.  We became complacent in rent seekers profitting from perpetual war and mass imprisonment, at the expense of that money allowing our children to have good lives.  Instead they'll exist and connect in a VR corporate Matrix.  The rent seekers growth outpaces real growth until there is no real growth.  Rent seekers maintain control through government iron triangle.  We bail out the rent seekers when their crony capitalism collapses.

My takeaway is 10 minute block times are stoplights and there must be a better way.  Perhaps proof of work should be in direct proportion to reward, so a block found in 1 minute gets 2.5 btc and a block found in 30 minutes gets 75 btc.  Perhaps the blocksize should be tied in as well so a 1 minute block has a 100kb limit but a 30 min block is 3mb.

Every discussion of bitcoin's use talks about its low transaction cost.  If that stops being a priority we need to jump to a more advanced altcoin.  The developers who don't want the blocksize increase are going to centralize transactions around a sidechain they profit from that currently does not work.  The centralization argument is a joke.  This is an argument about capping internet bandwidth in the early 90s.  Create a schedule for raising the limit, get tips from more transactions, and then blocks will still fill up eventually causing prices to rise.  1MB blocks forever is 56k modems forever.

Bitcoin is data and can be encoded in a multitude of ways that would make it undetectable to censors.  For instance a bitcoin address could be encoded as a soundfile, image, or emoticons.  So censors would not be able to recognize bitcoin depending on how it is sent.  Further, many Chinese use services that get around the censorship firewall, so it is already ineffective.

This guy doesn't get it in the least.  As automation takes hold and eliminates jobs, job opportunities will be severely restricted to those who are unquestioning and loyal to the status quo.  The supermajority of citizens will either work for government or a giant corporation at a wage where they can barely raise one child with two incomes.  They'll believe propaganda that their lower standard of living is good for the environment.  We have passed the point of no return where governments listen to banks and not citizens.  The rich won and democracy lost.  Get rich or live in a virtual reality.

Counterparty is amazing.  I didn't get it until I got a pepe asset, then I finally understood how decentralized asset trading could rule the world.  Was similar to the first time using bitcoin.  Can't be explained, have to use.  My guy says stocks on the blockchain will dwarf currency.

Buy wherever and then store the coins how you feel comfortable, then only where you store matters.  Haven't tried circle yet.  1BTC is a good start.  You are investing so plan to hold unless you want to figure out day trading (semi impossible, you just get lucky).

The missing piece of this system so far is the ability to buy and sell loans, especially dump defaults for a few cents.  The major worry of such a system would be people defaulting intentionally to buy back on the cheap, although credit scoring would mitigate somewhat.

People who don't know tech but have heard of bitcoin are still down on it because of the price bubble and all the bad press from around that time with Gox and Silk Road.  It is still held back, but is kind of impressive it survived as well as it did as opposed to dropping below $100.

The bitcoin community is weaker than I've ever seen it in my very short time in the space.  The blocksize debate really killed the enthusiasm of the community.  Artificially capping the transaction market for the asinine goal where transactions will cost 3 cents instead of a penny, stupidly ignoring that the block reward subsidizes each transaction $5 dollars.  The community is plagued by important voices who don't believe in good will towards the community and unhypocritically limit markets while pretending to advocate the free market.  Investors trying to cash in way too early in an infant technology and deriding protocol improvements as "science projects" exposing themselves as the luddites they truly are.

18 months so very new.  FWIW I believe bitcoin is in the process of blowing it's edge over another cryptocurrency becoming the internet standard.  It is still the best bet and has the infrastructure edge, but hash rate growth has been lackluster and Bitpay going down would kill a lot of goodwill towards businesses accepting crypto payments.  Currency is bitcoin's killer app, and if the currency loses momentum it doesn't have the functionality to fall back on that newer crypto's like Ethereum have.
