You expect us to believe that you know how much it costs to charter a 747 (who charters an entire 747?  Thats a ridiculous amount of plane) across the Pacific on the implication that you've done it, but also kept up with the $480 in diesel your RV used this winter?

The system is leterally built on taking young, dumb kids and enticing them into signing themselves into endurtured servitude.   My mom pretty much forced me at 17 to sign a loan for 30k at 12.~% to go to a private school, ended up hating it, and dropping enough classes I wasn't a sophmore at the end of my first year.  Didn't return, obviously.
Now I work a minumum wage job, live at home, and have no prospects of following any of my dreams for a decade, if ever!

That simply isn't true, it may not be the best option for most people that choose it, but to imply that it isn't a valid option for certain people is just incorrect.

BTC had (*had*) a market cap of 2.5B.  You really think there is 25,000,000,000,000,000 dollars were unaware of being moved?  The worlds economy isn't even close to a quadrillion dollars, much less 25.

okay, lets say bitcoins go from 250 to 2.50, still your number comes out to 250 TRILLION dollars...  I don't see the need for your exaggeration

Many, if not most people *serious* about suicide won't tell anyone.

The business of business is truly one of the worst aspects of modern society.
(but I bought in at under a dollar so I'm still laughing!)
