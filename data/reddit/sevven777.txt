i hope you are right, but i doubt it.
humans aren't keen to change when it comes to important things like renewable energy, e-cars, cryptocurrency, geting rid of political corruption or the banking mafia, tougher environmental protection, abolishment of nuclear energy/weapons, etc.
smart phones are a toy, it's easy to try a new app out. that's not comparable to personal banking and financing your life.

i think you misunderstand his statement.
you're probably talking about the technical side of bitcoin. he is talking about the practical side of it.
on the day where bigger market makers create higher liquidity on cryptocurrency exchanges and the volatility decreases bitcoins will be worth more.
on the day where i can buy my groceries and pay my rent with bitcoins it will be worth even more.
on the day where investors have that much trust in the currency that they buy it as an investment, it will be even more.
but all that demand isn't there yet. it's mostly tech enthusiasts and criminals that use it now.
i mean 250.000 transactions per day? that's probably what a single shopping mall handles on an average day.

people have been saying shit like this for 100 years. and after every financial crash it is business as usual. the economy rises like phoenix out of the ashes of the last crisis and the public forgets what all the fuss was about.
what makes you think that people will have more trust in the new system than the central banks?

no, that was just the first bank to fall victim in the US. it started years earlier with predatory lending and really kicked off a year before lehmans bankruptcy with the rise in adjustable mortgage rates.

yes, a stupid phone game has the same real-world implications and entry barriers as changing the way we do business and manage money.

the public might not have forgotten the great depression, but they did forget the 17 crashes since then.
you are preaching to the choir but bitcoin is years, probably decades away from being a true alternative.
it's toy money for 99% of the population. and the only thing that gives any currency value, is trust.

well, the real douche bank is goldman sachs.
but don't worry. we have found a solution here in europe. we simply shrink the banks to 1% of their pre crash market cap.
too big to fail? pah
