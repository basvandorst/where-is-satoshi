To be fair, the price fluctuates so much that the post could have said anywhere between 13,000 and 9,000 and still be correct.

Yeah, but the alternative was basically killing myself. I just couldn't live with the dysphoria; I couldn't study, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't live. I know this is an awful idea, but it's been done, and it was honestly a risk that I wanted to take, despite how bad the consequences were.

I would have regretted not taking medication more. The bone growth and voice changes caused by puberty are permanent, and wasn't something I was willing to live with.

What is the best way to trade using leverage?

Because the alternative was basically killing myself. You don't know what it's like to live with dysphoria. I couldn't sleep or study or do anything with my life, and I was cutting myself and depressed all of the time. I had a counselor and everything. Didn't help. After going on meds, I've been able to do so much more.

Bitcoin is the only way I can buy meds in secret, and earn money without my parents noticing. It was kind of the whole point of the post.

I mean, holistically, it probably isn't. But I did consult with people who specialize in helping people like me online, and I've been on meds for 11 months with no unintended side effects. 
Also, I refuse to accept the alternative.

I saw a counselor for my depression. He encouraged it and helped me with it. You dont know what dysphoria is like.
