The 2013 crash was much worse. And a lot of "investors" were slaughtered. But no. I do not recall anything that has resembled this since then. There were definitely dips and corrections. But I don't think the entire crypto market has ever fallen 40%+ over two days.
Some of us are lucky enough, as it stands right now, to be able to hold without worry. Others of us are not so lucky.
And as much as I hope it doesn't happen, there is a possibility this doesn't recover. Holding an asset that doesn't gain value over a long period of time sucks. Trust me. I bought BBRY stock in 2011 and I still own it today.

"I'm bearish on bitcoin" isn't equivalent to "I think I should sell my entire holdings".
I'm bearish on bitcoin, but I'm not selling my holdings. Why you may ask? Because I've been wrong before.

Buy a bunch of bitcoin on credit, preferably equal to about 10x your monthly income.
Every time bitcoin drops x%, where that percentage is equal  your monthly income divided by your total bitcoin holdings, take 5 shots.
If you ever make it to -50%, hope that you die from alcohol poisoning.

The price of bitcoin fell 20% over a month before Mt. Gox suspended trading. What do you think happens if one of Binance, GDAX, Kraken, Bitstamp, etc. becomes insolvent?
If any of these rely on the value of crypto going up in order to stay afloat, any sort of extended bear market will cause them to collapse.
So yeah. Be fucking careful, stupid.

Is it not concerning to you that Kraken and Gemini do the same thing with way less customers?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:27:08
Well most of the issues have been withdrawing in USD, which only a few exchanges support. Of the exchanges that do support that, they've all had problems.
But feel free to try and prove that the complaints against coinbase are worse than Kraken or Gemini. Like I've said. I've used most of the exchanges. I can only use the foreign ones for buying and selling shitcoins, as none of them support ACH and I'm not paying wire fees if I don't have to.
I can tell you haven't actually followed what's going on with other exchanges, because 


is obvious bullshit to anyone who actually uses this shit.

It's actually relative. If i'm a 60 year old man, I'm probably better of leaving my money in the bank. If I'm a 20 year old kid, super risky investments are probably only worth taking if I have solid earning potential, otherwise, I should probably be using the money to increase my earnings potential.
If your investment portfolio isn't diversified between many very different asset classes, you're probably doing it wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:47:26
I'm not sure if I'm reading this correctly. They're investing in bitcoin miners?
Seems like a really bad idea. The ROI on bitcoin mining requires extremely cheap electricity. On top of that, it requires a large upfront investment. If the price of bitcoin doesn't increase, it's probably going to take years for them to see a return. They may never recoup their costs.

You've basically given in to FOMO.
If you put $500 in bitcoin in 2014, you probably would have done what the rest of us did when we invested in bitcoin in 2014. Sold a large chunk of it in 2017, when our investment finally paid off.

If the fee's and price of bitcoin both dropped by a factor of 10, fees would still be between $2 and $3 and the price would be $1400.
Bitcoin fees should be under a dime per transaction. If i'm going to be spending $2 to $3 per transaction, I might as well use paypal.

Another misconception. Things don't need to feel like they did before in order to have the same outcome as they did before.
Again, you're not going to find any solid evidence that will suggest what the market is going to do. If that existed, people wouldn't share it on reddit for free. If you're expecting that sort of thing in this thread, I can tell you right now, you're not going to find it.
The only thing you can do is weigh all your options and all the possibilities, and decide what to do based off of that.
So if you have 20,000 invested in bitcoin, and you're not prepared to lose it. Well, you should probably reduce that to a amount that you are prepared to lose.
If you have 10,000 to invest into bitcoin, and you're trying to determine if it's worth investing in. Again, just ask yourself if you're prepared to lose that amount, and if that is the case, then go for it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:42:54

I think we're past that.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:53:51
I think you're missing the point, which is that you have a perception of why bitcoin will not enter a bear market. If your perception is wrong, your entire perceived outcome *could* be wrong.
So what this all really boils down to is what I've said the entire time. We don't know for sure. We can't predict the future, we can only attempt to. Predicting the market isn't a science. It's a activity in hindsight.
But again, "valuable" isn't a binary term. The question you may want to ask yourself is "are these properties what contributes to the current value of bitcoin". That's actually easy to answer. No. There is way more to it than that. This is easily proved because you can't just clone bitcoin and expect the new tokens to be as valuable.
So what makes bitcoin different? Well, being first helps. Branding definitely helps. People have heard of bitcoin. They haven't heard of shitcoin(an exact copy of bitcoin).
Another misconception you have is that smart people working on something drives its value. Go visit a few college campuses and meet some of the professors/researchers. You'll find some very poor, very smart people. In other words, you can't directly derive the relationship of the value of something to the IQ of the people working on it. Also, there are some really wealthy billionaires out there that were able to capitalize on some really dumb ideas. Also, there are some really smart people working on some of these shit coins. But you may never even hear of them.
May I ask why you are asking in the first place?

Except when you look at more recent figures, bitcoin has suffered worse dips than LTC and ETH.
LTC serves a purpose. ETH serves a purpose. Both of these coins do everything bitcoin does except better.
Bitcoin could be the next gold. And gold hasn't grown worth a shit the last 5 years.
I still hold bitcoin because I have no reason to sell, but I strongly believe that it will be outclassed and I place the blame on the core devs. They have painted this utopia for bitcoin and they've completely disregarded the people actually wanting to use it. That is not good for adoption.

Their is a direct relationship between network hashing power and difficulty. Meanwhile, the block reward remains quasi-static. 
Therefore, the average cost for producing bitcoin increases as network hashing power increases. If we assume that no one wants to sell their bitcoins at a loss, the price of bitcoin must rise.

So I'm a software engineer, and good software engineers do not "flock to the best". Some good software engineers flock to the money, some flock to what is new and exciting, and some stick with what they know.
There are at last two types of FUD. FUD purposely spread, which I will call illegitimate FUD, and FUD sourced from actual concern. 
I have everything to lose if bitcoin tanks. But based off my knowledge and expertise, bitcoin has a problem and the lightening network isn't the magic bullet.
Bitcoin grew a lot in 2017, but it grew the slowest out of the vast majority of the top 10 cryptocurrencies.
So Bitcoin has a hard-headed dev team who have been promising that "LN will solve our problems"... and this is the opposite of FUD. This is hope, and it has two forms as well, both good and bad. And if LN doesn't solve the problems, we're going to see a very polarized community. And this polarity will pave the way for alt coins which are currently focused on solving specific problems.
So the only thing really to take away from this is: Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

is not the same as


So your facts are a bit ... fake.
What companies/exchanges do you suggest have better service than coinbase?
Edit: 
Also if you read the article that sources this article, you'll see that exactly what I said is happening. The complaints are based off of withdrawing funds, which involves two parties, coinbase, and the bank.
Are you an american? Have you used multiple exchanges? Don't take my word for it. Try it yourself.
And yes, you obviously do have an agenda. Especially with a title like "For the love of god. Stop using Coinbase."
More information from the source article (not coindesk, which FYI is affiliated with coinbase)


So in other words, this is cherry picked data based on the CFPB complaint database and probably contains biases in the data itself that would make it pretty skewed when comparing to non-us based exchanges. Additionally, your comparison lacks merit because raw-number of complaints is pretty useless alone. You'd need more context, such as how many customers these exchanges are servicing.
But regardless of all of that, I've personally used damn near all the popular exchanges, both foreign and domestic. As bad as you think coinbase is, you won't understand truly how inefficient all these exchanges are... Mostly because they're small companies servicing a lot of customers.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:09:04
How about simply the fact that speculation drives the price of bitcoin. People are expecting to see massive annualized returns on their investment. Soon as that stops being the status quo, you could see a slow, steady drop, aka, a bear market.
The dotcom bubble is an example of this. People were pouring VC money into dotcom companies, trying to get a slice of the returns you were seeing from said tech companies.
The market crashed after the dotcom bubble without any major catalysts. It just became apparent that the value of these tech companies was over-inflated.

As someone who bought into bitcoin for the first time in early 2015, I've experienced 6-month bitcoin volatility with a flat trend-line. You'd be up 30% one week, and down 30% the next. After 6 months, your ROI had hardly budged.
Then all of a sudden, it doubles. Then you have another 6 months of flat, volatility. Then all of a sudden, it doubles again.
However, I'm not dumb enough to assume just because being patient paid handsomely in the past that it will pay off again. 
I have the same sentiment now that I had in 2015. Bitcoin could go to zero tomorrow. It's a small portion of my overall investment portfolio. 
Sure, I could have went 100% bitcoin in 2017, and would have been able to retire. But hindsight is 20/20. Could had just as easily gambled away my life-savings.

is moderated, so only good things about Kraken there. Try for a lot of kraken hate. Then head over to for some gemini hate.
Kraken scares the shit out of me. The site was so frustrating to use prior to the upgrade. You'd have like 10 second waits between each screen, which was probably 70% likely to timeout and make you start all over. Then they perform an unannounced upgrade that took the entire site offline for over 2 days. Then withdrawals for disabled for another 2 days.
Since the upgrade, it's actually performed pretty well, but they don't have near the volume that coinbase has. Neither does Gemini. Gemini can't even service all the r/bitcoin circle-jerkers trying to create a mass-exodus from coinbase(I should know, I was one of them).
I think most of us would welcome an additional, US-based exchange. Competition in the market is good for the consumer.
Sadly, there is nothing that even comes close to competing at this stage of the game.

Speculation is present in *a lot*(technically wrong to say all) of markets. This is absolutely true. But how much of bitcoins current value is based on speculation.(This is extremely difficult to answer).
But let's do exactly what you suggest, which is to approach the problem from a different direction.
You're saying that bitcoin has value because of certain attributes that make it valuable( decentralized, immutable, secure public block chain). So what could cause a multi-year, bear market? Being wrong.
It's entirely possible that what you *think* gives bitcoin value isn't actually what gives bitcoin value at all. And in the event that is the case, it's very likely that we could see a multi-year bear market.
Like I said, I can't predict the future, and I certainly can't convince you if you refuse to be convinced otherwise.
I'm long on bitcoin and a few other cryptos. I have zero plans to change that position. But I don't pretend that the future is bright simply because I want it to be.

No because that's not how bitcoin works. If you cut the network hashpower in half, you'd only see less bitcoins being mined until the difficulty adjusted.
The algorithm exists in a way that a block is solved every 10 minutes. At that point, the same amount of bitcoins are released from the coinbase(not to be confused with the trading platform).

Bitcoin is still a relatively young security. We don’t really have any historical data to see how it will fair during a global economic downturn.

1. My entire point was we've never seen this rapid of decline. I'm talking about a vector, you're talking about a scalar.
2. That doesn't "put it in perspective" that just changes the perspective. If the average cost basis back in November was $5000, and today the average cost basis is $14000, and you assume  a uniform distribution, that means that 84% of bitcoin holders are in the red. Note: I've made these statistics up, as I obviously don't know the actual average cost-basis, but "Zoom out" is a very narrow view into what these massive dips mean to the average investor.

You can blame them or call them incompetent or whatever. It's true that they could have done things better, they could have been more prepared.
But if you over-prepare, you've wasted money, so it's a tricky game. No one could have predicted how big this stuff would have blown up.

@_date: 2017-12-18 17:54:11
When you start talking about technology, eventually you start talking about the uses of bitcoin. When the cost of transacting bitcoin is as high as it is, it prohibits the use of bitcoin. When you mention that segwit, as it stands now, isn't good enough to meet the demand, people get angry and think you're spreading FUD.

Lightening network only reduces network load if multiple transactions are done between a single address pair. 
This means that either some 3rd party payment solution will develop to utilize this behavior, or places are going to have to keep payment channels open for long periods of time to incorporate multiple transactions.
LN doesn't really solve anything for the "use bitcoin for purchases" scenario on its own. It would need another 3rd party to make use of it effectively.

It's such basic knowledge, but I can't be bothered to source it right now. Excuse me, I'm going to go cruise around on my pet dinosaur.


Ok, now this sounds like a copy-pasta


Uh. Nope. The fork happened at block 478558. Any address with unspent bitcoin prior to that now existed on both chains and could be spent separately on both chains. There was no "little while", as you suggest. People suggested you move your BTC to a new wallet in order to ensure you didn't leak your BTC PK when spending BCH. It may come as a surprised to you that you are actually the one talking out your ass in this instance and you should consider educating yourself on the matter before looking like a fool.
But I don't expect you to suddenly come to the realization that you're simply arguing for the sake of arguing, perhaps even under the delusion that you don't even realize you're bullshitting and not just attempting to determine if we're both naive.
Next time you want to bullshit, make sure the other person doesn't know what they are talking about.

Why is it a given that adding BCH to coinbase would cause the price to go up? We all knew it was going to be added for a couple of days when they accidentally leaked it on their API. Look at my post history. Literally earlier today and yesterday I was talking about how BCH would be added to coinbase, and all the hate-filled sheep on this sub-reddit insisted that soon as that happens, the price of BCH would plummet.

As an engineer, I can tell you that whenever something is going to take some time and effort to implement, we usually band-aid it first with a temporary solution in order to buy time.
The reasoning behind not bandaiding with a block-size increase was because segwit was nearly ready. Unfortunately, segwit didn't solve the problem. This experience has proven that opt-in adoption is far from reliable.
Bitcoin is currently in an nearly unusable state and the members of the community are sitting in the dark waiting for someone to provide some direction.
The 1MB block sizes are completely arbitrary. The solution is simple. The risk is minimal. I don't understand what the hold up is.
The TLDR of your post is basically "hold on and have faith." Do you see the issue here?

LTC uses scrypt. ETH is based around smart contracts. Bitcoin was the first big player in the market and has a well established network. Bitcoin Cash can utilize the Bitcoin network and offers the ability to transact bitcoin at low fees.
There are other alts that offer these same things, but these 4 have the most support. So I own all 4.

The blockchain is different. The miners can be pointed at either node, however. It's pretty common for miners to flip/flop back and fourth to point at whichever coin is more profitable. As time has gone on, we've gotten closer to parity.

K, well I have. I'm a computer engineer. I was mining bitcoin and running runescape bot farms in college for fun. I also enjoy online poker, and bitcoin was the best way to play online poker in those days.
I don't disagree that the $30 fee was over-exagerated. But it wasn't far off, and considering we're literally talking about sending money to yourself, and we'd all consider a $5 ATM fee outrageous, I think you're attacking my post without considering the context.
Listen, if you have zero issue with TX fees, that's fine. You're entitled to your opinion. But the reason I believed in bitcoin early is because you used to be able to send money to anyone way cheaper than you could through any other means, and I thought that had massive potential. There is a ton of interesting stuff you could do with the block chain, but when the average (which yes, we should be using average) cost for sending a transaction is more than it cost to wire money using a bank(which we all think is ridiculous, btw), then all that shit goes away.
So again. Call my posts FUD because you think I'm part of "the other team"... but if you've been around bitcoin long enough, you'd understand that Us-vs-them within the cryptocoin realm is foolish.
My guess is you don't give a shit about the technology or cryptocurrency in general. You just want to see the value of bitcoin go up because you stand to gain something from that.
But once you realize that I also have something to gain from that, and probably more-so than you, you have to wonder: What sense does your argument make?
**TLDR:** You suggested he could flip a coin using bitcoin. I pointed out that is an expensive way to flip a coin. You made a bunch of assumptions after that.
So who is the asshole here?

This isn't an investment. It's a windfall. We can probably safely assume this 20K is his entire net worth.
The best thing he could do at this point would be to cash out 90% of it and diversify it among various investment vehicles.
But in the end, it's only 20K. If OP is poor, he will always be poor unless he is able to improve his income, which is probably only possible through investing in himself, which in today's world takes way more than 20K.
So TLDR: You're a shitty financial advisor. But don't feel bad; they all are.

It's my opinion that this is a matter of "not if but when". Eventually the entire network will need to adopt segwit or else move down a different path.
I honestly feel like segwit is the worst implementation of scaling that could have been implemented. I think the fear of hard forking is undeniably wrong. Eventually, I predict it will happen anyway, and all this added complexity will be for not.

But using inflation rate vs interest rate is pretty foolish for every day people. You're making a 30 year decision based off the current state of the market, or current rate of inflation. That's all subject to change.
"It's not a 30 year decision, I can sell my house and pay off my debt"... Not if your house suddenly drops in value.
Seriously, this line of thinking is literally the same line of thinking people had prior to the housing crisis.

I never said debt is bad. But most people with debt don't have the income to sustain it. That's why they are in debt. 
It's true. I shouldn't make blanket statements. And the advice definitely isn't for everyone. But there are people who think they can manage their debt, then they lose their job, and they file bankruptcy, but not all their debt clears. And now they're living a miserable life of crippling depression and will likely never overcome it.
And that is sad. So I'd rather heir on the side of "Focus on getting rid of your debt", because there is a truly freeing feeling once it's gone. Your paychecks come in and it's all yours. You no longer care about money. And at that point, when you start investing, you're less emotional.

I have no reason to support BCH, but knowing what I know, the two technologies(BCH and BTC) do not differ in ways that you could make this argument. In fact, one could argue the exact opposite. The only way to make moving bitcoin cheap is to rely on a company to do it for you (like coinbase).

Pros: 
If you don't have the funds available in your coinbase account, you can get that at that price at that point in time. Coinbase basically trusts that the funds are there and honors your purchase.
You pay a pretty hefty fee. I'm not sure the exact calculation, but it's between 1.5 and 2% from what I can tell. However, this is the same as if you use a debit/credit card because there is a processing fee for those as well.
The best course of action is to ACH money into your account ahead of time and wait for the transaction to clear. Then transfer that money to GDAX, at which point you can be a market maker and pay 0% fees. You can then move money around without fees.

That's kind of what forks do. They took the open source code, forked it, and added cash to the end of it. Everything else you've stated is pure propaganda.
And you're correct. I do own bcash. Only because I've owned bitcoin since 2012. I used to mine bitcoin out of my dorm room in college using GPUs, then I mined them in my apartment(as well as various other shitcoins). I bought my first KNC ASIC around 2013/2014 and basically reinvested all my bitcoin earnings into those.
I think propaganda has created an us-vs-them mentality around here, and people are foolish to pick one or the other. Both will continue to coexist. Bitcoin cash, as it stands today, provides more value as a currency than bitcoin does. Bitcoin has first-mover advantage.
And honestly, I really don't care. I got into bitcoin a long time ago because I thought it was interesting, and stuck around for a while because I thought it had potential, and today, I continue to be curious because that is just my nature.
But it's no longer interesting. The only thing people care about anymore is the price, and that is all driven by speculation. Now I'm just enjoying my gains and wasting time on a friday night on reddit.

All internet was probably routed through what is essentially a proxy server owned by the government so they could monitor and restrict his usage. All blackberries, at that time, had that capability, however.

I call it bcash and bitcoin core in a lot of posts on this subreddit just to differentiate between the two. But I also say BTC vs BCH, which is more socially acceptable among both groups.
Funny thing is, people consider me a bitcoin cash proponent, and I purposely call it bcash because it confuses the fuck out of people. They'll be like "Wait, your post makes it sound like you like bcash, but then you called it bcash, so I don't know what to think"...
But in reality, I'm not a proponent of either crypto. I own both. I diversify my holdings because, unlike in the past, I think it's highly probable that altcoins will see their value grow disproportionately to bitcoin in the future, and rather than have a 25% chance of guessing correctly, I'll just diversify and hopefully not been wrong on all accounts.
But yeah, I catch a lot of shit on this subreddit for not falling in line with the "bitcoin cash is a scam coin" rhetoric. And honestly, I don't care.
Most people who "pick a side" just enjoy being on a side and enjoy the tension that is created with "the other side". 
EDIT: This is off-topic, but I should also say I don't believe fiat is going away. People talk about the the dollar going to zero, but these people obviously don't understand how powerful the US government is. And unless we live in the world where the US government doesn't have power, the USD will always have value as long as it's back by it.

If you spent your bitcoin on the bitcoin chain after the fork, you still had BCH on the BCH chain. The only way you'd be unable to not claim the BCH would be if you lost the PK and/or it was stolen.
Why do you think coinbase was able to credit everyone with BCH who owned BTC at the time of the fork? Because they had control of the wallets, thus they possessed the BCH.
And I googled "How much bitcoin cash is claimed" and various derivatives of that and wasn't able to come up with anything that backs your claims.
If you want to get into a dick measuring contest, I've been invested in bitcoin since 2014, I'm fairly positive I own way more BTC than you do, I have nearly 10 years experience as a professional software engineer, and none of this matters other than the fact that for some reason you seem to care...

How are they determining the "number of shares" that exist for bitcoin? Because, as with all currencies, when you try and understand how much is in circulation, the best thing you can do is guess.

It's a very imperfect metric, but most metrics are. 
With that said, the fact that a year ago, most "first-timer" exchanges were only offering bitcoin, and now the majority of them at least offer BTC, LTC, and ETH is daunting.
Bitcoin has become nearly unusable. I honestly think that people were lying to themselves when they felt that bitcoin would still continue to grow (relative to everything else) as merely a store of value.
But that is what happens when any "Fear, Uncertainty, or doubt" that any current bitcoin users express is met with criticism and accusation of shilling.
I've been in bitcoin since 2014. It was very hard for me to go against my initial instincts to pursue interest in various alt-coins. Historically, even coins like LTC, which today has become pretty reputable, were considered inferior to bitcoin.

Bcash was valued about roughly 10% of what BTC was when the fork happened. That's far from unsubstantial. I think you're making shit up about the BTC volumes and BCH claims, so maybe you could source that? I have a hard time believing people wouldn't claim free money. Also it would certainly be difficult to differentiate between whether people have left their BCH unclaimed or decided to hold both.

I've found the majority of the community here has no problem talking about bitcoin cash.
Also your comparison is apples to oranges. More like to you go to to talk about ubuntu, but even that's not a very good comparison. Bitcoin was the first crypto, and because of that, people will tend to associate anything crypto related to it.
I don't really have affirmation towards any coins specifically. I've found, however, that those in control of this subreddit, have declared allegiance to bitcoin instead of facilitating discussion around anything conceivably related.
This predates the existence of these alt-coins. For reasons unknown to me, it seems that those in charge of this sub have decided that this subreddit needs to exist to promote bitcoin. They view altcoins as a threat to their existence, and thus heavily moderate the content here to only allow the discussion of alt-coins in a way that promotes bitcoin. This is why you see anti-bcash submissions everyday atop this sub.
This has created an "us-vs-them" mentality, and such a lot of older members of this community have been effectively exiled for questioning the rhetoric.
This actually greatly reduces the quality of this sub-reddit. R/bitcoin, which used to be a reliable source of information for bitcoin, is instead just a hive-mind. Every topic that exists is either a news, meme, or promotion of bitcoin.
It's sad, really.

Step one is spending all your BTCs into a new wallet that you can control on a BTC core node.
Step two is spending your pre-fork wallet on a BCH node. 
As long as you do it in this order, the BCH node cannot steal your coins(at least on the core node that they don't control).
Make sure you wait for the transactions to confirm before moving to step 2.
Let's say you didn't do step 1. The BCH node would possess the ability to hijack your keys and send your BTC core node coins to their own wallet.

I think you're missing the point. The label is meaningless. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. It always has been. The fact that you wouldn't call this a crash just means that you don't want to call it a crash. The fact that someone else would call this a crash just means they want to call it a crash.
But people love to gamble on this shit. Some come out major winners, others come out major losers.
Point is, if BTC can double in a month, it can halve in a month as well. Any sort of event that would cause people to lose their confidence in bitcoin would be devastating for it.
Look at online poker. April 2011, US Department of Justice decides to shut down various US based online poker websites. These caused a massive "sell-off" because people wanted their money.
What if US DoJ decided to shutdown coinbase? What do you think would happen to the price of BTC?
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:28:07
Exchanges, specifically American based exchanges.
A good percentage of BTC right now is held by exchanges. All it takes to crash the price of BTC is some sort of DOJ raid on coinbase for whatever reason they deem(not saying this is going to happen, or that there is reason for this to happen, just giving an example of something that could happen). 
All of a sudden, confidence in the currency drops, people sell-off their holdings in panic, and the price crashes.
Or perhaps Coinbase gets slapped with some legal trouble and they get shutdown. Perhaps before all this happens, the owners move their entire holdings into a private wallet.
People love BTC because it's anonymous and so easy to move money. People will hate BTC for that same reason if their precious coins are stolen and they have zero way to recover the value.
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:16:15


That's a meaningless statement. You have to define what you mean by performance, and then you can probably make some factual remarks, but you're honestly just making some sort of generalization.
And I realize there is life outside the US, but the US is responsible for 25% of the Worlds GDP, 26% of the world's consumer spending. 25% of the worlds wealth is controlled by US entities. Outside of of my "shallow american worldview" or whatever snarky comment you're trying to make, I think it's fair to conclude that removing american interest from the equation is going to be pretty detrimental.
Additionally, I'm not certain what you're referring to when you talk about the benefits of "blockchain technology". The technology that BTC is built upon is not something specific to it, or even cryptocurrency in general. If you're referring specifically to a decentralized currency, as it stands today, that's not much of a consequence. After-all, there are plenty of decentralized currencies that exist outside of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies. Perhaps you can elaborate on what you mean specifically.
So back to the original point, which was to refute your statement:


That's an extremely narrow viewpoint and a very naive statement. For one, it alludes that you are some oracle of bitcoin and understand exactly what is and isn't capable of stopping bitcoin.
I realize you are probably a bitcoin supporter, and there is nothing wrong with that. I also support bitcoin. Doesn't mean I'm going to ignore all possibilities that could essentially end its adoption.

Create a 2nd wallet, send all the coins from your first wallet to your 2nd wallet. This will spend those coins if it gets confirmed before your first transaction. Your first transaction will then get denied because you can't double spend the coins.
To increase the odds of this happening, you'll have to create a higher than average fee so that the transaction gets prioritized. Good luck.

But why is that relevant? The market cap of my company isn't even a pixel on your screen on that chart. Why does that mean it has potential to be worth 25x it's value in any sort of near term projection? It doesn't.
Which is what I'm asking, because I see it a lot. "Bitcoin is going to the moon". Why do people think that? I'm not denying it, I'm literally asking for a reason why. Enlighten me.
I'm not trying to claim I know the direction of BTC. I think what a lot of people do is look at their holdings of BTC, and determine that an X increase is what meets their financial goals, and then they just assert that is the actual value of the coin. 
There is a real cost for producing BTC. That is partially what drives the price. There are a lot of uses for BTC. Some legal, some not so much. That is partially what drives the price. Another factor is pure speculation, and it's kind of a derivative of the first two. People speculate that the cost and the demand are both going to increase over time, therefor people purchase BTC for it's ability to retain value. And there are a plethora of things I'm unaware of that drive the price.
But if people lose confidence in BTC. If something would happen where people became scared to trade their USD for BTC, this could potentially kill the valuation.
Point is, statistically, for every 2500% claim for BTC, there is a 4% claim that is equally valid. Last time BTC grew like this, it lost 80% of it's peak value over the next 2 years.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:02:45


Actually, you saw a fairly stable price around the $100 price point, before a gradual rise to $200, a slight dip, then over the next 30 days you saw the price mostly climb with huge volatility.
Yes, 600% over 30 days is still not the same as 90% over 30 days, but their are a ton of other factors beside Mt. Gox and Silk Road that affected the price. You had the rise of an industry with the advent of ASICs. People were investing more into bitcoin infrastructure, which has a cost and thus is going to support a bottom line for BTC.
I may just be naive, but I think this most recent trend is purely price manipulation. The issues with BTC still exist today. Perhaps this is speculation around the australian tax changes. Perhaps China has decided to go long on BTC. who fucking knows.

The DOJ could stop all US based exchanges, and that would completely change bitcoin. If it became extremely difficult to convert BTC to USD, the amount of interest in bitcoin would drop dramatically.
Not saying that is going to happen, but it is definitely a possibility. This wouldn't "get rid" of bitcoin, but it would get rid of it the same way online poker "went away" in the early part of this decade. 


This is an extremely subjective statement.

You've never pulled money out of your savings account? Or better yet, you never plan to pull money out of your savings account? The guy specifically asked "At what point do you plan to sell it?" and he said "Bitcoin is money, there is no reason to sell it"...
Let's assume he wasn't arguing the semantics of sell versus spend, that would mean you could only ever accumulate bitcoin and never sell/spend it. Eventually, you plan on spending money out of your savings account, that is why you are saving.

What would need to happen for BTC to reach 50k/coin? Bitcoin reaching 2K/BTC would be a 11% jump from today. 50K would be a 2500% increase in value from that point. For reference, the S&amp;P 500 has increased about ~2300% in value over the last 40 years.

Here is what you do. You're going to thank me for this advice later.
People don't realize that the BTC market is actually super predictable and I can tell you how.
You're going to need a local Walmart or some sort of dollar store. These stores often hold these devices called "Magic 8 Balls".
If you ask the 8-ball yes or no questions, it can predict the future. So just ask the 8-ball if BTC will drop to 1300. If it says no, go up. If it says yes, go down. You should be able to pinpoint the bottom of BTC using this method.
You can use this technique again to determine when to sell.
I usually don't give this information out for free, but i'm feeling generous.
Enjoy your wealth.

I've never not exchanged money for goods and services. If bitcoin was money, you wouldn't be holding it, you'd be exchanging it.
"Well it's money that appreciates over time" - yep, that's called an investment. He's absolutely right. If you never exchange it for anything, you'll never experience its value. Are you waiting for your kin to inherit it so they can sell it? Not that there is anything wrong with that, but as humans, eventually we die.
Maybe a lot of people "don't get this" because it actually doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Just a thought.

Use and value are connected, but that doesn't stop them from being fundamentally different. It's like a Venn diagram. Things can be only useful, only valuable, useful and valuable, neither useful nor valuable. 
Better yet, you can plot things on a chart of useful vs valuable. If valuable was on the Y-axis, and useful on the X, you'd see things like Diamonds and The Kardashians at the top left, Piles of dogshit near the origin, etc.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It's another meaningless metric created by day-traders who claim to think their "indicators" are valid because occasionally or eventually they indicate the event they're supposed to. But mostly it's just an indicator for momentum that can often be wrong.
With that said, you shouldn't just blindly HODL either. It's ok to take a profit.

Man, I don't want to be pedantic here, being a joke and all, but you started it.
Force caused by air-resistance would be the only upward force on him if he was in free-fall, which is what I assume you mean by "how fast he is going". And yes, you are correct, depending on the air-density and his surface area, could cause him to be pushed back into his seat. The force from the seat would push back.
G-force, isn't actually a force, but an acceleration. So if there are rockets on the back of this cart, then yes, the cart would be accelerating at a rate greater than the acceleration due to earths gravity.
But this could be on mars, for all we know. And more importantly, it was a stupid joke. Fuck you for doing this to me.

Also it should be stated that this amount represents your **gains**, aka your profit. When you purchase BTC, what you paid for it is the cost basis. When you sell it, your gains are your sale price - the cost basis.

Let's say I commit a crime in which I steal copious amounts of money. I need to "clean" that money, so I go to this machine, convert it to bitcoin.
I get caught. Go to jail. The police never recover the money because there is no way to know about my bitcoin wallet. I have no other assets, so the victims get no retribution. They're just SoL.
Meanwhile, I get out of jail, and I siphon money from my bitcoin wallet and continue living my life.
There are downsides to currencies have no accountability.

I have a background in software engineering and economics. I disagree with your assumption. Not saying that it couldn't drive the price up, because it could, but there is no reason to believe that it will.
Aside from that, bitcoin has other limiting factors that make fiat currency and traditional forms of exchange more desirable, specifically security. Removing a single source of authority becomes scary in a world full of fraud and extortion.

A lot of people tote the greatness of bitcoin due to decentralization and lack of central governing authority.
Just as you should be able to make assumptions of vendor honesty, you can make those same assumptions about governing authorities for traditional currencies.
Furthermore, if a person's support for bitcoin stems from the above selling points, you can't introduce escrow, as that is a governing authority.
Which is what makes bitcoin extremely interesting. It's a lot like gold. It has a cost to obtain it. It has some beneficial uses. But as a currency, it's pretty lackluster. However it still holds value. With that said, it's also very, very different from gold.

So you're saying BTC is easier to use now than the internet was in the 90s? I disagree. 
Sure, not everyone had "the internet" back in the mid 90s, but it was pretty simple to use. I don't want to turn this into a pissing match, but I wasn't even a teenager, and knew how to open up netscape navigator, enter a search term into the search bar, find my favorite websites, and bookmark those badboys.
Meanwhile, even today, if I want purchase some bitcoin, it's stupidly more complicated than it should be. If I want to purchase something with that bicoin, it's stupidly more complicated than it should be(Not the purchasing part, but finding a vendor that actually accepts it)...
Fast forward to 2005, most people had the internet in some form or another. Those that didn't have it were capable of using it. My grandma knew how to play card games over the internet. Sure, her browser was half covered in malware, but she knew how to use it for what she wanted to use it for.
It's 2017, and most of us have no idea what we should use bitcoin for. We may use it for something, but we don't truly know if that is how we should be using it.

I'm not sure why you feel that making the ability to exchange bitcoin (for anything) is bad for it. 
If people don't feel secure in their transaction of currency for goods/services, people aren't going to use that currency.
Also I'd argue that bitcoin isn't "trustless" but in fact the opposite. If I send someone bitcoin in exchange for services without going through a middleman or central authority, I'm only going to do it if I 100% trust the person.
