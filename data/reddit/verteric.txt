If you have dogecoin address I'll send some.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:48:46
Great.  I can look like a douchebag when I make a payment.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:43:14
Who is Steve Case?  Really.  I never heard of him.  Yes, there's google.
@_date: 2014-04-25 04:10:32
SELL!  I'm getting paid tomorrow. Need cheap coins.
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:04:04
I don't think you understand the whole "decentralized currency" thing.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:19:52
By normal, you mean going back to $1163?
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:48:49
This.  Solves such a big problem.
@_date: 2014-04-23 10:21:20
How many bitcoins does he own?

Bring out the Gimp.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:55:05
Nice.  Looking forward to hear about the Neo &amp; Bee scandal.
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:43:19
Great.  Now I can look like a doucebag when I make a payment.

What's the price target?  I don't have a speaker to listen to the video at the moment.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:53:06
The time is now.  It will only get harder to switch.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:45:51
SD cards are as reliable as my stoner brother.
I'll stick to paper wallet thank you.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:13:30
I love satoshi as well.  Everything will be integers.
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:13:57
Nice.  I was waiting for some China-Bans-Bitcoin-News so I can purchase some coins at a lower price.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:39:28
Just move everything to Satoshi.  No more decimal places.  Everything is an integer.
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:20:09
Bitcoin will always be king due to network effect, first to market and mass adoption.
For micropayments, Dogecoin may take the title of Litecon's self proclaimed "Silver to Bitcoin's Gold".
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:14:30
There are, but get ready to be even more confuse.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:07:39
Not sure if this comment is sarcastic.  
Let the free market decide.
Walk up to a fiat currency exchange.  Ask them do you sell bitcoin?  Enough people do it and the company will start selling bitcoin.  It's the same thing as exchanging a foreign currency.

@_date: 2014-04-24 10:04:13
How much dollars do you have in your bank account?
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:10:00
Does he even need to when it's like 10 people mining.
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:38:50
Yup. He saw it coming a mile away.  The guy knows everything.
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:56:33
Probably no revenue.  It's about getting page views and a large user base.  Then sell it.  That's the model for Whatsapp.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:15:14
Are we talking about the same thing?  When I say currency exchange I mean these guys:
They buy from coinbase 1 btc = $500.  Sell it to a customer for $550 dollar.
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:41:56
You must be new to bitcoin.  You call a 5% decrease a dip?
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:52:03
I'm a billionaire in Zimbabwean dollar too.
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:58:56
You can improve you credit rating buy just having it for a long period of time without missing any payments.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:50:18
So I only have to wait on average 10 minutes for the bitcoin confirmations to start pumping?  Lovely.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:41:18
I like bits.
1 satoshi = .00000001 BTC.  Smallest unit.  Like a penny.
100 satoshi = 1 bits.  Like a dollar.
1,000,000 bits = 1 BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:01:18
Yup.  These people that need cash advance can also buy bitcoins.  :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:06:58
BS.  BlackCoin address starts with a B.  It would have failed the checksum.  The bitcoin client would not have allowed you.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:46:54
Litecoin.
