My company's 401k is with TA. I'm interested to know what happened. Especially since I'm cashing it in this month to invest in Cryptos Before anyone wants to say I'm irresponsible it's no where near a significant amount of money.

Psychologically it's good. It spreads awareness but the futures have zero tie to Bitcoin. The futures trades settle in cash and therefore shouldn't have an affect on the price of Bitcoin. It's just a way for the futures exchange to make money on people placing bets on the direction of the price of Bitcoin at some point in the future.

Taxation is theft.

After some time though how will it be anything more? Unless the futures contracts settle in the actual asset, Bitcoin, I don't see this being anything other than a bet on the direction. The futures market is more like binary option than an actual future contract.

"short Bitcoin, bring the price down" is the part I have difficulty with. The futures aren't being settled in anything but cash. It's more like you said, gambling on the price, not actually tied to the price in any meaningful way. The futures is where speculation will run wild. It's a way for the banks to claim to be in the market without actually being in the market.

My friends, late 20s low 30s, were just bashing all Cryptos. They have no idea. I have no patience to argue with people about it. It's like I said the other day about people being skeptical. Go ahead, be skeptical cuz I'm out her making all sorts of skeptical dolla dolla bills y'all.

I love the article underneath it is about Peter Shill stating Bitcoin has no value.

I have a feeling this isn't going to work out very well, the dips will be bought.

Here we go. The only reason needed to ban crypto in America.

Update us. But my prediction is they won't do shit for you.

Man, I missed this one

He's a piece of shit. Manipulating the market downard spouting bullshit while his traders overseas bought up the dip. Master manipulator. His bank was the only one "clearing" Madoff trades. Fuck this guy! He's always been a piece of shit...but if you're not cheating, you're not trying, right?

Certainly possible. I wonder though why when the computer is scanned nothing is found. Not to get off topic from cryptos but I've scanned many times and never found any malware which is when I decided Bitdefender is crying wolf.

Bitdefender is nothing if not a massive pain in the ass. Blocked my printer when I installed the newest version. Did all the fucking around I could find online nothing worked. The software constantly blocks my banking, credit card, student loan websites. I override all blocks. The software is the boy who cried wolf. Blocks YouTube and every other site I access. I have the free version now and still have these issues.

Coinmarketcap aggregates the price of a coin based on prices for the coin from multiple exchanges. Coin Coinbase is one such exchange. 
Last time I checked coinbase is the most user friendly. You will not be able to purchase anonymously if that is your goal though.
