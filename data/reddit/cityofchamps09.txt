Don't shame people for how they acquire their pets. Sometimes adoption isn't in the cards for certain people.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:38:33
You might be right at home there.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:33:55
I have educated myself. All breeders are not puppy mill breeders, you ignorant twat. You go and meet the parents of the puppy and the breeder. You interview the breeder, she interviews you and your family. They care about the dogs as much as you do. 
I've looked at rescues, shelters, and breeders and in the rescues and shelters, you adopt a dog that you do not fully know. That is a fact.
So, keep on spouting your own ignorance on the internet while calling out other people's "ignorance" as if I didn't do my own due diligence. You sure drew a lot of false conclusions from a couple of sentences.

Sure thing! [Start here!]( Andreas is an awesome dude explaining what BTC is and how it works. Check out his books [The Internet of Money]( and [The Internet of Money Volume Two.](
Also, [here's a pretty good ELI5 about BTC]( Read this comment and the one right after as the user ran out of space in the original comment due to the character limit.

I mean, sure, but for a short time like a week an intermediary wallet such as Mycelium works fine.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:29:37
You have a different opinion and perspective than I do, and that's okay. Cool! Have a great day, buddy! 
Next time, try not being so judgemental because someone has different preferences than you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:35:56
Nah, I have two small kids and two fixed cats. A shelter dog is not an option for us because I don't want to put my sons at risk from a dog with issues, but please keep stoking the hivemind.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:26:30
Thank you! People need to quit shaming others for their personal preferences. Take care of and love your pets. It doesn't matter where they are from, they all need homes.

Breeders and puppy mills are two entirely different things but American Reddit likes to dump the two together as often as possible to muddy the waters.
Just so we are clear Reddit I'm not advocating for puppy mills and pet stores, at all...
Breeders -- OK    
Rescuing -- OK, but not for everyone    
Puppy mills -- Not OK    
Pet shops -- Not OK

With certain wallets, yes that is true. Mycelium wallets change addresses every time you send or receive, however, people can still use your previous addresses to send you coin, thankfully. It's a pretty neat system.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:52:17
And you can add being a judgemental prick to the things that you are in denial of about yourself!
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:33:26
No it isn't. Take me for example. I've been looking around for a dog. Including at shelters. 95% of the time, a shelter dog is an adult or almost adult dog that someone else has trained/owned/etc. I'm not going to go adopt one that has possible past issues from a shelter with two small kids. 
It just is not happening. I want a dog with a six and two year old. The best option for us is a puppy from a breeder. 
I'm a responsible pet owner and my two cats were fixed whenever we were first able to get them fixed at six months right on the nose. Neither of them are allowed outside and I trim their claws instead of getting them tortured with declawing.
So, no, not everyone has that card.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:00:46
So opinions are wrong now, eh? Personal preference is wrong? Keep @_date: 2017-12-06 01:21:39
Google and Youtube are your friends.
Make a coinbase account and you can buy BTC and ETH there, so that takes care of the first two.. The other two you will have to do some research on as I've never heard of them myself.

Finally, some sanity in a reply. Going up against the hive mind is rough... Haha.
My friend just got his Golden from a breeder. They went to the breeder 3 different times (not counting obedience classes). 
They went up to do a face-to-face with the breeder and meet the Mom and Dad for the litter. The breeder interviewed them as well as took any of the questions my friend had. They gave their deposit at this time.
They then went up a week before the pups came home to pick out their puppy, and again, to interview with the breeder and ask any other questions. All of the families that were getting a pup were there, so as a group, they got to ask many questions, some of which my friend hadn't even thought of.
Finally, they went up to get their puppy. They signed a contract with the breeder that they would take the puppy back if they weren't feeling it, that they would come to obedience classes for the pup (that were included in the cost of the puppy), and that they would get the pup fixed ASAP and send her proof, otherwise she would take back the puppy.
Reddit doesn't get that not all breeders are puppy mill breeders. Reputable breeders care as much, if not more than the families that take their dogs.

No problem! Another option is Electrum on PC. Both are solid wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:11:25
Thank you! I might be buying some IOTA on payday. Looks promising.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:53:28
I wasn't aware of this until today (and this thread), but holy shit, this is spot on.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:53:59
LMAO. You are awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:20:52
Sounds like you need to switch banks/CUs.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:13:48
Damn was over halfway to that first payout threshold to an external wallet, too. What a shame. At least I'm only out my electricity costs for the past two weeks. Oh, well. A lot of people who kept their BTC in the internal wallets are out a lot more than I am, sorry for your losses.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:09:25
You're SOL like we all were with externals, I'm afraid. That unpaid balance was still being held on NH until payout days, which are Fridays, once a week once you hit 0.01. I lost $80 and the electricity I was using, but I didn't really lose anything but electricity since I never hit that threshold. I was about 0.003 away due on 12-15 or 12-22.

Install Mycelium on your mobile device and send your coins there.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:32:31
Congratulations. Doesn't mean adopting is for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:45:13
Wasn't really that sick of a diss, more just being a smug dick.


Oh? Well, then, it seems like Murrumiau qualifies:




Jerking themselves off because they think that they are so fucking brilliant and smug for rescuing special needs and senior animals and since they do it that way, then everyone that acquires a pet needs to adopt too.
edit: [Also, this]( Sounds like to the T.

I don't know if I believe this. That support page was created only 2 days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:48:14
Not a problem! Let me know if you need anymore info!
