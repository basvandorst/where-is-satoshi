Your new here. You should just trust the veterans.
I dont blame you though, everybody has to learn it themselves. Its an expensive lesson. Especially when coinbase reports your short term activity trading to the IRS which they do do. So depends on what amounts of money your dealing with, it can go from 20% long term tax, to damn near 40% short term tax

No. BAAKT isn't just going to take a massive short position by taking the other side of large long orders. If the price starts to stray from spot, arbitrage sellers will buy physical and sell to the guys looking to go long on 100,000 BTC. It's a form of market making.

Yes we had year long bear markets in hindsight. How many times do the shorts get blown out trying to find a bear market? You only realize it's a bear market after the fact. Look how many times BTC looked like it was turning into a bear market and then went on to rip faces.
And also look how many times BTC ripped during the bear market. Good luck being able to hold short through those, and if you did, you most certainly ate it when BTC actually hit another bull market.
So not only do you need to time the beginning of the bear market, you have to time the end of it also. Good luck

There may be no economic incentive for a miner to do it, but there would be for the BTC community to do it. They could start a fund that raises "X" dollars through donations to destroy BCH and BSV and pay the donations to the miners.

Stop losses are a bad idea. When you hit your stop loss, usually its in an area that everybody else hit theirs too. So a bunch of market sell orders hit and your stop of say $9999 ends up being executed at $9880

There may be some differences between this and the DAO, but there are a lot a lot of similarities.
The biggest similarity with the DAO, is it wasn't just a private organization that was effected. IT EFFECTED ANY ETH HOLDER. The amount of ETH that was put into the hands of one actor pretty much guaranteed the market to be fucked for years to come. Saying it only effected DAO people is just not true.

@_date: 2018-09-26 12:37:00
WTF are you talking about. This bug has been around for 2 years and was most likely put their on purpose. Your telling me someone who knew how to exploit it could have made more money just by HODLIN their own BTC?
GTFO, they could have printed endless amounts of BTC and cashed out. You think they give a flying fuck if the ecosystem is damaged after they are sitting on their multiple yachts holding all fiat?

Ya, but how much did they steal?
They same fucks who put the bug in have basically said "just trust us , nothing bad happened". It's insanity.
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:53:55
But the whole issue is that the price is derived from exchanges which can be manipulated. Mt. Gox for example.
I don't agree with it, because essentially everything in any market can be manipulated, but the reasoning for denying the ETF hasn't changed, and the Bakkt prices are subject to the same things the ETF prices would be.
@_date: 2018-09-21 03:43:21
Blows my mind they keep wasting their time with this shit. They'll probably stop when they realize it doesn't effect the market anymore, so they can't insider trade.

The fact that the hashrate can increase by 15% in a month goes to show the network is actually pretty small. 
Everything is relative. 1 trillion gigahashes may sound like a lot, but it's not that much if some $500 chip can do that.
The fact that the bitcoin network which has been being built for years, can be increased by 15% in one month shows it's still small as shit.
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:30:48
Could have said the network was massive 6 months ago. Yet it's increased almost 400% in less then 6 months. So is it massive now? Essentially what I'm saying is if you can keep the network growing at exponential rates, it isn't all that big.
You can build a building. Then double it by making another building and so on. With time you have a HUGE city. That huge city isn't possible to increase by 400% in a short amount of time because of it's shear size.
I mean hell, the hashrate increased by 15% in 2 weeks alone just a couple weeks ago. At that rate, whoever is doing it could produce chips secretly and bring them all online at once and essentially destroy BTC in under 2 months. It's not in their best interest to do so, so it most likely won't happen. The bottom line though is that if hashrate can be doubled so easily it's really not that big of a network.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:05:19
It says " a total of 10 bitcoin-related funds are being weighed by SEC officials, according to public records, although the VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF is the only "physical" ETF among all the proposals."
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:12:48
You've got it ass backwards. If the network can increase at such a fast rate, it means it's actually very small. It's all relative. Who gives a shit about 1 gazillion hashes if it only costs $500 to do that? It's just a number.
If someone comes out with a cheap chip that can double the hashrate of the entire network, yes the network hashrate doubles, but the size/secuirty actually shrinks because it can now be attacked with producing a couple chips.
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:21:21
There's certain things where you have to draw the line and respect your parents wishes. This is not one of those things.
Your 17 and it's your money. Go for it. In fact, anyone who is 17 years old and afraid to buy BTC with their own money because their parents told them not to will most likely not amount to much. You should have been making these types of decisions for yourself for some time now. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:54:59
If they approve an ETF it will most likely be one backed by air, not physical BTC which IMO is complete bullshit and will actually hurt the market. 
So everyone jumping for joy for an ETF needs to realize that the banksters will surely choose the ETF that hurts BTC.

If it's so fucking massive, how can it double in size in a month?

Bovada, Bodog, which is now called Ignition is the biggest US facing site. Also Americas card room. A few months ago Ignition did a big BTC deposit bonus to try and encourage people to learn to use BTC. Well it worked. There are some poker forums with hundreds of people asking how they use BTC to get the bonus. They are all hooked on it now for a couple main reasons. If you try and withdraw via check, you can only do it once every 4 months and it can take a month to receive even after requesting it. Youc an request BTC every 3 days and you receive it within a day. So everyone uses BTC now.

Pretty simple.. make money playing poker online. Being a pro, I'm privy to the industry. Players need to transfer money all the time and neteller and paypal and things like that used to be the method. Now BTC is the method. Wasn't long ago none of them used it and now that they see it's so useful and easy, they all use it. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:56:58
While the etf approval probably has a lot to do with the recent run-up, it's not the reason for the massive run-up. I believe a huge factor has been the fact that people are actually using BTC now. I play online poker professionally and the preferred method of money transfers to/from the sites is BTC. This started maybe 6 months ago. There are loads of people who learned how to use and are now using BTC to deposit and withdraw from poker sites. The fact that it has been adopted in this manner is a big deal, it's not just sites saying, "oh you can spend your btc here".

ETH will let you be your own bank for a fraction of the cost. Also much faster transaction times. Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin, it's just that with the rising fees and slow transaction times, there is a need for something else. Bitcoin essentially took over gold. It does a ton of things better then gold. Well now ETH will take over bitcoin like bitcoin did gold. Bitcoin will still be arouns just like gold is, ETH will gain market share.

In the history of technology, how many times did the first thing be the one that outlasted everyone. Yes it's happened. But with something like bitcoin, it would only make sense something else would improve upon it. When I started using it years ago I was like "why the fuck do the transactions take so long". I learned to deal with it. In todays day and age that wait time just won't fly. Shit should be almost instant.
Honestly bitcoin will be like an old movie camera people used to film their kids with.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:14:59

Suit yourself. Everyone has a choice, they can use ETC if they want. Looks like people understand why they did what they did as ETH has put ETC into the dust. Makes me happy.
Their integrity lies in the fact they are trying to make the best possible network they can. They knew someone controlling too many coins would fuck things up long term so they took action. I guess they could have just dumped all their ETH, scrapped the whole project, let everyone burn and start a new one.
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:51:03
No vendor accepts it yet anyway. All it takes is for a big processor like bitpay or coinbase to add it and next thing you know you can spend it anywhere you can bitcoin. Shapeshift lets you use it. Bitcoin has already proven they don't even want to be used for everyday payments. So somebody else is going to have to do it. Paying 30 cents at the moment for an everyday payment is just stupid. Transferring large sums of money.. no big deal. Buying something for $25, then it doesn't work.

Stock to flow makes no sense. Unless I'm misunderstanding something, they are claiming its better for price to have inflation cut from .5% to .25% in a halvening then from 50% to 25%. That is completely ass backwards. Each halvening will have less and less impact as it becomes a much less % reduction of the overall float

So far as we know, this run is being driven by real money.

The larger the % hashrate increases, the smaller it actually shows the bitcoin network is. If something can increase 15% in size in 2 weeks, it isn't all that big. Someone got a hold of some new more efficient chips. Also remember that just because hashrate is increasing, doesn't mean the network is growing stronger. 
Everything is relative. If I built a chip that increased the hashrate by 30%, it means the network is actually small as hell now if just me can increase it that much.

@_date: 2019-08-21 13:07:39
You people are so hung up on hashrate. Hashrate is relative. Just because its higher, doesnt mean its more secure. Say 6 years ago hashrate was 100 TH, but it took 100,000 of the best chips across the world to do it. 
Then 10 years later chips vastly improved and hasrate went to 1 billion TH, but it took 10,000 of the best chips across the world to do that. Which network is more secure?
Looking at the number alone means nothing. As a matter of fact, its actually a good sign when hashrate is decreasing because it means people are more likely to buy btc, then to buy miners. Its really pretty simple. Also, hashrate is 100% a lagging indicator. Hashrate follows price. Watching the hashrate go up in no wat indicates price will follow

@_date: 2019-10-17 18:21:02
Where you are totally wrong is that yes 63 million is a much larger number, buts it a much much lower % cut compared to market cap.
Think of it this way, if inflation was cut from 50% to 25%, that is a massive reduction compared to overall float. The actual dollar amount means nothing.
Now think if inflation was cut from .5% to .25%. It is still a halving, but the overall effect will be MUCH less. Every having will have less and less effect.
@_date: 2019-10-18 02:16:37
"Hardly anyone sells" existing stock is very scientific. What you need to realize is that it takes less and less % to sell after each halving. If inflation gets knocked down to 1%, all it takes is 1% of the people to sell their supply to match the cut.
When inflation cut from 20% to 10%, it would take 10% of people to sell their stock.
If none of that makes any sense, we can exaggerate the situation. You are saying it would be better for inflation to be cut from .02% to .01% as opposed to 10% to 5%.

No I don't think it's all hype. I think A LOT of money buys in anticipation of the halving. Then when it halves, yes there's half the supply oncoming, but there's no more people buying in anticipation of the halving, as a matter of fact, they are sellers now, especially when the price starts to fall. This is the type of scenerio that would cause a price drop rather then rise after a halving.

The "hacker" was playing by the rules of the game and beat bitcoin and they decided to change the rules and take away his money. Doesn't sound immutable to me! CODE IS CODE

Exchange volume is BS. All it takes is the house to put up 10,000 BTC and have the house buy the 10,000 BTC, and voila, you have massive volume at 0 cost. You really think there was a massive tick in volume like that and no movement in price???

That game is long gone. The big players have arbitrage on lock down now.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:03:34
Hash Rate is relative. A higher number doesn't mean a more secure network. If someone came out with a super chip tomorrow that doubled the hashrate, BTC wouldnt be more secure, it would be less secure.
Also, it's better for price when the hashrate is decreasing. When its increasing it means its still profitable for miners to spend their money on more miners to accumulate BTC. When the hashrate is decreasing, it means its not profitable for miners, therefore if they want to accumulate BTC, they have to buy it.
This is why its really bad for BTC when it becomes SUPER profitable to mine.

Bitcoin should clearly be labeled as a currency, like Japan has made it. You don't have to pay taxes on every fucking transaction for a currency.
Its complete BS. They also want you to pay taxes on all forks and any airdrops that people throw at you at the time of receiving them, not selling them. How absurd is that. 
Someone needs to airdrop some IRS guys 10 millions coins of their new shitcoin which is priced at $1 on some low volume exchange, and then just sell some of theirs and drop the price to .00001. Now the IRS dude owes on $10 million on something thats worthless.

I'm not comparing it to other commodities. I'm comparing it to itself in last halvings. Each halving will have less and less effect. As I've stated in other responses, we can exaggerate the scenerio. A halving from .02% down to .01% surely will not have as big as impact as a halving from 10% down to 5%.
JUST LIKE a halving from 4% to 2% will not have as a big as an effect as 8% down to 4% as the last halving was.

I see people everywhere insinuating the halving will be just as big as any.

All this talk of how much is invested in BTC is bad news. Brian Armstrong from coinbase brags about how signing up like 50,000 users a day (which I think is a big lie) and how many hundreds of millions flow in from institutions.
Well thats great and all, but what that means is that has to keep happening and then some for the price to rise. Thats what drove us high, now everyone is all invested and no one to buy up the coins that keep spitting out on a daily basis
@_date: 2019-12-03 00:58:58
The main problem/difference between BTC and gold is that if gold falls to a certain price, people stop mining it if it's not profitable, so there is a floor. 
In BTC, the supply keeps coming no matter what the price. Thus 0 is the floor.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:20:41
How does it cost 2x more to mint when rewards drops in half? Hashrate will drop also until the point of profitably. So if hashrate has been steady for months leading into halving, you could expect it to drop 30-50% depending on how the price of BTC acts.
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:00:42
When you have hedge funds/investors speculating and investing hundreds of millions/billions driving up the price, guess what happens when they stop investing all that money.

The huge difference is the companies that take delivery keep things in line. This isn't going to allow anyone to take delivery. Makes absolutely no sense.

@_date: 2019-12-31 04:12:07
Say I have 1k to invest in BTC per month. So I buy 1k per month.
How is the halving priced in if there are a lot of people that do that? Your assuming that the amount of people speculating on the halving and buying a bunch extra who are planning on selling after the halving are equal to the amount of people buying for other reasons then the halving.
It's just like the title says, it's a change in the whole physics of the game and it can only be priced in after it has happened. I'd say 6 months - 1 year after the halving, it will be priced in.
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:03:38
This is exactly why price is likely to go down. The institutional money is in!  If they invested 1 billion dollars, that means institutions need to keep investing to keep the price up. Obv at some point the fad gets boring and institutions stop putting so much in and maybe even start to pull out and the price tanks.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:02:52
Being "priced in" and "knowing about it" are 2 completely different things.
The way it really works, is the halving happens, and the price will go up or down and after a period of time it will have "price discovery' AND THEN IT WILL BE PRICED IN!.
@_date: 2019-12-25 14:52:24
You can't make this shit up. "Most crypto is in very strong hands". Maybe so, go ahead and double the price and start to drop it again and see how strong those hands are.

This type of stuff is bad too see. You realize that if hundreds of millions from institutions flowed into BTC and it's at 7200. That means in order to stay at 7200, just as much needs to continue to flow in.

Yes, this is very true. Bitcoin is much easier to send then a wire. However banks seem to know they need to make some changes and things like Ripple, will most likely make it so banks can do it instantly. Not just a wire, but converting currencies as well. I'm not advocating Ripple or anything, there are just different use cases for different types of crypto.
So eventually banks will be much better at transferring money then they are now.
Bitcoins greatest thing it has going for it is not ease of transfer, but the fact it is peer to peer, not backed by any government, can't be inflated, can't be counterfeited. So yes, ease of transfer is nice, but when the banks make transferring much easier, bitcoin will not die.

Holding BTC is nothing like holding gold. The big difference in why gold is a store of value and BTC is not, is that when the price of gold drops below the cost of mining, all mining stops and production halts to 0. Thus a bottom is put in.
With BTC, when the price drops, miners drop out and it becomes cheaper to mine. It will always be profitable for someone to mine and BTC will just keep spitting out coins no matter how low the price. This is why BTC has no bottom and isnt a store of value.
@_date: 2019-04-18 05:13:47
LOL, yes yes it has to retrace at some point.
Although, there will be 1 time that it doesn't. Look at the charts, you can actually see it's happened multiple times where any shorter will run out of money long before any retracement.

I'm not saying it puts downward pressure, but it will put much less upward pressure. And if people have been investing thinking there's going to be some massive upward pressure from a small halving that they all think will have some huge effect like the lasts ones, we may be in for a big drop when it doesn't happen.
Lower inflation is good overall, but when BTC is at a current price and you cut inflation by much less, it's not as good for price then if you cut inflation by a lot more. 
Cutting from 50% to 25% is a 25% cut on overall float inflation. Cutting from .05% to .025% is a cut of .025% inflation on the overall float. It is almost nothing. What kind of effect do you think cutting inflation from .0005% to .000025% would be? I know that's an exaggeration but all common sense knows it would have virtually no effect and it clearly proves the point right. EVERY HALVING WILL HAVE LESS EFFECT.

Bitfinex has been by far the biggest shadiest exchange. It always comes down to shit like this with them. They always profit off it to make up for the short comings.
For instance, they say they made "everyone whole" with BFX token. BULL FUCKING SHIT. BFX TOKEN WAS TRADING AT 30 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. YOU WERE ONLY MADE WHOLE IF YOU HELD IT UNTIL THEY PAID IT ALL OFF WHICH NO ONE KNEW WOULD OR WOULDN'T HAPPEN.
Now they are profiting by selling BTC at $5375 while the rest of the market is at $5140. They control the flow of funds so they make sure they are the only ones who can get fiat off. So they Buy btc elsewhere, sell on Bitfinex and make a ton of money on the arb and transfer the money off and do it over and over again.
It's super odd that shorts on Bitfinex have been oddly skyrocketing out of no where. It was most likely Bitfinex themselves shorting knowing this was coming. Shorts just kept piling on into the BTC rally. Never seen anything like it and found it so strange and now this.
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:22:53
This only works if the price of BTC stays the same or goes down. If BTC goes up, they lose their ass because they are essentially naked shorting if they go to a fractional reserve.
This is what I feel the CME futures did. However, BTC possibly weeded out most speculation and found a real bottom where physical BTC is needed. 
Now, the futures can't just print it out of thin air and short it because the physical price is going up. I mean they could, but they will lose. So if people start going long in the futures and no one in their right mind wants to short BTC in a massive bull market, the price may get a bit out of whack. So there will be an arb opportunity in which traders could buy physical BTC to back the shorts they sell on the futures market. This will create a massive demand for physical, thus driving the price up even more.
The reason why it worked better on gold is because nobody really wanted their physical gold, and it honestly isn't used all that much. BTC is a whole different thing.

This is where you see how "money works". Its a psychological thing. Proof of burn didn't catch on, bitcoin did. 
The usd sucks dick but it won the psychology war.
Bitcoin seems to be doing well in the psychology war. The fact it has decent fundamentals is even better.

Gemini charges 1.4% or something near that. I think these ridiculous rates are a sign of a huge decrease in demand and companies still trying to keep their profits. 
Coinbase pro went from 0 maker fee to .5%! And regular coinbase advertises their fees like this. .99 for up to $10. Because they dont want to show fucking 10% fee.
Kraken has the lowest fees and you should go with them.

Not necessarily. It's the amount of fiat that makes a network secure. Not the number of coins.
Spew out less coins, the price goes up, the same amount of fiat is given to the miners.

It's not really as bad as you think. Naked shorting stuff only works when the price of BTC has already been inflated by speculation. Speculation will always weed itself out and BTC will find a true bottom where real world use is the real demand. When this happens, the price will start to go up, however now, anybody who naked shorts it will lose their ass. 
So when speculators start to jump in, traders/market makers will have to buy physical BTC to arb and short it to keep the markets in line with the physical BTC price. 
Only when the market is severely overpriced and going down or sideways does naked shorting work.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:36:22
Everyone would start with the same amount of BTC as they have now. 
And where do you ever hear this statement to be true? I mean Satoshi has 1mil+ coins but that hasn't slowed adoption down. Nobody really knows how many coins early adopters have. One just gave away $1mil worth for solving a puzzle!

Speeding is illegal, yet you don't get the death penalty. Life sentences are for VIOLENT CRIMES. He did nothing violent. 
What he did may have been illegal, but it doesn't constitute the punishment.

He made a website, people sold drugs on it. (NON VIOLENT)
With that mentality, technically the internet facilitated everything and should be shut down.
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:36:00
You don't get the death penalty for getting pulled over for speeding. As also you should not get 2 life sentences for profiting off of drugs. Especially on a first time offense.
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:37:52
PROFITING of something is not remotely close to killing people.
He made money. He did no violent crime whatsoever.
Yes people may have OD'd. That's not on him. He ran a website that other people took part in the transactions. 
Anybody that claims that he's responsible for OD's or anything of the sorts is a jackass. They were 3rd party deals. If you think he's responsible for OD's then the inventor of the internet should get the death sentence because they are responsible for anything that's ever taken place on the internet.

You believe that shit? The feds wanted to increase their case so they frame him with shit like that. Hell, a couple of the agents are in prison for stealing many of the BTC. They have proven themselves to be liars and thieves. How can you trust anything they say? And they will be doing petty little sentences.

Where the fuck would they get the $438 from if BTC went to 0?? It just appears out of thin air from a bankrupt company?
It's a free roll on the companies part.. everything goes to 0 and they don't have to pay anything because they have nothing. Everything goes to billions and you only have to pay a small portion? That is beyond retarded.

They technically didn't pay everyone back on the hack. They got "hacked" and socialized the losses and gave people bullshit BFX tokens in place of their money. Those tokens traded at 30 cents on the dollar for a long time. Nobody knew if they would go to 0 or back up. So you only got your money back if you took the risk and held the BFX token for I cant remember how long.
On top of that, crypto was going up 100s of %. So instead of making a bunch of money on crypto that the people were suppose to have, their money was in an IOU bullshit BFX token.
And they play it off like everyone got paid back in full. Just another lie of many lies they've had. STAY AWAY!

Doesn't matter if there is legit guys. The fact that there was corrupt FBI agents involved, taints the entire case. Pretty simple. Who's to say what really happened.
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:43:00
Even if everything you say is true and he wasnt framed. He still wasnt charged with that, and even if he was, what do people who try murder for hire get as sentencing? 2 life sentences?
The bottom line is he wasnt even charged with that so it should be off the slate entirely.
He got 2 life sentences by a bunch of fucking proven liars/thiefs. You need to stop and think what smart criminals in the FBI are capable of. Producing false evidence surely can't be put past them.

You people are delusional about mining btc. It is way better for it to be unprofitable tp mine btc. This is because if you want to invest in btc, you then buy the coins and not mining equipment.
If it is super profitable to mine btc, miners dont just hold the coins as you state, they instantly buy more mining equipment with them. Even long term hodlers might buy some mining equipment.
It is 100% better for mining to be unprofitable. I mean hell, id what you say is true, the halving could almost have a negative effect on price because at that moment mining becomes super unprofitable.

You sent BTC to sell for USD on an exchange that isn't allowing USD withdrawals? I can see the merit it in, but seems like a lot of risk for a little reward especially from someone with a reputation like Bitfinex.
Also, you now will miss the whole BTC move to the upside!?!?!?! Sitting on fiat right now is the worst thing you can do, especially fiat in Bitfinex, cmon now.
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:08:59
You can withdraw coins, but at a 7% or so rip because you have to buy at a a much higher price on Bitfinex then you can actually sell for cash on other exchanges

@_date: 2019-05-22 12:17:09
Yes they can do this as I'm guessing they did in the futures market. All they do is weed out speculation to a point. Once BTC bottoms out to it's true need for physical BTC, good luck naked shorting then.
When the price of physical starts to rise, no one in the market wants to naked short because they will lose their ass. There may be arb opportunities though where the fund price starts to rise more then physical, so people can short the fund and buy physical to keep things aligned. In the end though, this results in the shorters buying physical so it drives the price up even more.

Because they were drowning in their paper shorts on the futures market, so they release the news the day before expiration so they can cash settle them at a discount.

LOL, good to hear they are upgrading their security against "phishing". What a fucking joke. They were suppose to be the best.
The fact 7000 BTC could be transferred out at one time is ridiculous, I don't care if it was over multiple accounts.  The other fact the the "hackers" know exactly what the limits and how to do this wreaks of an inside job.
So when they "fix" everything, it'll be hacked again because the insider know everything.

Shorting only works until BTC bottoms where the demand for physical BTC is greater then the supply. For instance it worked on the way down from 20k, but no longer works. Anybody who is naked shorting now is losing their ass.
In order to create a market and keep it in line with physical BTC, they can arb by buying physical BTC and shorting in their market. In the end though, this still requires them to buy the real thing.

That is a very logical thought. You take a case where we are 100% sure there were corrupt FBI agents involved, and then you take whatever else "evidence" these corrupt officers had and believe it to be real.
Get your head out of your ass. There are fucking "smart" people out there. Especially FBI agents. FBI agents are smart AND CORRUPT.
