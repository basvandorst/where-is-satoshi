lmao, someone's trying to keep bch steady. they've been artificially raising the price all day, but keep getting dumped on. It's been like clockwork. They sell their btc, pump it into bch, get dumped on, repeat.  
  
they're trying to make it looklike bch is rising when btc falls and btc is falling when bch falls. They've done pretty good keeping the price below 17k and bch above 3.4k, but now they're losing steam and these coins values are starting show.

go to c:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\bitcoin and copy the wallet.dat file. You need to get this file to a different computer. Best to use a USB. Download the Bitcoin Core client on a new computer and replace the wallet.dat file with your old one and fire it up.

It makes me laugh/cry at people asking Ron Paul why he doesn't believe people deserve healthcare. They cannot wrap their minds around the fact people can't afford the bloated whale of our medical bills because healthcare and pharmaceuticals are in bed with our government, using doublespeak buzz words like "regulation" and "freedom" and "welfare" to justify their agenda. They can't look at the whole picture and can only frame their reference in left vs right and can't see the whole system is bleeding them dry. You give people a sound currency in a system that makes it impossible for a relationship between corporation/government to exist would make our medical bills negligent.  
  
You say government shouldn't meddle in the economy, and they automatically think your talking GOP doublespeak where not meddling in the economy really means giving tax subsidies to corporations. They can't see the beauty of a system where corporations aren't jerking off our politicians.  
  
But, what do I know? Let's keep arguing about trans using bathrooms or gun rights or whatever the hell else keeps people angry.

Let me ask you this and I really want you to think about it honestly.  
  
If Bcash was named...Newcash or Bluecoin Cash, and didn't participate in manipulating people to believe it's bitcoin, how much do you think it'd be worth right now? That number is it's real value. That is where you're heading. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:21:35
could you explain to a dummy why that means a low chance of these hedge funds dumping?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:30:15
What said is exactly on the point. In our current system, raising taxes only increases the amount of subsidies given to corporate interest. Our politicians are all crony capitalist. Libertarians advocate a complete separation in the relationship between corporation and government. I think most libertarians go too far when they advocate no taxes, but the great minds that fueled the core ideology of the party never really advocated such a thing. Milton Friedman laid down a very specific idea for what the role of government should be in a society, and that included policing, national security and welfare. I think a Lot of people confuse libertarians with anarchists. Ron Paul was a lot of things, but disingenuous he was not. I agree he went too far in many ways, but I knew that his opinions he preached were his own and not Verizon's or BPs or any other corporate donors. That is a rare thing in this day and age. He didn't deserve the treatment he got.

could you imagine living in a world where Roger Ver is respected.  
  
think about it.  
  
You're having a conversation with some dude about your favorite ice cream and you say something along the lines of "I like vanilla." and the dude flips his shit yelling how you're censoring him and that you're not a true believer in chocolate and started trying to talk over you everytime you said anything because you're a vanilla loving socialist. 
  
You'd try to tell him, "Chill out dude, it's a big world. Some people like chocolate and others vanilla," and then he'd start going off on how he's a true leader for the chocolate cause and that he demands to be respected and if you won't listen to him he'll leave.    
  
EDIT: I forgot the part where he thinks chocolate is vanilla with some food coloring on it.

LMAOOOOOOOO, BCASH can't even break 3700 even with coordinated scheduled pushes. The volume you're seeing is awfully consistent isn't it? This looks more like a metronome beat than a volume indicator!  It just keeps getting dumped :] No faith in BCASH. The price is dropping, and just wait until whoever is behind these coordinated pushes runs out of steam.

The fact we've stayed over 16k for the most part is amazing. I've been watching coordinated sell offs at every 100 increment (aggregate your gdax orderbook and look at them develop on spikes). BCASH has coordinated buy walls too, just take a look when the price dips and look how BTC sells off and immediately support buy walls start to show up. Yesterday they doing this at every 100 increment, but now they have to do it at every 50 and soon it will be every 10. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:33:23
I've been trying to tell everyone to calm down and look at the charts. There is obviously an orchestrated push to keep BCH above 3000, but it can't last forever. Even with them selling off mass amounts of their bitcoin and artificially inflating bcash's price, they've failed to keep the price above 3500. There isn't enough support buying into these coordinated pushes and they're just getting dumped on. It's not sustainable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:40
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! LETS GO BOY CHEAP BTC COMIN AT YA
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:42
well we're saying to observe the charts and notice the price is artificially inflated by coordinated pumps. It's value is way too high, and the only reason its found support is because there is a coordinated effort to stay above 3k. Look at the order book, watch the coordination between BTC sell offs and BCH buys. There is a massive sell off of BCH that is causing it to decrease even though 40-50 BTC is being sold off every 100 increment to pump into BCH.

Hear me out right now, come the end of Jan when the next "Flippening" attempt happens, you'll be kissing my feet I made you so much money.

yall really letting a few rich pockets FUD yall out of bitcoin lmao. Any investor worth his salt knows exactly what is going on right now and is either staked in bitcoin our cashed out in fiat waiting for whatever orchestration of people who is artificially inflating bcash to run out of steam, which seems to be happening since they can't even pump the coin above 3700 anymore without selling off 100+ of their bitcoins. BCASH has had like 40 opportunities to go on a run above 4k since yesterday, but nobody has any faith in it and just dumps as soon as it goes on a rise. Look at the pattern, people. It's all in the charts. It's no coincidence 30 of these post show up as soon as bitcoin starts a rise and MF start dumping their shitcoin.

I was just entering adulthood when Ron Paul made his last good run. I don't if it was youthful arrogance, but I fell in hard with Ron Paul. Read all the literature, constantly read articles from the mises institute, read everything by milton friedman. He shaped my political views into my early stages of adulthood. The way the system treated him totally disheartened me to the political system. I lost all faith in the machine. His word rings truer now than ever.
