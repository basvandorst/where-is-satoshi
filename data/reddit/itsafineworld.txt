The technology is still young.  There's so much potential in blockchain and crypto currencies.  You've got a huge leg up on many other investors since you already know about these concepts.  There are people buying into Bitcoin now who know the name but little else.

If it goes to 8k, I'm going to drop my next pay checks into bit coin and eat rice and beans for a month.

What did you expect, it's vice...it's click bait for hipsters.

Hmm, never really had it explained out to me like that, or least my biases towards towards short term made it difficult to see the long term goals.  Thanks!

Awesome!  That's got to feel amazing.  Good for you for getting in early!

Couldn't agree more.  People will point out the loop holes, and this tax advantage, or that write off, but nothing compares to the freedom that comes from being debt free.  I wish more people would embrace it instead of saying things like, "well, you can either use surplus funds to pay of your house that sits at 4.85 percent interest, OR you could invest money into something that pays 4.87 percent and make money!"

I figured i'd drop in a week's worth of coffee money into bitcoin when it was $10k.  Really wishing I hadn't pussied out and dropped 2-3 months worth of coffee money instead.

Man, you're stuff is damn inspirational.  Thanks for sharing!

I was thinking the same thing.

So i have about a month of time off that is going to get cashed out when I leave my job in two weeks...I think I have an idea of where to put that money...

It's funny how my old man gets the basic idea of bitcoin and can appreciate it but my brother thinks its a gimmick.  Guess growing up in Latin America in the mid 20th century gives you a good enough idea of how unreliable the establishment can be.

Yeah, but won't some smooth operator know that she's plain and humble, fill her heads with crazy ideas, then have her leave you with all of your bitcoin?

Is this some new copypasta?
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:43:34


My god, sometimes I forget people mined dozens of bitcoins on the same PC they used to shitpost on SomethingAwful.com and play CS 1.6...
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:41:49
You really think someone would lie on the internet?

Waiting for to find something wrong with this.
