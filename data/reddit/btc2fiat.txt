The point of this is that BTC is forced back to fiat, in order to preserve the superior status of fiat, by making BTC only a method of payment and not allowing BTC to become a fully functioning currency.
I call this part of Lawsky's proposal the "who's your daddy" section.

You should file a complaint with the BMO ombudsman, with the Canadian Bankers Association and the Ministry of Consumers for discrimination against you.
When depositing money to the VoS account, you are forced to pay for a more expensive service, while the same service (cash deposit to a bank account) is generally available for other costumers, who deposit money to other accounts.

"BMO spoke to VOS and they stopped the direct deposit in the account as BMO started to be worried."
Worried about what?
"Bank Wire or cheque should be used."
Did BMO stop accepting cash deposit to ALL BMO accounts?
If not - on what basis is BMO DISCRIMINATING against specific account holder?

People are lining up to buy BTC - the difficulty is how to move fiat into BTC (and back). 
I see it as a huge sign of confidence in BTC - whether you call it pump -n dump or not. 
There is a hard core, grass root BTC community, supporting BTC from the beginning - and of course, there are investors (you might see them as speculators) moving into BTC. There is nothing wrong with buying/selling - I don't see any difference when I trade BTC, stock, FX or futures. Speculative money is great, it helps more people get involved, which creates the condition to gradually start using BTC for payments, as well.
Nobody knows the future of BTC - but absolutely everything started up by some people putting their money where their mouth is - and in case of BTC the number of people wanting to see BTC succeed is growing fast. And of course, everybody involved would like to see it making profit. But again - do you invest in anything with the purpose of not making profit?

It is quite expected. There is huge pressure on all the participants in the traditional financial industry to try to sideline bitcoin. 
Registered savings plans are directly linked to taxation - governments control this particular investment type the most closely.
BTC being very speculative, high risk investment is not the best candidate for retirement savings.
It's all good - if you like to take your chances with BTC - do it outside of the retirement saving plan.

VoS is great, professional service.
I wish they had daily low and high stats, if the recently closed orders would be displayed in your preferred time zone - and if they would be included in the different bitcoin charts, apps.

part of the game... for all publicly traded companies, one way or an other.

The question remains: The account is legit, since bank wire, certified cheque is accepted.
What is authorizing then BMO to ban a specific account to use certain deposit method, which is allowed for all the other accounts?
You either stop accepting cash deposit for ALL accounts - or you are discriminating against the customers of a specific account.
It is illegal to discriminate against specific customers, forcing them to pay extra for a service which is available for other customers.

what's in it for you?

There are specific measures in place to control money laundering. 
As far as I am concerned, cash deposit under certain amount is perfectly legal in Canada. 
It is a problem if banks start to introduce their own rules about what is legal what is not. 
They are not legislated to do that, acting as if they were is a suspect criminal act.

"Bitcoin also lacks another characteristic of reserve currencies: confidence, which is usually created through sound monetary policy and regulation.... However, for it to be considered a true currency alternative with broad-based, global use, we would expect it would need the credibility that would come from some governmental or other multinational authority's backing."
It will be quite a shock to realize for people in finance, regulation that the only credibility required to Bitcoin is coming from the public. 
No "governmental or other multinational authority" is required.
The authority is the users of BTC.

More people need to own BTC before it can really function as a currency. No need to force it before it is ready. Slower adaptation, less buzz is more useful on the long run.
Eventually people will decide whether they want and will get it functioning as a currency - or not.
