ChangeTip founder here. We love this idea.
However - it has a problem. The Wikipedia community (which I have ties to) is appropriately very focused on neutrality. If you started tipping individual contributors and/or articles, it would be very difficult to maintain neutrality.

bitcointip is a better name for promoting bitcoin - too bad it's already taken. :) One idea would be to have changetip also listen for requests to bitcointip so that we can use both. It's been suggested. What do folks think?

@_date: 2014-04-03 05:34:04
We've heard this line of feedback before, but keep in mind ChangeTip was designed to work across the whole Internets, not just Reddit. As such, having the login be specific to a particular site doesn't make sense, because then you'd have to maintain a separate wallet for each site. 
For folks focused on tipping on the whole Internet, it's much better.
I'll tip you anyway, you can donate it to  on twitter if you don't want it. :) 1 answer @_date: 2014-03-11 16:49:28

Page for candidate A is getting a lot of tips. Page for candidate B is getting less tips. Which article would be higher quality? People could skew the results on issues by deciding which articles and / or contributors they give money to.

ChangeTip Founder here. To be clear, we didn't build ChangeTip to replace BitcoinTip. We love competition! 
At the end of last year, I saw bitcointip and thought - "This is aweseome; we need to do it for the whole Internet." I spent a few weeks planning, and then I quit my full time job to found ChangeCoin and create ChangeTip. 
We want to uplift the spirit of giving and generosity online, **drive the mass consumer adoption of bitcoin**, and fundamentally change the way that content is produced and consumed with micropayments *using Bitcoin*.
The author of bitcointip, liked it so much he wanted to switch the users over to it. :) Sean has been super helpful, advising us on what [not] to do.
I hear the feedback that it doesn't have bitcoin in the name.  **Let's get constructive**. Idea - ChangeTip could take over listening for and have our bot handle that too, so folks that wanted to make sure that bitcoin was in the name can continue use bitcointip the name, but changetip does the work behind the scenes. 
How does that sound? Any downsides?
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:30:19
Current fee is about $.07, and it's cutting by 1/10 soon, so it will be $.007 per transaction.  does a pretty good job explaining it all.

There are three key reasons why BTC is well suited to tipping online.
1. Works for strangers. I don't need to know who you are to send you money. 
2. Low transaction fees
3. Currency neutral

Aaaand it's done. If you head over to the [tip amounts page]( and you are logged in, you can now add your own monikers. It's currently only live for folks that have their currency set to USD, which you can change on your [account settings]( - were adding support for other currencies soon.

I'm hesitant to post this because I don't want to further reinforce competitiveness between Doge and Bitcoin. A friendly reminder that the ocean is huge, and **we are working together** to drive the adoption of digital currencies. has been a pleasure in all my interactions with him and I wish his team success.
ChangeTip is building a dashboard for publicly available data so everything is transparent. It's hard to find time though, we are also working on features for tipping and new channels! Here's some data in the meantime for the curious.
In the last 30 days:
9,213 tips sent. $18,244.46 - average tip size $1.98
This is only for tips that were *collected*, so not all the tips that were *sent*. Worth noting that our average tip size was closer to $4 until we introduced bits. Since then there has been a lot more doge-style giveaways where people have threads that give away tiny amounts. That's been good for usage overall.
The dogecoin community is far more active in terms of users and tip volume.

Thank you very much. My apologies for breaking the rules.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:11:25

2. Reddit would still have to be in business

ChangeTip allows for tipping. Transactions are offchain, they are free/instant. It works on Reddit, Github, and Twitter. Others coming soon.
I can't wait to be able to tip on YouTube, Soundcloud, etc to support musicians. It's coming!
Here's a coffee on me to try it out. @_date: 2014-02-19 19:16:48

That's the thing, if he was seeking truth, I'd support it. Or, if he was actually trying to make the situation better, I'd support it. 
But neither of those things are true. His comments are motivated by his own ego, at the expense of others. 
He's smart, and I'll listen to what he has to say as fuel, I just have identified a pattern of behavior that I'm unwilling to reward.

Thank you for taking the time to detail this out in such a clear manner. Instead of sweeping Bitcoin's issues under the rug, we need to talk about them openly so they can be resolved.  1 lunch The thing I keep in mind through all of these stumbles is that digital currencies are in their infancy. The problems you list out will be addressed within the next 5 years.
I'd add another issue that we aren't really talking about - **consumer trust**. We can paint the rosiest pictures of MtGox, but it was a huge blow, and we need to work on Bitcion's public image. We need positive use cases for Bitcoin that showcase why it is better than fiat currency. I'm the founder of ChangeTip, a tipping bot for the web, so I'm obviously biased when I say internet tipping is one such use case that can improve Bitcoin's reputation and drive mass consumer adoption of bitcoin.

ChangeTip uses off-chain transactions so that tips are free &amp; instant, and allows for better security practices.

Agreed this would have saved me the pain. I'd rather be able to be more transparent though. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:27:51
1 bit working now! Tech details for the curious: we didn't put this in at first because we also support `a $term` and `another $term`, so we were worried that people would accidentally tip `a bit`. It gets tricky when the word is used in common language, but we're handling that now.

ChangeTip founder here. We work on Github, Twitter, and Reddit, too!
ChangeTip is heavily inspired by and the great work that they've done. the author, is an advisor of ours and [he gives ChangeTip his blessing](
We aim to lift the spirit of generosity and giving online, as well as fundamentally change the way content is produced and consumed. We call it a Love Button for the Internet. Imagine:
* You could tip someone on Quora for giving a high quality, thoughtful answer.
* When someone produces an inspiring video on youtube, you could donate to them by leaving a comment
* When raising money on Facebook for causes, you could just leave a Facebook comment to give $5
* You could support your favorite artists on SoundCloud by giving them $5
* Instead of a blogger making $4 a month on Google AdSense, users could tip them to see the site without ads for 30 days - with 1 click
The real value exchange with content online is between the people producing the content, and the people consuming the content. Let’s create a direct connection - instead of having advertising as the model. Once people see how easy it is to send money to strangers online, we will find a whole new marketplace is being created. Market dynamics say that the overall quality of the content should increase as well.
That’s a taste of what we are up to. We'd love to hear your thoughts! Good feedback will likely receive a tip!
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:36:11

Hey there. 
We just fixed it - the external library we were using to login with reddit started failing suddenly. It looks like Reddit started banning requests like this via their API - so no one could login with Reddit. We've updated the code for the library to better follow Reddit's rules and it is working now.

That title is a bit misleading. A hackathon is common practice for software engineers. It's not hacking in the destructive sense of the word, here *hacking* means to throw something together quickly.
Hackathons are held all over the world, nearly every day, as a way for software engineers to take a pet project that they have been thinking about and knock it out over a short period of time. It's a way to build a prototype very quickly, throwing out all the rules about software quality. The metrics are completeness and cleverness, and the code should be thrown away at the end. Usually there a bunch of like minded people in the room. It's often held over night or over a weekend, with a lot of coffee/red bull.
Funny story - I participated in a "Privacy Hackathon" sponsored by the Wall Street Journal to come together and build projects to protect consumer privacy. WSJ execs apparently didn't like the idea of sponsoring a Hackathon for fear of press like this, so at the last minute the organizers changed it to be called a Codeathon. I have a Tshirt from the event that says "Not a hackathon" on the back. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:35:08
I get that you were joking, but I will answer it anyway. The way the bot works is that we assign a USD value to the monikers, and then convert that to BTC when the tip is created. So it is pegged at the USD value, it's the BTC rate that fluctuates.

If you're going to call me out for what I've done, you should have the whole story. I'm actually a privacy advocate. Here's what I did at Krux:
* Built a pixel blocking technology that prevents advertisers from gathering data from users illegitimately
* Built a product that monitors ads for site owners so they can know who the "bad actors" are; the ones selling data without the our permission
* Built a Firefox plugin (like Ghostery) that allows for users to see where pixels are being dropped and user data is being compromised
* Participated in privacy hackathons and worked with privacy experts in the industry to promote transparency, control, and choice for users so we know where our data is going online.

ChangeTip Founder here. 
Really glad to have this kind of feedback. It helps us to learn where we need to grow so we can make this experience better for everyone. I have a saying - it's not where you are, it's where you are going. Thank you for pushing us to be better.
We've investigated different ideas for how the tip process works. The reason why we don't respond until after they've done something is that to show when the person actually *collected*. However, I agree this makes things weird because it looks like nothing happened. One potential solution is that we post immediately when we find the tip, then *edit* that post when they collect, indicating it's been confirmed. How does this sound?
As for the delays - &gt; 99% of the time the private message will be delivered within 30 seconds. The delays aren't on our side, but with the Reddit API. In the last 72 hours or so, the Reddit API has been very flaky, and it's been painful for us. We've been working to figure out why, and have just made a few changes that make this better. 
We've been working improving the experience for tip collection. We've been working on improving our UX overall. We're a team of geeks, and this was our first version. We aren't happy with it yet either. Expect to see drastic improvements here soon. 
We're doing everything we can to keep all of you happy!
Thanks again - 10 answers @_date: 2014-09-11 19:22:28

I'm not qualified to answer as I am not an online retailer, but what I've heard is that merchants hate chargebacks because they are a hassle, and the credit card companies don't like them either. If an online retailer gets too many chargebacks, the merchant processor will actually halt processing. Someone more qualified on this issue should chime in.

I'm listening to your feedback. 
There needs to be some sort of process for dealing with inactive accounts. It's especially tricky with Bitcoin because we don't have the persons information to return their funds to them in another way. 
What banks do is charge an "account maintenance fee" so that the balance goes to zero eventually. Dislike.
The other option that most financial institutions do is route the funds to the state so they can be claimed - but since we don't have the persons information, we can't do that. 
This procedure hasn't been put in place yet, since we haven't been around long enough for it to happen. As part of the rest of the review of the privacy policy, we will explore options for how to deal with inactive accounts.
I'll get back to you.

ChangeTip Founder here. 
**Update: I've posted an announcement about a new privacy policy**
I'm committed to addressing everyone's concerns. Some facts on ChangeTip:
1. **No one's data is being sold**. Furthermore, we promise that you are in control over what happens with your data, now and in the future. 
2. ChangeTip only has access to data that you explicitly grant. We don't ask for extra information from the sites we work with, only the bare minimum that we need to ask for so that we can verify it is your tip and you can collect it. For reddit in specific, **we don't have any information that isn't already publicly available**.
3. A privacy policy isn't a business plan, and there is a lot of inferring going on here with what *might* happen based on the way it is worded. You guys have a right challenge this, given the bad stuff that happens online with people's data. I understand that the privacy policy is currently too loose, and doesn't do a good job of providing folks with the comfort that they need to know that their data is safe. We will be taking a close look at it based on the feedback here, and making improvements as necessary so that folks feel comfortable. I'll respond back with an update to this thread, and will invite commentary.
A note about me and ChangeTip's values - I'm actually known for being **a good guy in the privacy war**. I have:
* Built a pixel blocking technology that prevents advertisers from gathering data from users 
* Built a product that monitors ads for site owners so they can know who the "Bad actors" are - the ones selling data without the users or the sites permission
* Built a Firefox plugin that allows for users to see where pixels are being dropped (kinda like Ghostery)
* Participated in Privacy Hackathons and worked with Privacy Experts in the industry to promote transparency, control, and choice for end users so they know where their data is going online.
So really - I'm on your side. I aim to promote transparency and control of your data. The privacy policy doesn't do a good job right now of showing that, and I accept responsibility for that. We'll get it fixed.

Peter Todd is the quintessential contrarian. He identifies situations where others are gleeful, and looks for a way to pop the balloon. It's how he boosts his ego, by trying to make others look bad.

Hey thanks for the kind words! 3 hugs We like the guys over at QuickCoin, they do a lot of good for the community. They run the Bitcoin Fair, and are pretty cool people.
Tipping on Facebook is hard. Their rules about what you can do under what circumstances with regards to privacy are very challenging to navigate when building an app, which is probably why QuickCoin took the Group approach. 
Our tipping experience on Facebook will be different. After we get the kinks worked out, we still have to get it approved through the Facebook App approval process, which will be even more fun. This is why we've been reluctant to announce timing on Facebook tipping with ChangeTip - there are a lot of issues to work through and a few things outside our control.
But we want Facebook tipping even more than you do, so it keeps us awake at night!

No business plans are affected - because we were never planning to sell user data. This is just an update to the privacy policy and terms. 
Since there is high accountability for mistakes on the privacy policy -  we are taking extra time to be careful, thoughtful, and rigorous. 
We also need to roll it out carefully so that users are alerted that the policy has been updated. It will happen this week, hopefully within a couple of days.

Ok then!
I was getting 504 HTTP errors repeatedly. It started about 36 hours ago. My first attempt to fix was to retry the transaction up to 3 times when this happened. That seemed to help, but not for long.
Then I noticed that it was only happening in production - when I did tests outside of AWS (where are servers are), never got a 504. Theory: Reddit is limiting traffic from AWS IPs (or routing it differently).
I reached out to the guys who run the dogetip bot to see if they had problems, he said No, but also said he had problems in AWS, so they run out of Linode. 
I am now proxying traffic outside of AWS (as of 3 hours ago) and haven't seen a single 504 since.

ChangeTip founder here. 
We're making a big bet that we can change human behavior. My theory is that people want to to be generous to strangers online - it feels good. We just aren't right now because it's too hard. 
Tipping is a great use case for Bitcoin because of:
1. **Low transaction fees**. Or in the case of ChangeTip - they are free because our tips are off chain. 
2. **Anonymity** - I don't have to know any of your personal details to send you money.
3. **Currency neutralizer** - I don't have to know if you are USD/EUR/JPY  to send you money.
Have a lunch on me @_date: 2014-03-13 07:11:34

That's all you'll accomplish with this legislation. In reality, even if this legislation passes, it will be impossible to enforce due to jurisdiction. New York is not the center of the world, and Bitcoin is a world wide effort. **Your laws do not apply to Bitcoin**.

Regarding Do Not Track - this standard is meant for **3rd party** sites that track users when they go to other sites. Not first party cookies on thesite.com. 
Fully implementing Do Not Track on first party cookies would effectively mean incognito mode for every visit to the site, which would mean it is impossible to do things like remember logged in state, user preferences, etc. Users would have to start over each time they came to the site. 
As a result, very few first party sites support Do Not Track for their main domain. Including reddit.com btw - if they did you would have to relogin every time you visited the site. [This article]( provides more information, including the reference that only 4 of the top 482 sites support DNT (although it's a bit dated).
The only information we "track" with our first party cookie is your session information, which contains only your changetip.com session data, that is necessary for using the site.

Aww man. That hurts my feelings. I've worked tirelessly on ChangeTip for the past 6 months, giving up just about everything else in my life to help drive the mass consumer adoption of Bitcoin.
It sounds like you just want it to be free, and/or maybe you are just mad because [we moved your cheese](

ChangeTip Founder here. 
Sean outlines how the fees are better below. As for connecting an account, yep, that has to happen because it's designed to work across multiple sites, not just Reddit. It also allows you to manage your wallet and see your tips with a web interface instead of messaging a bot with commands. Some folks think that is better.
You're welcome to continue using bot if you think that's better. Here's 1 coffee on me because I value all feedback. Cheers.

Yes, the internal ledger means that tips are free and instant. It also allows for warm/cold storage of the funds for security. 
When you deposit, that's a bitcoin transaction (into your ChangeTip wallet). Any tipping activity between accounts happens with the Internal ledger. When you withdraw, that's also a bitcoin transaction.

One of the aims with ChangeTip is to have a better user experience with Bitcoin.
It will be interesting to get the stats on the tip collection rates. I could argue that the user experience on the bitcointip bot is confusing (I know it was for me), and some people don't know how to send commands to a bot to collect their tip. I think your tip collect rate will go up with ChangeTip. And if not, we have a team of people focused on figuring out why. ;)

ChangeTip founder here. 
ChangeTip is heavily inspired by and the great work that they've done. the author, is an advisor of ours and [he gives ChangeTip his blessing](
We aim to lift the spirit of generosity and giving online, as well as fundamentally change the way content is produced and consumed. We call it a Love Button for the Internet. Imagine:
* You could tip someone on Quora for giving a high quality, thoughtful answer.
* When someone produces an inspiring video on youtube, you could donate to them by leaving a comment
* When raising money on Facebook for causes, you could just leave a Facebook comment to give $5
* You could support your favorite artists on SoundCloud by giving them $5
* Instead of a blogger making $4 a month on Google AdSense, users could tip them to see the site without ads for 30 days - with 1 click
The real value exchange with content online is between the people producing the content, and the people consuming the content. Let’s create a direct connection - instead of having advertising as the model. Once people see how easy it is to send money to strangers online, we will find a whole new marketplace is being created. Market dynamics say that the overall quality of the content should increase as well.
That’s a taste of what we are up to. We'd love to hear your thoughts! Good feedback will likely receive a tip!
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:55:11
cool! 
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:52:10


Aha. ChangeTip wasn't built for you. We're about making it easy to tip across the whole Internet, not just reddit! We don't aim to please everyone, because, well, we can't. :)  I don't see how to give you what you are asking for (a reddit only experience) without compromising the product experience for the other 99.999% of users that we aim to please.
Have you tried or any of the [other alternatives]( They might suit your workflow better. 
This is normally where I'd tip you for the dialog, but I'm guessing you won't accept. If you try the others and still want to come back, I'll be glad to give you a tip to get started!

**What Bitcoin needs to be successful is mass consumer adoption**. Tipping is going to change the way the Internet works, and the way content is produced and consumed. Digital Currencies are perfect for this because of [pseudo]anonymity and low transaction fees.

I was pretty excited when I saw that someone from blockchain was responding directly. Oh good, I thought, here's a chance for him to set things straight. 
In a public forum, he will acknowledge that security issues are of top concern, thank the contributor for reporting the issue, apologize for the botched handling of the reports, and set our minds at ease that everything is taken care of. 
Then, you failed. Hard. It doesn't matter if the OP is an ass. We don't give a shit about your guys' drama. *Check your ego and service your customers.*
I have several accounts with blockchain.info for me and my kids wallets. Considering how this interaction was handled, I no longer feel safe.
Do you want to try that again?
@_date: 2013-10-13 15:11:59
Well, protecting yourself against equipment failure is reasonable. Your language of "if I select to terminate the contract" made no mention of that, and left me, as a potential buyer thinking that the moment the deal was no longer in your favor, you'd turn it off, thus eliminating any potential upside I'd have. 
Maybe you'll find someone who reads it differently - but I certainly would not buy based on the way you've described it.
Edit: After thinking more, YES, I would expect that if I pay for this service, and equipment fails, you put another one in. If I rent a car, and it breaks down, I call the car rental place and they give me a new one. If you are renting/leasing equipment, it's your responsibility to keep it running. So I see no good reason for you to have a cancellation policy that you are in control of.
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:05:41
Since the conversation seems productive, and we are talking about mis-matched assumptions here, I will continue to share mine. Please correct me and we can walk through this process together. :)
Assumption  that I'm making - You think a 50 GH miner is going to make less than the opening price of the auction this year, otherwise you'd just run it yourself.
Fundamentally, our incentives are not aligned. Either you are making more money than me by charging me more for the lease than the miner produces ( you win ), OR , I am making more money than the price of the lease ( I win ). There isn't a win-win. 
The only way to have a win-win is that I accept the risk that I will make more money in the long run. Ie., I over pay in the first x months of the lease, but I'm betting that I will make up for it in the later months of the lease because A) the difficulty/hash rate goes down (laughable) or B) the price of bitcoin goes up (very believable).
So the only way this works is if there is a binding contract that guarantees me that if the price of bitcoin goes above the point where it is making me more money than you could make if you ran it yourself.
You are trading up front liquidity and I am speculating. But I need a guarantee that if I am right, I will indeed get paid, instead of having you just cancel the contract and run the miner yourself.

So the way I read this, as a buyer, is that "You can have this thing as long as it isn't cash flow positive for the me, the seller. I, the seller, can decide when I want it back, when I start making more money than leasing it to you, (because the price of bitcoins goes up, or the difficulty goes down), and cancel the contract."
With the ability to cancel the contract, I see no reason this is ever cash flow positive for the buyer.

1) Storage redundancy. I don't trust any single computer. I don't want to have to think about backups. I think my laptop/computer can die at any time. In my line of work (computer programmer, systems architect), I've learned to trust The Clouds for redundancy more than my own computer.
2) Password recoverability. This is especially important, as I mention above, with my kids. I have given them small amounts of bitcoin, and allowed them to take portions of their allowance as bitcoin. I don't trust them to remember a passphrase, much less keep a .wallet file safe/protected/backed-up.
3) Device Accessibility. Anywhere in the world, any time, with any internet-capable device, I can get to my wallet. I don't want to have to be at my computer where my .wallet file is to get to my money.
In the end, it's all about risk mitigation for me. I think it's much more likely that I lose my passphrase or .wallet file than a service like blockchain.info gets hacked (although I recognize the irony of bringing that up in a post about security compromises at said site, which is why I'm on the lookout for a truly secure online wallet)

Nope. The corresponding address is a different representation of the public key.
See the readme here:
Note the private key is a 64 character string. The public key is a ~130 character string. The address is the familiar bitcoin address (a 27-34 character string that starts with a 1 or a 3)
