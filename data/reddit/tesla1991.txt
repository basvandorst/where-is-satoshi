Now that we know he's alive, I like to think that he's lurking, preparing for the second coming (now third I guess)

My condolences.

"Communicated with bitcoins" lol it's either not him or he deserves an Emmy for that performance. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:05:50
He has always used "I"... Nothing new there. Also, we don't **know** anything of the sort. For all we know, that's a hacked account. I personally think that's not the case, but I don't **know** that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:13:03
he would do this if he's preparing to allow users to withdrawal their bitcoin. that is what this code is actually used for. More precisely, its part of the code that the Gox hot wallet uses to manage its holdings, and it is how they prepare bitcoin for outgoing transactions. 
the only reason that someone else would do this (that I can think of, hence my question) is to give us false hope that Gox is going allow withdrawals. 
edit: added the last bit

Can anyone find good data to the amount of bitcoin that has been donated??
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:39:04
You're correct about the security of many vs few wallets to some extent, because it's safer from the standpoint that some wallets could be lost or corrupted so if you spread them out it's safer from that perspective. 
However, it really isn't about the difficulty of someone hacking them, because even one wallet is extremely difficult to hack that this doesn't matter. It would take more computational power than the entire world has to hack a wallet in any persons lifetime (actually much, much longer). 
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:05:26
yeahhh... but it also gives them less options, gets them in and out faster (making them less likely to complain about wait times) and allows the company to focus on the one or two things they make, and make them really, really well and consistently, so that customers can get the same thing no matter what store in the chain they visit.

Awe poor OP went and downvoted everyone who responded negatively. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:25:38
Hella yessss

The true nakamoto would probably like it if someone else was outed because he's that much better than us. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:16:01
Or maybe he is just a very careful and academic writer, and chose a UK newspaper to help shield is identity and location. I also find myself coding later at night and not usually in the afternoon, but that's just me. 
I also live on the east coast and can tell you that everyone in academia here uses the Oxford comma pretty much all of the time. Also, everyone uses the possessive apostrophe... I'm not sure I get what you're saying here either... Because he clearly cares about bitcoin. It wasn't just a weekend hobby to him. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:57:59
I don't think that's overlooked... I think that's the whole point of bitcoin. 
IMHO the most overlooked/misunderstood aspect of bitcoin by the public is the way that trust is addressed. Unlike all previous payment systems, bitcoin doesn't require you to trust any third parties to protect your assets or personal information. You just have to trust that 51% of the computational power is doing what it's supposed to.

I saw $7.38 twice now but who knows. Probably just made up
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:42:19
A very valid point. However, could you explain to me why someone else would do this? Why would the Feds do this is they confiscated them and/or why would someone else who stole them do this? I'm not trolling, I'm genuinely curious about a reason someone else would take the time to do this
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:08:41
no, but you have to trust the bank when you hand it over to them, or when you use a bank to do an electronic transfer. I can hold or transfer bitcoin on my own without any financial institution or third party. 
edit: a word
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:13:54
OP gives away all of his credibility with that one. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:56:41
He's probably satoshi

This is the best damn part.... The worst is that I no longer have a good response ready for the question "who would you most want to meet?" For my job interview... 
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:22:16
Is this a fucking joke
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:15:30
No way a group of people can together decide not to spend 500 million dollars and keep that kind of secret.

When people say "bitcoin is like the internet" they are not usually talking about the currency. They are usually talking about the bitcoin **protocol**. 
When the internet started out people had no idea what it would eventually morph into. Similarly, today the bitcoin protocol is changing the way people view and consider trust, and the way in which they send and receive information. We, like the early adaptors of the internet, have no idea how this protocol will impact the future. That is why bitcoin is like the internet.

Because the number of blocks doesn't increase just because the number of transactions does.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:30:07
I'm still not convinced that he's doing it just because he's an idiot. I mean have you ever heard this guy speak on tv? its laughable. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:23:48
I can tell why this guy went into print media and not tv.

You're like the 50th person to post this. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:01:34
Someone call Leah, she'll want to see this.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:40:30
There's somewhat related to research based on food options. Chipotle and 5 guys, among others, have showed that by telling customers what they are going to buy (basically just burritos/bowls at chipotle and just hamburgers at 5 guys) improves customer experience and profitability. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:46:34
Haha you cannot make this stuff up

Bitcoin isn't about making money. Bitcoin, the protocol, is about a method to achieve peer to peer transfer of funds that does not rely on financial institutions, and does not require you to trust a 3rd party to hold your assets.
Bitcoin is revolutionary because of it's utility, not because it can make people money. It has made some people a lot of money. But that is not the goal. 
Your post is along the same lines  as saying that you think email is stupid because it doesn't make you money. That's the not the point of email... Even though some people have made a lot of money off of email services. 
Also, prepare to be downvoted to hell. Next time do your research... Maybe read the white paper.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:19:19
Hopefully this guy makes some money off this after it's all said and done... It must suck to have 50 reporters outside your house when you have no idea what they're talking about.
