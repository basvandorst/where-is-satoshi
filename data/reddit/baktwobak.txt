Keep in mind that blockchain.info doesn't allow you to close your wallet account. Which is of course great for their wallet stats but not so great for those who like to keep their digital footprint under control.

Unlike the movies, there is nothing romantic about getting financially wiped out.

2009, Mainstream economists dismiss bitcoin because:
1. It's a bubble
2. Regulators will step in.
2017, Mainstream bitcoiners dismiss Ethereum because:
1. It's a bubble
2. Regulators will step in.

Bitcoin is resilient no doubt about that. Ethereum, on the other hand, has survived at least 2 major incidents.
1. TheDao fiasco that even led to a contentious hard fork.
2. The ongoing hacker attacks which led to a spree of hard forks and a consensus failure between two different protocol implementations (clients).
While bitcoin corrections were always market driven, Ethereum ones have been mostly tech related and have proven that Ethereum is resilient where it counts ie tons of faith in its tech and the dev community.

I wouldn't trust a guy who calls himself a trader and yet has failed to predict Ethereum's market dominance.
That's like calling yourself a football manager while failing to foresee the rise of the likes of Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
