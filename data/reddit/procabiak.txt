Well neither of those will happen this year or next.
Bitcoin doesn't need Visa level. The visa scale quoted figure of 2000 transactions per second is massively inaccurate because of geopolitical realities (compliance/SOX). Visa likely runs one set of mainframe computer per country, then collated daily for stats. The 2000 figure comes from annual worldwide total transactions (62Bn) from Visa + Mastercard divided by 365/24/60/60. If we divide this by population or by country to find a more accurate figure, we'll land at about 100-200 transactions per second per country (US taking the largest shares, Europe/Oceania taking the lower share)
Add in amex and the figure might be slightly higher, but in general it is a more realistic target. Let's guestimate 250 transactions per second. Well then we aren't far off by increasing the block size to about 90mb to support visa/mc/amex level on a per country basis. I forgot China Union Pay.
The reality is Bitcoin the tech only needs to be powerful enough, not the powerful. Altcoins have a purpose and no it isn't to spin off Bitcoin to create Litecoin and Dogecoin, it is also part of the formula for decentralisation and scalability. One country, one currency. Bitcoin only needs to be powerful enough to scale to a small country for it to become a reserve currency for the world. The dream that Bitcoin alone should support the entire world needs to be left behind us. Maybe in the next 20-40 years that could happen, but for the next 10 years, no. Not without the help of another layer like Lightning, which IMO only works great for subscription channels and not for payment. (Subs make up a tonne of our transactions - utilities, services, local council taxes, which all benefit from automation via Lightning and reducing clutter on the main network).

@_date: 2015-06-10 23:07:51
I gave a ratio, though. If the number of nodes is 3, then yes, one corruption kills it all. I assume that if nodes are that easy to corrupt, we're screwed anyway. I suppose you need a minimum, so maybe 10 nodes and 5 bad actor nodes. Then you need to corrupt 3 honest nodes to be at an advantage. The idea is as long as the majority are honest, we'll be fine.
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:47:36
You've lost me. 10 satoshi can be split into ten 1's. Fractioning of the total supply means there is a hard limit somewhere. You can assign 'this 1 can only buy oranges', 'this 1 can only buy apples' using colored coin, but you can only assign 21 quadrillion times before you run out. How do you solve being able to assign more than that limit? That is the question we ask when we talk about divisibility.
A token based economy is going to end up like barter. Which isn't workable. There's a reason why value is in the unit. The majority of the market is going to see the numbers in bitcoin the same as dollars. A minority will see value in the pattern, such as colored coins used for company shares.

@_date: 2015-12-08 02:27:32
My understanding is: Basically because signature data is stripped out, the 1mb blocks can fill up a lot more segwit transactions. The block is still 1mb limit.
However the full nodes still need to validate the signatures. That amounts to the other 3mb+ of signatures that they need to download.
Effectively, this means txns estimated 4mb of bandwidth is required for a 1mb block.
4mb is worse case scenario. It will likely fluctuate depending how many sigs are needed.
Edit: its a soft fork because it doesn't toy with the 1mb limit. It just works within it
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:34:23
The miners won't vote beyond 8mb, especially since China holds the majority of hashing power who are the ones asking for 8. If somehow we do hit 32, the max block limit can be raised (edit: raised again by doing this exercise again. But it will be much easier)
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:27:09
The change to 20 or 8 mb involves applying a type of fork that *can* split Bitcoin in two. I don't know what you are referring to when you say the opposite.
BIP100 is the safer route. This hard fork is backwards compatible up to the first vote is successful (which means all / most of the miners would have upgraded their software by then).
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:25:21
The divisibility of bitcoin I'd say is Satoshi's greatest deception (a magician's deception I mean). Likely not intentional, just an outcome that came out of his desire to create a currency, but we never know.
A bitcoin unit is represented by an integer. Which is sort of like how 1 dollar is usually stored as 100 cents in databases. But that familiarity of using decimals is only because of the metric system. The unit of bitcoin is more like the cents or like the Yen, a whole number represents the smallest piece.
To divide that integer would mean changing it to a floating point (or preferably, a double). Floats and doubles have a precision limit where decimal numbers will start to become inaccurate after very long decimal places. This is dangerous for Bitcoin because it could corrupt validation some day, not to mention other wallet dependencies assume and rely on the value being an integer.
The other way to achieve the same feat is to reindex and multiply everyone's existing units by 10, therefore the % of distribution doesn't change, but the number of 0s have, effectively introducing a decimal point. But the total supply would feel inflated. Again this will break all wallets as they will represent the new-satoshi the wrong way.
In a way, division = inflation. Just that the inflation is given back to those with an existing stake rather than assigned to a central bank type entity.
We should discard any notion of being able to 'add' decimal points on demand, due to technical reasons just explained. The change would likely involve discussions as granular as the max block size debate today if not more.

I see. But they're all controversial and we really don't know what the split % is. 8mb iirc still isn't on Mike Hearn's radar, he has set his mind on 20mb and I don't see him coming to a compromise.
Secondly his push for XT worries me. If he wants to roll out this change and be serious about it, he shouldn't hook in his Lighthouse specific changes to it.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:37:06
It's not just latency. You might be able to run a hub over Tor, but other hubs don't want to trust your dodgy dark hub, so no one will be able to send your users any payments via the hub. LN is basically a web of trust from what I gather, a corruption of what Bitcoin is: trustless.
Maybe that is OK as long as we can still rely on the main chain for trustless transactions. But we don't know if that will remain the case at all after LN is built. The markets could react unpredictably. For example start imposing heavier fees on non-LN txns, delaying non-LN txns and prioritising LN txns, or dropping non-LN txns altogether.

This hard fork jgarzik is proposing will be safer because of the voting process. A certain percentage (95%?) have to agree before the first increase is applied, where they should already have the upgraded software in time to do said voting.
If there is no consensus on this hard fork then that first increase will never happen, we are back to square one and then we need to find a new solution.
Tldr this is a dramaless solution to a dramatic problem.

I think the point of faster blocks isn't security. If e.g. we half it to 5 minutes, then confidence against double spending will just double to 12 blocks, I.e. 1 hour to confirm.
Faster blocks clear out backlog faster, but increases orphan rate. For miners it is pretty clear they do not like orphaning blocks. So I doubt this will be considered without incentives to do so.
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:06:57
It's a lot cheaper to buy or rent existing mining pools or farms via a contract.
Mining farms these days are companies. I think of them being the same, or will eventually be the same, as free services companies who sell based on your personal data. Instead of personal data, they offer rights to their hashing to other large companies (not like cloud hashing schemes, which are smaller in scale and mostly scams) or rent them. There's a lot to buy to get 51% though, but it would be less than that of buying mining equipment. You just need to corrupt honest miners one by one with juicy looking contracts that helps pay their bills.

Old open source development paradigms for consensus do NOT work well with Bitcoin. A hard fork is dangerous because each hard fork is basically an attack to the existing network.
There is no consensus via voting with forks, only those who follow and those who are left behind. But that is for a binary fork. What happens when we face a three pronged fork where each has ups and downs? Or five forks at the same time? That's the kind of crap that open source does to software. You cannot have that with Bitcoin, otherwise it breaks the intended functionality and design of a consensus chain.
One hard fork at a time only.
Consensus can only be achieved via a vote, IMHO, otherwise voices are unheard. An unanimous or high majority vote for the same change, using a consensus voting system. We have one, it is called the blockchain, and all the tools are pretty much in place, all you need is OP_RETURN and a hash. We can even vote now and write a parser later to raise the block size based on our vote.

DNA Address maybe? You get everyone who wants to vote to submit a phantom coin transfer (a coin not on the blockchain yet) from their DNA Address and forward that to your candidate. Set miners to validate for unique addresses are only sending 1 phantom coin. I say use a phantom coin because it would be stupid to ask everyone to vote to also mine and compete to vote... And a 0 difficulty mine could just bulk up the chain very fast.
DNA can probably tell us (and could probably be validated by miners) it's a human voter. DNA on its own not tied to an identity is meaningless. But it will have to be some kind of global vote, and not national, as national voting won't work if people buy votes from offshore.
Then the govt doesn't need to keep track of identities to addresses and can't make votes out of thin air sans making a lot of babies.
Maybe DNA can be spoofed but I'm no DNA expert so maybe this might not work well, maybe it will.

Spending it isn't going to help. You, the hodler, feel bitcoin is a valuable asset. The standard coinbase/bitpay merchant on the other hand currently do NOT treat it as a valuable asset, and sell it off immediately.
To them, they don't care the sale will tank the price and trigger off chain reactions or break through support walls. They got their fiat so they're happy. Auto rebuy doesn't undo any of the chain reactions that has already taken place.
The only way to keep the price constant is to transact with other like minded folk (those that do treat it valuable and hold/pay suppliers in pure btc), and keep our own economy self sustaining. None of this auto sell and auto rebuy will help the price remain constant/grow. In fact all this auto sell and auto buy is simply additional overhead that is costing the Bitcoin economy in fees by passing them onto the buyer.

A separate page would be nice but only if you intend to continue to use auto exchange services like coinbase. 
With Bitcoin, in its bare form, a donation can really be as simple as displaying the address on the page. Its a 32 character string, not any bigger than your donation banner.
You can implement your coinbase interface in the back end and forward funds to it for exchange.

Helping transactions propagate faster is what I'm focused on. More local nodes = faster propagation. If I have to directly connect to the west coast from Oceania every time I send a transaction or download a block it could take longer than usual.
The difference might only be a few seconds, but for a miner those seconds is the difference between wasting time on a completed block or starting the next one. And for a merchant it's the difference between "thank you" and "pay up".

Because the network is not centralized. In a decentralized system you can broadcast a txn to many directions at the exact same time. For simplicity let's say 2, north and south. Please bear in mind the explanation below is a simplistic take on the concept:
If the two txns that were communicated to north and south were txns sending to two different recipients, then the fastest one to propagate wins, and the other is considered a double spend.
Now assuming the travel speed is the same for both, there is a 50/50 split (approx) on who's transaction is right. Half the network has agreed on something the other half didn't.
In order to remedy whose transactions are correct, the proof of work is required to bundle one of the two txns. If you solve a block, you get to put your version of that txn. So who is able to solve a block matters, because they are in control of the bundling process.
So we don't want one miner to have all that control - that would be effectively a centralized system. So miners are forced to compete to find blocks that meet a certain criteria.
Edit: the criteria of the proof of work is solving a block that has a certain number of 0's in front of a hashed block.
Hope this helps.

Err... input private key? (Assuming you mean importing a paper wallet) Why would you input a private key manually? You can use QR code. Blind people are capable of using cameras and point it to their paper at random and hear a BEEP for success.
They would only need to communicate via NFC using a phone wallet to download payment information. Then tap send (or via voice command). Rarely will they need to use a keypad to enter a number, even in that case they can use bluetooth keypads.
You don't necessarily need PIN to unlock a wallet. There is the android drag-lock thing which is pattern-based (which a blind person can do easily by feeling the edges of the phone &amp; work out the position needed to swipe).
There's plenty of technology today to help blind people use smart phones. It's not an issue - the issue is to get a dev who has the time to develop these into a full-feature wallet for them. I imagine it's not being done right now because there's no market for it yet, but you probably will see this in the future.

This is a human problem, not a bitcoin problem. If they can't even keep a password on paper, they should stop using the internet.
Try get them to use a password manager like keypass.
Also, try a wallet recovery service. There's a guy on this sub who will try to brute force your wallet. He charges a 20% fee. You must give him the wallet (blockchain.info sends you backups by email) + some clues to what the password might be. If it is something stupid like abcd1234 he'll crack it in no time.

Few days late but - great write up. If there is anything I disagree with, or rather think there isn't much weight to that point &amp; could be elaborated further, it's the part where you noted Bitcoin cannot yet be classified as money until it gains "general acceptance" according to Austrian economics. Let's work with that assumption for now.
At what point can we measure and finally flip the switch to say, "this is now a currency"? Most unfortunately, we do not have the right tools to measure "general acceptance" of Bitcoin accurately. This can be partially measured by IP address+User agent, or number of wallets, or number of merchants, but we need a census collected - a nigh impossible task in a decentralised environment (the Internet) to get accurately, but maybe one day we can get it. Though, to answer this quickly based on numbers alone, I went ahead to wikipedia for answers. Going by the list of [least populated countries]( the first country not using the euro I can see is Brunei. The first country not fixed to another currency's value and not using the euro is Iceland. These countries harbor only a population of &lt; 500,000 people. (If I have to estimate the number of merchants in the country, it'd be 50,000?). On numbers alone, I think it's safe to assume Bitcoin has &gt; 500,000 users &amp; 30,000 merchants, based on Coinbase stats alone. Just enough to be able to call Bitcoin money, maybe?
Not saying Bitcoin fits that perfect definition of 'generally accepted' money yet. Bitcoin does currently underperform as a system of usable money though due to the geographical isolation of its users and its merchants. You can't for example go to any restaurant and pay with Bitcoin yet. So, how large a regionally clustered group of users and merchants using Bitcoin is required for it to become money? It becomes silly to answer because of the nature of Bitcoin living on the Internet, and the emergence of the shipping industry, makes it perfectly capable of working as money. Just not with restaurants yet because you can't ship most cooked meals over long distance. :D
The Bitcoin economy is also currently lacking certain types of goods not being offered which weakens its position on the merchant side; food and groceries (&amp; other consumption goods/hospitality) for example is lacking, while goods such as computers or phones are plentiful (thanks to NewEgg/Tiger Direct/Dell &amp; and many other techy businesses). How or which category of goods are required for Bitcoin to be classified as money? Well, this one is easy; you fulfil needs before wants (apply: Maslow's hierarchy of needs as applied to goods &amp; services). But Bitcoin is all over the place in terms of what needs are being fulfilled, or is being filled from top down. So it is not money?
I think it is. Bitcoin is probably what can be currently classified a luxurious form of money if we are to go by our current merchant adoption. While the Bitcoin economy can't satisfy all your needs, it can buy you a load of crap you don't need. It can eventually become general purpose money at a later stage. But Bitcoin can't just 'switch on' and be money one day once it satisfies the definition of money though - it either is now, or it isn't. Or perhaps money is simply subjective to an individual person and not up to us economists to decide, and we're preaching to a brick wall.

Txn fees are not that bad.
At today's 7 txns per second, if each txn had the default fee of 0.0001 x 7 x 60 x 10 = 0.42btc per conf ($180 per conf). But 7 txns per second doesn't scale to VISA size. If it does, that would be 0.0001 x 1000 x 60 x 10 = 60 btc per conf. That is a really big reward at today's rate ($24000 per conf). That is excluding block reward.
Likely, if the network reaches VISA scale, the price of bitcoin would have to scale too, and the fee would be readjusted to be equivalent to 1 cent (let's assume that will be 1 ubtc/bit, so $10K per bitcoin). 0.000001 x 1000 x 60 x 10 = 0.6 btc per conf ($6k per conf).
$6k isn't bad considering people get $10k today at 25 btc x $400. Although transaction volume will be variable so you won't always hit 1000 txns a second, on a poor 10 min block you might only get 100 txns a second. Maybe we will see variable hash rates during peak and off peak business hours as miners time their efforts (the 2 week difficulty adjustment would have to be reduced though - which should be fair if there are no more block rewards).

Not to discredit your theory, I think that's a possibility. The arguments from the other side though, come from trying to understand who Satoshi is and what was his endgame.
He knew what was being created (an eCash that finally works - this is 30 years of academic research that he breezed through in 2 years from 2007 to 2009). He is likely an academic in CompSci, where coding skills go to rot without practice (everyone says his code was old school), but he knows enough cryptography and understands the works of the cypherpunks brilliantly to be able to incorporate them (or its concepts) into bitcoin.
No matter how worthless these bitcoin were, he would probably only lose a few of them, not his entire million, based on his above profile. It is like asking a master cryptographer if he loses every single key to their encrypted data. Not likely.
I'm sure he clearly knew these would be worth a lot, but not so rapidly (IMO his agenda on Wikileaks was very transparent from those 2 sentences he wrote, either politically or market driven). I suspect he was hoping it would see slow growth. But the market didn't work his way.
He can't spend his reserve because he knows it will crash the market if he starts. I suspect he is likely holding out his 1m of reserve once the ecosystem no longer relies on exchanges. That way they can be spent without harming the ecosystem. How he spends it we won't know.

I'm from Australia, Melbourne. We use it fairly regularly, but I thought we got this term from the USA... Anyway shouting doesn't just mean paying - it means 'buying a friend x', usually a consumable good like drinks or dinner, just because a friend is being a friend... Shouting someone is only used amongst friends/family and typically not random strangers (unless you got deep pockets, but there's a different term for that).
The idea I want to use here is to not treat the bitcoin you give as a repayment for the goods received (I mean you can but that's very calculative of you :D), but as an IOU ledger to return the favor later, so that you can remember who to treat (say, if you have a forgetful memory, but I don't, and I want to use this as an experiment to increase bitcoin adoption).
Behind the scenes, you ARE giving them money. So when you return the favor &amp; ask for those bitcoins back, there is no economic loss (sans exchange loss/gains and probably the price of the drink/dinner) between your friends - you paid for a friend's food and received bitcoin in return. Next time he/she shouts you again you give 'em some coins again.
And they can't cheat you by topping up the wallets for more 'favors' that you don't remember - because they're giving you, well, real money. In reality it's a shout that never happened.
If they spend it elsewhere, we've won.

Learned about it when wikileaks got donated btc after  hearing about the visa/MasterCard problem. It felt like a revolution was starting. Wanted to do something btc related. Ended up playing games.
Came back to the scene just a week or two before the April 2013 crash. Wanted to start buying (on Mt gox...), saw roadblocks, couldn't be fucked so I started mining at 50btc for a bit (0.15btc). Then withdrew and gave up for more gaming
Came back just 2 weeks during the Nov rush. Found out about coinjar (I live in aus). Started buying a small bit at the ATH... And a bit more at the china dip. And a bit more after that. Started mining again (on multipools). Not sure when I'll stop mining yet now that scrypt asics are entering the market.
But damn that gaming addiction! Could've been rich :(

Agree. When all the speculative nature of it is gone, I reckon probably by 2020 when 90% of coins are mined, and also presuming everyone is using it, we'll see "real" stability.
Based on economic fundamentals of supply and demand, the price should always rise. Slow continuous rises will be a measurement of real stability, unmoving price (i.e. what people define as stability) will be an indicator of low economic activity and drop in price will be an indicator of failure/direct lost of trust.

Yep. Now look at it this way: B can receive txn1 and deny txn2 as a double spend. C can receive txn2 and deny txn1 as a double spend. How do you solve that?
B and C can't just talk to each other and solve it out, because one would be wrong and somehow they need to decide which. There are the other 7000 nodes needed to reach consensus too.
If there was a majority, it is easy to reach consensus. But often there isn't because there are those 50/50 splits.

Yes, 1 million bits make up a bitcoin. so 1 bit is about 0.3 cents right now.
If you've been overseas in places like Thailand/Vietnam many people are accustomed to using high numbers for low value items (10000 for lunch), and that's partially where the drive to use bits come from, and also because people don't like seeing 0.00003.
Another common denomination is mBtc, or milli-bitcoins. 1000 mBtc makes up a bitcoin.

Bitcoin was the first. Everyone else copied, and changed a little thing that they didn't like (algorithms, total supply, supply rate, etc). Because bitcoin is the first, and most popular, it has a large network effect.

A split second is all the vulnerability a hacker needs though. Its probably better to do the transaction offline, then broadcast the signed txn. That way your privkey is never revealed.
Actually I've been reading address reuse is bad because of a potential mathematical weakness in ECDSA being able to recompute your private key based off past transactions. It is why HD wallets is being pushed for.
Also privacy.

Signing, in the encryption world (today's PKI &amp; PGP practices), is meant to be reusable. A signature proves you own a privkey, and priv keys are multi use. Only in the context of bitcoin are things getting muddy because it is about money, so multi use of a privkey is discouraged.
But you're right overall. I'm not an ECDSA expert, I'll let you explain all the technical issues behind ECDSA. :)
Also I didn't factor in the miners and 51% attacks that could pose a risk.
Indeed, it is an unlikely risk (very unlikely) because you'd need a strong solo miner with 40%-51% hashing power for that to be a likely event. There is no other way to reverse a txn, so even an ordinary hacker with no mining power/without connections with a miner friend can't do anything about it. 
If an evil miner is attacking, we'd have known, and bitcoin would be dead. A 51% attack is the only way you would be able to do this today, but the incentive to be a bad miner isn't present yet thanks to the huge block reward. Remember the security behind Bitcoin is merely just a really big brick wall - if it costs a hacker $2 for a ladder to steal $1, he's not gunna do it.
You fear the 51% attack as much as I do. When a fix to the 51% attack is thought up, the already unlikely problem we are discussing would be a non issue.
Protecting the privacy of the sender is only an issue today because of our reliance on exchanges and their KYC/AML paperwork. Address tracing will be fooled when bitcoin stops circulating into exchanges and solely into the hands of the bitcoin users and merchants and its employees' paychecks. It is a non issue. Coinbase and BitPay are the issues.
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:46:13
Not necessarily changing every transaction, just future transactions.
Unlike inflation of supply, divisibility is something people can get behind as they aren't going to lose the value of their bitcoins. I don't think there will be a discussion about pro or against divisibility... But maybe for which implementation is better.
For something like this, we won't realistically need it for 1000+ years, so instead of risking a fork now, you could probably implement it now, and make it only active after a certain block height 1000 years in the future. Plenty of time for people to upgrade. Plenty of time to re-implement (in case better techniques comes along).
I think it's something worth looking at after all the current enhancements are done/problems are solved. While it's hundreds or thousands of years before we need it, it future-proofs Bitcoin, something fiat doesn't do very well.
That's assuming Bitcoin survives its first 20 years of criticism though. :)

About software and media.... not a chance.
DRM can still get stripped off the software. Media can be 2nd-hand recorded without drop in quality. As a piracy prevention mechanism amongst regular consumers, it's still ineffective.
Bitcoin as DRM can be used in the corporate world, because they aren't able to use cracked software. It is no different from a smart contract which is probably a better term. However it's not enforceable with Bitcoin alone - what if someone loads the same private key against multiple computers? It will still involve human intervention i.e. license audits and lawyers, so it's a waste to implement it, really, any any old CD-key system is adequate for the task.

Haven't watched the vid... But the costs of a 51 attack is next to nothing if you can get enough people into mining through 1 pool.
Building up a hashfarm to 51 attack is nonsensical for Bitcoin. Once you succeed you gotta keep building more miners to keep up. Zero daying people's miner machines is a much easier option for an attacker.

Mining reward is always on the drop. That is not a cost to mine however. The cost is just the machine and electricity.
Large companies doing the mining will stop eventually as they don't have incentive to continue. I suspect each Halving will lose one big player at a time and will sell off their equipment to the 2nd hand consumer market.
If they sell to other big players wholesale then we get a little more centralization. But if the pattern continues then eventually it will be sold to consumers. Also I'm sure they're aware of the 51% attack so there is more incentive to sell to consumers instead to secure their holdings better.

If a wallet can track debt, people can just abandon the debt since you can download a new wallet.

I think we should just tip the owner of good original/entertaining content/well thought out posts, and *encourage* people to create good original/entertaining content and reward them for it. Avoid tipping reposts (wait an hour or two and you'll know people are posting reposts via thread comments).
Also think about tips for services. Said service could be just a guy linking the video you needed, or something you asked for.

I've been a critic of bitcoin -&gt; fiat remittances. It takes too long for the average person to set up an exchange on both end (or with rebittance, an exchange on one end and a rebittance account). While they'll save money, they'll be disinterested if it's not easy and frankly they *would* rather pay that 10% cost.
People don't need to know the inner workings of their fiat -&gt; fiat exchange. So this service is a big win if it takes off.

How are you going to prevent the scams that will happen against existing wallets, exchanges and other services that currently use 1 XBT = 1 BTC?
You should -never- redefine what the full unit is. People jumped the gun, chose a value you didn't like, and now you want to go back and correct it for the sake of political correctness and introduce potential damage.
Do whatever you want to conform with the ISO standard all you will, but be ready to face backlash if you cause anybody to lose money.

I think IBM is just over-engineering the idea.
Internet of things doesn't need anything from blockchain technology at all. It doesn't need incentive, it doesn't need a miner to validate anything, it doesn't need consensus, and it doesn't need value, it just needs to pop data into a data store and distribute it to other nodes, and have every interval ask "where are my users and what are they doing?"

The more people burning bitcoin the quicker we need to implement infinite divisibility...
@_date: 2014-10-02 09:05:45
That's not how it works. The merchant acts first, breaking buy-walls that trigger chain reactions in the exchanges when broken. You can't stabilise the price of bitcoin with 'buy backs'. You may take 2-3 days to decide to buy back, or 'bulk buy' back in a months time. This lag time is the general lack of demand that is one contribution to the price drop over time. Price drop leads to uncertainty, so you pause your re-purchase even further for the opportune price.
This is what everyone is doing right now.
If you want a stable price of bitcoins, you need everyone to *stop* hitting the exchange every time you conduct a transaction. The only way to do that is to either start supporting merchants that don't use coinbase &amp; bitpay conversion, or just use the damn credit card. Or hodl on.

I don't think it will blow up during the next halving. One miner may exit and sell the hardware to a competitor miner at discount, or sell the hardware to consumers. The end result is those miners get to profit on their exit while network difficulty remains just as high.
What will probably blow up mining is if transaction fees can't offset the next 8-12 year's halving. "Bitcoin will either be a success or a failure in 20 years".

That's the idea. The reward will invite the best of the best hackers and scholars in the computer science space.

@_date: 2014-09-16 12:20:55
I doubt it's the algorithm. It's a game of demand and supply (although imo it's a game of just supply, that's why we like Bitcoin right? :D). From a supplier's perspective:
I think the price is not exploding because there's no new players. When is warning people everyday that it is not profitable, why is it that the difficulty keeps rising and price keeps dropping?
If a tonne of new players started the mining game, mining will get extremely unprofitable for everyone, all the mining companies will slowly quit &amp; would rather buy btc to invest (if they're believers) which will increase the price. But this isn't happening and we're seeing the opposite.
I suspect most miners are not selling it all off to pay electricity (that's a small concern for the efficient - those who weren't, would already have dried up by now. Most of it would be kept). But they are probably using it to buy more miners to keep their % of the share of 3600btc/day constant. This explains the network difficulty's constant rise - it's not newcomers (they play a very small role). It's the same people at war.
If all the miners were selling off btc every day, the price would be dropping constantly. Miners have an incentive to not crash the price because then they don't have an exit plan to sell off their mining equipment if Bitcoin is dead. But they don't have a way to keep the exchange constant, because buying mining equipment using freshly minted btc, their merchant may be selling it off instead.
Once that constant starts to drop to a point where adding a new miner won't give the same % returned, maybe we'll see:
- a sell off of mining equipment to capitalise on exit profits (they'll be at discount against new mining equipment, which may rebalance the profitability of mining for individuals again)
- more price uncertainty (will there be increased demand to buy 2nd hand miners? if so -&gt; small price rallies. If not -&gt; price declines or is constant. Will there be any supply? who knows)
- a small initial decline in difficulty as equipment gets turned off and shipped around, but should remain constant long term
There will be a SHARP decline in mining profitability by the next halving, so you will start seeing exit strategies being executed at least a year to half a year beforehand. Vet Miners exit --&gt; increased incentive to mine as an individual again --&gt; price rises (buy btc to buy miners) --&gt; difficulty remains constant-just-profitable point, but will rise again --&gt; and profitability rebalances for the next halving, and the cycle continues.
My prediction is that each halving introduces price uncertainty that skews towards a price rally and then a slow decline till the next halving, which rallies the price again. A price decline could still happen if Vet Miners exit --&gt; not willing to sell miners at discount --&gt; difficulty drops --&gt; miners continue the buying miners cycle --&gt; only downward pressure on price.
tl;dr conspiracy to stop newcomers so they can keep their reward share constant until the next halving

If it is falling, don't worry, it's cyclical. 
The price drop alerts miners to quit, sell their miners at discount (or keep useless sha256(sha256(x)) machines, their call), and newcomers armed with cheap miners will try to profit. Cheap discount miners put pressure on new mining equipment companies to lower costs for a new one (A KnC miner doesn't cost $5k-10k to produce. These units cost $500 at best.)
Rinse. And. Repeat. The economic security model of Bitcoin is genius. I don't ever expect the difficulty to fall substantially. It will only keep going up.
It's a bit earlier than when I expected (expected to see this 6-12 months before the halving) but I suppose with the price falling like that anything can happen.
Expect a lot of cheap 2nd hand miners on eBay!
Don't know what it means for bitcoin price yet though. Could potentially bring stabilization... Who knows.

A bitcoin/cryptocurrency economy is efficient &amp; self sufficient. If there were no exchanges nor ATMs built around it, the cryptocurrency alone would be self sufficient to empower an economy. Fiat on the other hand is not self sufficient. It requires outside actors to print, store &amp; distribute it. Without these actors the control and safety of money is difficult. And there is a physical barrier to its use (continental/national). Efficiency is power, &amp; economies will embrace the efficient as its businesses strive to compete. It's not a matter of if, but when.

Keepass has several modes of authorizing access - Master password, key file, or using both.
The key file is insurance against keyloggers. The hacker would need to deploy more than just keylogging to get to you.
If you keep the key file on a USB stick that is almost like 2fa (until that file gets compromised). But using it makes portability a problem (you can't stick a USB into your phone for example). So there's some convenience sacrifice for security.
Last pass iirc stores your password db encrypted on their servers and decrypt locally in a browser environment. To me that spells additional disaster when there is a browser vulnerability or one on the last pass site. With keepass I can optionally keep it on an offline PC if I want to.
Tldr; last pass = web wallet, keepass = armory.

I have to read your sentence with a bit of sarcasm given your other replies to this thread.
You asked if anyone is working on this problem. They are, why does it matter they're small and only in 1 city? Bitcoin is not as big as you think it really is, and you now want all this support and infrastructure in a finger click to rival WU overnight. Not going to happen today, but it's actively growing. Give it 5 years and ask this question again and see where WU is at then. Use the remindme bot if it helps.
I've been waiting to hear about a service like this for many months. It's here now, and there's no doubt they're going to expand, given time. They obviously have a game plan if they're working on razor thin margins (either VC/sell or building in automation to reduce human  labour costs).

Cryptocurrency is an idea, implemented via technology. It's not really second generation if it still uses similar concepts but maybe I'm being picky with terms.
But I'd proceed with caution. I've skimmed through their whitepaper, one part they're proposing is alarming...
They control the USD/EUR part entirely. They're basically backing their virtual coin with cash. What stops them from closing business and run off with your cash? None. They virtually double your money (the cash goes in, the cashcoin goes out). You'll be left with a virtual asset that no one can redeem if they close doors.
The only entity that can do this without collapse is a central bank who CAN already issue fiat in printed form, and who has the interest of keeping the system afloat as their secondary cash system (maybe initially as a means to cut printing costs/save the environment drive, for example).
Any other entity doing so can't be trusted (yes there is some inherent irony about this statement - but it is true if the concern is about fiat backing)
Don't fall for the (potential) scam. Personally, I think that if they had good intentions, they could've implemented a node.js version of bitcoin core like what btcd is doing - we don't need more alt coins, but we need more alternative full node clients.
@_date: 2014-11-08 23:13:07
Point  is a good one. I feel like the broadcasting is done the wrong way - merchants should be broadcasting the txn after the customer has signed it, and not the customer. After all it is in the merchant's interest to secure the funds!
Merchant apps/POS terminals should have some built-in broadcaster and wallet apps should use that feature as a backup in case they have no internet connection.
But this makes it hard with QR code, and it makes it weird with NFC because you have to tap twice, but I'd rather have that than no transactions at all.

What the hackers are hacking for those big online services is not bitcoin itself, but the non bitcoin infrastructure, e.g. the web server, the data centres, etc. And using standard hacking techniques (SQL injection, or other 0-day exploits, dictionary/rainbow table attacks etc.). Once they are inside they can then steal bitcoins.
It is the same as them stealing credit card information. The difference is bitcoin private keys are no longer a point of failure since you can keep that all offline, whereas credit cards must stay online. But in the early days these startups weren't security aware and tools weren't readily available (e.g. no HD wallets).
Bitcoin itself hasn't been hacked yet. It has had bugs that disrupted the blockchain at one point though, which was promptly fixed.

Duh, you do realise every USA exchange or broker charge a price right? Of course it's not going to be free...
Financial freedom comes at a cost. 0.5% fees + 2% spread. It's a freedom you don't need today, but you will need it sometime in the future if you know what your gov't is doing.
The average consumer doesn't even care what their gov't is doing. This is the real challenge we need to face. How to get average Joe to care, and realise that money being printed at the same rate as tree leaves being grown is actually a problem and not a solution. In fact, they don't even know where money comes from.
I don't really give a damn about the average consumer. They still think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. If they still don't understand the problem, we shouldn't waste our time explaining it to them, the most we should do is build a page or video and link them to it.

Here's my thought. Assuming that bitcoin IS infinitely divisible (in the future), then it is the same as inflation but just counting backwards. 
Those who save are rewarded. The number gets bigger (i.e. worth more) without actually getting bigger (21m btc). It's a self governing bank akin to putting fiat in a bank and getting interest. Except that interest only serves to keep your money relevant in tomorrows economy rather than grow it, but I suspect once bitcoin's value stabilizes, then the rate of deflation will be relatively slow, to the pace of an interest rate.
Edit: pushed submit too early.
When peoples money are worth more they're likely to spend it. So money continues to flow back into the economy. Therefore it self governs the economy into one which eventually spends - the only argument against deflationary currencies is that fiat inflation forces people to spend.
This theory of mine of course relies on infinite divisibility. Which, in computing terms, is theoretically possible (at the cost of a bigger blockchain).

Votecoins won't work. Try answer some of these questions:
- How do you determine 1 voter had only 1 address?
- Who will issue the coins?
- How do you prevent someone who saves their balance for the next election? (Will you implement Freicoin? How wilrrl the candidates retain their own balance?)
You'll come to a conclusion that you will need a centralized authority in order to implement a workable votecoin. Which defeats the purpose of going decentralized.

There is no reuse. The challenge only needs to hold the funds once, and claim/reclaim it once. A single address is perfect for this.

I've also started running a full node recently on my PC too. Port enabled. I find it a waste to host a full node in data centers where there likely already has a full node there. Full nodes need to be geographically distributed to be effectively decentralized.

This statement is not very accurate for AU. There are banks that don't charge the account fee, or have a conditional charge depending on deposit threshold per month.

A while back I thought of the 'realcoin' concept before in my head for a bit. I figured it won't work unless it is under the reserve bank's control.
Trading a dollar for a realcoin effectively doubles the dollar (the coin going in, and the realcoin going out).
Once it has operated for a while, and the economy embraces a 1 to 1 exchange rate, the backer just needs to disappear with the real dollars. No one loses any value, the backer basically printed money.
Under the reserve bank's control they can fixate how many coins they issue. Since they can save money from printing, it may be economically viable to run a small farm across the states to process transactions at a constant pace. 
If anyone but the reserve banks do it, it is a scam operation IMO.

Exchanges are regulated. They need your details as much as any other credit card company. Exchanges are businesses. They need fees to pay their bills &amp; staff.
If you don't want to deal with that, why don't you sell goods and services for bitcoin? There is no one in the middle to charge you fees. Then you see that it really is decentralised. No one is going to stop you from receiving bitcoins nor charge you fees that are not necessary.
Bitcoin network fee is the only fee - and it is less than 3 cents (10 bits) for an average transaction. That is a fairly static fee for $1, $40, $500, $109,000, $53,395,230. If you know of any existing service that can transfer that money online, with 3 cent fees, please tell me. But please don't scan your dollar bills and email it to me...

For people who like to try this pitch again or in the future for shops you don't plan to revisit, maybe to avoid public ridicule, set yourself up to look like a foreigner or tourist.
Always follow up with another major currency that you don't have. E.g. do you accept bitcoin or euros (if you are in Europe, say another currency). Chances are, they'll say no to both before they get a chance to laugh about bitcoin, or gives you an opportunity to change topics / pay by credit card. Then pitch the idea that you don't like paying credit card fees (foreign cc txns have fees. Many can relate) and finish off there. If they want your euros dig into your pocket and say you forgot em.
Bonus points if you can pull off an accent. People don't usually laugh at foreigners. If they do, they make themselves look bad.
Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of giving away my money to the misinformed. So I don't waste time doing this. It's just an idea I thought up. You can probably think of your own unique idea.

Keep it simple. "Have you heard of bitcoin"? - regardless of what they answer (yes - that ponzi scheme?, or yes - that payment processor?, or no) you'll get a possible opportunity to explain further or follow up. unless they don't want anything to do with it, then you need to stop.
Don't go into detail in one blow. The more you do, the more it sounds like you have an agenda... Unless you are emailing a huge huge store/franchise, let them ask the questions instead.
Let them do the reading up - but you link the useful, reputable websites - bitcoin.org, wikipedia article (maybe), coinbase (usa) etc. Avoid smaller sites and blogs (opinions). Avoid reddit and discussion boards.
The point I want to raise here is that self discovery is important. If you spoon feed every info most businesses will write it off as a scam.
Edit: you're prpbably getting down voted because it sounds like you don't care about the business and only your agenda to push bitcoin onto them... See above. Good luck

I'm not a miner myself. A miner wouldn't disclose a sell off strategy in the open. :)
I thought it was 28nm. I could be wrong.
Most second hand miners will always have value, provided they aren't heavily antiquated (e.g. those USB miners), or dominated by new tech (e.g. introduction of ASICs against GPUs - arguably GPUs at least have another use). They're supposed to *drop* in value as new efficient machines are made though.
Discounted sell off isn't related to new machines coming in though. If the efficiency gain isn't that large of a gap you're better off just adding the new miner to your farm.
Sell offs are an exit strategy - something you need to plan for if you're a mining company because of the halving.

I reckon you can implement a representative state in another field to overcome this problem.
E.g. treat all integers today as 'weight 0'. When you use 'weight 1', your whole number is limited to 10,000,000, and this number represents 1 satoshi.
Send a mixed weight transaction and you can easily render it to decimal notation.
Eg. 120,504,830 weight 0 + 1,058 weight 1 = 1.2050483000001058.
To save disk space a 0 unit weight 0 should be implied without being sent if a weight 1 is the only amount sent.

They may receive less btc but that smaller amount is worth the same in dollars, and the previous amounts are worth more. They benefit if they held (and absorb the risk of its value dropping), but they don't lose out if they cash it at point of transaction using bitpay-like services.

If you're asking about the ability to do this, then this is already there. You load an amount into paper wallet (while you have internet access). You give the paper wallet to the next person (without internet). When that person has internet access, they sweep the funds off the paper.
What isn't simple: trust. You have to trust the person giving the paper wallet to not have another copy or giving you a blank fund. One way to go about it is to buy some tamperproof cards with preloaded amounts in it (like btc-card). But now you have to trust the company making the btc-cards.

If merchants continue to auto-convert to fiat, it won't come back 'big'. As a financial tool alone, it can't compete with fiat. It has to explore it's secondary function, that being that it is a free currency.
I realise you probably didn't want a political post, but sorry, here's one...
IMHO - the only way it will come back big is when a government or central bank really fuck up big time &amp; people look to alternatives - gold, USD (assuming it's a non-American fuck up), other precious metals, and bitcoin will be one of the last options.
Satoshi has said Bitcoin is an experiment that in 20 years time it will either succeed or fail. If I re-interpret what he can mean by that in the political space, it means Bitcoin will be Plan B against serious government/central bank corruption or fuck ups for the next 20 years (e.g. future bailouts, uncontrolled inflation, spiral of debt). If no corruption happens, bitcoin won't be needed.
Bitcoin wasn't created to bring people prosperity - it was created to deny corruption of monetary policy. See the genesis block.

They tag that address with the satoshi, and just follows future addresses until it reaches a point of exit that can get your identity. E.g. If you send that satoshi to an exchange with that linked address/satoshi, they can get your identity if that exchange collaborates with the tracker.
If you want to hide your identity, don't spend your money on coinbase/bitpay merchants. It isn't hard for coinbase/bitpay to ask the merchant for your identity/shipping info under guise of a legal investigation.
The risk is diluted if you support merchants using Straight/pure bitcoin because then the tracer needs to collaborate with every merchant and that makes it costly/not cheap.

Paper wallets were the technology that sold me onto bitcoins.  I had the "you can store digital value, OFFLINE?? Magic internet money!!" moment. So I knew most of the dangers/precautions before getting my hands cold (transfer full funds, watch your own addresses only, bip38 encrypt, offline printing, keep an offline truecrypt backup, etc)
That said, I almost fell into a paper wallet trap this weekend when printing new paper wallets to reorganise. I swept one paper wallet and it went to my hot wallet watch address (CoinJar) instead of being able to choose where to sweep to - didn't realise you can't choose!
I pulled it out but lost 20 cents (0.0001 x2) to transaction fees. If this watch address wasn't my own I'd have lost $180 (0.18btc).
2 lessons learnt: Never sweep. Never spy. Got rid of my CoinJar watch address too.
I swear this feature is silly usability. Why would you want to transfer to a random wallet?
Edit: Accidently a word
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:08:57
Yes, currently buying btc is not so great in AUS, services like CoinJar take forever to move volume due to their $5k limit. You start at $100 and slowly build up your maximum, or if you're verified you gotta bring $5k cash to a NAB branch every day, surely that'd be annoying/unsafe. Other exchanges/services have a higher fee (5% or more), having never used them I don't have any advice to give for those.
If you want to move the money swiftly and without legal gray area you oughta take the few thousand fees and go with a bank transfer (or find a service that'll wire it cheaper).
If you were only transferring a small sum, then maybe (even then it's more of an experiment). But playing with a larger sum (especially if you're doing something serious with it like buying a house) you're safer staying away from btc.

There's some obstacles for me as a spender:
- I don't agree with paying mtgox rates that's embedded in blockchain.info for AUD conversion. Or I may not agree with the usage of mtgox rates if someone were to impose that exchange rate on their goods
- the shops I frequent don't take bitcoins, and likely won't for a long time. In Aus we rarely catch the USA trends till it smacks us in the face
- paying takes too long (the act of taking out a phone and scanning the QR code) vs cash/card and I don't want to hold the line. I imagine it'll be a stretch for businesses to buy a POS terminal if transactions were already miniscule to begin with cos it may not even ROI, vs using an existing iPad/PC.

IANAL. But maybe plausible deniability. Just keep breaking up and sending those coins down to new addresses, no more than once a day.
You can't tell if someone has used it to buy something or transferred it back to himself. Even if you later join a few of them into a transaction, you could probably deny any association, if you buy from a place regularly for example it makes sense they can join up. Unless you join them all up... Don't do that.
I potentially see a change in tax structure if bitcoin succeeds, so in the end they might not even care - income and cap gains tax could be minimized or demolished and the difference will be transferred to goods tax which is easier to enforce in a crypto world.

From my experience as an internal web dev at a fairly large corporate.... Apps that go unmaintained, fall behind REALLY quick, and cost a lot more to upgrade in the future.
We have apps that were built 10-15 years ago. To compete against the innovations today you would have to rebuild from scratch. No one pays for software to be upgraded to do the same thing, because they think 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'.
It is like borrowing money. The more you borrow now the more you have to pay back in the future. Better we get over this hurdle now in a future-proof manner, than to have to come back in 10-15 years time with a double face palm situation.

You need trust because you don't know coding. If you know coding, you can verify the code yourself and therefore don't need to trust. In a banking setup - you trust the 3rd party with no means to verify.
An example: a book tells you 1+1 = 4. If you don't know maths, you trust the book because it comes from an authoritative source. If you do know maths, you know it's wrong, and you never needed to trust the book.
In a third party setup, you give them 1 + 1 and behind the scenes they calculate 4. You don't know how they derived the answer, and you can question them if it is wrong as many times as you want but they'll still give you an answer of 4. You are unable to verify because the formula is hidden, so therefore you will have to trust them.

Not really, unless you are telling me sha256 is broken in that way. For added security, you only send the raw code to peers for review. (link to a github repo, etc). Then compile it to check the hash.
Most people don't have compilers or know how to, but checking a hash is pretty straight forward (there are addons for Windows Explorer, online services, etc. And core devs can add that into the bitcoin core GUI if needed). You can send a fake hash into the blockchain but you can't fake a file cos it'll be picked up easily. Miners won't follow a fake file, neither will users.
The requirement is making the compile deterministic and maybe even decoupled from the C language family, as others have pointed out (I wouldn't cos this impacts performance). If consensus code can be segregated then most human consensus headaches with fork wars can be solved by the blockchain without causing a war scenario.

Use millibit. 0.001 = 1 millibit. Millibit is written mBit or mBtc. If you assume exchange rate is $1000 for a bitcoin then it's easy to imagine 1 mBtc = $1 USD.
Satoshi right now is a puny amount (like 10 thousandth of a cent or something), it's only a number worth using this denomination when you are trying to figure out the cost per unit of a large volume trade (such as in altcoin trading).
When we go to 1 microbit (0.00000100, uBit, or uBtc) = $1 (or $1M=1btc), satoshi will be the equivalent of cents.

I have to get back to work (on lunch break ATM), but it basically comes down to fee profits. If miners end up passing up .5 to 1 btc, some other miner is going to take them. This is probably why IBLT with infinite block size might work better - they're more likely to just include all transactions that is currently pending and take all the fees.
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:38:44
Let's try some math. Let's assume this gains 100% penetration of the market and every smartphone today has a 21 bitshare chip. All the miners today saw the futility of their efforts and turned off their miners, and bitcoin was mined 100% by chips (let's also assume it is still decentralized. Different pools etc. I don't want to talk about this point atm)
25 bitcoin are mined today. There are 2 billion smart phones. 2,500,000,000 satoshis generated every 10 minutes. Every phone would only be able to generate 1.25 satoshi at most. If they reach their goal of every device instead of every smart phone, one device can never generate a satoshi. Even less so every halving.
This means 21dotco are heavily dependent on a few protocol changes, could be either of or all of:
- side chains, where the users mine for a bigger integer reward but worth less than a satoshi
- infinite divisibility
Until these are implemented 21dotco can't be successful with their long term vision. Am I right or wrong on this? Correct me if.

Ah I guess you're right about my gains tax application.
I believe we still have to pay CGT though based on gains / appreciation in value when used for goods and services ("realised"). Unless you are in a pure barter trade (n gold bits for 1 banana) when you use the gold's value you first have to have a dollar value to peg it to (otherwise how will you know are not overpaying your banana with n gold bits?). In your other example if you trade bits of pieces of gold, you have a dollar equivalent to that amount of gold &amp; have made an exchange on the spot for the dollar.

It is only for guestimation purposes. Purchasing power doesn't mean you necessarily have the exact balance to settle the transaction. It means your balance has the power to start considering this type of asset / is within reach. You don't need to actually buy the said asset - just tap the address and get something more relatable like 300 cups of coffee.

A lot.
I believe in the distant, 100-200 year future, lost bitcoins will be mined via brute forcing (gravediggers/treasure hunters), while active coins will move to more secure addresses. Since the lost coin's owners won't be able to retrieve them, they'll get mined off the weak addresses i.e. what we use now (ECDSA).
If that fails to occur due to a stump in computing power growth, then someone will implement infinite divisibility by then.

His experiment is interesting. He can raise the block size in any client as long as he puts in a soft limit of 1 MB. Then anyone can change to his new client and hold the soft limit of 1 MB. If everyone has switched, that means it's successful, and a miner could experiment with 2MB for 1 round to see if it fails anywhere.
But that is best case scenario. Worse case, 50% moves and 50% stays, someone tries with a 2MB block and it fails but a percentage of miners push on with it and split the chain into two.

There is debate as to what to do once we reach the cap and start the deflation of supply. Most people want higher divisibility (or infinite divisibility) to counter lost coins. I used to think infinite divisibility is ok. Now I think it's more of a patch-on workaround rather than a full solution. A proper economic solution would be to reintroduce the lost supply of coins such that the economy is always at 21m. Someone linked me this which is a pretty good read of the two arguments for and against (IRC chat log):
If we just continue our "infinite divisibility" dream of adding new decimal places when we need it, there will be a point where we could run the economy with just 1m btc/7b users, and can be reduced to even 1 btc/7b users. Imagine the economic power of owning 50 btc by being lucky enough to find 1 lost private key. It's insane. You'll have enough money to buy the planet 50 times over. By continually circulating the 21 million btc we will have a more stable economy (21m btc/7b between generations) so the economy won't actually reach those lows.
One argument against it is it is basically theft. However if you don't want your coin redistributed just keep transferring it back to your own addresses and you'll get to keep your coin till your next address. If the expiry date is long enough (100 years) I don't see a problem - your human self would probably expire well before your coins do.
Another argument for it is cryptography will eventually lose power to growing computing power, making it slightly easier to find that lucky lost private key. We theorise today's cryptography can last us a hundred years, but can it last us a thousand? Then coin reintroduction would make sense - people will start moving their coins to new, more secure addresses, and the lost &amp; dead will leave the old ones behind. If we don't distribute the lost coins to miners, someone else will take it anyway. We won't be absolutely clear how that someone will use it, whereas we know pretty well how a miner will use it, &amp; we can define how much a miner is allowed to take vs the rogue who can take all of it.

Coinjar has a global daily limit for selling iirc. You could be stuck for a day on btc if you tried. Try another exchange.
Instead of transferring the bulk of your funds at once, why not try bit by bit (i.e. 1 btc at a time or so) so the risk from the volatility is minimised.

You can ask where the 4th party got their coins from. Then you ask the 3rd... 2nd, and you eventually reach the 1st, and 0th (the original owner).
Exchanges can choose to honor the stolen and mixed bitcoin and choose to blacklist/report it so you can try find this thief, or turn a blind eye for profits, but it is in their interest to blacklist it for a while to try catch the thief.
Justice can still be served, the blacklist also need not be permanent, just enough to be able to track down someone. If the hacked &amp; mixed coins get diluted too far and start to eat away at an exchange's profits they will stop, because it is almost irreversible. Dead simple.
The difference with golden nuggets, and bitcoin, is that one has an undeniable history and the other is perfectly fungible (and is best served with ketchup). If nuggets were stolen and mixed, there is no nugget-blockchain so there is no history of nuggets to trace; the thief can melt it and mix it all s/he wants, s/he still has/had stolen nuggets, you just have to find the thief before s/he sells it away on the Kentucky nugget exchange who may be clueless about the theft.
As long as the protocol doesn't block bitcoins on its own and gives this as a CHOICE externally then it is a perfectly fine position to take.

RE: Paranoid Satoshi
There is little chance he would destroy his keys for privacy reasons. I'm presuming you are alluring to avoiding capture by law enforcement - to do this (properly), it isn't just hitting delete - it involves running several passes of DBAN to wipe the contaminated HDD irrecoverably, then destroy the magnetic disks in the physical HDD and tossing its pieces in several bins a couple of miles away from each other as discreetly as possible, over the course of several weeks. If he was going through the care to do all that, he can also encrypt his keys inside a container file while on the contaminated HDD, transfer that file to a new HDD/USB stick, and then destroy the contaminated HDD. This way the encrypted file is just a random file to the outside looker and can't be traced back to the unencrypted original, but the keys are safe in case of emergency need.
RE: Philanthropist Satoshi
If he is a philanthropist and still believes in his invention, likely he is waiting until the fiat economy has evaporated, then there is no market for the recipients to flood. That could be 5 years, 20 years, 50 years. If he dies before then, the lost bitcoins are indirectly donated to us. If he has ill intentions, then it's going to be dumped to the market long before we see the collapse of fiat, and fiat will prevail for much longer.

Technically possible I suppose, the tough part is getting everyone (miners + nodes) to agree.
Personally, I think if you haven't touched your utxos after 140 years (well after the expiry date for humans...), it ought to be returned to the miners and re-enter the economy. There's ways we can make this fair. Like maybe 1 utxo per block only. Then miners would sort for a list of expiring utxos and pick the biggest to lowest and compete for the reward, in return we get additional PoW power for this period and prevent deflation from getting out of hand.
Since moving bitcoins around is so easy, 140 years is probably paranoia on my part. It's possible everyone can settle for 20 years and it would still be safe, people would just make a habit of moving money every 10 years or so.
Edit: the type of people who would probably disagree with a system like this are the 'get rich quick' guys (since this will no doubt poke a hole in their riches a little) and the kind of people who thought proof of burn/dumping coins to 'eater' addresses was a brilliant idea. Hint: it wasn't.

You're missing the point... His coins are being tracked by everyone now. The moment he dumps it, his details (whether fake or real) are going to get turned in to authorities/Bitstamp to further their investigation. Smart black hackers don't take these risks by trying to cash in on a legitimate exchange.
The coins will probably be held until forgotten (the internet never forgets, though), sold to a black market who can dilute and mix it, or used in point-of-sale in the future/in a dark market where no one cares or don't have the time to trace. This movement could very well be a black market sale already. We don't know.

Hi, I thought about this. Miners do have some power but without 100%, their votes will be wasted. If one miner with even 0.1% of all hashing power disagrees, their unhashed block will invalidate the vote and will need to start voting again. The longer the wait time, the more secure the consensus is. We need to pick a wait time that can statistically give that 0.1% miner a chance to find a block.
Also, the users are voting too. If miners aren't sending in the users transactions, they break Bitcoin.
Even If we reduced the user vote from 100% to 50% for example eventually there will be a vast more number of unconfirmed txns without that hash that miners eventually need add. If they don't some other miner will reap the fees and break the vote. (This might work better with IBLT, not sure)

2 hour block time average? How much hashing power in terms of % are you predicting is going to disappear? That's like a 91.6% loss in hashing power (if my maths aren't wrong - well, they're probably wrong...)

Let's use an example with games on XBL. They'll flash an advertisement to you when you're idle. You see the ad. It flashes a QR code after it finishes, "Purchase Now - 20 secs left". You scan it - it gives you a payment request, you pay it to that address, which was generated *specifically* for you. Your account is then credited with the game license, it starts downloading the game, the advertisements shut off, and in a few mins later the game starts.
Without you ever touching the XB controller.

To be honest we don't really know if the seeders are even honest nodes. They could be a hacked botnet that is serving the content until legitimate seeders pick up. Most seeders for legitimate content are replacements for FTP servers, easy way to cut bandwidth costs.
Also the older bit torrent users back in like 2007+ perpetrated a myth that 'if you upload faster, you will download faster', which made downloads cripple for anyone who was on ADSL (this myth is a bastardisation of more seeders = faster downloads). This slow speed probably made people feel bad for leeching and thus followed the recommended seeding requirement (leave your window open as long as possible on official Bittorrent client, or people watching their seed ratios on clients like Azureus/Vuze).

But it isn't the publishers making the charity donation, nor are we buying from them. It is via humble bundle. The funds go through HB first (otherwise fees). HB are merely retailers for the products.
For a publisher to demand the payment method between the retailer and the consumer is absurd. HB likely has a different payment rail when they send the money to the charities/devs/publishers (bank transfer) and that is the contract with HB and the those parties; it has nothing to do with the contract between HB and the consumer.
The publisher has no legal requirement to demand the payment method of a third party's business, they just fancy the clause due to the fact that they supply their product and can retract their product if they aren't happy. As a side effect it weakens the competition (Amazon Pay and bitcoin). It's a dick move.
Instead of HB just making it clear why they removed the option, HB decide to shovel this problem as a technical issue (or a frauds case issue, which is defamatory to bitcoin) as the reason why they remove the payment option, lying to people who have supported them many times. As a charity business this is pretty unacceptable.

Currently all the ATMs to date are glorified  AMLKYC registers and buying/selling machines. I think there is a slightly better way to design the ATM ecosystem, because these ATMs certainly aren't being used to full potential (esp. if you want to deploy a thousand of these stupid machines...). I've avoided my local machine in Aus Melbourne, cbd because the first thing it asks for is my mobile phone... I noped the fuck out of that.
1. If you need AMLKYC, do that _before_ the user operates the ATM. Set up a branch office somewhere and do it manually, or make it an online signup. That makes the machines easier to use the first time around, since you went through the draconian process in a friendlier or human way.
2. When a user deposits money, it should be denominated in the deposited currency.
3. When a user wants to withdraw, let them withdraw with two options: digital, or physical. Physical being the same cash they deposited. Digital being a bitcoin buy at the rate they were worth at withdrawal.
4. When they redeposit the bitcoin, that becomes a sell at the market rate.
5. Take it a step further and implement auto conversion wallets/cards.
This eliminates usability problems with the machines, and eliminates the problem of holding btc with volatile rates, at the same time gives the user choice to decide if they want to hold btc by withdrawing for speculation like we do currently. It works like any of the exchanges we currently have; the ATM just becomes the swift/ACH/transfer mechanism.

The payments go through to Humble Bundle, not to the publisher directly I imagine. HB are the intermediaries between us and the donation, not the publisher. It makes sense to me that the publishers are *not* supposed to be able to pick what forms of payment they want HB to give out and to let HB do what they do best.
There's not enough info to really say, I'm just speculating on what's going on behind the scenes when these contracts are written. It could be that I'm wrong and HB are giving the publishers the option to pick, but that is a very weird decision.
Anyhow. I don't suppose you know a workaround. It's not going to kill me if I don't get to pick up the games, so I guess I'll just check each day and hope the option comes back in the next few days. Highly doubt it though.

Another problem evident from the mailing list is that there's no real measure of decentralisation in terms of the block size debate, and what actually constitutes centralisation.
I can generally say that mining pools = centralisation, next to 51% (which is kind of like "deadly centralisation"). Running a higher block size will obviously increase reliance on mining pools, which limit what the definition of "safe" can be (i.e. limited to a home network). I think the best measure of "safe" is to look at the average cost of bandwidth charged by data centers. If it does not exceed a certain cost that *small* pools are willing to pay, then that should be "safe", because we don't lose the amount of 'centralisation' we already have.
25 btc - 1.5% pool fee = 0.375 btc * 2016*2 = 1512 btc in a month, at $230 USD this means $347,760 a month given to pools. I reckon that should be able to buy 3,477 pools (I need to double check the real prices, but last I checked running a fairly decent VPS with a few TBs of quota isn't that expensive). If I had to guess, I think we've only got ~100 pools that are actually Bitcoin pools, meaning there's a lot of profit being made that isn't used for helping the network.

Believe it or not, I haven't switched, but I like to tinker. My preferences so far are a slightly modified version of BIP100. 1) Votes only go up, 2) 32mb limit grows like BIP101. But no one else agrees with me so I just left it to dust and didn't bother sending it to the mailing list.
Rationale: 
1) you don't expect capacity to shrink when you usually want to vote up capacity to take increased volume of fees. So there is never a reason to vote down.
2) The 32mb limit has often been a criticism of BIP100. It makes sense to grow that limit over time. It will still be a challenge to vote up if it starts chewing up real physical resources that the network can't handle.
3) All the 4x proposals to date rely on miners to vote. So there is no better way to introduce the mechanism better than letting miners have full control over it, but vote each time rather than once, so we can be sure there is no history bias.
4) Even if the core devs disagree, the miners can collude together to do it on their own/hire some contractors to whack in the block size increase and lobby people to use it. (BTW to be clear, I'm not accusing Mike/Gavin of being hired by miners). As long as it doesn't introduce bad economics (e.g. undermine the block rewards) people will be OK with it, since many people here have a stake in making Bitcoin support a higher capacity and making it scale, as both are seen as milestones for success.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:21:05
It also needs a list of features and milestones ticked off that satisfies something worthy of a 1.0.0. (While worthiness is entirely subjective, that's the point of marking a 1.0.0 release.) Bug and attack free is definitely in that criteria though.
Would be fun to tick these boxes (my opinion, unordered) by then:
- private transaction amount
- infinite fractioning of the satoshi
- expire unused outputs after human lifespan for remining
- archival nodes
- automated and reusable hard fork process
- fast block relay (IBLT)
- transaction size compression
- max block size increase
- utxo database compression
- mempool to disk
- synchronised mempool (via sidechains?)
- RBF + CPFP (merchant fee burden)
- increased zero-conf confidence with RBF
- unfederated sidechains
- alternative private key algorithms
- optimise throughput bottlenecks
My mind is blank now but I'm sure there's more that people have been talking about. Very high level list so do excuse the lack of detail.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:11:30
It's not unproven, it's happening right now. People were paying fees when block size was not full for the past 6 years.
Before fees should rise, volume should rise, so you can capture your market. THEN you raise fees (prioritising/enforcing minimums) so you can profit off the market that you've captured and cornered. This is Twitter 101, YouTube 101, Facebook 101, reapplied to Bitcoin but with fees instead of ads. The only game theory that has changed is every miner makes different minimums. With good competition, an undercutting war should happen. With bad competition, collusion should happen where you will see high/constant minimum fees.
Miners can also implement minimums to float against their hash rate/energy costs. The fees have nothing to do with confirming faster, that's just a 'product' game. The real purpose of fees is to offset hashing costs; profit is when people overpay. If no one wants to pay these costs, the answer is to drop the hash rate and lower the mandatory minimum, until an equilibrium is found.
A truly altruistic miner will only mine enough to keep their farm running indefinitely in self-sustain mode (perfect competition). A profit-seeking miner will find ways to make the consumer pay higher fees than their hashers are consuming. Perfect competition is not an expected scenario, so there will always be miners who will want to make a user to pay higher fees, and they will do so by ignoring their transactions and let them confirm slow on purpose; the 'product'.
A small blocksize today only caters to the profit-seekers and assumes the current market is "fully captured" and doesn't expect to grow. A larger blocksize is to cater to growth first, and then squeeze the fees later. The best time to do this is NOW while the block reward is still offsetting all the costs; we can't expect the price of bitcoin to double every halving since that is far more unpredictable.
Miners can already choose to exclude feeless transactions and transactions with fees that are not worth their time. Some do so already. It's also why people mine blocks with 0 transactions, because it's clear that the reward is more important than the fees right now. Most are just following their pool's choices (which align closely to Bitcoin Core's defaults). Once the block reward disappears, Bitcoin becomes their product and it will be their responsibility to manage it.

IMHO, everyone should be rejecting Lightning Network as a solution to the scalability problem. It's a good system, but not for scaling Bitcoin. A reminder that LN basically defeats the purpose of Bitcoin by giving away custodial control in a timed manner. There is **always** risk of LN locking your funds for a long period of time than you can afford (e.g. need food/necessities). Irrational people (bad managers/bad employers) will do it all the time. Lawyers will do it all the time. And LN will be a tool for them to use to assert power.
The way people envision LN to work just doesn't work in real life situations. The use case requires you to send funds to it. Opting out means paying the highest fees imaginable, forcing you to stay within its system. LN is at best, a sophisticated payment channel/subscription network. Put some bitcoins in, subscribe to music/vines/youtube/movies/VPN/games services. There's no way anyone should take it seriously as a scalability solution to Bitcoin because of this time locked custodial control problem. When you implement it and you watch the fees go high, it's too late to turn back.
What scalability should be/should mean:
- Increasing capacity (i.e. block size) to safe levels (BIP101's doubling is not safe, but the initial jump to 8mb probably is). The definition of "safe" changes over time of course because of new technology/speeds.
- Reducing/compressing transaction size (there was an OP code suggestion on the mailing-list a month ago to reduce space by ~10-15%, at a price of halving the cryptographic security. I think it had the right heart, and IMO research should go here to reduce txn size without impacting security)
- Reducing validation time (libsecp256k1, libconsensus)
- Reducing network lag time (thebluematt's high speed network is pretty centralised; we need a better solution IMO; research seems to have been stopped because of the HSN)
Which will be supported by:
- the same fees we have currently (people pay fees even though block isn't full - this means fees are driven by perceived positive chance that it will be included in the next immediate block, and not driven by block space supply)
- higher potential volume of fees, meaning we can go back to encouraging more people to use the system until we reach a physical limit (~7 billion people or exhausted network capacity, whichever comes first).
- once exhaustion happens, even a small increase in fees will result in a large increase in revenue thanks to higher volume, creating a *more* sustainable/less of an arm's race-type fee market
Once you've exhausted all of these, *then* you go for alternative solutions. Hopefully without the centralised custodial control issues, and hopefully not reliant on mutually assured destruction as a security feature. For all we know, the alternative solution could simply be to run an altcoin per country to scale the system horizontally, pushing Bitcoin to become the reserve currency with a dual currency system. But at the moment Bitcoin can't even scale to support a small country.

Well the answer is simple... Mortgage contracts just don't work with a deflationary currency and in time the market and law makers will shift to a new paradigm. While you can loan bitcoin there's little incentive to do so because of the deflationary effect of price. So don't loan money, but do loan assets.
One example that many have drummed up before:
Purchasing large assets like a house without borrowing would become tricky, but not impossible. It would have to be done with a different type of contract similar to "rent-to-own" rather than a mortgage contract. Except most of those "rent to own" contracts today doesn't work because they don't give partial ownership of the house, which is where scams happen, and laws allow the scam to be legal.
But assume rent to own is legal, and well protected by law from scams, and you can own a portion of the house. Then the time-money valuation is irrelevant because you temporarily own the house from nothing - the same as making a mortgage loan from a bank using FRB style 'money multiplying'. If you can't pay the rent, then you take it to court to resolve ownership by selling it to a new owner, who will pay out a rent-to-own a % to each owner of the house. Or the original owner can opt to buy it back at a different rate depending on contract.
If you pay your rent, you've paid a settlement to a % of the house.
You can still do ordinary rent if you don't want to buy, and I would presume it would simply involve paying less than the market rate of a buy-to-rent.

No, they just don't use cents to trick people into thinking the denomination is smaller than it is.
Asian countries (Chinese/Japanese are two that I know of) count differently which might be why they prefer the currency numbering this way.
E.g. tens, hundreds, thousands, 万 ('man', 10,000), ten 万 (100,000) one hundred 万 (1,000,000).
Hyperinflation is what you see in Zimbabwe. One hundred trillion = $1 (or w/e the real rate is). The other high numbering currencies are business as usual.

The advice given in this article is wrong.
The 'money' you provide to bitreserve and similar **companies** to hedge value is still a counterparty risk. None of this avoids capital control since it still goes to a company, which must follow laws.
Only bitcoin on its own allows you to avoid capital controls, because it is a law-free technology. This means there is no way you can hedge the value to another currency. Any article or company that says otherwise is strongly misinformed or potentially lying to make business. There is higher chance you can lose all your money.

I would argue there are 4 variables - the cost of a bitcoin, block size, mempool size, and fees.
- High cost of bitcoin will deter spam
- Larger blocksize/mempool will absorb spam
- High fees reduce effectiveness of spam (slightly less txns per total burned)
We don't really need to care too much about fees when it comes to spam because we know legitimate users will price out the spam. What is important is for the network to absorb it so that it doesn't drop off the mempool/return to the spammer for a 2nd attack using the same coins. Free spam is bad.

@_date: 2015-07-19 14:18:01
You're right IMO. In terms of usability, Bitcoin is still a hard to grasp concept because of a few unintuitive stuff around using bitcoins. In no particular order:
1) Fees are paid by the consumer. This makes no sense, when the recipient is the one who is concerned with receivership of the bitcoins and should dictate the fees in order to receive it. CPFP should fix this, though it means 2 transactions are needed to do it.
2) The logical method of payment is QR code/NFC, but if you're browsing an online store via your phone, you can't really scan your own phone. Not enough services are adopting Payment Protocol. This restricts the online shopping use case to, "shop on PC, pay on phone", though in some areas of the world, like Japan, people don't use PCs, they just have phones...
3) Wallet safety doesn't 'make common sense'. People aren't used to "backing up" an "online account". So you need to convince them that this is common sense. For example: articulate this by using some UI trickery that none of this is online. Something stupid like showing 'Working Offline' on the screen, and then when the user goes to the options menu, only show 'Work Online [not recommended]'. (Offline being privkey stored on the phone, Online being some kind of web hosted wallet, designed on purpose to make it hard to register for)
4) QR code is ugly and generic. It doesn't look like Bitcoin until you scan it. Most people in the West **are weary** of QR codes because it is only used for promotional material, and lots of new people have trained themselves to ignore ads and promos (less people use adblock than do). It would be nice if someone can design a stylised QR code, maybe shaped in a Coin or a B. But QR code doesn't sound like an easy thing to design.

You don't seem to understand the problem. It's not about the bucket.
Their public sector is billions of euros in the hole. The private sector are being punished because of the public sector. I don't care how deep in the red their government are in. The reality now is the citizens of Greece can only withdraw 50 euros a day, and neither the austerity nor grexit options will benefit the Greek populace. The reason why there's still a vast 10% of undecided voters in some of the opinion polls is because they're not weighing which is better, they're trying to weigh which is the least terrible, otherwise the votes would be very clear. The fact is that they're both terrible options.
It's not this sub that needs to buy goods and services. This sub just needs to persuade the merchants to make the move. The outside world will decide if they will buy the goods or not. The problem right now is that they cannot because the banks are all closed, and even if they were up, no one from the outside wants to send money to a black hole either (in case the default occurs and their transfer wasn't recognised, the buyers could lose the products they were about to import).

Bitcoin already operates on data centres. That's what the pools are. If you haven't lost interest now, then you must see a completely different picture than I.
These data centered pools have no incentive to pay for higher bandwidth capacity because there is a strict definition of how much bandwidth is needed to run Bitcoin (the 1mb limit). See my post re: pool profits and how much of that could go to bettering the network instead of going into pockets.
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:57:35

That's the point of my past though. I'm looking at the long long term.
Fee seeking behaviours won't begin at 2140, it will happen much earlier, like around 2040's halvings when the cbase is negligible. Because the price of bitcoin is still trying to find equilibrium, we don't know when miners will start fee seeking behaviours e.g. if price doubles every halving then miners always stay in profit, and never need the fee market. If it stays the same then as soon as it dips below profitability, fee seeking behaviours will begin.
@_date: 2015-07-28 08:16:02
I think the point is you can now pay to execute code without needing to host your own server. Since the cost is now based on code complexity rather than server hosting, it saves you money. You still rely on oracles or APIs hosted by other companies (and API development is kind of a big deal these days). But you don't need to host etherium, since someone else can (like a miner/enthusiast) who has a vested interest in maintaining it.
The problem I think is going to be scaling. Etherium is going to run into the same problems as Bitcoin, and it'll host maybe no more than 10,000 small businesses, all competing for their code to execute. The cost would skyrocket. People will spin up their own private Etheriums and then we are back to square one.

No, I think Greece should be the focus point.
If Greece has a desire for bitcoin, we can still help them. If Greek merchants will export goods for bitcoin (via online stores/wholesale) to the outside world (and we are willing to buy the goods), they can get an inflow of bitcoins without outflow of cash. No need for euro transfer.
The problem is they want euros, which we can't give to them because their banks are closed. Until the merchants stop accepting euros, they don't desire a solution, they desire the status quo. And we can't help them with that.

I like Pieter's block sizes more than Gavin's because it is less crazy than 8mb + 2x every 2 years... But I still think Jeff's miner vote is still necessary so that block size is flexible.
I've been pondering what the best relationship between mempool and block size in the long term when miners need to rely on fees to profit. The best mempool needs to be one that has enough txns to be a minimum of 1 full block behind, and as the next block is found, miners can lock in a set and start hashing.
If the max block size is too big, and miners decide to clear out the mempool entirely, the next job will have nothing to do, or will have a very small reward. They can save money by turning off the miner for the next few minutes until a decent pool returns. This will reduce the difficulty over time which increases risk of a 51% attack.
Meanwhile if it is too small, the backlog will grow big and the system will feel slow and fees will increase. Some miners would want to open up the blocksize so they can make more short term profit by capitalising on the larger backlog volume (and eat up the higher fees before they return to normal).
Letting the miners change the block size lets them find this equilibrium imo.
Assuming num of tx only ever trends upwards on average, it makes sense that Jeff's proposal should only ever allow voting upwards in order to support the backlog.
Ideally the blocksize should be related to the mempool, but there are problems with synchronising mempools ATM.
(Of course, this is ignoring the cost of verifying and relaying a transaction. I'm just theory crafting atm, this is 12 years too soon).

Credit cards (the kind we have today) didn't tackle a fundamental problem when invented.

Previous forms of cards of similar kind were pre-paid/charged.
The same problem will occur had he forgotten his credit card. He fixed no problems. He added a new one.
Credit cards when they were first invented were meaningless to the average person too. Not enough places accepted them. They have to pay MORE than what they had to pay. It was a useless piece of plastic for the poor, but a luxury for the rich.
Just as no one cared about credit cards many years ago but flourished into society by sheer force of marketing and signing on businesses through massive call centers, bitcoin is about to trace its very steps, and it will take a few years for people to embrace it. Except we have no marketing department nor the overhead to sign up businesses.

Not changing the blocksize also changes Bitcoin's utility.
People today pay a txfee for a positive chance (perceived or real) of being in the next included block. That is a fee market. That market will change to pay-to-outbid next block if we reach capacity. That is also a fee market but a different kind, it is more aggressive.

So you're not really arguing against XT. You're arguing against bigger blocks, as if it would cause deep, irreparable centralisation. It's not XT &amp; Mike Hearn that you are against then, it's the rest of the community. It's mainly the community (miners/ users/commentators/exchanges), i.e. everyone but the devs, who are voicing that they wants bigger blocks than today's 1mb. There's only a handful of people arguing for smaller than 1mb. In the end the community runs with the changes, not the devs.
In fact, if we are frustrated with the current devs, anyone can just pay a c++ dev contractor and ask for the changes to be coded up and branched, then start lobbying people to use it (provided you prove your code - i.e. keep it open source). Clearly however, we aren't that fed up with the devs yet and we know they're doing excellent work and are eager to accept their proposals.
FWIW I also don't support BIP 101 on its own, simply because it tries to go too high (8gb) without proper study of its effects - Gavin has only tested up to 20mb iirc which is tiny in the grand scheme of 'big blocks'. I can only see it get popular if it gets merged into BIP 100 for replacing Jeff's 32mb limit or via other soft-fork soft-limit flooring proposals. Maybe a BitcoinVT will step up if XT and Core don't want to implement each other's proposals. But no matter how many step up to propose the solutions, the ultimate decision maker is the community (aka economic majority, aka majority consensus, aka us - the users, the miners, the exchanges, the commentators, the nodes).

Bitcoin can support peak traffic. That is what the 10 minute block process is for. Pending txns stay in the mempool.
Also I don't think visa and co doesn't really support thousands of txns a second. That is their network speed and write speed. Their real processing (consolidate txns and settle with banks) is likely done in batch jobs that are triggered on a daily/weekly schedule (overnight, offpeak) and then probably consolidated from various hub of operations in the countries they support to work out profit.
Bitcoin is superior in the fact it processes all of it in 10 minutes. It just needs a bloody block size increase.

You argue high fees are a good way to prevent/workaround spam which isn't really the case. If the spam is rejected by the network and dropped because legit users pay higher fees, the coins are still in the hands of the spammer. He lives to spam another day with the same coins. It is effectively free spam.
Spam should be absorbed in full so that it *does* drain their resources. That means keeping it in mempool indefinitely or storing it into blocks.
You can either let spam continue and let it be an effective way to raise fees infinitely, or deter spam by increasing block size to a point that it costs too much to fill it up for any meaningful duration and have no influence on fees.

It's pretty easy to figure out. Just make it a lottery with an entry fee. Lotteries are the most fair method that can only be gamed by increasing risk to oneself (buy more entries/sockpuppet accounts for a slightly better chance). There's a reason people don't do random donation driven lotteries in the real world.
The mods in that subreddit don't care about fairness and just want to continue its legally grey but politically correct donation drives. It sounds charitable on paper but on execution it is flawed.
I'm now waiting for Sidechains, which has the capability to build a decentralised lottery app.

Coinbase/third parties/Lightning Network is not the solution. That is passing the problem to another. All these offchain layers remove control of your private key. If you don't own the keys, you aren't using Bitcoin. In the case of Lightning, you lose control for a period of time, possibly longer than you can afford, if the LN Hub disagrees and refuses to sign the transactions.
Don't forget that what you are suggesting is centralisation, the very thing Bitcoin strives to avoid.
Bitcoin needs to improve itself on its own merits. If it must require a second layer in order to operate/scale Bitcoin, then Bitcoin IS broken.
Also, please stop your trolling with 'you must be new here' as you did with my two other posts. They're both within scope of discussion.

Bip 100 is two parts. The ONLY hard fork part about it is removing the 1mb limit/changing it to 32mb. That can be done separately from the soft fork part.
Bip100's main attraction IS the soft fork voting part.
@_date: 2015-09-01 13:57:52
No. How insulting. :)
This is 'bip100 is a soft fork' is luke-jr's interpretation (iirc).
Once bip100 removes the 1mb blocksize limit via hard fork, the remainder of the voting mechanism is soft forks (every vote) to move the size up and down.
Except the latest bip100 draft has a 32mb limit. It solves nothing, and really achieves the same result if the proposal increased the limit to 32mb with miners colluding to a block size of their choosing &lt; 32mb.
You can implement this voting mechanism right now with the 1mb block size limit. It doesn't change a thing in regards to max block size. It is just a mechanism to allow miners to agree what size they want collectively.

I always hate this point about a hostile takeover... What is there to take over?? They've released the bigblocksonly bip101 branch. It just hasn't been highly successful because miners clearly don't like bip101.
Even if no one bothered to compile the bbo branch/merge it to Core, and just downloaded XT to get the bigger blocks, they don't have to follow XT's next patch.
There is no hostile takeover, only choices we make and choices we don't make. We = the collective consensus seeking community.

You know what they say about priorities, 'if everything is high priority, nothing is high priority'? Applied to Bitcoin, 'if Bitcoin is everything then Bitcoin is nothing'. Our desires are spread too thin, which makes Bitcoin vulnerable on every front.
Let's focus on building up the currency component of Bitcoin first (scaling, usability, security, long term viability), before we dive into smart contracts (sidechains, colored coins). There is no point with decentralised smart contracts if the decentralised digital currency component isn't successful.
All these smart contract companies will go to waste if cryptocurrencies die.
Edit: whoops. Completely went off topic. But basically yeah that's what these agencies are trying to do... Make bitcoin everything, so that it becomes nothing.

Satoshi might be wrong with this one. We should still care how big it gets since we've discovered SPV's role in security is not that good. He may have envisioned SPV to be more secure.
Since long sync is a potential deterrent to new users running nodes (not discounting other deterrents), if we want to compete with SPV, we should think of ways to make full nodes lighter on the disk usage and sync faster (full sync, not headers-first).

On the topic of spam. Spam -should- be absorbed so that the attacker exhausts the money. The more spam we can absorb the less likely an attacker will try to spam the blockchain.
1mb is cheap to spam against. 1gb full of spam is a thousand times more expensive. For a period of 10 minutes, it might not be worth it.
If spam txns are dropped off the mempool they live to spam another day. So mempool needs to have high capacity too.

This is like saying we don't need IPv6 because IPv4 with ISP level NAT does the job.
Ideally you want IPv6 before IPv4 became a problem that needed a NAT workaround, in other words ASAP.

@_date: 2015-09-01 23:01:09
I also expect 0 fee to disappear entirely. But it starts with longer delays first because some small miner will probably still include it.
I don't think I'm missing the point. Scalability can work vertical (LN &amp; co, Inc. Block size increase) and horizontal (altcoins).
Before we can see if there is possibility of horizontal scalability (and not with cheap copies like Litecoin with small user base, but country wide scale supported by each country's citizens) we need to see the maximum that Bitcoin on its own can handle. If it can't scale to country-wide, then we need LN to scale that way, and if LN can't do country wide then we go horizontal.
My argument that LN is not a good solution is not because of the scalability it can provide but because of the loss of control and also the initial fee you need to pay to get in (in a high fee environment). It needs to work together with layer 0, not price it out completely. It is not great as an entire replacement for Bitcoin because the hub locking your funds longer than you can afford, when you get the chance to resolve the dispute via the blockchain you then pay a massive fee, forcing you to really 'stick to the game' by joining another hub. So you need the blocksize to increase so LN users can exit the system and still be able to use Bitcoin comfortably without paying massive fees.
It is great for subscription based payments (pay once to a hub, subscribe to many services). That is where I see LN really shines.
Edit: I'm at work, so if something sounds rushed/doesn't make sense sry. I'll fix later.

Private keys IMO aren't bitcoin. They're encryption/signature tools.
The OP codes that read and solves signatures are Bitcoin. I think if someone wanted a math/algebra based OP code they can code it in and it would work (not very secure of course... Anyone can solve an algebra problem).
This is why we can also eventually abandon ECDSA for a different signature scheme in the future.

Bip100 is mainly a soft fork. Essentially it's an agreement between miners. BIP100 style voting can be done entirely offline for example (and implemented as a soft cap) via 'miner collusion'. It solves nothing about the max block size because Jeff will put in a 32mb max block size.
Bip101 is entirely about the max block size.
It makes the most sense if both Bips were merged. This isn't a compromise - they both work well together.
@_date: 2015-09-02 12:57:47
A funny flaw in the first proposal, correct me if I'm wrong: after a double happens, all blocks after it would mostly become &lt;= 50% size (because you can't expect transaction actuals to suddenly increase with it), or the mempool will be swept up in the first few blocks leaving the remainder of the 2000 blocks undersized. So the next change would most certainly become a halving if the transaction volume stays mostly the same. Then it will go back up again. And it could endlessly do this until there are enough volume to stop the cycle.

Mark, the fee market already works. People pay fees today because of the perceived positive chance that their transaction will be included in the next block, and not to compete for space. The miners enforce this by intentionally delaying (via priority) the 0 fee transactions. In the future I expect 0 fee to be delayed longer than today's. But if the block size doesn't change, it changes the fee market to something different/something we are not used to and not ready for.
RBF is great for fixing your 0 fee mistake. CPFP is also great for merchants to bear the burden of paying fees (I.e. similar to credit card schemes) since consumers not paying the fee directly affects the merchant/recipient. But both are terrible solutions for block space.
RBF/CPFP is terrible in lieu of a block size increase because it encourages backlogging. The mempool isn't infinite and nodes don't hold the txns indefinitely. If you implement diskpool/caching then what's the point, if it is in the block then it is on disk, so just let it go into the block.
People also have to review their txn every 15 mins to see if it has confirmed, and if not they need to pay a fees race. If they still got beaten on fees, they have to increase the fee again for the next block. For a merchant trying to receive his funds so he can restock, it is painfully slow.
Picture the recent spam/'stress test' attacks with the supposed spam = everyday coffee txns, and picture that this is still continuing. How huge is the backlog? Will it ever clear by just using RBF &amp; CPFP?
Because of these problems, reliance on RBF/CPFP wont introduce a healthy market. It would be more reliable to just whip out some real cash. Or just increase the block size.
Added food for thought, LN is also not a great solution to block size issue, I'm aware of its benefits but an alternative to blocksize isn't one of them. Again it also changes the fee market to something we are not used to.

Premining works if there is an authority behind it. For example, if a government wanted to adopt cryptocurrency, and distribute the funds in exchange for paper based money that they're discarding. (Assuming normal cryptocurrency mechanisms i.e. once distributed they aren't in control, mining is distributed, decentralised etc.)
Most pre-mine altcoins have no authority and are usually scams, or claim authority / backing but really aren't.

Argument is fine. It doesn't need to be sufficient to the world's population. It just needs to be as high as the physical infrastructure can support, and then find out what we can do to improve afterwards. Trying to achieve the end goal without stepping stones is unrealistic and creates uncertainty - that is what Lightning is so far... A whole bag of uncertainty with no implementation.
Let's get Bitcoin to handle the size of a small/average country first, because 800k-20m-50m is more realistic a goal opposed to 7bn.  Let it be used by nations, before we think about worlds. If Bitcoin is successful as a macroeconomic model every nation will want to run its own decentralised, fixed supply blockchain based altcoin. I assume a centralised blockchain won't be supported by people when there are decentralised alternatives, forcing the gov't's hand and/or will have a need to acknowledge bitcoin as reserve currency.

This works the other way around: If Evo gave the coins to btc-e, btc-e can do whatever they want (non-reversible, right?). Evo are the ones who don't have the courage of accepting non-reversible transactions and are the ones doing the backhanded dealings to get around that fact.
Anyone who's been offered to take a shady deal from them can just take the btc, and then return it to the owner (or keep it if they can't dox you). So they're taking risks too.
They have no where to cash out and that could be a good thing for bitcoin - they'll have to wait or help develop a goods &amp; services market (i.e. further laundering) to take back their shady coins, instead of selling them now and crash the market.

Going to chime in my opinion: opt-in RBF eliminates the trust required with miners. You don't know if they're secretly running RBF right now anyway. Whether Peter Todd invented this is irrelevant, it was going to happen either way either with good intentions or with malice, so better to develop this with good intentions.
Perhaps the solution to this problem is simple. Allow Full-RBF up to the point where a recipient creates a CPFP transaction. Any transaction with full RBF that hasn't been signed off with a CPFP cannot go into a block, and this can become a consensus rule rather than local policy thanks to the opt-in flags that's inside transactions.
CPFP is needed so that merchants can bear the burden of fees (double bandwidth costs aside, and frankly if RBF is allowed bandwidth is going to increase regardless anyway). That's always the way I've being seeing its purpose. And this makes RBF much safer to use.

This. Money has never been perfectly fungible after being handled by humans. Gold coins also leaves human trace  (fingerprints, oils) so it isn't just the mints doing it.
You need to be very careful how you handle the money in order to remain perfectly fungible with the rest. And in the context of bitcoin that is equally true (storing all your coins in 1 address for example, makes you easily identifiable).
If you're sloppy then your fingerprints are all over the bitcoins. If you're careful then no one would be able to identify your funds are stolen. If you need to mix then you're probably already too late.

**Q: Why implement 'opt-in' and not just let miners go with straight up (full) RBF?**
Nothing actually stops miners from doing full RBF on txns right now without the opt in sequence no. flag. Are we just trusting miners here to play fair with this flag given it can't (currently) be enforced through consensus validation via CPFP or other schemes? If so it would rather be easier to just acknowledge RBF is here to stay and then no coding is required to Bitcoin Core.

I guess this is about XT and XT-like approaches, not necessarily btcd making that upgrade.
Because XT has no consideration about the old chain it is leaving behind, it has been labeled as contentious. It just intends to split the community into two (3/4 and 1/4) using a 75% voting threshold and hopes the 1/4 will join based on rational market choices. We know most people aren't rational though.
Quite frankly if XT updated the bar to 95% then most of this contentious hard fork debate should settle, or switch to just merely a hard fork debate. His points about letting the community decide will then start to make more sense.
95% = 200 min block time average for the remaining 5% miners with up to 40 weeks to readjust the mining difficulty, which should force them to upgrade otherwise they spend too much electricity for something only the forgotten minority will care about. That argument can't be made the same with 75%; while it is still costly, it is bearable until the difficulty readjustment happens.
For ref:
- 99% = 1000 mins = 200 weeks
- 95% = 200 mins = 40 weeks
- 90% = 100 mins = 20 weeks
- 85% = 66 mins = 14 weeks
- 80% = 50 mins = 10 weeks
- 75% = 40 mins = 8 weeks
- 50% = 20 mins = 4 weeks

The same can be said for Bitcoin. None of the tech used in Bitcoin/blockchain was invented by Satoshi. Even techniques like hash chaining is also nothing new. Bitcoin is based on ledgers, and that too is hundreds of years old (I don't think Satoshi planned a ledger based coin like that though. Otherwise he'd probably have called this project Bitbook instead of Bitcoin...)
What Satoshi did well was putting these apps together to create an app. It is the same as IBM's Adept. So I would give them the benefit of the doubt since they ARE creating live demos of all the DAC/IOT based visions we have been talking about.

That doesn't make sense either. Why does he need to protect the value of the coin by destroying it? The coin itself is value and valuable. Have you ever destroyed a US bill because it'll make the other US bills more valuable for the sole purpose of forex? No! You just lock it away and keep it in a vault, mattress or bank to reduce its supply.
 He could simply lock it away using encryption in case of emergency need. If he dies somehow, *then* those coins are destroyed. But wait! Dead man switches are a thing. If he wants a trusted someone to hold onto those coins post mortem, he can set that up (if he wants). Going the encryption route is far superior than destroying them.
Tl;dr there isn't a logical reason why he would destroy coins. If he wants to protect the market, he just needs to lock them.

While paper loses value, goods retain value. People have an rough idea that you need, say, 900 apples previously to buy an iPhone, for example. Of course this is all very hard to do and won't be immediately apparent to people who've just lost all their savings. Likely people would be trying to do barter first and overpay for goods, until they realize barter doesn't work in the long run and eventually need some numeric token. Whether that is bitcoin is a huge unknown. But let's run with it.
First you sell goods for btc. You have to entice holders to come to your country and start buying stuff if there aren't any locals. (Or not enough between locals). To do that you offer goods cheaper than they are, turning the country into a tourism destination, etc.
Govts who are in need of large amounts of btc for welfare  distribution to citizens can offer land, infrastructure, etc. for overseas investors to take up. Of course this gets political so it won't be a quick and easy process.

The fees will only get lower, so I think 10 bits fit the bill anyway for my little calculation. If it's wrong it's wrong, but 1000 txn/s is still a milestone most of us will celebrate :)
My rationale for lower fees: if you look at where bitcoin core features/innovations are heading:
- 20mb blocks to 4gb (or infinite?) blocks
- block pruning
- invertible bloom filter lookup
You'll get a very lightweight bitcoin network, where it's possible to fit all transactions into a block with little waste (not wasting disk space, not wasting bandwidth, not racing to propagate blocks). While 0 fee txns likely won't be mined in the future because there's no incentive to (not that there are any today), neither will low fees be passed up because it's so cheap to include any txn that you're basically just passing up free fees to a competitor miner. Which means fees could eventually go to 1 satoshi theoretically.
Floating fees are still client-side fees, miners haven't yet really demanded any fee. But the fees a miner demands is not enforceable beyond 1 satoshi because of competition (unless pools collide, then that's bad...)

Well this thread looks depressingly empty. Lemme start with a conspiracy theory of the week:
I just noticed thepiratebay no longer has a bitcoin donation address. I'm very certain they had one before the takedown, so I looked in the internet archive and found it. Not gunna post it here in case it's dead (there's still a 1+ btc balance though)
Here's the interesting part: If it's the same owner then putting the bitcoin address back there is pretty easy. They were reusing addresses. Alternatively the owner could sign a message with the new address, using the old key, which is the only way to prove tpb hasn't changed hands.
Why isn't it up? This suggests they aren't the same owner and is someone that doesn't support Bitcoin, or the owner has had a change of heart about Bitcoin (I'll come back to this point in a sec). I haven't been that involved with tpb news so I'm not sure if there was any legitimate transfer of ownership between the takedown. Anyhow lets assume it's either the real owner, or the FBI took it and the honeypot theory is true.
If it's a new owner, and a new address comes up without a signed message, then it may hint that ownership of tpb has changed hands. If they put the old address back there then they aren't getting any money, only the same person would do that. If they do put it back up, then we can view the blockchain and verify if that money is going anywhere. In fact looking at the funds right now they haven't been spent since 2014-10-17.
Based on this, if tpb was compromised, we're likely never going to see a Bitcoin address donation on tpb because the chances of them owning the key would be pretty slim, and they'll rather go with the 'I had a change of heart, I don't believe in Bitcoin anymore' story. So the longer we don't see a bitcoin address or a new signed address, the more the reason we should not use tpb.

Comes down to which card payment process genxwire is talking about then. Card is quite fast in most places that take NFC (at huge risk because they're usually pinless) vs swipe+pin, vs united state's archaic pen+paper signature.
Bitcoin sits in between. NFC can be supported so in theory it can be just as fast (safer too because of an extra confirmation screen to push funds), just not many NFC point of sale terminals yet. QR code is about as fast as swipe+pin if you have the camera ready/pre-loaded. Pen and paper signing though, I'm pretty sure bitcoin is slower here... :)
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:08:41
It's a hard-fork change though. Not so easy than just changing a constant.
Gavin wants to make it change every year to eventually move up the maximum to like 4gb. So it won't be a constant, but kind of dynamic value until we hit the end. This way he only needs to make 1 hard-fork instead of doing a hard fork each time we want to change the limit.
He first needs to prove that we can scale that high without affecting the network with spam/bloat. Which means he should look into adding anti-spam/bloat mechanisms with it at the same time (such as pruning).
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:56:05

No, you're losing me. What has confirmation got to do with a card swipe? If you want to talk about confirmations, then it is 90 days vs 10 minutes. If you want to talk about transaction processing, it is about how fast you can kick a customer off the point of sale machine.

If you're well off and have excess cash then you can do whatever you want (make sure you provision enough for things you want to do - education/studies/car etc).
Just be aware that bitcoin has dropped 80% since all-time-high and doesn't seem like there is hope of recovery in the short term. No one is saying it is a safe investment right now. I myself am still 50% in the red.
Start with $1 or use some free testnet coins (real coins are better though. Keeps you tense). Learn the payment system. If you like it and want to invest, invest AFTER you have learnt the system, not before. Make sure you know how to secure your coins from being stolen (read up on paper wallets), keep healthy backups, and don't day-trade/gamble it away. Don't trust anyone who promises a return on investment, and only buy from reputable exchanges, bonus if they're fully licensed (always check if you are not sure), but don't keep your coins on the exchange.

Gold re-entering the transaction space is kind of a big deal for gold bugs everywhere. Although the truth is they're not transacting in gold, just assigning a % of their rights to the gold away (almost like paper gold but not quite). It's not likely they're going to leave the vaults.
This could've been done with any currency, not just bitcoin. But the fact that the Bitcoin mania was the initiation of this new class of payment processing already speaks highly of Bitcoin and bitcoin.
If bitcoin doesn't fail, bitcoins could be pegged to gold de-facto through the free market. And that is a big deal for bitcoin bugs.
Possibly win-win? I might have a reason to  want to hold onto an ounce of gold now...

Coinbase is an AMLKYC clusterfuck. Same as with every other 'legal' exchange.
My bet is on ETFs leading the price. Then merchant and consumer adoption will stabilize the price. Exchanges play a small role in the future once coins stop circulating to exchanges and stay in real wallets.
In fact AMLKYC is completely ineffective if bitcoin takes off with merchants and completes the payment cycle, it only serves to stifle early investment opportunity.

Why would you do this? If the coins are redeemable you'd have a problem of requiring endless printing for the sake of making them redeemable. Horribly wasteful.
To design a paper cash system that is valid as a cryptocurrency (that we know today), you would have to use electronic based paper, and tills/money readers will have to redeem it at point of sale (safeguard in case it had been duplicated somehow). Once redeemed the e-paper needs to be refilled (to a new privkey which the e-paper generates). This could be done maybe by sending them off to a bank, who can then reissue out the paper.
But even then why would you want to do this in the first place? Cash is dying and ledgers are winning, ever since banks went digital. We ought to aim high and go for cashless and this benefits everyone (banks and bitcoin, the environment, etc). And the only reasons cash still exists is because card companies want a 2.9%+30c cut and a 40 year old generation who don't understand digital.

I don't see a problem, once combined with:
- SPV &amp; pruned nodes
- txn invertible bloom filter lookups
Assuming the benefits of these upgrades are realised we get an incredibly lightweight network. Miners can just include all transactions within the 10 minute block and take all the fees in that period.
The problem is they don't have incentive to take free txns once this happens. But that also means any fee is a good fee because to pass up on a lower fee means someone else can just take the txn they passed up.

With a card, reversibility can last for up to 90 days to allow for charge backs. That is akin to a 90 day confirmation. Any customer can phone their credit card company and claim a charge back quite easily (whether it is granted is at the discretion of the card company).
With Bitcoin, reversibility is very hard to do after 10 minutes, and logarithmically more difficult for every 10 minutes passed. In most cases, reversibility (I.e. double spend) is almost impossible even within the first 10 minutes for an average customer.
In both cases, you can take an unconfirmed transaction and consider it completed. Both takes only a split second to do this. Both carry risk. One is safer for the merchant and vice versa for the customer.

Or 2040, when there will be 1m of bitcoin supply left to be mined. 95.23% mined. 100 years to mine the remaining 4.77%. 0.05% inflation at 0.390625 btc per block.

One central server, one DDOS point. We don't need script kiddies taking down a national currency for a few hours and stopping breakfast, lunch and dinner for the day. They should at least create a semi-distributed central system and run a few nodes around the country. You can code in some signing requirement for each node so others can't spin up their own.
Anyhow. If the Greeks spin up their own inflationary centralised cryptocurrency, that is huuuge PR for Bitcoin. I don't think Varoufakis will do it, because if you build Greekcoin then it's super easy for citizens to support Bitcoin at the same time, and (you can almost tell) he doesn't want to give Bitcoin any legitimacy.

Beyond retail, Overstock is working at a revolutionary new development: a new independent stock exchange operating in Bitcoin and powered by Bitcoin technology. The new stock exchange, codenamed Medici, could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet. Overstock's CEO Patrick Byrne told Wired:
There is an opportunity to recreate the financial world as we know it in the parallel universe that is the blockchain. We are writing rules for this whole new universe.
In October, I interviewed Robby Dermody, co-founder of Counterparty, the Bitcoin technology platform initially selected by Overstock for Medici. Dermody confirmed that Medici will broker legitimate shares in companies, on the [Bitcoin] blockchain, and that there will be no specific Bitcoin industry focus.
In recent developments, Dermody and other Counterparty co-founders left the Medici project, which will include a wider variety of Bitcoin technologies, protocols and blockchains. No further details have been released, but interesting high-profile innovations in the Bitcoin space include the "programmable money" technology of Ethereum and the "sidechains" of Blockstream, which recently received $21 million seed funding.
In a recent interview, Byrne said that Overstock is building the platform that will let companies issue a crypto-equity, which is a new frontier with many legal obstacles. The Utah bill seems a first step to overcome the legal obstacles that stand in the way.
Overstock has been criticized for spending money on Medici and Bitcoin development. But I think the company is taking sensible steps in the right direction, and the potential payoff is huge.
