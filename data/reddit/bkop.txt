I mean my security for my account was IMO pretty good or so I thought. I have a 24 character randomized password as well as 2FA which was supposed to send me a text when someone signs into(Meaning when I sign into) my account

It had only been in coinbase storage for maybe a week or two before this happened was hoping to sell soon so I could do something amazing for my girlfriend but then this happened. I'm gonna call Verizon to check and see if anything has been fishy with my account around that time. Thanks for the info too is their anything else I should be looking out for

Fuck coinbase, I was told fuck em especially after my account got broken into and I lost everything, they said they werent at fault and they refuse to help me further.

Well right now my coinbase account is locked and will probably stay that way for quite some time cause I kind of just dont feel like dealing with bitcoin and coinbase in terms of buying right now or holding and ill be calling verizon now.

As a student who is slowly making his way towards having one bitcoin, why give it away, do you have the volume to just do so and not care?
