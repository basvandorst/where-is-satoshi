I got some in LTC and ETH but fiat needs more work than anything. Crypto is teaching me to save.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:47:33
I am very determined to raise my saving. I’ve cut my expenses.

He goes from 0 - 150 real quick when he disagrees with something or even get mildly annoyed. Like if you take a wrong turn or the pickle jar lid is on too tight.

Ripple just jumped over a dollar today, i was trying to buy last night around 82 cents but the transaction delay for fund was taking too long. 
My question is Ripple has been gaining a lot lately, do you think we are due for a correction or should i just jump in?

When did we decide to all buy Lambos? I thought it was Elon Musk car.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:36:21
Will this work if I currently have my BTC on Exodus?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:37:27

One day at a time. 
He’s very narrow minded.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:06:48
Feels really good man.

He’s very stubborn. But I’ll keep chipping away.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:11:01

My family is pretty shit.
But it’s my fam.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:40:46
My family grew up basically on the poverty line and it only got worse as we grew up and my parents got divorced. We now live on our own and he sometimes asks for cash (he has a good job but child support fucks him) so I thought I’d try to help him invest. I wanna keep trying bc I feel Bitcoin will be widely adopted eventually in the future. I love my bro and don’t want him to miss out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:35:17
Maybe I should do that then just when I’m about to give it to them years down the road, I won’t.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:17:28
Try keep comparing it to stocks and saying nothing is backing it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:42:47
Your brother sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:13:51
On one investment I’m up 270% in less than 2 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:13:20
I think about it all the time considering I’ve doubled my investment and for me that’s a lot of money to have at my disposal. I’ve been able to pay on time my whole life never really struggling by just getting by. Ive though of cashing out Then I think of what if it skyrockets the next day? I don’t know what my moon is yet. But we aren’t there yet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:19:13
They sell what I have to them for extreme gains.
Killer idea.
Edit: then*
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:55:49
So just make sure my BTC is in my coinbase wallet on these dates to get the fork dividends? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:41:12
That’s why I’m trying to help him get in early!
@_date: 2019-03-30 20:18:09
My wife told me it’s a scam. No no no
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:27:04

@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:18
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:43:28
i didn't even open an exchange. Just gonna wait.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:00
By now it seems normal and expected.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:39:52
is that why you buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:55:46
Well hey that’s my 6.66% post! 
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:35
Lets hope, i need to stack up.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:51
he cannot save us now.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:37:49
I rounded up.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:45:35
When I posted I had $58.
Now 8hrs later you say $60
Please update me every 8 hours on my hodlings.
Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:17:22
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:21:39
I’ve only paid 1.99 in fees so far. Where are you getting the 3.60?
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:49:44
Why would you say that? Bc I’ve never been through a fork before? Bc I haven’t learned from experience, only research? 
My understand is, the more bitcoin you have at the fork, the more 2x you get. 
I wanna see how the market swings with both then sell and hodl on the other.
I don’t know everything or a lot about it, but I’ve done enough research and put it money I’m willing to lose.
Tell me what I’m doing wrong or missing.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:04:05
Yes, a piece of what was once called plastic filled with random code that once meant something in the before times. 
Hodl it dear to your heart.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:40:47
I rounded all the numbers
I actually have $48.01 USD in BTC
Equalling 0.082421 in BTC
I bought it for EXACTLY $5824.97
Now you have the exact numbers lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:00:54
How will anyone be rich? With an EMP attack and no computers, how will you exchange bitcoin? Throw your Nanos at each other? I’m sure after something like that happens most people will be bartering in goods. Chickens and eggs and such.
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:46:15
No source.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:54:00
Updated the post sorry.
Actually found two locations! 
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:47:04
That’s just not true at all. 
They have had consistent beta updates to the app.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:36:45
BRD app is my go to mobile wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:41:30
For just $10 each I’ll paint a shitty Bitcoin logo on buildings in Rhode Island! Here here!
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:16:17
I use the wallet and store BTC on it. How can you say it’s not?
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:14:06
It’s a bitcoin wallet.
