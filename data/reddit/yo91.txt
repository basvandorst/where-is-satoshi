Not necessarily. In your original example, after the user's transaction including DAO coins, he ends up with: 
 * address B on ETH chain with a balance of 0, 
 * address B on ETC chain with a balance of 100, (unchanged)
 * address C on ETH chain with a balance of 100,
 * address C on ETC chain with a balance of 0 (unchanged).
You can see from your own example that it is possible for the ether to "split". So a given address does not necessarily has the same balance on both chains. Miners on the ETH chain will not accept transactions that further spend from B.
There are other ways to split. There is also a special contract that will route the funds to an address or another depending on whether it's running on the fork or not.
So when the exchange issues the transaction to credit the user's address in ETC, the source address doesn't have funds on the ETH chain and so it is not stored in a block on that chain. The user may control the target address on both chains, but he can only spend from one.

Yes they can withdraw their ETH for Bitcoins and buy new ETC with it. However they cannot "repeat the process" because the new ETC they get are *post-fork*. They don't exist on the ETH chain and can't be spent from there.

What to do when your cousin or whatever is actively asking for advice though? December was like they are going to do it anyway, just asking *how* to do it.

A rainbow is indeed light bouncing off water droplets. If you know the height of the Sun and the height of the rainbow you can determine the distance because the bouncing happen only at specific angles. 
I guess I don't understand your analogy.
