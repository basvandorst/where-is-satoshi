This is literally 98% of bitcoin investors, probably including the op. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:10:00
For now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:44:22
Should have waited.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:23:00
Bitcoin value is not rational.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:38:08
You can’t make money if you don’t sell before the others do.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:27:05
I bet it dips back into the hundreds and stays level for years before the next round.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:12:11
Bitcoin is a classic case of a speculative frenzy by bubble. Look at a chart that goes back more than 6 months. Nobody is adopting bitcoin for its purpose, everyone is on the bandwagon to make a quick buck. This won’t end well for most.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:34:19
I think most of these “veterans” have been in the game less than 6 months. That’s a long time to a 19 year old.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:47:45
Ding ding ding. You’ve just figured out bitcoin. Will you be able to Time the market correctly?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:43:06
You buy more and then I’ll sell.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:40:13
I know, I’m waiting for &lt;$500
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:19:23
It’s factual.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:45:01
You’re gonna be so pissed when Becky was right.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:37:05
Why would you do that?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:43:03
Crazy volatility is awesome for currency!
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:10:42
Nobody knew that then and nobody knows what’s next.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:32:00
Don’t confuse possible with probable. That is my friendly tip to you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:47
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:42:31
You’re not supposed to buy high and sell low.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:36:13
Everyone else needs to hodl until I decide to get out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:45
I didn’t think it was a difficult post to understand. If you really need me to elaborate, I will.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:03:38
Why stop now?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:57:46
I like to think of bitcoin as Beenie Babies. In 10-20 years will look back and laugh.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:25:16
How many real hodlers do you think there will be when the shot hits the fan?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:39:13
You’ll be super happy then when it’s selling for less that $300 again.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:44
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:22:49
Everyone has to learn about value, market correction, bubbles and so forth at some point. I hope this lesson won’t be too painful for you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:15
Is it a dip if it keeps dropping?
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:47:48
Kind of like a Ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:13:10
Ouch, it’s gonna hurt when you remember this post after you hodl too long.

@_date: 2017-08-15 12:17:49
All crypto is still shitcoin. Most people buying crypto right now are doing it for speculation not for its fundamental use.
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:47:59
I'm waiting for sub-$1000.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:52:02
You did well. It's not going to dip it's going to pop. And when it does...
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:34:31
I'm always shocked how optimistic people are on reddit about crypto...
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:49:14
The best time to go all in is at the top of the bubble!
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:16:42
When does the bubble burst?
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:22:14
Everyone preaches my hodl is going to eat it.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:25:47
We will see &lt;$500 again. Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:16:26
No, there's no way this train is going anywhere but up. /s
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:26:26
Many exchanges delay your ability to get in and out.
For a relatively small market there seems to be a high amount of hacking and/or lost wallets. I don't have statistics but I think this is a big hurdle to trust, adoption and use.
I think mainstream adoption as money (as opposed to mainly speculative purposes) would be the strongest indicator of real value.
This rally started 2 months before the fork and continued right through. Surprisingly the tech aspect seems to have not phased the rally much.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:51:53
You added a zero.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:09:58
Look how long bitcoin was sub $1000 than a massive rally started 3 months ago. Bitcoin is still inconvenient to get in and out of, susceptible to hacking, isn't anywhere near mainstream use after how many years? Tell me again why this isn't a bubble.
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:13:31
Bitcoin is manipulated.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:48:53
That’s not what I said. What I was getting at is that young people don’t usually have a bunch of income they can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:52:49
It hasn’t been debunked. Bitcoin fans just disagree. Huge difference. Basically your whole argument is that bitcoin is different than every type of investment vehicle and bubble that came before it therefor not a big bubble. That’s a weak argument with no substance.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:44:46
Where did I say all investments are bubbles? You are just creating a straw man at this point.
I’ll simplify this for you. Very few people are actually using bitcoin for its intended purpose, as a money or internet of money (it could even be argued that it has failed to really take off in this manner). People are using it for speculation. People did the same with Tulips. It’s also the same reason people bought extra houses they didn’t intend to live in during the housing bubble. The only way to feed a beast like this is for more and more investors to pump more and more money into it. There are many smart investors in bitcoin right now and they will pull out when they think it has peaked and there are going to be a lot of suckers that get hurt on the long fall down.
Save this post as a reminder and we can talk again in a year and see where bitcoin is at.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:22:26
I’ve been waiting for it to fall since $1100.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:16:07
You mean 600-700 right? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:31:20
Nothing happened in the last 9 months to increase its value to $20k and even the $9k its at now. It’s not an investment, it’s just speculation. It’s a game. It will bomb and people will hate on it and in a while there will be another cycle.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:44:08
By that logic there shouldn’t be a finite supply of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:51:30
240... 629... 4200... one of these numbers doesn't look like the others.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:16:48
I’m joining in 3 weeks!
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:45:30
Are you 12? Judging from your post you got burnt bad. It’s just the internet dude.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:15:04
It has been a relatively steady decline.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:11:52
Fair enough. Hope it helps.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:59:37
Or maybe he's on to something...
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:20:02
I’ve been waiting for the dip since it moved to $1,100 less than a year ago. $8k is still hyper inflated and super expensive. Wake me up when it hits $600.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:15:25
I hope this isn't a recent decision,
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:45:35
No, cumulative greed happened. People heard of the massive returns and jumped aboard the crypto train.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:44:29
You don’t consider what bitcoin did in the last few months to be hyperinflation? Crypto has been crazy volatile.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:44:32
Explain how it works and we can test your theory.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:12:21
If you just figured this out...
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:02:27
But bitcoin isn't much like investing either.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:11:51
I’ll give you a Bitcoin tomorrow for a hamburger today.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:12:55
Alternately, its $5000 due to hype and should be closer to $200. It's coming.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:01:45
Except right now it's primarily used as a speculative "investment" tool not as a revolutionary new money even though bitcoin is getting old...
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:46:36
If you are one of those people, you should really evaluate your life choices. You’re going to get burned if you haven’t already.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:03:20
It still can. I'd bet that it will.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:05:16
Wouldn’t people just stop mining until/if the value rose above mining cost again?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:28:04
Because people can’t really time the market. Ocelot may have bought high.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:18:20
But that's the problem with bitcoin in a nutshell. If nobody actually uses bitcoin for anything but speculation, it has no intrinsic value. It's just everyone betting against each other.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:43:52
Some selling would have to happen to know the current rate. Of course is demand outstripped supply, the price would increase. 
You would have to support your 3rd paragraph with actual data for it to be meaningful.
Here is bitcoin in a it’s current state: I have a rock I take behind a store and tell people “hey let’s assign a value to this rock, we all buy part of it and that increases the value. If we all believe this rock has value and can convince others, our value will climb. After all there is only this one rock. Certainly, at some point we will want to sell our portion of the rock but only when we think the value has climbed as high as it can go.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:13:27
You are on to the problem with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:34:09
There will be a few winners and many losers. Hodl at your own risk.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:15:04
People talk about shitty business practices all the time. People are doing that here.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:07:29
But we’re not. Things like this have happened before in other speculative vehicles. It doesn’t end well for most.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:14:50
Look at the long term charts. Does history necessarily predict the future? No, but it's one of the best indicators you have to make an educated guess.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:51:48
Im afraid it might break your heart.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:47:58
I’m a believer. I’ve been saying it since $1100 all the way up to $20k.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:27:28
Tell is how it goes.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:11:46
Did you just respond to your own comment with a snarky rebuttal? Or are you being serious?
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:33:45
I’m sure you will use the not a true Scotsman fallacy as you are already “sure” but here are a couple examples:  tulip bulbs seem to be a very apt comparison. Tech bubble, the more recent housing bubble. Only Bitcoin is more like tulips because it’s value is so silly.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:08:51
How does bitcoin increase in value without money being pumped into it? I don't mean theoretically, show a real life example.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:05:47
I love the way reddit crypto thinks. It’s the bro-science of investing and economics. Thanks for the laugh.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:31:30
Maybe the trend you are looking at is indicative of the opposite potentiality. Look at a long term trend. See that massive bump on the right side. That should be good for thought.

It’s also possible that a unicorn will fly through your wall at any moment. I think it’s healthier and more realistic to base life decisions on the probable rather than the possible.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:24:44
The bitcoin can be infinitely divided. Add to that, Bitcoin is more of an idea than something tangible. It’s primarily being used as a tool for speculators.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:07:24
Ding, ding, ding! For all the winners there will be exponentially more losers. If you don't understand this, you'll probably be one of the latter.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:08:39

It's not worth $250 until the exchange has happened.
What if you had an apple that could be infinitely divided into smaller apples so that everyone could have a piece of the apple? The infinite divisions are less but really they are all apples just the same because they don't exist as real apples, more as an idea.

Maybe hodlrs are just people trying to manipulate the market.
