This sounds like a cult I can get into! I’m down as long as the churches have windows. We should also have weird and crazy religious practices so I can do weird shit in public and claim its part of my religion.

Nothing really backs the dollar either, so I never really understand the what’s it backed by argument. Bitcoin can crash to zero, the Stock Market can crash to zero, and the dollar can crash to zero. Theoretically, anything can happen. But, I think Jon Stewart really did make this comparison, it seems like his type of humor. This joke was probably made after one of the many crashes of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:41:44
Did you login on gdax side it’s the same login you use for coinbase. It lets me transfer from coinbase to gdax on there, then I transfer to my Trezor and it doesn’t charge me a fee.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:39:35

The Winklevoss twins believe in Bitcoin, we should support their exchange and make their exchange bigger than Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea anyway.

Thank God CNBC also pointed out the housing bubble before 2008, also I guess every company in the dotcom became completely worthless, and I guess tulip exchanges wrote every tulip exchange in stone to make transactions more transparent.

Brian Armstrong and Roger Ver. Looks like Brain Armstrong blacked out last night.

No I’ll probably just go sell explosives illegally, convince people there is nothing wrong with Mt. Gox, and tell people that Bitcoin Trash is the real Bitcoin (flick people off for calling it Btrash in an interview) then do some insider trading on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:01:34
On the login screen on coinbase type in each email you think it could be and click forgot my password you should receive an email from coinbase for any email registered with them. Test out any emails that receive an email to change your password and check those accounts. I hope this helps

At every ATH it has always been thought it was too late to invest. Bitcoin has been in a “bubble” since it was $300. This is not investment advice btw. Just trying to show that without future information it always seems like it is too late to invest. Realistically you probably won’t become a millionaire but if your investment beats inflation that’s pretty good, because most banks don’t. You should do your own research before you invest. I’m just some guy on Reddit while I believe in the block chain technology, no one knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:13:30
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:34:16
Well bitcoin is also rare due to limited supply. Calling something beautiful is subjective doesn’t add value. Other jewelry such as diamonds are worthless and only have value because they are a monopoly. You can gold plate other metals to make your gold holdings appear more valuable than they actually are, but you can’t fake a bitcoin.
In an apocalyptic situation why would you collect gold? Bottle-caps are the obvious apocalyptic currency.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:56:36
Well you convinced me brother I’ll buy some Bitcoin Gold. I’m interested, what childhood toys you got? You got anything good? But how will I know it’s actually your childhood toy? I’ll need at least six independent toy experts from across the world to confirm it’s legitimacy. If I lose this toy can I bring it back by reciting 12 magic words? But seriously if you have a 1st edition Charizard I would be interested.

TIL: Bitcoin is racist.

How much money would you be willing to throw at mining equipment? What will be the throw out percentage of your hashrate be of your equipment? Could you set up the equipment to mine by yourself or would you need to hire professional help? How much electricity will your mining equipment use? How long would it take for your mining equipment to match the gain from if you just invested the money right now given the current momentum. What if bitcoin just crashed in value? There are too many what ifs for this question, if you had perfect information this would be an easy question to answer. Not trying to talk you out of mining bitcoin just wanted to give you things to consider.

Well my gold must be worthless because I can’t use it anywhere. I should probably sell it since it’s probably in a bubble and only seen as a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:26:40
Bitcoin is dead, I’m a coroner.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:08
But it did dip at 11k the first time, it went down to 8700 I tried to buy it at the time then but coinbase crashed and fucked me. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:07:19
So sell?!?!?

I hope they sell it all and throw it into to bitcoin. If they haven’t sold it yet they hold a significant amount of it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:14:47
My brother sent me an article about the bitcoin bubble crashing when it dipped down below 12K. Thank God he did, I wasn’t watching the price and I was able to buy more.

Gold is in a bubble! Why is gold so valuable? Why is it worth so many USD!?!? It’s not like you can keep gold in your wallet. You can’t go to your local grocery store and buy goods with it! Sadly �� many people have invested millions in it, but it’s in a bubble! Some “experts” think �� it’s only worth $1!!! Everyone needs to sell it because I haven’t even bothered to research gold!

Fiat isn’t backed by anything it only has value because people perceive it to have value, since governments control, regulate, and distribute it. It’s a lot easier to launder money with fiat than it is with Bitcoin. You can counterfeit fiat, but you can’t counterfeit bitcoin.

Sell $50 worth of BTC for a crisp $50 bill. Get a nice shiny money clip and put that $50 bill in there. This way you can keep the robber on his toes by saying “You want this money, go get it!” And you chuck that sucker as hard as you can.
