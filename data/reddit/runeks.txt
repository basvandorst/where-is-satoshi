I'm surprised I hadn't stumbled across electrum-server before, in my search for a way to query the UTXO set. I'll have to take a closer look at that.
What differentiates this server from electrum-server is that, as far as I can see, electrum-server only indexes the UTXO set (current balances) rather than the entire Blockchain (current+historic balances).
All the data is about 120GB, out of which 10GB is for testnet3.
With regards to performance, you're probably better off asking about that, who wrote the patch for Bitcoin Core to enable the address index, which basically does all the hard work (in combination with the UTXO set queries). I just wrote a fairly light weight RESTful HTTP wrapper around it that uses a couple of RPC calls to get a list of outputs paying to a specific address, optionally filtering off spent ones.
**EDIT:** Also, electrum-server doesn't expose a Blockchain HTTP interface, so it can't be used in the browser. This server can be used, for example, to create web apps that query the Blockchain.

Looks beautiful! I won't get around to comparing data just yet, but it's good to know there's a RESTful interface to iterating through addresses, I haven't seen that before.

OK, I understand now.
What are these applications? I'm interested in knowing because I didn't know payment channels were actually being used now.
With this protocol you get a funding address that funds the channel directly, you don't send coins to a program that then sends the funds to wherever they need to go.
@_date: 2016-04-18 20:48:58
What are "app 2.5 applications"? I've never come across other payment channel implementations than that in bitcoinj, but I guess this is an online service then? If so then it's basically a closed protocol, so yes, this, open, protocol would not require sending your bitcoins to someone (which really defeats the entire purpose of a payment channel in the first place).
As I understand it, Lightning Network is a lot more than just payment channels, and it's not implemented yet. It's an entire payment network, with routing and whatnot. But I don't even think the specification is finished yet. I think a payment standard channel standard makes sense now, and has value, but it's possible that someone will make something to supercede it in the future, that's difficult to know.
If that is the case then yes, with this protocol it will no longer be necessary to send your bitcoins to anyone before being able to open a channel.

It would have been much simpler to just demand that all stock issuers have a clearly stated policy on insider trading in their prospectus. This way there's no reason to prohibit anything, if a company lies in their prospectus, and says it doesn't do insider trading but does it, then it can be sued in court, for breach of contract, and fraud is already a crime. If a company declares in its prospectus that it does not limit insider trading in any way, then investors are free to not purchase these stocks. Perhaps NASDAQ and NYSE would have their own rules regarding insider trading, so investors don't have to read the prospectus of every stock they buy. It really isn't necessary to create a new type of crime, and transfer all responsibility to the criminal courts when the civil courts can handle most of it just fine.

No he won't.
In the latter case he will charge 3.95% less than the first, unless he automatically adjusts the prices up 3.95% for all the visitors who are ultimately going to see the latter payment option (no fee PayPal, discount Bitcoin).
But for that to work the store/site owner would have to randomly decide, every time a new visitor comes to his site, whether he wants to display regular prices (and upon checkout show this:  or adjust all prices up by +3.95%, and show this  at the payment step of the checkout process.

They may mark the transaction as "paid", but the merchant doesn't receive the money in their account until after 6 confirmations, in the case of Bitpay at least: 
Bitpay does *not* reimburse the merchant if it delivers the good after 1 confirmation, and a double spend happens after that.
Coinbase is a little different, in some regards. Coinbase has a wallet service as well, which means that they can safely accept 0-confirmation transactions from their own wallets -- they can simply refuse to double spend coins from their own wallet service. But Coinbase also accepts transactions in the same way that Bitpay does (user sends from his own Bitcoin wallet), and I'm almost certain that they don't eat the loss either, in case a double spend happens.

Example: I don't want to run a Tor node because I don't want to ease access to child porn or assassination markets. Consequently, I don't run a Tor node. Now, if it were possible to run a Tor node that denies access to sites that offer this content, I might want to run a Tor node, thus increasing anonymity when accessing sites that I do not oppose, while not helping pedophiles gain access to child porn.
This has nothing to do with censorship, as I am the one operating the Tor node, and I have every right to decide whether I want someone else using my Tor node to access child porn.

No one is saying p2pool.org is not legit, ie. not a pool. It is a pool. Just like all other pools. That's the point.
P2Pool, however, is not a pool. It's a decentralized mining protocol. Using this decentralized mining protocol, you get the advantage of mining at a mining pool (low variance) while still keeping it decentralized (your node checks that all transactions are valid).

You need only the following to verify a block:

This is the real problem. Forget everything else until we solve this.
How does a node prove that it is storing the blockchain? It can't.

No. Not unless a wholesale bullion supplier that accepts bitcoins exists at that time. As you say, it's impossible for Amagi to price bullion in bitcoins (unless a Bitcoin-accepting wholesale supplier exists): they would go bankrupt in a short time either from lack of sales (if the price is too high) or arbitrage: people buying bullion on Amagi for cheap and selling it somewhere else at market price (if the price is too low).

Actually, it's worse in some ways.
Let's say I want to send $50,000 to someone (around 100 BTC or 10,471.20 LTC at current exchange rates).
Looking at all the order books of the major exchanges, to gauge total market liquidy, we can see what it costs to sell and buy BTC and LTC (in exchange for USD), which is required to transfer USD.
Here's the current market data:
    10,471.20 litecoins can be purchased right now for 49,108.16 USD on Bitfinex, BTC-e, OKCoin
    10,471.20 litecoins can be sold right now for 47,132.33 USD on Bitfinex, BTC-e, OKCoin
    =4.192% fee
    100.00 bitcoins can be purchased for 47,529.57 USD on Bitfinex, BTC-e, OKCoin
    100.00 bitcoins can be sold for 48,093.05 USD on Coinsetter, ANX, Bitstamp
    =1.186% fee
So it costs 1.186% in fees to transfer ~$50k USD using BTC, and 4.192% using LTC.

No, I agree. 10% per year isn't bad, but no one knows how much the investment will return. When a prospectus says the goal is 10%/yr, I assume it's more likely to be 5%/yr. Ie. I would like some margin of error for their claim, and at 5%/yr it's way too risky (I'd rather buy Intel or Berkshire Hathaway stock, which have roughly the same year-on-year return).
Intel has *proven* that it can get a 5-10% return per year on capital: 
This company is simply claiming it can get 10%/year.
I'd much rather invest in an established company with a 5%/yr return than a new, unknown company who claims 10%/yr returns.

It's not magical, it's the block subsidy. No one "pays" it, as such. It is new money. This new money can be used to buy stuff with, so if the recipient of the new money spends it, he is wealthier. And we all know that the creation of money does not produce new wealth, so if the recipient is now wealthier, someone else must be poorer.
When new money is created, and spent by the recipient, real wealth is transferred from all holders of the money in question to the spender of the new money.

No it's not.
Speculators who are right help the market, and are rewarded for this. Speculators that are wrong hurt the market, and are punished for this.
Say a speculator suspects that the price of oil will go up. What does he do? He can either buy oil or a futures contract on oil (the right to have oil delivered at a certain time in the future). If he buys a futures contract, he doesn't have to take delivery of the oil and rent storage space, so he choose to buy an oil futures contract.
The act of buying something lifts the ask price - buying it gets more expensive. So the ask price in the futures market has now been raised. This incentivizes owners of oil to not sell it right away in the spot market, because they can get more money for it buy selling a futures contract against it, and delivering it at a later time. This means oil is conserved for later use. If our speculator is right (in that we will soon experience a shortage in oil), this is exactly what we want.
It also creates an opportunity for arbitrage in the market. Someone can buy oil at the spot price, and simultaneously sell a futures contract against it and make money that way. This raises the price of oil in the spot market. Again, this is exactly what we want if the speculator is right. A higher price both reduces demand for oil, meaning we consume less oil, *and* it encourages oil producers and potential competitors to produce more oil, because the market can now handle it (there is more profit to be made than before). Again, this is what we want in case of an impending shortage.
This works the same for cars, oranges and computer chips.
Speculators play a very important part in setting the price of goods and services, which help to coordinate their production and consumption.

Take a look at this Python code: 
1. Convert data to a large integer. You basically just treat the data as a base 256 number, and convert this into a base 10 integer.
        __b58chars = '123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        __b58base = len(__b58chars)
        long_value = 0
        for (i, c) in enumerate(v[::-1]):
            long_value += (256**i) * ord(c)
2. Continually divide this integer with 58 (the number of characters in the base 58 character set) and use the remainder to determine which base 58 symbol to add to the base 58 string.
        result = ''
        while long_value &gt;= __b58base:
            div, mod = divmod(long_value, __b58base)
            result = __b58chars[mod] + result
            long_value = div
        result = __b58chars[long_value] + result
3. Add a '1' character to the base 58 string for each leading zero byte:
        nPad = 0
        for c in v:
            if c == '\0': nPad += 1
            else: break
        return (__b58chars[0]*nPad) + result
It's exactly the same as converting a base 10 number to base 16 (hexadecimal). Except the character set is not "0123456789abcdef" but "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz".

As far as I can tell form the mailing list posts, he's not advocating censorship, he's advocating that users have right to decide if they want to block certain sites. Now, I'm not sure if not fixing the bug is the wrong way to go about it -- it probably is -- but Tor node operators deciding for themselves which sites to block does not constitute censorship.
Censorship is a private property violation. It is, for example, when a government physically prevents a newspaper from printing a certain article -- eg. by confiscating their printing press -- the private property of the news paper owner has been violated.
In the case of an operator running a Tor node, and deciding for himself that he wants to block certain sites, no private property violation has occurred.
I'm running the Deluge BitTorrent client now, with the Blocklist plugin. This plugin downloads a list of the IP addresses of, supposedly, known copyright holders, plus the MPAA and such, and blocks all connections to these IP ranges. Am I "censoring" something? I'm only refusing to connect to the peers in question, and I have every right to do that.

Your private key is used to sign transactions, proving you are the owner of the address in question (you do this when you send bitcoins from your address to someone else's).
Your public key is used to *verify* that the signature you've made with your private key was really made with your private key (clients and miners do this to make sure that transactions are valid, and that only the person with the right private key can spend coins sent to a specific address).
Your address is a hash of your public key. A hash is a one-way function. Anyone can calculate the hash of your public key, but no one can calculate the public key from the hash.
With the public key, the signature and the address (a hash of the public key), you can verify that someone has the right to spend some coins by first hashing the public key, and checking that it corresponds to the address, and then checking that the signature is valid (using the public key).

If this dream is to come true, it must be *easy* to use, and it takes some time to create a UI that users just get (a lot of back-and-forth between developers and actual users).

But if millions of small organizations are supposed to issue and sell tickets all by themselves, it needs to be easy.

What if you buy an old 1960 Mercedes-Benz 220SE, that you drive around in for a couple of years, and sell that with a profit? Do you owe taxes on that profit?
I think the reasoning in Denmark is that if you buy something without the intent of making money on it, and you do, it is not taxable.
Another example is taking a trip to the US, and buying $5,000 for the trip. When you return to Denmark, and have $2,000 left, if the USD exchange rate has gone up and you sell them for DKK, you don't owe capital gains taxes on it, because you didn't intend to make money on it.

One way to mitigate the risks almost completely is to have both bitcoind and your custom implementation running. Your custom implementation faces the real network -- talking to peers, exchanging new blocks and transactions -- and bitcoind is running on a LAN. Every time your custom implementation receives a new block from the P2P network, you pass it on to bitcoind, and you check whether your implementation agrees with bitcoind on whether the block is valid. If they disagree, your custom implementation temporarily accept whatever block bitcoind says is valid, until you can figure out why they disagree.

I promise you, it's *much* harder to mess up compared to a paper wallet printed from bitaddress.org.
With Armory you have an offline version of Armory, running on a computer on which the wallet was generated without being connected to the Internet. And it's never connected after that. You then have an online Armory, which is on a computer connected to the Internet. You can see the balance of your offline wallet in the online Armory, but you can't spend from it. To spend, you create an unsigned transaction on the online Armory, transfer the unsigned transaction to the offline device (old laptop/netbook) where you sign it with offline Armory, then transfer it back to the online Armory, and publish it.

Allow me to quote myself from this post: 
I try to explain one of the fundamental problems of proof-of-stake: as a completely new node, who hasn't downloaded the block chain (transaction history), how do I decide which block chain is the right one?
Think of proof-of-work: if I were to create an alternative Bitcoin block chain with the same amount of work as the current chain, I would have to calculate trillions of hashes: this takes time.
With proof-of-stake a checkpoint is required on the protocol level, because there is no way to differentiate between a chain that people have been working on for a long time or a completely new chain, that someone just mined, because the *time* aspect is lost.
Compare that to proof-of-stake: my mining power is defined by my balance, not any tangible/physical thing like processing power, so I can create a new block chain, assign coins to myself, use those coins to mine more coins for myself, and so on and so forth. There is no "work" in this chain, that enables people to see that this new chain I've just created, is not the one that all the other people use, because it requires no effort to produce it, because it doesn't use proof-of-work, which does require work/effort.

Can you give an example of at least one instance where the Bitcoin Foundation has instructed Gavin in what he should be doing? I'm of the impression that this does not happen.
Jeff Garzik, who is also a Bitcoin developer, works at BitPay, and he develops software for BitPay, including Bitcoin Core.
I think you are making incorrect claims, or at least claims that you cannot prove. The proof would be an example of, for example, BitPay or Coinbase contacting the Bitcoin Foundation, and instructing them to tell Gavin what to do, the Bitcoin Foundation doing this, and -- last but not least -- Gavin complying. Can you give such an example, or do you just think all of this happens behind closed doors (hence me calling your claims unprovable)?

Here's an example of how I imagine it could go, if two blocks were received close to each other:
1. newblock_1 80 byte header is received (timestamp noted: 1407509247)
2. newblock_2 80 byte header is received (timestamp noted: 1407509249
3. We start querying for ~~unknown~~ transactions in newblock_1
4. We start querying for ~~unknown~~ transactions in newblock_2
5. Fetching all ~~unknown~~ transactions from newblock_2 finishes (newblock_2 finishes first, because it's a smaller block)
6. We verify newblock_2 and start mining on a block that extends newblock_2
7. Fetching all ~~unknown~~ transactions from newblock_1 finishes (it shouldn't take that long to fetch transactions)
8. We verify newblock_1 and start mining on a block that extends newblock_1
So instead of a pool mining on the wrong block until the network finds a new block (avg. 10 minutes), it only mines on the wrong block until it has all the information required to verify the block that came first (in the form of a block header).
**EDIT:** Fetch *all* transactions, not "unknown".

The point is that Ripple doesn't replace old, outdated protocols (SWIFT, SEPA) for transferring value: it sits on top of that layer. Bitcoin, on the other hand, changes the process of actually transferring value, and makes it cheaper and faster.
That's why I think Ripple will not replace Bitcoin, because they don't compete against each other, they complement each other. Ripple is basically a compatibility protocol between various ways of transferring value (SWIFT, SEPA, Bitcoin, etc.).

How so? If I mine with, say, 1.5 PH/s on P2Pool and the rest of the P2Pool miners have 1 PH/s, how will I gain from a 51% attack on P2Pool?
If I ignore all other shares in P2Pool, and only build on my own P2Pool blocks, I only get paid out whatever 1.5 PH/s gets me. If I do build on the other miners' shares, I get 1.5/2.5=60% of 2.5 PH/s, which is exactly the same.

Because the dollar is decreasing in value exponentially (~2%/year).
If bitcoin retains the value it has (which just means that the price of goods and services priced in bitcoins stays constant), then the USD price of bitcoins will increase at about the rate of the CPI (which tries to account for USD inflation).

That's not true. Decentralization is a continuum, not a binary either/or. Systems can be more or less decentralized, they aren't either centralized or decentralized.

95% tax means that you get to keep 5% of what you earn. That doesn't sound right.
The top income bracket is 60%, including the 8% "work tax":  ("Skatteloft, personlig indkomst").
If you earn $200k per year, you earn $101,385 after taxes, thus you pay 51% in taxes: 
Now, if you were to buy a car with that money (180% tax), you'd have paid $200k (money you've earned from working before taxes) for a $36,208 car (before taxes), which is 82%. So I don't think it ever gets to be 95%. Still a lot though, I agree with you on that.

We aren't talking about hashing, we're talking about a block chain.
The purpose of a block chain, in the case of Bitcoin at least, is to secure the content of it with proof-of-work, so that it can't easily be altered by a dishonest node. Thus enabling a network with only a majority of honest nodes (as opposed to a network consisting *only* of honest nodes) to reach consensus.
There's no reason to call a simple linked list a "block chain". That doesn't help to understand either of the two concepts.

* Do users if dollars need to keep a receipt every time they exchange dollars for other items? No. Do you have to do this when using bitcoin? Yes.

You're right about Bitcoin, because its supply is limited. So, yes, I made a mistake in that regard. If, however, the supply of Bitcoin was not limited, there would be no reason for the market cap of it to necessarily increase by *anything* just because $210bn worth of it is bought.
Market cap is calculated by supply*price. So if the purchase of $210bn worth of bitcoins didn't move the price, then it wouldn't affect the market cap.
But again, as I said, a purchase of $210bn worth of bitcoins *must* move the price, because at the current price this equals around 250 million bitcoins - over 10 times as many bitcoins as can ever exist.
An instructive example is the following. Let's assume the current price is $825, and the BTCUSD order book looks like this on the ask side:
    PRICE   AMOUNT
    825		100,000
    826		10,000
    827		10,000
Someone buys 100,000 bitcoins for $825 each. $82.5M has just "moved into" bitcoin, yet the market cap is exactly the same as it was before. $825\*bitcoins_in_existence before, and $825\*bitcoins_in_existence now.

Depends on what you mean by (on-chain) "micro-transactions". Are we talking a cent, or a thousandth of a cent? The former might be possible (with a reasonable fee), while the latter probably won't be.
For every 200 byte transaction you send, the Bitcoin network stores 10,000 times that amount of data, because every full node stores a copy of the blockchain, and there are currently around 10,000 full nodes. So that's a total of 2 MB of data for every transaction, currently.
If you want to pay a reasonably low fee on a one cent-transaction, say 1%, the fee would be $0.0001 per transaction. Say the Bitcoin network manages to scale to 10,000 transactions per second, that's $86,400 in revenue per day, shared between all miners in existence. Competition will be steep, so only a fraction of that will be profit, that can be used to expand the network, and protect it from attacks. I'm not sure that is enough money to run such a network with reasonable security.

I don't remember Armory having this limitation. And I know it's not required on the protocol level (a parent and a child transaction can easily be included in the same block).

Don't forget that we had to pay a miner 25 BTC to mine [the block that included this transaction]( (and 1589 other transactions, in the same block).
So the price for this transaction was more like $0.04 + (25 BTC ÷ 1590 transactions * 376 $/BTC = $5.91) = $5.95 in expenses to the miner, for this transaction.

There is a difference between difficulty and hash rate. The hash rate changes continuously, as miners join and leave the network. The difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks.

Can anyone confirm these numbers? The variance figures seem too low to me: "3% monthly variance for a pool with 0.8% of the hash power".
Do we have any actual data to back this up?
A useful dataset would be looking at P2Pool variance as a function of its share of global hash rate. My gut feeling says it'll be a lot higher than max 3% per month when P2Pool has 0.8% of global hash power.

Hardware wallets are not related to the Bitcoin protocol. We are talking about the Bitcoin protocol here, not how people manage their funds. A hardware wallet does private key generation and signing using ECDSA. As long as we don't remove these key types from the Bitcoin protocol (which we have no reason to do), it won't make them obsolete. It will only mean that the people with hardware wallets need to buy new hardware if ECDSA is compromised.


As I already mentioned, TCP/IP is a much lower-level protocol than Bitcoin.


I disagree. Redesigning from scratch would mean throwing out hardware worth billions of dollars. That is not a good solution by any means.
In any case, we cannot predict what features Bitcoin will need in the future, or if we will regret adding or removing features now. The best we can do is design for what we know, not some unknown future. That will have to suffice, because it's the only way we can do it.

Well, since you know when the address is a correct one - with fairly high probability - you can effectively use it for error correction, provided it doesn't contain too many errors.
If there is only a single typo, you just have to cycle through each symbol, changing it, which gives 1914 combinations (58 symbols \* ~33). And you could probably do a lot better by only substituting letters/numbers close to each other on a keyboard, or ones that are close to each other visually (q/g/y, v/u, etc.).
So, yes, in principle the checksum doesn't contain error correction data, but it can be used as such.

The accuracy of market predictions is measured in profits, not blog posts.
I could, in theory, start 100 different blogs, each describing a different course of the price of bitcoins. Statistically, *one* of these blogs being right is quite probable. The problem here is that blog posts are free, so making predictions are free. It's the same situation when you have 100 different people all blogging about the future price of bitcoins: one of them is likely to be correct, even by chance.

It's about not needing a random number generator for creating signatures. ECDSA signatures need a random number to create the signature. If you create two signatures using the same random number, the private key can be calculated from those two signatures. This change makes BitcoinJS avoid this pitfall by not requiring a random data for the signature, but rather deriving the random number in question from already available data.

To prevent denial of service attacks. Publishing transactions with a lot of key check operations means every node has to check the signatures, which can take a while (usually around 1 ms per signature).

7 billion people generating 1 million addresses per second for 100 years yields:
7×10^(9)×10^(6)×3600×24×365×100 = 2.20752×10²⁵ addresses generated
There are 2^160 (1.46×10⁴⁸) possible addresses, so the chance of one of the ~2×10²⁵ addresses being one of the 1.46*10^48 addresses is 1 in 6.6×10²².
The chance of winning the Powerball jackpot once is 1 in 175 million. Winning twice is 175M^(2): (175×10^6)^2 = 1 in 3.0625×10¹⁶.

I think this makes sense, and I believe this was predicted by some people on bitcointalk.org a long time ago. Another service a pool could offer is a discount on transaction fees if you can provide a certain number of transactions per day -- sort of like a flat rate charge for confirming transactions -- so that large wallets can get a discount on transaction processing because they provide a lot of volume (similar to how BitPay probably gets a discount when selling BTC on Bitstamp).
I think this is a natural evolution of the market. And not something that's of much concern. I agree, however, that security-wise, it isn't optimal. The more decentralized mining is, the more resilient it is (at least short term), so we lose some of that. But I feel fairly certain that the market will be able to survive from a large mining pool going bad. It might cause a temporary setback, but I think we will learn from such a mistake and it will be less likely to happen subsequently.

Bitcoin's core functionality (transaction history consensus) is not strictly based on cryptography. It's based on proof-of-work, without which it couldn't function.
I very much doubt that any concept of proof-of-bandwidth can exist based on cryptogaphy alone. It would be a complex cryptosystem (like Bitcoin), but perhaps such a system can be designed, so that the incentives to honor the rules are there (again, like Bitcoin).

No. It uses a salt. You can't construct rainbow tables.
There is no re-arranging of chairs going on. It's a race against time, sure, but that's exactly what you win by choosing a strong passphrase - time. If the time you win is enough, then you're secure. One way is choosing a very strong password, another way is using a sufficiently strong password (with, say, 40 bits of entropy) and a key stretching function (with a salt).

To the devs: please don't burn bitcoins by sending them to some address you've made up. The result is that all bitcoind clients will keep this address in memory, in case the coins are spent, slowing down all full nodes.

Exactly. They can always produce more USD. That's not the issue.
Or, actually, that *is* the issue, the underlying problem of our current monetary system. We can print money (USD). This is problematic because money is supposed to be the economy's link to the physical world. It should reflect the scarcity of the physical world. We can't print copper or steel, so being able to print the money that *buys* copper and steel is problematic. It gives money creators, and the people close to them, cheap access to actual physical resources. But the reduction in actual wealth (as a result of consuming resources) is spread out across all holders of USD (the definition of privatized profits and socialized losses).
In Bitcoin, we use proof-of-work to link coin creation to the physical world, by requiring the consumption of energy to brute force a hash function. Requiring energy to produce coins limits coin creation, because energy cannot be produced from nothing, so bitcoins can't be either.
Gold is what used to connect the abstract economy to the underlying physical reality of scarcity. And we've lost that.

The point is that you're making it worse for other people, and disadvantaging yourself at the same time. You're not helping anyone if you limit it too much.

No, I agree it boosts privacy to a certain extent. But Zerocoin takes the privacy to a greater level, since with Zerocoin you can't associate inputs with outputs. This is still possible with stealth addresses.
So if, for example, someone withdraws a certain amount of bitcoins via Bitstamp, Bitstamp will know which address they went to, since they were party to the transaction. If this person then sends money to Silk Road, from this address, and Silk Road is busted and Bitstamp is subpoenaed to release that person's transaction details, the authorities can link this person to Silk Road. This is not possible with Zerocoin.
That being said this is pretty awesome, and a huge step forwards in privacy for Bitcoin. All done without having to change the protocol. It's pretty impressive.
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:18:42


I agree.


As I mentioned, the probability of an address with a valid checksum being the right address is fairly large (about 4 billion to one), and the probability of *both* changing the address so its checksum is correct *and* it matching an already existing address is incredibly small - about 1 in 10⁴⁸ if there are 4 billion addresses in existence.
If that is a practical problem then the address space is too small to begin with.

Beware that it's currently not recommended to do so. The reason being that initial sync of the blockchain is only done via a single node currently, and Bitcoin Qt will only drop its connection to a node it's doing initial sync from if it goes offline.

Because lowering the interest rate -- making it cheaper to borrow money -- generally does not affect the "price level" (CPI) in countries where people don't borrow money to buy food, gasoline and pay rent. I assume that when you mention "general price levels" you're talking about the CPI, which measures, among other things, the price of food, gas, rent and other consumer products (electronics, for example).
What it *does* increase the price of, are things that are bought with borrowed money: real estate, stocks, commodities. *Very* few people buy a house with cash. Lowering interest rates decreases the monthly mortgage payment, and people can consequently afford to pay more for housing, and so the price of housing rises.
Stocks and commodities are also bought using credit in the case of trading with leverage, which becomes increasingly necessary in order to earn a good yield in an environment of near 0% interest rates.

* US Legal tender laws demand that all debt can be repaid in dollars.

This isn't true for most web wallets. With most web wallets, all the information needed to unlock a particular wallet is stored on the server itself (the bitcoins are stored in the "hot wallet"). It's not encrypted on the server, where the user provides a password to decrypt it. At least I've never heard of such an implementation.
Blockchain.info is unique in this regard, as they don't store your unencrypted wallet. They send you an encrypted wallet, which your browser decrypts for you, so it circumvents this problem.

The people who get too concerned with how many people own *x*% of something miss the picture. It really doesn't matter how many people own the majority of wealth in bitcoins. Right when Bitcoin was started, one individual - Satoshi Nakamoto - owned 100% of all bitcoins in existence. Was this to be a predictor of its future success? Clearly not.
Right now, if we assume the numbers you reference are correct, 900 people own 50% of all the bitcoins in existence. Why would this be a predictor of Bitcoin's success this time?
The point of Bitcoin is that it's a free market, where everyone has the same level of access to the currency. This is unlike our current monetary system, where banks have a privileged position in the chain of money creation.

Have you done more for Bitcoin than BitPay has? BitPay pays Jeff Garzik to work on Bitcoin Core. So BitPay is basically donating a full time Bitcoin developer, who -- among other things -- works on Bitcoin Core.
That's one of the problems I have with this discussion: does anyone really know how much Coinbase or BitPay does to help the community? You say:


Which is untrue. BitPay pays Jeff Garzik, and I wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase also employs a developer that writes for Bitcoin Core.

Please post a reference to a site stating that there is no minimum fee. I doubt that there isn't. The 1-4% is on top of the minimum fee, I'm fairly sure.
Here's VISA's page on fees: 
VISA charges a: Card service fee, Data processing fee, Multi-currency fee and an Interchange fee is charged by the card-issuing bank (usually rather small).
The page contains no figures on the first three fees, charged by VISA, but the Interchange fee (charged by the bank is from €0.02 to €0.22, as far as I can gather.
Also, [this PDF]( states that merchants may require a $10 minimum transaction amount for VISA credit cards (but not if a debit card is used). I suspect this is because there is a minimum fee, and it would become too large if it's part of a transaction that totals less than $10.

If a merchant asked you: "*Why should I be interested in accepting a currency that you seem so willing to get rid of?*", what would you answer?
*Store of value* and *medium of exchange* are not separate properties, they are two sides of the same coin (no pun intended). You can't have on without the other. Since bitcoins are easily transferable, having value is sufficient for them to work as a medium of exchange. The only thing left is for people to be interested in holding them -- why else would they accept them in exchange for goods and services?
If we really want to prove that bitcoin is a superior currency, we shouldn't want to part with it unless there is additional benefit compared with spending traditional currency. Why would you prefer to get rid of the currency you allegedly think is superior?
If you would rather spend bitcoins than traditional currency, it shows that you're more willing to hold traditional currency. Why would a merchant be interested in accepting something (bitcoin), that you apparently aren't as interested in holding as traditional currency?

Good question. This lead to the question of how one prevents fake positive reviews.
In my quest for an answer, the only solid solution I've found is proof-of-burn: with every transaction, you burn *x*% of the value of the transaction. So if you buy $200 worth of items, you burn, say 5% ($10) in connection with this transaction. This should be public knowledge, verifiable by everyone. This means that with every merchant, you can verify that they have burnt $*X* worth of bitcoins, and you know not to trust them with more than a certain percentage of that, or otherwise it would be profitable for them to cheat you.
This is necessary because reviews must not be free, if they are they have no value (as merchants can just accumulate as many of them as they want).
There are other solutions, like a "web of trust", but I don't think they work well enough.

How can you claim a Bitcoin IOU is money if no one is willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services?


This is caused by asset/liability duration mismatch, not fractional reserve banking in itself.
I have 10 ounces of gold, and I deposit them in a bank as a 1-year time deposit, and receive a time deposit certificate for 10 ounces of gold. There is now 10 ounces of gold in a safe in the bank. Now the bank takes 8 of these 10 ounces and buys a 1-year bond with it. Now there are 2 ounces of my gold in the bank's safe, the other 8 have been lent out to the issuer of the bond in question.
No new money (gold) has been created. 8 ounces of gold have been lent out to someone, but I don't have access to my money until after 1 year, at which point the money will have been paid back by the issuer of the bond.
This is an example of asset/liability duration match, and no new money is created.

No I'd say it's a proof that people really like stuff that is free. :) Of course people want it if they think they aren't paying for it. Free stuff rocks.
If people aren't willing to pay for something, it's not worth it to them -- by definition -- wouldn't you say?
Also, it's $500 2010-dollars, not $500 1960-dollars.
I would say this is one of the main strengths of capitalism: if you want something, you have to compensate the people who use time and resources on making it. Everyone wants a Mercedes if it's free, but not a lot want one when they have to pay what it costs to produce. I think that's a *good* thing, because it saves resources when people don't think the end product is worth the cost.

I don't think it's a money-issue. I just don't think people want to spend the time when the simple solution seems to work (for now).
We very well might think that miners *should* be willing to set up their own `bitcoind` node, but as we see when looking at the hash power share of mining pools, this is not what they do.


There obviously is. Otherwise everyone would be running a full node.

The only reason the money we use now has value is because people wish to hold it (although these reasons are partly due to legislation (legal tender laws, capital gains tax, etc.)). When you wish to hold something as money, you are willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services. The mere willingness of people to hold a commodity makes it a money -- the greater their willingness the better the money.

No. I mean, theoretically, it could, but in practice people have very little incentive to be wasting their expensive mining rigs on discarding valid blocks.
Think of it this way: you have a gold mining collective. Each gold miner who is part of this collective has a way to prove, without question, how much time they've spent digging for gold. Whenever a gold miner in this collective finds gold, he can either discard it (destroy it), or give it to the gold mining collective (he cannot keep it for himself). Whenever a gold miner in this collective finds a piece of gold, and gives it to the collective, that piece is divided into portions, where the size of each portion is relative to the amount of work a miner has performed, and each miner receives a piece that is proportional in size to how much he has mined relative to all the other miners.
Miners *can* choose to discard gold when they find it, but why would they? If they are providing, say, 5% of the work to the gold mining collective, they miss out on getting 5% of the gold they just found.

In my opinion, it's not necessary that the computer has never been online. There's no way to make sure it hasn't. For me it's sufficient that it doesn't go online after I create the wallet on the device, and that it has a detachable wifi card, so there's no chance it can communicate with the world. There *is* a slight chance it could have a BIOS malware, although they are extremely rare. But I chose to accept this risk. In any case, the OS you install on the device is something you download from the Internet, so the software on it has been in contact with the Internet. The same with the offline Armory version.

The last characters of an address is the checksum. How can this library know that the last 'b' is what was mistyped, and not one of the characters that define the hash160, which results in a checksum that makes the address end in a 'b'?
All the library can know is that the checksum is invalid. It can't know whether the checksum, or the actual data -- from which the checksum is calculated -- is wrong, as far as I can see.

So in order to use client-side web wallets, you open your browser, go into they "Key Management" section (that is a feature of the browser), create a new key.

@_date: 2014-12-03 15:12:53
Exactly. "Bad" money refers to "overvalued" money (by decree).
If the market price of one ounce of gold is 20 ounces of silver, and the government sets the exchange rate to 15 ounces of silver per ounce of gold, then silver (the overvalued money) drives out gold (the undervalued money), because sellers of gold are forced to sell at below market price (1/15th ounce of gold for an ounce of silver instead of 1/20th ounce of gold for an ounce of silver).
Consequently, people stop selling stuff in exchange for gold, and silver becomes dominant.
@_date: 2014-04-27 06:45:18
That depends entirely on what the fees are.
You bootstrap the sidechain by creating enough transactions in that chain for some miner to bother to mine it. It might mean that we don't get a block every 10 minutes, but we'd get a block every time enough transactions have accumulated for someone to want to get the fees.
And this is exactly how it should be: if a side chain doesn't provide so much additional value that people are willing to spend enough money on fees for miners to care mining it, it doesn't provide enough value.
It's exactly the same as with any other service or good: if people aren't willing to pay more for the good or service than it costs to produce, it shouldn't get produced.

The header is a fixed size of 80 bytes, and is enough to verify the work has been done. Pools should note the timestamp at which they receive new block headers, and then subsequently request transactions for the block from the node. That way the size of the new block will not influence the choice of which new block to choose -- because it's the timestamp of receiving the block header that matters.

We **know** that p2pool.org is a valid P2Pool node. That's not the point. We all agree on that. p2pool.org is a mining pool that happens to be connected to the P2Pool network.
What we a differentiating between here is: a) **being a P2Pool node** and b) **mining at a mining pool that happens to be a P2Pool node**.
You don't get the advantage of decentralized mining just because the pool you happen to mine at is connected to the P2Pool network. At any time this pool can -- just like any other pool, but unlike P2Pool -- choose to direct your hashing power to something nefarious.
When you are a P2Pool node yourself, no one can redirect your hashing power to something else: **you** verify all transactions and verify the blocks you mine.

No I don't think it does. I saw it mentioned on the Bitcoin mailing list.
I won't work now, however. Because Bitcoin Qt nodes prefer the *first* transaction they see, that spends an output, not the one with the highest fee. When/if this is changed, it will work - and miners have an incentive to do this, so I think it's inevitable. The ironic thing is that one would think that allowing higher fee transactions, spending the same output, to replace lower fee transactions would make double spending *worse*, but it can actually help eradicate it.

The size of the current work force in the Bitcoin mining sector is not really dependent on how many transactions per second the network handles, it only sets a floor for the quality of the Internet connection to the mining facility. The humans aren't checking the transactions, and the power spent actually verifying transactions is a tiny fraction of the power used for proof-of-work, so the TPS figure has no influence on how many people are needed to maintain a mining farm.

It's definitely possible. It works by the exact same mechanism as compromising a device through a USB or Ethernet connection: through incorrect handling of input data.
Whichever program handles the input (whether it comes from USB, Ethernet of a camera) is the point of failure in such systems. I'm not going to explain how incorrect handling of input data leads to a system compromise, but you can read about it here: 
There is one big difference between a camera and a USB/Ethernet connection though: the camera accepts analog data from the user, that it then samples into digital data, which means there's an extra step involved in feeding malformed digital data packets to the interpreting program.

As far as I can gather, centralized markets mitigate this by putting a price on a review, even if only implicitly: there's always a payment fee associated with buying someone on eBay, for example, so if you fake a review you still get to pay the fee. And Silk Road, as far as I understand, also imposed a fee based on the price of the item, so here reviews weren't free either: a dishonest merchant had to pay to get good reviews (by paying the fee on the sale in question).
The equivalent in a distributed market could be a proof-of-burn associated with every transaction. Here, the money is destroyed instead of going to the market place operator (eBay/Silk Road).

Armory supports "fragmented backups":  (scroll down the page to "Using Fragmented Backups").
This means that you can - for example - make *three* paper backups, where any *two* of them will restore your wallet.
With this you can store one in your safe deposit box, one in your house, and one in a friend's/relative's house.
Anyone who wishes to steal your paper backup would need to break in and steal two of these paper backups, in order to steal your coins.
The bank can't crack open your deposit box and recover your wallet from that paper backup, and neither can your friend/relative without at the same time breaking into your house or your deposit box.

Bear in mind that this figure assumes an arbitrary figure of 10% of all B2C e-commerce transactions. So if it only gets 1%, it's a tenth of that, and if it gets 50% it's 5x that.
I'd take this analysis with a huge grain of salt. But if the 10% figure does hold, I think this analysis might be correct within about an order of magnitude.
I do think it's hard for a medium of exchange to be used for 10% of all e-commerce B2C transactions, without acting as a store of value at all. I don't think that's a realistic scenario. The higher the market share in B2C transactions, the more people will be using it to store value, I think.

This is the reason I think proof-of-burn works better: you can immediately see who can profit from scamming you. If an merchant has burned, say, $1,000 worth of bitcoins in the process of selling for $50,000 worth of items (2% burn fee), you can immediately conclude that he would not benefit from scamming you in a $200 sale. It further requires that you can track any open orders, though, so a seller can't accumulate open orders, from which he runs away with all of the money, and makes a profit.

The only thing we can be sure of is whether a seller can turn a profit by cheating you.
**1.** *Merchant pays 1 BTC to a centralized marketplace, to get his merchant account.*
Now the merchant won't profit from scamming anyone for less than or equal to 1 BTC.
**2.** *Merchant accepts order for 0.2 BTC, 5% of which are paid to the marketplace as a processing fee.*
Now the merchant won't profit from scamming anyone for less than or equal to 1 BTC + 5% * 0.2 BTC = 1.01 BTC
And so on, and so forth.
There is no central party to receive any funds in a decentralized marketplace, the only solution is proof-of-burn. A merchant burns 1 BTC to establish trust, associated with the account creation, to let potential buyers know that it won't profit from scamming them for &lt;= 1 BTC. A merchant should think of it as an investment. Same goes for fees: they are burned.

It's not about hardware, it's about the speed of which the SHA256 hash function was implemented in software. Previous to Bitcoin, there was never a reason to perform a million SHA256 hashes per second.
1 megahash per core is no small feat. For a 3 GHz CPU, that's only 3,000 instructions per double SHA256 hash, and an x86 CPU needs around 4000 instructions to compute a double SHA256. Now, x86 CPUs can execute more than one instruction per clock cycle, but it should be obvious that a naive C implementation could easily require more than 3,000 instructions per double hash.

Think of it like a bank account number. The advantage of a bank account number is two-fold:
1. Anyone can pay you with that number
2. No one else (besides the recipient's and sender's bank) knows you've been paid
With traditional, static Bitcoin addresses, only 1. is fulfilled, because *everyone* knows you've been paid (it's public knowledge).
This scheme creates bank account number-like addresses, so that only the sender and receiver know they've exchanged funds. So it's even better than a bank account number, because there is no recipient and sender bank that gains knowledge of the transaction.

I should clarify. The statement is a bit convoluted. What I mean is that the Federal Reserve (and most other central banks') determination to lend money to commercial banks at 0-0.25% interest is effectively creating an arbitrage between bank-issued bonds that are bought by the Fed (ie. the commercial bank borrowing from the Fed) and market bonds.
If a 5% bond is issued in the market, then a commercial bank can borrow money from the fed, albeit with a short duration, and buy this 5% bond, which means its price sky rockets (and the yield drops).
It's a bit like the state offering to buy a good, let's say potatoes, at a fixed price of $1/lb. If it costs $0.50/lb to produce 1 lb of potatoes, then people will buy all potatoes that cost less than $1/lb and sell to the state, effectively pushing up the price of potatoes to at least $1/lb everywhere. If you replace potatoes with 1-day *x*% interest bonds, this is exactly what the Fed (and every other central bank) is doing: offering to buy short term debt at a fairly high price (thus causing the yield to decline).

Yes it will. 20M iterations of PBKDF2 takes 2 minutes to perform. A single SHA-256 iteration takes less than a millisecond.
Of course, that doesn't make the password "password" that much more secure, (because it's likely the first guess of an attacker), but it stretches the entropy of your password.
For example, choosing a 3-word [diceware]( passphrase, will get you 8000^3 combinations. If each combination takes 2 minutes to guess, it will take, on average, 2 million years to crack. As opposed to less than a year for SHA-256.

One strategy is to, let's say you wanted to invest $1000, buy now for $500. If it halves, buy for $250, if it halves again, buy for $125, and so on. You'll double your number of BTC every time, and even if this is the bottom, you'll have bought $500 worth at the bottom. This way, you never really lose, but you never really win either (buy exactly at the bottom for all your money), but that would be like winning the lottery anyway.

If BFL were honest, they wouldn't claim to be able to ship on a certain date, and certainly not a date that depends on the first sample of chips coming back from the foundry without any errors.
They literally had the very first sample chips coming back from the foundry a month or so before the claimed shipping dates.
What they should have done was refrain from claiming a certain shipping date, and instead say it the way it was: *date of shipping unknown, but no earlier than xx/xx/xx*.

One way would be to send a randomly generated AES key to the person who's supposedly storing your data, have them encrypt your data (serialized in a canonical way) with this key, and send back the hash of this encrypted data. You do the same for your data, and if the hashes match, the other node has your data.
But I still fail to see how we can ensure redundancy (that the data is stored on *separate* drives, at -- preferably -- separate locations).

Or do you get as many private keys as you have receive addresses, but there is a private key which isn't for one of your receive addresses?
I ask since it would be helpful to know when debugging, if the wrong address or private key is generated, or if the private key just isn't saved.

Why on earth would it be that?
If you can effectively pay for items on Amazon with Bitcoin, just as you would any other currency (no leftover gift card balance to spend, no excessive fees), then that is awesome.
If, on the other hand, you want Amazon to *believe* in Bitcoin, and the price to rise because they officially accept it, then no, this does not achieve that. But these are two separate issues.
This is the very point of money, folks. It is liquid. You don't *need* someone to accept bitcoins themselves for bitcoins to be useful as a medium of exchange, as Bitpay and Coinbase have proven.
Anyway, I see payment processors like Bitpay and Coinbase (who exchange bitcoins for fiat currency for their vendors) as a compatibility layer between the Bitcoin protocol and the SWIFT protocol, currently. Compatibility layers are great, because they allow you to use old technology alongside new technology. And I think over time this is a huge positive for bitcoin, not a negative in any way.

I'm not commenting on your basic point, but either I'm misunderstanding you here or you are wrong. A version 1 address is *not* an encoding of the scriptPubKey; it's: (in hex, "|" denotes concatenation)
    address_data_without_checksum = 00 | RIPEMD-160(SHA256(public_key))
    address_data = address_dat_without_checksum | first_4_bytes_of(SHA256(SHA256(address_data_without_checksum)))
    address = base58_encode(address_data)
The heart of the address (the hex160) is the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA256 hash of: the public key encoded in either uncompressed or compressed form. This is the &lt;data&gt; portion of the scriptPubKey template you mention.

Exactly. Going from, for example, 256 bit ECDSA to 512 bit it gets 2^128 times harder to crack a key, but the bandwidth only increases by a factor of 2.
Bitcoin might not be able to scale to very high volume (100k+ TPS) right now, but there is no doubt it will be able to in the future. Conveniently, it will take some time for people to adopt bitcoins, so I don't think we need to have anything to worry about.
10 years ago I had a 1024/128 Kbit/s connection [that cost 395 DKK/month]( Now I have a 35/5 [for 279 DKK/month]( That't a 50x decrease in price of bandwidth (DKK/kbit/s). If we extrapolate that out, 10 years from now I should have a ~2 gbit connection for the same price as my 35/5 mbit connection costs now. In four months from now, I will get a 200/200 mbit connection [for 199 DKK/month]( That's a nice step towards the 2 gbit line in 10 years.
A 2 gbit connection can sustain 250,000 transactions per second. That's 5 times more than VISA's [2013 peak]( of 47,000 TPS.

What are they talking about? This service isn't "non-centralized" -- it's completely centralized: a service that you hope will do what it promises (send cryptocurrency in exchange for receiving cryptocurrency).


An order book exchange might be old news, but so is iron and water, and that doesn't change their importance. "Order book exchanges" aren't going away -- hopefully -- it's the only way to build a decentralized exchange (where each counterparty to the trade is a different node on the network).
I'm not saying it's definitely possible or even easy to create such a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, but shapeshift.io is a traditional, centralized web service, unlike what the article claims.
The innovation of shapeshift.io is the fact that account creation isn't required. This is commendable, a definite step forward, but it doesn't make it decentralized.

It does. Read the article.
In short, when gold is expensive compared to the price of mining it, a lot will be mined and sold on the market, which will suppress the price. Conversely, when gold is cheap, it will increasingly be consumed in industrial applications, for jewelry etc., and thus decrease the supply, which will put an upwards pressure on the price.
Bitcoin doesn't have this mechanism. The Bitcoin supply curve is completely pre-determined, except the variation caused by an increase in network speed, which only increases the rate of creation until all coins are mined, making us reach the point quicker where no more coins are produced.

That doesn't make sense. Bitpay accepts bitcoins. You send bitcoins to them in exchange for an item. You use the Bitcoin network to send bitcoins to Bitpay. They are, by definiton, in the chain. The only way to get around this is having BTC in your Bitpay account, and paying with that. But with that we would lose a lot of the benefits of Bitcoin (like owning your own money, instead of storing them with a third party).

Or even encouraging it. If people could get a decent return on savings, they would invest it, rather than hoard it. The Fed is making sure that you can't get a decent return on USD.
If people hoard instead of invest, it's simply a sign that people think interest rates are too low: people don't want to risk investing money for that low a return.
With hard money (eg. gold), this is how interest rates are set: once the return on investment gets low enough, holders of money no longer want to risk their money for that low a return, and they sell the stock/bond, pushing down the prices of stocks and bonds, and pushing up interest rates. The interest rate is formed by an equilibrium between hoarding and investing, and is a decentralized phenomenon, arrived at by the market as a whole.
With our current monetary system, a group of a few dozen people think really hard about what the interest rate should be, and then that's what it is. If people think this interest rate is too low, they will hoard rather than invest.
With hard money you don't have the problem of people hoarding excessively, because in such a system, the very act of hoarding pushes up interest rates, making hoarding comparatively less attractive.
The interest rate in a hard monetary system acts very much like the price system: people who think a certain good is too expensive will sell the good, causing the price to fall, and people who think a certain good is too cheap will buy the good, causing the price to rise, eventually arriving at a market equilibirum, where the price is set by the market as a whole, rather than a few powerful people.
The problem of excessive hoarding is the exact same problem you would see if you fixed the price of a good, so that it doesn't agree with the market price: if it's too expensive people won't buy it, and if it's too cheap no one will sell it, because they don't feel they are paid enough. Excessive hoarding is simply the Federal Reserve setting a ceiling price on USD bonds, and the market thinking this price is too high.

There's a big difference between what the **protocol requires** vs what the **implementation uses**.
In the case of proof-of-stake (PoS), the protocol cannot function without centralized checkpoints. With Bitcoin, the protocol works fine, it's simply an optional optimization implemented in the Bitcoin Core client. It will probably soon be removed, because "headers first" initial syncing will make it unnecessary.
Proof-of-stake, on the other hand, requires checkpoints on the protocol level, because there is no way to differentiate between a chain that people have been working on for a long time or a completely new chain, that someone just mined, because the *time* aspect is lost.
Think of proof-of-work: if I were to create an alternative Bitcoin block chain with the same amount of work as the current chain, I would have to calculate trillions of hashes: this takes time.
Compare that to proof-of-stake: my mining power is defined by my balance, not any tangible/physical thing like processing power, so I can create a new block chain, assign coins to myself, use those coins to mine more coins for myself, and so on and so forth. There is no "work" in this chain, that enables people to see that this new chain I've just created, is not the one that all the other people use, because it requires no effort to produce it, because it doesn't use proof-of-work, which *does* require work/effort.

According to BitPay themselves, they offer the best available price (with no fees):

OK. Yeah small towns aren't great if you want fast Internet.
It's strange it's not faster in the bigger cities, though. Here in Copenhagen (Denmark), in the area where I live, there are at least three companies with fiber in the ground that I know of. Perhaps it's harder or more expensive to get permission to put fiber in the ground in large Canadian cities?
Once you have fiber somewhere, it's really just a process of getting together enough people to split the cost of digging from the company's fiber ring and over to your apartment complex. This costs around 100,000 DKK for the apartment complex I live in, with around 200 tenants. So that's only 500 DKK per person. And then wiring the apartment complexes, which isn't *that* expensive. Doing all of this the place where I live, we will have saved all the money that we spent on this after around two years, because the price for the actual subscription is like one third of the price of the ADSL providers that we all currently use.

Generally Bitcoin users don't lose their coins in scenarios like these, it's mostly merchants (including exchanges) that are at risk.
For example, on the day of the fork, it was possible to deposit 100 BTC into an exchange, wait 6 confirmations, buy litecoins for these bitcoins and immediately withdraw the litecoins, and then double spend the initial deposit transaction.
Then you could have sold your litecoins for bitcoins on another exchange (or the same exchange if they haven't found out what you're doing), and you'll have -- more or less -- doubled the 100 BTC, essentially taking them from the exchange in question.

You're right that it's better when people mine at smaller pools (like P2Pool node mining pools), because it increases decentralization. 
However, it needs to be clear that it doesn't matter whether a small pool uses P2Pool or is a regular pool, both pose the same risks, and if a single pool of either type accumulates too much hashing power, we face the exact same problems.

As far as I can tell, with 1.3% hashing power you get, on average, 56 blocks per month.
Now, if we put this into this Poisson calculator (56 for "Average rate of success"):  we can calculate the probability of getting less than, say, 80% of that (~45 blocks) in a month (put 45 in the "Poisson random variable (x)" field).
This tells us that the probability of getting less than 80% of the expected number of blocks in a month `P(X &lt; 45)` is 5.8%.
So if you operate at a 20% profit margin (you earn 20% on top of the cost of electricity), there's a 5.8% chance you won't be able to pay your monthly electrical bill, if you have no capital buffer.
The same figure for getting less than 90% of the expected number of blocks (50) in a month is around 19%.
So that means that if a miner is operating at a 10% profit margin, there's a 19% probability that he won't be able to pay the current month's electrical bills (again, if he has no capital buffer).
**TL;DR/Conclusion:** you're right. It seems 1.3% of global hash power isn't sufficient if you're operating at a low (&lt;20% profit margin).

Of course the banks are imposing negative interest rates on demand deposit accounts: a demand deposit account *shouldn't* earn interest, because there is no way for the bank to safely invest the money in that account, unless they want to add risk by mismatching the duration of their assets and liabilities. Without safely being able to invest deposited funds, there is no way to earn a profit on the deposit, and there is no money to pay in interest.
As a bank, if the duration of your assets and liabilities are matched, you only risk a bank run in case the issuers of your assets (bonds) default. In case of asset/liability duration mismatch, you run the risk of a bank run *also* when the interest rate rises, and the value of your bond portfolio decreases.
Now, because of the ECB, the yield on both 1 and 2-year German government bonds is negative. This means that, at least for German banks, you shouldn't necessarily expect to earn interest on even a 2-year time deposit, unless you want your bank to take on extra risk because of asset/liability duration mismatch.

*8% of $7,909: $632.72*
*44% of 445,352 DKK ($82,306): $36,214.64*
*59% of 591,875 DKK ($109,385): $64,537.5055*
**= $101,385 in tax, or 50.7%**
If you earn, say, $30,000 per year, you pay:
*8% of $7,909: $632.72*

The Bitcoin protocol knows about *transactions*, not addresses. The "balance" of an address is simply the sum of the funds in transactions with that address as the destination. So there are hundreds of transactions, each of which output a little bit to OP's address. To send these coins to a new address, he will have to construct a transaction that redeems *all* these transaction outputs, and sends the coins to a new address.

Good question.
The orders you're talking about are called *limit orders*. This is because they set a *limit* price for your order: a *maximum* for bids (buy orders) and *minimum* for asks (sell orders). You're saying you're not willing to sell for less than the limit price (for asks) or buy for more than the limit price (for bids).
Say you send a BUY limit order with a limit price of $1000 (amount: 1 BTC, let's say) to an exchange, and on the order book of this exchange the two lowest asks are 1) **$500 (for 0.5 BTC)** and 2) **$501 (for 1 BTC)**. Your order should eat up the entire lowest ask (0.5 BTC and 0.5 BTC from the next ask (at $501), and you'd pay:
0.5\*500 + 0.5\*501 = $500.5
for 1 BTC.

The free market is fairly good at managing private property, but less good at managing a common good, like the blockchain.
The thing is that one single miner can decide to include a billion transactions in a block, which results in *everyone* having to store this one billion-transaction block. If only the miner who mined a particular block had to store that block, block size limits would be unnecessary. It's the fact that the blockchain is a sort of common good that makes hard limits like these more sensible.

A private key is simply a number between 1 and FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141 (or 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337 if you like base 10 numbers).
Luckily, we have a hash function that outputs numbers roughly in that range: SHA256.
So to generate a private key from a seed, all we need to do is take the SHA256 hash of the seed, and use this number modulus FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141 as the private key.
In order to create a sequence of private keys, we could simply use `SHA256(seed + n)` as the private key, where *n* counts up each time you use a private key/address.
There are more advanced schemes than this, but this is the basics of it.

What's the "old fork"? We have Bitcoin and we have a fork. Forking is an integral part of open source development, but it's expected that you clearly label your fork as a fork, and don't try to pass it off as the original project (that you forked from). Not doing so would be disingenuous, and would seem more like a way to trick people into accepting your fork, rather than having people base their decision on technical and financial merits.
With a fork like this, you are creating a new monetary unit that is not Bitcoin. You are hoping that all the holders of dollars and euros will suddenly remove their bid from Bitcoin, and start bidding on the coins of this fork. I don't see that happening. But again, time will tell.
@_date: 2014-09-04 18:12:24
Fair enough. Can I ask how fast it is, though?
I assume it uses modular addition of the public key to itself for speed, rather than continually creating new private keys and multiplying them with G? Eg.:
    target_hash160_regex = "e6b34.*7e8c"
    init_priv_key = rand_bytes(32)
    init_pubkey = init_priv_key * G
    curr_pubkey = init_pubkey
    n=1
    while True:
        n = n + 1
        curr_pubkey = curr_pubkey + init_pubkey
        if regex_match(target_hash160_regex, RIPEMD160(SHA256(curr_pubkey))):
            break
    final_privkey = n*init_priv_key
    final_pubkey = curr_pubkey

Ripple is not centralized. XRPs are "pre-mined"*, but the Ripple protocol is not dependent on a central server.
*I write "pre-mined" (using quotation marks) because the Ripple protocol does not make use of mining at all, hence why there are no miners to distribute XRPs to.
You can think of Ripple sort of like Bitcoin with miners taken out of the equation, and you only add nodes that you trust. With Bitcoin, you don't need to trust nodes, because the proof-of-work system can *prove* whether the majority agrees on something. With Ripple, you have to trust nodes to a certain degree, because there is no way to know whether what some node is saying is agreed on by the rest of the network. This has advantages and disadvantages. A disadvantage is the fact that nodes can collude more easily to fool you, an advantage is that no energy is expanded on mining, and that transactions confirm almost instantly.

Depends on how you encode it. A compressed public key can be as small as the private key (in crypto-systems like Ed25519 it is encoded to 32 bytes, which is the same size of a private key), and in Bitcoin a compressed public key is usually encoded using 33 bytes.

Consider everyone's good friend: the arbitrage bot.
Scenario: someone wants to sell 1000 BTC on Bitstamp (because that's the only exchange he has an account with). If there were no arbitrage bots, what would happen is that he would be selling into Bitstamps order book only, causing a large price decrease on Bitstamp. What happens when there are arbitrage bots is that first he will sell 10 BTC, causing the price to drop a bit on Bitstamp, and then wait for arbitrage bots to buy cheap bitcoins on Bitstamp and sell them on other exchanges, causing the price to increase in Bitstamp again. This will continue until he has sold all his bitcoins.
Without arbitrage bots, the price would just keep falling on Bitstamp, but the arbitrage bots effectively spread this guys large sell order across other exchanges, causing a smaller overall decline in price.
TL;DR: Arbitrage bots increase price stability by effectively spreading single, large orders on one exchange out over several other exchanges.

This is true for hard money (like gold and bitcoin), but not necessarily for dollars (and euros). When people hoard money, they push up the price of money, which is the same as saying they're pushing down the price of goods and services.
But if the price of goods and services drop (what is usually called "(price) deflation"), the Federal Reserve will just produce more money -- the first recipients of which are banks -- to make sure prices don't drop. And in this case, no one benefit from decreasing prices, because the Fed is fighting tooth and nail, to make sure it doesn't happen.

You are of course welcome to do this. Bitcoin is open source, after all.
But at the end of the day, I think people would consider this fork an altcoin, and not Bitcoin. Just because your fork only differs from Bitcoin with regards to the block size limit doesn't mean it's "similar enough" to be considered as the real Bitcoin. As soon as a too-big-for-regular-Bitcoin block is included in your fork, the two chains will have diverged, and your fork will be as much Bitcoin as as Litecoin is. Or at least that's what I think will happen.
Two truths about who owns what bitcoins does not work. It renders the entire concept useless. Therefore I dont think most people will join your fork. But we will see, I guess.

Exactly. We have fairly good measures to protect against 0-confirmation double spends.
Example: when you pay $1 for an ice cream from a trusted vendor (eg. 7-Eleven, local grocery store), you actually send $2 worth of bitcoins to the vendor. You get your ice cream and walk away. If the paying transaction makes it into the blockchain, the vendor pays you back the extra $1. If this *does not* happen, and you try to double spend the $2 transaction back to yourself, the vendor creates a transaction that spends all your $2 as a miners' fee. All miners will be incentivized to include this transaction into the blockchain, instead of the double spend, because they make $2 in fees on it. So the buyer has no financial incentive to try to cheat the ice cream vendor, or he'll pay twice as much for his ice cream.

Decentralization is not the ultimate goal, we are much better off finding a balance between decentralization and centralization, because decentralization is expensive. This is evidenced by the high transaction fees that a low block limit-Bitcoin would require, as you write in your comment.
Some people may be willing to pay a high price for decentralization (like yourself), others may not. Ultimately, the market will decide which route to take, and if people disagree, Bitcoin can be forked. Then, the market again can decide whether it wants two forms of decentralized digital money: highly decentralized, but high transaction fee-Bitcoin (probably named something else, unless Gavin agrees this is the way) or a less decentralized, but low transaction fee-Bitcoin.
Traders of these two currencies will try to assess the risk of both currencies, and will price them according to this, meaning that if the market in general agrees that decentralization is of high importance, the highly decentralized version of Bitcoin will be of higher value than it's less decentralized counterpart.

I disagree with him on this point. If changes become necessary, they *will* happen, if they aren't strictly necessary, they might happen (which is how it should be).
The difference between bitcoin and IPv4 vs IPv6 is that the latter often requires hardware changes, and not just changes in software. The IP protocol is a low level protocol, compared to the Bitcoin protocol which operates on top of TCP/IP (which makes Bitcoin an application layer protocol). It's usually a lot easier to change high level protocols than low level ones.

The reason it's a pain in the ass is because of two things:
* Anti-money laundering (AML) laws and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations
* The irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions
With regards to AML and KYC, this is what makes it illegal for an exchange to sell crypto currency for national currency (USD, EUR, etc.), without knowing the identity and current residence of the customer. This means that all (legally operating) exchanges must go through a time-consuming and expensive process of manually verifying ID and proof-of-residence documents for all their new clients, unless they want to risk being charged with aiding money laundering. This means that it often takes a while to be able to buy bitcoins on an exchange after registering.
The second reason, the irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions, means that it's dangerous for a bitcoin seller to accept reversible payments, like PayPal, credit card or debit cards. If they did, they would risk the customer buying bitcoins, withdrawing them to their wallet, and claiming that they never received anything, get their money back, and so get free bitcoins. This basically forces exchanges to only accept non-reversible money transfers, like wire transfers.
Wire transfers are expensive, and many exchanges are limited as to how many wire transfers they can accept in a given amount of time. This causes some exchanges to impose minimum limits on the wire transfers.
I'd say the best bet for newcomers is [localbitcoins.com]( Here you are interacting with individuals, who are not bound by the AML and KYC laws (or at least they don't follow it). The disadvantage is that you interact with real people, whose track record is harder to establish.
Where are you located? My impression is that Coinbase is the preferred source of bitcoins for USD if you live in the US. There are other sites for Europeans, but it depends on where you are exactly.

No. The USD monetary base is a liability of the Federal Reserve. Look at their balance sheet: 
Under liabilities is listed "Federal Reserve notes in circulation" (physical cash) and "deposits held by depository institutions" (banks' money deposited with the Federal Reserve).
Now, it's defaulted debt, which means it's non-redeemable. US creditors were defaulted on in 1933 and international creditors were defaulted on in 1971.

I used to be for an increase in the block size. But I have to admit, after learning about routed clearing networks (eg. Amiko-pay and Lightning Network) that work on top of Bitcoin, I'm much less inclined to support an increase in block size. Bryan's comment highlights exactly this: we can scale Bitcoin by building on top of it, but we need the foundation that is the Bitcoin blockchain to be secure and decentralized, in order for this to work. If we lose that, we lose everything, including the stuff built on top.
In other words: building on top of a solid foundation of a decentralized blockchain can solve scalability problems. But if we start altering the foundation, we might find that it becomes too brittle (centralized) to act as a solid foundation, and we lose *everything* -- both the foundation, and what's built on top of it.

The question is not whether it's possible, but whether it's profitable.

Right. But I think the point is that the market process will eliminate the bad players after a while. In the beginning, it will be difficult to know whom to trust. But after a while you can see who has a history, and would profit the least from running off with your money (as it would put an end to an otherwise profitable business).
It's also possible to use several arbiters. Increases the cost, of course, but also decreases the risk. Perhaps this would be most relevant for new sellers/arbiters. Using three arbiters means either the buyer or seller would have to control two out of the three chosen arbiters, in order for a scam to work.

For future reference, here's how you properly configure a Tor hidden service: 
TL;DR: Create two VMs: one that is connected to the Internet and runs Tor, where Tor listens for connections on a virtual network interface, let's say with IP address 10.0.0.1. On the second VM, which will run the web server, configure its network interface to be in bridge mode with the virtual interface on the first VM (10.0.0.1). Now an attacker needs to be able to break out of the second VM, in order to discover the real IP address.

AMD graphics cards are advertised as supporting OpenCL (which is the API we use to write miners for GPUs). If the OEM that produces your card has a clause that says the warranty does not cover using the card for extensive OpenCL calculations (which I'm pretty sure they *do not* have), you might have a problem. Otherwise, you should be good.

If you know a simpler solution to transaction ID malleability, please share it with us. Fixing that will do much more for scalability than doubling the block size. I've read the SegWit BIP specs, and as far as I can see, it's the simplest solution to the txid malleability issue. 
We need signature data out of the transaction, or else we would need to change what a transaction hash is. And adding a special case-script has been tried before (with P2SH), and works. 
I think they should have left out any changes to the block size, however. It's a shame if this prevents SegWit adoption, since it's a needed technical fix.

Or, more relevantly, why is that a problem for anyone but the people who make the error of equating the ability to trade a particular crypto currency with an endorsement?
Sure, the people who make this mistake have a problem. But I don't see why it should be the job of exchanges to not support a certain crypto cyrrency, because some traders might view this as an endorsement. Those traders make an error -- conflating the ability to trade a crypto currency with a seal of approval. But I don't see why an exchange has a responsibility to limit the choices of all its users, because some of them make this error.

None. The input script (also called the scriptSig) pushes some values onto the stack. This stack is inherited by the output script (also called the scriptPubKey).

I believe the key here is that when setting up a micropayment channel, you lock up some funds, which allows you to make instant transfers using the locked up coins as a source of funds.
Since the coins are locked up, you cannot double spend them. So the recipient of the micropayment knows the transaction is good, and the money will be transferred to him when he broadcasts the transaction.
This is good for doing quick, successive transactions. But seemingly it can also be used to do a single, lump sum transaction that is instant, because the transaction's source of funds are locked up, and cannot be moved.
The traditional way of double spending is funding an address B using address A, and then sending a conflicting transaction that sends funds from A to C instead. The owner of the address B will think he's received the funds, because he has a valid transaction sending funds from A-&gt;B. But because the address A doesn't lock up the funds, this allows the owner of address A to create a new transaction, that pays to address C instead, leaving the owner of address B without anything. Payment channels prevent this by locking up the source funds.

Perhaps they could make a test where people can pre-order Trezors for, say, $49 per device, and if the total number of pre-ordered devices gets to, say, 10,000 units, all who have ordered get one for $49.
That would generate a revenue of $490,000, with a profit of $300,000 if we exclude hardware costs, to be used to pay developer and customer service salaries.
Of course, these numbers are just examples. They could set any price, and minimum order quantity, as long as they remember to inform customers that the pre-order will only go through if *X* number of units are ordered in total.

Then we'd ruin Bitcoin completely, also for the people who didn't get their bitcoins stolen. This is why theft of national currencies (USD, EUR, DKK, etc.) cannot be claimed legally by their original owner. It would ruin fungibility, which would ruin the money itself.
This is the reason that money is one of the few exceptions to the rule that one who does not lawfully own something (ie. the person stole it), cannot pass ownership onto someone else. It's about preserving fungibility. One unit of money must not differ in quality from another, or it will not work as money. See here:

That is true. The quicker the price moves, the quicker the defaults happen.

With these wild price moves, a lot of miners are bound to stop mining, unless they are not in it for the profit, which -- I would guess -- the majority of the network is.

This is the answer, OP.
.torrent files were really only useful back when they included a lot of redundant information -- the hashes of all data pieces of the torrent. Now, you just have a root hash, and you retrieve all the data piece hashes from other nodes after you've connected to them, and you can check that they are valid using the root hash.
So we use URIs now, for torrents as well, because we only need a small amount of information: 1) info hash and 2) name and perhaps 3) a tracker, like:

IBM can simply offer *x* number of BTCs for a valid block.
Or, better yet, create a consortium (like [Khronos]( or the [Open Handset Alliance]( and dedicate a certain amount of member funds to pay miners for valid blocks.
So, mining would be distributed (the one with the most efficient miner can mine the most blocks, and make the most money), but the source of funds would come from investors, and not be issued by the network itself.
For preventing denial-of-service attacks on this new blockchain, you could require that all transactions do a proof-of-burn of a certain number of bitcoins (say, 0.0005 or $0.10) and includes this proof in the transaction. Or you could just pay a fee to the consortium. This would prevent spammers from filling up the blockchain.

Sure there is: asset/liability duration matching.
A bank that has its assets and liabilities matched in duration is more robust than a bank who does not practice this. The former will have no problems in times of volatile interest rates, while the latter will be pulled in and out of insolvency as rates rise and fall.
Insolvent banks increase the risk of bank runs -- as a depositor, who wants to be left holding the bag if you can get out now? Sure, you can partly pave over this problem using mandatory deposit insurance, but you're not really solving the root problem of insolvent banks, just suppressing a symptom: bank runs.
Ultimately, I think it should be up to the consumer which bank he wants to deposit his funds with. Whether it be one that practices asset/liability duration matching or not. But there are advantages to choosing the former.

So the opinions of the users are heard, by observing which blockchain they choose. Of course, you're right, it'd be nice to know this *in advance*, and not *after* miners have switched consensus rules.

I disagree. Here's an excerpt from their wiki:


In other words, it's an arbitrage. And the day that traders don't expect BitUSD to be worth one dollar, it all falls to the ground. Pegging is not possible unless you have investors willing to invest capital. If I sell thousands of BitUSD, there *must* be someone there to pick up my selloff, and there will be as long as they believe they can make money from it.
When they stop believing that, there will be no one to pick up the selloffs, and the positive reinforcement in this scheme becomes a negative one (one selloff causing another, because the price of one BitUSD is falling below one dollar (ie. "get out while you can")).

I think that these two situations are so different that they each deserve their own word, so we don't make the error of mistaking one for the other.
I realize both are referred to as "censorship", but my point is that it would be better to call "self-censorship" something else, so as to not conflate these two very different situations.

This is not true. Bitcoin is more than cheap transaction fees (it's trustless, for example).
Also, in many countries, bank transfers to domestic banks are free, and sometimes instant (here in Denmark, transfers up to 10,000 DKK (~1,500 USD) are free and instant). As I understand it, this is the case in the UK as well.
This would be ideal for countries like these, although volume would be low for small countries, but I'm sure arbitrageurs would bridge the gap between a local Coinffeine exchange, and exchanges like Bitfinex and Bitstamp, and make some money doing that.

Anyone with a fundamental understanding of the Bitcoin protocol can create a valid block full of spammish transactions. Without a block size limit, these huge blocks can become embedded in the blockchain, and you are exposing Bitcoin to a huge denial-of-service attack.
I'm not saying we need to keep the 1 MB limit forever, or even that 1 MB is the right limit. I'm just saying that:
1. We do not have an incentive to increase the block size more than is absolutely necessary (going from 1 to 5 MB to begin with makes more sense to me)
2. I don't think completely removing the limit is a viable option

Please don't quote GATA. They have very little proof of their claims, and the market data doesn't support their theory of central banks naked short selling gold futures (ie. we see no or very little backwardation): 


It may not make you richer, but it will protect you from bank insolvencies, which will start occurring when interest rates rise, and the bonds that the bank used your deposit to purchase halves in price (like happened in Cyprus after Greek government bond haircuts).


I agree. The decentralized nature of individuals holding gold coins privately, versus storing them in the same warehouse and just holding IOUs, means the former is more resilient -- no central point of failure (the warehouse where all the gold is stored).

Please explain the process by which Bitstamp would lower the bitcoin price.
The only way they can do it is by dumping "fake" bitcoins on buyers on their platform, causing the Bitstamp bid to decrease. That would *increase* the degree of their insolvency, not decrease it (because they are now ~19000 BTC short *plus* the fake bitcoins they just sold).
They would be diving further under water in order to get to the surface. There'd be a lot less risk just finding someone they can buy 19,000 BTC from at the current market price, rather than speculating with 19,000 BTC.

1. It's very simple to control the supply of a crypto-currency: make it centralized, and have someone adjust the supply (ie. literally reduce the amount available to each address that holds coins). It's a lot harder (I'd say impossible) to adjust supply for a decentralized crypto-currency. Clients would need to vote on how much to reduce supply, and that can be gamed. The relevant attack would be a rogue client, amassing a lot of voting power, and voting the maximum number of extra currency units into existence, and selling his holdings (now increased in size) on an exchange before other traders act on it (before the price has adjusted). Then he waits until the market has adjusted to this increase in supply, and buys his coins back, cheaper, and he repeats the cycle, slowly removing capital from the system.
2. So, the ability to control supply does not ensure that the price of the currency stays constant. Price is not determined solely from stock/supply. You cannot regulate value into existence. Owners of real capital must be willing to supply it into currency, in order to maintain its value (ie. bid on the currency in question using USD, EUR, gold, real estate, land, steel, etc.). That's the only way something can keep its value: if people are willing to trade valuable things in exchange for it.

I'd say it's about latency.
10 ms of rotational HDD latency means it takes 10 ms every time you want to read a different file. Every time you say "read that file" to the computer, it takes 10 ms before it starts reading anything.
So, reading one thousand 1MB files with 10 ms latency at 100 MB/s read speed takes: (1000*0.01s) + (1000*1MB / 100 MB/s) = 20 seconds, which is an average of 50 MB/s. And doing the same with a latency of 0.1 ms (SSD latency), same read speed, takes: (1,000*0.0001s) + (1000*1MB / 100 MB/s) = 10.1 seconds, or 99 MB/s.
So just changing the latency makes a huge difference the smaller the files are, and the more files you are reading.

If you deposit your bitcoins in a demand deposit account (meaning you can withdraw the coins at any moment), you should expect to pay a storage fee (since the depository institution can't invest your coins without incurring interest rate risk).
But if you are willing to lend out your bitcoins for a year, and consequently deposit them in a 1-year time deposit account, then it makes sense that a part of these funds are lent out -- although proof-of-reserves is also useful in this case, for the bank to prove their reserve ratio (how large a percentage of your bitcoins is the bank lending out?).
You can't expect to earn a yield on your bitcoins unless they are lent out, and I expect people will want this. Also, no money can thrive without a credit market. Perhaps it's even possible, using some elaborate Bitcoin script, to prove that all n-year time deposit funds are only used to finance &lt;=n-year bonds. So that the depositor knows if the duration of the bank's assets and liabilities are matched, in order to not risk going insolvent because of a change in interest rates.

You can't do this without filling the asks and/or bids of legitimate buyers, who have their limit order on the order book. The price can't go to $120 if there are bids on the book above that price.

This doesn't make sense. There is a buffer of transactions, right now, called the mempool, and miners pick the 1MB of transactions with greatest fee per byte to include in a block -- to maximize profit, as you say.
If you look at the mempool, it should be clear that there is so much competition to get into blocks that miners will make more on fees by including more transactions from it. We're talking a backlog of more than 100,000 transactions. Average transaction fee will decrease, of course, but miners will make more per block. If the mempool were empty-ish, I would agree, but it's stock full and then some.

So, to give a clear answer to your question, the economic incentive for the collector is to produce valid blocks, because otherwise he won't earn back the money he pays the miners. The P2P network between the collectors and the SPV clients will keep the collectors honest and lite clients safe, just as the P2P network does with the miners now. 
Someone could easily come along right now, and offer miners 20 BTC for a valid block. So I don't think the fact that collectors *could* have invalid blocks produced is a problem, simply because if we assume that miners are greedy, this is already perfectly possible.
@_date: 2017-01-20 05:02:11
They can't refund BTC because they convert to USD immediately (or hedge), because they need to pay their suppliers in USD, and they can't know which price to charge you in BTC unless they sell (or hedge) immediately for USD.
They could, however, refund you the USD to your credit card. But this involves more work on their part. I expect we will see this when there is more competition in the space for accepting Bitcoin payments, so companies can't get off with just implementing the bare minimal.
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:14:17
I don't see how the proposal changes anything with regards to lite/SPV clients.
Currently, miners are responsible for:
1. Finding a proof-of-work solution
2. Verifying all the transactions that the Merkle root points to
This solution simply splits up this task, such that a second party takes care of **2.**. The safety of this is exactly the same as before, because the only difference is that the *collector* loses his reward if his blocks are invalid, rather than the miner who produced the proof-of-work solution.
To be clear, I'm not suggesting that all full nodes act as collectors. Only those that can keep making a profit on it (because they're better than the miners) will survive. And it may even be the case that the Bitcoin P2P network is so efficient that miners have no trouble finding all high-fee transactions. But the only way to know whether this really is the case is to allow a separate group to make money off of collecting transactions, without simultaneously requiring them to have millions of dollars worth of mining hardware.
Perhaps you could elaborate on how you see this proposal degrading lite client security?
**EDIT:** Also, this proposal simply permits the separation of hashing and tx verification to function in a decentralized manner. It's already perfectly possible for miners to outsource tx verification to someone else. This proposal just enables it in a P2P setting, rather than a trusted, two-party deal between a miner and a tx collector/verifier.

The transaction from the collector contains an output with a block header inside it, and this output pays to an input that can provide the same header, but with the timestamp and nonce field changed so the hash is within the difficulty requirements (and the timestamp is within network time). This is achieved with a new script opcode, which takes as an argument a header with all the fields filled out, but with the nonce and timestamp field set to zero. A miner can then mine on this header and, when it finds a solution, publish a transaction with an input that contains the header, which redeems the output from the collector transaction. This transaction is a completely regular Bitcoin transaction, except that it contains a special output, so it's verified as per usual.

Put in perspective: when a 16.64% increase happens, the difficulty period will only have lasted 12 days. If this goes on for an entire year, the difficulty will increase `365 days / 12 days = 30.4` times by 16.64%, which amounts to `116.64%^30.4 = 10.770%`, or 100x over a year.

Correct. It would take 2^159 (billions of billions of billions of billions of billions) attempts for each address. Also, if it were possible, you would be able to steal everyone's coins by vanitygen'ing their address.
For the address `1YouCanDoThingsFewPeop1eCan1G6NPV` only `YouCanDoThingsFewPeop1eCan` is actually in the blockchain. Both the prepended `1` (the version byte) and `1G6NPV` (the checksum) are added when displaying, by the wallet software or blockchain.info.

A properly run exchange will execute an order by locking the order book and matching against any limit orders in the book. If someone executes an order, and you can avoid having your in-the-book order filled by cancelling it after this point in time, something is wrong with the matching engine on that exchange. Go somewhere else.

If a block doesn't include any transactions the miner misses out on fees, but it still adds to the total proof-of-work for the chain, and thus the security of the chain as a whole.
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:18:47


If a new block is found in the meantime, the miner will have to get a new block header to work on, of course. Just as he needs to do now.


The point of this proposal is that it allows miners to collect the reward regardless of whether the entire block (the transactions it contains) is valid. Only the header needs to be valid, and if the block is also valid then the collector can use the valid header to publish the block and collect the reward. So, of course, collectors will want to make sure that their blocks are valid, but miners don't need to trust anyone.

Because non-tangible stuff can have value, too?
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:10:39
Fair enough. Perhaps locking the entire book is excessive.
My point was that if an order arrives that matches yours in the order book, a trade happens. Of course, you can pull your order from the book at any time provided it hasn't been matched with an incoming order before that. 
If you have an order in the book you're putting capital at risk (if the market moves against you). That's why many exchanges have separate liquidity provider/taker fees: because they realize the value of a deep order book.
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:11:06
So basically, this is about adding a new opcode to Bitcoin script, which allows miners to be paid for a valid proof-of-work header inside a regular Bitcoin transaction. This means that a different group can now act as collectors of transactions, and be the ones who verify transactions and construct new blocks. 
So let's say some well-connected node has found 2000 transactions that pay 1 BTC in fees in total, such that when put inside a block it would pay 13.5 BTC to the coinbase tx. This node now constructs a new Bitcoin transaction, which redeems at least 13.5 BTC from somewhere, and which sends, say, 13.4 BTC to an output which can be redeemed by providing valid proof-of-work for the block he just constructed. So the node will take the block header of the 2000-tx block, set the nonce and timestamp to zero (because the miner needs to be able to change these), and include this in a OP_VALID_POW output.
Miners will listen for these transactions, pick whichever pays the most for a valid header, and mine on that header data. When it finds a solution it will publish a Bitcoin transaction that redeems the OP_VALID_POW output, by providing the POW solution it has found. The node that originally constructed the block will see this transaction, take out the header, replace the previously constructed block's header with this one, and publish the new block, thus earning 0.1 BTC for its efforts (13.5 BTC minus 13.4 BTC)
We need a new opcode because miners need to be sure that they are paid as long as they find a valid POW solution. The nodes that construct new blocks will make sure that these blocks are indeed valid, because otherwise they would pay the miner for a POW solution without being able to use the solution to publish a new, valid block.

No, an Armory wallet is not a list of keys. It's a "starting point", so to speak. When you give the Armory client this starting point then every key it generates from this point will be the same, as long as it uses the same starting point. This means that you can back up your Armory wallet and that backup will stay valid even after you've created 1000 new addresses. As opposed to the Satoshi client where you only back up 100 future keys when you make a backup (and the more keys you have in the wallet the larger the wallet is).

I use Mt. Gox. Mainly because they are the most widely used and thus most liquid exchange, so I assume I can get the cheapest coins there (though I haven't tried to verify this assumption).
If you plan to buy large amounts (more than $100 worth) of bitcoins at a time, the size of the exchange is important in determining the price you can buy your bitcoins for.
If you're not going to be buying bitcoins for large amounts of dollars, the most important thing, I'd say, is how easy it is for you to get fiat currency (dollars, euros, etc.) in and out of the exchange. I've also heard of Mt. Gox suddenly requiring you to get verified in order to withdraw fiat, without requiring identification in order to deposit! I'm not sure what the requirements are for other exchanges. I've only tried depositing euros to Mt. Gox with a SEPA transfer, and that required me to get verified (scanning my passport and sending it to them).

Less than four years of operation does not prove that something functions as a long-term store of value. Gold has functioned as a store of value for literally thousands of years. Bitcoin can't compete with that yet. I mean, would you really save up for retirement in bitcoins? I certainly wouldn't; I'd use gold for that.
I agree with OP: gold for long-term store of value, bitcoins for exchange. They complement each other beautifully.

It's taught in every economics class in almost every school around the world. I think that's part of the reason. Keynesian economics has become the 'truth' when it comes to economics. Imagine if all psychology classes only taught the teachings of Freud, and presented the information as factually correct as Newton's law of motion. That would lead to some pretty messed up views on pshycology by people who take psychology classes, and are unable to understand that what they learn in school isn't necessarily the truth. This is what is the case with economics. One theorist has been picked out and his theories have been raised to independently verified "truths", instead of just one of the many hypotheses that exist on the subject.

As I said, this is why futures trade will have to happen via a clearing house. The clearing house makes sure that all customers have sufficient funds in their account to cover their obligations. As soon as they don't, forced liquidation will take place.
Bitcoinica did this. They allowed leveraged trading, which *is* an obligation, analogous - in that sense - to futures contracts. As soon as the BTCUSD price rose/dropped so much that a person could no longer cover his posititon (or, actually, somewhat before then) his position was closed forcefully, to make sure Bitcoinica and the other customers got their money.

You deliver your own counter-argument right there. Gold mining started out as relatively accessible to anyone (as Bitcoin mining did).

IMO choosing Bitcoin as a national currency is meaningless. Declaring a nation's currency to be a fiat currency makes very much sense.

The jury is still out on that, as far as I can gather.
Some say that the GPU operating at higher temperatures will "wear it down" so to speak. Others say that it's the power cycles (turning the computer on and off) that causes the wear. There is probably some truth to both. As far as I know, no conclusive studies have been performed.

How, exactly, would Mt. Gox be breaking the law by selling bitcoins they don't own? I'm fairly sure you won't find a law that prohibits this. If Mt. Gox only lowers their reserve ratio to the extent that everyone is able to withdraw the bitcoins they have bought, I can't see how Mt. Gox is breaking the law. They're delivering the service they promise.
Mt. Gox *can*, if they wish, sell bitcoins to people without holding the actual bitcoins. It would work somewhat like fractional reserve banking (thus causing a downward pressure on the price of bitcoins), and causing Mt. Gox a huge headache if people tried to withdraw all their coins from their account only to find out that it isn't possible.
In any case, we can find out if Mt. Gox is doing this by coordinating a simultaneous withdrawal of all bitcoins from our accounts. If some are unable to withdraw, something fishy might be up.

This could be linked to an insurer which guarantees holdings on a certain exchange (given that the exchange has gotten the thumbs up from the security firm).

I agree that increased competition in the bitcoin exchange market would be beneficial, but all in all it seems a decentralized exchange has too many disadvantages to make it really useful, or even successful. It's definitely a neat concept though. And wrt. to decentralized currencies (and the exchange between these) it will probably become the standard, as centralized exchanges are no longer needed when the traded currencies are decentralized.

You shouldn't. You have no need to.

I have. It works perfectly. You need more setting up though, as it requires maintaining a block chain (running bitcoind) because you are responsible for which transactions get included in your blocks, and you need to maintain a block chain to know which transactions are good. But the uptime is unsurpassed. It's peer-to-peer, so it's basically only when the protocol is updated that you also have to upgrade the p2pool program in order to stay up. But this upgrade process can be automated fairly easily with a script.

I concur. How will a distributed exchange handle our respective government currencies? If we need to wire money every time we make a transaction, it might get too expensive, and I can't see how we can avoid that since a centralized currency can't be stored in a decentralized manner.

If this is implemented properly, this could be *exactly* what Bitcoin has been longing for ever since wallet thefts started happening: complete protection from malware; wallet only compromisable by actual physical theft of the card.
Now get this card into the hands of some hardware hackers, and see if they can break it. Preferably, put a bounty on it (I'd participate in funding). We need it scrutinized heavily. The only thing worse than *not* having a card that can actually accomplish the above, is having a card that *claims* it can accomplish the above, and have someone compromise it, and the funds of thousands of Bitcoin users who trusted the card are gone.

In any case, if a hacker gets the plain text of the HTTP request, he would be able to authenticate with LR for up to an hour - without knowing the secret key - depending on when he intercepts it (if he is able to guess the "API Name") which, as far as I can tell, isn't supposed to be that secret/hard to guess.

Well that's the thing. You can't own a private key. The private key is a number. Property law does not cover numbers. If you put your Bitcoin paper slip (with the private key on it) on your table and someone reads the private key through a window, they've effectively "stolen" your bitcoins. You still have ownership of the paper slip with the number on it, but your bitcoins are gone. That's what I see as problematic when confusing ownership of a paper slip with the ownership of bitcoins.

I think there is so much uncertainty in the market that I'm not willing to invest any money in it. If you do, be prepared to lose your investment (or have it reduced to nothing).
Last year I invested in a small computer that heats my parents' shed using its two ATI graphics cards. If Butterfly Labs come through with their promise of a ultra cheap ASIC-based mining product, that investment will be rendered nearly worhtless in less than a year. That's how fast things are changing.


The only difference between mining solo and in a pool is payout variance. Ie. you will make the same amount of bitcoins on average (less pool fees) but with solo mining you might not make anything for an entire year, or you might earn three times the average one year, and then nothing the next year. I recommend p2pool. Though it's a bit harder to set up, it offers more resilience than centralised pools (like Deepbit etc.) and it doesn't charge any fees. It does, however, require that you run a Bitcoin node on the mining machine, so a hard drive of some sort is required.

Also, it's important to note that an attacker doesn't know the public key whose corresponding private key can redeem a transaction, until someone tries to redeem the transaction in question.
Most Bitcoin transactions are sent to addresses, an address being a *hash* of a public key. So in order for an attacker to find the private key that can redeem a transaction, he'd first have to get the public key. If calculation of the private key when in possession of the public key is instantaneous with a quantum computer, the attacker can just look for public keys in new transactions being broadcast, find its corresponding private key with his quantum computer, and publish a new transaction that sends the funds to himself, and hope a miner includes his transaction instead of the original one. If, however, finding the corresponding private key isn't instantaneous, the attacker will have to find the public key from a hash, which would't be accelerated with a quantum computer, and so the attacker wouldn't benefit from have a quantum computer.

Why would anyone lend out money if they only got back the principal? That would mean they would risk losing their money to a bad debtor, when they could just let the money sit safely somewhere, unused.
Interest rate is primarily determined by what is called "time preference". It's a measure of how one values futures goods versus present goods. If I value present goods much more than future goods then I will be willing to pay high interest on the money I borrow, because this will allow me to consume now, rather than later. And if I were to lend out money, I'd demand a high interest rate because it would mean I would lose out on present consumption. If, on the other hand, I valued present consumption only slightly more than future consumption, I wouldn't be willing to pay a high interest rate, because I wouldn't mind waiting the time it takes to earn the money. And at the same time, if I had an excess of money I'd be willing to lend them out at a lower interest rate, because I would be okay with not being able to spend the money right now.
Of course one has to add the risk of default, inflation risk, etc. on top of this basic "time preference" rate.

With regards to the BTC-E hack; whether the hacker(s) would have to send requests to the Liberty Reserve server in order to brute force the key, or whether they could do it locally, depends on what information they had obtained.
The HTTP request sent to Liberty Reserve,  to authenticate via the API, contains a SHA-256 hash of the current time (year, month, day, hour) added together with their secret key. If they were able to intercept this HTTP request somehow (and decrypt it if it was HTTPS), they'd have all the data needed to brute-force it locally. They would know the time they intercepted the request and all they'd need to do would be to keep iterating the key and hashing that data until the hash matches the hash in the request they intercepted.

So you're saying that "mathematically impossible" basically means "practically impossible"? You don't have to shut down all computers to prevent someone from sending and receiving bitcoins - only the computers that this person has access to.
I still think he misrepresents Bitcoin when he says (at 15:10) that "with Bitcoin you don't have to trust anyone other than the rules of mathematics". That's not true. We have to trust that the majority of miners are honest; that's a hard dependency of Bitcoin. I think all the developers would agree that this is indeed an experimental currency.
I guess I'm just saying that *if* a flaw is found in Bitcoin, it's really shitty to have proclaimed that it was an impossibility for it to fail. It would hinder the adoption of future crypto-currencies. I guess I don't think we're attracting that many people by claiming it's impossible for it to fail. Experience is what makes people trust things, not promises - I think. People just need to see Bitcoin functioning for a decade or so and I think, by that time, we don't have to make any claims about the robustness of the technology; its proven resilience will have taken care of that by itself.

True. But I think in cases like these, there are just too many variables for us to figure out if it will work or not.
On the other hand, if you're able to write a complete specification, getting someone to write the code shouldn't be too hard. The hard part is figuring out all the little details that appear when you, or someone else, start writing the code. I imagine this is what took Satoshi two years to write the Bitcoin code. It could probably be done in a few months right now, if one is familiar with the technology.


Wrt. to the discussion on block size, I'm thinking what will happen - perhaps it even *has* to happen - is that a fork of Bitcoin is created where the block size limit is the opposite of whatever Bitcoin decides to use. This will be merge mined with Bitcoin, and can be traded freely in exchange for Bitcoins. Whatever system proves to be the most stable will win.
I'm thinking a block size limit might be a good idea, but I'm not sure at all. If we consider the situation where the original Bitcoin removes the limit, and the fork has a 1 MB limit, it would be interesting to see what would happen if advocates of the block size-limited Bitcoin started spamming the blockchain of the limitless implementation. Would the limitless implementation survive? Or would people start moving to the limited version? Would be an interesting experiment in any case.

The ideas may be good, but that doesn't mean that it's possible to implement or even something that people would want to use. One thing that seems obvious to me is that if I can only buy bitcoins from friends' and their friends (which is what the p2p system you suggest says) then I probably won't get as good a price as I can get on Mt. Gox. So in that case why would I use it?
So another explanation for the fact that these systems aren't being worked on is perhaps it's too early at this stage. The demand might just not be there, or there are some non-trivial implementation details that need to be worked out first.

But this won't be possible if the client checks the hashes of the transactions and the blocks. As soon as you modify a transaction, it's hash will be different, and result in a different Merkle root for the block, which will produce a different block hash.

Bear in mind that the security of online wallets doesn't need to only surpass the security of a single user's private wallet, it needs to be greater in proportion to how much more an attacker can gain from attacking the online wallet.
So if an online wallet has 1000 users, its security needs to be 1000 times greater, because the reward is that much larger for the attacker. Thus, the attacker is willing to spend a lot more time on finding vulnerabilities in online wallets than he is interested in finding vulnerabilities in your PC.
It's like having your money in a bank (where there is no deposit insurance): sure, your money is in a giant safe, arguably better protected than if they were under the wooden floor in your living room, but bank robbers have a much greater incentive for robbing that bank than trying to break into your house where they might find nothing at all.

I'm not sure this has been tried on the testnet. It would, after all, require generating 210,000 blocks. But it's a fairly simple [piece of code to audit](
        int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
        nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= (nHeight / 210000);
Until now the the second line has evaluated to **50*COIN** because nHeight has been less than 210,000.
The only uncertainty I see is how nHeight is calculated in the client. If this can be altered somehow (ie. by sending out bogus blocks that somehow alter the way the client counts blocks), then we've got a problem.

I ended up paying, in total, about 2% in fees (because I wanted to convert the EUR to USD) when sending EUR as a SEPA bank transfer to Mt. Gox, and converting them to USD by first buying bitcoins with EUR and then selling them for USD:
In hindsight I'm pretty sure that this was a poor decision. There is no reason to convert your EUR to USD before buying bitcoins. Because of the smaller order book for EUR on Mt. Gox, I'm pretty sure it would have been a lot cheaper for me to just directly buy the bitcoins for EUR in small amounts spread out over a large time period. This is what I ended up doing anyway (only with USD). The arbitrage bots will make sure EUR and USD prices for bitcoins don't drift too much apart.
For a SEPA transfer my bank charges 20 DKK (€2.70), and Mt. Gox deducted €2.23 from the amount I sent (€390). Using these figures the fee is only about 1.25% (and will decrease the more money you send).

In reality, no one really knows, first of all, exactly which issues will arise, and secondly, how to fix them. This is why slow growth is in fact preferable compared to a sudden rise in usage. It gives the software (which is all Bitcoin is) time to evolve at a pace that doesn't overwhelm the developers, and gives them time to test various solutions to the scalability issues that will arise.

Agreed. This is the point where anyone who were not serious about Bitcoin would have quit.
Of course, I don't know how much money Bitcoinica makes. If they make this kind of BTC in a couple of months, then this move doesn't speak so much about their trustworthiness, as it speaks about them being able to do basic calculus.

If this isn't a scam I can't understand how it works.
Don't they need to go into the market and execute the actual trades? Or, I mean, they would only have to hold a position that is the sum of all positions (whether it be negative or positive). So if there is a total of 200 BTC at 1000:1 leverage in short positions, and 300 BTC at 1000:1 in long positions, they will have to buy 100,000 BTC in the market to hedge against this.
How is this possible? Am I missing something?
I'd love for this to be legit. Would be interesting to see how this would affect the price. I suspect it might go down somewhat, if shorting is possible that is.

These are all fantastic concepts, but I don't see them being anything other than that - concepts. How can you make a decentralized derivatives market without risking that your counterparty is unable to pay you when you want to make use of the contract?
Also, how do you envision passing USD around in a decentralized exchange? In the end you can't really own USD on a decentralized exchange as USD can't exist in a decentralized manner. You can own USD IOUs, which I think many people would be wary of depending on. The same goes for a decentralized GLBSE; how exactly do we implement this? If we don't even know if it's possible then I think it's a bit misplaced to complain about people not using more time on it. Perhaps they have spent time on it and given up because they couldn't figure out how to make it work?

Please consider posting this comment on the linked page itself. Perhaps the authors can respond directly. I'm not sure if they are aware of this post on Reddit.
Wrt. to the first point, can't we just let the input amount be desired_mixing_amount+(tx_fee*no_of_desired_mixings)? So if the user wishes to mix 25 BTC 10 times with a 0.01 fee, she starts by mixing 25.1 BTC, which turns into 25.09 and so on until it's 25 BTC and it has been mixed 10 times.
Wrt. to your second and third point, as far as I can understand they are addressed here:


Also, I think the point would be that this mixing wouldn't be used on a regular basis, but only for people who wish to spend the money (in added fees) that this requires. Sort of like how Tor is relatively expensive resource-wise, but it exists anyway because only people who need to stay anonymous use it. As far as I can see, as long as a transaction carries a fee it's not really problematic. It increases the total mining revenue and thus incentivizes more miners to join in and process the added number of transactions.

It doesn't break the blockchain, per se. All it breaks is the decentralization, in that we now have to trust that, for example, Mt. Gox will actually send us the money that it promises us, even though no transaction in the Bitcoin network has been created yet.
On the other hand, Mt. Gox can transfer funds internally much cheaper than if it were to create a Bitcoin transaction for every time it moved funds, and so its users save on the fees in exchange for having a central point of failure. Decentralization (especially in the case of Bitcoin, because of its use of proof-of-work) is expensive. So we get the added security of decentralization, but we have to pay for it (in fees). Going around this system makes transactions cheaper, but we lose the advantage of no central point of failure. The two approaches are entirely compatible. They just each serve their own purpose.

@_date: 2012-02-27 16:02:50
But in order to reverse a previous transaction, they have to discard the 10 blocks that have been found in the meantime. So if the miners who would like the 100 BTC reward have found at least two of the most recent 10 blocks, then they would have no reason to reverse these, as they'd lose the 100 BTC earned from finding these blocks.
So the fee in the transaction you mention would have to be big enough so that the blocks that would have to be orphaned/reversed gave them less reward, than the transaction they want to include now (that already is included in an earlier block) would give them.

This is interesting. I see your last paragraph states that you're not sure whether this is the case. As far as I know, the network - as it works now - will accept a longer block chain as long as it doesn't go back further than the previous check point (which is a long way back). But you're right that it wouldn't go unnoticed. But I'm fairly sure that nothing is coded into the client right now, that would make it not work. But there's no doubt that the devs would pick up on this and start working on a solution.


This only happens if the mining king chooses to build on the blocks of the other miners in the network. This is entirely optional for him. He has the majority of mining power, so he can simply choose to only make his own chain longer, effectively earning all the mining rewards himself.

Though I believe qbits exaggerates, I think he has a point. The banks are part of a system where they can borrow cheap money, that is "printed" freshly from the central bank. Of course there is competition between banks, but you have to get a license first, in order to compete. This is very different from the world of bitcoin, where no one in particular has control over the currency. Fractional reserve banking, for example, wouldn't be possible to the extent that it is practiced in today's banking system. At least not without the state guaranteeing savings in bitcoins, which I think is a long shot (nor is it even desirable, in my opinion).
Right now the banks in the US, UK and EU are overthrown with cheap money (interest rate &lt;1%). This simply isn't possible with bitcoin (or any other non-fiat currency). With bitcoin, the banks would actually have to save up money, in order to lend them out. Instead of borrowing them cheaply from a central bank, and lending out 10 times as much money as they really have.

What I would do - and what I in fact am going to (when I get around to it) - is that I would restore a wallet from paper backup once with the newest Armory version available. After having verified that this works, I will zip together all the files that are part of this Armory version, that I just used for this process, ensuring that if any future versions of Armory come that break compatibility, I will always have the old version with which I *know* it works.


What exactly do you mean with this? Armory does not support the Satoshi client's wallet format, if that's what you mean.
Bear in mind though, that Armory is alpha version software. There are bugs in it (I found some, and others found more). The developer is releasing it already because it's hard for a developer to find all the bugs in his application alone. He needs people to test it and report the bugs they find. That being said, using the above method, I can't see how this could have any influence (when first I've already verified that it works).

Yes, a rough estimate should be possible. If we use a conservative value of 1.5 MH/J (and so assume all mining is done by GPU) for energy efficiency [1] and just say that the network has been running for 13 months at a 12 TH/s average [2] (fairly good estimate) we can calculate that a total of 12,000,000 MH/s / 1.5 MH/J = 8000000 W or 8 MW. So the miners have been running at around 8 MW for 13 months, which is 9516 (13*30.5*24) hours, which results in around 76 GWh - or the equivalent of what 7000 US households use in a year - being expedited by miners in the past 13 months (which really comprise most of the mining history in Bitcoin's life span).

Interesting. I was under the impression that these unique keys that are stored in the chips, used to derive private keys and MAC addresses and so on, weren't "printed" with the resolution of the production process (28 nm, 22 nm, 40 nm, etc.) though. Isn't it only the transistors that are this size? I just presumed that this was "etched" more roughly into the silicon somehow, but I really have no idea how it works. I mean, how, exactly, is this unique key read from the physical chip? What device in the chip reads the key from where it's physically etched into the chip? I presume it has to read from the actual physical structure that contains the code in order to perform calculations with the data (encryption, signing, etc).

(a) Doesn't make much sense to me, since I would rather loan out my money at a lower interest rate to a person I trust, than at a higher interest rate to someone I suspect will not pay me back. The whole reason for loaning out the money (for me at least) is making a profit, and the premium is supposed to compensate for any uncertainties. Loaning out my money at 10% per year to someone I think has a 1% chance of defaulting on his debt is better than loaning out my money at 50% per year to someone I deem will default on his debt 30% of the time.
There is not necessarily any higher profit in loaning out money at a higher interest rate; it depends on the debtors ability to pay back the loan, so I don't agree with Adam Smith on that one.
(b) Sure. And I would take all that into account when determining the interest rate I would charge, and the collateral it would require.

To be fair to Mr. Lewis, this - I believe - *was* the case until Bitcoin. Anyone issuing a commodity-backed currency really had to establish a positive track record first. No one would just accept some gold-backed currency by some new company or bank. The thing about bitcoin is that it's really not a currency, if you ask me. It's more like money, in that it isn't 'backed' by anything, it's more like gold in that regard. People use it to trade because it benefits them.

Also keep in mind that the price of bitcoins denominated in US Dollars is as much a property of the US Dollar as it is a property of bitcoin.
What I'm trying to say is that if the dollar experiences hyperinflation then bitcoins (priced in dollars) will experience hyperdeflation. But that wouldn't be the fault of bitcoin, but of the US Dollar.
Another interesting measure would be the price of bitcoins measured in gold ounces. We'll need some more time to make that figure more meaningful for historically comparative purposes, but it'll be interesting to see how constant this figure will be compared to USD price.

Indeed. The "1" at the start of every current bitcoin address denotes the version of that address. Without much fuss we could create a new version of bitcoin-addresses that all start with "2" and use some quantum computer-safe public/private key algorithm. The old clients wouldn't know how to handle this, of course, so they'd just ignore them.

Add to that that the present imbalances are probably many times larger than they were in 1929. The crash in 1929 occurred after relatively mild (by today's standards) monetary expansion by the Fed since its inception in 1913 (or that is the Austrian interpretation at least). This all happened on a gold standard which, at least to some degree, restricted money creation by the Fed because they promised to buy back the FRNs for gold.
We're currently about 25 years into monetary expansion this time (from around 1987, following Volcker's rate increases to eradicate rampant  inflation in the beginning of the 1980s, to now), and this time the Fed has no direct liabilities when it issues FRNs. Take a look at this graph for the St. Louis Adjusted Monetary Base (a way of measuring how much base money (reserve money out of which the money we use in our everyday lives are created) is in existence): [link to graph](
That graph is just insane. Compare the practically invisible increase from 1913 to 1929 with the increase from 1987-ish to present. Of course it should be stressed that this is the monetary *base*, which is not the money we use when we pay for a cup of coffee. It's basically proportional to how much money the banks could create (without getting into trouble) - through extending loans, for example - if they wished. But still, it's not exactly promising.

It's open source, there is no hidden private key to access content. The way you decrypt a file is using its SHA256 checksum as the key. In other words, in order to decrypt a file you need to have information that is only accessible from the decrypted file. So you need someone to inform you of the file hash, or you won't know what it is you're distributing. Sort of like torrents: you need the torrent file to identify the files you're downloading. One could imagine a site like The Pirate Bay putting up SHA256 sums for files (which would then be the files' 'identifier') and then you'd request content from this P2P storage service based on that identifier.

Right. I was talking about the variable that holds the divisibility. Currently it is set to 100,000,000 (8 decimal places), but since it's 64 bit (ie., it can hold 64 bits of information at most), it can contain numbers all the way from 1 to 2^64 (~10^19). Without knowing for sure, this might be the "unused bits" Satoshi was talking about. Currently, only 27 bits out of the 64 bits that the COIN variable (the variable that determines the divisibility as far as I can gather) can hold are used (to represent the value 100,000,000). So there are 37 unused bits left. More than enough to increase divisibility far beyond what's necessary.

It's mostly due to an inefficient client. It's not inherent to Bitcoin.
With a fast disk it's possible to receive and verify the entire block chain in around 30 minutes. This is made possible through software improvements in the original Bitcoin client: 
The initial download of the block chain using the original client is currently disk bound. It writes too much to the hard drive, and if this is a slow one it will take forever. What the client should do, IMO, is use more RAM. Right now it's using about 1.5% on a machine with 4GB (=~60 MB) which is way too little. If it placed the entire block chain in memory (which is possible on systems with 4GB of ram) the initial download wouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
@_date: 2012-08-20 23:56:52
As far as I know there are (at least) two causes. First is that clients that are online at different times will have different orphaned blocks. If I'm online when you're not, and a block is published that isn't built on, it will be added to my block chain file. When you come online, you won't download this block because it isn't in the longest chain, and my block chain file will be bigger than yours.
A greater factor, I think, is when some sort of error happens (perhaps the block chain file becomes corrupted?), and the client ignores all present blocks in the file (or a part of them) and starts downloading the chain all over again (or from some earlier point) onto the already existing blocks. I've had a block chain file that was 3 GB back when the block chain was only 1.5 GB, and I was told that this was two concatenated block chains in one block chain file, and that if I deleted the file and let the block chain download again it would reduce in size. It worked.
Remember that the block chain file(s) are never deleted from, they are only added to. The database file (blkindex.dat) keeps track of which blocks in the block chain file are actually used.

30 million dollars is a really interesting figure. I must admit that I'm not sure I expect the Bitcoin community to be willing to fork out $30m for mining equipment.
If we look at the hash rate of the network at the start of 2012, when there were no BFL Singles, and the network generally consisted of GPUs (and the few FPGAs of amateur hardware dudes tinkering with these), the network hash rate was 10TH. If we assume a hardware price of 2 MH/s/$ ([which is fairly low]( that would mean there was mining hardware for a total price of $5m USD.
This is rough number of course, and only includes the actual graphics cards, not the rest of the setup. So let's say $7-8m USD. Does it seem reasonable that miners are willing to spend an additional $50m on hardware within the next year (that is, two years after Jan 2012 when there were only GPUs)? I mean, it's definitely possible, not the least because the bitcoin price has increased, but also because more miners have simply entered the market, so it's not likely that the same people who bought for $7m will buy for an additional $50m.
When the block reward drops to 25 BTC around the first of December, using current prices a total of $15.5m will be produced *per year*. So if miners indeed are going to spend $50m on mining equipment, they're looking at several *years* before it has paid back.
Making the calculation more complicated is the fact that the BTC price will increase over time. But it is important to note here that this isn't relevant, as if you expect the BTC price to rise, it's much more profitable to just buy bitcoins now, and wait for them to appreciate, than it is to mine them, slowly earning them over time, and sell them off while they appreciate. Another factor is that the addition of hashing power to the network will not necessarily stop after those $50m are spent. If there is excess money to be made, more will join the network.
All in all, *if* $50m is going to be spent buying ASIC mining equipment within the next year or two, the time it will take to recoup ones initial investment doesn't look too good. A three year figure seems reasonable, given price increases and added network hash power. Of course, the ones that receive their equipment first will have a *huge* advantage, and it might even be the case that these people break even after a few months, while the ones who receive their equipment much later will never break even.

This script will download the signature file made by Gavin with each release of Bitcoin. It checks that the signature on the hashes of the various Bitcoin-executables matches, downloads the files in question, and checks if the hashes that Gavin has signed match those of the downloaded files.
This prevents an attacker from placing maliciously modified Bitcoin executables on SourceForge, since this script would warn that the files have been tampered with. If Gavin can keep his key a secret - and this script runs regularly on as many computers/servers as possible - it will be virtually impossible for anyone to modify the binaries hosted on SourceForge without us noticing.
The script returns 0 if everything matches, 1 if either the signature or hashes don't match, and 2 if another error occurs. Another script should be made that runs regularly - daily/hourly - and sends an email if the signature/hash verification script returns either 1 or 2 (the latter indicating that the script has failed for some reason).
This script requires Gavin's code signing GPG key to be installed on the system. It can be installed on a Linux system using the following command:

TL;DR: It's expensive to do this. Transactions cost money. The more frequently you send a certain bunch of bitcoins around, there more expensive it becomes, until the point where people won't relay your transactions unless you pay an extraordinarily high fee, at which point you're welcome to spam the network; you're giving away money to the miners.
This is a bit like saying you could DoS the VISA network by sending a lot of transactions simultaneously. Sure, you could, and VISA would probably be happy if you did, as they make 3% of every transaction sent. More money for them.

An estimate that I would claim would be within reason is 50W for the Jalapeño. That's around 70 MH/J, which is a 200% improvement (x3) over FPGAs. I think this is sensible (if they are even released). So to heat a room you'd probably need at least a kilowatt (depending on how cold it is of course), which would then cost you 20*$149=$3000. Or you could save some money on purchasing two BitForce SC Singles instead, for a total of $2600.
Now if you actually want to heat a room you'd need to hook it up to a thermostat, unless you want to pump a full kilowatt out all the time, so your thousand dollar hardware would basically be sitting idle some of the time, especially when the weather is hot. Not a good investment if you ask me.

Sure they could. And that's one reason that future bitcoin bank users wouldn't trust a bank with their coins. And that's really the main point; they don't *have* to trust a bank with their bitcoins, as opposed to with fiat money.


I think you're right. It will still happen. But the important part is not whether it will happen or not happen at all, it's to what extent it will happen. And I think it will happen a lot less than with regular banking. Private fiat money banks have already set the bar pretty high wrt. reserve ratios. It will be hard for bitcoin banks to reach this level, with the degree of freedom that bitcoin users have.

You're right. An address is a *hash* of a public key.
To get the public key associated with an address you need to use the command line version of the bitcoin client (as far as I know), called bitcoind. You then copy an address in your wallet that you want to find the public key for, and run the following command (by starting a the "cmd" program in Windows, if that's what you're running):
    bitcoind validateaddress &lt;address&gt;
This will give an output in the following format:
    {
        "isvalid" : true,
        "address" : "1F6vCsqmwn95mdgYPAqs2EK3h2zq6S5CXw",
        "ismine" : true,
        "isscript" : false,
        "pubkey" : "04b50cc031fc23b41e622ced70ca76820ab68489a4dcbfdc54b06ee7ee3fd2ad4559ff0a1a0321549777f47a33143aa618e4910584fb9817aefcb7ff3653992948",
        "iscompressed" : false,
        "account" : "armory test"
    }
The public key is in the "pubkey" field, which is 04b50cc031fc23b41e622ced70ca76820ab68489a4dcbfdc54b06ee7ee3fd2ad4559ff0a1a0321549777f47a33143aa618e4910584fb9817aefcb7ff3653992948 in this case.

I have not had any poor experiences with Mt. Gox.
With regards to that site (mtgoxsucks.org), it seems there isn't a lot (if any) specific complaints about Mt. Gox. They mention the hack several times. That's seems fair. It should, in my opinion, be mentioned every time Mt. Gox is recommended. Regardless of how large they are. I realize now that I didn't mention that in my previous post, perhaps because I assumed you knew it already, but that is certainly relevant information. The question, at least for me, is whether using a once-hacked exchange is actually safer than a never-hacked one. I wouldn't count on an exchange being safer just because it hasn't been hacked. At least Mt. Gox has the capital to hire security specialists if they think it's necessary.
If you feel Mt. Gox isn't worth supporting, then I assume that a smaller exchange could serve you just as well. I've also traded briefly on Intersango without any problems. They might be worth checking out. They're UK-based though, so I'm not sure how easy (or cheap) wire transfers from the US are. But make sure to go check out the forum posts about a certain exchange before deciding. I'm sure Mt. Gox isn't the only exchange where users have felt mistreated.

Nothing would have been lost for bitcoin as such. Only for those who lost their money. Only when we get to a point where the smallest denomination (1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin) is worth more than the cheapest transactions people want to send do we have a problem.

Please beware that you are not describing the "truth", you are describing the Keynesian economist's point of view. Most people in power agree with this view, but this view is not the only one.
Another view is that of the Austrian school of economics, which says that printing money and using it to provide cheap credit (loans) to banks creates growth in the short run, but must eventually lead to recession, unless it's offset by another round of money "printing" (quantitative easing). But this, they say, will just further postpone the unavoidable recession, and amplify it when it does come. Austrians a pretty clear when they say that you cannot create anything by printing money, you can only move around the crises (while at the same time necessarily amplifying the crises that do come).

That this scenario will just eventually be unavoidable to live out is wishful thinking, IMO. There's no reason that imaging technology will ever progress to the point where we can scan all the particles of any object perfectly. Just the mere presence of the uncertainty principle seems to preclude this from being possible.
In addition to that, even if we had a perfect 'model' of the brain: have any perfect theory been developed about how all known particles interact with each other? I'm pretty sure physicians are still out on that one. So that's an extra thing missing.
I think simulating reality will continue to be an imperfect science - by necessity -, and I also think that simply simulating a brain, and thinking we can create intelligence out of that is wrong. I don't think intelligence is 'created' by the brain, just as I don't think intelligence is created by a bacteria, or cell, or whatever else can be said to be intelligent. In basic terms I think that intelligence is the essence of what we are, and consequently, we can never really know what it is, because no thing can ever understand itself; it requires something beyond that thing to understand it.

If the price is going to explode it makes more sense just buying up bitcoins rather than mining. Also, I don't see any reason that these dedicated miners will be more prone to hoarding - they want a return on their investment, probably. Care to explain why you think they will be more likely to hoard than current miners?
Wrt. to the reward reduction rate, you're completely right. Monetary inflation will drop instantly from 33% annualized in 2012 (1 BTC created for every 3 BTC in existence) to 12.5% annualized in 2013 (0.5 BTC created for every 4 BTC in existence).

I guess the problem with this is that you'd have to trust miners, instead of being able to verify that your coins have not been spent two times or more. When you have the entire block chain you can check and see if your own coins are spent or not.
Also, clients wouldn't be able to pass on transactions, as they wouldn't know if they were valid or not.
Aren't you just talking about SPV (Simple Payment Verification), though? It's described in the original white paper by Satoshi.

It seems someone has, at least partially, cornered the Bitcoin market on Mt. Gox [1]. Now bear in mind, this is possible for anyone to do currently with a relatively low amount of money. Bitcoin is a pretty small economy. As Bitcoin grows this will be harder and harder to do.
In the 1950s two guys successfully cornered the onion futures market [2]. In other words, someone cornering a market doesn't mean the traded commodity has failed, it just means it has sufficiently low value for someone to enter into it and buy up enough of the assets to control it to a certain degree. Saying that Bitcoin has failed because someone has cornered the market is a bit like saying onions have failed because someone succeeded in cornering the onion futures market.

A bot that makes sure than Bitcoinica doesn't lose any money in case a customer wins a bet he's made.
Example: customer goes short 10:1 (borrows 10 times more bitcoin than he has and sells it). Hedging bot would then sell this amount on Mt. Gox, so that if the price falls (and the customer can buy back the bitcoins he sold and pocket the difference), Bitcoinica wouldn't have lost any money because they, too, can buy back the money they sold on Mt. Gox for a lower price (and give the difference to the customer, minus fees (spread)).
With multiple customers doing this, the bot only hedges the difference between all the customer's bets, of course (Bitcoinica's exposure). But this example illustrates what it does.

Game theory states that a bet is only possibly profitable in the long run if the odds you get in case an event occurs are greater than the odds of the event occurring. Thus, it's not possible to assess whether one thinks a bet will be profitable - in the long run - on betsofbitcoin.
Example: we do a coin toss. 50% chance of heads, 50% for tails. If I can get 1:2 odds on that, in the long run I will neither win nor lose money. The bet is not profitable. If, however, someone is willing to give me 1:2.05 odds, then in the long run I will win money and he will lose money. If we play 100 times, then - on average - I will win $1.05 50 times and he will win $1.00 50 times. If I don't know the odds I will get from guessing correctly either heads or tails, I have no way to judge whether a bet is - on average - profitable. Imagine playing heads or tails and finding out that if you win you only win $0.50, but if you lose you lose $1.00. No one would make that bet.
It's not about knowing ones exact returns; these can never be known. It's about judging whether you think a certain bet would earn you money in the long run. For this you use the odds you get for winning, coupled with your assessment of the odds of the event happening.
I'm not saying betsofbitcoin isn't useful. It's obviously useful to a lot of people since they are using it. I'm just saying that it's not possible to figure out whether you believe a bet will be profitable in the long run, and so, whether it's a "good bet".

As far as I've understood it, some guy borrowed around 21,000 bitcoins and sold them (that's called 'short selling').
He had ~$13k in his account. Using a 10:1 leverage, Bitcoinica allowed him to borrow for ~$130k bitcoins at roughly $6/BTC. That's about 21,000 BTC. He then sold these borrowed bitcoins, and bought them all back for around $105.5k. Thus making around $24,500 in circa 30 minutes.

Inflation destroys savings, meaning that companies *lose* capital, and so are less able to invest in new ventures. This halts job creation and increases unemployment. It also robs the people of their savings, which mean they have to divert a larger part of their income into savings (to reestablish what was lost), which results in a decrease in aggregate demand, and bankruptcies as the market adapts to this new, lower level of aggregate demand. So you're not really mitigating a crisis, you're sewing the seeds for a new one.

The problem with this approach is that you need to modify *all* the p2pool programs on all the p2pool miners' computers. Each p2pool peer checks the transactions for validity and it won't accept them just because someone else does.
A more meaningful target would be the Bitcoin client itself, hosted at bitcoin.org. The way to do it would be to inject some code that only triggers itself when at least 50% have the infected client running. Still, this would be noticed at some point. So although it would create disruption, it wouldn't necessarily bring down the network.

The divisibility of bitcoins can be changed in the client when it becomes necessary. The number of times a coin can be divided is currently held in a 64 bit number. This means that the current maximum of divisibility (without having to change the COIN variable type) is around 10^19, or enough to - currently - give every person on earth 30 million billion indivisible units.
Without being sure, I do assume that a change in the divisibility will require a hard fork, which means that an old client will not work when this change is introduced. If this is the case then it's something that has to be decided well in advance, and then take effect a number of years after the decision. **EDIT:** Actually, looking at transactions I'm not sure this is the case. The amount is specified using a decimal number, so it might just be possible that new transactions can include more digits after the decimal points and old clients will work fine (but only be able to spend 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin)

I'd think so too. Or the other way around: at least the reply to the authentication request should prove that the replier (what is supposedly the LR server) also knows the secret key. As far as I can understand from [the API]( there is no reply from LR that proves they also have the secret key. It's just an "OK. Key accepted.". It could be an attacker sending the reply without even having to know the key.
On further thought, it is flawed - perhaps fatally - that LR is not using HMAC to sign requests. When using SHA-256 (as opposed to HMAC-SHA-256) the problem is that it iterates through the message 512 bits at a time. This means that if I hash:
and an attacker knows the hash of this, an attacker can find the hash of a message with something appended to the end, like:
&lt;secret&gt;+&lt;message&gt;+&lt;hacker's message&gt;
which will be as valid as the previous message. He can do this by figuring out the internal state of the variables in the hash function, initializing the hash function with these variables, and continue from where the previous hash function left off.
I'm not good enough at this stuff to figure it out, but this may be exactly what happened. If it is fatal enough, it's possible that an attacker could intercept the HTTP request to LR, which is in the format "&lt;secret&gt;:date:hour", and would currently be:
    &lt;secret&gt;:20120801:23
and then, using the hash in the HTTP request, restore the internal state of the SHA-256 hash function and change the hour value to an hour later and use this to authenticate with LR.
In fact, a similar vulnerability was present in Flickr's API and was discovered back in 2009: 
I'm not sure if, when using a "secret prefix" (as its known), one is able to replace the last part of the message, or if it's just possible to add something to the end though.
In any case it seems LR's API is pretty broke.

They're lower than they were four months ago, that's for sure. But whether it's actually a sale, or if the Euro will stabilise at a lower level only time will tell. That being said, I've converted most of my savings into USD. I don't at all feel confident that it will survive. Although Jim Rickards disagrees with me on that, and he actually has some good points (the ECB has 10,000 tonnes of gold in storage that they would be able to use as collateral if shit really hits the fan vs. the US's 8,000 tonnes).
So if you're a precious metals/hard money advocate, a 1.25 conversion rate makes sense. Funny that the market values it pretty accurately at around that level right now.

I think the current weak point is the 160 bit address length. The underlying ECDSA uses 256 bit keys, but it doesn't matter because all you need is the corresponding private key to a public key that hashes to a 160 bit value to spend coins associated with that address.

I agree that a deflationary currency (like bitcoins or gold) may not be a suitable national currency, because it cannot be devalued.

Only difference being that it's actually feasible (and incredibly easy) to transfer from one person to another.

You sending a transaction to someone depends on computers that verify your transaction. If it's valid, they stamp it with an "APPROVED" stamp, and everyone else who sees your transaction with this stamp on it will now accept your transaction as having happened. It will be recorded in the long list that contains *all* bitcoin transaction that have ever happened. This costs money for the person who verifies the transactions because it requires the transaction-verifiers (also called "miners") to run a computer that verifies the transaction.
In addition to your fee, the miners get a reward on top of that for every bunch of transactions they successfully verify. This is how new bitcoins are created. The amount of newly created bitcoins decreases over time, and will never exceed 21 million. As we get closer to this point in time, a larger and larger part of the money that miners make will be made up of transaction fees. The fees people pay will then be what determines how many people verify transactions, and therefore how well all the transaction that happen have been verified, and so, how well we can trust these transactions - and future transactions.

Oh I completely agree that ASIC miners in the hands on the population are not a problem; quite the contrary. The only entity I imagine that is willing to attack the Bitcoin network is some government, and even that I think isn't plausible at the moment. Everyone else will simply not have an economic incentive to do it. The government, however, can spend tax money on it, and really has an incentive to not let money become free. I think they're the only adversary that can pose a possible threat to Bitcoin. But I think the case will be that when the government realizes that Bitcoin really *is* a threat, it will be too late.


Yes they can. If they have more hashing power than the rest of the network they can "go back in time" in the block chain, and replace previous blocks with their own, effectively taking coins from people that got them from these blocks' block rewards and fees.

Whoever finds the block gets his say. Peers that don't find a block get no say. If the block is valid it will get accepted by the network (and so whatever vote is in the coinbase will count). The other p2pool peers have no influence on what a block-finding peer puts in the coinbase.

This is correct as far as I know. Your client list the transaction's date according to when it learned about it. So the transaction might have been sent into the network in March and included in a block at that time, but when you open the client and it updates the transaction information, it will note the transaction time to be when it learns about a block containing it.
At least, when I look in my transaction log, I have four consecutive incomes from mining all at the same time (same minute), and I'm quite sure four blocks weren't found in one minute.

Have you considered making MultiBit not free of charge, and only letting users download a "trial" version? The trial version would simply pop up a message once in a while saying that "this is only a trial, please pay when your trial is up", but otherwise function properly. You let it be completely up to the users when they think their trial is up. [Sublime Text]( uses this approach. I would consider using the same approach if I were to develop an app. It would be open source, everyone would be able to download it for free and run it, but you would simply say "the cost is 1 BTC". You wouldn't actually enforce it, just a friendly reminder that this is the cost of the program, until they pay the price and obtain a license code (which could be trivially broken if people wanted to, because it's open source). I think this minor psychological change could change your income dramatically. I mean, when you're offering a program for free, you really can't say anything when people don't pay for it, it's free after all.

Interesting. I thought the sqrt( 2^n ) only applied to collision attacks, ie. you have a 50% chance of generating the same key of n bit-entropy if you try 2^n/2 times. This is caused by the key space growing larger and larger as you generate keys, because you're not trying to generate any specific key, just two keys that are identical (to any one key you've previously generated).
If we have a 256 bit private key, then each private key that is generated will have a 1/2^256 chance of being the correct one, right? How does this translate into 2^128 tries, on average, to find a specific private key?

When you start receiving new blocks from the network, they will reference the old block chain's hash (that you got from somewhere else), and won't build on top of that chain unless the "previous hash" field matches. So as far as I can tell there's no way to trick users with a fake block chain (for long) (if they're online).
This might be a better source for block chains though:  it's from the official Bitcoin repository. If you trust the client itself (which we all do) I see no reason you should't trust the block chain here as well.

The site in question generates the private key in Javascript, which runs on the user's own computer. So assuming the code isn't replaced with something else, no one will know the private key. I'd prefer using a program on my own computer though, instead of code on a site that could change at any moment.
The mining method itself works without the "vanity miner" knowing the private key. You start by creating a key pair (a private and a public key). Let's call these keys Priv^start and Pub^start. Then you give Pub^start to the vanity miner and he starts creating new public keys, and each public key he creates he adds to your public key, Pub^start. If the two keys added together result in an address with the desired prefix, he sends the corresponding private key for that public key to you, and you get your resulting private key by adding Priv^start to the private key you've received from the miner.
Think of it as you creating a random number. Then someone else creates a random number too. You then take the other guys random number and add to your own random number, and even though the other guy knows one of these two random numbers, he can't know the resulting random number. If Z=X+Y and you only know Y, you can't calculate Z.

You say the opposite is about to happen, but that isn't the case is it? Wouldn't the opposite be a decrease in the money supply? The monetary inflation rate will drop, but Bitcoins aren't removed from circulation because of the reward reduction.

You get paid when the network finds a block. If you stop mining, and the network doesn't find a block in the following 24 hours, you don't get paid anything.
This is the variance that comes with a smaller pool. You could have been lucky and gotten paid five times while you were mining, but it also happens that you don't get paid anything in a two day period.

You're right, that is one attack venue. Though it should be mentioned that this would require completely taking over SourceForge, monitoring their traffic, and noticing who downloads on a regular basis, and then controlling what they send out.
This, however, can be circumvented with servers having different intervals at which they run the script. If you have 100 different servers running the script once every three months, it will be checked every day, and an attacker will have a very hard time discerning someone who downloads the Bitcoin executables one time every three months from a regular user.

The solution is simple. Put your private key on a USB stick bolted onto a 10-ton lead cube. Now stealing your bitcoins is as handy as stealing 10 tons of gold.
The more freedom you have to control your own money, the easier it is for someone to steal them. Everything in life imposes a set of limitations. The relative ease with which bitcoins can be transferred from person to person makes them suitable for transferring wealth over the internet, but at the same time makes it easier for robbers to carry all that he robs with him. Every time we overcome a certain set of limitations in the physical realm, another set of limitations apply. There is no way getting around that.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. You imply that an adversary has some limited time frame to hash the old blocks, I don't see why this is the case. As I wrote in my example, if we're at block 190,000, and someone with 52.4% of the hashing power starts mining at block 189,900, he will have produced a chain of equal length to the rest of the network after 7.5 days, ie. they will both be at block 191,000 after 7.5 days.


I'm just suggesting that an adversary make a longer chain, which - if it doesn't go further back than a check point - will make this the "correct" chain, according to Bitcoin protocol, as far as I know.

That would be a very bad idea. It would increase the difficulty very quickly and, when they stop mining, the network would produce blocks at half the regular speed (every 20 minutes). Additionally, the 2016-block adjustment period would now be four weeks, so this would go on for some time. A gradual increase is much better.

It's not just moving the problem around, in my opinion. As things are now, someone can hack SourceForge, replace the binaries with their own, and no one would notice. If this script runs regularly on just 10 servers, chances are extremely good that at least one or two have the correct public keys (I'd think all of them would have the correct key, why wouldn't key?). You're saying it's as easy for an attacker to replace every server's public key with the attacker's own public key. It's not. That's the whole point of doing this in a distributed manner - ie. multiple servers doing the same task, and each of them reporting if they find a discrepancy.

The 'cumulative' figure for the bids represents the total number of bitcoins that people are willing to buy at the *selected price or higher*. The 'cumulative' figure for the asks represents the total number of bitcoins people are offering to sell at the *selected price or lower*.
In other words, if we have an order book that looks like this:
    Bid Size 	Price 	Ask Size
    -----------------------------
                12.15    8
                12.10    10
                12.05    4
                12.00    1
    2           11.95	
    20          11.90	
    5           11.85	
    10          11.80	
The 'cumulative' figure at the price point 11.85 would be 27 BTC (2+20+5). The 'cumulative' figure at the price point 12.10 would be 15 BTC (1+4+10).
The 'liquidity' figure in this case would simply be price*volume. Ie. for 11.85: $321.15 (2×11.95+20×11.90+5×11.85), and for 12.10 would be $181.20 (12.00×1+12.05×4+12.10×10).




Why they are doing this is hard to know. It could be bots trying to make a profit, as you describe. I would assume figures that small are bots, because only bots - being able to place and remove orders quickly - can make any meaningful profit buying/selling 0.01 BTC at a time. You'd have to look up some specific trading strategies to figure that out. Some bots put in orders in trying to manipulate traders (maybe other bots) into buying or selling.
In your example it seems that someone (could be a bot) has put in bids at 0.01 BTC at one cent intervals (11.40, 11.39, 11.38, 11.37 etc.) and the orders that don't show just 0.01 BTC in size is because there are other bids at the same price (the numbers reflect total number of bitcoins bid on at that price; it could be - and probably is - from different individuals).

As an interesting side point: banks - as we know them today - were unheard of in the 17th century - before a small group of people began understanding the power of being a money producer. After that the state started giving out licenses to businesses (banks) to produce "legal tender", ie. money which everyone were forced to accept at some established exchange rate. This is when banks started growing and becoming an increasingly larger part of the economy. Having the right to produce money basically means being able to transfer wealth from all owners of that money to oneself. It's an immensely powerful ability, and one that is often overlooked.

A good Linux trick is doing the initial block chain download to a directory that is a mounted tmpfs file system. This requires enough RAM to hold the block chain files, though, which is currently 3.5 GB, so it might not be an option for you. Remember to copy the files to your HDD before you restart though.
As others have mentioned, the database (BerkeleyDB) that the client currently uses for indexing the block chain is really slow. This will be improved in version 0.7 (or is it 0.8?) when we migrate to LevelDB. But until then, tmpfs works well (with enough RAM).

8 chips per SC Single means they would have to sell for $16M singles at $1299 per device in order to get rid of all the chips. I'm pretty sure they're not going to do that any time soon. So either they're left with a lot of chips or they have to lower prices on later products.

The problem could be that someone with a physical slip of paper with a bitcoin addresses printed on it might think this makes him the owner of bitcoins. When this is in fact not the case. Ownership of houses, stocks, bonds and securities are all proven by the possession of a slip of paper (or the electronic equivalent hereof). But this is not the case with bitcoins. Confusing people into thinking otherwise might pose a problem.

I guess I'm not saying it can't work, just like SSL works sort of. I'm just saying it won't be elegant. But maybe that's too much to ask. The fact is that as long as a compromised private key hasn't been put on a recovation list, any programs relying on a server identifying with that key can be compromised. So targeted attacks could exist, although they wouldn't last indefinitely.


I suspect this works as much through obscurity. I mean, how many hackers have been given the chance to probe the device that secures nuclear bombs? It's kind of hard to prove the resilience of a system if no one gets to try to circumvent it. Intel chips, on the other hand, will be in the hands of anyone who buys them.

Mining is *both* a way to initially distribute Bitcoins, *and* the way that transactions are verified. Currently, miners get 50 bitcoins for every block (lump) of transactions they successfully verify. This amount halves every, circa, four years. So the production rate of new bitcoins slows down, but transaction fees (which the miners also earn, in addition to the mined bitcoins) will always be there for the miners to earn.


The price of the energy used to mine bitcoins will tend to be slightly lower than the price of the produced bitcoins; otherwise people wouldn't mine (as it would cost more money in electricity than they would get from mining).

If the exchanges are selling bitcoins they don't have, all we have to do is organize a simultaneous withdrawal from the suspected exchange. If it succeeds, they are fully backed. If not, they are busted. No further action is needed.

Wouldn't it be sufficient to present the user to a CAPTCHA and let the Flash program pass the result back to the server for verification? Ie. the server grants your IP a single playing session for - for example - 60 minutes when you solve a CAPTCHA. Of course you can't prevent the user from saving the flv and decompiling it, but it's useless to the user if he can't use the Flash program to connect to their server and actually play against other people.

What is the basis for making this statement? Viewed as secure by whom? I tend to agree with Dan Kaminsky on this (here's [his reply]( to this discovery on the above mailing list). If small bugs like these are found periodically, there's a good chance there's a lot more of them hiding somewhere in the code, or being introduced by new commits. Gavin isn't a security specialist, nor can he - or any of the other developers - be expected to create bug free code when many of them are using their free time for coding, and there is no formal QA.

In that case, at least we would know that we have no one to blame but ourselves. That's good to know.
It's not vital that we withdraw exactly 100% of the funds though. Withdrawing, say 90%, means that Mt. Gox can only create 10% extra bitcoins (if they dare) which would mean minimal additional coins in the economy.
The more long term solution would be to spread trade out over more exchanges. This would make the actions of a single exchange less important. Let's hope someone arrives and underbids Mt. Gox significantly.

As far as I can figure out, the only sustainable increase in security of the Bitcoin network comes from an increase in the bitcoin price, from which an increase in miner's revenue will follow. This will attract more miners and secure the network better.
Without ASICs the only threat currently is from an ASIC producer. With ASICs the only real threat is still an ASIC producer, that now only needs to produce more chips to mount a 51% attack. The large costs associated with producing custom mining chips is not from the actual chips, it's the development and engineering costs, which will be the same regardless of the network hash rate.
@_date: 2012-09-15 19:22:41


What? Any single government - or large bank, for example - can easily produce enough ASICs to take over the network. How many orders do you think BFL has gotten? I doubt for more than $5m. So if a government invested $50m they could easily get 95% of the total hashing power.


I agree. I never argued that it was a credible threat. As I said, I think the government will realize how much of a threat Bitcoin - being sound money - is to them when it's too late. I very much doubt they would go out of their way to do anything about the Bitcoin network.


What do you mean? It's a matter of how long they are willing to spend, recreating old blocks, that determines how much hashing power they need. The more old blocks they want to rewrite, it will just take them longer and longer to produce a chain. They don't need to have any exact amount of hashing power relative to the network.
For example, if they want to rewrite 100 blocks and they have 1.1 times as much hashing power as the rest of the network (giving them 52.4% of the total hashing power), they would have to produce 1100 blocks to make a block chain which is the same length of the original one (in the time they produce 1100 blocks, the rest of the network only produces 1000 blocks). Every additional block they create after here will be more likely to create a longer chain, because they have more hashing power. So after about 7.5 days (1100 blocks * 10 minutes / 60 min. per hr. / 24 hr. per day) after they start mining on their alternate chain, they would have a chain with a length equal to that of the original chain, but with the original chain's last 100 blocks replaced with their own.

    ( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists
    ( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business
    
    Specifically, your plan fails to account for
    
    ( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it
    ( ) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email
    ( ) Open relays in foreign countries
    ( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses
    ( ) Asshats

    and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
    
    (x) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical
    ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
    ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
    ( ) Blacklists suck
    ( ) Whitelists suck
    ( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks
    ( ) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually
    (x) Sending email should be free
    ( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
    ( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses
    ( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
    ( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
    ( ) I don't want the government reading my email
    ( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough
    
    Furthermore, this is what I think about you:
    
    (x) Sorry dude, but I don't think it would work.
    ( ) This is a stupid idea, and you're a stupid person for suggesting it.

It doesn't get rid of it, it just makes it harder. If people experience bank runs on banks holding bitcoins, future holders of bitcoins won't keep their bitcoins at a bank, but will withdraw them immediately.
With Bitcoin this is feasible since you are able to - without participation from the bank - transfer your money to someone else digitally. This is not possible with fiat currencies, and one of the reasons that our current monetary system depends on private banks.

I checked CPU usage and the bitcoin-qt process never used 100% constantly during this phase. It was more like going up to 20-ish % and then dropping to zero for a while.
So it looks like the block fetching mechanism is more likely to be the bottleneck.
My CPU takes around 1300 us to do a signature verification, so that's around 750 CHECKSIG's per second.
The last 20 blocks had an average of 180 transactions per block, so if we assume that each transaction has an average of 3 CHECKSIG's, that's only a little over a single block per second. So that actually sounds like a plausible candidate for the slowdown. But I can't figure out why this CPU activity didn't register in Ubuntu's System Monitor.

They do it because it's best for the network. A double spend could be pulled if miners used the transaction with the highest transaction fee instead of the first one they see.
But you make a good point. Why wouldn't miners include the transaction with the highest fee instead of the first one? They are economically incentivized to do the former. Seems like a real issue, unless I'm missing something. Only for services accepting unconfirmed transactions though. But still, an issue.

Couldn't have said it better myself. Developing self-replicating computer programs is the wet dream of any AI-enthusiast. No one have been able to do it yet, in the way it has been imagined. If I had to make a bet I'd say it isn't possible at all. Human beings can't develop something that is more intelligent than themselves. This isn't possible. Intelligence can't be produced or created. No system can produce something that is more advanced than itself. Whenever we see a computer program functioning, it's not "AI", it's *human* intelligence, transformed into a computer program. Saying that a computer program is intelligent is the same as saying that my stereo is intelligent because it can play sound by itself.
But anyway, that's my - as I experience it - fringe view. I'm sure it doesn't please many geeks dreaming of the 'singularity' :).

The only collateral he had was $13,000. This meant that if the bitcoin exchange rate rose to a certain point, he would be forced to buy back the bitcoins he had sold, in order to pay back his bitcoin loan.
As it turned out, he hadn't actually bought back any bitcoins, he had only sold a lot of bitcoins that he had borrowed. So he hadn't made any money per se, because he still owed Bitcoinica 21,000 BTC. Someone suspected this was the case, and bought a lot of bitcoins. This caused the BTC price to reach the point were the shorter was forced to buy back the bitcoins he had loaned, at a higher price than he sold them for. Thus losing a lot of money.

Apparently this has been refuted by BFL themselves. The Jalapeño will require external power, although the device itself (when not running) will be powered by USB.
This is also in line with efficiency characteristics of the process technology most likely available to BFL. Ie. even at state of the art process technologies (28 nm TSMC, 32 nm Samsung) this figure would barely be obtainable, and production costs at these facilities are in the order hundreds of millions of dollars, suitable for general use CPUs and GPUs, not niche SHA-256 hashing engines.

@_date: 2012-09-24 19:21:43
LOL! You're totally right.
I think it's because SHA-0 and SHA-1 were just that - two cryptographic hash functions. Then, starting from SHA-2, they realized that people might have a use for hash functions with different output sizes. So for SHA-2 they created different functions - all within the SHA-2 family - with different output sizes: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512.
This worked because the names didn't interfere with the previous SHA-0 and SHA-1 hash functions. More appropriate names would probably have been SHA-2-256 etc., but people don't like to write long names just to have the nomenclature make sense in the future, so SHA-256 was used because it didn't conflict with anything previous and was faster to write.
Perhaps now we will *need* to call them SHA-2-256 or SHA-3-512 etc., to avoid confusion.

The point is that money and land don't work the same way. You need a certain amount of land per person. It's as simple as that. But the only requirement for money is that the amount left for people to trade with is sufficiently divisible. You don't need x bitcoins per person, only x number of indivisible units per person. Someone could buy up 50% of all bitcoins, and leave them on a computer somewhere, and the only result would be a higher price per bitcoin and nothing else.

Think of one trillion completely unique boulders, that all lie in the same place. Let's say a desert. Each boulder represents one undivisible monetary unit. On each boulder is engraved a code - a key - which determines who the owner is of the monetary unit that is represented by the boulder. When someone "sends" you one or more of these monetary units, the owner's key is removed from the boulder and replaced with your personal key. You can only decide which key to engrave into the boulder if your key is the one that is presently on the boulder. It's impossible to engrave a new key into the boulder - to transfer ownership of the monetary unit that the boulder represents - if you can't prove that you own the key that is presently engraved into the boulder. (This is achieved using public/private key cryptography.)
Now instead of having to go to the location where the boulders are to check who owns which boulder - monetary unit - Bitcoin uses the "block chain", which is a collection of all the monetary units in existence, and who owns which. The block chain is publicly available (just as anyone can go to that place in the desert where all the boulders are), and anyone can confirm at any time which monetary units belong to which keys.
This is a metaphor that can give a general picture of how Bitcoin works on the functional level. So when a bitcoin is "sent", it really doesn't go anywhere. The only thing that is sent is a message *that can only be produced by the person who owns the key currently assocaited with the monetary unit in question*, and everyone can verify (using public/private key cryptography) that this message indeed originates from the owner of the key, and we all mutually agree to replace the key of the sender with whichever key he chooses to replace it with (the key of the receiver).
A wallet is simply a collection of keys. A user can have as many keys as he wants. And as long as he can keep these keys a secret, he has ownership of the bitcoins that are currently associated with they keys in question.

The transfer of debt as a way of payment seems like it holds quite a lot more dangers than when, for example, transferring bitcoins.

Every single transaction you complete is recorded in the so called "block chain" (you can view it on blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com). If your transaction is not in the block chain, it doesn't exist as far as everyone else is concerned. The block chain proves that you sent X BTC from address A to B. So when you cash out from Mt. Gox to address A it's recorded in the block chain, and when you transfer your bitcoins from address A to B, and B to C and so on and so forth, it's all recorded for posterity. It's trivial to follow the coins around.

Agreed. I do think Bitcoin is a bigger step up from credit cards than HD DVD is from regular DVDs though. The latter is basically just "more of the same".

Other than that, I think HD DVDs would have been huge if they came out 10 years ago. HD is huge in porn, so it definitely succeeded there. The internet just proved to be a better medium for transferring information than a plastic disc is.

That depends. Your stocks can be confiscated easily. If you have physical gold coins in your house, it'd actually take someone to break down your door and steal them from you (provided they can find them). I would still suggest buying physical gold coins *with cash* and making sure you keep them in a place where no one will find them.
I mean, I agree with you that stocks are a better investment - gold isn't an investment at all. It's simply a means to store value. If I lived in Greece, my greatest concern would be the government confiscating my assets, either through inflation or simply by passing a law that says I can't hold foreign stocks or currencies. Without wanting to sound rude, I think it would be naive to assume that this can't be the outcome.

I would presume any valuing of said securities have the default of the issuer factored in. I would at least do so, when deciding on my bid. If a certain user on the forum has stuck to his promises in the past, I'd expect that premium to go down. It's not like they just buy securities from random newbies. The dude in question has almost 4500 posts. That takes some time, and does earn you some credibility in the forums. Plus, he has a picture of himself in his profile (supposedly). Reputation can, among other things, allow a user to borrow money more cheaply than other users, so it's not like he has nothing to lose.
That being said, I understand what you're saying. I'm hesitant to loan out money to *anyone* on the forum, without a heavy premium. And even with that heavy premium I'm not sure I'd do it.

This doesn't sound right. If it took 10 minutes to process 260 blocks when running from a RAM disk it obviously can't be disk IO; it must be something else. Maybe a slow network?
You should try setting up two computers on a LAN. One computer has the full block chain, the other is missing some blocks (and storing the block chain and DB on a RAM disk) to exclude bad network connectivity. Add "connect=&lt;LAN ip&gt;" to your bitcoin.conf and it will only connect to that node.

I guess it's all about betting and mining being a possible source of income (if you win) and bounties being "money out the window" in the sense that you're not going to get them back directly.
I think GLBSE is a much better solution than voluntary "bounties"/donations. Let people buy a stake in your company when they invest. If you invention isn't going to be profitable, maybe it isn't the right thing to do. I mean, curiosity is great, but we all need food on the table.
That being said, I have donated to several projects that I feel are important. But I have no doubt that if I were able to buy shares in a company that, say, would develop an open source exchange platform and try to make money on it, I'd spend a lot more money on funding projects.

Any spend from the multi-signature address requires a signature from both parties. You've deposited bitcoins to this multi-sig address, and this deposit transaction is in the block chain, so it can't be double spent. And any spends from this multi-sig address requires a signature from both ends of the payment channel. 
Before committing bitcoins to the payment channel (multi-sig address), you make sure you get the other party to sign a transaction that sends the entire deposit back to you, but you time lock this transaction, so that it isn't valid until, for example, 5 days from now. You can't use this transaction to withdraw coins from the multi-sig address yet -- because it's time locked -- but it means you are able to withdraw from the multi-sig address when the time lock expires. So that if the other party disappears, you haven't lost anything. You just have to wait 5 days to get your bitcoins back.

Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency, started out no more than 2½ years ago and still in its infancy. Anyone claiming investments in Bitcoin isn't high risk is deluding either themselves, other investors, or both.
In my opinion it's utterly naive to assume that computer software no more than 4 years old (and a lot of it much younger) should replace *any* national currency, much less my private currency reserves.

What prevents double spending is the same as always: the fact that the funding transaction is buried in the block chain. In order for the payment channel to be trustless, the involved parties should wait until the funding transaction(s) have a sufficient number of confirmations.

Do you have some sort of evidence to support the following premise:
*"This behavior should not drive up the price of coins and would go undetected if the daily purchasing volume is kept intentionally low."*
Without knowing much about it, I would think this would definitely drive up the price. There's no reason that only large trades would determine the price. Low volume buys would slowly eat up the low asks, steadily increasing the ask price of Bitcoins. The bids should follow.

This happens because any new transaction you make, references a previous transaction sent to one of your addresses. And so, unless the previous transaction that is referenced contains exactly the amount that you wish to send now, it will be necessary to send only a part of the Bitcoins from the previous transaction to a new address, and send the remaining Bitcoins back to yourself.

Poor article. Sounds like he's writing about something he doesn't know much about.
First of all, FLOPS are useless to the Bitcoin network. It's all integer operations. The "Bitcoin supercomputer" doesn't do FLOPS, it does MIPS, and currently about a total of 6.88×10^10 MIPS.
Protected from quantum computers? 2^128 work? Quantum computers don't even exist yet and yet he's prediction how long it would take for them to "crack a wallet"?
He's talking about "encryption", but Bitcoin doesn't even use encryption. It uses cryptographic hashes and digital signatures.
"A computer would have to do more work than there are stars in the universe just to crack just one wallet."
WTF? How can you compare 'work' and 'stars in the universe'? It makes no sense.
**"*So how much work did you do last night?*"**
"Any situation requiring an upgrade to the network security can be done at a moments notice."
That's just a plain lie. It would require everyone to upgrade their software, maybe even require all miners to change their hardware. It's possible, but not trivial at all.
This article is just plain misinformation.

According to my calculations, Mh/s for the HD 7970 will be 40% more than a HD 5870 at stock core clock (925 MHz for 7970 vs 850 MHz for 5870) and 20% slower than a HD 5970 at stock core clock (725 MHz for HD 5970).
The 7970 has 2048 ALUs, while the 5870 and 5970 have 1600 and 3200 ALUs respectively. I simply arrived at the above results my multiplying the ALU count with the core clock, and comparing these numbers between the 7xxx and 5xxx series.
Of course, being produced on a 28 nm process, compared to the 5xxx's 40 nm process, the 7970 will consume less power than the 5xxx (and 6xxx) series.

OpenCL and CUDA *is* computation only, but it's what you do with the results, after they're been computed by the kernel that is of great importance.
Let's say I want to rent GPU resources in this distributed GPGPU network in order to generate Bitcoins (to take an example we're all familiar with). The GPGPU network kernels can easily compute a SHA256 hash, but:
* 1: how do they know what data to calculate the SHA256 hash of (they need to retrieve this from the internet: OpenCL/CUDA can't do this)
* 2: what do they do with the data that comes out? if it finds a correct block, it needs to submit this to the other nodes
You need something to control the OpenCL/CUDA kernel. And this runs on the CPU.

The program creating the transaction doesn't necessarily need to have the private key, but your argument still stands because unless the program is custom built, it does require it at the moment.
But it doesn't sound unfeasible to me that Mt. Gox, for example, uses a system where a transaction is sent to an external device (that holds the private key) for signing. No reading of the private key is thus allowed by the program running on the computer, yet it is able to get its transactions signed.

Right now Bitcoin is way off the top of the chart. Currently it would take only a couple of millions of dollars in investment to take over the Bitcoin network with computing power.

Hmm. Doesn't this destroy the notion of "the longest chain wins"? Why are they necessary?
@_date: 2011-11-06 20:00:25
Yes, those things. Bitcoin isn't really that different from Dollars or Euros, in that it's a currency and payment providers try to relieve a currency of its deficiencies. Traditional currencies are inherently difficult to move around, Bitcoin isn't. But a lot of the things that apply to traditional currencies also apply to Bitcoin. Chargebacks, for example, I believe is a very necessary feature of a payment system in order for customers to start using it.
A payment provider for Bitcoins will provide anything the Bitcoin protocol itself doesn't provide, basically. The lack of instant transfers is another inherent deficiency of the Bitcoin protocol. Though probably a necessary one. Overcoming this is also necessary in order for merchants to start using a certain form of payment system, I believe. They would abstract away, or completely hide, the idea of "confirmations". Only nerds understand it anyway.

Interesting graph for sure. IMO it's obvious that $3 is way too high for anything sustainable. When we get to $0.03 we'll talk. But for that to happen the amount of transactions needs to rise by about a factor 100 (or the cost of mining would need to become 1/100th of what it is today). 
As far as I can tell (from your own explanation) this graph isn't affected by the price of Bitcoins. It's affected by the cost of mining vs. the number of transactions in the Bitcoin network. And so it doesn't tell us anything about whether Bitcoins have reached a stable price.
But thanks for the graph! I actually think figure is very relevant to the viability of Bitcoin. When transaction fees become relevant, they will need to be larger than this figure. The difference between this figure and the actual transaction fees will what a miner will earn from each fee.

As far as I understand, the propagation of transactions has nothing to do with the protocol as such. It's an entirely different matter.

If I recall correctly, you need to set bit 4 of the SIGHASH flag, which makes the transaction valid in the BCC chain but invalid in the Bitcoin chain.

You should earn upvotes and downvotes when you make posts (ie. pay BTC).
This way, you buy upvotes and downvotes, and for people who aren't spamming (people who are upvoted), votes get cheaper and cheaper, but for spammers they get more and more expensive, assuming people downvote the spammers.
But in reality, the downvote is irrelevant for spammers. Because as soon as they have an account where they have to pay more to post comments, they'll create a new one and start from fresh.
I think it's sufficient to just charge, like, 50 cents for a comment, and if the author of the blog deems your comment non-spam, he can repay you the 50 cent. If it's a spam comment, he won't repay. I don't think any spammers would be willing to pay 50 cent for a single spam comment.

Bitcoin is a distributed timestamping database, so we can't avoid time being part of the consensus rules. But you're right, it's a hard problem. But it seems to work fairly well.
If you have an internet connection, which is required to send a Bitcoin payment in the first place, you can check several time servers and be pretty sure you have the correct time. It's trivial to write a script that polls 100 different time servers, and uses the median as the current time. But no one does that because it doesn't seem to be necessary.
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:45:52


This in incorrect.
In Bitcoin we depend on time directly. Nodes have the current time, and all blocks contain a timestamp, stating the time it was mined. If these two times differ too much, the block is rejected by the node.

I'd argue that there's still a lot of research to be done on SHA256 ASICs. We really only started developing SHA256 ASICs optimized for speed and power usage a couple of years ago.

It's not like CPUs, where we've been developing them for decades.

I think the primary concern is Greece depositors, and their banks who probably also hold some Greek debt.
"Getting out" of the Euro for Greece would entail a lot of Greek losses as well, as Greek banks who've bought Greek government bonds using depositor funds become insolvent and cannot pay back 100% of deposited funds.
Of course, the authorities will probably primarily target holders of larger bank balances, as there aren't as many of these people. But I don't think this attitude bodes well for Greece. They might think they've escaped the Euro, only to find out they didn't escape the actual problem.

I know what bank reserves are. If someone deposits $100 into a bank, and the bank lends out $90, it has $10 left which is part of its reserves.
This does not mean that a bank can lend out $1,000 if someone deposits $100.
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:29:29


This is just plain wrong. A bank can't lend out more money than it has. If you deposit $100, the bank can lend out -- more or less -- $90 of that money.
Now, the trick is that whoever received the $90 might deposit it into the same bank, and now the bank can lend out 90% of that $90, and so it can continue, until around 10 times as much money as the original $100 has been lent out.
But this is an important point. This money creation is a product of asset/liability maturity mismatch. It's the result of using time deposits to fund the purchase of 10-year government bonds.
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:23:10


Yes. That's why it's problematic when bail-ins happen, and depositors lose their savings. I'm only saying that it's not really better or worse than bail-outs. One (bail-ins) destabilizes an already unstable monetary system, and the other (bail-outs) increase the socialization of an already socialized monetary system.


I agree. I don't either. But we have a problem where if we do as you say, and then 80% of the population chooses the uninsured banks, and then they fail, and these people vote for whoever is willing to bail them out. So in the end you may get bail-outs, regardless of whether or not they were legal to begin with. I'm saying perhaps we can avoid this by making insurance mandatory, such that no one ever needs to vote in a politician to bail out their savings.
And at the end of the day, can we really blame people for voting in a pro-bail-out politician if the question concerns their life savings? It's easy to tell people to let go of their life savings and forget about it, but in reality these people won't do that without resistance, and sine we live in a democracy, perhaps it's just better to avoid this situation in the first place, by making deposit insurance mandatory. Perhaps. I'm not saying it is, but it think we at least ought to consider it.
Of course, this problem wouldn't even exist under a free monetary system, so my point is moot.

No problem. I like to know how to explain stuff properly, so I appreciate the feedback.
The multisig address is actually both a multisig address *plus* it has this added "expiration date" property. So it's a P2SH address, which allows us to add both multisig and stuff like expiration date. Funds sent to this P2SH address have two possible ways to be spent:
1. By providing both server and client signatures
2. After the expiration date: only the client signature (usually only used if the server disappears)
So this means it's a requirement that the server publish the settlement transaction before the expiration date (preferably well before). Otherwise you are completely right: the client can get all the value back. When the server publishes the settlement transaction it makes the refund transaction worthless, because the output, that the refund transaction spends/redeems, will then be spent by the settlement transaction.

Hi there
Let me try to answer your questions.


Not exactly. With this server you can build your own Lightning Network. But that's not the purpose. The purpose is if you have something to sell for bitcoins, and you want to save fees on *repeated payments* from a client, then you can set up this server, have the client connect to it, receive as many payments as you want, and only pay the Bitocoin transaction fee one time, when you're done.
 &gt; It's in clear or all communication are encrypted ?
It's a HTTP/web server so it can be secured with HTTPS, which is recommended. HTTP (without encryption) is really only for testing.


The server is basically a building block for receiving payments, not a decentralized network in itself. So you could imagine building a decentralized network *out of* nodes like this server, but in itself it's just a server that is able to receive payment channel payments from a client. It is assumed that the server has something to offer that the client wants to buy.


My pleasure :)

@_date: 2016-07-29 16:44:10


You are very welcome!


When two businesses, like a retailer and a supplier, are in a relationship, it's because they trust each other, I would argue. Suppliers usually aren't able to demand payment up front for the goods they deliver, because most other suppliers are willing to deliver on credit, so to speak, ie. wait for payment until the retailer has sold the good. It's very inefficient if companies had to save up money in order to buy supplies, because each time we add a new link in the supply chain, this company, too, would have to save up money to buy supplies. This doesn't scale.
Generally speaking, if the sale can take place without trustlessness, that's preferred, because it's a lot cheaper and it scales better. So I don't think this trustless protocol will taker over where the seller doesn't demand trustlessness, because it adds both cost and complexity.
This protocol is made for trustless, instant transactions where the payment receiver doesn't trust the sender. The bitcoin-receiver has something the sender wants (a video, an article, etc.), but the receiver is not willing to send it in exchange for credit, only bitcoins.

Hah! Yeah, I think there's a balance between adaptability and reaching this *functional pearl*-like property, though. It's nice to set things in stone, but it also needs to be able to adapt. Pearls are pretty, but not very adaptable.


Awesome! Note that some of the code base is fairly old, and not relevant any longer. So avoid, for example, the `BlockchainAPI` module. I have a bitcoind-based address-to-transaction service now ( which replaces the Blockchain REST APIs in `BlockchainAPI`, but I haven't implemented the client API in the server yet. The `Common` module is also fairly old, and doesn't really serve its purpose any more (most of the common stuff is in `PayChanServer` (which was recently split into three)).
I should probably take a day in the near future to just clean it up a bit.


So far I just have a way to test that a payment session (open a channel; make *n* payments; close), works. I'm not exactly sure how to write tests for this, probably because I'm not really used to creating a lot of tests; they only really appear if I feel uncertain about whether something works or not (if it reaches sufficient complexity). I would highly welcome tests written against the specification of the API (
I know I would like to write a test against the service which checks for close-to-expiring channels at some point. More tests are always nice, but the motivation to write tests, for me, really only is there if I can't look at the code and feel like I know whether it works or not.
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:34:53


No, the inverse: it only makes sense to use this if you don't trust the buyer. As says, the double spend problem is solved by the funding address requiring the receiver's signature too, to spend from it.
So funds are sent to a 2-of-2 multisig address, so the client can't send from that address without the server's consent. Until the channel expiration date has passed, after which the client can redeem the funds (making it trustless).

This demonstrates a misunderstanding of how money works. "Not enough money" is not an issue as long as it's sufficiently divisible. Prices just rise.
The only choice you're left with is whether the results of increased efficiency in the economy goes to holders of currency or producers of currency. In a hard money-system, increased efficiency in production benefits the holders of currency through deflation. In a system of elastic money, increased efficiency in production benefits the producers of currency instead.
The increased wealth *has* to go somewhere. It doesn't just disappear because you print more money, it's simply transferred, primarily, to banks and those closely connected to the banks.

@_date: 2013-04-12 18:49:03
The way I understand it is that Mt Gox, for example, could become a "gateway" on the Ripple network. You would then fund your Mt. Gox account as you do usually, but Mt. Gox wouldn't have its own order book. The BTCUSD order book would exist in a decentralized manner within the Ripple network.
So if Mt. Gox trusts Bitstamp, for example, a Bitstamp user with 100 USD in his account - which we will call bitstampUSD - wants to buy 1 BTC at 100 USD each. If Mt. Gox trusts Bitfloor, they can exchange dollars between themselves, thus enabling users to trade across exchanges. 
For example, the user Bob on Bitstamp has 100 USD in his Bitstamp account. These USD are represented as bitsstampUSD within the Ripple network (a currency in and of itself in the Ripple network). Another user, Alice, has 1 BTC on her Mt. Gox account. This is represented as mtgoxBTC within the Ripple network. If Mt. Gox and Bitstamp trust each other, that means they think their respective currencies are good, ie. that mtgoxUSD, bitstampUSD, mtgoxBTC etc. are valid IOUs. So when Bob wants to buy 1 BTC for 100 USD, he will put a bid order on the book, and if Alice puts a ask on the book, selling 1 BTC for 100 USD, Mt. Gox can exchange their 1 mtgoxBTC from Alice's account with the 100 bitstampUSD from Bob's account, and a trade has happened. Mt. Gox and Bitstamp would then periodically (at the end of the day, for example) settle their outstanding debt (Mt. Gox would redeem bitstampUSD for actual USD and bitstampBTC for actual BTC and vice versa).
Thus, the usual actors - Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, Bitfloor, bitcoin-24.com, BTE-e.com, etc. - would be reduced to entities transferring fiat money to each other within the Ripple network, and we would effectively have a decentralized exchange, where only single actors can be DDoS'ed. Since the order book is maintained in a decentralized manner, it cannot disappear because of a DDoS, and the exchanges that are able to withstand DDoS attacks would get the trades when Mt. Gox is down, thus increasing the incentive for the exchanges to protect themselves against DDoS attacks.

That doesn't make sense to miners since the effort to handle a huge and tiny transaction are equal. Bitcoin really isn't made for micro payments.

I use an offline Armory wallet, it's really the best it gets. Buy an old laptop, install Armory on it, rip out the Wifi card and create your offline wallet. Then you can use Armory on your online computer to manage an online wallet that you only keep change in.

As far as I can see, a problem with this is that insurance is designed to handle a few cases of something very costly happen to individuals.
What if 70% of your users have their money in blockchain.info's e-wallets and it gets hacked.
For this to work, users' funds need to be separated from each other, so that one person being hacked doesn't raise the risk of other being hacked as well.
This is the reason that insurance companies don't cover events classified as a *force majeure*.

Gox doesn't need to do this. By accepting fiat deposits from and withdrawals to other exchanges, Mt. Gox would trust their ability to make good on that debt and vice versa. If Mt. Gox can't settle with customers, why would they be able to settle with other exchanges? A huge debt would build up for Mt. Gox, owed to other exchanges who *can* move fiat. I wouldn't be too interested in accepting Mt. Gox' IOUs if I were a big exchange, although the market (or at least 50% of it) seems to be.

That's like asking whether phone calls should be charged after the duration of the call, or after how many words you exchange with the person on the other end of the line. If you start a phone company charging according to the latter, you'll be out of business fairly soon.
They're charged per minute because that's the finite resource you're using when you're talking on the phone: you're occupying a connection on the phone network with another phone; that's what's in limited supply.
Similarly, the limited supply in bitcoin is space, and - currently - block size limit (1 MB).

I don't think that should be the case. The rating of a bitcoin-denominated bond shouldn't be related to bitcoin's perceived risk. Just as the rating of a USD or GBP-denominated bond isn't related to the viability of said currency. Mainly because assessing the risk of bitcoin (as well as most currencies) collapsing is near impossible before after the fact. Also, the currency in which a bond is denominated in crashing doesn't impact the issuers ability to pay back his debt. In fact, if the currency become worthless the debitor will have no problems paying back the debt (in now worthless currency).

OP is right. The transaction in question is a "generation transaction" (also called a "coinbase transaction"), which has no content in the scriptSig field, because it's not redeeming an output from an existing transaction. This field is called the "coinbase" field in a generation transaction, and it can contain various information. In this transaction it contains a quote from a newspaper.
A block consists of a header and transaction data. The genesis block consists of a header, and a single generation transaction, and the generation transaction contains this message.

For the long term I would just buy BTC. ASICMINER is overpriced currently. There is too much competition appearing for them to continue paying as much in dividends as they've done so far.
My target price for ASICMINER in 6 months is less than 1 BTC per share.


Difficulty rising will put a *downward* pressure on earnings, not upward. It makes mining harder, and decreases the value of mining hardware.


Short term (1-2 months) you might be able to make some money investing in ASICMINER, but it's *very* risky.
Long term, the price of ASICMINER shares is going down, I think.
*Full disclosure: I bought 10 ASICMINER shares at 1.9 BTC/share and just sold them at 4.3 BTC/share.*

@_date: 2016-07-29 17:50:39
Your first two points are correct.
3.: The funds are in a 2-of-2 multisig address, requiring both the server's and the client's signature to spend from it. So the client can't send the funds anywhere else by itself, and neither can the server.
4.: Instead of billing, the client would just sent the X satoshi's when the server requests them. So you would need to make a protocol that sends video in response to payments.
Only the server really has the power to close the channel, but the client can just refuse to make more payments, and wait until the expiration date, so the server has no reason not to close the channel when the client wants. All funds sent over the channel will be "locked in the channel", so to speak, until it is closed. And closing the channel means that you publish a Bitcoin transaction to the network that spends from this 2-of-2 multisig address, sending the amount you received to your own address and the rest to the client's change address.
The actual payment sent over the channel is created by the client constructing a Bitcoin transaction that redeems this 2-of-2 multisig outout (the channel funding address), decrementing its own change value by the payment amount, signing this transaction and sending the resulting signature plus new client value to the server. Then the server just "plugs" this signature+new value into the same transaction, and it can add its own output to the transaction (because it uses ANYONECANSPEND) and publish it to the network when the client is done sending new payments.

@_date: 2013-08-12 06:24:38
Then how do you explain the price on Mt. Gox being 10% higher than all the other exchanges?
Did traders suddenly become uninterested in arbitrage?
This friction in moving fiat out of Mt. Gox has ramped up the price considerably. This has happened because you can't really buy USD with your bitcoins on Mt. Gox, only a promise of delivery of USD in the future.
Here's a chart comparing the USD Bitstamp price with the USD Mt. Gox price: 
I've overlaid the two graphs on a log scale, so it shows the percentage differences. They were practically non-existant before Mt. Gox started having trouble making withdrawals.
Also, look at what exchange rate Bitpay is using: 
Right now Bitstamp is trading at 94.09 and Mt. Gox is at 104.2 and Bitpay is quoting a 93.8 exchange rate. Mt. Gox' 10% higher exchange rate is useless because you can't actually get that for your bitcoins, because withdrawals aren't working properly. So Bitpay can't use the Mt. Gox exchange rate for anything, and neither can we.

You can tell by looking at the basis - the difference between the spot price of gold and the futures price.

I started learning Visual Basic, way back, then learned C and later Python. Once you know a single programming language it's fairly easy to pick up another one.
I've done a lot of Bitcoin stuff in Python. The only downside is speed. But the remedy for that is writing the performance-crucial parts in C or C++ and using Python's C or C++ interface. Python is really an awesome language. Not the least because there are so many modules already created for you. Just `import &lt;whatever&gt;` and you can create a web server in 10 lines of code.
@_date: 2013-05-28 14:38:08
As luckyhash mentions the difference is in latency. Not throughput.
An SSD is roughly as fast as a HDD in throughput. A HDD can get perhaps 100 MB/s, and most SSDs are in that area too (perhaps up to 300 MB/s).
But the latency, also called the access time, which is the time it takes from the moment you ask to read a certain piece of data, until you get it, is about 100 times faster for an SSD (around 0.1 ms) than it is for a HDD (around 10 ms).
This is what makes all the difference.
This is also, partly, why RAM is so fast. It has an access time of around 10 nanoseconds (0.00001 ms). Of course, it also has a high throughput (gigabytes per second), but the latency is what really makes it snappy.

There are no rules of a block chain. A block chain stores data. The program running on the computer decides what "the block chain" actually constitutes.

Because the target is encoded using a packed format in block headers. This means it only uses 4 bytes instead of the 32 bytes needed to encode the full number. The downside is that you don't get a full 256 bits of precision: 
Please note that the difference between these two numbers is *very* small. The number with the trailing zeros is 99.9984741% the value of the number with the trailing F's (1 bits).
So we save 28 bytes in each block header, and only lose a tiny fraction of a percentage in accuracy.

This is not a "hack", per se. The media sometimes reports DDoS attacks as "hacks", but that's a bit confusing. A DDoS attack is basically just sending huge amounts of a traffic to a server, which saturates the server's Internet connection, and means that legitimate requests can't get through. That's all. Nothing is stolen, the server isn't compromised; attackers are just flooding it with data, meaning regular users can't get to the server.

Several things make it more complicated. 
1. There is no USD column. The price in USD is contained in a text string in a field
2. Buys aren't denoted with a positive value and sells with a negative value. This has to be extacted from the value of another cell. (so if I buy 2 BTC at $5 and sell 1 BTC at $5.1 and then buy 1.02 BTC at $5 again it's hard to calculate the average price)
3. Buying in multiple currencies makes it more complicated because I have to factor in the exchange rate at the time of purchase (added to this is the fact that EUR orders place the currency symbol *after* the price while USD orders place it before the price)

Can you explain this a bit more? If a person pays back a loan to a bank, that money isn't destroyed, it's just with the bank now. The bank is free to use it in whatever way it wishes - it's that bank's money now - and it will probably not sit in a vault/account, but probably buy bonds or other assets with it (which is why we've seen the huge bull market in bonds in Japan).
The only way to destroy money that is debt-based is through default. When a bank loans out money to an individual or corporation, and it defaults, the money is gone. If it pays back the money instead, it's just transferred to the creditor; no money is destroyed.
Similarly, debt-based money can't be destroyed by buying gold. You simply transfer the debt to whomever you're buying the gold from.

Now it costs $300. If Bitcoin takes 20 years to become this data-heavy, I reckon it'll be fine.

If a competent journalist had written this piece, he would have done some research, and found [this]( page on Mt. Gox' site, explaining that SEPA withdrawals take three weeks or so to complete, and international wire transfers take "more than 4 weeks to process".
This means that Mt. Gox is not a BTCUSD or BTCEUR spot market, because they do not offer immediate delivery of either US Dollars or Euros. So Mt. Gox is effectively a BTCUSD and BTCEUR futures market, which explains the higher price.

Most people don't agree on that. My impression is people are split 50/50-ish. I, myself, don't think a group was needed to design Bitcoin. Once the idea of using proof-of-work to secure the blockchain is done, all an intelligent programmer really needs is time. It took Satoshi two years before a workable version was released.

You still have the problem of Litecoin's inadequate market depth.
At the same time you lose the decentralized aspect, since an exchange cannot be done without a trusted third party.
All in all you're increasing your risk. Before there was a single party (the merchant who you're buying a product from), and now there are two parties: the merchant and the person you're buying litecoin/bitcoin from.
I don't see any advantage of using both Litecoin and Bitcoin in this scenario. Sure, it can be worked around, no doubt about that, but I'm questioning the utility of having two competing, and almost identical, crypto currencies, not whether there's a way to reduce the added cost associated with having two competing crypto currencies.

The reason silver and gold have co-existed for thousands of years does not apply to Bitcoin and Litecoin, in my opinion.
The strength of gold is *marketability in the large*. This means that you can buy or sell $1bn worth of gold, and it will hardly result in the price changing at all. *But* the spread (difference between purchase and sell price) for *small amounts* of gold is too high to invest, say, 10% of your monthly wage in; you will simply lose too much money because of the large spread for small amounts.
This is where silver comes in, or *came in*. Silver is for *marketability in the small*. The spread for a $200 worth of silver is much less than that of an equivalent amount of gold, which allows savers to spend 10% of their monthly wage on silver, and at the end of the year exchange it into gold, thereby circumventing the high spread of gold at small amounts.
This does not describe the relationship between Bitcoin and Litecoin. Bitcoin is as marketable in small amounts as it is in large amounts.

I disagree. I think it's a completely acceptable policy. A company not knowing whether the money it has received for orders will be there in a month can be a real problem. It increases operating costs, and harms customers if someone pulls a large order.

The offline laptop is definitely a good idea. Make sure you pull out the Wifi card before generating your private key.
I would recommend Armory for the offline wallet though. People have lost a significant number of bitcoins from doing manual paper backups using Bitcoin Qt. Armory makes sure you don't have to understand change addresses etc.

It's been at 10% for quite some time now. Risk is quantified in terms of percent. So if the price went to $200 on Bitstamp it would have to go to $220 on Mt. Gox, unless people think the risk of not being able to withdraw USD from Mt. Gox has changed.

Please give us a hypothetical example of such an attack. I think the point is that if you find such a serious flaw in the Bitcoin code, bitcoin *will* drop to zero, and all the bitcoins you've just stolen/retrieved have zero value.
Even if it has value, how are you going to get it out? Every exchange has withdrawal limits, and if a serious attack was mounted, it's quite likely that exchanges would suspend withdrawals until it's figured out.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's *impossible* to make money from a flaw in the Bitcoin code. I'm just saying I think it's not as profitable as many people think it would be, because of the above reasons.

You have a point, and I think the mainstream economists are quite schizophrenic with regards to this point.
On the one hand they say: *inflation encourages spending because your money is worth less tomorrow, so you better spend now.*
Then when one interjects that this is simply unfair, that banks get to transfer wealth from my savings and over to them, they say: *oh but you can just put your money in a bank account an earn interest. That way you don't lose money!*
So which is it? If the latter point holds true, that would nullify the effect of the former point (since most people store their money in a bank account). If people aren't getting poorer (which is what they seem to want), why would they spend money now rather than later?

Why would I care whether a merchant converts hit bitcoins into something else after accepting it as payment from me?
Your claim is:


I don't see how using Bitpay as a payment processor means they're not accepting BTC. They clearly are. I bought some gold the other day for my bitcoins. Worked great. I presume they converted that to dollars because they need to pay their supplier in USD. But why should I care about what they convert it to after they receive it?
Similarly, I live in Denmark where we use the Danish Krone (DKK). This means that any Danish company that deals with a foreign customer, who probably pays either in USD or EUR, has to convert that money to DKK to pay their employees, pay taxes, insurance etc. But why would that matter to the USD or EUR that a company accepting it as payment has to convert it into another currency? As far as I can see it's completely irrelevant for the buyer and the currency in question.

No it's not. The issue is that Zerocoin transactions are 50 KB in size, and require a 0.5 second verification time. 
So, in other words, if all Bitcoin transactions used Zerocoin, the blockchain would be at least 800GB in size, instead of 8GB, and take a month to verify, instead of 6 hours.

The important difference between the Bitcoin network and Mt. Gox is that the former is decentralized and the latter is centralized. It's much easier to perform tens of thousands of transactions in a centralized environment - check out LMAX - but Mt. Gox handles only 35. I'm not aware of any decentralized system that can handle more than the 7 TPS that Bitcoin can currently (which *is* just an artificial limit, it can handle more than that if the peers comprising the network has enough bandwidth and storage space).

Remember that bids are always lower than asks. Bids are low, asks are high. A bid is someone saying "I'm willing to pay *x* for one unit of the base currency". An asks is someone saying "I'm willing to sell one unit of the base currency for *y*". If a bid is higher than or equal to an ask, you have a match: someone (the bidder) is willing to pay at least the price offered by an ask (the seller). Thus we have a trade, and neither the bid or ask is placed on the order book.
In the screenshot you can see what [currency pair]( is being traded. In this case it's **XBT/EUR**. The currency symbol to the left (XBT) is the **base currency** (and the symbol on the right is the **counter currency**).
Bids and asks are always relative to the **base currency** (hence its name).
The question is: "how much counter currency does one unit of the base currency cost?".

If miners earn more money because the value of bitcoin goes up, they don't need to charge as much in fees, and can afford to include transactions with smaller fees.
There's nothing static about this. The miners that don't change their fee structure based on the BTC price will miss out on revenue generated from fees. So someone will step up to the plate if they feel your transaction is valuable enough.
That being said, the fee determination process needs work. We still need an effective way for miners to communicate which fees they require to process your transaction.

Some central website should never be the source of ticker information.

No, not really. A crashing price is a *symptom* of a currency with a low market depth. If a currency has low market depth, it *will* crash occasionally. The bitcoin price will continue to crash, and - if it succeeds - the goal is reached when the crashes are only as big as those of gold (10% in a day).
TL;DR: Buy whenever you want, sell whenever you want. Nothing is gained from pretending bitcoin is not a volatile asset right now. If bitcoin remains useful, its price volatility will decrease without us needing to do anything.

It should be possible to create a meta exchange though, that has funds on all the major exchanges, and then aggregates all the order books from these exchanges into a single one, and simply executes your trade at whichever exchange(s) that has the best price.
It would take, first of all, a lot of risk-willing capital, because all the supported exchanges need to be loaded with both fiat and BTC, and also a very intelligent trading engine that needs to keep an eye on whether a certain trade actually executes on the exchange in question, and if not, moves it to another exchange.

I've been thinking about such a system. As far as I can see, it would be a matter of having miners publish blocks with a hash that is higher than the current target by some factor, for example 600, so we get a block every ~1 second.
At least in the beginning, I imagine this would happen on a separate P2P network, so we don't clog up the Bitcoin P2P network with this information, at least initially.
The cool thing about this is that it would give *instant* feedback on whether a miner is working on your transaction. At least that's what I imagine. I'm not quite sure how long the lag between a miner receiving a transaction, and it being added to the list of transactions being mined on actually is.
This would really be the ultimate feedback mechanism, as I see it. You would be able to very quickly adjust fees, if you really want your transaction included in the next block. You wouldn't be clueless for ~10 minutes, and subsequently need to adjust fees, if your transaction doesn't show up in the next block.
The most complicated part of this system is how to make it as low-bandwidth as possible. The other part that will prove difficult - but perhaps unnecessary - is how to compensate miners for participating. Perhaps the increased efficiency of fee discovery is enough to make miners participate?

I think Greshman's law applies to currencies where the price is fixed by government. So I don't think it will apply to a floating exchange rate currency like Bitcoin.
The way Gresham's law works is when a certain money is price-fixed, it will either drive out that money, or its competitor, depending on whether the price fix is below or above the market price.
For example: when the Coinage Act of 1792 declared the legal exchange rate of silver-to-gold to be 15:1, and the actual market exchange rate is 15.5:1, then this act has actually made silver more valuable than it is, and it will drive out the "good money" gold. This is because one can buy 15.5 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold in, for example, Canada, and bring it to the US and buy an ounce of gold and have half an ounce of silver left (the law requires that when exchanging gold for silver, the government-fixed exchange rate must be used).
Of course, no one holding gold is willing to enter into this exchange, and thus, the action of exchange rate-fixing, drives out the undervalued money.

No, he'd rather trade with bitcoins - that have predictable monetary inflation - than with another digital coin with unpredictable inflation.
I would too. And I think a lot of other people would as well. Thus, an exchange rate would simply be established by the market between the two currencies (bitcoin vs. the other digital coin with unpredictable inflation), and all parties can trade with each other by first converting their currency to the one that the other party accepts.

Both Bitcoin and Litecoin are experiments. I think it's healthy to have experiments.
Once several centuries ago when everyone was using gold as money, a huge reserve of gold was found in California, making the price (purchasing power) of gold plummet.

That's understandable. The site does a very poor job of explaining it.
A contract is created that depends on an event. For example:


If the event turns out to be true, the contract is worth 10 mBTC. If it turns out false, the contract is worth 0 mBTC.
If you *buy* such a contract for its current buying price (9 mBTC) and the event turns out to be true, you earn 1 mBTC for every contract you've bought (because the contract will be worth 10 mBTC and you've bought it for 9 mBTC). If it turns out to be false, you've lost the 9 mBTC you've bought the contract for because it'll be worth 0 mBTC.
If you *sell* such a contract for its current sell price (0.65 mBTC), then you earn 0.65 mBTC immediately. If the event turns out to be true, you owe the buyer 10 mBTC per contract, meaning you've lost 10-0.65 mBTC per contract. If the event turns out to be false, the contract is worth 0 mBTC and you've earned 0.65 mBTC per contract you've sold.

Oh, right. I stand corrected.
But, what if we define a function that returns *two* points. In the above graph, the places where we only have a single point on the curve, the returned point is simply outside of the view of the graph area. Couldn't such a function map to the above graph? (Or perhaps make that up to *n* points, to cover the fireworks explosion pattern).

This is a strange scenartio, but it's true. If everybody instantly spent every bitcoin they have on USD, the price would indeed drop to zero, denominated in USD. Bear in mind that this would mean that all buyers of bitcoins would also sell the bitcoins they've just bought, ie. those who bought bitcoins from a seller would afterwards sell it for USD (if this isn't the case, the statement doesn't make sense). So we can see that in this hypothetical situation, the USD price *would* indeed drop to zero. Remember that whenever someone sells his bitcoins for USD, someone else must buy them, and if we state that "everybody instantly spends every coin they have", then the buyers of the bitcoins would also have to sell them, continuing a downwards spiral until we reach zero.
If everybody withheld all their bitcoins for USD, the price would instantly go to infinity. Ie. it wouldn't be possible to buy bitcoins for USD; the bitcoin's bid on USD would disappear.

The important question is this: how much of these 15 mBTC per share from mining does ASICMiner need to reinvest in order to keep their current ~25% network share?
[freidcat has stated that they pay less than $10,000 per TH]( So if we use 1.28% as the daily difficulty increase (average from the last 10 difficulty adjustments), and we assume ASICMiner has 35 TH deployed right now (7-day average from  then they need to add 35 TH * 9.3% to their hashing capacity this week, in order to retain their current network share. That's 3.25 TH per week, for this week *only* (next week it will be (35+3.25) * 9.3% = 3.56 TH). Assuming a cost of $10k per TH, that's (using an exchange rate of $85/BTC) 382 BTC deducted from dividends, or around 0.001 BTC per share this week.
So the number of TH that ASICMiner needs to add to its capacity will grow each week, as the network grows. Until ASICMiner has their new chips ready (which friedcat [has said will be October at the earliest]( which will bring down the price per TH significantly, adding new capacity will continue to eat away more and more at the mining revenue.
Perhaps hardware sales can cancel this out, though. But costs to maintain current network share *will* increase, as long as they are operating with current technology.
So let's try to calculate how much ASICMiner will have to spend on adding capacity to the network, assuming the 9.3% increase in network speed that we used before. friedcat has said October at the earliest for new hardware. So let's assume their new hardware is ready in the beginning of December, to give them some leeway. That's 5 months from now, or 21 weeks.
9.3% per week for 21 weeks is 647%. 647% of 35 TH is 227 TH. At a price of $10k per TH - assuming $80/BTC - that's 28,314 BTC they need to spend to maintain their 25% network share until December. That's 1348 BTC per week, or 0.00337 BTC per share, distributed out over all the 21 weeks (it will affect the weeks closer to December more than it will affect dividends now). So if we deduct this figure from the 15 mBTC current dividend from mining alone, that's 11.6 mBTC.
The great unknown in calculating this is, of course, the BTCUSD exchange rate. The more it falls the more it will eat away at the dividend, since ASICMiner pays for their chips in USD.

Please elaborate on this. What is your primary operating system? Do you have a swap partition on your hard drive?


Please elaborate here as well. What were the exact steps you took? Did you open MultiBit, export the wallet, edit the exported wallet to contain your private key, then import the exported (but modified) wallet?
As others have said, back up all data from both your hard drive and the USB stick.
After doing that, try booting up the Live CD again and look at the content of */proc/swaps*. If you're lucky the original wallet file was written to the swap partition at some point, and it might be recoverable.

I just spoke with him on IRC. He says you have to provide the OTP when withdrawing via the API, if OTP is enabled for withdrawal:
    [14:49:46] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: Are you aware of the fact that when enabling OTP for an account, it defaults to *not* enabling it for the Security Center? This effectively means that an attacker can create an API key through which he can trade and withdraw funds while the user is logged in. It seems a Redditor just got her coins stolen this way: 
    [14:49:49] &lt;Title&gt; [ PSA: I had $480 stolen out of my Mt.Gox account this morning despite having 2 factor identification. Here is what happened... : Bitcoin ]
    [14:50:56] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: The simple fix would be to enable OTP for Security Center as soon as a user enabled OTP for his account. Enabling it by default to only "Withdraw" doesn't make much sense when an attacker can create an API key in the security center through which he can withdraw.
    [14:51:33] &lt;Plarkplark&gt; :\
    [14:51:37] &lt;Plarkplark&gt; wow this is scary
    [14:52:13] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; runeks: if you buy a yubikey, it's enabled correctly
    [14:52:38] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: That's good. And the way it should be. But don't you agree that the same should happen with Google Authenticator?
    [14:52:58] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; Google Auth has no standard creation process, you choose yourself to what it should be enabled
    [14:53:33] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; also, even if an API key can "withdraw", you still need to provide the withdraw otp when calling the API
    [14:54:13] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: Hmm... So you're saying Mt. Gox is unable to activate OTP for Security Center access by default, when enabling Google Authenticator OTP for an account?
    [14:54:36] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; there is no such thing as "enabling Google Authenticator OTP for an account"
    [14:54:48] &lt;runeks&gt; Oh...
    [14:56:11] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: But couldn't the Mt. Gox site be designed so that this is the case? But then again, if you have to provide OTP when withdrawing via the API this means that it doesn't really matter.
    [15:00:38] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: So the API authentication process is described here: 
    [15:00:41] &lt;Title&gt; [ MtGox/API/HTTP - Bitcoin ]
    [15:00:42] &lt;bittrader&gt; I use Google Authenticator on my account
    [15:00:51] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: Where in that process does it ask for an OTP when withdrawing?
    [15:00:53] &lt;bittrader&gt; and it asks for the code everytime I try to create a API key
    [15:01:05] &lt;runeks&gt; bittrader: That's because you have OTP enabled for the Security Center.
    [15:01:06] &lt;bittrader&gt; I'm quite happy with the level of security on my account
    [15:01:17] &lt;runeks&gt; It doesn't default to that.
    [15:09:35] &lt;sturles&gt; runeks: If you have otp enabled for withdrawal, you can't withdraw through the API without providing a correct OTP as argument.
    [15:11:01] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; [22:00:51] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: Where in that process does it ask for an OTP when withdrawing? &lt;- only when you call withdrawing apis
    [15:11:27] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; btw if you talk about the guy who posted on reddit, we checked and he added the google auth otp after being hacked
    [15:25:10] &lt;runeks&gt; MagicalTux: It's a girl and it happened yesterday. Are you talking about her? Or someone from earlier?
    [15:25:23] &lt;runeks&gt; Good to know that you're sensible and don't allow withdrawal via API when OTP for withdrawal is enabled.

Cool! I looked at the `since` parameter but I couldn't figure out how to get the trade_id. It's not a timestamp, as far as I can see.
I can see now that it appears to be an incrementing integer used to identify each trade. That's pretty useless for looking at trades for a specific time period.
And it seems to only return a small time period, less than 24 hours. So I'd have to bang the API pretty hard to get data for only a specific time period.
Anyway, the data from bitcoincharts.com seems to agree with the Mt. Gox data for the past 24 hours at least. Seems trustworthy.
**EDIT:** Just found out the `tid` value is the timestamp in microseconds. That's pretty cool. Looks like it's usable if I can stich together data from multiple requests.

There are two ways to determine when a block was found. Neither is necessarily accurate. The first way is to use the "timestamp" field in the block itself. This timestamp field is embedded into the block header by the miner that mines the block. This is essentially "the time on the mining computer". If the computer that does the mining doesn't have its clock set right, this can deviate substantially from the actual time.
The other way is to note when your node, that receives the block from other nodes, received the block in question. This is usually more accurate as blocks travel pretty fast through the network.
Using the latter method, block 230098 was generated (received) 9 seconds after block 230097.
Using the timestamp, however, 3 minutes and 44 seconds elapsed between those two blocks.
The most probably explanation is that the miner of one of those blocks has been running for a very long time, without synchronizing its clock to the actual time, and it has drifted to differ almost 4 minutes from actual time.
So, in short, the reason no transactions were included in that block is probably that only 9 seconds had elapsed after the previous block was found.

You need to perform some fairly complex EC math in order to calculate the public key from the private key. The private key actually is the above, 1e089e3c5323ad80a90767bdd5907297b4138163f027097fd3bdbeab528d2d68, but the base58 notation is often used instead. The base58 notation of this number is 5J3WkX9oUqwxzefZyhTvanrEjLni1tKk6Ya55AoQX6Hrd7U9Y4E. The corresponding address is 13YXiHAXcR7Ho53aExeHMwWEgHcBaAD7Zk. You can use this site to calculate it.

Thanks! Just what I was looking for.
Although, after I found out about the Euro debacle, which means I need to convert a Euro price to USD and thus retrieve the EURUSD exchange rate for each date of purchase, I decided to just track down each bank transfer I have made that was used to purchase bitcoins for (less than 5). Then I calculated just how many BTCs I have bought in total, and divided it by the total amount I have transferred. Turns out I've paid an average of 6.45 USD/BTC.

Trades are leveraged, so yes, you can. It's also easier to lose money because of the high volatility. If you're leveraged 10x, and bitcoin is at 220 and goes down to below 198, you lose everything because your position is force-closed. But you also earn $10 for every $1 the BTCUSD goes up in price.
Here's a picture of my positions at my test account, two hours after I opened them: 
It's +£380, with a 10,000 fictiontal GBP open position. Note that the spread is 10.0 currently, so as soon as you have bought or sold a contract, you're 10% down. So just to not lose money it has to go up by 10%.

This is called "use value".
It's not intrinsic because, for example, 100,000 years ago, no industrial uses for gold and silver existed, but gold and silver did exist. Hence, they have no intrinsic value because this implies that whenever they exist they are valuable, and no one valued them back then.

We already have a decentralized exchange. It's called localbitcoins.com. Personally, I think some grand decentralized exchange is a pipe dream. Basically because this exchange needs to store dollars (if people want to exchange for dollars), and dollars can't be stored in a decentralized manner. If it doesn't store dollars, you will effectively be dealing in IOUs. I, personally, am not interested in buying USD IOUs on a decentralized exchange, and I suspect many others have the same attitude.

It does. I've tried it on Linux. You can create a "folder" in Linux whose content is stored in memory.
The only problem is that the block chain is currently around 8.5 GB, so you need at least 10 GB of RAM in your machine. And also the fact that when you restart your computer, it's gone. So remember to copy it from the RAM-folder to your HDD.
It really isn't necessary any longer though. You won't get below OP's 17 minutes even if you do it entirely in RAM.

Interesting article! Thanks for sharing. Although when these sorts of manipulation schemes are brought up, I can't help thinking "let them". To me, it's just speculators playing with speculators. Blaming the recent crash on speculators completely overlooks that the parabolic rise was *also* created by speculators. It seems to me that the people that complain over speculators causing a crash want to have their cake and eat it too; they want the surge in price as speculators drive up the price, but they don't want the crash when things correct to a more sane speed of increase.

Creating two pieces of data that hash to the same value is called a collision attack. MD5 is susceptible to this.
Figuring out what output goes into a hash function in order to create a certain hash (output) is called a pre-image attack. MD5 is still almost as strong as it has ever been, since it requires 2^123.4 attempts, on average, which is only about 24 times less than if it were completely uncompromised (which would require 2^128 attempts on average, for a 128 bit hash function).
MD5's susceptibility to the collision attack is unrelated to recovering the password from an MD5 hash hereof.

You're completely ignoring the purchasing power of money. The amount in itself is immaterial, it's what you can buy with it that matters.
So my holding of currency could decrease while I get richer at the same time, simply by prices falling. No one has to produce currency for you to get richer; it makes no difference. You're not richer because you hold more money, it's what you can buy with that money which makes you rich.

There is no speed advantage since you don't spend any time waiting for anything. As soon as a new block appears, you start mining a new block without any transactions in it. As new transactions come in you add them while hashing the whole time.

28 nm STM is 18,000 €/mm2 for their "multi-project wafer service" where you share wafer space with others:
Although I'm not completely sure what if that's €18k per mm² of unique chip surface area, or €18k per mm^2 of total chip surface area (ie. 1000 5mm² chips being €90m). The latter sounds quite expensive.

I think they doubled it, almost (from 20-ish to 40). I don't think they can go above 40 TPS right now. We've seen some pretty hefty action in the past 12 hours, and I think that would have exceeded 40 TPS if they didn't have that ceiling. You can see from the graph from April 16 and onwards how both the TPS spikes increase as well as the base TPS level. It would surprise me if at some point there weren't more than 40 orders waiting for executing in a single second during that time, it was pretty intense.
It's also worth noting that their trading engine isn't really capped by any TPS rate. Their engine manages an order book, and if a lot of people are adding or removing orders from the book, that will put a strain on their trading engine and lower the maximum number of TPS it can handle. A transaction only happens when a bid and an ask meet, but the trading engine works even when no transaction happens, simply because it's constantly adding and removing orders from the order book.

It matters because that person has consumed less than he has produced, or he wouldn't be able to purchase and hold those bitcoins in the first place.


That's exactly what it means. When he withholds his supply of bitcoins, the supply decreases and the price increases more than it would have had he sold/spent these coins.


The price is growing because people are, on average, spending fewer bitcoins than they buy. It's as simple as that. More goods (that includes money) is going into bitcoin than leaving it.

My calculations show that if difficulty rises 1% *per day* for the next 365 days, then at the end of those 365 days one will have mined 49.2 BTC.
One would start out mining 0.5 BTC per day, and end up - after 365 days (under the above assumption) - mining only 0.0132 BTC per day.
A 1% increase in hash rate per day would mean that the hash rate, at the end of those 365 days would be around 38 times what it is now (92.75 TH/s), which would mean that on 2014-04-29 the hash rate will be 3504 TH/s.
The current 14-day average for the growth in network hash rate is around 1.2% per day (it has varied between 0.8% and 1.8% in the last two months).

Thanks! I felt the same way when hearing Keith Weiner for the first time too. Refreshing.
His basic premise is that you can't really use the gold *price* to predict anything, as this is simply a product of how many dollars are printed.
He looks at the basis (and cobasis) to see whether there are shortages or abundance in the market. His hypothesis is that the canary in the coal mine for our monetary system is gold backwardation, ie. when gold futures contracts become cheaper than spot market gold. This is already happening in the near-month contracts, but when it becomes permanent (in all contracts, even those far out) it will signal the end of our current monetary system.
Very interesting indeed. He provides a perspective that I can't find anywhere else in the field.
He's a student of Antal Fekete, who has also got some really interesting insights on monetary theory.


I have the exact same feeling. I value his opinion but I don't agree with him on several points. But it provides a valuable counter weight to the theory of almost everyone else; it's like he views things from a different perspective.
P.S., thanks for the tip! :)

A new house obvously doesn't need repairs right from the beginning. It takes a while for things to deteriorate. The 4% p.a. is over the entire lifetime of the house. You can easily go 10 years without doing any repairs, but all of the sudden your roof needs fixing, or your windows, and that's damn expensive. So it's wise to save up every year, or you won't have the money when the day comes that repairs are needed.

You don't have to control half of the network hash rate to successfully perform a double spend, and I worry that you don't know better, as a representative of Bitpay.
Since Bitcoin is based on cryptography, it's all about probabilities. Even with 6 confirmations, you cannot be sure that someone can't pull off a double spend, you can only calculate the probability of someone pulling it off successfully, [which is less than 0.1% after 5 confirmations if you have 10% of the network hash rate](
But for Bitpay to work properly we're not talking about 3 or 5 confirmations, people aren't content with waiting 30-50 minutes for their payment to get confirmed. So what is relevant here are 0-confirmation transactions.
At the end of the day, if Bitpay is so confident that double spends aren't an issue, why don't you just make payments final without any confirmations, and take on the risk yourselves?
To me it seems a bit hypocritical to criticize ones clients for worrying about the risk of double spends when you are not willing to take on that risk yourselves. If you really believe your own statement - that the double spend attack is not relevant to your merchants - you should be willing to take on the risk yourselves, and cover losses in case of successful double spends.
There are some quite interesting solutions to the 0-confirmation problem, actually, what is missing is writing the code. Here's an explanation by gmaxwell (the link for the full discussion is [here](


combined with child-pays-for-parent creates a new kind of double spend
_defense_: If someone double spends a payment to an online key of
yours, you can instantly produce a child transaction that pays 100% of
the double spend to fees... so a double spender can hurt you but not
profit from it.  (and if your side of the transaction is
potentially/partially reversible he will lose)...
So, in other words, Bitpay could state that anyone who tries to double spend against a Bitpay address will have their payment confiscated. This could be an experimental setting at first, where users are thoroughly warned about what will happen if they either try to perform a double spend intentionally, or in case one is produced as a result of a software bug.
That's one possible solution to the problem, at least.

Upon further research, it seems I was wrong: the CFD broker acts as a market maker, and thus both sells and buys CFDs. I thought they worked as a broker/exchange, putting buyers and sellers in contact with each other.
But the fact that they act as a market maker probably means that they will hedge their position on Mt. Gox. If they don't, that would be way too much unmanaged risk. Thus, if you buy $10M worth of CFD contracts at a 4:1 leverage, they will have to buy $40M worth of bitcoins at Mt. Gox (less any short positions from other customers), to hedge their position.
And so, you drive up the price on Mt. Gox yourself by buying those CFDs. But maybe you can still take advantage of it by buying the CFD and immediately after buying on Mt. Gox. But I don't have the sufficient funds to try it out.

You make some good points. But allow me to rebut.


Hardware doesn't cost anything near that. Margins are *huge* right now. Probably more than 1,000%. Prices will drop as demand dries out at the higher prices levels. 
We've seen it with ASICMiner, and we'll see it with Avalon, BitFury etc. The reason mining hardware is so expensive right now is not production costs, it's because you can make a lot of money with it.
But all these companies having invested in the research and development of a Bitcoin mining chip will not stop selling mining hardware until their margins fall below a couple dozen percent.
So if we assume the 20% increase in network speed per difficulty adjustment, that means each difficulty adjustment will take 11.2 days. That's 32.5 difficulty adjustments in a year. At 2016 blocks per difficulty adjustment, that's 2016 * 32.5 * 25 BTC = 1,638,000 BTC = $163,800,000 in miner's revenue (at current prices).
In order for miners to make a profit in a year, let's say they buy hardware for 70% of this (although I think they will buy more, look at people buying unprofitable USB Block Erupters), $115M USD. The average price of a 400 GH miner would then need to be $430.
Given that a 400 GH Bitfury miner for October delivery is $8,000 right now, that's a 20x reduction is sale price. So the company producing these either need to earn 2,000% margins right now or another company needs to come in that can produce them cheaper.

No it wouldn't. Block headers are only 80 bytes, the size difference would be minuscule. The real problem is that we would have a lot of orphan chains, because someone would find a block, and another person would find "the same" block before he learned about this other block. So in effect, it would mean that, sometimes, people would see their transaction be verified, with for example 3 confirmations, and then dropping to zero confirmations, because the block chain that included the transaction became orphaned.
You don't win anything by making confirmations quicker, you only make each confirmation less trustworthy.

The real question to ask is: "how long does it take to reach a number of confirmations that give the same probability of performing a subsequent double spend attack for Bitcoin and Terracoin?".
The 6 confirmations of Bitcoin Qt client is completely arbitrary. It is not inherent to the protocol.
Even if Bitcoin blocks were generated once per minute (instead of one every 10 minutes), you'd still need to wait, on average, 60 minutes to get the same level of confidence that a double spend attack can't occur, as you would with 1 confirmation per 10 minutes.

Neither Keith Weiner nor I claim manipulation isn't taking place, *you* and GATA are claiming it *is* taking place. When the evidence is reviewed, as by Keith Weiner in the video I linked to, there is no evidence it is going on. Please, substantiate your claim and show some actual proof.
I've read GATA material. It mostly consists of interpretations of vague quotes from central bankers.
Now take a look at this. GATA's Chris Powell was on Capital Account some time ago. I took the time to watch the whole interview. Now we get to the part where Lauren asks him what is *the* smoking gun piece of evidence that proves that manipulation is going on:
His answer? The Fed refusing to release documents pertaining to their gold swap arrangements with foreign central banks.
That's it! That's the very best piece of evidence GATA has: the Fed *not* releasing a set of documents!
Now, again, I'm *not* saying they're not doing it, I'm simply saying that the evidence that they *are* doing it is very weak, at best, especially when you look at the gold basis (price difference between futures market and spot market)
Tell me, how can an actor in the market drive down the price of gold by way of naked short selling of gold futures without driving down the price of gold futures, and thus the basis? Do you have an explanation for that? Does GATA?

I can. The purpose of money is to exchange a good or service with someone who doesn't have anything you're interested in. The money can then later be exchanged by the recipient for something that she finds useful.
This is why a single money is more useful than multiple monies: if the person you're buying something from only accepts Litecoin, you have to exchange your Bitcoin for Litecoin first, thus increasing the effort required to perform an exchange. Both parties will prefer if the exchange can be done in a single operation, so the most liquid money will be preferred.


And that' where we disagree. Litecoin's market cap is currently 5% of that if Bitcoin. I think that in 5 years the situation will be that Litecoin's market cap will be even less compared to Bitcoin.
In any case, the market cap isn't the most important metric; the liquidity is. In other words, how much would one drop the price of Bitcoin vs Litecoin if one were to buy/sell, say, $1M worth of the currency. I don't have any figured for this for Litecoin, but I suspect that Bitcoin is around 1000 times more liquid than Litecoin.
If we compare the two largest exchanges for Bitcoin and Litecoin, Mt. Gox and BTC-e, respectively, we can see that on Mt. Gox, [a total of $37.7bn bid on bitcoin at any price]( On BTC-e, [a total of $284M]( bid on litecoin at any price. That's a difference of a factor of around 130. I think this factor will increase over time, not decrease.
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:04:35
That's not how Bitcoin transactions work.
Each time you send bitcoins you assign your previously owned bitcoins to a new address in a transaction. You can think of it as looking like this:
    tx_id: &lt;unique_transaction_id&gt;
    input: &lt;your_address&gt;
    output: &lt;other_guy's_address&gt;
    output: &lt;your_change_addres&gt;
In the block chain there are 175 of these transactions, each assigning a tiny amount of BTC to &lt;other_guy's_address&gt;, in this case OP's address.
To redeem all these transactions, and send the final amount to a new address, OP has to construct a transaction that uses the output from all these 175 transactions as inputs in a new transaction:
    input: from tx_id1 redeem &lt;other_guy's_address&gt;
    input: from tx_id2 redeem &lt;other_guy's_address&gt;
    input: from tx_id3 redeem &lt;other_guy's_address&gt;
    input: from tx_id4 redeem &lt;other_guy's_address&gt;
    input: from tx_id5 redeem &lt;other_guy's_address&gt;
    [...]
    output: &lt;destination_address&gt;
This produces a huge transaction, which means that an appropriately huge fee (in % terms for OP) is required by most miners.

That's correct - that's the amount of open connections maintained (you can specify that max number of connections in `bitcoin.conf`). But regardless of how many nodes it's connected to, it only does the initial sync from a single node. Only if that node disappears does it switch to another node. So initial sync can be quite slow if you're unlucky and a slow node is picked for the initial sync. But as I said, it's being worked on:

When a decentralized Silk Road has been built and proven to work, then surely, a centralized site is pointless. But until that happens it makes sense to go with something we know works.


The honeypot-point is moot, as far as I can see. Even if a decentralized goods-and-services exchange were to be set up, law enforcement could just create seller accounts on this service, acting as honeypots. If buyers on a centralized service use PGP to encrypt their address, this would be no different from that, as a compromised centralized service would then not have access to the address of buyers.

It's pointless to try to prevent ASICs. A CPU will *always* be the slowest way to execute an algorithm. Sure, the fact that SecureCoin and Quarkcoin use several different hashing algorithms makes it more complicated to develop an ASIC, but if either of them ever take off, that will quickly become irrelevant (because of potential profit)
In fact, I'd argue that the easier it is to develop an ASIC the better. This means that we will have a greater number of companies developing ASICs (as we have with Bitcoin). Instead of a single company at a time diving into the task of implementing 8 different hashing algorithms in silicon - which definitely is possible, just tiresome.

It requires intelligence, we agree on that, but I don't think it requires any intimate knowledge of cryptography. You could easily invent Bitcoin without knowing the math behind ECC. You just need a `sign()` and `verify()` function provided by some cryptography library, in Bitcoin's case [cryptopp]( was used.
Other than that it requires knowledge of the different types of asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC) and their key size to security ratio. This is required to know that ECC, with it's high amount of security per key bit, is most suitable because it requires less than a tenth of the storage space compared to an equally secure RSA key.

@_date: 2013-02-11 22:33:20


I don't buy this premise. ASIC producers are currently selling to consumers, they're precisely *not* developing ASICs and mining themselves. How are barriers to entry "high" when all you have to do is place an order and get a mining device? This seems like an extremely low barrier to me, compared to a lot of other industries.
I mean, if you need to set up a VPS host, you need a computer that costs more than these ASIC devices, and yet, we have a *huge* number of VPS providers. Sure, there are large entities among these (Amazon, Google) but there are still a huge number of tiny, small, and medium sized companies offering the exact same service.
Why wouldn't Bitcoin mining become just like this (with large players but also many medium, small and tiny players)?

I think there's a lot of potential in using TPM-enabled computers (built into the CPU). These computers basically have a CPU instruction where you can ask the CPU to create a private key that can only be read by a piece of code who hashes to a certain hash.
So you essentially write some code that reads a private key and signs a transaction with it, and tell the CPU that the key you're creating now can *only* be read by the code that hashes to the hash of the that code, and then only that piece of code can have access to the private key (unless the actual hardware is vulnerable).
That's pretty damn clever!
Here's an example implementation of it (requires a CPU with TPM support):

If we, as humans, produce more goods - if the supply of goods increases - then why shouldn't we get richer from doing nothing?
If a man knocks on my door, offering an item for $50, which I decline, and later, another guy knocks on my door offering an item for $40, I "have gotten richer by doing nothing". What is wrong with this?
Logically, you can't oppose "getting richer by doing nothing". It's not possible. Because if you want holders of currency to *not* get richer by doing nothing, you *have to*, necessarily, promote the issuers of the currency getting richer by doing nothing. When humans produce more than we consume, we get richer. That wealth cannot disappear, nor do we want it to. So the only choice we're left with is whether we want the *issuers of currency* to get richer by doing nothing, or the *holders of currency* to get richer. Which is more fair to you?

Lowering your prices usually isn't a great response to running out of cash. It could also suggest that they want to stay competitive, because they know new Bitcoin processors will enter who can undercut 0.99% (not 1.99%), and they want to capture more customers before this happens.
Tony Gallipi stated 10 months ago that their plan has always been to lower fees, not increase them: 
Bitcoin payment processing isn't really an area where you can survive while charging 1% in fees. They basically have the entire payment infrastructure already in order, costing nothing, 1% is ridiculously high in that light, and raising it sure doesn't make any sense unless you want competitors to snatch up your market share.

When you run a bitcoin node you verify transactions and pass them on to other nodes, if they live up to the standard. So while it doesn't secure these transactions (through mining), it does aid in the process, by spreading around valid transactions.
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:15:22
This is true. But note what happens when the lenders use their 1 BTC to pay someone else. Let's say they all pay 1 BTC each to the same person - we'll call him Louie - who now has 9 BTC. Louie deposits these 9 BTC into his bank account, and he has 9 BTC on deposit.
So now we're in a situation where the original depositor has 10 BTC in his bank account, *and* Louie has 9 BTC in his bank account. There are now 19 BTC, where there were only 10 BTC before.
The above isn't a problem as long as the duration of the loans match each other. If you deposit 10 BTC into a demand-deposit account (an account you can withdraw from at any time), and they are lent out as a 1-year loan, this is risky. This is called "duration mismatch". If, however, you deposit 10 BTC into an account where they are locked for one year, and 90% of them are lent out to borrowers as a 1-year loan, there is no risk of a bank run. Of course, the borrowers might be unable to pay, but there is no risk of the depositor withdrawing his funds prematurely.
Here's a longer article on why fractional reserve banking isn't necessarily a problem, but why duration mismatch is always a problem (sooner or later):

What about an animation of several QR codes in a row, to accommodate for a larger transaction size? This would, of course, require a custom QR reader app, but it should be fairly simple to implement, I reckon.
Just append a sequence number and the total number of QR codes to the beginning of every QR code. Then let the displaying app cycle through each QR code with a, say, 2 second delay.
The receiver app simply scans the QR codes, and displays a progress bar that increases for every QR code that is successful scanned, and says "Done!" when all QR codes have been scanned. It doesn't have to catch each one, since they are cycled through repeatedly. And the receiving app knows when it has all of them since it knows the sequence number of each QR code, and how many there are in total.

This doesn't make sense. Bitcoin is money and Twitter is a company with an income.
If the market depth is sufficient, Bitcoin can serve its purpose even with a market cap of only $6bn.
With a $6bn market cap (and plenty of market depth) Bitcoin can theoretically transfer $6bn every hour, if we're going for 6 confirmations. That's a theoretical limit of $144bn per day.
So at the current transaction volumes (far less than ~$100bn being transferred via Bitcoin per day), a market cap of $6bn is quite suitable.
Now, the future is something else, of course. But you seem to be talking about the present moment.

The really important metric is latency. The ioDrive2 has a read latency of  68 microseconds. So it's not even twice as fast as the average 100 microseconds for consumer SSDs.
Also, if you can verify the block chain in 17 minutes, the bottleneck is almost certainly not the disk any longer, it's verifying transactions using the CPU (ECDSA signature verification).

I disagree. Gold and silver are two very distinct assets. They're used for very different things in the industry. If an enormously huge gold mine was suddenly found, the gold price would plummet, the silver price wouldn't (it would probably rise significantly, as people move into silver).
The differences between Litecoin and Bitcoin are so insignificant that the risk of Bitcoin going down and Litecoin surviving is tiny, if it's even existent.
Litecoin still depends on SHA256, as I mention above, since it's used for transaction IDs. So Litecoin isn't any more protected against SHA256 being broken that Bitcoin is.

Good question. The difference is that without 2FA, people can get your encrypted wallet from blockchain.info, and work on cracking it locally. With 2FA, they can't get your encrypted wallet, so they can't try cracking it.

Reason number 7: bitcoins, like any good form of money, is a homogeneous mass, one unit indistinguishable from the next. But wait, I know what you're going to say.
"*But we can trace the path of an amount of stolen bitcoins, and see where they end up!*"
The anwer is: sort of, but not quite.
Let's say someone steals 10 BTC, and everyone knows at which address they reside. Now that person sends the 10 BTC to his other address, which also contains 10 BTC, *effectively merging the stolen and clean BTC with each other*.
So now you have 20 BTC that are "half stolen".
Should we accept these bitcoins? Are half-stolen bitcoins ok? 
What about when he sends those 20 BTC to his third address with 180 BTC in it, merging the 20 BTC and 180 BTC, creating 200 BTC that are "5% stolen".
Should we accept bitcoins that are "5% stolen"?
And so on, and so forth.

I'm well aware of that. And I keep pointing out that it changes nothing. Using the Martingale system, the only thing you gain from a loss being extremely unlikely is that your potential winnings are extremely small.
If we use your 35 consecutive bets as an example, in order to win 0.001 BTC you would have to bet 34,359,738.367 BTC. So you'd have to have more bitcoins in existance in order to potentially win the equivalent of less than $1.
That's completely pointless.
If Warren Buffet converted half of all of the assets he owns to dollars, he'd have around $30 billion. If he was willing to risk half of his fortune, he'd be able to win $1. Again, what is the point?
Are you seriously suggesting that a betting strategy that requires one to obtain 30 billion dollars in order to potentially win 1 dollar is worthwhile in any way?

Mt. Gox' lag is measured in minutes. The lag of the NYSE and LSE are measured in *microseconds*. If we can just get down to milliseconds that would mean the problem is basically non-existant as far as regular users are concerned.
Also, HFT bots do not "reap millions of dollars to the detriment of everyone else". They reap millions of dollars *from each other*. You and I couldn't care less if there's a microsecond lag on the exchange, if you're just doing casual selling and buying. You just put in your limit order at whichever price you want to buy at, and your order executes at that price.
HFT is speculators playing with speculators. That's all.

This doesn't raise the *bid price* (what you can get for a bitcoin if you sell it now), it increases the volume of the *ask price* at higher levels. Miners demanding more money for their bitcoins does not disable other people from selling them at lower prices. You've got cause and effect reversed.

The one thing I had in mind wrt. to security, is something that was suggested on the forums a while back. You basically create an offline box that stores the private keys needed to move the bitcoins that are deposited. This box also stores the public portion of a public/private key pair that is generated from the user's password in Javascript for each user on the site. In order for the box to create an actual transaction, the online server (to which the box is connected) will need to have the user sign a nonce (provided by the box) with his private key, and the box can then verify this with the stored public key, and subsequently create a transaction. This prevents a hacker from gaining anything immediately, but if he's able to install a rootkit that replaces newly registered users' public keys with his own, he can steal the coins that are deposited since he compromised the system. But that would at least make it somewhat harder for an attacker.
What is your idea with using colored coins exactly?

PayPal does not accept chargebacks on items not purchased on eBay (I asked them myself: [(1)]( Additionally, the CC chargeback might not work, since it's possible they will say that you've got what you paid for: a PayPal money transfer to the payee.
A ruling on the latter has been made where I live, in Denmark, that says that if you buy something with a credit card via PayPal, what you really pay for (from the point of view of the bank) is a PayPal payment to whomever you're paying. And regardless of whether you get screwed, you've gotten what you've paid for (a money transfer to the seller), and you're not eligible for a chargeback on the CC.
I'm not sure if similar precedence is present in US law, though.

Imagine that you have to find a secret code every 10 minutes. No one knows how to find the code except by starting somewhere a continuing until you find the number (this is called "brute force"). However, when someone finds the next secret code, it's easy for everyone else to verify that this indeed is the next correct secret code.
When they find the secret code they add this secret code to the end of the list of all the previous secret codes found, and the process starts over. You end up with a long list of all the secret codes found, where a new one is added every 10 minutes. Importantly, *the next secret code that has to be found depends on the previous secret code that is added to the piece of paper containing all the previous codes*.
Now imagine 10,000 people standing on a large market place all trying to find the secret code. When someone finds the newest secret code, the paper that contains the previous codes needs to travel to that person so he can write the newly found code to the end of the list of codes.
You can decide how difficult it should be to find the next secret code by adjusting the difficulty. How long would you say it should take to find a secret code? If you set it to 1 minute, there's a good chance that someone will find a new secret code, and while the paper with the secret codes travel to this person, another one finds a code as well, but this code won't be valid because a valid code has already been found, and the new secret code to be found now depends on the secret code that hasn't been added to the piece of paper yet, because it's still on its way to the person who found it.
If codes are found too fast, people will be wasting a lot of their time trying to find a code when one has already been found. Additionally, and probably more important, is that the people closest to the piece of paper containing the previous codes will have an advantage over the people further away of finding the new secret code because they know first what the newest code is that they need to find the next code. The result would be that people would all try to get to the place where the secret code list is, instead of focusing on finding the next code, because it would give them an advantage in finding the next code. People would get stomped to death on the market place as people rush to the place where the piece of paper is, and it would result in fewer people working on just finding the next code instead of travelling over to the piece of paper.
Bitcoin uses 10 minutes because this was deemed by the designer to be a suitable amount of time for the piece of paper containing the previous codes to travel to the person who has found a code, and for everyone else to learn what the newest code is, so they can base their work on this code.

Very true. The problem is that the government, essentially (through central banks), control the interest rate. It's really no wonder that a debtor will keep adding to his debt if he can control the interest on it. This is only possible because central banks want to appease governments, because the government is the entity that hands out special favors to the central banks, which are the producer of a country's national currency. With Bitcoin (or gold), governments and central banks are not able to control interest rates, and must respond to the market sentiment.

As far as I can tell, this is no different from, for example, the US. Bitcoin isn't regulated in the US either.
Running an exchange, however, *does* require a permit, because you would be handling "electronic money" (you send traditional currency to the exchange, who then credit your exchange account with an electronic representation of that money).
I recall getting denied by the Danish FSA to run a Bitcoin exchange, because they were required to have someone with experience in the financial industry in order to handle electronic money ("electronic money" referring to a digital representation of *traditional currency* (EUR/DKK), not bitcoin). That's why their current solution ( is not an exchange (a broker that pairs buyers and sellers), but simply a place to buy bitcoins with traditional currency. No "electronic money" are handled.

So you know DPR? I've read interview with the guy, and I have no ability to gauge his level of intelligence. He's obviously very dedicated about libertarianism, but that doesn't necessarily translate into meticulously covering all your tracks from the get-go.
I think it's possible that he simply didn't think start out super paranoid. Why would he? No one knew Silk Road, it was an experiment. He obviously grew paranoid - which was warranted - but we can't juxtapose his previous lack of discretion, when Silk Road was completely unknown, to the all-encompassing $1M/month, wanted-by-every-three-letter-agency operation that it is now, and say it doesn't fit. That was then, this is now.

I would strongly advise you to use Armory. Armory does exactly what you line out, but completely automatically. If you don't follow this advice, please make sure to read up on "change", and how it works with Bitcoin, as well as how transactions work (inputs and outputs).
With Armory, you have Offline Armory running on your offline/cold device, and Online Armory on your hot PC. When you want to make a transaction from your cold wallet, you fire up Online Armory on the hot PC, let it sync (takes ~5 mins with the newest version), create the transaction and write it to a USB stick. You then transfer the unsigned transaction to your cold PC, on which you fire up Offline Armory. You use this to sign the transaction in question, write the signed transaction to the USB stick, and publish it on the hot PC using Online Armory.
The private keys never leave your offline PC, and you can back up your wallet using a piece of paper, that will restore your wallet completely.

I think he has a valid point. Proof-of-work is problematic on mobile devices. The more proof-of-work you need, the more you drain your battery. The less you need, the higher the chance of spam becoming profitable.
I think the solution is using bitcoins instead. With bitcoin you basically outsource the proof-of-work to the miners, and deter spamming by adding a cost that is greater than what spammers can earn by spamming.

No, it really didn't. The basis (difference between price in the spot and futures market) would show this. [It didn't.](
It simply looked like scared, highly leveraged investors dumping physical metal onto the spot market.
When you sell "paper gold" (futures contracts) you reduce the bid price for gold futures contracts. This means that we can look at the bid for the futures contract to see what's going on. During the huge dump, this didn't drop, the bid in the spot market dropped.

Hiding fees from the customers don't make them go away. It's important to remember that a 1% fee (Bitpay) vs 3% fee (VISA) is huge if you're a reseller. Imagine buying a lot of, for example, GPUs for $400 per piece, and selling them again at a 10% markup for $440 per piece. If someone buys the GPU with a VISA card, 3% of that sale will go to VISA, and you'll only really sell it for $426.8. So you've reduced your profit from 10% to 6.7%. That's quite a dramatic difference. If you only pay a 1% fee, however, you'll be selling a $440 product for $435.6, increasing your profit to 8.9% vs the 6.7%. You've increased you profit by over 30%! 
The CEO of Bitpay mentioned in a talk that Amazon pays as much in credit card fees as it earns in profits from re-selling stuff. As an online retailer, there is so much competition that the difference in fees from 3% to 1% really isn't as small as it may seem like to us.

The 0.1% figure is if an entity controls 10% of the hash rate and you wait for 5 confirmations. If you wait for 5 confirmations Bitpay is not comparable to credit cards, as a payment would take, on average, 45 minutes to confirm.
We need to know the risk at zero confirmations, which isn't really known, and probably cannot be defined in any precise terms. But still, I'd venture the guess that it's less than what companies lose on fraudulent credit card chargebacks.
But I still maintain my position that double spends is not a non-issue, and Bitpay should not treat is as such. And if they do, they should put their money where their mouth is.

The flaw is that a constant amount of coins produced per year is just as arbitrary as an exponential decline in coins produced per year. The former resembles gold, which also experiences price deflation.
So the difference will just be that one coin exhibits more price deflation than the other. No qualitative difference. Why would the one be better than the other?
If people can cope with a 2% increase in purchasing power per year, so can they calculate with a 10% increase in purchasing power per year.

Or if the Bitfury resellers can keep their August deadline. I think this is the greatest threat to ASICMINER. They offer a vastly superior product. 0.8J/GH vs 8J/GH for ASICMINER's chips. At around 1/4th the price per GH (compared to the new Blade price announcement from Rockxie). But they're not shipping yet, so it's not really comparable. But *if* they ship, they are going to put a huge dent in ASICMINER's hardware sales, I think.


I agree that short term (1-2 months) it might be the way to go. But it's too risky for me. I sold at 4.3 about 5 hours before the dividend payout. And now I can buy them back for 4.15. So with 0.025 in dividends, that's a 3% (0.125 BTC) profit from arbitraging that market, if I were to buy them back again.

I'm honestly not sure Bitcoin mining is even a good investment right now. People seem to be willing to pay way too much for mining devices. I wouldn't be surprised if the 50 BTC Blades never pay themselves off. Buying Bitcoins straight up might prove to be a lot more profitable investment. I'd at least consider investing a portion of the money in bitcoins.
But if you really want to get into it, I would say the most important advice is the following: **don't put all your eggs in one basket.** I'd predominately buy anything available for shipping right now, which really only includes Blades (when they become available again). But I would also make an order with some of the money (say 20%-ish) for alternatives that offer cheaper devices (like TerraHash) and perhaps ASICMiner shares as well (good advice !). Here's an overview of the various ASIC devices promised: 
If I could go back in time I would have ordered one of all the ASIC devices for sale a year ago. Even if only one of them shipped (which the Avalon did) I would still have made a lot of money.
@_date: 2013-01-26 17:33:09
My guess: no, it will not. If only BFL were the first to ship, you'd have a better chance. But Avalon devices are shipping now (at least two of them), and I reckon there's a good chance they will be shipped before BFL starts shipping.

Here are my calculations:
Litecoin current total hashrate: 62,954.3 MH/s
Mining Litecoins with a HD 5870 gives 420 kH/s
Bitcoin difficulty at 2013-01 (two years after inception): 16,307.4
This translates into a hashrate of 117 GH/s (2^(32)×16307.4÷600)
Mining Bitcoins with a HD 5870 (back in the beginning of 2011) - 420 MH/s
Litecoin: equivalent of 149,890 HD 5870's
Bitcoin @ Jan 2013: equivalent of 278 HD 5870's
So it looks like Litecoin is around 500 times more expensive to attack than Bitcoin was two years after its inception.

So after running some numbers on Mt. Gox' maximum TPS throughput [here]( I wanted to see more clearly how the TPS rate developed during the crash and afterwards.
So I expanded [my script]( to pull data directly from Mt. Gox' API - in this case all transactions from 2013-04-09 04:00 UTC and until now - and calculate the 1-second average transaction rate from this data.
Bear in mind that a lot of time has passed since 2013-04-09 04:00, so doing a 1-second average (which is the only way to see the true peaks) will make it seem like Mt. Gox is under more heavy load than they really are, because a 1-pixel wide bar of a high TPS will cover up many other seconds where the TPS rate was not so high.
We're covering roughly 604,800 seconds here, on a 2300 pixel wide graph, so every pixel covers up over four minutes.
So this graph really shows *peak* levels, not sustained levels.
I can also do a 5-second, 10-second, 60-second average, etc. but it wouldn't be as interesting as - I think - it's when Mt. Gox really hits their ceiling on how many transactions they can process that the lag is introduced.
If anyone has historic lag data, please let me know, and I'll try to overlay that on the graph, to see how well it corresponds to the TPS figure.
**EDIT:** Here's a chart focusing on the big sell-off on Apr 10-11: 
We definitely see an increase in base TPS rate, and more spikes.
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:04:07
There isn't really a spread between Mt. Gox and other exchanges, because you can't buy USD on Mt. Gox, since they don't do transfers of USD. What you can currently buy for your bitcoins on Mt. Gox is "mtgoxUSD", which is a form of credit that may or may not be paid back. The most accurate description of it would be that mtgoxUSD is a USD futures contract, denominated in BTC, that expires when (if) Mt. Gox enables USD withdrawals again.
Thus, what we are seeing is not a spread between BTCUSD on different exchanges, but the difference in price of actual, electronic USD, and mtgoxUSD (a BTC-denominated USD futures contract). So we are seeing that sellers of bitcoins on Mt. Gox are currently demanding an 8% premium on accepting mtgoxUSD instead of actual USD.
@_date: 2013-08-12 16:45:47


I don't think Mt. Gox is insolvent. How would Mt. Gox become insolvent exactly? They've had between 50% and 90% market share for two years if not more, charging probably an average fee of 0.3%, if not more.
Just look at the volumes: 
Even if we assume only 0.1% of the 30-day volume, that's $57,841.24 + 585.58 BTC = $113471.38 of income every single month. I have a hard time imagining how a company basically just running servers and employing support staff going insolvent with this income.
But still, I must admit I'm at bit weary storing money on Mt. Gox, and I wouldn't recommend anyone do it. We've seen what can happen in the past.

This is Austrian economics.
Prices are how human beings communicate value in a capitalistic economy. It's one of the best measures of value there are, simply because prices are influenced by all people participating in the market.
So in that sense, "consuming less than one produces" means the price of that which one consumes is less than what which one produces. I think this is a valid point of view because if people are willing to pay more for what you produce than they are willing to pay for what you consume (which is the case if the price of the former is higher than the price of the latter), wouldn't you say that what you produce is more valuable than what you consume (to people)?


of Bitcoin would be much higher.
Of course it would. The price per bitcoin would definitely be higher if there were only 1 million in circulation.


Yes, definitely. Supply is not the only factor. But all else being equal, an increase in the supply will decrease the price, and decrease will increase the price (per unit).

The problem, as I see it, is that we don't know the average fee paid per trade on Mt. Gox. IIRC it goes down to 0.2% for large volumes, and Mt. Gox could have special deals with even lower fees for dedicated market makers who promise a certain high volume.
Not to say that I think Karpeles isn't telling the truth, it's just not true that we can verify that what he's saying is true.
But yeah, it seems to boil down to a liquidity issue; they appear to be solvent but illiquid.

I agree. Buying $1M USD worth of bitcoins without huge slippage was out of the question only a year ago. If the buyer was smart (and maybe he was) he could have split the trade between Bitstamp and Mt. Gox (and other liquid exchanges) and gotten an even lower slippage.

Bitcoin is not money, and is not part of anything regulated by the United States. Shavers also 
contends that his transactions were all Bitcoin transactions and that no money ever exchanged hands.
Should this even matter? I mean, it matters in this case, because he's being charged with selling securities without a license. But, surely, it's not legal in the US to defraud your customers of *anything*, is it? Fraud is fraud, whether it deals with USD, bananas, or bitcoins, right?

Here's the important point that everyone seems to be missing:
When we produce more goods than we consume, we get richer as a whole. Full stop. There is no way around that. The only way to counter that (imagine the insanity of just *wanting* to counter that) is to destroy goods.
The only question is **who becomes richer as a consequence of this**? We obviously don't want to destroy wealth, and become poorer, but this is the only way that no one will ever benefit from producing more goods than we consume.
In our current regime of inflationary currencies, the holders of currency are not the ones who benefit from this increasing abundance of goods. It is instead the currency *producers* - and the individuals close to these - that benefit from our overall increase in wealth.
Is this more fair? Why should producers of money be more entitled to this increase in wealth than the holders of money?
The wealth is produced in the form of goods. The only way to remove the benefit of this from currency holders is to produce extra currency, and transfer the wealth from the holders of currency to the producers. Wealth does not go away solely by creating inflation, it is merely transferred elsewhere.

Let's examine this claim, shall we?
I run the site  which keeps track of some ASICMiner statistics. I do this using a script that makes it easy to pick out ASICMiner blocks and see how they differ from all other blocks.
    -----Stats-----:
    ASICMiner block stats:
	    Average transaction count per block: 198.0
	    Median transaction count: 132
	    Maximum number of transactions in a block: 1323
    Other blocks stats:
	    Average transaction count per block: 302.0
	    Median transaction count: 262
	    Maximum number of transactions in a block: 1333
So, yes, it looks like you're right. ASICMiner blocks contain, on average, only 65% of the number of transactions that all other blocks contain.

Hash rate is currently rising about [1% per day]( (14-day average). If this continues, then after a year this device will have mined 1.5 BTC, ie. not enough to pay itself back. In fact, it will never mine more than 1.5 BTC if the hash rate keeps increasing at this rate (1% per day).

Here's a metaphor to explain why this isn't better than Bitcoin.
Imagine you have a really good safe, which takes 10 minutes to securely lock, because you have to put 600 locks on the safe, and putting on each lock takes a second. After these 600 seconds (10 minutes) have passed, your safe is secured by 600 locks - it's really hard to get in.
Now, people start complaining that it takes too much time to secure whatever you put in there. People don't want to have to wait 10 minutes to lock their safe.
Then a competitor comes in, and clones the safe design completely. Then they say:
"*Our safe is much faster to lock! You only need to put on 10 locks, so it only takes 10 seconds!*"
They've done nothing to increase "added safety per second". They've just reduced the number of locks they define as a "locked safe".
This is exactly the same as with "faster coins". They're not safer, they simply reduce the requirement to be called "safe" (ie. the proof-of-work required to be done on a transaction in order for it to be called "confirmed").

They've been mining since July 2011. If they're been smart they've kept a large part of what they've mined and should be able to retire just about now.
So if it's been at it since July 2011, and has a network share of 5%, let's make a conservative estimate and say they've been mining a full year and 5% of network capacity. Block reward has been 50 BTC most of the time, so let's make it conservative again by saying the average is 37.5 BTC/block. That's around 100,000 BTC, or $7 million at today's rate. I would suspect this is one of the most profitable botnets out there - if it kept the bitcoins that is.
Which brings me to another point. It would be unsafe to let the malware client generate keys on the infected computer, since it would mean the private key would need to be transferred back to the malware author for him to cash out. So an interesting question is: does it mine to a single address? To a set of addresses? If this is the case we should be able to see exactly how much it has mined.

You don't need to parse the scriptSig to get the info you've shown. You will, however, need to build bitcoind from source to get support for fetching full block data via RPC.
In my parser I use this combined with `bitcointools` like so:
    from bitcointools import BCDataStream, deserialize    
    hexblock = btcrpc.getblock(block_hash, False)
    bstream = BCDataStream.BCDataStream()
    bstream.write(hexblock.decode('hex'))
    block_info = deserialize.parse_Block(bstream)
    for tx_info in block_info['transactions']:
        txid = dsha256(tx_info['__data__'])[::-1].encode('hex')
        for out in tx_info['txOut']:
            address = deserialize.extract_public_key(out['scriptPubKey'])
		    print "Output in transaction %s to address %s" % \
			    (txid, address)
        for vin in tx_info['txIn']:
            if vin['prevout_hash'] == "\x00"*32:
                 transaction
                break
            else:
                address = deserialize.extract_public_key(vin['scriptSig'])
		        print "Input in transaction %s from address %s" % \
			        (txid, address)
Parsing the scriptSig isn't necessary because all outputs referenced in a scriptSig is an output in a scriptPubKey (it has to be that way). So just by parsing the scriptPubKey you get all addresses in the chain.

Would it make sense to explicitly mark transactions as "replacable" and "non-replacable"? For example by setting the "sequence" field to 0, and the lock time to 0 as well?
This would mean we can have the ability of re-sending the same transaction with a higher fee, if the fee of the first transaction proved too small.
One problem is preventing double spends. If we can freely send out the same transaction with a higher fee, it makes double spending easier. But if we explicitly mark the first transaction as "replacable", we can signal that this transaction isn't necessarily final, and that we might replace it with one with a higher fee if we suspect it won't be confirmed fast enough.
At the same time, any merchant that accepts 0-confirmation transactions (for low-priced items, of course), wouldn't accept these types of transactions because they can be legitimately double spent.

Jeff Garzik isn't rich. He's made a lot of money because he was sent the first ASIC miner by the Avalon guys. Nor do you have to be rich to develop your own ASIC miner, like the Avalon guys, if you can get people to pre-order.
You need to be either lucky or productive though. Lucky in the sense that you need one of the first ASIC miners out (which was hard to predict), or productive by either writing code for Bitcoin and getting an ASIC for that in return (like jgarzik), or productive by actually producing an ASIC yourself.
I think that's a good incentive-structure. Requiring productivity to be certain that you'll make money. Indeed, that's the whole point of money in the first place; that it should be difficult to acquire it without helping your fellow man.

If you're on Linux, you can use the following command to generate a strong passphrase:


This picks 6 random words from the dictionary file /usr/share/dict/words (replace it with something else if you want; it's huge!) using the strong random number generator from /dev/random. Replace the number "6" in the command with a larger number if you want a stronger passphrase.
Using the following command removes words containing strange characters from the above dictionary, and picks seven words from it, resulting in a passphrase with 117 bits of entropy

I definitely think there is some truth to this, but we also have to consider that Mt. Gox announced they were going to deploy an upgrade to their trading engine during the downtime (I think there was an additional 1 hour downtime April 13 early in the morning).
So this should also have an effect on what their maximum capacity is. It seems they simply weren't able to handle more than 20-ish transactions per second before the upgrade. That was their ceiling. Similarly, if 40 TPS wasn't their ceiling now I'm sure we would see *much* higher peak TPS rates.
I might see if I can figure out a way to get volume in their without it covering up the TPS lines. Not right now though, I've been coding for the past 10 hours.

In time I don't think it matters whether Bitcoiners dislike anything less than a 2 year ROI time frame. There are plenty of businesses out there that are happy with a 5 year ROI. And the barrier to entry is so small that there's no keeping them out (thankfully).
But even if we cut that figure down by a factor of 100 (and still assume a factor 10 increase in efficiency), it's still 124 PH/s and a difficulty of 17 billion. Or about a factor 1000 change from now in hashing speed.

Also note that this calculation, which results in a 0.16 BTC profit by March 2014, assumes the difficulty will be 1.95 billion by then, which means the network hashrate would be 15,600 TH/s. This probably is possible, but it's also possible that the hashrate increase levels out somewhat as ASIC manufacturers can't get their devices sold because of these projections.
That much hashing power in BitFury chips (which is the most advanced chip on the market today) is over 6 million chips. That's not necessarily something you can spit out in 6 months. Even if we use KnC chips (which do 100 GH per chip) that's 150,000 chips. That's a lot of chips to spit out when they're that big. And (at current prices) KnC Jupiters to cover this hashrate would cost $187 million.

No, it's not. At 1 Ghash/s you can, currently, produce 0.39 BTC per week. This is currently worth $53.
Now tell me, if you were a producer of a device that could spit out $100 every two weeks per gigahash, would you be selling it for $100 per gigahash?
No, you wouldn't. Primarily because people are willing to pay *much* more than that, so why would you sell it for less?
At the recent [ASICMINER auction]( 10 Ghash/s devices were sold at around 75 BTC per device. That's around $975 per gigahash.
Why would anyone sell a device for $100 per gigahash when he or she can he $975 per gigahash?

No. It's fundamentally different. It's different because everyone gets "more" bitcoins in exact proportion to how much they hold. It would be the equivalent of removing a zero from all dollar bills (or adding one).
The reason that central bank-produced money injections are harmful to the economy, is precisely because it's *not* given to currency holders, but to banks and companies close to banks. This gives these businesses first access to the new money, and it also distorts relative prices, because prices will tend to rise in the area where the money is spent (stock market, bond market, housing market).


One bitcoin can currently be divided into 100 million discrete units, giving 2.1×10¹⁵ currency units (2100 trillion).

It's probably a software bottleneck. Writing an efficient trading engine isn't trivial. It's not rocket science either though. But many of these exchanges probably didn't want to invest too much in it at the early stages, before they knew whether they were going to be widely used, and before they had made some money on fees.

Another example:
Cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) is what is known as "cocaine". The salt form's increased water solubility enables adsorption through the mucous membranes in the nose, but it prevents it from being smoked as it raises the boiling point to a temperature higher than the temperature at which it decomposes.
Cocaine free base is "crack". The lack of the hydrochloride ion keeps the boiling point low enough to allow vaporization (smoking), but prevents it from being effective through insufflation because of its insolubility in water.

No, I really don't. I use it myself and it's really simple if you ask me.


Sure it does. It does so by your paper backup not being a private key, but being a seed for a wallet, which means this seed will generate the same wallet every time its restored using this seed.
The point is that you use Armory to generate the transactions, so you don't have to worry about change addresses.


It's difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the probability of a severe bug being found in Armory. So I won't comment on that. Keep in mind though, that Alan Reiner (the developer of Armory) is also a Bitcoin developer, and he has substantial experience in cryptography.
I agree that the chance that Armory is still being developed in 10 years might not be that great, but thanks to it being open source, this isn't relevant for my use case. Even if Armory development were to stop today, it would still work for the things I use it for.
And if development stops, and use cases arise that it doesn't handle, it's very simple to send your money to your new wallet software that does what you need. You will never be locked into Armory.
Every time I've thought up an attack on Armory and posted it in the thread, I find out he has already thought of that and implemented measures to mitigate it.
It's also worth pointing out that it's written in Python, so certain bug classes are eradicated (like overwriting memory due to the use of pointers).

What you describe there are bank reserves. That's basically just what is on the central bank's balance sheet, ie. what private banks have on deposit with the central bank. This is not money, as we use it. You and I never buy or sell anything with/for bank reserves; these are there for private banks to meet their reserve requirements.

I think Ripple makes a lot of sense. As I understand it, it's basically derived from the observation that miners connect to pools anyway. This means that we're basically affirming our trust in these pools when we use Bitcoin, and not miners.
So Ripple says "why not get rid of the mining part if you trust the pools already?"
I think it makes sense, but whether it's what the market will decide, and whether serious complications will arise, I can't tell.

I'm not saying your theory is right, but you're wrong on one important part: CPUs were not always able to mine at ~2 MH/s per core. This was only after the advent of SHA256 miners written in pure assembly.
The first version used CryptoPP for mining, and was dead slow. I've heard figures that said kilohashes per core, not megahashes.
Here's the original Bitcoin 0.1.0 source code: 
You can see the basic mining loop uses a function that calls CryptoPP:
    void BlockSHA256(const void* pin, unsigned int nBlocks, void* pout)
    {
        unsigned int* pinput = (unsigned int*)pin;
        unsigned int* pstate = (unsigned int*)pout;
        CryptoPP::SHA256::InitState(pstate);
        if (*(char*)&amp;detectlittleendian != 0)
        {
            for (int n = 0; n &lt; nBlocks; n++)
            {
                unsigned int pbuf[16];
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++)
                    pbuf[i] = ByteReverse(pinput[n * 16 + i]);
                CryptoPP::SHA256::Transform(pstate, pbuf);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
                pstate[i] = ByteReverse(pstate[i]);
        }
        else
        {
            for (int n = 0; n &lt; nBlocks; n++)
                CryptoPP::SHA256::Transform(pstate, pinput + n * 16);
        }
    }
This should be *really* slow (compared to an implementation in assembly). Probably an order of magnitude slower.

I'm not sure how this would work. Ideally, a merchant creates a new deposit address for each sale. There would be no way to link this deposit address to an existing address until funds are transferred from this address to one you know, at which point it would be too late to do anything about.
I think a merchant rating system is a fantastic idea, but I'm thinking that already-existing sites like trustpilot.com (and equivalents) are sufficient, as you can't really link an address to a merchant (especially not if that merchant intends to defraud you).

As a comparison, most estimates say there are around 160,000 metric tons of above-ground gold. There are no smaller denominations than 1 gram gold bars, and anything smaller would be almost impossible to handle, *and* carry a huge premium (1 gram gold bars are already 30% more expensive per gram than a 1 kilo gold bar).
So we could say there are 160,000,000,000 indivisible units of gold (160 billion grams). With bitcoin, there will end up being 2,100,000,000,000,000 (2,100 trillion) currency units. So at the current divisibility (which could be changed if people agree on it, which they have no reason not to), bitcoin is 13,125 times more divisible than gold.
The M3 money supply of the dollar is currently around 20 trillion. The smallest denomination is 1/100th of a dollar, which means that bitcoins are currently as divisible as the US Dollar (but it can be changed).

It's fairly simple. ASICMiner has about 20% of the entire Bitcoin mining capacity (3-day average [here]( is 35 TH/s and network hashrate according to [bitcoincharts.com]( is 169 TH/s).
Each block is currently 25 BTC. There are 6 blocks per hour. 24 hours in a day. That's 25\*6\*24 = 3600 BTC per day for the whole network, and ASICMiner gets 20% of that, which is 720 BTC, per day. Currently.
That's 5040 BTC per week. So if we extrapolate to one year (which is really not reliable, since a lot can happen in that time frame), that's 262,080 BTC/yr. Their current market cap is 4.5 BTC/share * 400,000 shares = 1.8M BTC. 
So given mining alone (not hardware sales, which can double income easily) *at the current rate*, and assuming maintenance costs are negligible, they have a P/E ratio of around 1:7 (assuming maintenance and hosting costs are 34,560 BTC / $3M annually (which it totally isn't).
Including hardware sales the P/E is closer to 1:4.
But again, this is using *current* income. It's not based on quarterly results.

Yes, this is a real problem in a debt-based monetary system. It's a result of out monetary system, not the cause of it though.
You can't properly cope with deflation in a debt-based monetary system.


Yes inflation incentivizes people to invest and purchase things they otherwise wouldn't have. I don't think this is positive. Investment is good, but not when you're forced to do it in order to not lose the money you've saved up.
If people are not lending out their savings, the interest rate will rise, and it will encourage people to lend out their savings. It's really simple.
No need to transfer part of my hard-earned savings to banks through inflation to get me to lend it out. I just need to be compensated for the risk I take in the rate of interest I'm given.

You're right. But the good thing is that we can actually calculate how much it'll go up to with current ASIC efficiency.
We know the efficiency of the newest ASICs. Miners will keep adding capacity until their margins are fairly low, say 20% more than their electricity costs.
[Bitfury's new miner only uses 0.8J/GH]( (here it uses 1J/GH, [but they're underclocking the chips in final devices to reach 0.8J/GH]( With an electricity price of $0.1/kWh, that means miners want to make at least $0.12 per kWh spent.
0.8J / GH
1 kWh = 3600000 J
So mining for one day at 1 GH/s at 0.8W / GH/s uses 3600*24*0.8J:
69120J / GH/s for 1 day
which, in kWh, is:
0.0192 kWh / GH/s for 1 day
so to spend 1 kWh per day we can mine at 1/0.0192 GH/s for 1 day:
1 kWh / 52 GH/s for 1 day
52 GH/s for 1 day currently makes $78.53 (at next difficulty of 25.7M)
So in order for it to only produce $0.12 (which miners are willing to go down to), network hash rate would have to increase by a factor of 78.53/0.012 = 6544
So at current ASIC efficiency (using Bitfury as an example), the difficulty will increase to 168 billion (168,000M) until miners' margins are 20% (at current BTC prices).
This will bring the network hashrate up to 1243 PH/s (1,243,360 TH/s)

There is nothing in the Bitcoin protocol that enforces any level of fees. It's completely up to miners which transactions they want to include. So it's just the various wallets - including Bitcoin Qt - that are lagging behind.
The thing is that letting users set the fee as they wish requires some other changes, such as transaction replacement. This enables you to replace a previous transaction with one with a higher fee, so you don't risk your transaction never being confirmed.
If you think it's going too slow, either donate to the Bitcoin developers or to an independent third party developer who can write the necessary code, or test existing solutions.

Thousands of people voluntarily choosing to run a program on their computer comprises the Bitcoin network.
If a change is proposed they don't like, they won't run the program, and the network will be split in two, effectively creating two distinct crypto currencies.
It's like BitTorrent. The BitTorrent protocol can be changed at any time, but that doesn't mean people will use it. If they think it's worse, they will just continue to run the same version of uTorrent that they already do (or use a different BitTorrent client), but won't be able to download torrents from the people who are running the upgraded version.
The BitTorrent network would effectively be split in two, and the two networks wouldn't be able to share data with each other.
The same would happen for Bitcoin if a controversial change is implemented and people disagree on what the best protocol is.

What are you talking about? You pair the device and your phone with a cable. You send an unsigned transaction from the phone to the device, the device signs the transaction, and sends it back to the phone that broadcasts it. Whether that happens wirelessly, through a wire, or by it printing out a slip that you mail to some dude in Australia who types it into  brainwallet.org's transaction broadcaster, doesn't really matter. The worst thing that could happen is that it wouldn't get broadcast.

I can confirm that ASICMiner, on average, includes fewer transactions in their blocks. I wrote a script that scans blocks starting from ASICMiner's first solo block (000000000000010c9335c90f6e1f2d2a9af73ca078d660c98988234309b9dba3) up to the current block. This ran about two weeks ago:
    Analyzed 7,141 blocks containing 2,023,595 transactions.
    -----Stats-----:
    ASICMiner stats (1190 blocks, 232779 transaction):
	    Average transaction count per block: 195.6
	    Maximum number of transactions in a block: 1323
	    Minimum fee: -0.00000000
	    Average fee: 0.00084612
	    Average fees per block: 0.1655
    Other blocks stats (5951 blocks, 1790816 transaction):
	    Average transaction count per block: 300.9
	    Maximum number of transactions in a block: 1333
	    Minimum fee: -0.00000000
	    Average fee: 0.00089534
	    Average fees per block: 0.2694
So ASICMiner blocks contain, on average, only 65% the number of transactions included in other blocks. And they only get around 60% the fees that other blocks get.

Yeah, just found (I actually read the report!) that it set up a custom mining pool server.
Would have made more sense to just let the machines solo mine and send the encrypted private key back to the owner, IMO. In fact, if they solo mine, they *need* to either mine to a new address, or alter the coinbase, or it won't be recognized by the network since it will have the same hash as the other generation transactions.

I know nothing about this algorithm, but I would assume the right way to do it would be to do the split the raw data (private key) before any encoding is applied. So you split the secret (256 bit key), and then get a 4-byte checksum for each split key, add the checksum to the end and an optional [version byte]( to the beginning (someone that's not already used), and then end with base58 encoding.
So it would look like:
    Secret key -&gt; Split -&gt; Checksum -&gt; Base58
I see no reason to do a checksum before the split. If each part is valid then the combined secrets will be valid.

Here's the explanation: 
A watching-only wallet system consists of two keys: a private key (that never leaves the offline wallet) and a "chain code" key.
You start by generating a "master" public key - on the offline device - by multiplying the private key (a number) by the generator point on the EC curve:
    P=priv_key*G
This master public key is then sent to the watching-only wallet computer.
Now, to compute a new public key, you simply multiply the "master" public key with n\*&lt;chain_code&gt;, where *n* increases by 1 for every new public key/address you want, so the public key becomes:
    (n*&lt;chain_code&gt;)*P=(n*&lt;chain_code&gt;)*priv_key*G
The private key for this public key is:
    (n*&lt;chain_code&gt;)*priv_key
So you can find a new public key without revealing the private key (priv_key) because P=priv_key*G, and you can't derive a private key from a public key (P).

I have used Bitfinex with success (I live in Northern Europe). Sold some bitcoins for USD and it arrived in my account after two business days. They charge 0.1% if you only use their order book, and don't route the trade on to Bitstamp (you can choose whether you want to do this when creating an order under "Advanced").
That being said, they don't have as much liquidity as Mt. Gox or Bitstamp, but still sufficient liquidity for me.

Wrong. You don't know what odds you get on Bets of Bitcoin. Firstly, someone could come in after you and bet a huge amount on the same side of the bet as you, effectively ruining the odds *you* get. It could have looked like 3:1 odds, but someone coming in after could reduce that to 1.1:1 if he bets enough (on the same side of the bet as you).
Secondly, Bets of Bitcoin uses some arbitrary "time weight" so that early bettors get more. So the closer you get to the time line the less you win if you win.

As others have said, we *really* need an Intrade-style prediction market for bitcoin.

An address containing 50 BTC means that other transactions contain a number of outputs (with a sum of 50 BTC) that point to that address. A transaction that sends 1 BTC to another address would look like this (figuratively):
    Redeem output 0 of txid 4ae82e42d716adaede7f5fa8dc55338c5cee6f69816aaf3c6257cb3f5cecd139 (50 BTC to 1JpE9uzXit4tNmc6jEJrUpN6WmmV1k7btN)
    Send 1 BTC to 1AjgTd4wbF438iDfkLPtLpgW77z5ejdP3c
    send 49 BTC to 1JpE9uzXit4tNmc6jEJrUpN6WmmV1k7btN
This transaction would send 1 BTC to 1AjgTd4wbF438iDfkLPtLpgW77z5ejdP3c and send the rest (49 BTC) back to the sending address (1JpE9uzXit4tNmc6jEJrUpN6WmmV1k7btN) and leave no fee for miners.
If you make a transaction that looks like this instead:
    Redeem output 0 of txid 4ae82e42d716adaede7f5fa8dc55338c5cee6f69816aaf3c6257cb3f5cecd139 (50 BTC to 1JpE9uzXit4tNmc6jEJrUpN6WmmV1k7btN)
    Send 1 BTC to 1AjgTd4wbF438iDfkLPtLpgW77z5ejdP3c
You will send 1 BTC to 1AjgTd4wbF438iDfkLPtLpgW77z5ejdP3c and the transaction will have a 49 BTC fee.
This format is used for two reason:
1. It saves space by not explicitly stating the miner's fee (the miner's fee equals the total sum of inputs minus the total sum of outputs)
2. It discourages re-use of addresses, which enhances anonymity

People forget that ASICMiner was the second company (after Avalon) to deploy Bitcoin mining ASICs. Now, around 6 months later, we have two additional companies that are shipping (BFL and BitFury), and countless more companies with chips in the pipeline.
Barring some form of government protection (like the x86 patent owned by Intel), no producer of mining chips will ever be able to gain over 50% of the network again.
And this is good! Remember the 51% attack is a serious one, and we should be glad that no company will be able to generate that amount of hashing power in the future. ASICMiner's ability to perform a 51% attack was a glitch on the radar, as they just happened to be one of the first companies to develop a Bitcoin ASIC. It will most likely not happen again. But if it does, it will in all likelihood not be ASICMiner with their 2nd gen 55nm chips.

The Bitcoin addresses that most people use, that start with "1", are a hash of a public key. In order to redeem coins sent to such an address, you must be able to present a signature, made with a private key whose corresponding public key hashes to the hash contained in that address.
With PS2H addresses (these addresses starts with "3"), the address contains a hash, not of a public key, but of a script. You must be able to present a script that hashes to the hash contained in the address, in order to redeem (spend) the coins sent to that address.
This is an example of a PS2H address:

This is another common misconception. Or, at least, it's a misconception when applied to hard money (as opposed to elastic money).
The only way to save up money is to produce more value (measured in money) than you consume. When you do this we all get richer. This is manifested in falling prices (deflation).
Let's take a hypothetical example where a large corporation is able to earn one half of the entire money supply (let's say we use Bitcoins). This half of all the bitcoins in existence would be removed from the economy, hoarded by that company. What would happen then?
The effect would be lower prices, because the supply of Bitcoins traversing the economy would drop, while the supply of goods and services wouldn't be affected by this company holding money. This would benefit *all* holders of money, since they are now, in effect, richer, because they can buy more stuff with the money they already have.
In fact, the holders of money can now both buy the stuff they could afford before, *and* invest money in companies, because the stuff they wanted to buy before is now cheaper.
The net effect is that the purchasing power of the money hoarded by the corporation is now put into the hands of those who hold the same money.

Bitcoin Qt creates 100 change addresses in your wallet when it starts up the first time. You can change this in your `bitcoin.conf`. So if you back up your wallet you'll be good for 100 transactions until your backup doesn't contain the new change addresses.

How are the interest payments funded?
If I deposit 1,000 BTC to the exchange and don't trade, how can they keep paying me interest on these? The BTC are nothing but a liability to them, unless they loan them out to other people.
**EDIT:** I see my question is answered here: 
* **Interest** on deposits - 25% of the mcxNOW exchange fees go towards paying interest on deposits every 6 hours. This is calculated as such :- (YOUR_BALANCE / TOTAL_USER_BALANCE) * 25% of fees. This applies to every currency on the exchange.
So the interest rate is not a fixed percentage, but rather a percentage of fees.

Yep, very much of a gamble. I sincerely considered bidding, but it really was a gamble. So many unknowns, especially now that BFL seems to be shipping units, albeit slowly.
If you hold BTC and plan to continue to hold those BTC for the next year or so, the BTC price will not be relevant. If you make back the BTC you spent on the device, you have the same amount of BTC that you started with, regardless of the price.
If you plan on cashing out as you mine, then the price will have an influence, but not if you plan to keep the BTC.

A part of this might be due to options held on btct.co.

If the trend continues, then in 5 years we'll have 50TB HDDs that cost less than 4 TB HDDs do today.


4 TB hard drives are normal now. So in 5 years (60 months) (if the trend continues) we should be able to buy a 80 TB (2^(60/14) * 4TB) hard drive for the current price of a 4 TB HDD.
Remember that 10 years ago, a 120GB HDD cost roughly $160.00. You can get a 3 TB HDD for [$135 today]( That's a factor 30 increase in GB/$ 10 years. Using that metric, we should be able to buy a 85 TB HDD in 10 years for the price of a 3 TB HDD today.

I wouldn't call Bitcoin a fiat currency. Why do you think it is?
According to [Wikipedia]( a fiat currency constitutes:
* any money declared by a government to be legal tender.
* state-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
* money without intrinsic value.
Bitcoin isn't legal tender. It's non-convertible because it's not a debt instrument (like the dollar was), so it's like gold in that sense (which isn't a fiat currency either). And I've never really understood the concept of "intrinsic value". As far as I can see, value can never be intrinsic - it's inherently subjective.

No, the transaction does not have to be standard. Blocks with non-standard transactions are not rejected by the network; they are just not relayed by Bitcoin Qt nodes.

Why can't Bitcoin itself become the better crypto currency of the future? Bitcoin is not static. The protocol has been updated several times over its life span. This can continue if new developments happen in this area.
Remember, a crypto currency has to be open source. People simply won't trust a black box - that's even worse than fiat currencies.
This means Bitcoin can use whatever new technologies its competitors will use, but with its longer history and larger market it will always have an advantage to its competitors.

If all the coins were bought by filling a single ask, as OP seems to be saying, there was no slippage.
But I can't find the trade that OP references.
The highest volume single trade I can find happened 12 seconds before that:
    2013-11-05 16:21:51 254 492.95216832 (tid: 1383668511409107)
(the format is &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;price&gt; &lt;volume&gt;)
Seems like the buying spree started at `2013-11-05 16:21:18` UTC and ended at `2013-11-05 16:22:03`. Between these two timestamps there are several trades every second.
The last trade here (1383668523502883) seems to be a filling of a bid, while the others fill asks.
In this sequence of trades, it seems only asks are eaten up, and a total of 4000.02 BTC are exchanged.
In this period the price moves from 248.99999 to 257.59493. A total of $1.01M USD was paid for these bitcoins. If they were all bought at 248.99999 it would have cost the buyer only $996,005 USD. So the slippage seems to have been $15,115, or 1.5%.

+1 for Armory.
Here's what I would do: open up Offline Armory on an offline computer. Import the private key in question into Offline Armory. Export a "watch-only wallet" from the wallet into which you imported the private key. Transfer this "watch-only wallet" to an online computer via a USB drive, and run Online Armory on the online computer, and import the watch-only wallet into it. Now try to create a transaction that spends funds from that address, and transfer the unsigned transaction to the offline PC. On the offline PC you can sign this transaction in question, and if it works, you can spend the funds in the address. Just don't publish the transaction you've signed, simply discard it.

When we talk about "price" in daily life, we are referring to the price in the *spot market* price as opposed to the price in the futures market. A spot market is defined as:


The reason we differentiate between the two is that there is a difference in price between a good delivered now and a good delivered in the future. You can observe this by watching the price difference between the spot market and the futures market. An example would be the price of wheat right before harvest, when he reserves are low, and the price right after harvest when it's abundant. It should be obvious why people don't want to pay as much for wheat in a month, when they know it will be abundant, as they are willing to right now.
When you buy a good (in this case US Dollars) that is not available for immediate delivery, the selling and buying of this good is not part of the spot market; it happens on the futures market.
This is exactly why we see a (as of this writing) 12% price difference between bitcoins on Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, denominated in US Dollars; they are not the same market. One is a futures market (an ill-defined one, without a set expiration date) and the other is a spot market.
So yes, the Mt. Gox USD price *is* a valid one, it's just not what we usually refer to as "the price" of something.

As far as I can see, right now we have a centralized system where everything goes through banks. It's fairly simple to regulate (just go after the banks).

If I recall correctly, a single core of my Core 2 Quad 2.83 GHz CPU spends around 1.3 ms verifying a single ECDSA signature in Bitcoin Qt. So that's around 3000 signatures per second for my CPU.
But bear in mind that you need to verify a signature for each *input* of a transaction. And a transaction can have many inputs.  [This one]( for example, has 22 inputs. So this transactions would require 22 ECDSA signature verifications to validate.

Among other things, this statement is paradoxical. Think about it... how is this scenario possible? If it were true that deflation prevented bitcoins from being spent, people wouldn't accept them. Well guess what happens when people don't accept bitcoins: they decrease in value. So now the price deflation (decreasing prices) is supposedly causing price *in*flation. And if you argue that inflation causes people to want to spend, BAM, the situation will solve itself.

IPOs are a often-used method for taking out credit in the Bitcoin community. ASICMiner, for example, sold around 160,000 shares to fund the development of an ASIC Bitcoin mining chip. That went quite well.

As far as I can see, the BTC price was around 13.51 USD on January 1st 2013: 
Gold price opened at 1680 USD on January 1st: 
BTC: 13.51 USD
Gold: 1680 USD
Example outcomes and results:
* Gold closes at 2100 USD on December 31st 2013. This constitutes a 25% increase in price. Bitcoin closes at 20 USD on December 31st 2013. This is a ~48% increase in price. **I win.**
* Gold closes at 2500 USD on December 31st 2013. This constitutes a ~49% increase in price. Bitcoin closes at 20 USD on December 31st 2013. This is a ~48% increase in price. **You win.**

But then wouldn't an attacker only have to look through a 128 bit space to crack a private key? I presume the "well known sequence" is public. So to get your private key an attacker would "just" have to loop through all 2^128 possible combinations of "seed" to get your private key, right? I mean, you can't get 256 bit entropy from 128 bits.
Of course, even 128 bits is a *huge* address space, and it's not possible - with current computers - to brute force that. But it does reduce the entropy to 128 bits, right?
I mean, I get that you can derive 256 bits from any number of bits using SHA256. But the resulting key would only have the entropy of the input to SHA256, not the output, I'd claim.

So you'd rather have ASICMiner sell below market prices, and have resellers earn the difference by putting them up on eBay? Because that's the only alternative. If people are willing to buy something for X and it's sold for Y, then - if Y is less than X - people will buy it for Y and sell it for X, why wouldn't they?
I think it makes more sense for ASICMiner to sell at the prices they can get, instead of letting random resellers earn the profit.

Why would you do that? You don't need rapidly updating micro-transactions in a store. That's what the mentioned proposal is for. Here's the link to the YouTube video where Mike explains it: 
In the case of buying something in a store, you just load your bitcoin account, at whichever intermediary you wish, with bitcoins, wait for that to show in your account (the time to wait is determined by the intermediary), and then pay the store with funds from that account. The store will have to trust the intermediary to not double spend, of course. But the intermediary doesn't need to provide a whole payment processing infrastructure like VISA or Mastercard, so the barrier to entry is about as low as it gets, and you'll pay tiny fees as a result (unless some politician gets the bright idea of regulating this, because VISA hires a bunch of lobbyists to delay their inevitable downfall).

If they are calculating numbers they should be able to account for, exactly, how they reached these numbers. They haven't. All they've done is give a reference to some methodology that was allegedly used in 1980.
If they want people to believe their numbers, they should lay out *exactly* how they reached these figures. Which goods/services have risen that much in price per year and how does that add up to 4% p.a. inflation?

There is no regulator with authority over the entire world. So it would only affect the miners in the country in question.

I think Zerocoin holds great potential, but it's simply too immature a technology right now to be used in Bitcoin, in my opinion.

Here's one way:
Say you have the throws "14654133". The value will then be:

You start by reversing the list of throws (so it becomes "33145641"), then multiply the first number by 6^0, and the second number by 6^1 and the third number by 6^2 and so on, and then add all these together.

Linux runs fine on ARM CPUs. I have it (Ubuntu) running on my Samsung ARM Chromebook. The problem is that for ARM, you need a kernel (the heart of the OS) made specifically for that device, not just the CPU. Luckily the Chromebook comes with a kernel already, because Chrome OS uses the Linux kernel, but Android uses a modified version of the Linux kernel that is not compatible with Ubuntu. So unless someone has successfully made a kernel for this particular device, you won't be able to run Ubuntu on it.
This is the cool thing about Linux. It runs on practically all platforms. Here are the currently supported CPU architectures:


It's open source, so you can just build it for whatever platform you use, unlike Windows, where you have to ask Microsoft kindly to build it for a certain platform (CPU architecture).

Shadowstats produces a figure called the CPI (Consumer Price Index). This is used to adjust prices for inflation (how much purchasing power a currency unit loses over time). Shadowstats' CPI figure was used to calculate the inflation-adjusted gold price in the chart you posted above. Shadowstats' CPI figure is sketchy at best.

You're talking about bank reserves versus currency. Commercial banks transfer reserves to each other when settling inter-bank transfers. But these reserves are not money, since they cannot be used to pay for anything in the real economy; they can only be used to settle transactions between banks, and between the banks and the central bank.
Reserves are what is created in the case of QE, which is when the central bank swaps an asset on the bank's balance sheet with reserves (ie. the bank "sells" an asset (Treasury bond/MBS) and is credited with reserve money in its account with the central bank).

There is no well-defined time period as such. But the more confirmations the transaction has the harder it will be to reverse it - as always. If the reward is substantial enough, miners could even pick the transaction out of a previously mined block, and mine their own block which replaces the already mined block.

No you're not. Quite the contrary. Those who want to change the proof-of-work hashing algorithm are the minority. I get a feeling that they have a dream of everyone participating with their CPU. I don't think it will ever happen, in the long run. Everything is optimizable. A CPU will always be the worst, most inefficient device to fulfill a purpose - that's why they're general purpose.
Even if we choose scrypt with a large memory usage as the proof-of-work hashing function, dedicated hardware *will* appear sooner or later.
And if the dedicated hardware is only 2x as efficient (I think it will be more efficient) and miners have a 20% profit margin with this hardware, it will push out CPU miners who will be mining at a loss.

Everything is good as long as it is managed well. The question is how hard it is to manage well. Inflation is not some thing you can turn up and down with the touch of a button. If inflation gets too high, fear might set in, and people will rid themselves of the currency, causing increased inflation, thus leading to a vicious cycle.
A falling price of a currency is a very different beast from, for example, a stock falling in price. When you own a stock you actually own a piece of a company. If the stock price falls to zero you can buy a company and its assets for $0 and sell it on the market for a profit. With a currency you don't own anything. It only has its worth if people believe in it.
Trying to "manage" inflation is playing with fire, and I think it will go wrong if Japan attempts this route.

Yes it does. Because the greater the time between blocks, the greater the difficulty needs to be.
Example: We have a network that operates at 10 TH/s. A 1-minute block time for this network would require each miner, on average, to produce 600 \* 10^12 \* 2^32 hashes to find a block (10 TH/s \* 60 seconds * 2^32 hashes) at difficulty 1.
If this 10 TH/s network uses a 10-minute block time, the difficulty would need to be 10 times higher, and thus a miner would need, on average, to search **10** \* 600 \* 10^12 \* 2^32 hashes to find a valid block.
So, the greater the block time the greater the amount of work that needs to go into every block, assuming the same network hashrate. So every block in our 10-minute block time system requires 10 times the amount of work to find compared to the 1-minute block time system.
So to find 6 blocks in a row in the 1-minute block time system would require 1/10th of the work, on average, compared to the 10-minute block time system.

No, not necessarily. The point is that if you eat up an order on the order book, you get charged 0.7%. If you add an order to the order book, you get a 0.1% rebate when someone eats up that order.
So if the order book looks like this:
    SIZE	BID		ASK		SIZE
    ----------------------------
    				352.0	4.0
    				351.0	5.0
    				350.1	1.5
    4.0		349.9
    5.0		349.5
    3.5		349.4
And you place a limit buy order for 1 bitcoin at 350.1 you get charged 0.7% because you ate up an ask on the order book. If, however, you place a limit buy order for 1 bitcoin at 350.0, your order would be added to the order book, and you'd get a 0.1% rebate if someone else eats up your ask.

Bear in mind that innovation does not stop after *x* nm is reached. ASIC designs can still be optimized, we will just not see the crazy 100-1000 fold increase in power efficiency that we're seeing now when going from GPUs to ASICs. Think of it like Intel's tick-tock strategy, where we see increases in performance because of a newer design, even if it uses the same process technology.
The difference between CPUs and Bitcoin ASICs, though, is that CPUs are very far in development. We've had several decades to figure out how to design a CPU. Bitcoin mining ASICs are a completely new area of chip development. Before Bitcoin there was no reason to create a chip that can calculate billions of SHA256 hashes per second.
That being said, Bitcoin ASICs are a lot simpler than CPUs, so the time it takes to reach the upper limit on efficiency and speed at a certain feature size probably isn't as great as with CPUs.


Intel is the only company producing 22 nm chips in volume. No one is making 15 nm processors yet (in volume). 15/14 nm is still at the reasearch stage.

Always keep in mind that whatever you have on an exchange is you loaning out funds to that exchange. If you have BTC in an exchange, you've effectively given up the ownership of your BTC and have an amount of BTC *owed to you* by the exchange. The same with USD.
Many people have been burned by not realizing this, and keeping BTC at an exchange that was later hacked or closed down, making them unable to repay the debt. This, effectively, is an exchange defaulting on their debt owed to their customers.

What about simply increasing the connectivity of all other miners?
As far as I can see they have not demonstrated that it's even possible to simply "out-connect" all other miners, and publish a block *after* a new block it received, and have it received by other miners *before* the other block. This is not at all obviously possible to me.
All miners already have an incentive to be connected to the greatest number of peers. The more peers they are connected to the greater the chance that their block reaches the most people before a new block is found.

The matching engine should pair him up with the highest bid at or above €1/BTC. If not, it's cheating both the seller and potential buyers who have higher bids, and arbitrarily rewarding someone with a bid at €1.

Let me clarify. The "work" for a particular block is its target. It doesn't matter how much lower than the target a block's hash is, its work (according to the Bitcoin protocol in its current form) will always be equal to the target.
So a block chain with two blocks at 100M difficulty will still be a chain with more work than a chain with 1000 blocks at difficulty 1.
But a chain with two blocks with a difficulty of 100M with the hashes:
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032

will have less "work" than a chain with three blocks at difficulty 100M.
In other words, how much less than the target a block's hash is is not used in determining its amount of "work", and thus the cumulative amount of work in the chain it is present in. Only the block's target is used for this.
So the sum of work for a chain is the sum of each block's target in the chain.

If it's managed properly, and there is no duration mismatch, this is not a problem. If you deposit $100 into an account where they a locked for 1 year, and Bob is given a $90 1-year loan, no extra money has been created. Bob is simply using "your money" while they are on deposit, earning an interest. The problem is duration mismatch (when you risk your depositors demanding their money before your loans are paid back), and not fractional reserve banking.

Think about it this way: the entire Bitcoin network has only done around 2^72 hashes. Ever. So this makes 72 bit hash functions less secure, as someone with the historical hashing power of the entire Bitcoin network could calculate the data for a certain hash if he used 4 years.
But SHA256 is 256 bits, so it'd require 2^184 times more hashing power (or time) to do the same with SHA256. This simply isn't possible with the amount of energy in our solar system.

This isn't really a part of the protocol that can be enforced.

It *does* verify past transactions. Every block added to the block chain makes it harder to perform a double spend against a transaction in the block chain. The longer chain wins, and the more blocks that are appended to the block containing a transaction, the more work it will require to produce a longer chain containing a double spend.
The usually recommended 6 confirmations was chosen by Satoshi simply because 6 confirmations is what is required for an attacker with 10% of the network hashrate to have less than a 0.1% chance of a successful double spend.

How do you get it down to *42!* exactly?
**EDIT:** I think I get it now. You don't actually have to make *49!* combinations, because the last four bytes are actually derived from the first 33 bytes of the payload (1 version byte, 32 byte number, 4 byte hash). So you can reduce it by only shuffling 49 possible characters into 44 possible locations, and then reconstructing a part of the original payload, and append the last 5-6 characters from the hash of the payload to the end.

Let's say Bitpay holds a lot of bitcoins, but it would like insurance against something bad happening, and the price dropping too much.
With these instruments, Bitpay can sell a contract for "Bitcoin to be above $100", and if the price drops to below $100 on the day of settlement (can differ between contracts), Bitpay can keep the money it sold the contracts for (currently the price for this specific contract is $88).
So say Bitpay has 10,000 bitcoins, and it would like to minimize its losses in case of a large drop (to below $100). Current bitcoin price is $200, let's say, and it sells 10,000 "Bitcoin to be above $100"-contracts for the current price of 88 per contract. This earns Bitpay $880,000 ($88 per contract times 10,000 contracts). If the bitcoin price is above $100 at the end of the contract's expiration date (May 31 currently), the price of the contract becomes 100, and Bitpay has to buy back those contracts at $100 per contract, thus losing $12 per contract, or $120,000. So $120,000 is the price it costs Bitpay to insure against a price drop to below $100 per bitcoin.
If, however, the price of bitcoins drops to below $100, the contracts' price drop to 0, and Bitpay can "buy back" those contracts for $0, and it still has the $880,000 it made from selling the contracts (10,000 contracts at $88 per contract), thus only losing $1,120,000 (10,000 bitcoins at $200 per bitcoin minus $880,000) instead of losing everything (the $2,000,000 the bitcoins were worth in case the price drops to zero), or losing $2,000,000 minus (10,000 times the price of one bitcoin at May 31st plus the $880,000 it sold the contracts for).
So, effectively, Bitpay can insure itself against losses on holding bitcoins, by paying a premium, which is determined by the market participants selling and buying these contracts.
You could do exactly the same for everyday insurance stuff like against your house burning down. You could say "I would like to buy a contract that becomes worth $200,000 in case my house burns down within the next year, what price are you guys willing to sell that to me for?". Someone offers to sell you this contract for, let's say, $200. You buy this contract, and if your house burns down the seller has to buy it back for $200,000, and if it doesn't you lose the $200 but still have an un-burnt house. So you effectively paid $200 to insure against your house burning down within the next year. After the contract expires you go into the market to buy a new contract so your house is also insured the next year. A "clearing house" will make sure that whoever sold you the contract has enough money to pay you in case your house burns down (that's their job), by forcing the seller to keep an amount of cash at his account with the clearing house.

According to Wikipedia, the Cray XK7:


So that's 500\*24\*4 = 48000 GPUs and CPUs
The [Mining hardware comparison page]( on the Bitcoin wiki says a single Tesla K20 gets 134.8 Mhash/s.
So that's 48000*134.8 = 6470400 Mhash/s, or 6.47 Thash/s from the GPUs.
The CPU can probably get around 3 Mhash/s per core. So per 16-core CPU that's 48 Mhash/s, and for 48000 CPUs that amounts to 2.3 Thash/s.
So a rough estimate would be around 9 Thash/s for the full-size Cray XK7.
If the GPUs and CPUs are clocked higher, this will increase the number a bit, but not by much.
Wikipedia also informs of the power usage:


So if we take 50 kW per cabinet as our number, that's 500*50 = 25000 kW for 9 Thash/s, or an efficiency of 0.36 Mhash/J, which is around 300 times worse than the average ASIC.
Mining at 9 Thash/s right now would produce [$46,656.35 per day](
This means that if you're mining with this super computer, and pay more than approximately 0.07776 $/kWh for your power to this super computer, you're wasting money. If you pay just that you're breaking even - no profit.

Right now free electricity isn't really an advantage. GPUs are quickly becoming obsolete, and the ASIC miners are so efficient that electricity usage doesn't matter (right now). What matters right now is being able to get hold of an ASIC miner device. That's hard and/or expensive. Bitcoin mining is quickly becoming a low margin business, which is what it should be (we don't want to over-compensate miners).
I predict that in a couple of years, ASIC miners will be abundant and cheap, and electricity costs will be a substantial part of the expenses of mining. When/if that day comes, you'll have an advantage of having free electricity.
Right now, electricity costs are like 1% of the overall cost, the 99% being hardware. You don't have an advantage because you can get rid of that 1% expenditure on electricity.

    0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
divided by the current target:
    0x0000000000000089680000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
is 31256960.7278
We can calculate this more easily by cutting off the leading and trailing zero bits:
0xFFFF000000 / 0x0000008968 = 0x1DCF180.BA4F1097D = 31256960.727768933₁₀

No, it's not about that. It's about whether you add liquidity (your order ends up on the order book) or take liquidity (your order is matched with an existing order on the order book).
Market orders necessarily eat up an order on the order book. Limit orders only match an order on the order book if the price limit you've specified matches with an order on the order book, if not, your order is added to the order book.

We can't make the total numbers of bitcoins in circulation reach a pre-set value unless no reward is made from forked blocks. And if we have a block every second, then almost all the blocks from poorly connected peers would be forked blocks, so they'd have a huge disadvantage, as far as I can see.

That's wrong. You don't reveal your private key when you publish a transaction. If you did, anyone could snatch up that private key, and use it to redeem the money in your address and send it to themselves.
You create a signature using your private key, which can be verified using the corresponding public key.

Good point.
There was a story in the newspapers here in Denmark recently, about a German guy who wanted to sell Cuban cigars to a Dane. Since the cigars were bought for cash USD in Cuba, they opted to settle the transaction in USD. So the Dane sent the USD to the German ($26,000 in total), and expected the cigars in return. But when sending USD, the transfer *has* to go through a US bank, and the US bank saw it was payment for a product from Cuba, and seized the funds, on request from the US authorities (because of their embargo against Cuba).
The Dane's Danish bank has since reimbursed the loss, but the bank still stands with a loss of $26,000.

If that order was fulfilled it means it had higher priority than yours. When the limit price was the same as yours, this can happen for at least two reasons.
The first reason being that this order was placed before yours (this is probably the case). The second reason being that Mt. Gox has some other rules for priorities in order execution (like larger orders getting a higher priority).
For example, if the top of the buy side book looks like this:
| Price   | Amount    | Time     |
| 750        |          130|     22:00     
| 750  |    1|  22:10

No. There is no maximum difficulty (it's infinite). The highest possible difficulty before infinity, using the current Bitcoin protocol, is around 2^(224), or, more accurately, 26959535291011309493156476344723991336010898738574164086137773096960.
If we develop mining chips that are a trillion times as efficient as the ones we use today, finding a single block at this difficulty would require - on average - 3.21639784 × 10^37 petawatt hours, or over 10³⁵ times the current worldwide annual energy production[\[1\]](
On average, it would require capturing the total energy production of the sun for 9546768134043474372156 years[\[2\]]( But, of course, this can't be done, as the sun will die long before that.
**TL;DR:** We either need to invent a new form of computer chip or travel to another solar system for the current limits on difficulty in the Bitcoin protocol to be a problem.

Care to share your comparison? I haven't seen any competitors with a substantially larger efficiency. ASICMiner uses 130nm chips that get around 125 Mhash/J. Butterfly Labs' Jalapeño gets [around 170 Mhash/J]( [Avalon is 107 Mhash/J](
KNCMiner claim they will get at least 400 Mhash/J on 28 nm (presumably because it's just an FPGA hardcopy/structured ASIC). But they're not set to be released until September. And ASICMiner says their 65nm chips will be released in October, at the earliest. So if for two months (let's say) they are behind on power usage by a factor of around 3, I think they'll manage.

Sure you have. In order to hoard you first have to save up in order to buy the bitcoins. In order to save up you must consume less than you produce (spend less money than you earn).
You are doing a society a favor acting this way. Thanks to you, products become cheaper priced in bitcoins, because you consume less than you produce, thus increasing the supply of goods. Thanks to the hoarders, a poor person can put his money into bitcoins today, and buy more goods for the same amount of bitcoins at a later point.

They haven't addressed the 1 MB limit. This only affects the default value of `-maxblocksize`, which was 250 KB previously (IIRC), which is now 350 KB, by default.

Don't buy bitcoins by buying private keys. Anyone not willing to send you the money, to a key you own yourself, isn't to be trusted with your money IMO.

I think it will be the opposite. The is a lot of money in developing ASICs right now. I think at least 10 companies are trying to develop ASICs.

There is, but it gets smaller and smaller every day. At the the end of the day, the Fed (or any central bank) is deeply dependent on its government maintaining the legal framework that gives it a competitive advantage (legal tender law, capital gains tax), so it has no incentive to piss off the government too much.
The only thing that separates the Fed and the government are laws. And government is the one who passes laws, so when it wants to give itself more power, it does (in democracies, usually only with the approval of the electorate, though).
I think we will see a decreasing independence of the Fed in the future. It has become a too important tool for politicians to be left to as an independent entity.

As far as I can see, the added amount of fees from trying to orphan a single block you want to "steal" a transaction from must be more than:
    25/p-50
for it to be profitable, where *p* denotes your network share (eg. *p*=0.1 is 10% network share).
Of course this equation only makes sense if your network share is no greater than 50% (p&lt;=0.5), or else you'd be able to steal transactions from all blocks (since you have the majority network hashrate).
Here's the deduction. *p* is the network share (eg. 1% network share is *p*=0.01):
This is the probability of finding a single block:
    p =	0.01
This is the probability of finding two blocks in a row:
    p^2 =	0.0001
This is what you will earn, on average, per block found (because you only find 1 out of 100 blocks when you have 1% network share):
    p_rew =		0.01 * 25 = 	0.250 BTC
This is what you would have to earn for finding two blocks in order for it to be as profitable as finding a single block:
    p^2_rew = 	0.25 / 0.0001 =	2500	BTC
Since the block reward is 25 BTC per block, you'd need 2500 BTC - 50 BTC = 2450 BTC in fees for it to be as profitable to try to find two blocks in a row as finding a single block when you have 1% of the network share.
We can generalize this equation:
    p_rew = p * 25
    p^2_rew = p_rew / p^2
    p^2_rew = (p * 25) / p^2
    p^2_rew = 25/p
    min_fees = 25/p - 50

Yep. ASICMiner can't keep up with the increase in network hashrate (and, hence, difficulty). Here's a look at their mining revenue: 
It's been falling fairly constantly for the past many weeks.
If you look further up on that page you can see that their hashrate hasn't fallen much, it's just the network getting faster.
At the rate of difficulty increases we're experiencing now, ASICMiner simply cannot keep up. I did a calculation earlier that shows that ASICMiner needs to install 4.5 blades each hour, 24/7 to keep their hashrate at 10% of the network. And this figure increases by about 25% each 11 days. This simply isn't possible.
Until they have second generation chips ready, I think we will continue to see a decline in the dividends paid out.

I think the right question to ask is how a mistake from a single group of people (analysts) can lead to a potential global meltdown of the economy.
Is that what you call a resilient economy/"financial sector so efficient"?
To me, it's irrelevant what the actual mistake was. The point is that a system in which the errors of a few people can make the whole system crumble is not a system worth supporting.
I prefer a system where mistakes cause a firm to dissolve in bankruptcy, rather than a system that supports these firms and allows them to grow so big that the consequences of their future mistakes become unmanageable large.

This is not the case with the monetary asset. Money cannot - provided it is sufficiently divisible - become too expensive. Money is valuable because it can be exchanged for other goods. Expensive money means it can buy a lot of goods. That's not a weakness, it's a strength. On the other hand, cheap money is easy to create. Anyone can create a currency that will be cheap.

I've dumped mine, but YMMV.
The price is at 50% of the peak (5 BTC), and their earnings are more than halved. When they earned the most, they were selling hundreds of Blades at 50 BTC. Now they're selling Blades for 3.5 BTC. Their earnings have been reduced by much more than one half. Even if their fair valuation back then was only 4.0, it'd still need to go below 2.0 for the valuation to remain in line with reduced earnings.

It would be cool if you could use the country-specific data for the world map. So instead of coloring all of the US purple (including Alaska), you would plot in the cities you have from the country-specific data on the world map. The larger the concentration in a city, the darker the color of that city.
That would probably make, for example, Alaska and the Northern parts of Canada, a lot less dominant, which would reflect reality a lot better.
As the world map is now, it's basically a 200-pixel image, with each pixel having varying sizes and shapes, and some being spread out over separate areas (like Alaska and Hawaii for the US). It's very low resolution.

First of all, the wordlist.asc file uses "\r

    words = [x.strip('\r

This fixes the bug mentioned.

I've used [bitcoinsaresexy.com]( on two occasions to buy USD in my PayPal account with bitcoin. Works great. But you pay both a fee to bitcoinsaresexy.com and PayPal (when receiving the money).
For $1025 I bought $1000 PayPal USD, which was reduced to $950.70 when they arrived in my account (because of PayPal fees). So that's a 7.25% fee in total.
Buying $200 worth of PayPal USD costs $206, and this turned into $189.90 in my account. So that's a fee of 7.82% in total.

I don't think this is possible. Not unless they want to maintain two separate order books, and have "USD market 1" and "USD market 2", which would nullify the very reason that people use Mt. Gox: highest liquidity. Trading engines are inherently single threaded, because they need to maintain a single, unified order book. If the actual order book handling is split up in multiple threads, it would probably become slower because passing messages between threads is relatively slow (especially if they're on two separate servers).

We can call them whatever we want ("banks", "payment processors", "payment insurers", etc.). The point that makes it all possible is the low barrier to entry in the system. As a green address-provider, you literally only have to earn the trust of merchants. Anything besides that involves downloading a program from the Internet, and probably setting it up to work in an automated fashion. As long as it remains this way, prices will be pushed to the bottom, because anyone - as long as they can gain the trust of sellers who need to make sure they get paid - can enter the market.

This isn't true. It will never be safe to accept 0-confirmation transactions in Bitcoin. You can increase security by using partial confirmations, like Casascius has discussed, but it doesn't make it safe.
What instant confirmations do is they add feedback, not security. So instead of knowing nothing about whether miners are working on your transaction until it has 1 confirmation, you know very quickly if it has been picked up by the miners. But the fact that miners are working on your transaction is not a guarantee that it will be included in a block.

Yes. It seems they deployed an upgrade to their trading engine around Apr 14, which increased the maximum TPS they can handle.
It doesn't necessarily mean there are more people trading now than there were before, just that they can execute about twice as many trades per second now, so it takes twice the transaction volume to max out their trading engine (and cause a lag).

There is no substitute for randomness.
Again, you might succeed; no one knows if an attacker will think of trying decimals from pi. But even if you choose from the first one million decimals in pi, and your passcode can be 10-30 characters in length, that is only 21 million different combinations. It would take a computer a few seconds - at most - to try this out.
21 million combinations is less than 25 bits of entropy. You would be **a lot** better off trying to memorize six words from a 7000-word dictionary. The following passphrase (six random words form a 7132-word dictionary):
    owe hanged oath gleam royal emotion

Bitcoin isn't different from VISA in the sense that you can get a discount on a large amount of transactions.
Amazon gets a discount on the standard 3% VISA rate, because they can guarantee *a lot* of transactions.
They could make the same exact deal with one or more miners, who will guarantee to include Amazon transactions for a certain fee. This is why the new Payment Protocol is nice: it allows the *receiver* to pay the fee instead of the sender.
I often send bitcoin transactions with a 0.0001 BTC fee, and they confirm immediately. So that alone is a $7 minimum for a 1% fee. But I'm fairly sure Amazon could get a better deal than 7 cents per bitcoin transaction.

I ran bitcoind on my RPi for a while. It doesn't work any more, as it keeps running out of memory. The 512 MB of RAM in the Pi seems to be inadequate at the moment. This might be solved in the future by optimizing bitcoind. For example, the devs have added a "no wallet" feature, that makes it use less RAM. And in the future we will probably see a way to limit the RAM use of bitcoind, instead of just letting it use whatever it wants, and getting killed when it uses too much.

Fair points. I don't know why you're getting downvoted.
I'd say the initial reaction in the culmination of a debt crisis is a drop in the gold price.

Two pieces of advice:
1. Use Armory and an [offline wallet](
Buy an old laptop that has a detachable Wifi card. Install Armory on it and pull out the Wifi card. Now run Armory and generate your offline wallet and encrypt it with a strong passphrase (so your funds are protected in case the laptop is stolen). Make a paper backup of the wallet, and put it in a separate location (safe deposit box, girl/boyfriend's apartment) to protect against the laptop dying or getting stolen. Export a watch-only wallet via a USB stick to an online computer on which Armory is installed as well. Now you can view the balance of your offline wallet using the online computer without being able to transfer money unless you sign the transaction on the offline computer.
2. Get your money off the exchange as fast as you can. Especially if it's Mt. Gox.

That's the point - you can't confirm the transaction on the offline computer without having the relevant inputs that it redeems. And sometimes supplying all the inputs to a transaction will make it too big to fit into even dozens of QR codes, making this approach non-optimal.
But it's important to point out that this attack is *very* unlikely to take place, certainly less likely than getting your coins stolen from an online computer, which still makes it worth while. I mean, throwing out added security just because it isn't perfect really doesn't make sense.
The most important reason this attack will remain unlikely is that attackers can't profit from this directly, ie. send the coins to themselves. They can only trick you into signing a transaction whereby you lose your coins as a transaction fee, and the probability of the attacker picking this up by mining simultaneously is fairly low.

It shouldn't be too difficult to adjust to the fact that difficulty increases happen every 2016 blocks and not every 14 days. It simply means that, if we use 20% as an example, there will be 365/(14 days * 0.80) difficulty adjustments per year, instead of 365/14.
So the math would be:
    365 / (14 * (1 - diff_adj))
difficulty adjustments per year.
For example with 15% per adjustment:
    365 / (14 * (1 - 0.15)) = 30.67
So you would replace the relevant line in `slider/main.js` with:
    $decline = Math.pow(1 - (value/2), 365 / (14 * (1 - (value/2))));
For reference, I keep a text log of all past difficulty adjustments that updates automatically every time a difficulty adjustment occurs:

Two things:
1. It contains no transactions
2. Its stimestamp is before that of the previous block
The block not including any transactions could be because it was found very quickly after the previous block (so that the node hadn't picked up any transactions that weren't in the previous block), or because the miner in question runs a custom node that doesn't include transactions in blocks (many botnet miners do this).
The incorrect timestamp is caused by the computer running the miner not having its clock set correctly. As long as the clock isn't too far off, it's not a problem and the block will be accepted by the network.

Only if they are 100% sure of getting the 25 BTC reward if they follow the longest chain, which they aren't.
The probability of them finding the next block in the longest chain is 30%, so their average reward for this is 25 BTC \* 0.3 = 7.5 BTC.
So finding two blocks in a row at a probability of 9.5% is profitable if the reward from doing so is greater than 7.5/0.095 = ~79 BTC, as far as I can see.
This would mean that the added fees would need to be 79-25\*2 = 29 BTC for it to be profitable.
Anything I'm missing here?
If this is true then hashing power is irrelevant. Only the size of the fee determines whether it's profitable to try to orphan the block to get the extra fees.

Depends on whether you like a large risk/profit ratio (BTC) or a huge risk/profit ratio (ASIC miner).
Pesonally, I think the best bet (if these are the only two options) are bitcoins. The mining market just seems to chaotic. There's no way to predict what will happen.
An important point, as I see it, is that ASIC producers will have every incentive to lower costs on future devices. The vast majority of the costs associated with producing an ASIC, is designing it. When this is taken care of, and you have a working product, spitting out more chips is pretty cheap. With the number of ASIC producers in the market currently (assuming they aren't scams most of them) there will be a pressure to sell ASIC miners at a decreasing price to make the most of your investment. I think it's very possible that an ASIC miner bought today might never pay itself back (assuming you sell the coins right after you mine them).

It appears you have fallen for the [Gambler's fallacy](
No matter how many shared they've found, the chance of them finding a block within the next week, or day, or hour, will always be the same (determined by the difficulty).
@_date: 2013-10-09 22:38:12
Correct. And even if the difficulty continues to increase 30% every adjustment, you'll have a 0.152% chance of mining a 25 BTC block in the next year. Although you also win a lot less than if you win the state lottery. But of course, one should also factor in electricity costs. An RPi and a USB Eruptor shouldn't draw more than 6 watts, so that's $8 in power at $0.15/kWh plus $12 for the Erupter, which equals $20 for a 0.15% chance of winning 25 BTC within the next year - if the difficulty rises 30% per adjustment from now on and a year forward.
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:50:53

You should start an anti-DDoS company. I bet they haven't though of this.
No, seriously, a DDoS works by maxing out the available bandwidth of a given server. If Bitstamp is on a 1 gbit link, then all you have to do is send 1 gbit of data to their IP, continually, to saturate their connection. This makes it impossible for others to access the site. It doesn't matter what Bitstamp's response is to this traffic, their line is saturated, there isn't room for more connections.
The only way to solve is to not route the malicious traffic to Bitstamp in the first place, which is what CloudFlare, Incapsula, etc. do. But what do you do if the attacks keep coming from new IPs?

Please understand the difference between a [spot market]( and a [futures market]( Two different goods are traded on these markets.
In a spot market, the goods purchased must be available for delivery within a few days. This is not the case on Mt. Gox, as withdrawals take months. Mt. Gox is currently a USD futures market. You can purchase a futures contract that expires in a month or two in USD, for bitcoins. Exchanges that allow delivery within a few days are spot markets.
Prices in the futures market are usually higher than in the spot market, which is what we see with Mt. Gox versus the other Western exchanges.

Gold can be used by modern humans to fill cavities in teeth, and as a catalyst, but by primitive humans it was useless. Thus, its value is clearly not intrinsic to the metal itself, its value comes from its use, hence why I think we should call it "use value" and not "intrinsic value".

So you prefer huge, too-big-to-fail banks that require bail-outs from the government because they grow so big that they'll take down the entire economy down with them if they fail?
Granted, people lose their money if they have them in a bank that defaults. But the great thing about small, short-lived banks is that no one trusts them with that much money (or at least they shouldn't). You have a continual process of cleaning out the bad banks from the banking sector, so investors experience small losses frequently. Compare this to our current system, where instead investors will face huge losses *in*frequently - which is much harder for an economy to accommodate.
Bankruptcy is exactly what makes capitalism work. It removes dysfunctional corporations from the economy. Preventing companies, in this case banks, from defaulting only leads to abnormally large, poorly run companies, because they face no or few consequences from operating at a loss or with high risks.

Proof-of-work systems haven't really been employed in an attempt to stop spam. The purpose of stamps is not to prevent junk mail, it's to pay the delivery service.
That being said, proof-of-work can't stop spam altogether. If I pay 1 cent per email I send, it just means that all spam emails that generate, on average, less than 1 cent per email will disappear. But if someone can figure out a way to make spam more profitable, we will still see spam with a 1 cent price of an email.

My point is that individual transactions are combined with each other, to produce new transactions. Thus, what you view as a bundle of 11 BTC ceased to exist when it was combined with another transaction, and this bundle (which exists of some percentage of the 11 BTC and some percentage of the BTCs from the other transaction) is then split into two new transactions. You can't single out the original 11 BTC since they have been combined with other coins.
As I mentioned, it's like me transferring $100 to your bank account which already holds $100. Then, subsequently, you transfer $100 to Alice and $100 to Bob. We can't deduce whether Alice or Bob got those original $100 you received from me, just by looking at whom you've transferred money to. Indeed, it doesn't even make sense to try to distringuish the "$100 you received from me" from the "$100 that were already in your bank account". They've been fused and are indistinguishable from each other.


Just by looking at the block chain, you cannot meaningfully say where those "11.02 BTC" were transferred to. You can say that *X* BTC were transferred to address A, and that these *X* BTC consists of, for example 10% of the original 11.02 BTC, and 90% coins from another transaction. But that's not really helpful, and confuses more than it helps, I think.


The auditability of the blockchain makes it possible to see the number of coins "held" by an address; that's all. This is what Bitcoin is - a decentralized ledger showing the balance of addresses. It does not allow distinguishing the origin of the funds held at an address. Indeed, this is what makes it money - the fact that each unit is indistinguishable from the next.

Well said.
A good passphrase is defined by how much *randomness* it contains. You need to throw a dice or have a computer generate a passphrase using a random number generator to get a good password.
A good command on Linux is the following:
    shuf --random-source=/dev/random -n6 /usr/share/dict/words
it picks out six random words from the word list in `/usr/share/dict/words` and prints them out. Example:
    leased
    accentuate
    solution's
    unscrewed
    redeployment's
    petitions
The word list in question contains 99,171 different words, so a combination of six words yields 99171^6 total combinations, or 2^99.58 which means it has about 100 bits of entropy.
If every person on earth had a billion computers that could do a billion calculations per second, it would take, on average, 4300 years to crack that password.
I use a 6-word combination from that word list as the encryption password for my Armory savings wallet. And the great thing is that I can tell everyone *how* I generated the passphrase (picked six random words from that dictionary using `/dev/random` as the source of randomness), and they still can't crack it.
Additionally, Armory uses `scrypt` to derive the actual encryption key from the password. A Radeon HD 6970	can do 512,000 scrypt iterations per second while consuming 245 watts. To crack a password with 100 bit entropy, you'd require 1.684973942×10²⁰ KWh of electricity. In 2008 the global energy production was 1.43851×10¹⁴ KWh. So cracking the password using the best technology available currently would require consuming over 1,000,000 times the energy produced in one year globally.
**TL;DR:** If your password wasn't chosen using randomness (eg. by throwing a dice) it's not strong.

Why not use the term "use value" instead? It avoids the confusion and reflects exactly what you point out; that it can be used for something even if someone else isn't willing to accept it in trade.
That something is intrinsic to something, means that you cannot separate the two. But clearly, millions of years ago, when humans hadn't discovered gold and we were just monkeys, no one valued gold. So value isn't intrinsic to gold.

Please note that in no way is it required for anyone to be devoted to doing a task they perform. I think we all agree that speculators are in it for the monetary gain, and - for me at least - that's fine. That being said, they *do* still help in price discovery, and they enable people who want to purchase bitcoins the liquidity needed to support them.
Examples of such activity are bountiful in capitalist societies. The companies that produced the parts that comprise the computer I'm typing this response on didn't do it to grace me with a fast computer; they might very well have done it for the profit. At the same time though, they *have* made me able to buy a powerful and cheap computer. The fact that their motivation is not altruistic does not discount the fact that it benefits me, and everyone else who wants a computer. Just like the fact that speculators being in it for the monetary gain doesn't discount the fact that they give bitcoin buyers a way to purchase bitcoins.

This is where Keynesians and Austrians disagree. I think money is absolutely supposed to be hoardable. If you work hard on something and get paid for it, of course you want to save a portion of that to be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor at a later time. That's the point of hoarding. Hoarding is the whole point of money; work while you are able to, and hoard money, and when you are unable to work (because of old age) you start dishoarding, ie. enjoying the fruits of your labor.

That's exactly how it works. You can specify the number of dice faces using the `--faces` option.


I'm using python-libbitcoin, which in turn uses OpenSSL. Reviewing the code of that library I can see it doesn't check the return values when generating the private key. I should make a commit that fixes this, so it throws an error if the private key isn't usable.
But if the key generation fails, it wouldn't show a valid address, an exception would most likely occur (because it wouldn't be able to calculate a public key and the address thus couldn't be calculated).

Exactly. I say give it 5 years and I'm willing to bet 1 BTC that no single entity will control more than 10% of the global hashrate.
First we had ASICMiner, which was the first/second Bitcoin ASIC in existence (along with Avalon). They could easily have had more than 50%, but chose to cap their hashrate to avoid paranoia. Now we have Ghash.io, who use chips from Bitfury, and I bet they're trying all they can to get as many chips as they can. And they now have around 30%.
So in one generation of ASICs (Block Erupters to Bitfury) we've halved the share a single entity can gain (I'm sure ASICMiner could have had 60% if they wanted).
Give it a few more generations, and I feel confident that we won't see a single entity with more than 10% of the global hashrate.
That doesn't include pools, because they are different from Ghash.io in the sense that they don't control their own hashrate. If they try anything funny, miners can withdraw their hashing power. This is not the case with ASICMiner and Ghash.io.

Why would there be a massive demand for more crypto currencies if the price of bitcoins rise?
Money is peculiar because of the fact that it can never become too expensive unless it's not sufficiently divisible. And this isn't a problem with Bitcoin.
If the demand for bitcoins rise, the price of bitcoins rises, and that - in itself - fulfills the demand, because your bitcoins now have more purchasing power. What you're really after when you hold money is immediate purchasing power, not the money itself. So if everyone wants more money (purchasing power), then the price will rise, and their need will be satisfied without needing to acquire more currency units.
@_date: 2013-08-21 19:42:53
Fair point. But the way the difficulty is increasing now, I don't think they will hold 10% for long. The average for the past 7 days is only 38 TH/s ([source]( That's only 8% already, and I expect that to drop.
The next difficulty adjustment will likely be around 25%, and it'll happen in three days:

Come on dude. They have already announced they're developing 2nd generation chips. Even if they hadn't it should be obvious that they know the life cycle of their old chips are getting shorter every day. No half-way intelligent competitor would assume they aren't developing new chips.

OP is not building a distributed exchange, as far as I can see.
With regards to your question about a distributed exchange, the solution to the problem is to have trusted actors within the distributed exchange. The order book should be maintained in a distributed manner, but the trades should be executed by trusted actors on the exchange. One such actor could be Mt. Gox. The difference is that they would only provide the service of moving fiat around, they wouldn't maintain an order book.
The distributed order book is possible with the Ripple system. I've explained how I think it works in this post:


So if Mt. Gox trusts Bitstamp, for example, a Bitstamp user with 100 USD in his account - which we will call bitstampUSD - wants to buy 1 BTC at 100 USD each. If Mt. Gox trusts Bitfloor, they can exchange dollars between themselves, thus enabling users to trade across exchanges.

Credit will appear where credit is needed. And fractional reserve banking is just credit. The amount of money doesn't matter, if you create more of it you just dilute the existing stock.
There is no reason fractional reserve banking can't exist with bitcoin. In fact, I expect it to emerge at some point when prices start stabilizing and people are looking for a greater return than just holding bitcoins.
There is nothing wrong with fractional reserve banking as long as you realize it constitutes you lending money to a bank in exchange for a return. This is lent out, by the bank, to people in need of it, and you get some of the return on that lending activity.
If money is scarce, its value will rise (prices denominated in that money will fall) and it will self-fulfill the demand for more money. Money is the only good that does this since it's only useful for it's ability to be exchanged to goods and services.
During the functioning parts of the gold standard, [real bills]( were used to provide credit to producers of goods in immediate demand. This is just an example of credit appearing where it is needed. If we can divide money sufficiently it can never get too scarce.

They're not guaranteeing you profitability. They can't. All they are guaranteeing is that you'll receive an additonal 4 times the hashing power you purchased. If the difficulty continues to grow like it has recently, this is barely enough to turn a profit.

Because the salt, by definition, is known. It's not a secret.
So bruteforcing to find *password* when *hash* is given:
    md5(password) == hash
is the same as bruteforcing to find *password* when *hash* and *salt* are given:
    md5(password+salt) == hash
It takes the same number of tries, on average.
It's only when you have a large database of passwords, all hashed with a different salt, that an attacker is slowed down: he will have to brute force each individual password instead off all of them at once.

Energy is probably the most important aspect here. Breaking a 128 bit key by brute force would use many many times the energy that the world uses in an entire year. So yes, it may be *possible*, but why would anyone use trillions of dollars to get your (with all due respect) small amount of bitcoins?


That is quite possible. 56 bit key sizes were once considered secure. Now they can be broken fairly quickly. But bear in mind that a 128 bit key is 2^128-56 times stronger than a 56 bit key. So even if we assume a doubling in computer performance per year (which, unless someone invents a quantum computer, is an over-estimation) it will take around 70 years before breaking a 128 bit key is easy to do.
But the important thing is always to focus on profitability. It's not important whether it's possible, but whether it's profitable. Spending a billion dollars on stealing a thousand dollars doesn't make sense.

I mean it's also possible that $400,000 would only be able to buy a loaf of bread at some point, thus making bitcoin reaching $400,000/BTC not very attractive. In other words, a rising USD price for bitcoins could also just mean a falling value of the USD.

There is a distinction between speculation - ie. the intent of increasing your wealth - and not intending on increasing your wealth.
If you exchange USD for EUR to go on vacation, and get back home and the EUR happened to have risen against the dollar, it's not a taxable event when you exchange your remaining Euros back into dollars. If, however, you're a currency trader, and you buy Euros because you think they'll go up in value (relative to the USD), then it is taxable, yes.

How so? You would still have to generate at least *49!* different combinations before you can check if they are a valid base58 private key.
**EDIT:** I think I get it now. You don't actually have to make *49!* combinations, because the last four bytes are actually derived from the first 33 bytes of the payload (1 version byte, 32 byte number, 4 byte hash). So you can reduce it by only shuffling 49 possible characters into 44 possible locations, and then reconstructing a part of the original payload, and append the last 5-6 characters from the hash of the payload to the end.

Exactly. The natural response to, for example, a threat of Mt. Gox' USD accounts being seized would be an *increase* in the USD price on Mt. Gox. People would hurry and sell their USD for bitcoins on Mt. Gox so they don't risk that their USD at Mt. Gox be seized.
We might even see a price of "infinite", meaning that no holders of bitcoin would be willing to sell their bitcoins for USD on Mt. Gox, and perhaps all other exchanges dealing in USD, out of fear of their USD accounts being seized as well.

Bear in mind that ASICMiner has't been hashing solo for more than 25 hours currently, so the uncertainty of the estimate is quite high (which is why it varies so much).

It's important to tell people that a private key is called that because it must remain private. There is no advantage in redeeming private keys, other that avoiding the minuscule fee of sending a transaction, while at the same time risking that your coins could disappear at any moment.

Definitely. ASICMiner has no incentive to *not* lower the price of the USB Erupter once demand at the current price has dried out. They did it from 1.99 BTC to 0.99 BTC, and they'll do it again once people aren't buying it for 0.99 BTC. I don't know what the manufacturing cost is, but I suspect a lot less than 0.99 BTC.
I have a hard time imagining any type of hardware that depreciates faster than mining hardware right now. Just look at the difficulty. We are hovering [over a 1% increase]( *per day*. That's around 4000% per year. That's how much your mining hardware decreases just based on how much it can earn. On top of that it decreases because sellers undercut each other.
So if mining hardware were a stock, both its price would fall (as a result of mining hardware getting cheaper) *and* its dividend would fall (around 4000% per year), because the difficulty is rising.
The only people making a lot of money now are producers of mining hardware.

Check your sources. That article cites a single source from a company called Bitcoin Co. Ltd.
They say they received a response from the Bank of Thailand, which claims that receiving bitcoins from foreigners is illegal.
No one has been able to back up this claim[\[1\]]( let alone verify that the Bank of Thailand even has the authority to criminalize the sending and receiving of bitcoins.
Central banks generally don't make any rules; they are created to manage a country's national currency.
So until the Thai government (not its central bank) actually confirms this, there is no reason to assume that Bitcoin is illegal in Thailand.

I think it comes down to terminology. Is taking dollars out of circulation the same as "destroying" them? We have the same discussion with bitcoins, where some argue that sending bitcoins to an unspendable address is destroying them, while others argue that they still exist, but are just taken out of circulation. I think both points of view are valid.
I also think the mere fact that the dollar - being irredeemable - is considered a liability for the Fed is absurd. When dollars were redeemable for something, this made sense. Dollars were destroyed when they were redeemed for gold back in the day. Today it is no longer a liability, and can't be destroyed in the same way they could before.

Mining relies on executing a hash function called SHA256 really quickly. Acoording to what I've read, quantum computers don't speed up hash functions.
A hash function is, unlike digital signature functions, simply bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, ROT etc.. There is no equation to solve, like with digital signature schemes, so the only way to speed it up is using a really fast chip that can do these bitwise functions.
TL;DR: Quantum computers are for solving equations that are hard to solve using traditional computers, not for doing bitwise operations (the latter being what hash functions constitute).

I definitely wouldn't advise anyone to store all of their wealth in precious metals, not even half of it. But I think it makes sense to store a part of your *long term* savings, say 10-15%, in gold. I think it makes sense for a portfolio to consist primarily of wealth-producing assets, like company stocks and bonds. But I don't see anything wrong with keeping a portion of it as "safe" (relative to stocks and bonds) capital.

I would maintain that the money laundering does not create victims, in and of itself. The theft creates a victim. Now, as I understand it, you claim that money laundering can redeem the victim of the theft, and make him a non-victim, thus money laundering is not victimless. I don't think that line of reasoning is valid.
Using that logic, it is not a victimless crime to *not* report something to the police. Because if you reporting, a theft for example, to the police means that the victim of the theft can get his money back, you're creating a victim by *not* reporting it to the police. I don't agree that this is the case. The victim is created by the thief. Not by you not reporting it to the police.
That being said, I don't think it should be legal to knowingly aid thieves in laundering money. If that is what you're doing, you're not innocent because you are part of the crime. You are knowingly helping the thief get away with his crime, and thus you are a part of the crime that creates a victim.
But just laundering money, for example by creating a Bitcoin mixer, is not a crime in and of itself, if you ask me.

I guess it's a matter of semantics then. I would like to separate these two concepts:
1. The *ability* (but not the *power*) to change someone's life (eg. by having money). You have the option to change someone's life, but the potential recipient is not *forced* to do something so he can get your money. The recipient can receive what he desires if he wishes to comply with your demands, if he is not interested he can walk away, but not without facing the consequences of his choice, course (we can never avoid facing the consequences of our choices).
2. The *power* to change someone's life, ie. by forcing them to do something. This is separate from the concept above because of the implication of force, you *cannot* walk away from someone who has true power over you. You cannot choose whether you would like to face the consequences of not complying because you do not have that option.
I call the latter "power" but not the former. I guess we differ in that respect.

Great! That is really the appropriate response. I wouldn't accept this treatment either.

I'm pretty sure that there are, although I'm no expert on the subject. The point is that we are free to use other protocols, but almost everyone chooses not to, because they benefit the most from just using TCP/IP. Thus, freedom to choose does not necessarily result in diversity.

It's really a pain to read this without being able to search through it, so I created this searchable PDF.
Uploading to Google Drive will make the PDF searchable, but it's limited to 10 pages, so I had to split it in four, upload each piece, download them again, merge them, and this is the result.
Would also be helpful to have a text-only/ASCII version (no PDF), but just copy/pasting messes up the formatting.
**EDIT:** You can download the file from the Google Drive Viewer using the "Download" option in the File menu. If anyone has a better place to host it, please do, and post the link here.

Why would it matter? Collisions, on average, every 2^n/2 tries for an n-bit hash function is not a problem, it's expected; it's a given. It cannot be otherwise. What problem would it pose?
Not to mention the practical impossibiliy of it. Storing 2^128 256 bit hashes would require 4.253529587×10²⁵ terabytes of storage. And simply running those 2^128 numbers up against each other would probably take longer than our universe has existed.

I think a better term for that is "use value". And I would claim that Bitcoin has use value even if it didn't have a dollar price. We basically have a piece of information that is in limited supply. This does not exist anywhere else.

They don't trust their coins with Blockchain.info. Only the user has the private keys when it comes to Blockchain.info. That doesn't mean they can't get tricked into sending their coins somewhere else, of course. Just like with all wallets.
As far as I understand, when you log in you are sent an encrypted wallet file that is client-side decrypted in javascript using your password.

Don't do it. Difficulty will be so high that when you finally receive your hardware - if you even receive it - the 30 GH/s will be equivalent to 300 MH/s.

Because miners are completely free to choose which transactions (if any) to include in a block.

Oh, wow. That's really nice. I remember their FPGA miners only having a 1 or 3-month warranty, so this is really nice to see. I stand corrected.

And even that's bullshit. If gold drops significantly in value, no one will wear gold jewelry. They wear it *because* it's expensive, that's the point of jewelry.
150 years ago, aluminum was more valuable than gold, because no one had figured out a way to extract it from the ore. Back then it was more expensive than gold, and all the rich people had a set of aluminum utensils, which were used for special guests, and the gold utensils were saved for the not-so-wealthy guests:

How was it the biggest financial catastrophe if nothing happened?
My opinion is that we have solved nothing. The environment for another crisis is even worse than it was before the 2008 crisis. The only thing keeping the market satisfied is extremely low interest rates, which do nothing but to cover up the dysfunctional nature of out monetary system, and incentivizes even greater leverage of our financial system, in order to make a decent return.
We have the exact same circumstances that we had before the 2008 crisis: increased leverage, in order to compensate for lowered interest rates. The market thought that this wasn't a problem, that it was experiencing higher returns with equal risks. [Raghuram Rajan]( with his 2005 paper, claimed that this wasn't true; that the market was getting higher returns with *higher risks*. Three years later it all crumbled.
The situation is the same today.

Exactly! ASICMiner will only sell hardware as long as they think they can earn more from this than mining with it themselves. Anything else would be disrespectful to shareholders.

Exactly. Which is what the low barrier to entry allows. But keep in mind that a store will have to trust whomever offers the green address-service.

I agree that it's not a black-and-white thing, that it could be both, but I think it qualifies as a debt instrument. You are buying an asset from someone that the counter party promises is redeemable in bitcoins on demand. That is the definition of a debt instrument.
I would argue the "physical bitcoin" is a bitcoin [Promissory note]( It fits the definition perfectly: 


The difference between a traditional promissory note and a "physical bitcoin" is that you can check the balance of the "physical bitcoin" at any time, and thus determine whether the note is actually backed by what it promises (bitcoins). This is not possible for, for example, a gold-redeemable promissory note.

When do you expect the footage to be ready? I'm quite curious about the results. Whether it's the chips drawing all the power or other components on the board. BFL has said they're making new boards that will increase the efficiency. So if the components aren't drawing much power that explanation would seem kind of bogus (as far as I know, components on the board causing the actual chips to use too much power isn't possible, but I am by no means knowledgeable on the subject).

Firstly, *IJustPutARandomPasswordInMyPasswordRightThere* is not random. The only randomness your password contains is:
1. the four random characters
2. the position of the four random characters
four random characters that are uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols have, around, 26+26+10+10=72 combinations. So that's 72^4 = 26873856 ~= 27 million combinations.
The random position is a from 1 to 46 (the length of "IJustPutARandomPasswordInMyPasswordRightThere"). So that's 46*27 million = ~1.2 billion combinations. This can be bruteforced in a fairly short time, probably less than a year.

Correct. And please don't say that SHA256 being vulnerable will make people flock to Litecoin: Litecoin depends on SHA256 for transaction hashes (and, thus, the Merkle tree as well).

I would say you are mistaken. Banks in general aren't the problem, it's our current monetary system that is at fault. Banks shouldn't be able to create money, which Bitcoin fixes. Banks just pay you interest on your money and invest them for you, nothing wrong with that.

No, it doesn't *just* favor early adopters and encourage hoarding (the keyword being "just"). It does this too, but it also favors later adopters, by not devaluing their savings as times goes on. All savers benefit from this, whether early or late.
