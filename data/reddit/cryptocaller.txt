What’s evil is having the anxiety inducing BTC price ticker strapped on your wrist to stare at all day.

What do these words even mean? I’m actually amazed that you even figured out how to buy anything given that this is how you talk.

Bro. What the hell are you talking about? What does “initiate switching it over” mean? The price won’t be locked in at whatever it is when you move it off of the exchange and into your own hardware wallet. That’s not how things work at all. You need to educate yourself further or quickly sell your bitcoin and move on, because you are clueless about how all of this works.

Buying some on each dip is very smart. I would be wary of choosing to sell some on each big green spike. You’re creating a taxable event every time that you do that. The IRS may be slow to react currently, but eventually they will be looking to collect on all of those taxable events that investors are creating if they do something like this.

You get that you’re talking about five different decentralized wallets that you personally secure, versus, five *centralized* bank accounts that you personally do not secure, right? Apples to oranges comparison. What exactly is your point?

It’s not much more difficult and it’s exponentially more secure. What don’t you get? Spread you assets out versus having all of your eggs in one basket. It’s a no brainer.

It probably won’t seem over the top in 10-20 years if these crypto appreciate the way that many expect that they will.  But sure, be dramatic.

Yes, do it.

The US dollar is inflationary, whereas Bitcoin is deflationary . The US dollar can be produced indefinitely, compared to Bitcoin which is finite and capped at a maximum supply of 21 million.
