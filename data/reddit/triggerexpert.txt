Thanks. This looks like a decent solution. I will see if I can update my software, prune the blockchain and let it sync.

Hey, imagine being me and sitting on a big pile of money that you have no idea how to touch without making it unsafe and opening it up to hackers or accidentally losing a file and losing all the money forever.
It drives you insane.

You think I'm doing this as a hobby? My pile of coins increased in value by tenfold.
This is not a hobby, this is a nest egg.

Yeah, assuming you have 90 gigabyte of harddisk space you're willing to fill. In my own case, I'm stuck with TWO connections to the network, neither of which seems willing to download any blocks. Instead, I'm given a message that I'm using "outdated and network-inconsistent software". What do I even do now?


It's not that I'm too dumb to do it, it's that it's manual work that can go wrong, in which case I would lose my coins.

I bought these Bitcoin in early 2013 and used Bitcoin-QT because everyone said it's safest and "helps the network". You think I had any clue at the time how big the blockchain would get?
The pile of coins just became worth more and more and with every increase in price I became more frightened of touching them.

No, not true, Bitcoin is a Tulip mania Ron Paul fake money monopoly coin for right-wing populist post-truth conspiracy theorists. It has already died dozens of times as every intellectual who reads non-fake news like the Washington Post and the New York Times knows.

Sounds like another post-truth politics fake news right-wing populist conspiracy theory to me. The Euro is stronger than ever before, the whole world wants to buy Euro's after we showed the world how humane and enlightened we are by providing shelter to hundreds of thousands of refugees who are eager to participate in our society. Bitcoin could never work, why would anyone want to buy Bitcoin if he can buy the Euro?
