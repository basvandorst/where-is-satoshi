I tried it out, the machine is way faster than the previous one. I also like the part where I DON'T need to verify my telephone number.

When I went to your BTM near Chinook, there was very limited parking and when I finally made it inside, it wasn't working. The staff there didn't seem to know who to call or really care. I don't think I'll be going back.

I went to see their machine in WED and it is a pretty impressive looking machine. I didn't use it because I am afraid to submit my personal data to buy BTC. The machine worked; although, it was awfully slow. In my opinion, I wouldn't use it because it's way too invasive. Banks don't scan your veins or take pictures of your ID to withdraw / deposit notes and etc...

Exactly, if you don't want to send in ID and wait for funds to transfer, then you pay a fee for the convenience of having it now.

I agree. I was very excited and eager to tryout their machine near Chinook Mall; however, I wasted twenty minutes to park and then I found out their machine was offline. I asked the Waves Coffee staff if they could help me or call someone and they didn't know or care. The store was also dead quiet, so picking up the phone to call Buttnational must have been to much work for them.
I personally will continue to use yycbitcoinatm and BitcoinBrain's service. They have always been true to their word and kind to their customers.
