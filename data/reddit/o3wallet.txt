If the solution was that easy they could have already fixed it. I can go whole day trying to explain but its too long discussion to have it on reddit. Perhaps simply do a google search on "Bitcoin Block Size debate" 
BTW which wallet client you have used to send this transaction?

lol!! this is good one.  didn't mentioned if it was bitcoin transaction. May be they are also struggling with blocksize debate since inception of ACH.

Transactions are slower because blocks are full and if your transaction doesn't meet high priority requirements. Developers are working hard to fix this problem, But it'll take time. So meanwhile use wallet with Dynamic fees - (Fees will be calculated based on the size and priority of the transaction).

There are few solutions but they have their pros and cons. Increasing block size from 1 to 2 MB, segregated witness, Lightning network and many more (google). And this issue is currently of top priority. But since bitcoin is open-source and not under central controls, every decision need consensuses and allot of R&amp;D and the fact that network carries allot of financing value makes it even difficult to make decision. Core dev's have released version 0.12.1 - Moving toward scalability. There is no easy or quick fix. For now only solution is to use wallets with Dynamic fees. Our wallet supports dynamic fees but its still in testing phase, You can check how it work - use testnet and testnet coins. @

Bitcoin Core support Opt-In Replace-By-Fee (Opt-in RBF) which allows transactions to be flagged as replaceable and replaced until the transaction gets confirmed in the next block. I don't think any other wallet provider support this feature yet.
I don't think Electrum support dynamic fees. In the future use something like  to get approximate fees.
and if you are a developer, you can use their api's to automatically calculate fees for every transaction
