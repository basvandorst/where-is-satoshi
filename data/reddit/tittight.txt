Correct me if I am wrong but just because you pay tax on each transaction that doesn't mean you will be taxed twice. You are only being taxed on your p/l. Example.
Buy btc for 100. 
Goes up and you buy 110 worth of ethereum. 
Eth goes up 100% and you sell it all for 220. 
You then cash your btc out and it didn't change price so you have 220 in cash. 
You pay tax on 120. 
Whatever bracket you are in for short term ect. Say 25%
So how are they figuring 70%
Unless the might be including fees during transactions? 
Total shitpost

Whew yea it is hard not to go full bore sometimes, and the markets always so crazy. losses suck but school is expensive so it all works out!! Just calculate your actions and the actions you thought about taking but never did. 
edit: also thank you, but i think anybody can get their "boat" as long as they hold. Even if it is some of those shitcoins. As long as fundamentals haven't changed and shit didn't just bitconnect, just hold forever!

The only thing that sucks about taxes this year is I had to enter over 400 transactions into turbo tax by hand. I think if you have the offline version you can import them but wasn't going to waste my time to run into problems there. 
Since I traded my ass out on the way down in aug-sept my taxes weren't too terrible, so it goes both ways, and I got a free motha fuckin boat! 
Hell yea. Not like anyone cares but my current strategy is to only pull profits and trade shit I know will be ok long term. after a while you don't have any skin in the game and things become awesome. 
Best way to handle emotions I have found.
tl;dr do what it takes to pay and the irs will gladly be ok with all of this. Everyone has the potential to be benefiting hugely so pay the man so he doesn't come after you. And also because worrying about this will kill your ability to think when you are trading or whatever. get rid of scarcity = happy trades

They are talking about derivatives like etns and cfds that should be illegal no mater what financial institute they are representing. But you can't manipulate crypto etns like you can housing market etns so.   
No one should ever put their money in bullshit derivatives like that anyways. Unless you are the bankers doing it and it is making you 100s of millions every week. Then fuck the peasants with these fancy financial instruments.

Now here is something I have zero thought about. 
Any idea if it has been discussed?

I disagree. I taught my bro to use the ledger. He is becoming a crypto veteran now. It took some time, but if there is a will there is a way.

Whether people admit it or not you are correct and doge superior in many ways and it has an amazing community. Not to mention it has/is a good store of funds when things on the  btc side get rocky. Even when it is 20 satoshis it still holds good value with bitcoin. 
Dogecoin is here to stay.

You said it correctly. Very nicely put I might add. It's when you sit and think about it my head hurt. take out the cannot and see that isn't what you meant.

I'll take my chances. What's the worst that will happen? Oh man. Guess I gotta keep working. Like every other schmuck.

No doubt. Everyone should have their 401 or Roth, but damn if I ain't playing crypto and options till I'm 40 at the very least. Could get lucky and get to stop within the next few years. Never know
@_date: 2016-11-19 17:28:06
Haha oh, Well I did not know that but it makes perfect sense through the eyes of a government..

Yea!! I am waiting for them to audit me so I can get my tax deductions filed Lol. I bet they would end up owing a lot of people for capital losses.

You can almost watch this happen on the shorts chart. Wait for the price to rebound a bit and shorts will start coming in. Then the 2k BTC sell walls show up.   
That is the proof of manipulation that you asked for. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:40:24
Bitfinex. The "new" money helped push it to 20k but I wouldn't be surprised if there was some tether help to push it up. 
Market volatility (in other financial markets) has gone down significantly over the last decade and now we have Crypto which is a traders wet dream. Things will change but as of now a small 100million can do quite a bit of damage. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:37:05
Well if you had a gain because of that sale to dollars, you had to pay taxes on the gain? What am I missing? 
You can't be thinking someone who never traded but only sold back to dollars didn't have to pay taxes. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:39:14
Damn. You had me worried for a minute. And I was like Noooooooo. I read it a million times, noooooooooooo. I just had my taxes processed finally this week and thought the taste of freedom could have been too good to be true

Everyone knows you gasngo when the store is busy and you buy a snack and they don't ask if you had fuel to pay for. Then it is on them! 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:30:52
I can't say I don't agree. But if you dissect all of these other issues you will find that the teeth the banks had in the government and all guilty parties, you can basically bring the blame right around to the banks. 
For instance the Rating agencies. You tell me that they wouldn't have given a correct rating if they 'could have'? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:24:55
So you are looking at this from the wrong angle. 
Other ways to store wealth have way higher market caps. 
Gold is roughly 8 Trillion. 
Cash on the planet is well over 50T
Entire Crypto Market cap 135.7 Billion
Crypto Currencies wouldn't be nearly as volatile if the market cap was comparable to the other ways to store value you are thinking. 
Keep studying

Consumers aren't responsible for making sure a bank is solvent and investors who are led to believe their investments have quality products also are not responsible.
People were misled by the banks. Making the banks and lenders(the banks) responsible. 
So talk to me about ignorance. Because theres a whole lot of ignorant people out there that lost their house because of the negligence and greed of the banks and lenders(the banks). 
What is it you were trying to say?
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:25:49
Agreed. A coworker told me of a house in town for 280 and someone came in with 300 w/ no fees. Why would you spend that 300 cash up front when interest rates are still relatively low?
Only thing I could think of is to protect some profits after the great market we have seen. Since the housing market is exceptionally stable here.

Maybe you should watch "the big short" and let margot robbie and all her friends explain it in ways you'll understand.

I respect that. Success story in the making. Yea you could move.. but the bay area is awesome. And as long as you aren't down on yourself and find depression setting in I think what you are doing is awesome. 
I would have done the exact same of I didn't have a dog who would hate me if he didn't have some sort of roof over his head. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:41:23
Haha. Point taken. But at the same time when I called all the tax advisers in my area and asked them what I was looking for they couldn't help me. So honestly this is probably some of the better advice about this type of tax situation.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:27:57
Thanks for the clear answer. Am I taking on a huge amount of risk by waiting? 
My current situation is 2 years ago I sold everything for pretty much a solid loss due to my job being commission and work being extremely slow. 
Within the last year I have started buying again but haven't sold anything for cash. I have been trading and have about a 150% gain over my original basis. At the end of this year it won't be difficult to sort out my loss/gain and figure out who owes what. 
So from what you said, if I want, I can go back for any loss I received 2 years ago. Otherwise I can start keeping better track this year and pay the 2017 taxes that I will owe. And I can do this mostly worry free without it biting me in the future. 
We are only talking about a few thousand of capital. No moon has been reached from my computer

Time in the market &gt; timing the market. It has been tested over and over again and even when only investing during the peaks, a person still comes out ahead.

Sucks doesn't it? I still believe it is just the beginning though!!! Lessons learn. Holding now.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:57:26
If they couldn't handle it there would be a window where you'd be able to get in. Some people would get in. 
When they go down, it is timed in a way that makes me think there is a script set up to shut the site down if the price moves too far too fast.
