its confirmed now.
how do you RBF?
its on electrum
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:41:17
but the lower the fee the longer the transactions will take right?
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:37:28
cool, how many sats/bytes is generally good when sending ?

I've created a bench32 segwit wallet. When transferring fees in my standard wallet to segwit what kind of fee should I use?
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:10:40
I will try this but I'm not sure what you mean by putting a single line in it?
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:19:27
by external hard drive do you mean a usb?

I tried what you said to do but I cant create a file in  mempool.dat 
when I click on mempool.dat it just opens a blank text document. I dont think I can create a folder in a blank text document ?
I tried just typing bitcoin.conf in the text document and I saved it but Im not sure how to put prune in this?
also Im using electrum not bitcoin qt whatever that is
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:08:33
Using electrum
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:24:31
Can I still do this?
Also will I need to delete the block chain history to clear up space.?
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:45:28
when i go to the roaming files its the file called bitcoin which is taking up so much space. 81 GB
The file electrum doesnt take up too much space
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:14:22
Im sorry Im really slow and I know very little about computers.  where is bitcoin.conf do you know?
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:37:52
when I click on the bitcoin file in roaming  the following files come up
 Blocks
 Chainstate
 testnet3 
wallets lock
 banlist.dat
 debug
 feeestimates.dat 
 peers.dat
there is no bitcoin.conf file
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:21:42
so all I will have to do is copy the bitcoin file and then paste it on to a USB and then I can delete the bitcoin file and I still will be able to use my wallet (electrum)without any problems?
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:09:17
where do I enter this do you know?
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:05:35
I deleted the file and its cleared a lot of space.
thanks for your help. it must of been related bitcoin core file.
do you know any way I can check to see if I damaged my electrum wallet in any way?
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:23:10
ok so I call the text document bitcoin.conf
I then open up the text document and type in prune=1024 and I then save this document . 
what do I do next?
I tried reopening electrum but my disk is still full up.?
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:22:18
its windows so I guess yes,
I tried searching for bitcoin.conf in the windows(c drive) 
but nothing comes up
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:15:13
should I create a folder or text document called bitcoin.conf  ?
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:40:17
when I type bitcoincore into the file search nothing comes up.
anyway I know my electrum wallet seed and password. so can I just delete the whole bitcoin file and then redownload electrum?
I think maybe I downloaded bitcoin core months ago maybe but I never used it.
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:31:47
no im using electrum
