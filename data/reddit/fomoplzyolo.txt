i dont get that  - isnt it just supply / demand anymore? now peoples pays days play a role. really? wow
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:42:07
There is a difference between bitcoin blockchain and blockchain .... 
Would you invest in an old racing horse? tech evolves...
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:54:00
no whales pushing - financed by dumps on fomo 
business as usual! hodl like the top 1000 adresses
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:38:24
whats a fair price in your opinion - and why?
when will you transform that something into real money - whats your moon ?
google washtrading and pump dump + i can sell you a pencil for 1000000000USD but you might never find someone to buy it from you. Get out when time is right for you - but dont call others FUD cause your moontrip will never end.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:05:24
because bitcoin market is like this at the moment... imo
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:31:55
do your math based on this 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:29:43
you seriously look at exchanges with volume of 0.1%? 
 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:33:57
when its get hot - they backlogg and freeze - system is meant to go up not sideways or even down at this magnitude and stage - massiv fomo hysteria waves rolling in to support the system. 
Waiting for cash probably
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:45:11
just massiv pump and dump in progress @ GDAX 
specially when you look at bitfinex...
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:24:18
SRY MATE - WAKE UP
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:45:15
why is it not frozen then?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:41:22
what happens when you try to cash out? - legally? you still need the middle man &gt; exchange ... whats your point?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:11:27
40k on 18th - after that to the moon - forget the daily news all FUD - HODL .... ehm yes
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:07:35
trust me - wait a few hours - prices wont go up 


@_date: 2017-12-14 10:18:51
bottom line - bitcoin shot over the moon regarding it as a daily currency and for small transactions!
its an asset now!
if you want to stay in the blockchain - get low fee and transactions use ETH LCT whatever...
 yeah bitcoin is not working as intended :-)
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:39:27
everybody that fomos in now will burn themselves - my opinion
why do you want to convince someone?
yes its a pyramid 2.0 sort of - it needs more investors who keep pushing up - cause hodling alone wont help... 
respect their opinions and enjoy your ride
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:02:07
smart guy .-)
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:55:28
depends how much money you have - I suggest a cancel if its a withdrawal- new fee above 140sat/B - rest gets stuck in mempool!
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:37:27
good ride hodler - dont forget to make money as long as you can
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:21:17
I know... this is the intrinsic value of bitcoin!
possibility to pump dump / short distort and spoof... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:52:56
too many fomo rushing in - probably backloggin!
 i have a transaction pending on bitfinex since 4 days :-/
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:49:00
i hope you know that pump/dump and spoofing are illegal in regulated markets + uneven wealth distribution &gt; this is the reason for volatility here.
your analysis is utter ... :-) HODL but keep it real plz
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:28:48
sry mate
why should I need bitcoin when I can make my own digital currency with a blockchain, ripple-like or tangle style tech?
National Banks could do it if they would literally burn paper money for digital money 1:1 - dUSD without inflating.
Every Bank could easy do it - according Basel III - even as a credit...
UBSCOIN in CHF - Because Banks can "make" money regarding Basel III - all swiss banks could make a swisscoin CHF backed proper by all banks...
Why I need bitcoin and tether scams - it's blockchain, tangle, etc. what I need...
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:04:50
he aint U$D billionaire - stop the spam
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:26:00
1. wash trading and pump dump on new fomo?
2. make an equal society with fair wealth distribution?
you choose
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:54:14
common sense - its a financial institute for goods sake!
people have real money there!

@_date: 2017-12-17 01:57:07
who can? coinbase?  shitting me?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:10:55
yep - mempool grows - in case of drop it will struggle imo.
pay the fees required to get through - i guess
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:00:10
you tried to cash out of the system btc worth $4K to your real bank account from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:59:08

dont invest money u cant loose 
maybe google FOMO - sry to say
i dont intend to FUD - but noone hear knows a solution to your problem. There are a lot of Kraken post - maybe they help. Sry mate
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:10:10
 - is the difference more then - / + 0.5%?
wouldn't make sense in my opinion...? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:01:18
you know who operates tether and bitfinex? - right :-)
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:07:57
you know google?
ASCI + HASH + POWER
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:22:51
easy in - hard out.... make sure your exit way is free! you dont want to get stuck in a ID pending backlogg overload loop when shit hits the fan.
of course it will go to the moon first! so you have time to do this in 2018
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:22:11
if they reduce btc in circulation / if they washtrade / if they pump and dump on you
if they tell you it will go to the moon - and only thing you got is faith and you need to hodl and lure more people in


when shit hits the fan &gt; the exchanges will refer to their terms and to the mails they send to you to be careful &gt; legal backdoor for them
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:36:14
Bitcoin is NOT blockchain - blockchain is open source - they will use it like they want
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:34:58
I really hope you were joking! I hope you can handle the stress and dont HODL - set yourself a limit when you sell in case it drops and make sure you know how to get it out quick - what way works (depends on your country) you don't want your cash be stuck in an exchange when shit hits the fan - just my 2c
good luck
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:40:07
u know that gold is required to produce that thing you just typed that nonsense on? :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:20:46
i have this path....
entry coinbase &gt; bitfinex (trade all) &gt; coinbase exit
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:54:19
 - is this scam?!
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:55:19
is it a currency or a community project?
i totally get the whitepaper of blockchain, i get tangle - but i don't get what the vinkelwoss says: it's a currency, it's gold 2.0 - its a  network... 
facebook, ebay, linkedin.... point taken of course - blockchain too - but bitcoin? why do people matter - 1000 people pricing a banana at 1000$ doesnt make it a 1000$ to the rest - is it gold 2.0 - wtf is it?
jesus christ - I know why I have IOTA but i soon dump my last btc cause of this crap....
EDIT: it's not a stock! YOU DONT OWN BLOCKCHAIN when you have btc - wait till the fed launch there digital dollar....

next step - how to make money on the way down!
Hodl will kill you - making money on the way up (and down) is what you have to do :-) like whales
Hodl - is for fomo / and believers - NO FUD intended!
Tips: pump &amp; dump and spoof grouping!
 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:22:05
swiss?! hodl - no im almost out :-P cashing out is a pain in the ass - and watchin gdax with poporn is epic at the moment
wall 17000 / wall 17200 / 17250 .... the monster wasnt killed yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:56:21
ehmm that was maybe ok at the start 2018 - buy a beer - wait 8 hours in a bar to confirm an pay 200% surcharge?
bitcoin is dead for paying and small trading
its a asset or maybe an unregulated equity of a *ç%ç?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:34:39
and because transactions take hours you will never know if you made a bargain or got ripped off - plus 15+$ fee.... today!
2020 when Bitcoin is 1 BTC = 500'000.- $ / 1 sat = 0.005 $
One coffee will be... at least!:
(size min. 230bytes / fee min 100 sat/B - u need that today! :-)
230 x 100 x 0.005 = 116$ plus the coffee :-) if you want that coffee fast &gt; 1160$ plus the coffee...
greed and fomo kills the whitepaper :-(
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:42:47

Most people no shit about this systems - and yes its good that banks safe fomos! its a nice game but you need to know the rules
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:12:42
the 20$ is the fee for the transaction as we speak - i think you forgot that in your story
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:19:36
read that with your dad - it will help to understand:
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:21:14
point on :-P
and the FOMO will lern about pump dump spoof whales groups too late - so you enter for a moonride but u get ripped up right from start :-)
Mempool, fees, unconfirmed, cash out limits, etc. - its limited and a con NOW - it wasnt itended to be, but the whitepaper got hijacked :-)
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:57:33
 fud
the video is full on - but it's not a bubble - it's the "mistery" of the century - not blockchain - not the whitepaper - just all the cryptos are.... one day you will figure it out - trust me! digital currencies will come - based on real ones according to Basel III
the truth is in the chain! Check outgoing transactions of the top 1000.... faked scarcity and market manipulation
we don't know who they are - GDAX tonight was just ridiculous
NO FUD
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:34:13
hodl - i think it should be 100x gold (less polution and so) you will get what you deserve
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:27:42
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:05:53
when you realize that its a manipulated market and the whales will defend the cookie - you can relax - just make sure that you get in when they dump - long run it will go up - as long as regulations won't stop it! 
Beaware of one thing: wealth distribution, transactions, scarcity, mempool &gt; then do your math
Wonder why the mempool is full? fees will kill the lil man - like in banking
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:12:47
dont blame him in the future plz
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:19:15
watch gdax - check orders / history - and look at graph time to time
first check wall 17200 - NOW! again :-P
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:46:16
ok now we have a discussion - namaste
One thing that really is a problem for bitcoin besides its technical limits &gt;  (i dont mean the blockchain as a tech - thats the future - besides ripple and IOTA) is the following:
illegal market actions in blockchain:
- pump dump 
- spoof
- insider trading
- "silk road"history
- unregulated exchanges (how much fiat are they required to hold)
- exchanges backlogg orders or freeze &gt; distorts market
together with a wealth distributions that is off every limit! 
 &gt; others are worse! check LTC
This makes it a real toxic cocktail!
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:55:11

bitfinex is walled at 17'100 if its not spoofing - be careful pushing gdax
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:12:41
to diversify means real stuff - not altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:06:34
i had that too - credit cards will block for your protection when something out of protocol happens - such as giving some company 500$ that is new to your buying behavior - my bank wants a code to clear such payments - they make sure its you and you want this thats all - call your credit card guy....
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:46:29
 wake  up - cash out (if you can!) before shit hits the fan.
Its just a fomo ponzi at the end of the day &gt; the more fomo rush in to support the ballon it might fly to the moon... yeah
the "rich" (rich of what lol) get richer as long as you a good believer and keep hodling  - they prefer when you trade!
as long as you hodl (like they do) you don't get ripped of by exchange and transactions fees instead - but at the end of the day you own HUdfIH54dsfgsfD5FsAHK &gt; some code - who got inflated by wash trading and pump and dump
sorry to say! as long as you didn't cash out you just gave the system your money - if you get it back = good for you
yes i still have btc and iota - but  real
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:26:12
? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:21:25
You can start with ETH at Coinbase! (check dump pump situation 1st) &gt; fast transaction to bitfinex - there you can get most crypto (IOTA too) &gt; ETH way back (avoid whale pumps) 
I don't like BTC for moving to exchanges - slow and high fees. To gamble or Hodl (cold wallet) BTC is ok - rest useless.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:49:01
it's not a bubble thats right - its just market manipulation plus forced scarcity - top 1000 addresses HODL and fill up... and the new fomo will rush in and will push us to the moon - with a lil pump and dump :-)
everyone joining now:
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:36:13
most whitepapers youll find on github - or mean something else?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:45:20
not now - wait &gt; check gdax
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:02:36
wow - paying 15$ plus fees for my beer?  You really think bitcoin will ever return to play a currency! You know that bitcoin needs the volatility to attract new fomo?
plz dont say bitcoin IS blockchain! Blockchain is a superb tech! Bitcoin is just a hype now based on that tech... 
I really hope IOTA keeps goin!
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:03:26
WOW - someone understands the system (lil pyramid 2.0 - with no securities due to non regulation on the way down!)
Whats happens when an exchange closes - all data highly encrypted in chain - money gone?! hmmm
enjoy the ride - but follow the gdax 17250 wall!
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:24:06
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:55:46
sorry mate - if you want statistics go here:
you a fish in the water - accept that and enjoy the rollercoaster - you have no impact - your monthly buyin is required to keep the system running - thats true :-)
regulations kicks in - tax will hit you ... just keep reality in check
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:22:18
there is not one blockchain!
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:40:38
its an unregulated market: 
enjoy the opportunities
accept the threats
What do you think happens in a crash? all exchanges just pay the money? They have to keep some securities - not because of regulation - but because of common sense.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:36:38
YOU DONT HAVE USD ON BITFINEX! for fucks say
you have tether USDT not $
your $ are gone - out of the limbo - unless you try to cash out of the system - then you might see real $ again
google &gt; btc bitfinex tether plz
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:27:13
Yep! pretty accurate imo!
Well the system needs new fresh hodlers to sell to! then drain em!
pump dump spoof benefits whales &amp; groups - they control, do what they want!
How much can exchanges pay out in fiat? - does someone know?
Enjoy the ride or get out - but agree to your logic!
Sell wall 17250 second day! / resistance at 17200 
I watch Gdax all morning - massiv spoofing going on!
Don't buy - hodl! but get ready to dump
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:31:58
dear nevyn
ART has an subjective intrinsic value and become speculation - end of day a monet is a fucking monet - it has its worth in the history of painting ... new stuff sometimes hyped bubblesque
Don't come with stock - stock is equity for fucks sake! uffff
I invested in a start up - you think evluation is just playing with numbers? its isnt trust me
yes paypal - but paypal is based on real currency - with value - no volatility no wash traiding bots with pump dumps...
BLOCKCHAIN AINT BITCOIN - why dont u get that? Digital money will come but it will come from the gov! not by us who hype a price to the moon just because we want it
make "money"now but dont forget to cash out to real money one day

getting money in is easy - just grab your credit card
getting it out is hard - specially during rough times like now at the peak!
check gdax - now &gt; buyers and sellers clashing - epic

i didn't mean you directly - its annoying:
press = ponzi / reddit = FUD - maybe truth is in between!
What the lady said btw! is just economics - its no FUD &gt; because of this dont get the illusion that regulations wont come!
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:06:20
1. just how the system works! no conspirancy here
fee = Bytes x sat/B (priority) x USD/s! 
everything below 100sat/b will be stuck unconfirmed in the mempool for a while!
yes bitcoin got useless for buying a beer!
(order, pay ....... wait... get charged 15$ plus..... drink :-P)
PS: if we see a price drop at this stage or a starting crash - this will make it collaps imo....
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:25:40
:-) I know - hey guess I love governance - survival of the fittest doesn't work...
I come from Switzerland - we have frozen a lot of dictorship and holocaust money - guess crypto works for local exchanges, daily use, fast easy transactions ... but in a world of bitcoin the world would become one giant silkroad.
yes we can use blockchain and tangle tech in the future - but we wont need bitcoin for that.
If IOTA is for real it has potential - not as a currency but as a real life solution.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:00:37
i think you dont understand how pump dump works... they profit in both directions
dumps: cash in from fomo that buys overpriced shit - get an opportunity to buy back at lower rate
dumps: need so fomos think its a good chance to enter the game
pumps: let the fomo shoot over the moon with your cheap bought shit - exit on top (you control dump)
pumps: give people the feeling that they can become rich
VOLATILITY / SCARCITY / MARKET MANIPULATION = CRYPTO - live or die with it
it's not free market - glad you understand that!
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:05:02
could be a second account - no :-)?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:21:28
I doubt that trading a crypto is tax - cause the whole crypto eco is shut off form the outside - they probably tax the shit out of you when you "transfer" it into the real world....
How they wanna tax this:
I sell you a banana for a pony because I think the pony grows quicker and is more worth after the pony i buy a dogecoin just for the fun and then I find someone who wants to spend 3$ on that dogecoin - what would they charge you? i guess taxes on the 3 dollars...  
I hope you guys understand that you will pay shitloads of taxes for your wash traded pump dump coins if shit really hits the fan...
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:41:16
dont post in HODL-Town ... senseless :-)
U almost got it on point - but people believe there is potential! It has a really good potential to go to the moon:
- illegal dump/pump &amp; spoof is ok here
- FOMO - rush of guys who fear to miss out
- reddit is more real than media
- people think bitcoin is blockchain
- moon stories - 100'000 / no 1'000'000 / no it will be bigger then M2 USA....
- etc.
time will tell :-)

Shall we team up start a startup + ICO ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:14:04
1. people admire monet some hate him - its a artist you /&amp;/=)
2. Equity is high risk investment - well done
3. lets say you make a series A - you know what i mean lol?
4. paypal - visa - american express - wtf you talk about? if your product is better you will sell it! bitcoin is just not a product!
its a testcase based on a tech called blockchain - thats all -and it failed regarding low fee and fast transactions 
5. do you think they say - ohhhh please can we use your bitcoin - yes one of your inflated coins is 1'000'000£ thats cool for us - they wont even use your blockchain - they will build an own one - thats SUITS the regulations the have to follow _ BASEL III 
google it 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:07:08
well the masses pushed it above 17'000 - and it will rise until the balance starts to shift:
HODL + FOMO VS People who made enough to exit or People who stop believing the brainwash.
you have to accept the comin regulations and tax laws - you really think bitcoin will outrun M2 of the U.S.A? 
yeah sure - i think you understand the situation really clear!  But it ain't over till the music stops - then we see how much you can really stress the mempool, how exchanges are prepared to deal with people cashing out - if you get in now (today) you are whale pray - thats all... 
Watching GDAX today is like this: NO FUD
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:16:28
if you say so - i trust you
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:42:14
if you dont have the "fear of missing out" in you - you could consider yourself ready for the challenge if you not fear losing &gt; you safe!
for today i recommend watchin gdax - its really epic
feels like a pre endgame imo! 
100+ wall at 17000 /17200 &gt; 17250 is a monster waiting
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:49:48
did you cash out - is it on your real bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:30:08
why is this fud - because they dont recommend 100% Hodl to the moon?
Why cant you stay reflected and have to scream "FUD / Ponzi" all the time?

dear lebo44 - since you seem like a toughtful person:
I know some things - not much - about markets..... noone can guarantee you that the equity or whatever will go in demand and price up infinitily ... When you look back and think - "oh lucky me / oh shit why didnt i see"... you do one thing wrong... you can't define growth nor value by the past! you need to look at the present.
Is bitcoin the future of everyday trading -&gt; no, not if you look at it today. I didn't want hype xrp nor IOTA!
At the end of the day its about one thing - living the moment &gt; you miss out on that while you hope for a better future and hodl &gt; make sure it's not greed and fomo that prevents you from reducing risks.
take care

regulations are growing worldwide - tax debates come - exchanges are stressed - mempool is full - unconfirmed transactions grow - christmas time - people have difficulties to cash out quick - ......   
maybe its just a block to load for the final moon run - i dont know
wealth distribution 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:03:22
unconfirmed transactions + fees + exchanges + lenghty cash outs + fomo + hodl + whales + pump dump + ignorance + regulations + tax + GREED = toxic
lets go for the moon .... ehm - no lets read the whitepaper

i was watching GDAX since 2h - there was and is a massiv spoof bull wave luring fomo up - up to 50 fake buy orders &gt; will it run into the massiv 17250 sell wall.
we know the dump and pump from groups and whales distort the market - but today is AGAIN diffrent - we will see if that wall is meant to stay AGAIN! this is really a interesting time!
Think it that way - if you sit on a big load of coins as a EA - u have so much money NOW - so you have to get rid of it step by step - sell it to the fomo growd. Not to fast - but not to slow either - cause you need to check for yourself how stable the bubble is...
EPIC week - what a ride :-) making money up and down
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:46:49
it aint a currency anymore - please reflect!
It worked maybe at 1000USD = 1BTC / before the bubble hype!
Transaction min. cost: Years ago
230B x 20sat/B x 0.00001$/s = 0.046$
Transaction min. cost: Now! 
230B x 140sat/B x 0.00017$/s = 5$   (NOT stuck in mempool)
Transaction min. cost: 1st MOON (100'000 USD)
230B x 1000sat/B x 0.001$/s = 230$
Transaction min. cost: PEAK (1'000'000 USD)
230B x 5000sat/B x 0.01$/s = 11'500$
GREED kills Bitcoin - go home FOMO / HODL
We need a correction down to 2 - 3000 $ = 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:37:30
the "money" is save in the system - trouble will be regulations considering USE and change to fiat i suspose in the future - crypto tax havens incoming - i bet :-)
this is a second economic revolution - it will test if greed or common sense will win on the long run.
Do a SWOT in a peaceful moment :-)

it's not overpaying &gt; 200 - 300 sat/B is not enough anymore!
what do you think happens will shit the fan &gt; they will "pay" 1000+ - but still they have to cash out first!
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:20:40
gdax 17250 lol - dont manipulate new fomo please!
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:34:10
ehmm - what aggregation do you use :-)
HODL = whale bait - up and down ....
lern to swim with em 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:19:54
Are you afraid of missing out? - Stay out
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:24:06
system overload - wait for whats going to happen when more want to cash out - NO FUD intended!
just make sure you know how the system out works - forget about fees - its about time! just my tip - i tried to exit with a  part last weekend, still stuck in process
plus IOTA stuck at BITFINEX since a week :-/

No offense but you and our famous Mr. Andreas M. Antonopoulos....
He is a very good seller - respect! But google &gt;  
BTW - how much gold, water, REE, REM, etc. is in a ASCI mining rig?
How much carbon footprint does it need to build one? Just wondering...
I love blockchain - but that bitcoin sect stuff annoys me - sry
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:05:45
wow - respect! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:52:19
doesn't the dump pump dump cycles effect market price at all? - just supply and demand?
I think that people think bitcoin IS blockchain :-P
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:10:10
wtf are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:57:32
think about that - all the guys investing millions into ASCI rigs - they want there investment back! And everytime you will move your asset currency or whatever - they make money! 
At the moment volatility by pump / dump is the intrinsic value of bitcoin - soon as that gets regulated - exchanges will have a problem.. &gt; higher exchange fees / miners too &gt; so they will regulate HS Power to keep mempool full.....
Conspirancy now: why you think Coinbase / GDAX want 1MB blocks?
it's a set up - profit on they way up but exit before it crashes - my advice
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:08
coinbase is not bank and 1 BTC is not 19'000$ as long as you cashed it in - you and me could wash trade 1 BTC to 10000000000000000000000000 USD - but chances that the hot dog guy at the street corner will laugh at us is high...
YOU LOST ALL as long as you didn't get it out! If banks fail - they are regulated - at least my country :-) 75'000.- is protected...
BIG TO FAIL - its not a bank again - if cryptos pop - it will just harm the people inside the bubble ... you think the hot dog guy gives a fuck that you invested in a HJKf87fdhjkSFD code? 
Bitcoin uses blockchain - the fed could make a digital USD with blockchain or tangle tech behind it - no one needs bitcoin (maybe KIM the rocket man, ISIS and CO)
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:08:00
not correct - "to NOT get"...
yep - system needs new fomos... but it isnt a classical Ponzi imo - its more complicated... for sure the biggest "thing" in my lifetime.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:00:18
thats why i invested in:  again
- a start up (i know founders)
- funds (robotics, water and global megatrends)
- equity
hold very lil:
- xrp &amp; IOTA
- last coins
you won't get rich from bitcoin anymore - delusion of fomos and fresh hodlrs - read news
4 your info - Reuters ain't fudster
