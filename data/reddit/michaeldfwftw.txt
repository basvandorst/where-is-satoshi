This seems to be coinbase not your bank. I had this problem with USAA today, and read a little farther into the /r and you'll see someone say the same thing about chase. Coinbase is reversing the transactions, not the bank

You are probably right, and I realized after posting what I did that, although I know what I said was true (except the speculation of how many he holds today which, even if I am off by 50%, is serious coin(pun totally intended)), I really don't have any business talking about his business anyway.

I received a note today from coinbase saying "oops, sorry that was our fault not your banks and we have our shit together now". 
Paraphrasing, of course.

Also that whole "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" thing? Ya I followed that. So I am not sweating. I don't WANT to lose the capital I have tied up but I CAN lose it without losing my life/lifestyle.

I'm not a big player, I don't have a lot tied up on crypto. But I did my first purchase at right around $1K. I did another couple around $2K, and my last purchase was at about $8K. I am probably blended at $3,500/BC (most of my holdings are BC but I have a few alts too). Why sell? I am not certain we are going to get close to the $20K mark again any time soon, but I think we might. But I think for sure its going to find a floor above $5K, so I'm still good.

I would think you could log into coinbase from any computer, go through the verification process, and then get your app working. Most laptops today come with built in cameras, so borrow a friend's laptop and make it happen!
