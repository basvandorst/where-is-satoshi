My dads been a long time day trader. I first bought btc at 4300, the whole way up he said BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE. Now I’ve been on bittrex and hold a bunch of coins and every day he asks how my portfolio is doing and is interested

When you do this, the coinbase desktop site says $0 fee, but when you click view transaction and it takes you to blockcypher, it shows the fee there. Please correct me if I’m wrong
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:42:06
It was the other way around until the 2017 aventador came out. Holy fuck that car is absolutely breath taking.

I discovered this as well, however I believe there still some fees involved. When you send coin from gdax to another address, you can view the transaction on the block chain if you go to coinbase&gt;accounts&gt; find your recent transaction and click view transaction. It’ll tell you the fee placed on it. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

Strange that that’s your top results. My top 3 and even the ad at the top are for the real site. Shitty how they even got your 2FA
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:08:52
It looks like you got great advice before I commented. I was trying to make sense of his commentary. But I guess you actually did drop 10s of thousands. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:31:23
Yup! Totally forgot about it. I wonder how much money they gave away
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:43:21
Yes and/or bittrex

Congradufuckinglations man. My dad got one in September and it is absolutely the most incredible car you will ever own/drive/see/hear/experience.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:02:17
I have some in gdax for trading, also in alt coins, the rest in Bread Wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:30:10
I’m seeing almost $100 differences. As of 10:30pm Eastern. Coinbase: 6878. GDAX: 6960
Edit: when I️ go to the buy tab and enter an amount, it shows the normal price. Except inflated a little because coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:30:43
lmao okay short story. It’s a drink brand and a few years back issued a recall and said if you bought some at this time you qualify for a refund. I lied about buying it and they sent me a check for $5 so I had the site bookmarked 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:57:35
Yes perfectly normal. But next time you should ask these questions before submitting your info. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:32:34
There are people kicking themselves for not buying at .01 in 2010 or so and now it’s at 10k. Don’t sweat it just be glad you’re part of this at such a young age 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:44:29
Did you give them a password that you use for anything else? If so, change everything 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:48:30
I was like 14 and it was free money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:43
Gdax to sell with limit orders. No fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:02:51
He either did that or referred to his portions of a single coin as bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:56
Exactly and when you can, just buy a little more here and there. Never invest what you can’t afford to lose 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:39:45
Ffs. Are there still fees going from gdax to bittrex?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:49:44
I only needed one hand to record 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:36:23
Seriously? I’ve done it before and it was never that high 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:41:26
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:42:09
What do you recommend 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:43:00
I’m not gonna try to discourage you from mining, just research a lot before you do anything. It’s very time, money, and energy consuming and requires your computer to run at full speed 24/7
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:34:50
I suppose trading bitcoin counts. I like to look at r/slavelabor and see if I can complete any tasks there. I also deliver food for DoorDash and Postmates here and there to make some cash to get through college 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:15:33
How did you end up there and what did they ask for?
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:28:47
Idk if you saw teslas announcement an hour ago, but the roadster 2.0 will shit on anything at the Nurburgring 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:27:11
Tried to buy LTC at 77, coinbase says fuck u, I can’t buy, LTC goes to 90. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:29:21
Don’t worry about mining bitcoin. Not with people who have hundreds of cards on racks mining. Without a rig like that it’s literally more profitable to buy some and hold it
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:55:36

@_date: 2017-11-29 04:34:44
Gdax.com. If you have a coinbase account you can login with that info, they’re synonymous 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:37:35
Good start. I hope you get your switch too, I have one it’s a great console 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:22:07
I do. Sorry for shaking with [excitement](
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:11
I moved all my shit into a mobile wallet and only just went back to coinbase to buy LTC 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:48:14
I bought in for $150 for the first time at 4200 last weekend, then bought $100 at 3100 I'm feeling aight
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:16:21
Could you ELI 5 shorting BTC? I understand it with the stock market, but how do you bet on Btc going down?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:51:24
Right so just selling high and buying back low?
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:02:04
I'm 19, just this morning I made a coinbase account and put $150 in! 
Quick question, what does it mean when it says it will take 3-4 take to buy if using a bank account instead of a debit card? If I chose that, does it make the purchase at the value BTC is at the time of purchase? Or when it withdrawals?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:22:03
Density 2 isn't on steam
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:43:49
Shoulda bought 3 years ago
Or last Friday at 4am

No worries, screw anyone who shits on your for asking questions, we’ve all been there.

I found that one when I searched for bitcoin checker, it looks like it’ll be good for percentage alerts, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:41:30
Can you explain real quick wtf fiat is?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:47:55
So where do I put my coins if not coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:50:52
Someone misspelled hold and it went viral and now it’s our meme/inside joke
