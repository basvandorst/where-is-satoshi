The reality is that bitcoin and crypto is a competitive environment where if it doesn't adapt and evolve quickly enough to provide value that people and businesses need...other products are sure to fill that void.

This isn't credit card fraud.  The bank spoke with the fraudster and changed the online credentials allowing an e-transfer.  They failed to ask for the password setup on the account by the account holder.

@_date: 2015-05-22 20:07:27
I agree that bitcoin is volatile.  My point is that where bitcoin is likely to look attractive is in places where it's less volatile or more convenient than traditional options.  In other words, where there is real incentive to use bitcoin.  Here in Canada, there's so little incentive to use bitcoin for the average person that I don't see much prospects for widespread adoption.
However, if I was a foreign worker and someone introduced me to a way to save $40 each time I sent money home, then you have my interest.

If storage is done correctly theft is virtually impossible.  Whereas, most people assume their money is 100% protected by the banks when it may not be.
The scariest part is where the consumer advocate talks about how banks are aggressive in blaming customers for fraud and it's common practice to not reimburse them for fraud.

My guess is the price will continue to drop as the post $1000 buyers slowly lose faith.  Additionally the darkening global economy could force holders to feel the need to liquidate in light of falling prices.
I agree with OP that falling prices are a good thing as it attracts more adopters like myself.  The strength of a currency is in how many people are willing to use it I suppose.
@_date: 2015-05-13 00:51:55
With bitcoin you hold the responsibility for the security in your hands.  I doubt you read the article or watched the video.  
The customer called the bank to notify them her ID was stolen.  She had a password on her account which the bank didn't ask for when the fraudster changed her online passwords.  Clearly the bank was at least partly responsible for the loss and refused to reimburse any money until the victim went to the media.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:17:01




Upvote to eternity.  Why would I use bitcoin if it's more expensive or equal to using a credit card which is significantly simpler and guaranteed by my credit card company?
For bitcoin to cut its strings and become a real boy, it must nurture and strengthen its competitive advantages over traditional payment channels and not copy their weaknesses.  A failure to do so is a risk for the very survival of bitcoin.

Way I see it is it's a chicken and egg scenario.  Does adoption of the currency occur first? Or, does adoption of the BC happen first?  In my mind it's irrelevant which is it, only that they are inseparable.  In fact, my guess is that the BC will garner huge support dragging along the currency until it slaps people in the face that bitcoin is the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:48:42
Makes sense.  Perhaps taking the average is a decent guess: $1700ish?  Definitely more expensive than I was thinking as a retirement destination.

@_date: 2015-05-22 19:22:04
This is precisely why I believe bitcoin's success will be driven by adoption outside of First World nations.  Africa,  South America, and Asia is where bitcoin can make a difference in people's lives now.

I'm not implying that cash in the bank is at serious risk, only that the article shows there is a modicum of risk involved.  At the end of the day, the bank has it's interests ahead of yours and due to human error (customer service failed to ask the fraudster for the account password) the lady was out $2K.
Cold storage&gt;Bank Deposits.
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:30:23
My credit card charges 24% interest but because I pay it off every month I never pay any, so I use it like cash or bitcoins for the 2% rewards.  If not for the free 2% rewards, extra warranty, fraud protection I would use cash or debit.  But because my credit card offers an advantage over cash and debit I use it.
Like you my bitcoins have gone up in value but changes to the political, environmental, social or technological factors affecting bitcoin can drastically change that outcome.  
As an adopter, you've experienced the quickness with which the value can change both ways.  In the end the market will decide bitcoin's future.  If devs can pivot quickly enough to continue to improve bitcoin amid evolving market demand it will continue to grow.  If they don't, bitcoin will flounder.

For someone who is cautiously suspicious of lightning network, I appreciate your explanation.  I'm not against lightning network per se but more the lack of flexibility being demonstrated by this debate.  Perhaps lightning is the panacea for bitcoin and mass adoption, but perhaps it is not.

This is analogous to what's happening to oil.  Supplies are at all time highs because the downward price pressure forces producers to output more oil to combat the losses in profit.  Unfortunately the excess supply exerts more downward pressure on the price of oil.

No doubt the price goes up, but what gets me thinking is if banks start to use bitcoin to process payments then you would think that they would need to stock bitcoin in huge numbers to accommodate volumes.
Personally, if adoption by the banks happens I see the demand skyrocketing.  Clearly we're still very far from that happening otherwise we'd see banks purchasing bitcoin ahead of inevitable demand/price increase.
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:56:00
Easy buddy...just a friendly discussion here.  I don't know enough to say that a permissioned system will be significantly cheaper with less or equal security risks to what their current closed systems offer.

What if Paypal decides that the transaction looks suspicious and freezes the transfer and your account?  What if the money was urgently needed by a family member?
The upside to bitcoin will always be the absence of a central authority who, at their discretion, can change the rules of the game  beyond your control.  For some, the total control of your wealth offered by bitcoin can be a risky proposition because one misstep can mean big losses.

I don't see centralization and security as being significant risks at this point.  By its nature bitcoin and its community can avoid control by any entity should they attempt to steer bitcoin or change it in ways which are antithetical to its current values.
I would think governments and other structures would learn from digital media that trying to control and suppress p2p is an exercise in futility and achieves the opposite.

@_date: 2015-02-04 17:12:36
Couldn't agree more.  There's not a lot of incentive right now for G7 citizens to adopt bitcoin.  The vast majority of people I know value "simplicity, stability, and security" over the benefits the blockchain offers.
I put them in quotes as it's really a perceived sense of them that the traditional banking systems offer. People care less about the inherent safety a distributed network offers compared to a centralized system when VISA will refund any fraudulent charges
Strategically, it makes sense for bitcoin entrepreneurs to focus on third world countries as they're in a better position to benefit from bitcoin than say Americans or Canadians.  Adoption would be much easier to achieve, one would think.
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:04:15
