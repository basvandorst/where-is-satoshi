From a legal standpoint, that won't work. US citizens are taxed on their worldwide income, no matter which country they reside in. And if you renounce your US citizenship, any unrealized capital gains are realized and taxes due at that point.

In what time frame has crypto ever had less volatility than Rolexes?

You probably could have used xe.com. They can pull the money out using ACH (that's what Circle used when you gave it your routing and account number), and then it would have done the forex for you and deposited AUD in your Australian bank account. Their forex is really cheap too.

If you're so sure you can predict the future value of Bitcoin, why don't you put your money where your mouth is and [short BTC](

Signal client and server are in fact GPL. And Open Whisper Systems has published papers on the Signal Protocol. Hardly what you would consider "proprietary".

Wow, check out their website: 
It's hilariously bad and unbelievable; they don't even attempt to explain how the deposits generate a return. Makes me feel really bad for all the poor uneducated people who must be taken in by this. :(

GPG is never going to achieve adoption outside of its niche user base right now. The real future is in end to end messaging apps like Signal. Not only is it far easier and more convenient to use, but it produces even less metadata (i.e. basically none) than sending mail through GPG. It turns out federal employees (presumably Clinton supporters) [are using it to thwart Trump](

I'm friends with one of the girls in the conversations. It's real.

Actually, not really. I have a trivial amount (0.3 BTC) which isn't for investment purposes. I would never advocate for someone to invest in Bitcoin; it's not a smart investment. You'd have better luck picking stocks than trying to predict Bitcoin's future value.
However, that being said, a crucial difference which you seemed to have missed is that Kipi is a ponzi scheme whereas Bitcoin is not. The whole premise behind Bitcoin is that it's a digital currency. It never promises any returns.

so, basically.

No. macOS ships with an old version of bash which doesn't support the feature being talked about (being able to convert an escape code like '\u20bf' into a unicode character ₿).
If you can see the character ₿ in this post, it means your system already has the new unicode character.

I believed this too until just now, when I tried to find a study to link to the person below you. Seems like although alcohol might help reduce mortality in traumatic injuries, [it's not due to the "relaxation effect"](






(Actual study is here:  )

This is the correct answer for people wondering why OP's command doesn't work on their machine. If you install the latest bash from homebrew (4.4.5) and start it up, `echo -e \\u20bf` should work.
Of course, if you can see the bitcoin symbol here: ₿ (and elsewhere in the thread) you get same effect.

Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value. If no one else uses it as a currency, it has no value. Gold has intrinsic value, because even if no one used it as a currency, its usefulness in electronics, manufacturing, etc. would not be diminished.

Most cryptocurrencies' blockchains are not being used for much outside of a currency. Of the ones that are, it's debatable how much value they actually provide. Arguing that there are *potential* uses is not the same thing as having intrinsic value right now.

Publicly traded stocks aren't that much of a gamble (at least compared to bitcoin). They have to regularly report their financials, they're held accountable by shareholders, and generally they're expected to turn a profit. Bitcoin has none of these; it's purely speculation.
