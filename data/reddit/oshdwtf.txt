Why didn't you just use bitcoin? I mean that's what you're preaching right?
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:45:20
Tf you mean NSFW with a question mark..?

Shut the fuck up
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:07:17
This had nothing to do with beauty but I'm happy for you nonetheless. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:04:54
Okay, but did you buy your car with bitcoin profit? I believe that was the point he was making.
@_date: 2019-02-11 00:28:27
The problem with Bitcoin is nobody spends it and everyone just holds on to it in hopes to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:09:24
you're late
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:23:31

Fuck em.

I can't tell if joking or just genuinely delusional. People were saying the same thing at 5k.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:54:32
You're delusional.
@_date: 2018-11-18 08:05:09
Keep going back another year to justify the dip. Okay.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:39:58
Do you really need advice in this current climate? lmfao

Nice pic of your rear end OP! lookin’ good.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:44:02
OP is salty
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:51:48
Not much
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:13:04
Yeah... That's gonna be a no from me dawg.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:53:09
how come?
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:19:46
This is great if I want to turn my $18.21 into $12.13 overnight.
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:02:21
This isn't a get rich quick scheme... oh wait
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:50:05

Hampton Brandon's scamin out the mansion still I see
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:57:40
Well probably because it's a valid question. I love how so many of you want Bitcoin to grow and thrive but you're not open to helping newcomers understand the complexities of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:36:49
Looks like all downhill from there tbh
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:20:28
Well yes but that's not exactly the best way of problem solving. Look at global warming for example. People procrastinating or not being proactive because it wont affect their time on Earth. I'm just intrigued that coins have this major flaw and how the creators suggest we go about navigating these issues. Right now people are banking on a solution
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:16:02
So if we stopped printing USD, people would stop using it? It wouldn't just adjust its global worth compared to other currencies? 
I do agree on mining being a waste of resources in it's current infrastructure though.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:35:50
Cockroaches get crushed. GL OP.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:47:59
Maybe don't brag about your investment to begin with and you wouldn't have to hear about how shit it's doing.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:16:27
Nice.. I can turn my 88 cents into 63 cents overnight!
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:30:08
Bitcoin is drilling a hole to China at this point.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:37:42
Somebody please explain this to me. When all 21 million Bitcoins are mined, wont people still need to "mine" to keep the network up? Would the fees that they get ever be worth the electricity to continue to support the network? Pardon my ignorance on this subject. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:08:25
Explain your thought process behind this please.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:00:06
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about u/The-Physicist. u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:03:09
But that has nothing to do with what I was asking. I'm asking why people would want to "mine" after all of the blocks are gone. You need people to continue to "mine" to keep the network up. The fees don't seem like they'd be worth the electricity. If fees go up though, Bitcoin is less useful because transactions will cost more.
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:43:43
Depends on when you bought in. It's a gamble right now either way.
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:42:00
You sound like the beginning of 2018 again. Have fun living in your delusion.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:15:45
Thank you for the informative response!
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:19:05
I feel the same way about climate change. /s
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:33:01
Bitcoin is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:38:17
Of course not. This place is an echo chamber.
