The government creating its own bitcoin protocol would not be a threat to anyone.
@_date: 2013-08-18 18:07:42
The government can't modify the bitcoin protocol without every individual using bitcoin agreeing to use the modifications. Bitcoin is open source so if someone doesn't like the change they (and people like them) will just not update, forking the blockchain.

This is a great question. Please copy paste me the answer when you answer it.
@_date: 2013-08-08 15:41:19
Neither of those statements is true.
@_date: 2013-08-08 15:33:21
Thanks. That was enlightening.

Can tails run VM? 
@_date: 2013-08-11 12:40:24
No. No, wait. Yes.

I'm glad I obfuscated my identity when bitcoins weren't in the public eye. I never used my real name or anyone else's for just this reason.

This is my favorite comment on all of Reddit. And I've been around a while despite the new name.

Why are you mad? Your mileage may vary depending on what circles you keep. QED
@_date: 2013-08-07 18:47:45
That's a facile apology at best.
@_date: 2013-08-08 21:58:30
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2013-08-13 17:39:21
I don't get this reference.
@_date: 2013-08-18 16:05:23
No he's right. It is a common phrase. It only comes up when the term needs to be used so your mileage may very depending on what circles you keep but it is common.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:33:06
All comments are in their original form. They are fine. I still want a freaking answer.

That no one would use. 
When I imagine the future I don't see the USD.

Maybe it's a mistranslation and he meant, like, claim it in some way. Like China implicitly did by running positive news stories.

I would give you gold if I could

English, how does it work? 
@_date: 2013-08-08 15:29:02
What are the significant differences? 
@_date: 2013-08-15 15:13:44
Somewhere along the way Reddit changed my sense of humor. It's much more high-intellectual. I just want to say I lol'd.
@_date: 2013-08-22 15:29:54
I like your name.
@_date: 2013-08-15 01:54:21
I'm not saying it's likely I'm just asking what if.
@_date: 2013-08-18 22:12:34
What is the government going to do force everyone to upgrade to their version and delete any trace of the old client from the internet? Because that it's what it would have to do to establish any kind of (il)legitimate change to the protocol. That is why it is no that. Because it cannot happen. It is virtually impossible.
