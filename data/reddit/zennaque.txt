It's a famous pizza, first one bought with bitcoin and acted as a, 'proof of concept'
It's often joked about how 5 years ago the cost of that pizza was 10,000 bitcoins.

Last I checked though, a pizza costs 10,000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-06-08 05:38:23
You don't get the craving to buy pizza that often at that kind of price.

Even in the Birthday paradox, the numbers don't show a very notable probability until you hit 1% of the total days of the year(and that's still a very low chance, 4 people in a room matching). Notice that this case is also different, in that the blockchains already can't match, lowering the chance exponentially, since it is one sided with a random virus signature matching a blockchain code. The possible strings were are talking about, rather than having a limit of 365 days, has trillions upon trillions more combinations than identified virus signatures and used block chains.

Well first off, people lost money(me). Also, a lot of media associated MtGox with the trustworthiness of bitcoin itself, and a good chunk of trust was lost towards the entire community.

As a freshman in college, losing 3 bitcoins was a bit of a loss for me. At the moment I see them as gone, but if by some miracle I see them again, then that's simply fantastic. I never have a lot of money to spare, but this was a good example of not investing more than you can bare to lose. If I put in as much as I wanted I would be much worse off right now.

Yes, but the method proposed by McAfee was way off the mark. Actual method used is unknown/was a bug purchased for millions.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:32:54
Didnt McAfee promise to eat a shoe if he couldn't unlock that iPhone from that one big case? Also said something about how McAfee only hired the best programmers by asking them if they understood xor.

Yup. I believe the interview question was given two drives, A and B, switch all the contents between them using only logic expressions and no outside memory. Kinda crazy how he acted like it had some big mysterious solution

Are you planning on selling some in exchange for products? The fundamentals of Bitcoin is that it's another currency, with lots of unique properties, not that it's an investment option.

Pretty awesome. I'd want one of those buttons for myself.

Why central standard time? Anyways, $222.22
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:38:01
I thought I was being reasonable when I decided I'd try to get more if the price went below $140 the day it hit $160...

Monetary trust is what I'm specifically referring to, and Silk Road specifically incorporates personal trust with monetary trust, like trading with someone over craigslist or something. If hundreds of people stored their money on a .onion site and then the creators just up and closed it, there'd be no real way to get the money back if it's a .onion site because of that anonymity.

Alas, I don't possess "geeky stuff" to tip

I put in only what I was willing to lose and will hold out for the long run. Of course, I was only willing to lose $100 and put in at $120 since I'm a broke Highschool student.

The opportunity to start a real life treasure hunt should be taken advantage of. Just drop a couple hints at trial and see if anyone ever figures it out.

Almost a $200-air after my $100 investment last week, though it took a week in the bitinstant forums to get it all through and good, was going to put $500 in but hesitated after having trouble with the $100 test venture.

Don't worry, people with BTC are already great at buying things discretely, one of the biggest appeals of BTC.

I tried looking briefly to no avail, but I recall he also mentioned it was payment for a single large graphic arts project if that helps spark a memory for anyone who may have seen it.

I was willing to treat Liberty Reserve like Paypal, but it's tough to put that kind of monetary trust into any .onion site. Plus, financial transactions want documentation and what not, yet people would be more than willing to use stolen identities on something like Tor.
The thing people were focusing were "sites **like this** can operate anonymously", the basis of their nature hinders the process.

I thought the purpose of the post was irony. "Just cashed out 3 Bitcoins only to be reminded why I like Bitcoin in the first place."
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:16:07
Went through the comments, didn't see it. What's your story? When/for how much did you buy the Bitcoins? Was there a time when you had a larger quantity? Did you have a moment where you almost lost faith and cashed out?
I'm sure many others are as curious as I am, it's like story time for tech lovers and BTC investors
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:51:00
Similar in all aspects except 18/single, though this may change with my massive .8 BTC fortune (alas, no funds to invest).

When this bubble first started shooting past $100 they put one specific person over on bitcointalk.org, it was this time that I was having my issues. I kind of got to watch as URSAY (the person they hired) gradually got more and more systematic in processing. My issue took 6 days before being resolved, and it was on the 5th day that URSAY started a method that addressed the problem you have, letting people know what was being worked on. I believe URSAY keeps this up now, posting a list each day of who's issues are being worked on.
Typically they just need your order ID and sometimes your zipzap account  It wasn't the most enjoyable experience, waiting six days while the price was constantly going up, but in the end I got the price at purchase. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:44:48
Yeah, standard metric naming except for that 10K quantity.
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:49:46
This whole situation makes me curious. Are there any banks out there that charge -.1% interest and just hold onto the money without loaning it out? Or are people really into getting those extra pennies every year?

What I hate is the attitude. This is the government saying that all the money in the country is theirs, and that what you have is what they permit you to have.

Full time student... in Highschool. Don't really make any online purchases/have any money, but still enjoy watching as BitCoin gets more and more popular.
