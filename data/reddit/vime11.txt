I see pupils play their games connected with their wallets and pay with the exact same wallet for food in their school with any game assets they want. This includes the possibility that they pay with their prefered option and the school get btc by default. Blockchain will bring together what belongs together. Gaming universe with real life. 
If we assume that people will spend more and more time in digital worlds and these worlds will be more and more become a natural "home", I cant see how people want to see their assets on centralised server.

Lets be honest. Crypto art is almost always ugly.

See my thoughts above. And this is my first conversation where I truly be reminded on my first btc days, where I had to fight so much skepticism. 


Allright buttonstraddle.

Ok, I get your point. Fair enough. 
I strongly believe, that a smart contract platform will create an infrastructure where we cant imagine yet what ideas will pop up and what possibilities will be created on. Similar to the internet. 
But it is hard to deny, that btc is the better investment right now.

It is not that easy to talk about every possible usecases of a smartcontract platform, thats why I chose the most easiest one imo.

You sound like people in 2013. But these people pointed to my btc.

I am btc and eth holder and strongly believe in both. But when I am listening to btc maximalists, I wonder why they have so much disbelief in eth. They even call it useless. To clarify my confusion, I have a question for you.
Will it be possible to bring gaming assets on the bitcoin blockchain? And if so, when and how? If not, do you see the gaming industry moving to blockchain at all?

Why the fuck was crypto kitties such a huge success? And why are so many publishers looking at blockchain and its possibilities?

Don’t spread false assumptions. Why do you think the average person hates bitcoin. The average person just doesn’t care about bitcoin. But there is definitely no hate. 
But if you start annoying the average person constantly with your bitcoin hype you can guess the result.

I think you are very smart then. So yes, you are probably right. I should reconsider my position. 
Thank you very much buttonstraddle

The solution to bring gaming assets to blockchain is imo defenitely a billion dollar question. Publishers get completley new scenarios to create and sell items.
