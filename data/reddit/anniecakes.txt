I don't trade, I basically set-it-and-forget-it/HODL. So it doesn't sound like I know enough to help you :(, but I wish you luck!!

So do they actually say "Two November"? "The Second of November"? Then it's really long... "November Second" is faster. MURICA!! ;)
I actually am curious how they say "2 November" though.

So the most logical way is definitely YYYY-MM-DD, since you want the highest-level information first.
In *most* day-to-day applications, you're dealing with dates that are *this year*. Thus, having the year at the front is just superfluous and distracting. So, move it to the back!
For most day-to-day use, I think this works great, since the month is the highest-level *useful* information.
DD-MM-YYYY, to me is stupid, and here's why: you see the least useful piece of information first. The day by itself? It means literally nothing without the month context. 1? 31? It doesn't mean anything! So when reading, you'd parse practically useless information first, and *then* you're given the context to interpret it.
So for day-to-day use, I actually think MM-DD-YYYY is dope! Most of the dates we're dealing with in everyday life, we already know the year -- it's 2017! So the *most useful* information is "what month is it?" - that gives you most of what you need to know.
And when you're archiving/keeping records, oftentimes you separate them by year, anyway. If you don't, then the computer either automatically sorts the date stamp, or you use YYYY-MM-DD because at that point... duh! Why would you sort on month first across multiple years? (And for DD-MM-YYYY, why would you sort on day? That doesn't even make sense across multiple months, let alone years! (in normal use cases, at least))

I mean they *may* have missed the train to make millions of dollars off BTC, but it's not like there's still not money to be made... I only bought in this summer (despite knowing about it from its inception, ughhhh kicking myself) and I'm very happy with my returns so far. I'm not getting rich, but it's making a huge difference in my financial situation.
