I did read this actually, and when two out of three identical orders are cancelled, I must personally question the validity of his comments.

Sorry for trying to warn others and save someone else the huge hassle and headache myself, brother, and father have been through the last week :/

Thanks for the input. I hope what people are saying is true and my family will get the bitcoins at the price we paid for.

*Human* etiquette includes doing the right thing and bringing others attention to topics that could possibly negatively affect them. Even if it means you get trash talked by the whole bitcoin subreddit. Hopefully one person saw this post and thought twice before going forth with an order from coinbase.

I may have to try that.

I will update this post with the results of the emails. I hope you are right.

With the rate of fluctuation in the bitcoin prices lately it IS an important matter. I'm not sure why I keep getting these responses from people saying this is fine or normal. This is costing my family time to go through the resolution process and in turn possibly costing money due to the fluctuating bitcoin prices. Does no one on this subreddit think losing money is  big deal? I don't get it.

So either the complex machine learning algo is broken or this comment is complete BS. I hope it's the first.

Exactly. Downvoted. This is a very important matter, ESPECIALLY if thirty posts per day are made. Don't you think if one post was upvoted for visibility it would cut down on the posts?

I didn't see a single thread like mine anywhere near the top of the subreddit. If we are getting 30 of these threads a day don't you think it should be up towards the top to warn others so we stop getting these threads.

No apologizing will be made here. I simply stated my experience with a company and plan on updating this post with whatever response we get from the company. We could be losing money here...possibly a LOT of money and you call that raising alarms over nothing? Man I wish I was raised in a family where losing money was 'nothing'.

Not true because my personal order was under 270 and went through.
