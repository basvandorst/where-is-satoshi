I do have other identification like my bank card and proof of my address so I guess most sellers would be willing to work with me. :)

I didn't send it. It's money coming to me. :)

It's money from an investment company, my account on their site says "Note: Withdrawal to account 1FzqSkyoUwif247o1KFihJdxBGRy97TWfZ. Batch is 31050cce8973a49354fe696832ef50353effe14067ab1741943fffef7cc1f5fc" if that means anything to you.   
 It seems that their BTC address has a lot of transactions going in and out.

Now it's onto three confirmations. That took a while. I'm glad it's done now. :)

That's a good point.   
The only store I know of that accepts Bitcoin on the high street is CeX.

Bitcoin Online? Is that a website or do you literally mean it?

I love how it mentions how slow PayPal is compared to bitcoin.

I'm under 18 too, but I have no ID so I don't use coinbase. I've found bittylicious and localbitcoins to be great.

I remember going to make a bank account at the Halifax.  
It felt like it would be easier to rob the bank than to make a legitimate account.  
I ended up going Lloyds, less bullshit.

Buy bitcoins from some sites like coinbase?

Unfortunately I'm a few hundred miles from London. I'm in Cheshire.

I used to, it expired like 7 years ago.

Dunno why you're getting downvoted, they told me on Twitter they are having problems with the support system.
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:48:53
I felt like taking a blood sample and chucking it into the Halifax "is this good enough fucking ID?!?" 
@_date: 2015-09-11 06:52:19
$450 or £450?
@_date: 2015-09-10 15:17:00
I've been waiting nearly a day (24hrs) now. You must have been lucky. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:01:49
They got back to me on Twitter, some delays going on: 
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:02:10
Still waiting for a reply. I'll be honest, I'm disappointed atm with the service. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 15:14:32
Our country treats us like babies, this is one of the reasons why so we can't leave the country in a rush if we wanted to. :)

"Bring some muscle"  
I like it. Lol. :P
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:19:36
I've sent them a PM too. I really hope it gets sorted out.

If the buyer sends the money as "Friends and Family" rather than "Goods" they can't chargeback through PayPal.  
But they could still chargeback through their credit card provider. I'm unsure on how PayPal reacts to that.

You can use it in China but you'll need to use a bridge that isn't in the public dictionary as they're blocked.

Hey, it's your cousin.
