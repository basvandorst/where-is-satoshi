If you're thinking about this- you know others are also. Would be a dark day if something like this were to actually happen.

The hangman selling you the noose.
Satoshi doesn't exist, but the desire to track every transaction you ever made does. NFC/RFID chipping is coming, and it's easy enough to encode your deposit address or account details to that tag.
People are running with open arms to oppression.
However, just as bitcoin is a double edged sword- it's only a tool, and that tool will reflect the desires of the ones wielding it. Our actions will dictate the future.
So, let's make a bright future with the opportunity we've been provided.

Carrington Event - 
Sun-facing side of the planet could be in the dark for ages or until they can wire up new capacitors and replace much of the grid. The dark side of the earth would be ok initially, but that energy would reverberate for a few days resulting in further problems. 
The main issue isn't with the fact that your BTC would be inaccessible (sun-facing side); it's that all nuclear plants would be going into emergency operations. Without backup cooling systems (would be fried also) the plant would go into meltdown.
Gamma-ray burst that can adversely affect electronics as well as gamma radiation is ionizing radiation  (can chance a 1 to a 0 and kill electronics and damage stored data).
You can keep up with space weather here or with their app
Space weather also effects People, and the volatility of the markets. 
Wish I had more information for you, but space weather isn't great for crypto.
Good luck to us all =)
