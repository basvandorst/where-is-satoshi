yes, very slowly. i dont see this spreading much. here in toronto we had a bunch of places where there was crypto ATMs, and some places took it. now its died down much and dont really thinnk there is a crypto scene here anymore.

@_date: 2015-11-13 17:17:15
this would be amazing if canada recognized bitcoin officially. there were a few bitcoin ATM's around the GTA, but were taken away for some reason. i would love to see them back!
@_date: 2015-11-13 20:38:00
that is true. and i agree. it was just kinda cool to see them.
@_date: 2019-05-02 10:32:25
