As you can tell by this graph, it's certainly a great deal closer to $13 than it is $50,000,000.

If you're dollar cost averaging this is a great spot to also start that again modestly if you're being risk averse, too. No need to use massive savings if you can't afford to.

My theory is that whoever is posting all the same FUD over and over is basically 'spending' their reddit karma to post over and over. Today has been full of these accounts posting the same few topics, then having those immediately downvoted and remarked upon, then deleting them as they've failed. Since the negative karma will stay with the user score that posted, eventually they'll have to 'refill' elsewhere in another subreddit, or make a new account and pass around karma to each other. 
What a cancer in our daily thread. Mods, is there a solution to this? Higher account minimums to post won't really work since new users won't be able to participate in real discussion. It seems like heavy moderation is needed particularly in this thread.
**Edit - I'm not referring to the poster here as a cancer. I'm referring to the posts that permeate this thread as such.
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:29:15
Well sure, but that would be fraud.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:01:18
Because if I ever decided to move overseas or travel with more money than would be determined arbitrarily reasonable by some TSA agent, I could buy bitcoin, relocate, then cash it out where I arrived, with no one able to take that away from me or even prove that I have it. Having complete authority over my own monetary decisions seems like something that will be valuable in the future. Price volatility will hopefully end one day, and that's when I believe most widespread adoption will happen.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:43:43
This question has been getting posted by different accounts every few hours to keep it near the top, then it's downvoted and deleted. Someone is clearly trying to steer the narrative here on reddit, be it a group that's shilling against, or institutions trying to make crypto look bad for visitors.

Yeah, I'm having some difficulty sympathizing with him given the details in the application that clearly indicate he went out of his way to ignore controls that he'd even acknowledged were in place. 
To make a profit and be in legitimate business, you do STILL HAVE TO DO THINGS THE RIGHT WAY. Pay the government their taxes, and know/follow the applicable laws, or you'll not only wind up in some serious shit, but you'll draw the ire of governing bodies and put them right up everyone else's asses as well.

@_date: 2018-03-17 16:28:26
What do you folks think of the possibility that instead of buying Bitcoin, many have now switched to mining to DCA their coins, which has caused exponential growth in hashrate, and those mined coins are replacing what would have been bought previously, thus lowering the volume?
This in mind would have a significant impact on things increasing volume a great deal once the halvening occurs, what are your thoughts?
I only ask because this is exactly what I did. Instead of buying and DCA'ing, I thought I'd start a small mining operation with what I was prepared to lose instead of just buying it outright.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:08:53
Do these morons that make new accounts to dredge up old fud think they're really having a significant impact on anything? 
I suspect they're probably a small part of a large group working on many different sites spreading dissention and uncertainty to try and scare people away from participating. Just continue to isolate them as normal and they seem to delete their accounts quickly.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:11:02
Yeah, I don't mind propping up my mining some to help keep everything decentralized, and I only lose money on the venture if I sell the coins while the price would put me at a loss. People often forget that miners can usually hang on to their coins for a hopeful recovery.

@_date: 2019-05-30 19:14:54
This is the best explanation I can think of:
Let's say fidget spinners are $1.00. You think that fidget spinners will be worth $.80 soon, so you want to try and make some money off of that, so you're going to be shorting them. In this case, you will 'borrow' let's say, 100, with the promise of returning those 100 at or before a pre-determined date. Then you sell those 100 fidget spinners.
That way, if fidget spinners go down to .80 you can buy them back with the money you used from your 100, for $80 instead of $100, pocketing the difference as your profit.
However, it can go the other way. What if after you sell your 100 fidget spinners the price goes to $1.05, or even $1.10? What if it keeps going up? You need to set a point where you'd have an acceptable loss where you buy back your 100 you'd borrowed before they get too expensive. If you don't, they could in theory go up to $3.00, in which case you would be referred to as 'getting REKT', so you'd set a stop-loss at $1.07 or something like that. When this triggers you get liquidated to my understanding.
Hopefully this is all correct, but I'm sure someone will set me straight if I've used some terminology wrong. Don't short bitcoin!!
**Edit - It's my understanding also that when multiple shorts are setup and get liquidated, this means that many need to quickly go and buy fidget spinners in time before the price goes up. Sometimes if the market has limited supply at the time, it can trigger a sudden spike in prices for fidget spinners as many market participants rush to buy said spinners before it hits unreasonable amounts. Delays here put you into REKTER and REKTEST territory.
