You would receive the same benefits just buying bitcoin as you get your checks 
And you would see none of the risk
Have you considered:
SITUATION: Bitcoin spikes and then drops; if your checks are cut at the wrong time will be paid essentially inflated money. Example you get a 5k check on the 11000 day and then the same day BTC hits below 9k. You’re now out about 20 percent just for your work paying you at the wrong time. 
Over the long run the investment is the same amount but being paid in bitcoin if you have to pay your bills at the time of a downtrend you will be throwing money away. 
SITUATION: You earn 1 bitcoin your rent is worth .3 bitcoin. 
Bitcoin drops 20 percent and you need to pay this bill. You pay it. Bitcoin goes back up. You have effectively massively overpaid for a contractually fixed cost. 
Pay your bills then invest. The money you lose on on a few transaction costs is way less than money you lose having to pull investment money out early to pay bills. Think of all the idiots who have bought coffee or pizza (or w/e) with bitcoin early on. These stories are everywhere. Your landlord will be driving a Lamborghini in the rent money u paid him because you had to pull in a dip.

Did you come up with this yourself or did the captain help you?

Great layman’s explanation while also highlighting the clear failures in the current system! Love it.

Also, thought you deserved more laughs with the 900 dollars comment. Haha i was waiting for it to be like a 40k deposit from your wallet that froze it. Nope. Just 900 bucks, clearly a matter for the police.

Then you realize your low stop loss order executed and you are now out at a loss and the price is far higher than your limit.

Ah gotcha. Good

Just found 100 bucks owed to my uncle. Love it! Nothing like skimming the inter webs for misappropriated funds at 1 am.  XD
@_date: 2019-03-01 05:08:56
But as soon as you get it back... put it in bitcoin!!! XD

My cat had a procedure a while back I had the vet insert a small sd data card with my coin on it into the membrane. Cat has to die or be killed to sell. 
I’m kidding but seriously what’s the craziest spot someone could put coin?

Gotta save the fossil fuels for mining power consumption

You’re high. Solar tech is a very slow steady trickle of electricity. The technology is nowhere close to generating the amount of kilowatt hours required for even the simplest cost efficient mining rig. 
Look at the documentary on mining operations in China. They are the big players but they quote 80,000 dollar monthly electric bills. Solar is so far away from this capacity. 
Cost of mining is a huge concern above poster is correct reward will also scale but there are mining operations burning as much electricity as the state of Rhode Island. Solar will never support these needs.

Tom! Who could split their bitcoin seven times? That many bitcoin horcruxes would destroy the soul. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:25:19
Good point. Should have a microchip and kill switch installed too. This poor cat 
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:33:09
Definitely. Are most crypto ATM super inflated like this one? First one I’ve come across. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:33:42
Yeah man Crabtree!

Not if you trade on an exchange like the GDAX through coinbase. As a market maker if you place limit orders then there are zero fees.

Trump probably owns more BTC than all of us.

So much hell yes in this entire thread.
