this is not a class. this is an outline for a book. The fact you don't go into the crypto seems like a glaring omission

The article mentioned the court itself (ie, the judge) said that it is not an expert and admit the law is hazy on the treatment of virtual currencies, and would not want to rule on the validity of the claims. Even if the court rule bitcoin has value (and they didn't say it didn't have value), the laws are written in such a way that they can't be properly applied, so basically, given how the law is written and the evidence presented to the court, there's not enough to convict the defendant. 
I don't see anything wrong with this argument, even if the court didn't fully understand the bitcoin concept. One can speculate that the prosecutor didn't fully explain bitcoin to the judge properly, but that's their own fault for not doing so, so they can't appeal on their own failed case.
Prosecutor's appeal would have basically claim that the law wasn't applied properly or that the judge has some prejudice for an appeal, and I just don't see that here. 
There's no way the prosecutor will go bring a new trial because of double-jeapordy laws, so I think this is the end of this case.

whom should appeal? the prosecutor? on what grounds?
