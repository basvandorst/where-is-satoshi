Im there every now and then. Dunno why. I got into dogecoin when it first came out because it caught my eye. Don't own any though, I give them away as I get them.
They temporarily removed the voting buttons for non subscribers. Shady.
Most of their 'big donations' were really like 80% an investor and 20% the community. Shady.
Also, no one talks about the very real fact that doge wont be worth mining in 2015. The block reward drops to some super tiny number. No miners no security.
And about taking dogecoin serious... I dont really think that it matters what they do. Bitcoin is on the frontlines. Bitcoin deals with the press. Bitcoin deals with the regulators. Bitcoin deals with the hackers. If dogecoin wants to be taken more seriously all it has to do is wait for bitcoin to break new ground first. Dogecoin is hiding in the shadows comfortably. They dont have any real adversity.

To my eyes is full of propoganda. 
looks like they finally broke 70k subs which is cool but before that there were threads upvoted to the front page every day begging people to 'subshibe'. Very shady stuff goes on over there.  Some of the same posts get to the front page daily with doge pictures and whatnot. I think its ghost accounts and botted upvotes.
I don't even have anything against dogecoin, or doge the meme etc. There is just something off about that place and that community. 
At least when im here in i know what I am getting into and no one tries to diguise it.

What are you talking about man, they didnt sell any coins , they are trying to avoid getting taxed out the ass.

Call me crazy but I feel like any money put into  BTC will appreciate moreso than DOGE
we will see in 1 years time. Wont take long to know.
I could be wrong and I dont mind either outcome. theres enough growth room for many cryptos.
