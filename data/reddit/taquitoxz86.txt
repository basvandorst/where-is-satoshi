well i am looking for notification for the price difference, not the actual price itself. Cant seem to find any option in that app that can do the calculation and alert me.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:39:07
do you have to pay any fees?
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:42:02
wow i guess its much better than coinbase then..thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:20:18
oh wow, so I cant just "remove address from wallet" in electrum for ledger? If i only plan to use electrum for ledger forever..
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:35:25
Well  I actually want to create a simple bot that compares the best bid price in Quoinex with the best ask price in Gemini, if the price difference is above a certain amount, I will sell in Quoinex and buy in Gemini..
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:34:48
Thanks. I want to create a simple bot that compares the best bid price in Quoinex with the best ask price in Gemini, if the price difference is above a certain amount, I will sell in Quoinex and buy in Gemini..do you think if it is possible using NodeJS?

How about FIAT withdrawals ? Do they transfer to Singapore banks?
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:47:20
i heard something like you need to get the witness address and witness private key from redeem script etc..
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:21:51
is gemini withdrawal of btc free? no transactions fees to be paid?
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:21:13
i did that and it gave a slider but only in denominations of 10
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:10:09
thanks but even all these seems quite overwhelming to me.. Do you know where can I find help on just the bare basics like :
1)What program to i need to use for typing codes, 2)What other software/tools do I need inorder to connect to the exchanges servers.
Is there a noob proof guide on how to create a bot to just login to both exchanges simultaneously and do nothing. Is it a simple thing to do? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:49
but what happen if an exchange does not support segwit ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:14:27
what i meant is if an exchange says something like "we got hacked and lose xx bitcoins", will fiat deposits still be affected?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:04:18
how do we know that this wallet even contains btc at all ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:36:35
is blockfoilo still working for those who are currently using it?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:16:21
even better if they can send an email alert too 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:38:26
can someone ELI5 on this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:11:07
i dont want the next block i just want it to be confirm even if it takes 2 weeks..which is lowest fee i can choose?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:12
how do i interpret this chart ? is 60-70 sat/byte the best way to confirm ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:38:37
As a financial advisor, where is the best place to park your funds after cashing out?
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:04:33
I am looking for a chart that shows price difference between Gemini &amp; Quoine but sadly hard to find Quoine graphs..
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:03:12
support is at 7.4k not 8.5k lol, don't make ppl lose more money
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:43:04
can you send coins from a segwit address to a legacy address and pay lesser fees?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:45:43
is there any other way to make it drop out without resending?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:06:50
will it be possible for someone to resend another transaction with higher fees to some other address if I am hacked?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:20:01
if it is so easy to generate perfect words within short period of time (5years), wouldn't it be also easy to scan and crack our wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:59:14
how can i check if my transaction has been re-broadcasted? does the 2 week dropout period resets if broadcasted again? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:54:19
is the high transaction fees going to hamper the price of bitcoin till a new solution is implemented?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:15:34
wow how does he manage to get "andreas" in his address ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:30:12
I cant do it with electrum..it says insufficient funds because all my coins are still considered as locked up in the mempool..
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:17:54
How can i do CPFP in electrum ? Looked everywhere and couldn't find any settings
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:17:06
blockfolio doesnt auto refresh it's price anymore when I open the app..not sure if it is still working properly
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:46:12
the wallet did not receive any transaction today, why you say that it moved?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:08:23
i accidentally opened the .dat file. Am i infected now?
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:19:06
How about NEO or Cardano?
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:30:54
0.1% interest
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:09:18
not wise to buy while in the middle of dumping process, maybe buy in 6k-7k range later
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:49:57
Will probably dump to a new low bottom before stabilizing. Bullrun is at least 1-3 years away lol
@_date: 2019-11-30 01:09:15
just hold for a few years, we been in declining since 14k and the worst is yet to be over
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:29:53
just sell the coins first before we dump to 6k end of year
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:19:11
he lied and is actually from Qatar lol
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:11:54
but the weekend dump is coming soon though
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:30:17
that 5.34% will most probably be gone by end of this month?
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:40:20
don't forget the big 50% dump in dec 2018 that is coming soon
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:36:23
the real big dip will come soon in Dec just like in 2018!
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:28:32
its a 4 year cycle if you want any solid chance to make money off it, and we might be going back down to 4k again if you got the balls to increase your btc stack
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:33:02
problem is that there are too many moonbois and bulls in markets such as bitmex/bitfinex... whales will keep rekting them until it balances out. we might go back to 4k-6k sooner than you think?
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:09:03
I guess more miners will panic dump in coming weeks, bring us down to 4-6k region?
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:58:08
its been nothing but bearish after china pump, maybe expect it to go 6k by year end?
@_date: 2019-11-05 14:11:51
how many did he bought and at what price?
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:42:10
I thought the Plus token and Cloud token scam leaders have more than 200k btc each? Doesn't it make then top 2?
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:24:38
anyone can write a sob story and then post a btc address for "donation"??
@_date: 2019-11-02 05:38:58
change password for email or bitmex? if bitmex password is unique and different to the rest, still need to change email password?
@_date: 2019-11-03 14:22:05
wow how did you get scammed?
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:34:19
i actually want to verify the key without actually using it if possible
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:20:57
I think that this guy is pretending to be a noob, hoping that someone will give him free coins every time he asked?
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:23:42
what is their explanation for it being a scam?
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:41:28
we will probably revisit 7.4k in days to come
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:53:32
can someone ban this retard mofo scammer?
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:05:17
someone needs to ban this mofo for promoting his scam site
@_date: 2019-10-08 00:12:07
you just jinxed it lol, now dead cat bounce down to 6k in coming days
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:27:09
remember the dec crash from 6k to 3k? we might face a similar 50% crash again soon..
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:13:39
Any idea which software is best for 2) ?
@_date: 2019-10-14 00:37:34
too many moonbois with longs and too little bears with shorts. the whales will just rekt and liquidate the longs for big profits. we going down to 6k soon?
@_date: 2019-10-02 06:46:01
Ask yourself if you are mentally prepared to see it drop to 6k or even 3k again?
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:18:03
never buy during a pump, wait for next big dump to 6-7k region
@_date: 2019-10-23 03:21:30
going to 6k by year end so we can all get it cheap!
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:39:31
remember only the minority will make money in any markets, if there are too many moonbois, the opposite will happen.
@_date: 2019-10-10 00:56:46
looks like a range between 8.7 to 7.7 and not a pump, we going down to 7.7 again next week?
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:20:11
Probably a big dip down to 7-8k then we resume from there
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:51:35
Do you think exchanges that offer OTC was better since you can just deposit your coins in exchange and they will do the rest?
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:10:06
But recession is coming soon? Where to shelter the funds?
@_date: 2019-10-11 00:33:43
bakkt has already bought most of the coins needed at 3k..smart money!
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:00:23
is there any website that rate the best OTC? What if the price suddenly crash after the agreement?
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:22:15
looks like going down to historic 6k support range in coming weeks, then buy at there
@_date: 2019-10-11 00:30:13
last December we dumped from 6k - 3k in the bear market. you decide yourself whether is it bull or bear now
@_date: 2019-10-10 01:00:50
Wait for next big 40-50% dip, do not chase rising prices cus a dump will come out of nowhere
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:52
will it be game over for bitcoin if all banks stop allowing exchanges to convert to fiat ?
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:44:30
nice but where do you store your stablecoin?
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:39:41
i think it needs to go slowly, 20k by 2020 and 40k by 2021
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:51:31
Do you think exchanges that offer OTC was better since you can just deposit your coins in exchange and they will do the rest?
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:43:21
i put the lowest fee in electrum and it says 240sat/byte..
@_date: 2019-12-26 04:36:14
Totally ridiculous that not a single email is being sent out. You need to download their "unofficial" telegram channel to find out. Shitstorm is going on over there and admin is banning anyone that is complaining about this issue.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:55:55
ah thanks. but i see the fees are quite high now. How can I use electrum with segwit to reduce the fees?
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:10:11
lol we gona double up in this bear market by Oct? More like hitting 6k support later on
@_date: 2019-12-05 09:07:37
dude small money is easier to get rid of emotions to trade, when you reach 500k and above profits it's much harder
@_date: 2019-12-21 11:26:58
don't forget plus token, mt gox and many other huge ponzi's are unloading, no smart money will enter until a few years later
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:17:24
plus token is dumping off loads of btc, it's like 3 times bigger than 2018 mt gox sell off
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:46:15
How is this different from any other TA? People can draw whatever curvy lines to fit any  form of graph lol
@_date: 2019-12-11 09:41:26
ugh it's over for bitcoin. mt gox, plus token and now this..gona be dumped to hell!
@_date: 2019-12-14 04:17:49
notice the wicks are at the bottom on the right picture whereas it's the top on the left picture. we are probably going the opposite to 3-4k region soon?
@_date: 2019-12-28 00:35:57
the market is too small to absorb every seller. dont forget plus token still has like 3 times the amount of btc that mt gox dumped in 2018 for dumping.
@_date: 2019-12-28 00:46:20
wtf lol 200k gains per year until 2021. how crazy moonbois can be these days!
@_date: 2019-12-01 02:59:22
we going down to 6k bois, weekend dump is here!
@_date: 2019-12-14 01:11:57
all these idiots will cause us to dump back down to 3k
@_date: 2019-12-17 05:49:38
I guess smart money has taken profits and is gone, left degen gamblers hoping to get quick rich?
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:57:01
this useless article will just disappear like the rest when we hit a new low bottom again
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:43:07
this kind of sudden pumps without news might be a bull trap though
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:27:24
thanks but how do i actually read that graph ? as long i pay a fee above the horizontal blue line, my transaction will not get stuck for weeks?
@_date: 2019-01-17 01:09:18
buy at around 750-1k not now unless you're mentally strong enough to ride the roller coaster
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:49:48
does it mean everyone have to change their seeds before 1.4?
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:19:11
Wait until the 1.2k to 2.5k range then you buy it, and maybe a flash crash below 1k, then you hodl till the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:59:00
ah ok thanks anyway electrum minimum when i click "edit fees manually" is 5sats/byte. You cant go lower than that. And it even says "low fee" after i send it..
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:43:51
any replies from either company so far?
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:17:11
you mean connecting to the internet while on tails? or the website releasing new version of tails to download and mount on?
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:21:32
wouldnt connecting to the internet expose me to virus/malware etc ? or is it safe doing it in tails ?
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:33:57
ahh thanks but if i put 5sat/byte and suddenly a flood of 200sats/byte choke the mempool, it is possible that my tx will get stuck for weeks until dropout right?
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:08:47
is there really a way to transfer our fiat into exchanges without going through middleman like banks ? and our fiat has to come out from a bank anyway..
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:31:46
but where can others view your message ? do they just have to go to your public address in any blockchain website ?
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:20:14
if a private key has all the letters/numbers but is all jumbled up, how long does it take to rearrange them ?
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:23:42
thanks so the final destination is the mempool of a mining pool node?
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:26:12
ok cool thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:56:35
if i import a private key into electrum and it shows the correct bitcoin address that I am planning to put my bitcoin into, does it counted as a successful test, without having to transfer small coins ?
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:00:12
we gona hit 8.5k by 27 (cme settlement) and might go as low as 6k
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:04:54
you knew btc since $20 and you fall for that?!
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:31:35
if you forget the passcode the bitcoins will be lost forever ?
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:20:42
is the latest version of electrum included ? if not how to get it if offline?
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:40:14
does it mean in future the blockchain will be choked if thousands of companies spam ads?
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:35:10
what does the "count" column mean?
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:30:25
i thought it is not good to reuse addr even once ??
@_date: 2019-05-06 10:54:12
Get in at 2-2.5k i think
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:57:09
you mean electrum is included in all TailOS iso? Can I verify keys too?
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:48:52
i mean i generated some private keys some time ago and i wanted to check if they are legit before i use them. can electrum verify them ? thanks
