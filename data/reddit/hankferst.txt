They do but it is a bit funky. On the first deposit to my account it lists coinbase and an 800 number. I tried calling it and gives you a few prompts 1 for fraud and 2 for other. If you hit 2 it tells you to head to the website then clicks off. If you hit 1 it asks you to leave name and number and they will get  back to you.

Wasn't trying to publicly shame anyone. They didn't respond to any request for support for two days: Case file, live chat, twitter customer support, community forum. So I took it to the streets.
They get 1% of all of my transactions so that $58 dollars they earned from me receiving money into my account should at least be enough to give me a friggin response that hey we are working on it.
The end result is that it was a problem on their end and not anything that I did. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have noticed it until I decided that my $2490 dollars was a much bigger priority to me then it was to them and took action.
They reacted when someone probably brought attention to this thread and acted on the situation like they should have in the first place.
This community helped me out and you are right this does damage Coinbase because something as simple as an email to me could have avoided 810 other people upvoting this and thousands more reading this.
It's embarrassing for them as a company that it had to come to this but value your customers, treat them right and this could have been avoided.

And what national holiday would that be? Every bank is open here in the states. Coinbase is based in SF. Don't see this as an issue.
Edit: Realize this made me sound sort of like a dick. Apologize for that. I even googled national holiday and didnt have this or Easter listed. The stock market is closed but my post office and banks are open.

Thanks. I really wasn't aware of this.
Did get an e-mail from Coinbase problem was on their side. Everything is in my account now.

I could surely use an extra 2.4 million so I wish it was that as well :)

Well I did get a BMO Harris deposit for the first transaction. 
Support at Coinbase hasn't replied to me at all. What concerns me is that I never got an e-mail from them saying a withdraw had be initiated like the other two.
The first and third payments I got exactly on time.
Today would be day four for the second payment. I'd just like to know that they are aware of the problem and working with me to get it taken care. I also did see that on the 21st they were down. I'm wondering if that 10pm request just never got batched in and its sitting in some space between.

I have no agenda. Just a dude looking to get my money. They took care of it. So life is good. Enjoy your weekend.

Yeah it's nerve wracking not hearing back from someone for a couple of days especially when their business is centered around user transactions. I'm glad it got taken care of but yeah that gap between responses was not fun.

The bible has a belt? Does it wear pants?
Sorry work Fridays brings out the idiot in me. It's so close to the weekend.
But you are right. I'm near Chicago so not that close to the belt.

Not really. I'm still going to use Coinbase. I think it is the best platform here in the states to get money and make bitcoin purchases. In this case their customer service was lacking.
My issue is that we really shouldn't be calling them a startup anymore. They've been around a while. They boast having 2 million customers. They should have appropriate customer service to service us.

As a follow up to this. I placed my first order since this whole debacle and it was immediately cancelled. Contacted support about it. They responded that I needed to be verified. I am verified with my id's. 18 hours later no response via e-mail. I'm moving on from Coinbase.

He's not using soil. Do the research on vertical farms and you will see what he is doing. Most of these systems use a ton of water you are right but the water drips off the roots, goes back through the filtration system and is reused some as efficiently as 95%. It's a pretty amazing thing
