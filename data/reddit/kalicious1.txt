Problems like this one? Months after Bitfloors unceremonious closure, (it happened overnight with no warning) Bitfloor and owner Roman Shtylman have been very unresponsive to the public, to the people he still owes money too. A lot of money....
It is hard to estimate how much is owed, but it is speculated between .5 - 1 million dollars (or more)
If you are owed money by Roman Shtylman and Bitfloor please join us on reddit to discuss the situation and pending class action lawsuit.
The group is called Bitfloored

why no facebook group to connect people? why no website to shame Roman, the owner. The more heat he feels the more likely we are to get movement on this

people who are owed BTC by bitfloor please join us here.
There is a class action lawsuit forming, and we are discussing other possibilities for moving this case forward.

To all of you still owed money by Roman Shtylman and Bitfloor
Please write to or call his lawyer
With a little heat, I am sure we can at least get Roman to make a statement about what he intends to do. Right now, he is behaving like a crook, plain and simple.

Is every new BTC issued only to miners? 
Meaning, are only those people who are mining BTC revealing new "coins", and does every new coin revealed go to pay miners?
I just wonder about this.
If miners are essentially making BTC out of thin air (yes i know, owning and running a computer is a task)
and all new BTC's go to only the miners
Isnt is sort of a flawed system? Why would people agree that giving them their hard earned USD to buy into BTC? When miners are able to just get rich sitting at home on their ass?
