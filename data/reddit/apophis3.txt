Chances are, *if* he actually got those coins the *shady* way ... **cough**finex**cough** he will have a problem getting any of them soon without a lot of attention. Spreading them to hundreds or even thousands of innocent users and hiding himself amongst them is a smart way to do it. And if he has enough coins, like lets say 120k, then he would not really mind wasting 1k on that... Just my 2 cents...

That support team is not worth shit. Sorry, but i recently had a problem with not receiving the authorization email to login to my account - and the best thing your support had to tell me, was "what happens whe you try it with this link" - giving me the same link i stated was not working for me. And then, 2 replies later, the *same* support-person gives me the *exact* same advice again. Finally he tells me to try to reset 2factor auth - which i haven't even setup. I did that, but haven't heard anything for 2 days now. I basically gave up on my blockchain.info account by now (even though i have wallet id, password and mnemonic).
Thank god i don't have any bitcoins in there anymore, i would be really screwed then.
Best advice so far: use a wallet stored on your computer! If you screw something up, you can only blame yourself and not some incompetent support people...
