Maidsafes SAFE network is so much more then decentralized dropbox ( thats Storj).
First Maidsafe doesn't use blockchain technique and thanks to that you'll be able to send safecoin instantly, free, anonymous. Next to the safecoin aspect it's a fully anonymous, autonomous, decentralized network. Every app that can be build on the 'normal' internet can be build on the SAFE network. You can find more

(Maid)Safecoins advantages: 
Maidsafe's crypto currency is actually anonymous, not like Bitcoin. There is no global ledger in the safe network that tracks transactions like with blockchain technology, each safecoin holds a current owner and previous owner and nothing more. The transaction from owner to the new owner is instant and doesn't need confirmations.

The goal is to replace the fiat and knowing that fiat money is centralized, a decentralized exchange will never use fiat. In the months after the launch of the decentralized exchange, you'll be able to create user currencies like usdcoin, gold coin etc. So it won't be able to use the fiat currencies but you can extract the volatility of fiat currencies or gold.

Servers are gone, no trusted authority.
some quotes:
User Defined data" of a ***Coin can hold a file/directory (no blockchain bloat issues cos ***Coin confess with its own storage, accessible to everyone, free, all the time - nothing to pre-download as in bitcoin-QT
***Coin can be used for anything, such as bets, shares, trades, smart contracts etc." ----&gt; ***coin is bitcoin/Ethereum on steroids! 
**Secure** 
(***coin is at least as secure as bitcoin. For example, the famous bitcoin "51% attack", would require at least 75%, and even then have only limited vulnerability.)
**Truly Anonymous**
(No blockchain - only anonymous ids are recorded, and only the current and immediately preceding owners ids are retained.)
Massively Scalable (Instant transactions regardless of transaction volume - no blockchain bottleneck.)
**Accessible** 
(Anyone with a computing device can obtain ***coin simply by joining the network and "mining" by sharing bandwidth and disk space with the network, whereas this was only feasible with bitcoin during the early days and now a small number specialised "miners" earn almost all the bitcoin available. On *** network, "mining" capability will remain much more evenly distributed even as the network matures and "mining" rates 
Maybe by reading these words you already know which cryptocurrency I'm talking about ?

WOW, the more I read about it the more I see it becoming one of the few killer apps for Bitcoin. Next to safecoin (Zero fees, immediate transactions, totally anonymous and more!), you can store your Bitcoins safe into SAFE(Safe Access For Everyone). No more messing around with all kind of backups, seeds, paper wallets because the network does all that itself.

because Ripple is centralized and blockchain needs every node to know the data of every other node. With Maidsafes technology only the closest nodes of each nodes need to know. This means instant transactions of safecoin and other data too.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:42:18

Care to explain why promoting Storj instead of Maidsafe ? Serious question :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:04:02
You might need to know more about Maidsafe to understand this explanation but maybe it's enough: 
'' The SAFE Network requires all requests be processed by at least two groups of Vaults.
A MaidSafe client passes a request to its 4 Data managers, who verify the request based on the client’s signature. The request is then passed to a deterministically selected group of 4 other Vaults which also verify the request based on its signature.
By deterministically selecting the second group of Data managers, this attack no longer holds true for the SAFE Network, since it is not possible for the attacker to gain control over a Vault by simply surrounding it.
To circumvent this, the attacker would require the ability to surround speciﬁc Vaults in the SAFE Network. This cannot be achieved, as it would require being able to effectively generate different values which, when hashed with SHA-512, result in close hashes around one particular point.''
Their consensus mechanism  is explained here:
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:53:22
I don't see where this comparison comes from, I tried to help you understand and I think you can find the answer in my reply.
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:07:15
Well I think there will be a competitor in the form of Maidsafe and their Safecoin. When they launch in Q1 of this year, safecoin transactions won't have fees, the transactions are instant and anonymous. 
The reason this is the first competitor is because the altcoins right now are using blockchain technology. While this technology is groundbreaking it doesn't serve the users as it should. The blockchain is an open ledger and I can't understand why everybody should see and know about my transactions? Please explain me why if you can.
Maidsafe has developed it's own technology where only the 4 closest nodes around a user will have to know about his transaction. So not the entire miners network which takes at least ten minutes to confirm but only four others. This is a simple explanation but more can of course be found on their website.
As we've seen with right now already tenths of thefts in the bitcoin space, Bitcoin seems to be born in the wrong body. Such a good concept in a space where scammers and thieves can go their own way and people who have stolen around half a billion dollar worth of Bitcoin are still walking around drinking frapuccinos. 
That's why I think the cryptocurrencies need a world that offers protection from the bottom and the project I'm talking about does that by creating a fully decentralized network.

The gaps occur because CME isn't trading 24/7, so at a certain point in the day the market closes and trading stops. Meanwhile bitcoin keeps trading on exchanges and thus can go higher of lower in the time that CME is closed. If the CME opens again, it will trade at the same price as the bitcoin exchanges and this creates a gap between the closing price of the CME and the opening price.

Why do companies and miners have to make compromises/technical development decisions in the first place?


Why would they implement a hardfork that hasn't got any consensus besides the NYA signers?


No they call it a takeover because it is being done with force and without consensus. I seriously can't think of a reason to do a hardfork for technical reasons right now, except for the business having made an agreement, which I don't care about.

How does being untested, avoiding blockchain technology and custom coins make them inferior? That's only true if you're talking at this moment but that's an unfair comparison. Bitcoin has got the advantage over existing  and thereby testing for more than 6 years now but looking at the technology Maidsafe is developing I almost dare to say that their technology might even be more useful and safe than a blockchain (scaling problems, anonymity problems, speed problems when doing different stuff than a simple transaction).
