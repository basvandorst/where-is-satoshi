What's the deal with the ones that aren't connected? Does that mean they are online but no payment channels open?
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:07:02
How does the bot work? Does it just do small trades as the price bops up and down?

I came here to hodl and chew bubble gum, and I’m all out of bubble gum.

Tell her that if she waits until 40k you’ll take her you double Japan and marry her twice.

Then what is your stablehand doing?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:51:41
Cool. Then I'll get myself another Blockachino! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:47:08
It was also on the front of City AM. I think they only distribute that appear in London though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:44:44
Works great. Does using this actually help the devs or is it purely a gimmick/demo?

So, the Starbucks thing - is it that they *will* start accepting crypto payments, or that they are implementing a system that means they *can*? And is it BTC or potentially other coins as well? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:04:52
If tons of BTC gets locked up in ETFs wont that make it less viable as a currency because of smaller circulating supply? Which would in turn deplete value and defeat the point of the ETF?

The Genesis Block sounds like a thing you’d find in Odin’s vault. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:17:16
I’m listening. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:23:13
I’ll go $6,970 
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:59:44
Thanks, this looks useful. 
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:57:43
Could sell for a large % profit but I have such a small amount it’s not worth it. Would rather wait it out and bet on it increasing a lot over the next 5 years.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:18:20
For once this is happening when I have some fiat so this is good for me.
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:23:01
You ..... bastard! 
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:50:11
I wonder if they’ll block payments to the alternative investments market or gambling websites? Oh wait, of course they won’t.
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:01:47
I like Enjin wallet. I’ve had to restore it from seed several times and never had a problem. You can set fees for transfers. Holds lots of currencies.
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:26:34
Use the same login details as for Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:34:30
Different networks, different technologies. But they can all interact via exchanges.
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:46:42
Anyone know if Bluewallet is allowing withdrawal yet?
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:13:31
If you have a legitimate grievance they’ll send you the same amount of bitcoin back. You don’t have to literally reverse the transaction to make a refund.

Since I’m sure I’ll be seeing him again soon, how do I pronounce Vegeta? Is it Vay-Garta? Vee-Jeeta?
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:36:14
What made you decide to sell?
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:48:31
No but I’d set a stop loss if I were you.
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:39:56
I was also going to post this but I thought it was just that each attack did 7777 damage, didn’t know it was 64 of them. Only saw it once ever I think.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:04:08
**You seem to know what you’re talking about. Can I ask your opinion on something - what do you think will be the effect of all the crypto futures/funds that the conventional financial institutions are setting up? Seems logical that the influx of money will both push up the value and make it more stable, but I’m not very clever or wise. I realise no one can really answer this question, but I’d like to hear your opinion.**
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:06:53
Lucky sevens! All your attacks will do 9999 damage. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:55:45
I’m sure you’re right. Easy was the wrong word, ‘simple’ is probably better. Still easy to lose money if you panic and don’t stick to your plan. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:58:49
It’s the button labelled ‘Margin Trading’
*not actual advice*
@_date: 2019-02-27 12:01:29
Does this actually benefit these nations at all? Or is it just a gauge of interest? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:38:35
London Block Exchange is a very good name. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:51:11
Binance launching margins on Tuesday so we could see another spike then.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:41:42
I was looking at bisq but it looked complicated. What are the fees like?
@_date: 2019-02-28 08:29:56
It's easy to make money when it moves back and forth within a range. Just buy 3500 sell 4000 for example. Build that stack and when the next bull-run happens you'll have more assets. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:00:35
Oh I got that you were joking I was just wondering if there was a particular thing that made you sell yesterday instead of a week ago or a week from now. But a hunch is good enough for me. Thanks Professor Moneybags!
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:39:50
I feel that the wall is quite ugly. It also looks fake. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:33:32
I would set stop losses on the way up to sell maybe half if it dipped back to 18k 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:42:12
Some branches of CEX have bitcoin ATMs too. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:43:33
Should have clarified - to a non-lightning address

Why is he pretending to be Satoshi? What’s his game here?
@_date: 2019-04-21 10:02:44
That’s true but what we’re talking about here is basically looking after your cash, not securing your data against an intrusive government. 
If someone wants to steal your phone or the crypto on your phone they are more likely to watch you put your pin in, then steal it than they are to physically force you to unlock it with your fingerprint. 
In general though it’s a good point about data protection/privacy.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:45:39
I think it will be interesting in ten years when there are documentaries about the scams &amp; manipulation that went on. 
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:06:39
If you have a lot then a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S
If you don’t have a lot then a wallet on your phone that uses fingerprint ID.

Everyone is selling in preparation to buy Easter eggs next month. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:13:58
Is it truly noob friendly? I have a pi not doing anything in my cupboard but I’m stupid with computers. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:55:52
Sorry for being stupid but what’s wrong with this? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:40:13
Yeah but if it goes up 1000% you could get dinner for two at an inexpensive restaurant. Imagine that!  
@_date: 2019-01-26 08:31:22
You search the dead Kobold. He has a rusty dagger and some BCH so you leave it and go about your day. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:47:46
Do you pay a fee to the bank to have an account though? I have free transactions but there is a monthly account fee. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:20:21
Are they still hodling? 
@_date: 2019-01-21 09:01:40
Does anyone know if there’s a Discord for BlueWallet or generally for lightning stuff? 
@_date: 2019-01-13 21:02:36
I accept Bitcoin on my side-job but none of my clients choose to pay with it. One day...... 
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:28:55
Who here actually buys things with Crypto? And what do you buy?
I first got some BTC because I thought it sounded interesting and I used it to buy Huel. They stopped accepting it and I don’t think I’ve used it for a purchase since. 
I’m going to try out purse.io but right now I don’t need anything off Amazon and I have some vouchers to use up. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:44:46
He looks up from his phone to see a Kobold brandishing a wooden club. Roll for initiative. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:43:21
Since everyone likes guessing what is going to happen, my prediction for 2019 is that we'll increase gradually through the year with a high of $6300. Low will be about $3200 when the ETF is rejected. 
Not really basing that on anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:32:05
Unless you live in Greece or Zimbabwe or a hundred other places. Then you’re better off with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:14:30
I have no idea what I’m talking about but I’m going to predict it stays above 8700. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:22:43
Brilliant, that completely clears it up. So the problem everyone has with Coinbase must be the exchange, not the wallet. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:27:29
It was actually 2 pizzas, so it's not nearly as bad. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:23:37
Thanks. So it is basically what I said, you put BTC into custodial wallet and it sells as needed to cover your purchase. I assume transactions are instant at point of sale though? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:41:18
It’s a thing you say when your comment is too short and you need to beef it up a bit. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 07:12:09
It’s alive!
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:40:49
Rare to hear someone being so honest. Have an updoot.

Come to London, you can get a mid sized shed with that money.
