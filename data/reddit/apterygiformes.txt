@_date: 2014-05-06 13:02:17
Still, it's rude to call Islam "gross"
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:36:29
What's wrong with Islam? It is a religion of peace
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:14:16
So you want bitcoin to be completely separate from the government but when everything goes to shit you want the government to be there ready to help?
@_date: 2014-03-18 11:59:21

I recommend localbitcoins.com . Also there's a british bitcoin subreddit at @_date: 2014-03-09 13:52:35
This isn't actually news!
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:18:58

Not really worth the effort on Valve's part
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:42:56
I don't get how you can all reason that bitcoin should be taken seriously and used as a proper global currency, yet when this happens to some unsuspecting couple with bitcoins in the wrong place, it's somehow the couple's fault.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:21:00
Yeah but money is safe in a bank
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:27:37
I apologize. I have done a lot of research on Bitcoin but I have not kept up recently on the rising price of Bitcoin. I thought people here may have a better insight of what is going to happen to it. 
Sorry for spamming the subreddit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:52:22
Seriously, they're making it look like bitcoin is a currency for super-villains
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:07:15
One weird trick! Bitcoin miners hate her!
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:11:17
