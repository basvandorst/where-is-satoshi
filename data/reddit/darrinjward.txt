I thought it would be interesting for some to compare the paper writing style to that of the bitcoin.pdf

First thing I thought was... FAKE - they didn't have color photography all the way back then!

I never got deep into BTC (don't own any), but as an outside observer, I definitely tend to agree with this. IF this character turns out to be Satoshi returning, I would be disinclined to touch BTC. I just don't trust this person, given his questionable moral fiber and judgement as a person, given these developments; And given he holds such a large position in BTC - how could you take a stake in BTC not knowing what erratic behavior is to follow.
Makes you think though... Perhaps this guy holds a BTC short position in some way and specifically wants to create a exodus from the BTC system by injecting uncertainty and chaos. Cover; Profit; Pay back taxes.

Another one I found is wrightfoundation.micorbis.com
Cache: 
There's nothing super exciting here but maybe the post titles as determined by the URL's will be interesting to someone, e.g:
"Favourite Colour"
"Of Monsters &amp; Men"
"Flower &amp; Decorations"
"Fragments of Iceland" (Doesn't he allegedly have a supercomputer here?)
"My Trip to New York"
"Brunch with Friends"
But then again, may not be of interest to anyone :)

One has to wonder if some of these other authors contributed to Bitcoin.
