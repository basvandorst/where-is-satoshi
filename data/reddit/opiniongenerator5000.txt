@_date: 2018-01-03 01:28:14

most people ITT are wrong
your cost/basis of the orignal BTC is now split between BTC and BCH. example: 
* you have 1 BTC as of 7/1/17. You paid $3990 for the BTC and a $10 purchase fee. Your tax basis in the BTC is $4k
* fork happens on 8/1/17. At 8/1/17, BTC is trading for $4500 and BCH is trading for $500. 
* your cost basis in BTC is now [(4500/5000)x4000] = $3600. your cost basis in BCH is [(500/5000)x4000] = $400. In other words, of your $4,000 investment, 90% is allocated to BTC and 10% is allocated to BCH. 
* when you sell your BCH for $500, you have a $100 taxable gain

i dont think anyone is denying it's in a bubble. the more accurate question is how high will it go? it could go to $100,000 or crash in 1 hour. 
the price was $5,500 less than a month ago. anything is possible.

If digitizing your assets creates a capital gain, it should be a taxable event

Financial advisors manage risk. I can make better than 10% at a casino but I can still be stupid for trying

just wait. FOMO and FUD are both emotions you shouldn't let control your investments.

the ethereum network is undeniably outperforming the bitcoin network.

Honestly, don't donate money to anyone you only know from cyberspace. I'm sure you can find a worthy recipient in real life.

i think everyone who bought around $5k is going to hodl until the sun explodes, but everyone who bought after has relatively weak hands. we are NOT in the phase of early adoption. 
disclaimer before i'm accused: i'm not trying to spread FUD. i have no idea whats going to happen to bitcoin. think for yourself, make a decision and live with it. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:42:07
of course?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:51:38
why the fuck would you let that into your house? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:40
you can't blame people for not knowing the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:35:29
he seems to support both currencies, which is okay
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:38:32
Fud = fear uncertainty doubt. 
Honestly, things have become pretty tribal between BTC and BCH. It's hard to tell good analysis from propaganda, and I would advise believing everything said by both sides. Your best bet is trying to understand it for yourself and making your own decision.

20% in a few days.. nice! 
Edit: 25% &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:40:39
glad to see i'm not the only one who does this haha
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:27:26
sadly, it's backed by oil and military might

Communicate through quantum entanglement. It's really easy.

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:46:15
why do you believe that? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:34:17
thanks for answer!
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:23:22
i didn't predict it first, but i predicted it best
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:26:18
i stand fully corrected. thats a good story
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:34:52


i don't know who will win, but without a doubt governments favor central banks
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:56:44
lol no. 
do you actually believe 100k EOY will happen? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:36:13
i think it will change the nature of the procedures. the article mentions how lawyers will need to know programming in order to interpret smart contracts for their clients. auditors will most likely need to understand code as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:27:03
if i were to bet on any horse in this thread, id say this one is closest. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:34:01
whether or not he's right about government power and capability, he's definitely right about their intentions. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:58:32
no doubt a lot of financial industries will change, but auditing is already largely automated. most of the time, the point of an auditor is to provide a human element to ensure the controls are functioning properly, and make adjustments that only a human (or theoretical AI) would know to make. i cannot foresee blockchain disrupting auditing any time soon; in our lifetime it may increase the need for auditors. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:32:05
this guy knows
almost every military action from gadaffi's removal to the american revolution was fought over control over the money supply. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:28:55


you would? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:19:07
you guys always say you guys but it's never all the guys. why do you guys say you guys every time? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:33:49
there's so many comments stating $100,000. who the fuck actually believes it will 10x again this year? it wont. we might not even see a new ATH this year. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:28:19
how is that possible? when did you buy in?
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:30:49
