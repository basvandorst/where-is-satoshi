There is an obvious reason. You ought to use Bitcoin because you are thereby encouraging its further use &amp; wider adoption.
If it goes mainstream the price of bitcoin will go up considerably given its scarcity.
Any bitcoins you buy now could be worth a great deal more when that happens.
That's a compelling reason.

I'm a keen supporter of Bitcoin, but I find the writer's assertion in the first paragraph of his introduction that Bitcoin is not a financial product or service, and his use of publishing metaphors rather than financial ones, rather disingenuous.
Bitcoin is certainly far more than merely a means of transferring value.  But it is certainly not less than that.

Don't put more into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose. There are no guarantees of what will happen.
However, if Bitcoin does succeed, the potential payback for those who bought some now could be very large indeed.
Comparing the risk to the potential benefit, I'd say you should do it, as long as the amount you put in is one you can afford to take a risk with.

Please explain how "Goats, Pogs, Matabele Gumbo Beads" use cryptography to create and maintain a decentralised ledger that verifies ownership. Oh, that's right, they can't and don't.
Bitcoin does, which is why it has value and your comparison is ignorant.
You also don't understand basic maths or economics. Scarcity of bitcoin means there will only ever be just under 21 million bitcoins in existence. Wider adoption means more &amp; more people using bitcoin. 
Bitcoins are divisible into very small units, the smallest being a satoshi, or 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin. The fact that bitcoin has scarcity doesn't mean everyone on the planet couldn't be using bitcoin. It just means the pie would be divided up into much smaller pieces in order to go around.

You asserted that 'what we can say with certainty is that it [Bitcoin] is *not a financial product or service*' (your emphasis).
That's just plain wrong. You can't expect NYDFS to take you seriously with an assertion like that.
Yes, Bitcoin is so much more than a mere financial product or service. But it cannot function in any of those other ways without fundamentally being a financial product and service. You assert that it simply isn't one. That doesn't make sense.

Your comment is one of the few sane ones I've read in this thread.
Run an enterprise like Silk Road and attempt to hire hitmen to eliminate any threats to your operation and you deserve life in prison.
I'm a big supporter of Bitcoin but disappointed though not surprised that so many other bitcoiners can't think straight on the Silk Road issues.

Soon to become 595,784 Tesco employees
I contacted Tesco a while back and asked if they had thought about accepting Bitcoin.  They should have done so, I reckon 99% of UK bitcoiners would switch to whatever UK chain first accepts BTC, and buy everything they can there.  I know I would.
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:18:25
I find the same. Whenever I spend bitcoin at a bricks and mortar store (in the UK), and ask about bitcoin usage, it's either 'you're the first' or it's 'we rarely get anyone asking to pay with bitcoin'.
Widespread bricks and mortar adoption could well come, but I reckon at the tail end of bitcoin going mega. There are other uses it will likely dominate first.
Despite the wide publicity bitcoin has now had, and the opportunity for many people to start buying it if they wanted to, there are relatively few who have bothered to do so. 
That just means we're still at the stage where it's a great buying opportunity.


Don't worry about it. The genuine utility of Bitcoin has nothing to do with speculation.  The usefulness of Bitcoin in many areas will still exist even if the price was one dollar = one bitcoin, and when people eventually catch on to Bitcoin's utility the price is likely to rocket given limited supply.
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:46:23
I didn't write that the price wouldn't be altered.  I wrote that the price drop would be temporary, because estimates of what one bitcoin could be worth are correctly based upon the value of the markets it could move into, e.g. forex, divided by max of 21 million coins, which is correct.
@_date: 2015-08-29 18:51:00
My preference is to use a Trezor. Of course you've got to first transfer your coins to the Trezor's accounts, and that means potentially exposing the private keys if you use a compromised machine.  But once the funds are 'in' the Trezor, they are safe.  You don't need to worry about the Trezor 'breaking'.  Just make sure you have several copies of the master seed in safe places. You can always recover the funds in a Trezor if you have the master seed.

The price drop would be temporary.  It's not true that Satoshi's coins "are generally going to be discounted in any economic formula of the effective supply of BTC".  Satoshi's coins are part of the max. 21 million that can ever exist.  The attempts to arrive at a price for bitcoin if mainstream adoption happens take into account that there can only ever be just under 21 million bitcoins in existence. So Satoshi's coins, whether they move or don't, are factored in to the attempt to arrive at a price upon mainstream adoption.

Temporarily. Any large stash of coins suddenly being sold is going to move the price down in the short term. But only in the short term.
Satoshi's unmoved coins are part of the maximum 21 million that can ever exist.  So they are already priced in to estimates of what a single bitcoin could be worth if Bitcoin goes mainstream.

So, what are you creating your paper wallets on? A computer that you literally built yourself from raw materials, with software that you wrote yourself too? Because otherwise, you cannot be 100% certain that your 'offline' machine isn't already compromised somewhere.


How so?


Because Trezor uses an HD wallet approach, the private keys can be backed up by writing down the master seed on paper.  This means the Trezor's bitcoin addresses and private keys are just as easy to back up, and by the same medium as you prefer - on paper.
To restore the bitcoin addresses and spend from them, you don't even need a Trezor - any compatible HD wallet will do. Just enter the master seed words into the compatible HD wallet.  Although of course using the Trezor is much safer because your private keys stay in the Trezor, which effectively signs transactions 'offline'.


You're correct there, paper wallets are much cheaper than a Trezor.  But:
You can't spend from your paper wallet, or move coins from it, without exposing the private keys in some way.  With Trezor, you can spend and move coins with relative safety and ease.
Also, there are privacy and convenience implications to using paper wallets.  Are you going to put all the bitcoins you buy/receive into the same paper wallet?  If so:
1 You're putting all your eggs in one basket, is that wise?
2 You're linking all those transactions, is that wise?
 
With a Trezor you can easily create as many different addresses to receive coins to as you like. Which means greater privacy, unless of course you release the XPUB.


Yes it is possible to install corrupted firmware - but in this case the Trezor will warn the user of this every time it is connected.


You can store your master seed for Trezor addresses in exactly the same ways.

The article you linked to is not about Bitcoin, it is about an alt coin.  
Doesn't seem consistent to me that this article is ok for this sub, yet &lt;removed lest I get banned&gt; is not allowed for discussion here, despite the fact it is not an alt coin.

To those who say "the moon!" - there could be an influx of new Bitcoin users, but only if Bitcoin can scale to accomodate them.
If the devs can't find a way to agree on how to scale this thing it isn't going anywhere, and a sudden wave of lots of new users is more likely to result in Bitcoin not being able to cope and straining under the pressure.  The mass influx will then be a mass exodus as new users decide that Bitcoin isn't reliable.
Bitcoin needs to be modified to ensure it is ready for the next wave of new users.

You are absolutely right that someone pays a cost.  
I'd like to take this opportunity to say 'thank you' to you. Because in 5-10 years when Bitcoin has transformed how money is moved around, the early adopters like me will have become rich because retards like you didn't see the future coming.  So, thanks for your wealth. I promise to use it well.

[Bill is a pet kept in a birdcage]
“Then he thought about what Bill himself might want. It was easy to guess. ‘Bill,’ he said, ‘I like you so much, and I am such a big shot in the Universe, that I will make your three biggest wishes come true.’ He opened the door of the cage, something Bill couldn’t have done in a thousand years.
“Bill flew over to a windowsill. He put his little shoulder against the glass. There was just one layer of glass between Bill and the great out-of-doors. Although Trout was in the storm window business, he had no storm windows on his own abode.
“‘Your second wish is about to come true,’ said Trout, and he again did something which Bill could never have done. He opened the window. But the opening of the window was such an alarming business to the parakeet that he flew back to his cage and hopped inside.
“Trout closed the door of the cage and latched it. ‘That’s the most intelligent use of three wishes I ever heard of,’ he told the bird. ‘You made sure you’d still have something worth wishing for—to get out of the cage.’”
Above is from 'Breakfast of Champions' by Kurt Vonnegut.
Bitcoin has opened the window, but many people don't want to be free, so they retreat back into their cages.
Is that really an intelligent choice? Discuss. (10 marks). lol
