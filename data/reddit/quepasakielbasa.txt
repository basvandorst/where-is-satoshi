This is FUD. Of course it is a public ledger, but if:

tell me what I spent my bitcoin on...that's what I thought. You can't.

My beef with buttercoin, circle and coinbase is that I need a legitimate broker in the US where I can buy or sell &gt; 50,000 USD at a time. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere until it is easy for bigger players being able to buy securely. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:40:39
Good for them. It might be too little too late. Why would anyone use this service? It was useful back in the day, but now it is insecure. Can VC withhold funds? This place needs a complete overhaul.

It can't be done without a starting address. The Forbes article gave away a starting address. It also helps if someone reuses an address. If you don't have a starting point and if I don't re-use addresses, it can't be done.

I hope you have a good plan for selling your bitcoins. If you don't, then yes it is reckless. If bitcoin goes to 10,000 USD, how would you sell 1m worth of bitcoin? Do you think that will be easy? If you have a plan, I would love to hear it. Are you going to leave all that money on one of these mysterious exchanges? If you go through Coinbase, their constantly moving limit will prevent you from selling all of your coins at once during the inevitable crash. Let's say bitcoin goes to 10,000. You will only be able to sell 5 at a time. If you lived through the 1200 crash, you know what it is like watching all that money disappear. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 02:46:28
ya know, misquote me. Then laugh at a made up comment. That's typical of your kind. The model of charging 1% is sustainable, never said Coinbase was or wasn't. Their model is. Pitchforks and all. 
I still don't know your agenda and at this point, I don't care. Whatever it is, it is not honest.

Miners can run any version of the software they like, even tweaked versions. Remember this operates by consensus. Also remember it is open source. If &gt;50% run a certain version, users are helpless. 
Regulation of the miners may be necessary if bitcoin is to survive such a scenario. The irony. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:47:26


Honestly, if you are at all afraid of losing your buying power, then bitcoin is not for you. 
Bitcoin may appreciate in value, but no one knows for sure. It is scarce and useful. Because of the limited supply, I believe it will increase in value...and I have put my money on it. You seem like someone with a low risk tolerance. I like to live dangerously. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:07:11

@_date: 2014-10-08 21:48:45


No. That is the point. The new boss is the same as the old boss. Bitcoin is centralized. Percentage-wise, this is as corrupt as any move made by a bankster. If people choose to enter the bitcoin economy, they should know that they are at the mercy of the miners and the early adopters. Look the other way and rest your case. Let me put this nicely for you: Fork you. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:03:43
I didn't buy a fucking thing. My bitcoin is worth a lot less than I bought it for and it doesn't make any sense to spend it now.  Maybe next year when we reach moon, but now, my kids get coal, which goes right in the fireplace if those leeches want to stay warm. Next year, I'll use my soon-to-be worthless fiat as kindling for the fire.

That's the key, you need missing data. That's one of several reasons you would never be able to determine what I spent my money on. How are you going to get that? Then, what if I covered my tracks. The point remains, when you say literally anyone knows what you spent money on, you are spreading FUD. It's simply not true. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:57:08


Not true. Look at the hash power of different coins. Look at which coin has the longest running blockchain. Look at the bitcoin economy and number of businesses that accept bitcoin. That also ignores that other altcoins have diffferent properties to begin with, such as confirmation times, block rewards, etc. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 00:10:04
There is nothing fraudulent here. They sell the bitcoins on exchanges. You didn't answer the question. What is your agenda for spreading disinformation?

@_date: 2014-10-13 00:21:46
When Coinbase buys bitcoins for USD, they already have buyers for the bitcoins lined up on exchanges. They don't accumulate bitcoins. They are taking a 1% cut of transactions. You are saying they don't have a sustainable business model. Their business model has been demonstrated to be very sustainable. Is your trolling sustainable? Probably, since people don't have time to correct your disinformation. What is your agenda?
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:23:11
do you have a life outside of trolling @_date: 2014-10-10 14:14:27
I don't know if concerned is the right word, but it is a big deal and makes it inconvenient to use bitcoin in the US. 
For those who don't know, if you realize a profit for buying something with bitcoin in the US, then yes you must declare that. It is classified as a property by the IRS and it is necessary to pay capital gains taxes. If you hold onto your bitcoin for greater than a year, you pay at a long-term rate, which is usually less than short-term taxes. A US rep is drafting legislation to treat bitcoin as a currency, which means that you wouldn't have to pay that tax. 
The benefit of this is that if you buy something with bitcoin and realize a loss, you can declare the loss and reduce your overall tax hit. I am sure that declaring a loss is pretty common this year considering the rough market.

I recall an analysis that showed Satoshi had a distinct nonce for the blocks he mined. It would be interesting to see if this block falls under that category. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 05:47:44


You seem confused. I don't think you want to get it. You need to understand that Bitcoin is an implementation of the blockchain technology.  The longest running blockchain is a property of Bitcoin, not of the technology. Do you understand? As long as bitcoin is around, no blockchain can claim to be older. 
Your main point is silly. First of all, if all the gold in the world was lost, more gold would be made by transmuting mercury or another element to gold. It isn't currently cost-effective, but if there wasn't any gold, it would likely be profitable. Also, do you really think that all the gold in the universe is on earth? Your thought experiment is ridiculous. 
If all bitcoin were lost, it wouldn't be possible to make more Bitcoins that have the property of 'being the longest running blockchain.' You couldn't just make more. You could make more gold, however.

All the senator was saying was that IF bitcoins were accepted as tax payment or IF congress appropriated bitcoins, then there would be a conflict. Those things will never happen.

You obviously have more time to spread disinformation than I would ever have time to correct your lies. The bitcoins used by the customer are swapped for USD on exchanges.

Do you think that Gavin kept this idea to himself and then decided to dump it on the market. If he didn't discuss this beforehand, that would be irresponsible. He told somebody and somebody used insider information and dumped 30k coins. This is as good of a theory of bearwhale as all competing theories.

I think that trying to switch everything to bits is part of the reason outsiders believe that bitcoin is a scam. It's like everyone is trying to change the decimal so that others will buy more. It seems disingenuous. 
When it comes to making a change, there is as much upside as downside.
At least with bitcoin as is, you only have 21 million. It is scarce, but with 21 million x 10 ^6, bitcoin no longer appears scarce. Appears is the operative word, since that's what this is about, after all: appearances. I would prefer that it doesn't change. It seems kind of sleazy to me...i.e. trying to change a decimal place so bitcoin doesn't seem expensive. It's the same damn thing. Why try to trick anyone? 
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:01:43

This post is just incredibly stupid. There have been plenty of people that bought bitcoin only to have it drop 40% the next day. Those people will say it sucks. There are also people who use these shoddy wallets and exchanges only to lose their bitcoin. Those people will say it sucks. It's not really a time to be bullish for a sane person.

A criticism from a Think Tank is worthy of a serious discussion. How could this be ignored? Remember when nobody would take Bitcoin seriously? Now, Bitcoin is addressed and ripped apart.

What happens when the hash rate drops since it is extremely unprofitable to mine? Ans: The block time will increase and there will be even more unconfirmed transactions. It's hard to run a payment network like that. Of course, this is ripe for abuse when unconfirmed transactions are ultimately dropped.  How long will you have to wait for a purchase if the block time becomes 30 minutes?  This will be an interesting month for bitcoin.

I find this interesting because there was a post to describing a hack to Gox while it was still running. I doubt anyone here remembers it, because I reported it and it got removed (reported under a different username). A month or so later, Mt Gox suspended operations. In hindsight, I realized it was a description of how gox had its coins stolen. It would be interesting to see if there is any way to link that post to the stolen gox coins. People can't keep things like this to themselves. It's just too juicy. They want to brag on forums.
