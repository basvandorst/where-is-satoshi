Aren't you scared? I have close to $400k. Not enought to retire, but enough that I am thinking of paying my house off. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:49:08
It is one of the largest exchanges in the world. I don't see why not. That Japanese exchange that got hacked and got NEM stolen. They figured a way to pay 500 million back and they probably have 1/10 revenue of Bitfinex (I am making up the numbers)
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:36:43
I just did a few seconds ago. I cash out 75% of all my crypto. Not exactly the 20% down payment I wanted, but enough for to sleep at night.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:22:32
What I am trying to say is that. When you are close to your moon, you don't see the dips and crashed the same way. I am scared now, and people keep telling me "don't invest more than what you can afford to loose". Using your example, when you are a 9x gains, what do you do? cash out at 9x, wait for the 10x, or hope it doesn't go down to 7x. The original 10k is so far behind.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:35:33
Then btc alone will die. It doesn't need to take down crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:14:31
Other futures expire on the 26th as well.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:14:51
I agree with what you say. Except that I would have my down payment in the first place if it wasn't for crypto. Anyone can have a 5% down payment. I was shooting for a 20% down payment. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:43:57
What a bunch of bullshit! One of the worst I have read. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:59:19
That chart again! Every time there is a 20% this chart gets posted.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:13:57
Because eventually it will be more profitable to buy btc cheap and  long it as oppose to shorting it. You can't short what you can't sell because you don't have any btc left to sell. Whales will have to eventually buy back in if they want to do this again. We might have another price surge like we did back in December when futures where announced.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:52:31
We now have futures guys! Whales are shorting bitcoin and hedging bitcoin the same time. It is a win win for them.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:04:43
Well, then what is everyones' moon then? buy a Xbox? When do you plan to cash out? 100k, 1 million, 3 million?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:33:50
Exactly, tether is probably back by a combination of crypto and usd, but with a ratio far greater than 1:1.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:15:17
You speak in past tense. Did cash out already?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:30:12
I am on the same path. I had been saving and buying stocks for 5 years. Last year I sold all my stocks for crypto and that is how I made most of my money. I made more money on crypto that on 5 years worth of stocks.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:39:11
I would be able to survive, but cashing out now means paying around 40% in taxes. If I cash out in a few months, I would pay less than 15%
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:16:37
I wish I could say that. I have close to $400,000 invested. The future of myself and my family is on this. Do I sell or do I hold. I sold $150k last week and bought back in during the bull trap. I don't want to make the same mistake again, but it is stressful and painful to watch this swings. I've been holding and buying for 10 months.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:33:24
On what time period? 10 years in the stock market sounds possible. How many in crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:41:34
Aren't they capped at 20%?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:40:45
Well, crypto peaked a few weeks ago and all the moon people that I've read where before that. I remember reading a bunch of post about people hitting their moon on ethtrader when eth reached $400. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:10:20
Thank you. I very well diversified. I can't cash out now though. I need to wait a year for my gains tkmo be taxed as capitak gains. Thanks for the advise.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:13:50
But if they are hedging with bitcoin then they!are afecting the market right? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:26:20

Could spend the 3 bitcoins directly? If a guy wanta to sell his car for 3 bitcoin. How will the IRS know that he spend it? (Assuming you have your btc on a decentralized wallet) you could technically claim you lost your 3 btc on an ICO scam. Am I missing anything? They only they couls find out is if they you.are living a luxurious life with no income to back it up.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:52:28
Stop making excuses and buy. Eth did not drop and it has not been affected by all these reasons. Buy BTC! Holding is not enough. Holding does not increase prices.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:03:47
Well, is it gamble or an investment? (I don't have it all on Bitcoin. I have numerous funds in Iconomi).

I am 33, married, baby on the way, living with my inlaws, no 401(k), shitty job, 2017 gave me so much money that pretty soon I might be able get my own place (if crypto goes up again)
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:37:03
The 100% of the people that they say (in reddit)they have hit their moon and cash out, have cashed out too early. I don't want to be that guy... I need 4 months for my crypto to be considered long term capital gains. The tax implication are huge!
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:46:24
exactly! unless you are putting only a few hundred bucks. Everyone's moon here is something that they would be able to afford to loose.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:01:01
I can't right until May. If I cash right  I will ve paying short term taxes (as income). On May my investment will become long term so I would only pay capital gains.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:43:16
Damnnnn. Seems like mostly bears are after bitcoin. Bearish whales got away with it on Wednesday. Hoepfully bull will win on the next one on the 26th. Seems that whales are more bearish than bulls. Bulls tend to be small investors.

Then why are you still here?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:05:38
I agree, but what options do I have? stocks and bonds? People have been waiting for the stocks to crash for many years now. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:47:50
Eth is not an alt. Eth and btc are equal trading pairs.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:04:08
Well, stocks would go up by a lot back then if you added .com at the end of your company name.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:20:12
It depends when did they sell their tether. All tether sold for the previous year (Jan to Decide) is backed 5 to 1 (you get the idea), but tethers sold in December are backed .5 to 1 (estimate) if btc crashes down to 2000 then I guess tether might collapse or Bitfinex will has to jump in and pay up front their profits. I don't think Bitfinex pumped the prices up by printing tether of thin air. It makes no sense for them to do that - it kinda looks that way because it is a lot of USD to immediately back up.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:00:10
They didn't disable btc though
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:46:18
The subpenad was back in December and it was after the tether hack. Bitfinex and tether is up and running just fine now.

Segwit is only 10% implemented. Give it some time.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:02:10
You can't time the market. Did you sell yesterday?
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:58:25
IMO, it will take a few months, but no more than a year. Segwit and LN will make bitcoin the best trading pair (compared to eth). More fiat exchanges will come out and more people will buy in. Try to check the price once a month if you can.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:01:29
It is impossible with the fees. We need LN fully implememted first.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:00:29
Exactly! I placed stop losses for 75% for my down payment which is 50% of my entire portfolio. We are close to hitting the stop losses.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:46:05
Worst case scenario, Bitfinex pays whatever is not  backed up. They could even pay 2 billion easy. People would cash out their USDT for btc. This is good for btc!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:48
It is not zero though. Check it out 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:49:09
I don't consider crypto gambling. If that the case, then all companies are vaporware.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:45:20
Btc could drop to 3000 and the graph would make seem like a bull from 500 to 3000
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:32:06
It on the 26th. I though whales where going to try and long bitcoin (after succesfullt shorting it on the 17) but  it appears they are going to short it again.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:27:00
Thank you THANK YOU. I believe you hit the nail in the head. You read my situation perfectly.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:03:24
I mean how many do we need for the average person to use LN without knowing it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:46:19
Unfortunately, price and demand will have to go down in order for the mempool to clear and fees to drop. Hopefully most exchanged will adopt Segwit, so price can start climbing back up.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:23:23

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:27:06
What I don't understand is why can't bitcoin.org make a statement? Why don't they say something?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:52:55
Segwit allows for cheaper and faster transactions. Withdrawing bitcoin out of gemini is almost free. In Coinbase it is damn expensive
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:15
We should bombard their tweeter and facebook account asking them to adopt Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:03:42
I already did. We need Segwit asap.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:06:40
When will that be?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:20:06
Samourai wallet is good. It has Segwit which will give you lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:09:20
Try it out for yourself in the github
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:24:19
Because they legally had to immediately sell the btc for USD in order to back the USDT that was given. However, keeping the btc I exchange for giving out USDT I'd a lot more profitable. A single btc bough by Bitfinex in September in exchange for USDT would now back up USDT for a 2:1, which is great for them, irrelevant to us, but it is illegal. This is the most likely scenario. In a nutshell, USDT is not backed (a 100%) by usd - it is backed with btc as well. Bitfinex is a extremely successful company, they don't need to pump btc with tether to become millonaries.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:11:12
Is this available in the U.S?

Keep holding.  I will get to 25k sometime during January. Look everything that has happened in the last two weeks. Anything can happen in a month. And remember, bitcoin has the best developers in the world. Over 100 of them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:06:32
Are you using Segwit wallets? Coinbase does have Segwit. Gemini does.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:03:08
Does Xapo use Segwit? Remember to use wallets/exchanges that have Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:50:32
How was the price of btc estimated at that time? How was priced being tracked if there was no exchanges that would sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:52:49
What can they do with only your email though? I've been lookong for the source, but I can't find it.

That is why I stopped using Coinbase. Gemini all the way!
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:11:55
We need to bombard coinbase and bitfinex to adopt Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:09:28
It is a nice option if you are planning on cashing out soon, but there are a lot of tokens that will go up more than the interest rates you would earn. Remember bitfinex takes 15%. There a reason why the interest rate are high. You will earn more money by buying crypto and holding - that is why people are paying those interest rates.

What exchanges support Segwit in the U.S? I've been emailing Coinbase, Gemini, and breadwallet to adopt Segwit. I send an email every 3 days asking the same thing.

Segwit has to be adopted in order for LN to  kick in
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:58:40
I only use Segwit wallets. I am going to flood all other wallets with emails and tickets until they accept Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:06:25
Exactly! Otherwise people will continue to say 18 months forever.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:15:13
Well, the value of btc is based on that. LN is required for btc to be a currency.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:50
Why do they matter? (At this moment). You should not be spending your crypto buying coffee if you believe price is going up. And there are tax implications when spending crypto to buy stuff.

@_date: 2017-12-15 16:48:45
Segwit allows for faster transaction and lower fees by artificially increasing the blocksize. Segwit was added to bitcoin on 8/1 but only a few exchanges have added it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:13:14
You can sell your bt1 now for .995 btc. Or, you can wait for 12/31 and bitfinex will give you 1:1 btc for bt1. My question to bitfinex is, when will they give us bitcoin gold or our bt1.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:07:48
That is why I only use Gemini.

leave it in coinbase for now. Coinbase is safe - don't worry.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:27:46
I recommend everyone to send them an email. All wallets MUST implement Segwit in order for bitcoin to succed.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:05:50
IMO I think it is. I am not worried at all. I have 8 bitcoins in Bitfinex at this moment.

For for a weekend night. Fees are lower.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:16:02
We are close to 15% now! Let's keep promoting Segwig by bombarding exchanges and wallets to adopt Segwit. Starting with Coinbase. Tickets, calls and email, tickets, calls and emails.
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:14:00
Exactly, and Bitcoin can success with a value of $5,000 or a value of $1,000 or $10,000.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:30:56
Done! In the mean time, I will use Gemnini, they do have Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:07:27
I am going to flood all exchanges and wallets that do not support Segwit. I am going send emails and tickets everyday until they adopt it. We bitcoiners need to go on STRIKE against non-Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:39:36
Maybe they plan to follow up with another email asking for your coinbase login info or private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:06:29
Gemini did it with no problems.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:30

@_date: 2017-12-23 10:58:07
Wtf?! You guys think this it?! This is not a crash this is a dip. Try hodl until btc goes to 5k then come back tell us how it felt. We simply lost a month's gains. A true crash loses a year of loses. This is nothing. We need to buy tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Decentralization  is everyrhing.

Lending usd will never give you 100% per year. Buying and holding crypto will definetly give you more than that - that is why there are takers. It is more securo though, but you are holding it all on one exchange.

Coinbase doesn't have Segwit. Use Gemini, it does have it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:10:21
We need to get coinbase and bitfinex to adopt Segwit. I already sent them an email. In the mean time, I'll use Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:27:29
No it won't - the fork was canceled. It is my understanding that bt2 would go to zero on 1/1/2018

Exchanges/wallets that have adopted Segwit will result with a lot lower fees and faster transactions. Segwit transactions can have over 2 mb of data.

@_date: 2018-09-24 14:28:10
Well, you can also blame her for bringing Bitcoin to institutions that caused btc to go from 10k to 20k. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:27:31
The funds only had a small percentage of btc. However, her mutual funds and ETF have not dipped/crashed this year.  Most of them are up 30% YTD and last year more than 50%. What intrigues me is that she cut her bitcoin holding in December and January. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:28:22
A guy posted it on r/bitcoin. I asked him, but he never replied. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:38:26
Just get a line of credit and pull the cash out. That what I did. I pay about $250 bucks a month for $15,000 line of credit. I was able to buy $15,000 of btc 6 months ago using a wire on gdax. It more that pay by itself. I could pay the line off, but btc is going up so much thay is no worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:22:07
Buy when people sell. Sell when everyone is buying (because it is rising). I am buying!!! I will pay in the long run. Give it a month at least. One month.

I only use wallets with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:58:10
Everyone using bitcoin should only use Segwit. We need to all do it for the good of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-19 03:27:16
Well, to be honest I paid more fees I. Bitcoin last year and this year than on Visa/MasterCard fees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:48:48
By sending email and support tickets. Tons of them!!!
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:46:13
How until exchanges start implementing LN?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:58:24
We have to keep spamming exchanges!! Non-stop everyday. Tickets and email asking for Segwit!
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:29:39
Answering to my complain cost them money. If their customer reps have to spend 1 hours a day responding to Segwit emails they will eventually see the cost.
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:08:04
Swap trading can be done with buying btc. It just makes shorting Bitcoin easier. This is bad.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:35:52
I agree with everything you said except your example of why Bitcoin is not a currency. $1 is worth 18 Mexican pesos, so does that mean that Mexican pesos is not a currency? I do agree that Bitcoin is not a legal currency (not in any country that I know of), you can't use it to buy stuff u less you are willing to pay taxes because it is considered a sell.
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:08:39
That is bull shit. Reddit is full of "I lost my keys can someone help me posts". Leave them in Coinbase and enable 2FA. You can even move them to Vault, which is Coinbase will provide you part of the key so nobody but you can withdraw the fund except you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:09:09
Thank you for posting this. It is very helpful - especially for someone new.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:13:30
They will give your bcash on 1/1 so yoi can withdraw it and sell it.
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:49:45
For many years everything in Tijuana (border city) was priced in dollars and everyone paid in dollars. My point is that you can have currencies. You can buy anything with US dollars in Mexico. Bitcoin can be the US dollars to Mexico in the future. The problem is that the country in which you bought the Bitcoin will want to tax it. Therefore it is not a very useful currency. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:19:21
The easiest and safest way by far is to go buy it in Coinbase. You are more likely to lose your keys or get hacked than Coinbase getting breached. I've been here long enought to know that.
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:08:34
It is pending shareholder approval and it is not a exchange, it is a technology provider.
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:45:32
What do you mean by "additional assets?". Because in real life(with a bank) your home IS your collateral. If you don't pay the loan back to the bank, the bank will take your house away. 
You need a centralized agency to confiscate the house, sell it etc. etc. You can't embed a house in a smart contract. How will the smartcontract kick you out of the house and take the house back? It can't.
An existing relationship with the banks proves nothing. It's all about credit scores and debt to income ratio.
@_date: 2018-09-18 04:42:46
Because you don't need to hold Bitcoin or buy bitcoin to trade them. Just like futures, and a lot of experts said that futures and the ability to short btc caused the crash.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:25:05
It makes sense for coinbase to want to use LN. I  sure 99% of customer service tickets are related to withdrawal and fees.
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:53:14
I agree that LN will solve most problems. Is just that LN is years away. It will probably take exchanges 3 years or more to adopt LN.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:13:44
The current dip is a great time to buy btc. Whales will start selling their bch and move back to btc soon. Btc has to get back to 20k by january. That is when the futures contract ends.
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:06:48
Have you tried buying in local bitcoin? it is not easy, and it is an inconvenience. We need to banks for adoption and to easily buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:55:22
It was not people not using Segwit addresses only, it was exchanges not using Segwit addresses. In order to be mass adopted, people should not need to know what LN or Segwit is. I have no clue how my Visa card works. All I care is that I swipe it and it works all the time. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:25:47
What do you mean by being your own bank? Will Bitcoin give you a car loan? Will Bitcoin give you a mortage? A credit card? 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:34:14
Collateral loans are shitty loans. People that have 400 credit score get collateral loans. How much collateral would you need to borrow 400k to buy a house? 
I don't dream, I read. I have over 60 eth in 5 CDPs open at this moment (your version of collateral loans) and I just found out the my collateral interest will be raised from .5% to 2.5% (paid in DAI). You might think it is decentralized, but it will never be 100%. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:54:18
Holy shit. Bitcoin is pretty much dead. Most of traffic is only by traders.
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:49:51
The products are not ready yet. Demand must come from a need, and what is the need to pay with crypto?
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:24:01
Do you wait at the counter for the 1st confirmation?
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:46:42
I see what you mean. In that case, I guess I do agree with you. It is good to be your own bank. However, we us banks will always (next few decades) need traditional banks as well (for mortgages, business loans etc). Banks helping banks I guess.
@_date: 2018-08-28 04:13:44
Why does it say 6300?

Because it does not take 10 seconds unless it was done via LN.

P2P loans? good luck getting someone to loan you 30k for a car or 400k for a house.

Are you for real? How on earth will you be able to get 50 btc loan with 5 btc collateral being your own bank?
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:02:03
I understand what you mean, but RSK to have a finished a product that would allow you to buy a home is  probably a decade away. You may be right that you can eventually be your own bank, but in the mean time, for the next 10 years, you need to continue using a bank. Bitcoin has been around for 9 years. Most likely we will be dead by retired by the time that happens.
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:17:18
I know it can scale, it is just a matter of when that will happen. If everyone is so sure that it will scale properly, where does the "don't invest more than what you can afford to lose" comes from? It comes from speculating on the fact that bitcoin may or may not succeed.
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:14:35
ETF has nothing to do with the pump. The stock market as well broke ATH today.
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:52:13
And why would regular Joe decide to pay with btc and all the tax implications it goes with it as opposed to using Visa? The only reason would be to avoid the taxes all together. That reason alone is not good enought.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:07:01
Did the exchange had Segwit? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:12:58
You can't send it in 10 seconds because confirmations take longer than that. It was okay because he was your friend so he trusted you, but in real life looking at it in the screen means nothing because you can cancel later and he would get nothing.
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:36:05
that is a different topic. The initial discussion was how will you obtain a mortgage loan without a bank (you being your own bank). You said adding "additional assets" to your collateral. What do you mean by that? 
Let say you want to buy a $400,000 (cheap house in San Diego), and you want to put 5% down ($20,000). How will you get a mortgage loan for $380,000. You said "however much I say since I am the bank. Since I am the bank the loan takes whatever shape I wish" That is completely false, you can call yourself a bank, but you will be able to create $380,000 worth of crypto/DAI/USDT/Tether out of $20,000 crypto collateral just because you call yourself a bank.

@_date: 2019-03-17 14:55:29
1.proves nothing.MLM and scams generate wealth as well. Most wealth was generated by whales. Most people got killed during the 2017 December bubble.
2. So?
3. Agree
4. A decade of indication and the product has net yet been massively adopted. It pretty mad has no adoption at all. Even in bitcoin conferences bitcoin is not accepted.
5. 100,000s ?Link? Source?
6.Global impact. - true 
7.Only if it recovers again, which has not.
8. Not really, worst crashed are when a country bans it. If the U.S bans bitcoin, believe it WILL crash. It be down to $1000 traded in local bitcoin only. 3rd world countries trading bitcoin may keep around $500 probably.
9.corporate media? It all depends if it recovers. If it does, the media was wrong, and you are right.
10. No leader yes, and that why it has taken bitcoin more than 10 years to develop LN. And it will need another 5 or so.

There are 10 books more by leading economists that will tell you that zero inflation is bad. There is less growth, less purchases. Imagine lending someone 1 bitcoin in 2013. Do you think he will be able to pay you back now? Do you think that is fair?
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:28:26
1. Bitcoin is innovation yes
2.10 years is a long time to not have working product used by the masses (holders do not count). Any startup would have gone bankcrupt by now. Bitcoin may never recover.
4. Agree that it is slow, too slow IMO. Bitcoin had its chance back in Dec 2017. If bitcoin would have had LN in early 2017. Amazon and other mayor retailers would be accepting bitcoin by now.
5. Agree, bitcoin introduced blockchain, but you as of now, blockchain can flourish and it will with or without bitcoin.
7. Hopefully not, I am holder after all.
8. the system moves on yes, but the price does not, nobody wants a stable bitcoin at $500 or $1500. Bitcoin needs to be in the $100,000 est.stable in order to prevent manipulation from billlionaires.
9. Until it doesn't. Look at gold or silver. Maybe it will recover, and in 2030 it will be at $10,000. With futures easily available. Limited availability of bitcoin is not enought for the price to go up. 
10. True, but not decades.
In reference to your last comment, bitcoin's price increase is the main reason why people buy. Libertarians, people that think fiat will collapse, bank will fail, all government sucks, etc are a minority - mostly conspiracy theories.
Thank you for the nice and detailed rebuttal. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:47:43
Some inflation is good though. 2% is ideal because it keep people from holding forever.
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:03:34
Exactly, and for bitcoin to succeed where a government bans it, it is almost impossible. Buying bitcoin with cash is difficult. 99% of bitcoin's price it is because of non-authoritarian regimes

"is just a matter of adoption" has been said for 10 years - TEN, and I am sure many more are needed. Banks won't go bankrupt. And if they do, I would spend my money buying crypto. I would be buying canned food and bottled water. 99.9% of Bitcoin buyers use their Bank to buy bitcoin. Be real.

Bitcoin has a lot of catch up to do. Bitcoin does 5 TPS and Visa does over 5,000. That is a huge difference. By the time bitcoin implements LN people wont even use credit/debit cards anymore.
@_date: 2018-10-29 03:46:12
4 digits is not a lot for an entire year. $100 bucks a paycheck would have done it.

It okay for currencies to be deflationary. 1-2% inflation is fine that way it encourages spending. Imagine if there would only be a fixed supply of USD. We wouldn't get any. All the 1% would have it all.

@_date: 2018-06-23 01:19:02
The OP's argument was that another reason why we need BTC is because capital one 360 has secret ACH limits. That is such a stupid reason. People that say that we don't need banks and credit cards are crazy folks living in their own Utopia.
What the OP is experiencing is nothing new. I worked many year at a bank and limits are different for every customer and the limit changes from time to time based on many factors (times used, average balance, amount of transactions, location). 
The OP is just bitchin about something that all bank use all the time on every customer. It is not new information, he is just complaining.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:51:45

The sharp rise is a result of square's new licence. Adoption is everything!

Exactly! Bitcoin got it's chance to be adopted and failed last December. Segwit alone will not cut it this time. We need LN asap!
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:22:21
Not everyone can hold forever. Bitcoin has been around for over 9 years. If it hasn't been publicly adopted by the time it reaches 10, then it is not a successful product IMO. Most startups/ business fail or succeed within that time frame.
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:02:33

43% of bitcoins are being mined by bitmain. How is that decentralized?

Bitcoin Lightning Wallet. The developers of Eclair lost their private keys. They won't be able to make any updates to the wallet, ever. Quite embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:08:53
2-4 years.  I believe over 1 year counts as long term.

The first bubble was created by underground smart nerds. The second bubble was created by millenial geeks. The third on was started by tech millenial with credit cards and fueled by investors and regular people.
For the fourth one to start, we need regular people and investors back. We can only push the price up to a point. Adoption is the only way that will fuel the next one. That is why we need real use cases for regular non-crypto people. It is non-apple stock holders that drive the stock price up.
Besides Golem, anyone else know of any other use cases for non-crypto people?
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:38:45
How much do you think a dollar is worth?
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:38:11
We don't want btc to go over 10k unless LN has been implemented. LN is a necessity for retail adoption, and the next bull run will be filed by adoption. Segwit alone will not cut it.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:03:34
How long until LN is massively adopted by retailers? Years?
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:25:45
No, but can double spend. And you can't call bitcoin decentralized if one company can trigger its own destruction. People can panic and start selling.  This concentration of power with bitmain is getting crazy. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:58:31
What do you mean by that? Put it in an index fund?
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:02:29
That was a good read. Thank you for posting.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:53:30
It turns out Bitfinexed was right all along. Damnn we got played big time.

1176 is waaay to much for me. I can wait 1 more year and and only if good news about adoptions comes out. So far there is none (that any normal person can point at)

How do you know? If you are so sure, why don't you open longs at 20x leverage.
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:41:17
Right, and what would you have done for the first 20 years of the 25? Accumulate for 20 years? Not thanks. I have shorter time frames in sight, a house, money for my kid etc. 25 years is a life time.
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:58:39
That is something that eth could do a lot better 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:27:57
Oh yeah haha. true.
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:02:13
I'll be more than happy to use btc for my everyday purchases as soon as it is considered a currency. Right now it is treated as a stock, and you need to pay taxes on it. You can either hold and do nothing or spend it and pay taxes. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:06:34
You are using leverage and a platform. It is different, and you are right, forex gains do pay taxes. But for bitcoin, buying a 6 pack on  a 7-11 is considered a taxable event. That sucks! 
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:23:33
Thank you. That sounds scary.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:07:24
If you are betting your money and Bitcoin in the fact that all economist are wrong then you will be in for a surprise.
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:04:29
For beginners, what happens if bitmain reaches 51%?
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:30:16
Is this suppose to give me comfort? That means that bitcoin could drop to $3500 and you would say that everything is fine because bitcoin is up 33&amp; (aprox.) from a year ago.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:51:14
1-2% inflation is what pretty much all economist and experts  would recommend. I've looked it up many times.
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:31:58
Agree, but the fact that it is up to them to decide is not cool. I hope that more competition opens up.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:25:35
Antpool is controlled by Bitmain Technologies LTD. That is a fact.
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:53:30
Thank you for explanation. I just wanted to make sure the fundamentals where still strong.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:28:29
I solda) my Netflix stocks last year for Bitcoin. Worst decision so far.
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:56:46
I think it is only New York.
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:23:23
The link above (by TheGreatMuffin) paints a different more scarier picture though. How is that not a concern on decentralization? I guess it is in bitmain best intereset to not get close to 51&amp; I would not want to be holding bitcoin if bitmain has 51&amp;
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:09:35
It has been 9 years already. How many do you think Bitcoin needs to be functional? 15?
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:50:04
The whitepaper is counting on the fact that it will be used as currency though.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:13:21
True true. But I wish the value of bitcoin would be based on it's adoption and use as a currency, not  value based on speculation simply because FOMO. Why is bitcoin worth 7500 now, and 15000 5 months ago? no fucking clue, markets, whales etc etc. who knows, but it not because of adoption decreased.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:59:04
2x then. My point is that if you are so sure, you should do it.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:01:05
but are you buying?
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:26:19
it If your money gets stolen, then you can sue them for 5x times as much. All credit cards have limits. You don't need to use if you don't like. Why don't you try an use some of crypto lending services like Salt, Lend, WeTrust or get a CDP.
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:53:04
Yeah, I know. I don't hold any, I sold it all a while ago, but I like the fact that someone is doing something. Bitcoin.org should have a donations page or something and use those funds to promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:28:06
I know, but my point is that we are at their mercy.

It has been more of a investment tool for trader and holders and than as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:49:35
Apparently it is bad news because everyone is selling. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:03:02
Wow!! That is an awesome quote haha. I am also more at peace now than last month even though the market is a lot worse now.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:26:20
I should have cash out like you did. I wanted to sell, but I wanted to wait a year to pay capital gains and not income taxes. That year felt like an eternity.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:33:00
That means that I could go down to 4000 and you would still day "it is up 25% from last year"
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:56:52
20 years? Netflix started in 1997 and was making profits and we'll known in 2002. Bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years and it is unusable as a currency.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:27:14
The infrastructure will do just as well with a price of 1000 or 2000. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:35:28
5 years ago you could buy shit with btc. 5 years later and you can't buy shit, and if you do buy stuff, you have to pay taxes on it.
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:27:25
A lot of people. Especially now that a bunch of tokens are moving to the main net. Imagine buying a coin, moving it to your wallet, and four months later, your coins are worth nothing because you did swap it for the new tokens or didn't move it to an exchange for the swap. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:24:00
Dude, you are crazy. if Bitcoin goes down to $50 then it means it was never a good investment. Btc has been around for 9 years. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:14:00
Yeah right. You are in for the tech.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:03:05
I've made 4 mistake in one year. One was selling on the first crash in January, two is buying back in a few days  only to sell again on the following crash and to buy again last month. So, I would have a lot more money now if I would have sold any, but I would also have a lot more money if would never bought back it. What do I learn from this? To never sell or to never buy back? I don't know. I am inches away on being negative. I am about to loose all my November gains.
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:49:45
You really think everyone here is for the tech or the money? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:17:28
So according to the whitepaper, how is everyone supposed to get their bitcoin if not via fiat exchange? by mining?
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:52:39
That is what I did. I only bought $100, but that is enough to for me combat the need to panic sell.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:55:35
I don't want to get rich quick. I just want to not lose money. I am okay with a 12% rise a year. I don't mind holding, but I am scared that btc will never be adopted. There aren't any news out about adoption.
@_date: 2019-08-18 02:37:14
So they should buy dollars or another first world currency.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:08:33
Exactly. All for nothing. I would have been better with stocks.
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:16:03
If you don't like capital one then pull your money out. They are protecting your money. And believe me, banks are doing a lot better job than crypto exchanges.
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:05:06
Have you sent any other crypto token?
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:17:47
Thank you for the information.
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:21:56
We are years or decades away from being called a currency. It needs to be classified as a currency in order to be a currency. Paying taxes on every bitcoin transaction I make is ridiculous. 
Also, I would say that being accepted by thousands of retailer is a way to measure public adoption yes. I would like to travel the world and be assured that I will be able to pay with bitcoin mostly anywhere.
It want's t be a currency. You can use it as currency now. I am still bullish on bitcoin and I am heavily invested. Is just that it is taking forever and there is no marketing, no PR, no nothing. What happened to the old fliers comparing Bitcoin to Western Union? In order to be considered currency, people need to start using it a lot and not just hold. Holder are making bitcoin be used as a stock. That is the one thing I give to bcashers, they want to use it a currency and try to use as much as they can.
@_date: 2019-02-18 06:40:02
Not a lot of developers are working on that though. I don't even see a roadmap. Bitcoin should stick to LN for now.
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:38:06
What? You really think person to person is gonna get people to use bitcoin? And buying things like bitcoin is not like buying with cash. Buying with cash is not tax event. It this mentality of "don't pay taxes" that gives bitcoin a bad reputation.
@_date: 2019-02-07 23:40:53
What if the parents of the kid gave the kid cash? Is the kid supposed to go an open a bank account and the open another account at an exchange and buy bitcoin and then send it to his friend and then wait in front of your friend for 10 minutes waiting for confirmation. That is bullshit.
A simple and good example would be; pretend you are a Jew  in 1940 and you need get the hell out of Germany. How do you take your money out of Germany? Yep, the answer is bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:27:35
What is wrong with that? iDrive and Google Drive have never been hacked and probably never will. I feel a lot safer having my private keys in Google Drive than in any other place or cloud. Coinbase is safe, period.
@_date: 2019-02-01 06:16:51
The only way for bitcoin to go up is if more people use it. So far there is only 1 user friendly exchange (coinbase) that allows that. What is the point of bitcoin of you can't sell it for cash? Buying things with bitcoin is a tax nightmare.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:37:24
Is just like buying a house or a car. I don't want to sell because I earning more profits (future profits) if I hold

It is a good time to invest. CME bitcoin futures will increase the price in December.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:01:06
BLX was the first crypt fund available to the public. Kinda like a mutual fund. It mainly includes bitcoin and eth as their main holding, and about 20 other altcoins. There are over 10 funds available at Iconomi. BLX will be listed in the Irish Stock Exchange next year. There are about 10 funds available to choose at Iconomi. BLX was the best one. Each fund has a its own manager. The pros are: you don't have to hold mutiple wallets, a lot easier to buy one token as opposed to 20 tokens, you don't have to actively manage your tokens, the funds are re balanced every month. Cons: Your token security depend on one company only (cold storage though), and fees.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:23:19
This is awesome! It is going down.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:06:57
Most likely no. But overstock does and their stock has risen more than 300% this year. As soon Amazon sees that it will accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:48:39
Good idea. Always buy the dips. We will back in the 7000s by end of this month.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:39:25
Buy! I got my credit card and bought $1000 worth of btc. Fuck bch and korean pumps!
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:41:42
I sold all my bt2 (future b2x) a few days ago. I prefer to secure a good 15-18 profit than risk b2x plummeting after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:21:35
Bch mining difficulty will go up 400% on November 13. Btc will be more profitable to mine once again. Everything is going to be okay.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:49:19
Yes I do actually. I am glad U.S exchanges are now regulated and I am glad the world is regulating ICOs. You want to use a single crypto currency to cover all your needs and that is not possible. Not everyone wants to be anonymous - there are other coins that are focused on that. And yes, I am confident you want to use VPN service to do something illicit. If not, then use your debit card like 99.9% of population.

Aren't CME futures expiring this week at about $8500? I think  whales are trying to push the price down to fill the gap.
@_date: 2019-02-26 03:31:36
This comparison is bullshit. And I assure you that 99% of the volume in PayPal is real use and real purchases. Bitcoin's volume is mainly just traders.
@_date: 2019-02-02 00:27:03
It is the government that decides what is taxed and what is not, not you. Try buying a house with bitcoin and see how that goes. Not paying taxes is no joke. Good luck!

We need more details and more photos.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:30:11
Yes, hold and buy more. You honestly think BCH is legit? you can't even buy it with fiat in the U.S. It is a pump caused by koreans and s2x backers.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:32:51
Buy the dip is no joke!
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:30:14
Hold and hold, and buy the dips. Keep it on the exchange for now. You can move it out later when fees drop and when you have more money. Welcome to crypto and congratulations.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:21:58
Just hold another year. There is no point in spending it anyways if price continues to go up.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:10:16
correct, it is a wallet, but it attempted to fork last year. They tried but failed to do what bcash did.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:20:52
What risk? Even if they don't honor de contract. You can sell your bt1 for .99 btc. That is awesome considering we sold our bt2 for 17% whilr everyone else waited for a fork that never happened.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:28:02
Btc should be more profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:54:56
That "fix" will actually cause  bcash price to drop as it increases the difficulty.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:30:36
You should be buying more. Why sell at its lowest?
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:16:08
That will take another 5 years.  Bitcoin will be around for almost 15 years. When is a long term investment too long?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:32:12
The reason for the drop is because all the developers from bitcoin classic moved to bitcoin cash. bcash is up more then 40% on the last 24 hours. We need to buy the dip and use segwit addresses. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:09:39
There is nothing wrong with leaving it on Gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:39:49
It is the otherway around. Bch is more profitable to mine now. You honestly think korea decided to buy bch all of a sudden? A 180% growth in three days is not healthy. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:14:48
I used to work for wells fargo. I am grandfathered with the team member credit card. It is not rare to have less than 10% though.

True, I am hodling long term. I don't mind waiting.
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:33:26
Only one is about bitcoin, the others are about the tech. The history of the dollar would be in the history section, not in tech.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:45:10
We are almost there guys. Keep holding and buying.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:13:45
Good luck staying off grid then. Make sure the NSA doesn't look at your reddit posts.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:19:27
I could but I wont.I am 99% sure that bitcoin will go up more than 8% (my apr) in a year. I could pay it next week if I could too. I would be buyint  bitcoin if would think it would not go up more than that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:40:26
Good timing!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:43:11
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:23:18
I did it a few days ago when it was at .16. It better to do it now because you can do it more than once. Is like having multiple forks. And, I don't believe the b2x will overtake btc. Might as well sell now at a higher price than wait for the messy fork.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:12:04
1600-1700 sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:08:33
It was with a credit card so yes I did. I already made more than my credit card interest rates.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:30:39
Segwit is only &lt;10% implementes. Wait a few weeks. Fees will drop and transactions will be faster.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:57:51
Oh I see. In that case I haven't made profits - zero. I am still in debt by those standards.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:47:40
40% crash doesn't sound too bad after 500% gains this year alone.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:43:48
I am buying. Not often you see it under $6000
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:05:14
I use gemini
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:42:13
I am honestly not a day trader. I prefer 10% a month and the piece of mind.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:15:10
You are very welcome
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:02:45
10,000 by 12/28/2018? That is awful. But should we be happy that way we can buy a bunch of futures at 10k when most likely bitcoin would be 30k. This isnour chance to buy super cheap bitcoin futures. Imagine if on 12/28/2017 we would have bought bitcoin futures at 3k last earlier this year.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:29:18
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:57:49
We can do both if we use segwit wallets. Here is the list 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:12:02
right. that what I said. bitcoin classic never forked. I didn't know that they implemented bitcoin unlimited though.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:59:18
Right now is the great time to jump in. I won't be long before we are back in the $7000
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:14:28
It is a screenshot of my blockfolio. Those two transactions are mine. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:14:09
So bcash will drop again when the new difficulty kicks in. Just like it did back in august. That is good for btc.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:00:15
I sold all bt2 futures last month. I am glad I did.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:23:43
Why would want to pay with btc? That will be considered a sell and you will have to pay taxes to the IRS. There is no point in spending btc if the price is going up.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:59:57
Ha, got it okay. Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:41:42
Koreans are attacking btc. It should be okay next week.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:16:57
There is a verification process required on a certain amount. I am not sure what is the amount though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:30:31
It is clearly a text book pump and dump. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:42:38
Good! It averaged nicely
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:44:12
Me too. I had 10 btc.I sold 2 btc and bought 8 bch. I can now sleep at nigh and not have to worry about who is going to win.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:20:02
Wasn't that the reason bch dropped from 900 to 400 in August? It was exactly when theu increased the difficulty.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:03:14
It was a move by the miners and ceos. It was planned al along. This pump is being caused by segwit2x and bcash backers.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:51:55
I am so glad I sold my bt2. I got free coins. I feel bad for bt2 holder though.

Bigger blocks is not the answer. You will need 40 mb block and 100 mb blocks ina few years.

Bitfinex and Coinbase will implement Segwit soon.  That will help tremendously.

Why would it be that stupid? BLX fund has been around for almost a year. It is well diversified and managed. I need to do more comparisons. The article only mentions the past 30 days. I need to check the previous 6 months as well.

Shill out. It not even close to the last attack. Bch will not reach 2000 and btc price will not go lower than 7000
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:25:32
Segwit is at 15% right now. Who gives a shit about fees now. If segwit is at 90% and fees are high then yes, we have a problem. Block size are just band aids. Look at the ridiculois bcash pumps and dumps. 50% volume by koreans controlling and entire coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:35:11

How do you know though? Bch just dipped to 1200
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:15:32
It should be more profitable. Look at the volume. 50% is from korea. It is not based on demand. It is a textbook pump.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:39:33
It is over guys. We are going up!

Bitcoin is not going to die. And if it does, it will take a long time. Don't let a few days of fud make you sell your btc. Imagine if you would have sold yesterday when it was at 5700. Would you would have bought back in today at 6400? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:34:14
Cool! I'll set it up this evening. Thank You!

@_date: 2017-11-12 06:16:23
People are not buying bch. Only korean miners are. Look at the volume 50% of is from korea. People didn't just wake up and decide to buy bch for no apparent reason.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:56:15
the bitcoin classic never forked (back in 2016). Those developers now moved to bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:20:35
Credit card and coinbase baby. Good time to buy. Btc will fly back on november 13, when bch is no longer more profitable to mine.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:13
It is not just Coinbase. Gemini and Kraken as well. To much volume at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:20:11
your 4.06 will be as bt1. The price of bt1 is a lot lower than btc. You cannot convert bt1 to fiat. You are going to wait for the fork that way bitfinex converts your bt1 into btc.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:51:37
Not yet, they are forking again this evening. I believe they have a few more blocks to go. Bch is slooow right now.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:58:43
oh yeah. I guess you are right in that sense.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:32:55
I am glad I sold all the bt2. Now I need to wait for my bt1 to convert back to btc and I am good to go.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:11:06
The hype will come when it breaks the 20k barrier and shoots to a 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:06:48
Maybe not in the short term, but definetly in the long run. Bitcoin is not mainstream yet. ETF haven't rolled out, the first crypto fund is out next month, lots of good news ahead. There is a bright future ahead (long term). I don't think it will go down long term (years) like you said or how it happened back in 2013-14. And in that case, I would stop buying (if the is no future) and start paying off my line of credit. I am not getting a second mortgage or anything. It is like buying a new car except that most likely the car will go up value.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:17:50
How do you know? In that case, feel free to short bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:15:19
In can pay my debt fine and I still have room to buy on a bi-weekly basis. If it feels like 2013-2014 then I'll pay my debt quick or use my tax returns.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:51:59
Because small block is not the issue. Miners are sending empty blocks. And some blocks are not full.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:58:29
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:00:44
We need to buy the shit out of this. I just credit carded  1000 bucks in coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:23:16
Eth might be dead but not btc. Do you remember happened to bch last time they adjusted the difficulty? It pumped from 400 to 1000 and down to 400.  This is no different.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:04:29
It is a fuckin korean pump. Another one. Bithumb has 42% of the volume.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:51:29
Bitfinex allows you to sell b2x futures. You move yoru btc to bitfinex. Split it for bt1 and bt2. bt1 will convert to btc after the fork. Sell the bt2 for .17 btc . In the end end, if you had 1 btc, you will have 1.17 bt1. On November 13, your 1.17 bt1 will convert to btc.

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:07:02
Correct. Once you put all your coins in a segwit address then you are good. It should be fast and cheap to get them out. Is sort of "grouping them together" kinda thing.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:53:16
SEGWIT is a branch of Bitcoin blockchain released in August 24th 2017. This branch was created to:
optimize signature delay, up to 60% time and
save some fees on each transaction
For instance using a Segwit address is definitely recommended if you plan to collect small transactions such as mining rewards. But it can also be used for any kind of transactions, and/or for all your transactions.

@_date: 2017-11-18 02:49:19
Don't scared. I've never heard so many good news for bitcoin in a while. A 5% dropped is nothing. Ignore bch. Buy, hold, and don't check the price every day.

Here is the list

@_date: 2017-11-23 04:19:41
I did. I sold my bt2 for .17 btc. That is an instant 17% gain.
@_date: 2019-02-13 14:16:27
Not a lot. Or, a lot less than us keeping our private keys "safe".

Litecoin would have the same problem if it had the same amount of user as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:46:03
Better use of Segwit. We say great improvement when it was 15% implemented.

Btc will be both. How can bch reach levels of visa with no scaling? You need block sizes of 1Gb to reach bisa levels. In 2 years 8 mb block will be obsolete.
Bch is like buying a bunch of hige open dirt field and have cars drive by. Btc is a highway well connected.

Why would miners leave? Btc if more profitable to mine now.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:16:08
Price might dip a bit in two days. The difficulty for miners will be adjusted.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:56:52
That is why we need to use segwit wallets. Here is the list 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:47:32
Probably the b2x price coinbase sold for you. Or bitcoin cash. I don't know.

They are not necesary. Miners are not even filling 1 mb and they send empty block. Bitcoin 15.1 should fix that and segwit should help with the fees. We are only at 15% segwit

 we still have a few more hours to go
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:16:32

Bch has a hard fork on nov 13 to increase difficulty. It will go down.

Not yet. 12 more hours to go. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:46:44
I would buy it now (if you can afford it). It dipped a little bit today so it should be a good entry point.

Risky move, but I guess it is worth it.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:47:51
Is 4000 is nothing. We need about 500,000 in order to support Visa like amount of transactions.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:03:38
I don't believe in the "invest only what you can afford to lose"  nobody would invest in their 401k or IRA for that matter. That applies to gambling. Following the rules means that you are not sure of the tech/Bitcoin and that is why you only invest gambling money.

@_date: 2018-02-15 05:03:58
A 50% down payment on a home for my family in San Diego. I almost had it last month when I had 400k, but it dropped to 200k and I panic sold a 100k (big mistake). Right now I only have 100k invested and 100k cash. A new ATH market will get me there.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:31:09
LN is part of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is 10 years old. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:09:03
You can't really believe in Bitcoin and the tech and say that at the same time (long term). The moment you do that, you are putting Bitcoin in gambling territory, and not in investment territory.

Dude, anyone with any serious money is afraid right now. You must have only a few thousand bucks invested to be so shilled. Please take into consideration that some people have lost a lot of money. I have lost over 300k during the last 2 weeks and I've been in this for almost a year. And don't say "don't afford what you can't lose" some people have real goal or real "moons"

@_date: 2018-02-22 14:21:52

@_date: 2018-02-01 16:26:39
You get the idea.
@_date: 2019-01-31 22:12:18

Yeah so? Almost nobody uses bitcoin, but millions use apple and apple pay.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:08:00

@_date: 2018-03-12 19:55:01
Are you using your own Bitcoin as hedge? In what platform?
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:36:34
How to the people in your group buy their stuff? Using a Bitcoin debit card? All debit card vendor will report purchases to the IRS, if you sell at coinbase or gemini, they will send you a 1099 as well. Only a handful of vendor will accept Bitcoin directly and you will have to illegally evade taxes.  Makes you wonder why Bitcoin has a bad rep. The law I believe was for 600 (if it passes) I hope it does.

How much are you buying though? You could have easily bought dozens of bitcoins during 2014-2015 and you would be retired by now. The price will not go up by people like you buying $50 bucks.

Then you post is misleading. What matters is percentages. I could start with 10$ bucks and make 10x gains in a year and have $100 in total. I can then put in another $1000 and short it and earn an extra $200 and claim you made more money shorting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:05:23
Spend half my tax returns on bitcoin and then hold.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:07:54
There is a big differenct between 2,200 and 800 - almost 300%. You are just trowing numbers around. You have no clue. That is like saying the it can rise again to 5000, 10000 or 15000.

When has that happened on a mayor licensed exchange? Bitfinex is not a liqui.io or bittrex exchange - it is downright illegal.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:52:05
You are very welcome. Note that you can always get your btc back before fork. All you would need to do is buy bt2 again and combined it with bt1 (same amount) and would get back your btc. You would only do that if you believe btc will die, or you believe b2x will go up by a lot. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:08:50
What about the bitcoin core and bitcoin unlimited?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:07:54
There is a big differenct between 2,200 and 800 - almost 300%. You are just trowing numbers around. You have no clue. That is like saying the it can rise again to 5000, 10000 or 15000.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:34:05
What would be estimate? Are we talking $3 down from $7 or we talking 50 cents or pennies?
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:12:07
You can move them in, split them, and sell bt2 now. However, you won't be able to pull them out before the fork.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:38:28
How long for regular user be able to use LN without knowing. Like for buying stuff online on a cup of coffee?
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:57:45
That is why I already split my btc and sold my bt2. I don't believe b2x wilk be worth more than bt2. I wish I would have done it at the beginning when bt2 was .20 btc.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:22:28
A lot of new cash came in because of gold. It is a good thing. People haven't congregated their btc yet. This was expected.

You have no idea what you are talking about unless you have an insignificant amount invested. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:44:28
Bitfinex is the only exchange that allows you to trade bt2(b2x) in advance. 1 Bt2 is worth .13 btc. If you believe b2x will be worth more than .13 then wait at the fork. IMO b2x will be shit, so I prefer to sell now now while it has valie than wait for the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:37:48
Not sure about the miners, but not all wallets are segwit. Everyone moving around btc from/to exchanges/wallets that are not segwit caused it to drop. After the fork happens people will move their btc to their segwit wallets and the segwit use should shoot up. All this I heard on the The Crypto Network channel/podcast. It makes sense.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:13:04
Everyone should sell b2x now! Move your money to bitfinex, split your btc for bt1 and bt2. Sell bt2 (future b2x) for a good .15 btc and repeat! 
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:32:26
In my case it is not a risk. Unless I need for bail or an emergency I am okay having it locked. I could sell the bt1 but it is not worth the same price as btc. It's better to wait for the fork for the 1 to 1 convertion
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:41:57
How do you know they don't have reserves? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 04:34:14
The fact that you are still hanging out here after half a decade make me feel sorry for you. You should have learned by now not to have an attitude.. But even after all, I don't wish you or anyone get hacked or robbed. I've seen it first hand with MEW and EtherDelta. You on the other hand are hoping that I get robbed so you can prove a stupid point. Have a good night.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:42:07
So close to retirement, are going to able to afford to lose it all? See what I mean. Retirement is your moon. My moon is a down payment, my down payment is going away right now just like your retirement could a few months before you retire. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:12:36
I forgot to reply to your other comments. There a lot of ways for hackers to get to your private keys (if you actually use them). For example, MEW does not hold your keys, but there have been a bunch of websites that look alike that steal your private keys. Same happened to Ether Delta. They hacked the server and replaced it with an exact replica and people started to enter their private keys into the fake website. I do keep most of my keys in Trezor model T, but I wouldn't mind at all keeping them in Coinbase. You can't buy certian tokens and hold them in your wallet forever, not now that tokens (erc20) are going live and you need to do a swap. Imagine 4 months later that you erc20 tokens is useless because you missed out on the swap (ICX for example). My point is, you can't compare Fiat exchanges with non-fiat exchanges. Coinbase is bulletproof, did you know you can keep part of your key yourself and the other part in an offline vault? That is pretty damn safe. There is a reason why they haven't been hacked.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:32:29
What happens if to bt1 in the event that is NO fork?  For example, If I sell all my bt2 now and keep only bt1.

He died on Sunday though.

How low will the fees be when segwit is implemented at 90%?
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:00:55
Your side note is right! That would be a way to bail out before the fork. I would only do it if bt2 is dirt cheap, and if I have a hunch that the price of b2x might go up after the fork so I could sell b2x for more than what I bought bt2.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:26:32
Right right. Then yeah, don't do it if you are a U.S resident. Sucks. It a good way to make instant 20% profit.
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:01:49
Do you track your purchases and pay taxes, or are you evading paying taxes overall?
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:49:35
It is only out on bitfinex. It is a future trade bt2  future-represents b2x. You can trade bt2 the same way it would be b2x except that you can't tranfer it, but yoi can sell it for cash or btc - that is what I did. It is a no brainer if you believe b2x will not dethrone btc.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:54:16
Just move them over to bitfinex and click on Token Manager. You will get equal amounts of bt1 and bt2. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:04:00
Bitfinex is the most secure exchange of all. They learned their lesson. Do you know of any exchange that has been hacked twice? Nope
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:43:41
Exactly, that is why I sold all of my bt2 to buy more btc.
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:42:07

@_date: 2017-10-17 14:38:30
I am kinda getting tired. Last dip (June-July) it bought as much as I could, I even took out a line of credit to buy more. This time, I am tired, I am getting tired of buying the dip (dips). I just want leave my coins in my wallet and forget about it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:08:42
Exodus is a nice wallet
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:45:44
It is not dead, but it will die. That is why is better to sell b2x now (on bitfinex). b2x(bt2) was worth .2 btc three weeks ago. Right now it is only worth .14. The price will continue to drop. Might as well sell bt2 now for more than a thousand than b2x after the fork for a few hundred bucks.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:33:54
Damnn, so a decade until btc can handle Visa's number of transactions. That sucks. Blockchain will be old tech by then.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:57:29
If you b2x becomes the true bitcoin then you are screwed (what are the odds?). Right now there is only one way to do it, and it is through Bitfinex. Move your btc to bitfinex, go to Token Manager (at the top) and split your btc. You will get 1:1 bt1 (future btc) and bt2 (future b2x). You can then sell bt2 for  cash or for btc. the price of a bt2 now is around .15 btc. You can then keep that btc or split again if you like.  Your bt1 will remain bt1 until the fork, after which it will convert back to btc on a 1:1 ratio. Bt2 was worth .2 btc three weeks ago, I wish I would have done it back. I don't believe b2x will be worth more than what bt2 is worth right now. I prefer to take an instant 15% than wait for fork see the b2x price drop. If you think that b2x will be worth more than .15 btc then wait for the fork. Is really easy. I recommend everyone that supports btc to do it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:13:21
You can split your destroy you 1 btc into  1 bt1 and 1 bt2. You can also combine 1 bt1 and 1 bt2 to create 1 btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:50:24
Bt1 will be  converted to btc 1 to 1. In that case you should be glad you sold your bt2 because nobody is getting b2x. If you are bt2 supporter and sold bt1, then you are screwed, you get nothing.
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:42:05
So what?! Have you ever had your money stolen from a bank?
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:58:47
GBTC sells you btc with a high premium and you can't withdraw it and use to buy something. Of course I want to get rich, otherwise I would hold any Bitcoin. Don't tell you me you are only here for the tech. 
Do you really expect  senior to have trezor and nanos?  I don't understand why think Coinbase is so different than Bitfinex or Kraken.
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:50:52
"Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated. Therefore, the Commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act." Believe me, I would like to believe you but it is not the case. Otherwise the market would be crazy by now.
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:08:57
Just sell your b2x before it drops and buy more btc. Don't be like all the bcash holders. They didn't sell after the fork when it was around 600 and now it is only worth 300. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:29:32
I agree, but what about right now. LN being a requirement for mass adoption makes btc for the next 1-4 years unusable in the retail market.
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:08:33
Are you crazy? I don't care that my bank doesn't give me my original bills back. I know my money is in my bank account, I now I can use a debit card, and I know I can walk into a bank and withdraw it.  How the fuck are going to be your own back with bitcoin? Are you going to lend yourself money? Are you going to travel the world with cash on hand because you don't want to use a bank's debit/credit card? I bet you are still getting paid USD because you are to scared to get paid in BTC (through one of the services - like bitwage).
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:38:33
40% only!!! I will be a year already. It will take us another year to be at 100%. How many years for LN to be massibly adopted.

So you don't trust the bank for your cash but you do trust them for your private keys?  I am done here. Have a great 4th :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:13:40
Holding since 2013 would have given you 5000% to 10000% returns. There is no way you could have made more gains than that in the last two months unless you are margin trading at 20x leverage. What exchange are you using that offers that kind of leverage.
@_date: 2018-07-03 02:58:32
Coinbase is secure though. You are more likely to lose your keys or get your pass phrase stolen by someone hacking your computer than Coinbase getting hacked.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:52:00
True. I forgot about the U.S restriction. What would happend if you do it now? will they convert your bt1 to btc before the fork? BTW, I do trust Bitfinex, they learned their lesson the hard way. It is by far the exchange with the most security features. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:00:19

It is more decentralized than mining that is for sure.

All Bitcoin debit card vendor report to the IRS. All exchanges report to the IRS. You will need to spend it locally if you want to successfully and illegally evade taxes. This is why Bitcoin has a bad rep. People like you simply trying to avoid taxes.

@_date: 2018-07-31 13:47:21
I am sorry for your loss. I've lost so much money in crypto since January that not selling in January will be far be my worst investment mistake in my life. On the bright side, the more money I lost the closer  and more attached I would feel towards my wife and my newborn. Because you know that it doesn't matter how much money you lose, your family will always be there for you. So Everytime the market goes down or you start  thinking about the 3 btc you lost, send a simple "I love you"  text to your wife, your priorities in life will become clear once she responds to your text. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:30:17

Move all your btc to bitfinex. Split it for bt1 and bt2. Sell all the bt2 and buy more btc. Your bt1 will convert to btc after the fork. That is what you should do if you believe b2x will not succed. I just did it and got an extra 17% free btc.

You buy and hold. That is it. You can be better at holding than the guy next to you. It will come a point where (I hope) that btc goes us up significantly that it will not be fun money. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:41:28
Bt2 is most likely more valuable now than b2x. (Bt2 is b2x prefork). People are realizing that b2x is shit, that is why bt2 is dropping in value. It's better to sell now bt2 than to wait for the fork and sell b2x for a couple bucks.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:45:15
So I can split my 1 btc into 1 bt2 and  1 bt2. Sell  the 1 bt2 for btc.  Split the new btc for bt1 and bt2. At the end, I am going to have a bunch of bt1 and no bt2 (that is okay) then on november, all my bt1 will convert to btc. Did I get it right?
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:02:33

@_date: 2018-07-03 03:04:44
lol, you are one of those "I am here for the tech" you are funny. Do you mind explaining custodial exchanges are a problem? Do you have any idea how many people have been hacked using MEW? A lot more than Coinbase. Actually the closes I've been to getting hacked was using EtherDelta which is completely decentralized. Anyways, good luck with the "reinvention of global trust and world change". Keep it up. Bitcoin has made a lot of progress in the last 9 years. Is is funny that you are blaming the only custodial exchange that hasn't been hacked.

Which we all now it will not collapse. Any government  could sink bitcoin if they wanted. The US govt couldnpump it to $1,000,000 and Inna few year later dump it all and cause a mayor crash blaming how bitcoin is  so easy to manipulate, just like the US has caused the collapsed of other Latin American countries (example).
