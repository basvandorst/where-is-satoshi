And we still have fiat currency as well. An economic collapse with the magnitude to make the dollar or euro worthless will equally make bitcoin worthless.
@_date: 2018-09-11 08:09:34
You need to account for the fact that we might not even see another bull market. It changes the risk/reward balance significantly.
@_date: 2018-09-11 08:04:21
Not long ago we used to say "one month" or "three months". Eventually that "one year ago" will have to be scratched too. When we get into November/ December with this market, it will paint a grim picture.  Looking at the past it's not a sensible strategy.

Ahh the good ole "bubble chasing", AKA getting people into bankruptcy since 1637

I’m confused. Which way is up?
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:17:25
1 BTC is still 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:14:18
I remember when these messages used to say "last month" and "three months ago". 
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:15:39
And 4.000 in 5 weeks.
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:12:22
If the last couple of months have teached us something maybe it's not to say these kinds of things...
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:21:47
Look around you. Almost nobody is using it for transactions, all the discussions about lightning are dead... this is now a bunch of hodlers hoping they don't lose money and marginal action due to BTC being a proxy between alt-coins and fiat. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:46:45
it was not (not bad either, just didn't have any effect whatsoever)
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:21:39
Oh, it adds up. Happy to clarify. What part is the one you don’t understand?
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:48:26
Neither has the world economy stopped working because of the Visa failure. Visa is not money. It’s just a transfer system. This is not much different than an exchange failing for a couple of hours.
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:35:07
From the infrastructure standpoint, they are. Visa payments are processed through a network of data centers and partner systems all around the world. For example: in Europe, yesterday, Spain had no problems because payments with Visa are routed through a bank owned system called Redsys. In the US, Visa has a network of processing servers and two data centers with multiple redundancies to prevent that a single failure brings down the whole payment system.
Yes, Visa is not centralized, it’s all owned by one corporation. And yes, a peer to peer system can be more resilient. But we need to stop pretending that Visa is somehow fragile. It’s quite robust when you consider the mount of transactions they do every second.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:46:02
Visa has plenty of redundancies (it’s the reason why this is only affecting Europe, for example). They can still fail at some point, but until we have a BTC blockchain that can process 200000 transactions per second at a low cost better not point fingers to specks in others peoples eyes. 
And this is not much different than an exchange failing for a couple of hours. BTC as a system might not be affected, but same can be said about fiat as a whole. People in Europe have bought stuff today with other cards, cash, transfers...
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:39:32
Also Mastercard users, Amex users, discover users, cash users, PayPal users, square users...
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:52:33
They process around 24000 transactions per second and have very few failures. It does sound like redundancies, but sometimes shit happens. Keep in mind, also, that not 700 million people were affected. It only happened on certain countries in Europe.
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:57:42
Do not use bitfinex as a proxy for the whole market. It's not representative.
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:38:50
I did. And it’s not ridiculous. We can stop pretending this was some kind of miracle that will make the world finally realize that BTC is superior. It was a glitch on a payment system that prevented some transactions to go through for a couple of hours. Tabloid headlines won’t change that fact.
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:46:52
Visa actually has a more mixed system than we think it does. In some countries it has partner processing companies. Spain, yesterday. Did not suffer the outage because of this. All visa payments are routed through a different network called Redsys. But yeah, I was not implying redundancy and decentralization are the same. Just that Visa has safeguards in place to account to the inherent fragility of a centralized system, same as BTC has mechanisms to prevent the pitfalls that come from decentralized systems.

Well, let me go out on a limb and say that it won't rise to 10K tomorrow.

Around 6 billion, according to research at JP Morgan.

That's for all crypto in any case.

It was pretty easy, actually. Not much different than today if you had a good email client and not terribly complicated if you had to use command line interface.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:09:32
There's a reason for that. Unlike stocks, it's difficult to establish what is the fair price bitcoin. Companies have cash reserves, balance sheets and revenue. Their prices on stock market reflect this and allows to predict how low can the value go. 
Bitcoin? a significant drop might be nothing or might be the end, who the hell knows?
Listen, behind these news agencies there are people like you and me, and I'd bet chances are that they are more prepared,  have more experience following markets and are more intelligent than you and me. Combined.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:56:36
Nope, it does not. Anecdotal means... anecdotal. There used to be a lot of mining around the middle of last year but most of it is gone now do to government pressure (and in this case, "a lot of" comes from comparing to neighboring countries. Venezuela has 31 million people, the vast majority does not use crypto). 
Other than a couple of specific few cases (the very definition of anecdotal) most of the real state transactions happen either on bolivars or on dollars or euros through foreign bank accounts.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:44:26
In an apocalyptical scenario, i'd probably prefer to exchange my leftover chicken for bullets, clothes or potatoes rather than gold. 
Gold and silver are ok, as they are somewhat easily divisible, hard to come by and rust-resistant but you need some level of social stability to easily and securely exchange it. 
Bitcoin requires such a level of infrastructure development (electricity, electronics, communications...) that it will be completely useless. Even if somehow the blockchain survives and it's restarted without no one tampering with (unlikely), it will take a long time before you can turn any part of it into something useful.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:31:55
That is ridiculous. Of course they do. You, as a private investor, might not directly own in your portfolio a specific share of a specific company because brokers use investing pools, but every share of every company is accounted for. It sucks when you are trying to change brokers but the system, as a whole, has every share accounted for.
This is like saying "nobody knows if your bitcoin transaction has gone through for a week" because its simply not reflected on the blockchain yet or your lightning node has not consolidated all the transfers. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:54:51
You have at least to entertain the possibility and prepare a strategy if that is the case..
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:53:01
Stop trying to attach market behavior to specific news items, FUD or not. This is a classic mistake also in stock analysis. That's not how chaotic systems work. 
Yes, good and bad news have an impact but not in a straightforward way. You cannot pin this last fall to a single story or a bunch of them, even. Markets are complex and move based on thousands of reasons. Some are clearly visible, some are not.
We are in the middle of downtrend and it's possible that it will continue for a while. That doesn't mean every single thing that happens is responsible for it or that the market is reacting to it. Same goes for when (or if) this ship turns around. People will try to attach positive stories to it to piece together a narrative, while ignoring the bad ones.  
The market is reacting to itself, nothing more, nothing less. It's bear time. Compounded by the fact that it's difficult to know what is the "fair value" of BTC ($1000, $100, $1,000,000, $1?). Deal with it however you can (Hodling, exiting and coming back or exiting for good and cutting your losses), but try to do it rationally.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:20:10
Yep, and some still do bolivar nontheless: 
For other cases, there's always an option to do these transactions on euro or dollar through different "non-governmet sanctioned" avenues.
Bitcoin use is growing but remains anecdotal.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:58:32
But your investment doesn’t help bitcoin be revolutionary. It’s not a company that needs revenue or investors. It will be revolutionary wether you invest on it or not.  
... So why did you invest?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:59:44


No it's not. if you know the market is volatile the best strategy is get out while you are ahead, get back in when it goes down. This is investment 101. Hodling is an extremely inefficient way to manage your assets. Any broker will tell you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:40:59


How valuable? Seriously. I think there's a lot of merit on the blockchain technology but  BTC is not the only way to implement it and there's no IP or patent on it so anyone can use their own implementation. 
So I'd really like to know the reasoning behind the idea that Bitcoin is valuable and, more important, a specific value attached to it.

McAfee has played this community since day 1. And probably sold weeks ago.

Food for thought: Lotteries and gambling are highly regulated markets, more so than start-ups. That's why there's no burden on the consumer to access them.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:14:04
I cannot think of a better example on how this will en badly than the last two months.
Let's put it this way. It was possible to do it since dec but now its easier to bet on the future of BTC without holding any real BTC. The ride it's about to turn wilder.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:09:14
Don't think its too bullish, tbh. 
They say they are willing to regulate if lawmakers decide to do so but that's been more or less the same attitude the SEC has had for the last 6 months and any regulation will probably scare some bitcoin users away.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:51:39
Agreed. It's a good time to sell.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:02:39
It’s almost like you cannot trust what they say.

Shorting BTC in the last couple of weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:13:36
This doesn't explain how this situation is better to current one. Banks are really happy with the current state of affairs. 
And they can improve on the system keeping it centralized or even apply all the good parts (for them) of the blockchain technology without ever touching a single bitcoin.

Not yet. It looks better than previous days but could still go down easily. You want more volume to feel like you are in the clear.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:56:32
Based on what, exactly?
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:19:55
Weak hands are precisely the ones that remain in the market right now. Investing is not easy and emotions can get the best of you. It takes guts and a firm hand to know when to cut your losses and when to enter the game again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:10:03
Probably better than his crypto...

@_date: 2018-02-06 12:40:41
it "went back up" so many times in the last month...
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:47:47
unlikely, but it seems that price is finally stabilizing and that's a good start.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:58:39
Yep, that’s how it works. And the DTC is required, by law (and it is audited for) to have the aggregate number of shares of all the participants. The share is not in your name (unless you opt for direct registration) but it is assigned to you in the DTC books.  Federal regulations require brokerage firms to hold their clients' securities in separate accounts.
There is a risk, obviously, and once you start looking at the derivates market there is a bigger potential for things to go wrong if the whole system collapses. But for an individual investor, owning shares of Apple or Walmart is a very safe proposition. And the risk of owning them with or without direct registration is pretty much the same.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:46:16
Yep, as soon as possible. There will always be ways to recover your investment and then some if the trend changes.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:49:58
So what happened to being deregulated as one of BTC virtues?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:50:28
From people that already have an account on other exchanges and are looking for a cheaper alternative. Those are not new buyers.
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:21:09
I'm no expert but i'd say it's probably not going to happen...
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:49:05
Wants to go up, but there's a lot of pressure. Volume is not where it needs to be. BUT so far, in the last couple of weeks, this has been one of the few instances where it kinda somewhat looks like it could find a bottom so here's hoping.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:08
There is no support a $7000 from a technical analysis viewpoint. Next one after $7500 is around $5000. Hope you like ketchup.

Any volatile investment  would be at risk. That includes crypto.

@_date: 2018-07-02 09:38:05
I'd say stocks -&gt;  housing -&gt; bonds -&gt; bitcoin from a pure investment vehicle point of view. Housing would go up a spot if you consider its inherent utility as a place to live and don't buy it exclusively for speculation.
I know you are trying to make the case that Bitcoin is better but:
A- We don't know at this time if it's near bottom.
B- Unless you can time it right or are planning to HODL until the end of times (in that case, what's the point?), it has been historically a very risky investment not really tied to anything valuable or unique. 
Bitcoin should be a coin, not an investment. I know it's not a popular opinion around here, but I firmly believe so.
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:17:51
Don't be ridiculous. i'm not saying that because I believe Bitcoin should be only a currency, that means magically people will stop using it as an investment vehicle. I just gave my two cents worth of what are the best investment options of all those named. If you want a sound investment advice, bitcoin should only be a footnote in your investment portfolio, regardless of what the price is. 
But hey, It's my opnion. If you think differently, good for you. Godspeed.
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:37:52

No they are not. There might be one or two cases, but it's not widespread and never will. Why would I sell you a house in BTC if the morning after I'm going to lose 10% of its value?
