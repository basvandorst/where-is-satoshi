He just revealed what he is doing ... he has 250K in BTC = $2.5 Million USD if he rallies the market to $10USD/btc.  THEN he cashes out to USD ... he said he can take the market to $1USD/btc ... see the logic yet ... He will have $2.5Million in USD and will owe $250k+7% interest to his depositors but in bitcoins (worth a $1) ... pretty cool trick

**Order of types of Money**
1. BASE = metals &amp; other hard durables
2. CERTIFICATES = claim checks on the base valued objects
3. IOUs = bank account credits = central bank dollars = USD, GBP, YEN, XDRs, CHF, EURO 
BITCOIN is in the later category ... the operative word is ... *credit* ... see *belief* &amp; *faith*
The economic crash is the crushing of faith in of the IOU category ... and most all institutions of the CERTIFICATE category ... (btw...any good vault/warehouse company that can stand and deliver will survive and thrive this coming cash crash).

well time is relative, when defining short and long units.  
if you are investing ... common sense would suggest if you are in for the LONG then hold something that maintains a consistent quality ... so yes gold having the quality of being  chemically inert ... makes it a *natural* choice ... it could be said bitcoins are also chemically inert, static string of data (encrypted).
But this does not make BTC "predictably useful when retrieved" at a later time, stress on *useful*, the idea that the good is perpetually in demand in the market because of intrinsic value.
Chicken or wheat can be a store value long term, if you apply the alchemy of rolling over (swapping) future contracts.  In these schemes allow ownership of a commodity that is of a fixed quality in the LONG, but practically the investment is eroded by service fees.

Yes.  My premise that in order to act as a store of value, a commodity must have a non-monetary use.  
Think of things you would actually go into a store (market) and trade some thing you have (another valuable) for that thing.

*agreeing with the aboves*
Fiat money system requires a lender of last resort that has the *magical* power to arbitrarily increase the money supply, when the biggest bankers are over leveraged.  
A mythical BTC Central Bank can not bailout any BTC member banks once leverage exceeds actual BTC on the *supply* chain.  And yes  banks would be smart to be very highly capitalized ... like 90% held in reserve.  Banks should return back to the primary business of keeping safe vaults (secure encrypted eWallets).  
If you seek better returns on your bitcoins then invest in BTC based stock shares, this already exists btw.
IMO ... there is no need for fictional reserve BTC money lending ... if you want to borrow BTC then issue a note fixed in $$$ ... then buy bitcoins on the exchange ... do your business in bitcoin ... cash out back into $$$ ... and repay the outstanding note in $$$.   Advantage to the borrower ... the fiat money will suffer inflation while the bitcoin will suffer deflation.

As of my understanding so far ... this is the near Future layout of the *Bitcoin Universe*
**A.  - the OT network** :: an open decentralized  server network, for instant P2p BANKING, seems to promise "low trust" but less hackable platform for writing financial instruments.  *The key is coins move faster than on the miner based transactions.*  Some how some way you will be able to make real BTC deposits, like at the beginning of your day and then withdraw at the end of the day to house the bitcoins yourself.  My guess is that 2 types will like this platform::  
cyberpnks ((super concerned about being anon))
bitcoin intercommerce B2B ((business owners that work within the BTC economy as much as they can :: they need REAL TIME commercial banking like solutions))
 
**B. - the REAL bitcoin banks** :: coming soon secure &amp; trusted layers of vault storage, may have to go thru several *poof and its gone* mtGox/mybitcoin type of events before anyone service provider gets there, they will also face the wrath of government law enforcement and likely will be subject to WWW3 type cyberattacks.
**C. - the bitcoin eCommerce Economy** :: this is where you buy things with them coins.  Security is not really an issue, but establishing trusted merchants and growth of multiple economy sectors is key.
**D. - eWallets** :: online apps that let you store small amounts of BTC, basically you store only your daily allowance here.  likely sits on your mobile device
**E. - client on PC** :: security is dependant on *YOU* ; rumour is that updated versions will help with encryption &amp; preventions ... but only a fool would hold more than a weeks pay on the working *wallet.dat* 
**F. - the money exchangers** :: gettin fiat money exchanged into BTC, *visa versa*, lots of players making money off of money, well maybe just one so far ... *cough* ... Gox ...  ... *cough* ... Key is easy to put cash in and pull cash out, right now it's so-so.  Likely need more small amount providers (for the n00bs) ... using google.checkout or taking wired bank payments.
**G. - offline storage** :: security is dependant on *YOU* ;  lots of easy solutions ... key is really deleting the original from your online PC ... I am envisioning lots of USB sticks worth more than their weight in gold.
**H. - the big Bad banks** :: aka the enemy ... the goal is getting them back into their original business of Vault keeping ... that should be easy :/ 
... perhaps the majority of BTC participants will also cluster together with bank accounts on the same banking networks ... so far ... Citybank&amp;WellsFargo / ING Direct / Dwolla ... all allow very cheap intrabanking. 
**I. - the P2P sys Admins** :: aka the unsung heroes ... the guys coding the source (Dev), the guys building mining rig pools (the network), the guys creating network healthy monitors &amp; reporting transaction details and mining data 
@_date: 2011-08-29 19:51:23


Good point.  My guess is that in the short term this is true.  But in the long term most BTC will circulate and you can track them via the block-explorer. 
if there are 6000k BTCs in existence and only 50k being circulated over the exchanges daily ... this means less than 1% of BTCs are flowing (or floating) ... the rest are locked up in vaults.

I think it would be interesting to know how many BTC just simply vanish from the bitcoin economy? 
Certainly there is a natural % loss due to crashed/broken PC hardware etc.

and Bitcoin exists just the same.  You can exchange it for other goods.  
My guess is that you are referring to the "legal tender" aspect of central bank notes (but even this feature is specifically limited within the juris diction of the originating nation).

until you realize that 800 BTC could never be paid back because they do not exist ... the BTC money supply never expands (once the 21 million coins are minted).  Theoretically it does not work.
Check your fact also ... the gold standard idea was a 19^th C. British invention to peg paper bank notes against gold held on deposit ... the actual era of the American gold exchange standard was 1870–1914 ... Bankers basically run a naked short ... they calculate the risk of selling what they borrowed in the hopes that they get paid before the loan (your money) is called in ... if they screw up then they need to borrow more from some one holding a bigger pile of gold.
