Thank you so much for the detailed response. This is going to be the route I go. Sounds pretty effin' secure to me!

Do you have to have an account with BofA in order to make the deposit?

Thank you for your insightful metaphor, surely a great submission of our time.

Do it. You'll have your whole life to acquire $5000, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.

Can't you just wire money directly to Mt. Gox through your bank?

Do you know of any other good tutorials?

So you like the red pill? I'm confused by your post...
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:34:45
Yes I have. Nothing crazy, but enough for me to care about. If you're worried about losing your money then spend half.

Based on your psychic intuition? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:14:58
Great info, thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-25 02:39:15
Make it happen!

Upvote because I'm choosing to believe he's trolling.

I think you're missing the point. It just seems unprofessional, and definitely does more damage than good. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:18:14
Wow fantastic post! This is really an informative contribution to the community!

I haven't tried yet either. I am currently planning on buying a much larger amount of BTC than I first did, so I am trying to find out which method will be most cost effective. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:53:11
Wow, thank you for this wonderful new perspective.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:37:43
I'm almost positive I'm going to use Bitfloor and then just transfer to Gox. If I remember, I'll let you know how it goes.

Someone really needs to put a list together of items similar to that TV.

Thanks for this great post!
I am currently looking to invest a more serious amount of my fiat into Bitcoin, but stories like the one about people losing 10s of thousands of dollars are motivating me to take the safest approach to storage.
This will be a long-term investment for me and I want to keep about 90% of my assets in cold storage. The security technique that sounds the most appealing to me is having a separate computer to hold my coins. I am still not exactly sure as to how I should go about this. I would consider myself technologically inclined, but definitely no expert. If someone could write/send me to a "cold storage for dummies" guide with regard to using a secondary computer I would highly appreciate it. Thanks in advance!

I hope you sell the shit out of those bags.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:09:18
Damn, never thought of it like that. Wow! All it does is make me smile haha
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:20:05
Man...I was so ready to hate you. Got me good!
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:09:36
Thanks, I think this article does a very good job of simplistic explanation.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:25:23
Unfortunately, there has never been anything like this in the history of ever, so you are purely speculating. There is no evidence of anything.
