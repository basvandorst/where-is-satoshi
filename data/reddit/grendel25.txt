Buying other coins isn't necessarily a scam activity.  Doge, Litecoin, and others have utility.  Some online retailers accept Doge and Litecoin as digital currency which encompasses the same rationale to value that Bitcoin has.

The Bitcoin Redemption

My 2-cents:
1.  They make physical coins that serve as a way to access the virtual bitcoins but you would have to access the virtual currency through some electronic device such as a computer or kiosk.  More and more, there are physical components of bitcoin that you can touch and feel but ultimately it's a transaction executed virtually as are many fiat transactions for the past several decades.
2.  Dogecoins are just as 'real' as bitcoins.  Dogecoins are different from Bitcoins in that they are a different mathematical algorithm that are resistant to ASIC mining process used for bitcoin mining.  Dogecoin, Litecoin, and many other 'alt' coins are more profitable to mine with conventional methods such as video cards.
3.  Yes, it's worth it.  It has too much traction to simply fade away.  The trifecta of recent detriments is showing the current resiliency of digital currency.

I def side with the OP.  This post highlighted a serious security flaw and people should be thankful to aphextron for promoting awareness.  Not just awareness of this one online service but for any business service.

I'm happy the foundation sent the letter.  However, the grammar and composition needs improvement.  The foundation should really consider implementing an editing process when corresponding professionally.

Bitcoin Begins

I agree but my question was also highly irrational. Miners aren't going away.  But, is still good to have perspective of the value of mining. Even when bitcoin is all mined out there will be other coins but the value of bit coin may remain as long as...well as long as it is still valued.

Gone with the Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:29:01
This is America.  Government for the people by the people.  It only makes sense for people to engage the government.  Cable companies want to charge for a service and then charge additional costs for access to a service they already provide you.  It's just a new and inventive way for them to make money and it would pervert the free internet we have today.

I agree and have had similar thoughts.  Mostly on comp sci but also on economics.

Full Metal Bitcoin

I agree that it's a risky venture but it's also important to consider the profoundness of the current situation.  Some govt's oppose, some govt's encourage.  Some businesses oppose while others encourage.  If recent history has taught us anything it's how divisive humanity can be rather it be politics or economics.  Bitcoin has gotten to where it is today because of the existing supporters and while newcomers may side with their Apple brand influences it is just as likely that Bitcoin supporters (who were also Apple lovers) could drop Apple and continue their passion with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin won't just go away and there are significant retailers (Overstock, Tiger Direct recently) who are contributing to further entrenchment of Bitcoin.
