I use both, but I last minute chose Coinbase so I didn't have to wait the 3-5 days to move my funds out of my bank account.  Currently working on moving it over to Pro after my funds aren't on hold anymore (6 days):P

Yes if I use CB and get set to sell, it doesn't sell at the current price.  It's always a bit under as well.  Classy move, Coinbase.

I was blaming myself.  You seem like a fun guy to be around.

Just checking in again to make sure you know this post was stupid.

It got down to the 7,600's yesterday and recovered just fine.  But yeah, go ahead and sell lol

I'm assuming the tax gig you're referring to isn't applicable in the US?

I actually agree (mostly) with this post.  Except I believe the time frame you have is significantly shorter than ~~what you posted~~.  Time will tell.
edit: What I expect.

The $200 Coinebase fee... pal.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:00:06
Well it was $100 to buy and will be roughly $100 to sell.  I don't know what the percentage is.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:04:49
Yeah I think I remember that. Coinbase is the only option I knew of where I could instantly withdraw from my bank account though. So I took the fee hit and went with it.
