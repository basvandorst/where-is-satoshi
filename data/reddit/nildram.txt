Similar, but it's a way more subtle reference. The block chain is a core part of the Bitcoin protocol. The coinbase is a much more minute part of the whole scheme. It's not going to confuse nearly so many people.

I think in the case of hardware, open spec would mean that it is built to meet the specifications, but the exact designs, materials, methods of assembly, and possibly also firmware used to create the product are not made publicly available, thus not open source. 
I assume you could test the product to verify that it meets the spec, but reverse engineering it would be up to you.

This.  I've seen so much of what appears to be almost harassment.  This community can be as circle jerky as it wants on r/bitcoin, but when we go out and prod companies and charities as if they owe it to us to accept Bitcoin, we do ourselves no favors. 
Aside from a short term bump, I also doubt that it would be worth it for the WMF if they expect $500K to make a new payment gateway worthwhile. 
If someone in the bitcoin world wants to raise $500k worth of Bitcoin for the WMF, that might make a case however.  It could be done using M-of-N. A framework has been though out to some extent as well on the Bitcoin 100 thread:

Honestly, I don't blame them at all. They're focus is on maximizing donations to their very valuable service, not promoting Bitcoin. 
Every element of that banner has been scrutinized, and the choice of payment methods has been very heavily thought through. I wouldn't be surprised if a small number of users actually do see the bitcoin option. 
You can see their past testing and optimization process detailed [here]( and most recently 
Bitcoin will make it's way to a prominent form of donation when people start using it for that.

That's true. But it's still the thin edge of the wedge slipping in ever further. It's a precedent for large, slow moving companies doing something pretty drastic. Despite not being "a-level", they are probably a couple of the highest grossing companies to ever accept bitcoin.
It also creates knowledge amongst real corporate CFOs, accountants and lawyers in how to deal with Bitcoin. These lawyers attend peer groups like "Silicon Valley Accountants Meetups". Some of them will be able to share their experiences with accountants and lawyers in other companies, and lessen the fear. 
It's a step, and a pretty big one, regardless of how "hot" these co's are by perception.

"if someone breaks in and tries to initiate a withdrawal (even knowing their private key) this will give them time to act and transfer to a safe address, even cold storage if need be. It would look a lot like this commercial. An app on your phone or computer would notify you of an outgoing transaction. Did you authorize this? Yes or no. Theft prevented."
I like this part, I think it's a good idea. 
The simple "delay on coins going out" doesn't seem to add much value. I suspect that there is a need for companies willing to play a "bank like" role.  Escrow will become a more seamless part of many bitcoin transaction. Bitpay and coinbase will be asked to play a more active role in mediation. 
Coinbase is particularly well suited to this, as they actually hold many peoples coins, much like a bank. So could simply decide to reverse a transaction. 
*Please notice that I haven't said that this is a good thing or a bad thing.
The upside of this, is that the oversite and mediation is optional between buyers and sellers.

To anyone about to downvote OPs text post, simply because it questions the sanctity of Satoshi's Plan... please consider how religious you really want to be about Bitcoin.
I'm not a miner, and I'm not incredibly well versed in mining economics, but having people like you doing this kind of thinking, and sharing it with the network is very important.  
Though it would probably be a "massive amount" of power, that power exists. 
I've heard lately that the network hashrate is currently equal to the 500 largest super computers on earth.  That's pretty impressive, but it also means you only need 250 super computers. It's absurd but the edge cases are important.
In fact, if serbia decided to redirect it's military spending towards a network attack, it could do it. 
Add to that the recent "selfish miner" scheme, and your idea, which I can't poke any holes in except the "massive" amount of computation required, and the risks are very real.

So, again, really cool service. The chrome extension sounds ingenious. 
That said, here was my experience:
1) I figured, "let's try this out, I'm sure there's a book I want to buy"
2) I wanted to buy this book:  I'm in Canada. Didn't see any indication that that's a problem on your site. The book is 26 CAD, cool.
3) Run through your system, enter all the information, get to the bitpay button... "you want .44 btc?"  That doesn't sound right.
4) OIC, you're charging me the 42 CAD list price, not the discount, which is 37% off. 
I assume this is either a bug, or just the best you can do according to whatever arrangement (or lack thereof) that you have with Amazon. 
Naturally it's a deal breaker though, and it makes me hesitant to try again with another book. 
I'd be less hesitant if your form saved my data on refresh, but it doesn't.

Right, but this is the beauty of a short term deal.  Over the course of several deals, the fluctuations amount to a random walk, except with a reset to neutral at the beginning of each deal.  So the expected value of loss/gain due to fluctuation is minimal.
There is also strong value behind the statement that selling at a fixed BTC price gives.

These are really good points. 
I think the thing is, that although bitcoin should one day aspire to be stodgy, boring and reliable, it still is the wildwest.  People who buy and use bitcoin know that, and I think most people live with the fact that they could be worthless tomorrow. 
The startup mentality does work with the culture, and it will mature alongside bitcoin.  Paypal was a scrappy start up once upon a time. So was Google. They moved fast, and they broke stuff, less so these days. 
I think your analogy to modern day banking is a bit off too... they move fast, break stuff, and fuck others over. 
Bitcoin is not so much more risky than modern day banking, the difference is that the users know the risks and live with them.

I believe language is really important, so I appreciate your feedback. I too really think that bitcoin is a beneficial thing. I agree that "hooked" has it's roots in some negative situations, but I don't think it necessarily maintains them. 
These are the things that google most closely associates with "hooked on _____"  
-"a feeling"
-"fta" (which is due to hookedonfta.com, a discount electronics seller)
ref:  
About this: "Nice subtle promo for your deal on the paperwallet kit,"... is that sarcasm? My intent is to add value rather than just being all salesy, but if it looks scammy, lemme know.

How's that working for you? ie. is gold a significantly better experience?
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:52:21
Well... no one that lays out enough to purchase 50% of all the bitcoin in the world is going to want to see that value collapse. 
Also, the effort to acquire that much bitcoin would significantly increase the value of the bitcoin.
It seems like a reason to buy in more than it does to be cautious.
@_date: 2013-11-04 13:56:48
For me, it's about 10 BTC.  But why would I keep anything over 1 or 2 BTC in hot storage for spending anyways?
I'd say it depends on risk profile, and how you actually use it.

This is a very fun idea! We would need to coordinate to hit a single subreddit strategically for sure for this to be felt.
Something with a focused user group, that would talk amongst themselves excitedly, then vote it up and spread it around.  
Would be too incestuous?
A subreddit that targets small business owners would be perfect!

You'll need to use the same email address you used on check out to get your shirt. At that time you'll need to choose your size (or sizes), enter your shipping address and pay the shipping fee.  You can also add some of their other awesome shirts to your order at the time.

Bitstamp really isn't a wallet, but an exchange. 
I put my coins there when I want to trade them, but I keep them in my BlockChain.Info wallet, which is considered as having the strongest security among the online wallets. 
A significant challenge for me though is that I keep my USD in bitstamp, because I'm in Canada, and moving CAD into and out of bitcoin isn't easily done. If I decided to cash out entirely, I would buy BTC on bitstamp, transfer to cavirtex and then transfer to a Canadian bank. 
I'm not at all familiar with Coinbase.

Seems like a good sign, honesty transparency, etc.

@_date: 2013-08-26 17:55:11
I honestly think that bitpay would be simpler for this basic application, particularly using their "My Catalog Items" feature.
You can just enter a price, add some custom fields and get emailed whenever a transaction occurs.
Upside: no programming aside from pasting the button codeinto your site's HTML.
Downside: if you do a high volume of transactions, this method doesn't allow for an easily readable export of your transactions, so you need to read the emails/addresses individually. 
I've written what I hope is a fairly balanced comparison here: 
One important distinction: Coinbase charges for the conversion to fiat, but not the transaction. Bitpay charges for the transaction, but not the conversion to fiat and direct deposit, which they've automated.
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:21:13

BTclicks has been running ads, but disallows comments. 
Their login doesn't work, and the minimum payment is 0.5 btc. I'd rather not throw money into an abyss. Any experiences with them (preferably not from people who've only ever talked about btclicks).
What about coinurl.com? To be honest, I find their site confusing, and am not really sure what I'm getting, where I'd be advertising, how the targeting works.

About time. I'm tired of seeing inaccurately inflated prices all over the web.

I like what bitpay does: poll Gox, Bitstamp and BTC-E, throw out the outlier and take the average of the other two. 
Bitcoin average  looks like they're really onto something too.

Another forum that you might find helpful:
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:34:51
That's probably not a good idea, because you break the "promise" of 21 million,  and you'd need to do it every time the price multiplies by 100.
My understanding however, is that you could further subdivide a satisfied, in a similar fashion to you suggestion. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 18:53:36
Not to excuse them, they do look shady.
Is it a SCAM as in they take your money and you get nothing?

Actually, a very interesting approach, requiring an inconsequential amount of bitcoin for an upvote.   
There's some potential here.  The main barrier that I see, is the effort required to open up a wallet, or pull out a phone and send the bitcoin for the vote. 
It adds a fair bit of friction.
I would suggest asking people to keep .01 btc in a wallet that you host, so that they can easily upvote and drawdown that balance.

Yes, refunds are a pain in the ass.   I tried including a field to specify a refund address at checkout. That seemed to work until an incorrect address was entered and the entire refund was lost.

Hi cthompsonguy.
Coinforest is totally new, but Shirtoshi has been around for a while. 
We use bitpay to process our transactions, which provides at least an avenue for oversight. 
So it would be quite unlikely that we would last long enough as a scammer to make the effort which has gone into this worthwhile. 
Beyond that, I would really appreciate if you could suggest any other ways of making our site look more legit.

NO way, in fact DPR will be a new poster child for the underground economy. 
That said, with bitcoin, any publicity is good publicity.  Once you have some, you can never not have had some, and you begin to get it. 
Then you begin to want the price to go up. Then you're in.

Totally true, as well as lots of link-building opportunies on bitcoin business listings.  The thing I'd be worried about is any business expecting a huge in flow of bitcoiners desperate to spend their BTC anywhere.  
I think that's a common misconception, where the truth is that most bitcoiners have probably never spent a bitcoin on anything other than mining shares or USD in day trading.

A few notes about this:
[The Bitcoin 100]( has been working on this for a while now.  I believe they've contact some pretty major charities, and have offered an extra bounty.
I agree with your sentiment, and thought it would be interesting to sweet the pot further. 
I (via [Coin Forest]( run group buy deals, in an effort to expand Bitcoin.  I wanted to try to tweak this model to sweet the pot even further. 
I leveraged a connection to submit this proposal to a major charity:










The response back was "we don't have the bandwidth", and fair enough. I don't think that Bitcoin is really at the point yet where it's going to make much of a difference to these charities, and when it becomes mainstream, they can just add a Bitpay button, no problem. 
I've moved on too.

OP here. 
1. The EFF logo in the posting was poor form on my part. 
It was just the image that reddit grabbed, it being the only one on the page, I tried to figure out how to to get rid of it, gave up and moved on. Not a reddit pro, obvi. If you can tell me how to get rid of it, I will.
2. Thanks for the feedback on the site design, and the fact that this looks like a con. That's good to know.
3. I really believe that a deals website would be great for bitcoin.  I'm working on a blog post for this, but essentially, I see it as being a great incentive for people to obtain bitcoin. 
Why use your USD, to buy BTC, to buy stuff that's priced to the equivalent USD? Short term deals seem like a good incentive to overcome that. 
Besides an Avalon rig, what would people actually be interested in purchasing?
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:22:17

At that volume, you'd likely qualify to invest in SecondMarket's new Bitcoin Investment Trust.

Annoy people by giving them money?
If we spread it out, the only people that will notice are the people that receive tips. 
By concentrating our efforts in a single subreddit, they will begin to talk amongst themselves and notice that it's happening.  We can also create a thread on their subreddit, declaring it "r/bitcoin visits r/startups" day, or something like that. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 14:48:07
Money is portable power.
That power can also be a force for good, and my obsession with bitcoin comes from the idea that just maybe the generosity I've seen already in some areas of the bitcoin community, enabled by it's effortless transmission, can be built upon.

@_date: 2013-09-17 15:30:57
I don't think bitpay is able to offer escrow currently, as they actually prefer to pay their merchants daily in order to avoid the security liability of holding too much BTC.
Though adding an escrow option onto their existing service would probably be a great advantage.

I've met much of the CaVirtex team, they're a really commited team. The CEO George, in particular has maneuvered through many near misses threatening to shut down the exchange.  
We're in a precarious situation in Canada, with only one really prominent exchange.  If CaVirtex shuts down in the middle of a rally, it's because CaVirtex really fucking NEEDS to shut down in the middle of a rally. Trust me, they want your fees as much as you want to make the trades.
So it's one thing that you're missing out on the action, but I'd rather they annoy a few people, and stay in business, than fuck up hugely, draw tons of attention to themselves, and get shut down.

There are significant delays to withdrawing your USD from Mt. Gox, with a lack of clarity around how long they should actually be.  You may never get that money back, and Gox hasn't been very transparent about it. 
Thus, the price is also factoring in 10-15 USD, to account for the risk that someone is taking by buying your dollars there. 
This risk has it's own value, which is not reflected on other exchanges.
I really like how [bitcoin average]( presents the current price, averaged across the volume at multiple exchanges.
Also, notice that they have a big fat button at the top, for the sole purpose of allowing you to ignore GOX.

My biggest concerns:
**Centralization** 
Particularly the power possessed by 5 developers who have commit privileges. It seems that even if the network didn't like what they were doing, it would be hard to get consensus on where to follow the updates from.
Mining too.  Aside from newbs willingness to buy USB miners, which won't last long, or be impactful even if it does.
**The Matthew effect** 
Amongst early adopters (of which we ALL still are), some of the earliest are actually starting to become quite wealthy. This seems to be more of the same as we have with the current system.
**Too succesful** 
What happens when Bitcoin wins? Yes, we're all rich. But if the dollar goes into free fall (not only by Bitcoin's doing naturally), that leaves a lot of our friends and loved ones on a wholly different (lower) playing field.
It also makes Bitcoin Too Big Too Fail, but harder to prevent.  The protocol may seem bullet proof, but the absence of evidence of a flaw isn't evidence of absence.

This is really the motivation behind coinforest. I won't link to avoid being spammy. But I wholeheartedly agree!  
Investing in bitcoin is highly speculative, not everyone is into that.
So, if you're not buying BTC to invest, what's the point? Anything you might want to buy is available in dollars, and any company accepting bitcoin, is just charging a number based on the current exchange rates. 
Our aim is to create temporary situations, where the only way to get that item, is by owning bitcoin.

Wait, aren't bonds more like mining contracts, meaning you're essentially leasing a certain number of GH/s for as log as those machines are active? Meaning your investment will depreciate over time with the equipment and the increasing difficulty?
