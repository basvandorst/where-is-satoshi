Palestinians that chose NOT to try and murder every Jew in Israel when the state was declared are now citizens of Israel.  Only 200,000 Palestinians were not allowed to return after they joined the war against Israel, which was 0.1% of the allotted land in the Middle East after the war.  Before the declaration, 50% of people living in Jerusalem were Jews living peacefully alongside Arab Muslims, but when the state was declared they decided they could not live with that.  Our history in the region can be traced thousands of years, and you try to make it seem as if we stole their land merely because they chose to leave their homes and try to push the Jews into the sea.

I'm a rails developer.  No matter what kind of web developer you are though, you will be expected to know HTML and CSS.  Most bitcoin startups involve the web.  It's unlikely OP would be in a position to work on the blockchain code or something after teaching himself some C++.  I have a computer science degree and work as a developer and bitcoin core code still confuses the hell out of me.  Frameworks like Rails can help him build things after teaching himself the basics, and he can create web applications that he never would have been able to alone.  I'd say Javascript is a lot more important thank HTML/CSS though, especially for Bitcoin.

Where do you live?  Check out the developer bootcamps like Dev Bootcamp, App Academy, Launch Academy, etc.  It is VERY difficult to teach yourself from scratch and get to the point where you could actually build something worthwhile.  Code academy is good for syntax but it doesn't teach you to think like a programmer.  A coding bootcamp can teach you in 3 months what would take you years to teach yourself.

We don't block trade, who told you that, some anti-Israel website?  The blockade is quite different than blocking trade.  You can find Palestinian products all over the world.  Ships are stopped at the blockade and then the goods are transferred by truck into/from Gaza, which I assume you're talking about.  Because there is no blockade in the west bank.

Nobody stole anything, if anything it was stolen from us to begin with.  And half of the people living there before '48 were Jews.

This is typical wave pattern and we're still in wave 2.  Fibonacci retracement levels could bring us down to 330 or even 290, but then it will reverse.  Buy when it starts to reverse for max profit.

They do have the right to vote, travel freely, and have land rights.  I think you're confusing Palestinians with Israeli Arabs.  Of course Palestinians that don't have Israeli citizenship can't vote, like any other country in the world.

Oh please, only 200,000 people were "kicked out" of Israel.  Do you know why?  Because they left their homes to join in the war against Israel by the Arab nations.  Any who waged war against Israel were not allowed to return.  Do you know why 20% of Israelis are Arab "Palestinians"?  Because they didn't wage war, and were allowed to stay in Israel, and enjoy full equal rights AND MORE RIGHTS AND FREEDOM THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!!!  Israel is 0.1% of the Middle East, and when the UN divided it up into Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, etc...all the Arab nations still weren't content with allowing the Jewish state to be born, even though half of the people living there were Jews.  Checkpoints?  The checkpoints are for people leaving Palestine and coming into Israel to work.  We allow them to do this to make more money!  The problem is, they often try to kill us after we let them in, so checkpoints are to make sure they don't have bombs.  Way worse than apartheid?  You're fucking disgusting.  You have no idea what apartheid was like at all.  No resources, economic opportunities, or basic rights?  First off, we provide them with FREE resources, including providing their electricity for free, we don't need to do that.  We're not their government.  Second, no economic resources?  You have obviously never seen Palestine.  It is not the junkyard that the media portrays it to be, and actually has a better economy than Egypt.  Basic rights?  That's not our fault.  They have their own governments.  You wanna talk about basic rights?  Hamas kills its citizens in Gaza if they dance in public because they think it's a sin.  You reek of antisemitism.

The exchange is two days old, of course there is low volume.  I have been using it and I have profited 20% in the past two days by taking advantage of having no fees, and I started AFTER it crashed from 300.  The only reason the price rose in the first place was because of Coinbase news, you can't blame them for it going back down after.  And if you had the slightest idea how to analyze charts you would have expected it.  I have been profiting the whole time, maybe YOU'RE the amateur.

It's working just fine.  Volatility doesn't scare me.  The price changing doesn't affect my life in the slightest, even if it went to $0 I'd be A-OK.  I wouldn't risk keeping my savings in btc if it could ruin me.  It's all a matter of what we think the price will be years from now, and I think it will be higher.  And until then, I don't care.  You sure sound like you're from buttcoin, and someone there linked to this.  Perhaps not selling at 1,200 got you butthurt.

Not people moving their coins, nor people that are spooked.  More worried about day traders that were frozen at 277 and haven't had a chance to trade since then.  A lot might be taking profit at current price.
@_date: 2015-01-30 12:43:49
It's quite easy, actually.  It's the bigger profits that are the tough ones.  When you have a lot of capital to play with, you can easily make hundreds or more any time the price moves by even a few dollars, which it does many times per day with Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:16:04
That would only be true if 100% of people that spend bitcoins rebuy all the bitcoins they spend.  Let's be real here.

I love how your argument is supported by so much evidence.  Palestinians have murdered seven of my friends.  How about you?  If they stopped attacking us, the fighting would end.  We offered them their state years ago when Olmert was PM.  Everything they wanted, we were even going to give them East Jerusalem.  They turned it down because they wanted millions of Palestinians to become Israeli citizens, not citizens of the new state of Palestine, which would obviously never be a part of any deal.  And then we pulled out of Gaza, kicked all the settlers out of their homes and dragged all the Jews out of Gaza, as an effort to make peace.  Instead, Gaza voted in Hamas and turned Gaza into a terrorist hub that attacked us EVERY DAY.  If you have never lived there, you don't have the right to criticize just because you saw some pictures on your left-wing blogs.

@_date: 2015-01-25 09:17:25
Got off track anyway, the point of all this was that holding does NOT drive down price.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:33:25
It's not that complicated, the price is affected the same way any currency's value is affected.  Except for the fact that much of bitcoin's value is based on FUTURE speculation.  It is not worth the current price right now, it is only at this price because people believe it will be more useful in the future, which I do as well.  The current price is because of all those speculators buying and holding.  How many of the active bitcoin users do you think actually use it as a day-to-day currency as opposed to investors?  
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:35:57
99% of merchants accepting bitcoin convert immediately to USD upon payment.  Holding dormant assets in a supply and demand economy drives up demand and lowers supply.  Basic economics bud.

No thanks, already have a Masters.  I'm quite done with school.  How about you tell me how exactly the OP holding his coins makes the price decline?  Because that's what this entire fucking conversation is about.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:25:15
You're a fucking moron.  
The four basic laws of supply and demand are:
If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.
If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.
If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.
If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.

Lots of speculation and popularity.  It was making a lot of people rich, and seemed to be a better investment than gold or stocks.  It probably wouldn't have crashed so hard or at all if it weren't for Mt. Gox.  Now we've been trying to build up the trust again, and now we're creating more ways to actually use Bitcoin every day instead of just investing in it.  It will rise again.

@_date: 2015-01-28 20:20:18
Make jokes all you want.  Of course nothing can ever be 100% positive, but with proper analysis you can always profit in the end.  My analyses are correct probably around 75% of the time, which always result in profit in the end whether a single one is right or wrong.  You can't guarantee what will happen, but you can increase the chances of being correct.  
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:05:16

Apartheid is racial segregation, not segregation from non-citizens that try to kill you every day.  Also, we even take Palestinians into Israel to treat them at our hospitals and let them work in Israel.  In Apartheid south africa blacks couldn't use white bathrooms, doctors, schools, couldn't vote in their own governments, etc.  Not even close to similar.  Olmert offered them everything they wanted and even tried to give them East Jerusalem in a peace deal that would have established the Palestinian state, and they REFUSED.  Why?  They stuck to their demand to allow millions of Palestinians to become citizens of Israel INSTEAD OF citizens of the new state of Palestine.  We withdrew from Gaza as a peace effort too, kicked tons of Jews out of their homes in the process, and instead of peace they elected Hamas and attacked us every day.  What would you do?

I never even saw the lunar page until someone here posted it.  Blaming Coinbase because the price went down is silly.  Don't worry, it might still fall more, possibly to 220 during this correction, but the charts indicate a rise back above 300 soon.

I don't think our community is enough right now.  We need Bitcoin to get more popular.
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:16:12
Holding actually drives the price up.  Have you ever taken an economics course?  If you spend it, it is sold to convert into USD, and then you rebuy, and nothing has changed.  I spend my bitcoins too, and think it's great that people spend them.  But don't try telling people that holding brings the price down, absolutely false.

Neither.  I want to be able to walk into dunkin donuts and pay with bitcoin.

It was expected.  It will rise again after 220, to above 300.

You're referring to the merchants that keep PART of the funds in bitcoin.  On average, they kept 10% as bitcoin and the rest in USD.  And most still take all USD.

He said they aren't trying to keep it, they just won't convert it to Cash for him.  He could go sell it somewhere else.

Nothing wrong with Ruby.

Holding a bunch I bought at 650.  Bought more today at 575.

Most likely YOU were the one that was hacked.

Lmao.  Yea whatever you say pal, even though I live in Tokyo.  Circle still uses bitcoin/blockchain to power their transactions and cut out middle men.  Just because you can't buy and sell bitcoin doesn't mean it's not an app that supports bitcoin.  Innovative apps like this are what will drive blockchain technology, not more exchanges that average people won't use.  This is a Venmo equivalent powered by the blockchain.

I...am Batman.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:40:14
I think they made it better.  Circle as merely a place to buy and sell coins was more useless.
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:19:08
Wowwie 7 dollars.

Still a lot of work to do.  Next I'd like to add a search for friend option on the sidebar that narrows down friends list as you type the name with ajax.  Done in Ruby on Rails.

Has anyone actually been banned for it?  I've seen a lot of people complaining about it that haven't experienced it themselves.  I frequently bet on NitrogenSports and I send the money there straight from my Coinbase account, and I receive my withdrawals straight from NitrogenSports.  I've never had a problem and have never been banned.
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:38:10
I use Coinbase and gamble on Nitrogen Sports frequently, never had a problem.  
@_date: 2015-02-14 17:32:53
I'll be there.
@_date: 2015-02-14 17:31:45
I'll be there.

I wouldn't recommend giving all the info to random people o n Reddit.
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:08:50
The only reason they're able to link addresses to bets in the first place is because you guys PUBLISH ALL BETTER ADDRESSES TO THE PUBLIC ON YOUR SITE.  Jesus.
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:55:18
NitrogenSports does.  No way to tell it form any other bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:19:39
Always check where it's coming from when you get emails about anything involving Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-17 00:55:32
Or don't use a website that publishes your friggan addresses to the public for every bet.  
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:54:37
No, I use coinbase all the time for NitrogenSports transactions.  Even if it is against the TOS, how would they know whether a bitcoin address belongs to a gambling site or not?  They wouldn't.  And create a new address for every transaction.
