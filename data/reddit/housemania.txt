Cheers! It's amazing to see communities merging and people getting interested in bitcoin after yesterday's news!

there was a wonderful post today on Bitcointalk, titled "Bitcoiners, Stop Worrying About Everything!" – this one just dwells on the mood (which is exceptionally great today)

But there always are and will be newbies posting messages like this, whether or not tipping is involved.
Just like there always have been those who are very suspicious of the former.
Asking for tips is not always the case

It's not about cex or ghash; it's the article itself that is kind of good. I like their blog whether or not I use their services (which I hope they will modify somehow in the future)

That's a really great thing we are able to pay with bitcoin through Brawker. Still, the question is whether it helps the currency's wider adoption or not.
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:16:59
From your post, Brawker reminded me of social workers of some sort - the 'proper ones' who help integrating certain groups of people into the society in a simple, comfortable, and 'painless' manner.
Great read!

8 x leverage in unregulated trading sounds like recipe for losses
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:18:02
Apparently, they are asking for some extra bits (of information)
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:34:20
Even with traders, there is this strategy (known as dollar cost averaging) when you buy certain investments with a fixed regularity. It might be good to, say, buy once a month or every two weeks, regardless of the price, in order to use them where accepted while holding some.

Blame culture instead of taking responsibility for own mistakes.

One might not argue that this blog post was written by a writer :)

There are exchanges for this purpose. You can go to one of them to do the conversion. Conversion fees apply here, but it's still cheaper than sending via banks.   
Here are some exchanges:   
CEX.IO   
Coinbase.com   
Bitstamp   
Kraken   
You can find more info in the sticky post in this community.

That's insane!

How did you know? A Cotton Top Tamarin please 
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:58:16
Thanks a lot and sorry, you did it right, it's just me being outrageously lazy to finally get a changetip account! (I'll put in my NY list) It should be returned to you.

Chinese government, sad but true

If you want to make Blockchain God laugh, tell Him about your plans.
But, I really believe that if nothing really-really bad happens in the industry (no hacks, no regulation issues, etc.), then the price will steadily rise. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 10:48:21
The more people use bitcoin, the better for the price. So yeah, spread a word about bitcoin, help people buy it if they do not understand how to do it...
Yes, btw, I once paid kinda personal debt in btc. I owed some money to a friend, and he at the same time wanted to buy some bitcoins, so we did all that at very mutually beneficial exchange rate, you know.  
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:06:20
I think it's fair. It's good that all users' GHs will remain there and could be traded for BTC. That's what I did quite a while ago.
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:22:50
They say everyone will be able to resume mining by manually switching it on. Anyway, trading GHs sounds like a far better option.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:16:47
May be not this year, but it is realistic for me. However, ETF approval can drive bitcoin price already in 2017. Who knows?
Btw, if you are speaking about liquidation price...are you going to sell your BTC at $5,000? Won't you wait for a higher price? ;)
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:30:34
welcome back, man
i heard that my Canadian friends use CEX.IO to buy and sell bitcoins even though this exchange doesn't have a BTC/CAD pair yet. i use it too, but i am not from Canada. anyways, you can use your card in CAD to buy/sell btc there. and yeah, CEX has been online since 2013, just from the times you were away from bitcoin, you know. may be check it out. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:20:41
Ok, no one said it would be simple. Maybe it's worth to explain for Bitcoin beginners that if you want to buy BTC legally, you will have to provide documents. Not because exchanges want so, but because banks they work with want to, and because they are under some legislation, and their government wants to. And if any exchange doesn't accept your docs, then maybe something is wrong with them, or they just want an additional proof. 
Limits are a real crap, that's why I am fed up with Coinbase, for example. But, in most cases, once you get verified, Bitcoin purchase is smooth, really. 
I am not defending anyone, but I think I am trying to be reasonable about Bitcoin adoption. It won't happen massively if not made legal, IMHO 
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:46:54
In the CoinDesk survey, they even didn't include the option for users who obtained their BTC through multiple means. I found it impossible to complete.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:31:48
I wouldn't mess with it for sure
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:47:29
Thanks. It's just the title is somewhat misleading. I remember reading about the fines some time ago (and then again after they were reduced or something)
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:01:50
What is the main message here? That Russia is going to ban cryptocurrencies or that there are fines imposed? The latter is not something new...
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:26:43
I believe in couple years people will become more informed about it as they will become more interested. The wider the adoption - the better the understanding.
@_date: 2015-03-11 10:26:07
They worked fine for me. Depends on where you are from. Their blocked countries for credit card deposits are, as stated, US, Iceland, and Vietnam.

I'd say Bitcoin does have a potential for online dating sites, as long as they have an option of gifts, stickers, etc., which involves micro payments. Bitcoin is out of competition here, imo.  
Also, there are adult dating sites where it would solve the anonymity issue. (Although the cryptocurrency's reputation would be of concern here)
@_date: 2016-05-03 11:40:28
Withdrawal to MasterCard done. Simple and fast, like it
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:35:39
Now I have even warmer feelings towards that airline company. Looking forward to use them again. Too bad Lufthansa doesn't still accept BTC as payment
@_date: 2015-02-27 12:36:36
Looks great. But how do you use Blockchain? Isn't it blocked in Russia?
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:01:55
that's a good one) the bear shall not pass!
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:04:26
Thank you for posting this list, surely something to start from!
