I don't see it happening that way.  If I follow that logic, I see the following scenario:
 * 99% of all ASIC SHA-256 miners move to a more profitable "miner-friendly" fork shortly after a difficulty re-adjustment.
 * 1% of the hashing power sticks to the blockchain.  The difficulty is so high that transactions grind to a halt and now take 99% longer than they used to.
 * The value of non-forked bitcoin plummets because no one can make transactions on the legacy BTC network.  Meanwhile the 99% miners can move money, and are just waiting for exchanges, merchants, and users to follow suit.
 * Banks, bitcoin based enterprises, and holders of large wallets panic because their investment is falling apart.  They're forced to move to the forked blockchain if they want to use their investment.  Ultimately, they either accept the fork to resume regular business transactions, or they accept the fork to dump their failing investment.
What am I missing?  The only recourse the investors have is to either ride it out until the difficulty re-adjusts potentially *months* later, or invest in mining equipment and help the network limp along until the re-adjustment.  If they do invest in mining equipment, they suddenly have an incentive to switch over to the forked blockchain.  If the gamble doesn't pay off for the 99% miners, they can simply switch back to the legacy blockchain at little cost to themselves.  They can later pull the same shenanigans on the next difficulty increase.
The only thing I can see preventing this scenario, is the fact that Bitcoin value as a whole would have taken a huge hit during the fiasco.  If miners successfully pull off their mutiny, people will start dumping the coin for a more trustworthy investment.  The miner's own wallets would lose value because of the mass exodus.  However, if the miners dump their Bitcoin wallets before the fork, it's almost a risk free move.  If the 99% miners single-handedly destroy Bitcoin in the fork attempt, they can simply point their ASIC hardware at another SHA-256 coin and resume their money making enterprise.
