Your browser will save your password in history for auto-completion in the addressbar though, as well as the server will save all passwords in the logs. So POST is more secure than GET in that sense.

I installed Ubuntu on my file server that uses the integrated graphics in my i3-4130 3.4GHz. The system lags more and is almost as slow as my first computer I had in 2000, with a P4 CPU and 256MB RAM. Ubuntu doesn't really work well if you don't have a dedicated GPU (and why would you have a dedicated GPU in a file server).
I recently upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04. I should not have done that since it uninstalled a lot of my apps... OwnCloud was completely wiped with no warning because I got it from the OpenSUSE repo (the Ubuntu repo only has old versions). Plex Media Server was wiped because I got it as a .deb file since the version in the Ubuntu repo is almost a year old. Now I had to spend my time installing and configuring half of the reason of my file server again because the update decided to uninstall everything that did not come from the official repo. Even though they worked fine on 14.04.
The screensaver sucks. Either it doesn't come on at all, it only sends a black image to the monitor, or does it the proper way and turn the signal off completely. Whenever my Windows computer goes into screensaver mode, my screen now automatically switches input to my file server since Ubuntu keeps sending a picture to the screen.
I tried to run Linux Mint and Windows XP in a virtual machine in Ubuntu, and both Mint and XP lagged less than the host OS did...
(Why I have a GUI on my file server? It's more of a home server with an added experimentation ground in a linux environment. I'm using it from time to time to develop small things, testing scripts and stuff. It's more convenient on a small hobby-scale file server for me).

But does that apply to the buyer too? I've heard of sellers getting in trouble for it but never that someone who bought did.

I found bitcoin just weeks after it released. I mined for a while and got a decent amount, but I didn't understand what bitcoin was and thought it was illegal so I removed it. I raged much when I found bitcoin in 2011 when the price was $20 something

Radius isn't known in advance, it's chosen each day depending on number of points playing that day
Edit: Though it would be possible to prove radius separately by counting # points that round

I'm gonna check into this. Need to dust of my math skills a bit before tho, ty for the feedback :D
@_date: 2013-02-05 18:04:25
What do you mean? A random y and x coordinate is chosen using PHP's mt_rand(). The radius is based on 25+125*2^(-0.02x)px where x is number of points. I'm not good at statistics so I can't really calculate % chance of win.

Thanks, I got my payment :D. Site seems offline now tho, I hope it'll come back so someone can buy so you also get paid :o

Poor last guy who bought the expensive gem tho, nothing in return, but I guess that's the game and will happen no matter what right now. But that's really smart, if the gem reaches say 500BTC and no one buys it in months, I guess the site owner could, you know, just take it. Or to be generous, just repay the last buyer back the amount (say -5% in game runners fee) if no one buys it in x months.

Yeah, but with a really slow day it still wont work. The only payment could be early morning or something. Maybe if I fetch blockchain.info, and just take the latest transaction hash and do something with that?

What would he earn on that? Say he would buy it of himself until it reached 50BTC. Then someone falls for it and buys it off of him. If the site owner buys the gem by now, the money wont be his anymore, as it would be used to pay the other guy.
I myself bought the gem once when it was in the 1BTC range, and I know some others did a bit higher than that. He listed all addresses and transactions that happened on the site though, so if you want you could try to investigate those
