More proof. Bitcoin is only good for money laundering and other shady activities. It has no future.

No, more likely a CIA or NSA project.

lmfao OP is a funny guy. At least you noticed and believed. Better than 99pc of Reddit. Now if you could only make the connection to the actual stock market and see that OTHER "coincidence". What value did the DJIA drop a few days prior to BTC bouncing at $6666.6?

The conspiracy grows. Someone's pulling some strings to get this to happen. Why would any company add bitcoin prices for a completely irrelevant currency used by practically nobody?

They're gonna be on top of having their money eaten away by inflation through the latest currency - Bitcoin. If all the corps are pushing it, you can be sure government is behind this, and that means it's not going to benefit you.

Yes, your stepfather is definitely broke because he refused to invest in Google, not because of unrelated, poor financial decisions.

When it comes to research and development, the best of the best work for government... just because nobody can see it, that doesn't mean there isn't one. The ability to see backdoors is obviously limited by the intelligence and number of people looking at the code. But who is? I'll admit I know fuck all about the code and cannot explain the first thing about encryption. It's some very high level mathematics.

Using funny money to buy cars made by a funny company soon to be bankrupt. Sounds like a good fit actually.

Open source doesn't mean it's secure. That notion is predicated on the idea that people are actually inspecting the source code. People who are intelligent enough to actually spot vulnerabilities. But who is aside from a bunch of mouth breathing consumer vegetable tech nerds who just see "open source" and foolishly equate that with security? Thinking otherwise is just naive. You are too simple, sometimes naive.

I still can't get over the fact that "Satoshi Nakamoto" can be translated into "central" "intelligent". We're all gettin' played.

lol all these people trusting Bitcoins. Bitcoin has no future except as a way to buy black market shit.

Probably created by the CIA or a CIA affiliated party. Possibly backdoored.

Bonus pic for the downvote.

you are too young, too simple, sometimes naive...

It's funny because the whole point of Bitcoin was decentralization and anonymity, and then people throw their money into a centralized service like this and then get burned. Serves them right for being so dense.

How so? What about just buying it straight up from somebody?
The problem with these exchanges is that they always want to take a cut. The fact that they are present in every transaction makes it a centralized system, not a decentralized one. The beauty of a decentralized system is that it is truly peer to peer, the downside is the increased risk. With centralized systems, inevitable a small faction will gain absolutely control over everything, but it feels "safer". The problem seems that people have their cake and eat it too.
