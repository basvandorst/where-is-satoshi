You heavily underestimate the pressure it will have on the supply.

It literally doesn't matter at all and never did. It will slightly impact them for a few days before difficulty adjustment and and unprofitable miners are temporary shut off and that's it. They will sell most of their mining like they always did, total mined will be lower therefore available supply also will. 
There is no guarantee it will happen again exactly this way but, it always did in the past and nothing changed at all since then.

Succesful miners sell everything right away to raise capital for expansion and pay for expanse while shorting futures to make even more money on the decline. Miners don't hope for crazy price increases or else they would just buy bitcoin with their capital since it would literally be more profitable than buying a bunch of miners and paying electricity.
Well, smart miners, at least.

Blockchain is a buzzword. Xi can't control bitcoin. No one can. CCP will release a CCP crypto soon enough, it will basically be a fancy database to spy on their population. They will force public company to use it but no one else will because most Chinese know better and realise his intention. Same way the the CCP and Xi propaganda app is a requirement for public workers but basically a meme for everybody else.

If it gets to 200k, there is no reason why you would need to cash out. You would be able to spend bitcoin for whatever you need.
