You think you know a bearish downtrend? You merely adopted the lower high. I was born into it. Molded by it. I didn't see a bullish reversal until i was already a man.

Who are these people taking the time to rant and project their personal opinions onto random strangers on the internet who are not even engaged in dialog with them thinking that only thesis level posts are allowed and all others need to be virtue shamed?
Like wtf?!

The marketing acumen of there team is top notch.
Farming out exposure through minecraft competitions with enjin coins as part of the prizes is a great move.
Love their push for social media awareness and the concept is brilliant.

Thank u. I think this is intentionally being done. 
Imagine if miners were paid to lose coins by wallstreet?
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:53:06
Thank you
Any word on super bitcoin hard fork in 10 days? Good? Bad?

Hey. Any community news on the super bitcoin fork in 10 days? Seems kinda important
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:44:12
Thank you.
And yet, it's still being done intentionally
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:59:46
I think we are going to repeat the same breakout on the chart from 11/14
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:15:40

If u were the top coin holder it would benefit you by decreasing the supply and driving up the price.
What if your mining energy came from a stolen source like whats occuring in russia?
Or renewable energy
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:00:21
Almost as if it was done intentionally...
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:58:34
What if some one is paying miners to intentionally destroy the supply of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:48:49
They don't think it be like it is, but it do...
