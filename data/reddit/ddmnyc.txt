Yesterday a friend who I had told about bitcoin no fewer than 10 times in the past two years called me to let me know about this new thing they had just heard about and wanted to know if I knew what it was. 
What was it?
~ sigh ~
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:35:00
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:51:45
This. We all probably found it exciting to think that the world would somehow overnight start accepting bitcoin as a replacement for cash and credit cards, and were disappointed to see very few merchants getting on board even as the price kept rising. But merchants who need to keep their lights on and customers happy don't want to deal with wildly fluctuating currencies and eight decimal points, and fanatical users who are willing to wait up to an hour for their transaction to be confirmed before they can enjoy that first sip of coffee (yep, people did this). Bitcoin as a currency is nowhere close to being a reality, but that doesn't deny its utility as an emergency exit from an economic system built on the debt slavery of hundreds of millions of people.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:33:32
Price isn't correlated to an illustration.

He means this kind of wallet:
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:52:22
Just some friendly advice: Never tell people how much BTC you have. You might as well post your home address while you're at it. 
Serious questions: How much research into bitcoin's history did you do before you took out a loan against your house? Was this a decision you made with your family/spouse, or on your own? Can you stand to wait it out until the price recovers? What if it takes a year or more (as has happened), and in the meantime, the price goes down another 30-50%? 
There's always a chance you can recover from this and it will turn out fine in the long run. However, there are so many unpredictable things in this new space that nothing is guaranteed. Bitcoin is an experiment. It could still fail. You have to accept that possibility and do what your gut says is right for you and your family.
Good luck.

When you use a wallet that you control – not a website, but a mobile app or program on your computer, etc. – you hold the private keys. This way, there is no company that can disappear overnight and take your money with it. Bitcoin is about ownership. If you don't own the keys, you don't own the bitcoin. Do your homework.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:01:37

Venmo advertises all over NYC. (Granted, it's mostly being drowned out by PayPal's new campaign.) Also, it was built to treat money like a social network. It's very tame and devoid of politics and ideology, which I know tends to scare new people away from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 08:30:31
You can't do that, unfortunately. It only works with addresses where you control the private keys. I almost had a heart attack once when I saw one of my addresses get emptied out, until I realized it was one that was being held by an exchange.

I don't recommend you buy at any specific price. If you're interested in acquiring bitcoins at a steady pace, buy a small amount on a regular schedule. This means you won't be risking a large amount all at once, and finding yourself wishing you'd just waited an hour, a day, or a week. 
Also, repeat after me:
DO NOT PANIC BUY.
DO NOT PANIC SELL.

I became a cord-cutter this year, returning my TimeWarner cable box and downgrading my service to Internet-only, saving myself close to $100/mo. I have kids who watch a lot of shows on Netflix and Amazon Prime, so they don't really feel like they're missing much, and I've been getting by without network TV for a while. 
Most of what I watch is available on one a few streaming services, but my wife really wanted some shows that only air on the major networks, so I set us up with an Aereo account earlier this year. For the most part, it worked pretty well, until it didn't. It completely crashed during the Oscars, which was a big let down for me, and I nearly relented and upgraded us back to basic cable when Aereo was shut down by the Supreme Court, but a couple of weeks ago I found out about Tablo TV, a box that can receive and DVR over-the-air HD signals through an antenna, and plays to a TV through a Roku, as well as on an iPad or Android tablet.
I decided to make this my first purchase on Purse.io. I made a wishlist containing a Tablo device, a 1 TB USB hard drive, and a flat HD antenna, for a grand total of $313. I posted it with a 25% discount, and within one day, the order had been placed and I had it delivered 2-day prime. Total amount spent: $243. 
Tablo is magic. Purse.io is magic. Bitcoin is magic.
We live in amazing times.

Moving USD into Coinbase is just like moving USD between any two banks. You are at the mercy of the ACH system. Once you have your bitcoin, you'll see how quickly you can spend it. Try buying yourself a gift card on Gyft or eGifter so you can try it out, or pick a merchant that accepts bitcoin like Overstock and order something.  
You should also get level 2 verified (requires adding a Visa card) so you can instantly access up to $1000 of BTC a week.

For starters, Coinbase wasn't started by a chubby French manchild with a thing for cats and Frappuccinos. 
But seriously, it's a venture-backed company with deep roots in the Silicon Valley ecosystem. It's also not an exchange, and does not have insider trading bots pumping fake volume. 
But – as has been said on here many times – you should never keep more than the coins you are planning to spend in a web wallet where you don't control the private keys.

Despite the merchant fees, I've been very happy with PayPal's ease of use. A lot of excellent features have been added, such as in-person mobile payments at restaurants could easily be adapted for bitcoin. I currently use a PayPal debit card which links to my bank account, but is more secure than using my own bank's card, because the PayPal card is one step removed from my bank. I can add daily transaction limits and I receive an instant email receipt from every transaction. We should look at Ebay/PayPal's interest in bitcoin as a great way to spread mass adoption.

There are no fees according to the FAQ: 
However, you did bring up an important point:
I noticed that the pending amount hasn't updated on Coinbase, and looks like it won't for up to 24 hours. So, what is preventing someone from moving their balance out of their connected wallet, and invalidating the transaction before it clears? 
That seems risky to me, and it's one weak link in the chain that I'd like to get an answer on.

I would argue that a paper wallet is a great way to introduce new people to bitcoin, because it's something they can hold in their hands that has value. You can compare it to writing a check, except that instead of a check being a promise to pay funds from one account to another, a paper wallet is a verifiable way to know that the money is there before you try to deposit it.

They don't offer a PayPal option either. I had been using PayPal's debit card.

The fact that bitcoin doesn't hold a fixed dollar value will be confusing for store owners. When you buy a $50 Amazon card, you know it's always going to cost $50. What does a 0.10 BTC card cost?

Credit card transactions require a settlement process, but you could probably link your bank account to Coinbase or Circle to move the money into BTC when it hits the account. 
I've been trying out Shift Card this week, which is an easy way to spend BTC using a credit/debit card, but it's still in beta, and that's not exactly the solution to your problem.

Not necessarily. It's hard to point to one reason, but the general consensus from many redditors is there is too much sell pressure from miners who need to cash out to pay their power bills, some market manipulation by big investors who want to buy low before the next rally to a new all-time high, and merchants who convert back to fiat currency immediately. And then there's the NYS BitLicense which should be finalized by the beginning of November, which many people are waiting for to make long term investment decisions. All of these issues are probably suppressing the price, but should not last indefinitely. This seems (to me) like as good a buying opportunity as ever. As always, YMMV.

Here's my take on bitcoin debit cards. They're great, except that the process for payments to clear still runs on the old rails, so expect the exchange rate to be quite different by the time the transaction actually completes. Sometimes you get lucky, and your purchasing power goes up by then, but it could very easily go down as well, meaning you will be spending more BTC on something than you might have otherwise intended.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:09:34

The owner of the account has control over how much is in the wallet.

You. Are. ADORABLE.
OK, let me break this down a bit.
You have a wallet. Awesome! You can have as many wallets as you want. Each wallet can contain many addresses. 
So an address like this:
is called a public key. This is safe to email to people, or post online, and allows you to receive bitcoins directly from other people.
NEVER give out your password or private key to ANYONE. EVER.
Software wallets like Electrum and MultiBit put you in control of your private keys. This is recommended when you are storing your coins, because you are not handing over control to a third party.
Some wallets, like Coinbase and Circle are hosted, meaning that your private keys are stored with a company that you (can hopefully) trust. These are great services to buy bitcoin. A lot of people on reddit will tell you not to keep much money there, but they are insured against theft, so you need to decide what level of comfort you have with these services compared to your own ability to secure your coins yourself. It's completely your decision.
Then there are services like ChangeTip, which is basically a hosted wallet with some unique features, such as the ability to send small amounts of bitcoin to people, many of whom do not yet have an account with them. They will hold the unclaimed tip amount for a week before the tip expires, at which point it will be returned to your wallet. If your recipient logs in and accepts it, or already has a ChangeTip account, the bits are deposited into their wallet immediately. 
You can always withdraw your coins to your external wallet at any time just by pasting your wallet's public key into the ChangeTip's Withdraw box and entering in the amount you want to receive. 
It's important to remember that most bitcoin transactions take place on a global network, so there are small fees (a few cents) paid to the miners for verifying your transactions, so you need to make sure you have enough in your wallet to cover that if you want to withdraw funds outside of ChangeTip. *(ChangeTip hosts all of its customers' wallets, so there are no fees to send and receive tips.)*
Hope I didn't nerd out too much. There's a lot to know. But try logging in and accepting that tip, and you'll hopefully see how easy it is.

Even if, in the far future, so many people have lost their wallets that only a single Bitcoin, or a fraction of one, remains, Bitcoin should continue to function just fine. No one can claim to be sure what is going to happen, but deflation may prove to present a smaller threat than many expect."*

Transactions are much much faster than credit cards. You are thinking of confirmations, which take around 10 minutes, not the actual transaction broadcast which is near-instantaneous. With a credit card, settlement can take several days, and the transaction can be reversed up to 60 days later, putting the seller at risk of a huge loss. That can't happen with bitcoin. Also, when you spend bitcoin, you are authorizing the exact amount of money to be sent and no more. Credit cards can be charged multiple times, and it's up to you to dispute the charges. This is how a lot of shady businesses have bilked customers out of huge sums of money over the years, by trapping them into monthly billing contracts.

I'm not disputing that. We may very well see sub-$275 soon. I'm only saying that a lot of predictions have been made about the price this year. You can look at graphs lots of ways. Just looking at one year is somewhat arbitrary. Calling $325 "cheap" is really very subjective.

I'd recommend caution when championing conservatives (or liberals) too much over their nascent embrace of bitcoin. Check their individual voting and donation records and see how many of them have been benefiting from and passing legislation on behalf of the so-called "too-big-to-fail" banks and brokerages that caused the last economic crisis and will happily cause another one. Bitcoin is too important to be attributed to a specific political movement. This is why I generally don't buy the "we discovered it first" argument.

Put 2-factor authentication on eveything you can. If you use Gmail, install Google Authenticator to generate a unique code every time you login from a new computer. If you use Coinbase, Blockchain.info, etc., do the same. You should use a password manager such as LastPass and generate unique passwords for every site you visit that contains financial or personal information. 
That's just a start. This is reddit, so I'm sure someone here will call me an idiot, or give you better advice.

So is the point that Bitreserve expects the value to rise over time, and they will guarantee your bitcoin from losses with their anticipated gains?

One good strategy is to spend your coins and support the bitcoin merchant economy. Do you buy things with fiat that can be bought with bitcoin? Stick to a budget and re-buy the same amount of BTC later at a lower price. Instant discount. If you buy on Amazon a lot, use purse.io, or check out Overstock and NewEgg. We are the bitcoin economy, and we shouldn't be immobilized by a bearish market.

There's another word for a "centralized organization," and that's a "business." We want more businesses involved in bitcoin, don't we? Isn't that how it spreads to the masses the fastest? Not everyone wants to download the core client or store keys on their home computers.

Beyond reminding you that this is not the Coinbase support forum, I don't see what they did wrong. They have a responsibility to prevent fraudulent use of their users' accounts. You will probably need to have this issue sorted out between your credit card issuer and Coinbase to have the hold removed. In the meantime, you can still purchase bitcoin using other methods like Local Bitcoins. It's also worth noting that you shouldn't store all of your coins in Coinbase or any web wallet if you want to keep them safe from thieves.

I find their motivations are often suspect. An example of this is in the vehement opposition to the health care reforms that were originally proposed by conservatives, enacted by a moderate Republican governor, but when applied nationally by a moderate (Obama is far from a socialist) Democrat, the original conservative ideals behind it no longer applied.

Yeah, once I closed an account with an awful regional bank that was later acquired by Bank of America. Unbeknownst to me, they charged me an overdraft fee on my last check because it was deposited after I attempted to close the account. I had changed my address and never got the notice, so I didn't even know there was a problem until I tried to open a new account at Citibank. I was told I would have to go back to Bank of America to work out what I supposedly owed them in order to have my name removed from Chex System so I could open my new account. When I went into the branch, the manager basically looked at me like I was dog shit. I had to pay cash on the spot, and still had to wait something like 48 or 72 hours until I could open my new account, and only after explaining that it was due to a mail forwarding problem. I have despised Bank of America and Citibank ever since.

This is not correct. Circle just emphasizes the dollar amount. It's important to note that when you buy bitcoin on Circle you can specify BTC as opposed to USD. I think some people are alarmed because they try to buy $100 of BTC and think they're getting a certain amount, and actually receive a different amount due to the exchange rate fluctuation. Circle should do a better job communicating this to its customers.

This means Coinbase will still be generating paper wallets that can't be imported into Blockchain.info, and any other wallet that doesn't read compressed keys. I understand this is not Coinbase's problem to solve, but in an industry that really needs some standards to help new people understand what's going on, this is an example of poor communication. Why not just inform people that the key is compressed, and offer an option to uncompress it? If I give a paper wallet to a friend who doesn't use Coinbase, and he can't load it into his wallet without digging through Google searches and calling me up in a panic, this feature is useless.

One other thing to maybe consider. Many 401k plans allow you to take a loan against the value of your investment. This means you can withdraw a portion of the money, as long as you agree to pay it back on a regular schedule with interest, but the interest goes back into your own account. In essence, you're giving yourself a loan. I did this a few years back to pay for some educational expenses.

Something similar happened to me when an ACH transaction between two bank accounts didn't clear in time and they couldn't debit the money. They removed my bitcoin without making a second ACH attempt even though their support rep told me they wouldn't do that. I think I'm done with them for a while.

@_date: 2014-11-05 02:52:36
LevelUp is a loyalty rewards program wrapped in a proprietary centralized payment system tied to your debit or credit card. They scan your QR code to make a withdrawal from your account. This is still the opposite of using a bitcoin app. People like it because they don't have to learn any new rules and it keeps their pockets free of punch/stamp card clutter. It's still a long road from here to bitcoin, despite the similarities.
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:40:54
I'm definitely going to look into that. Early on I just made a bunch of paper wallets and put about 2/3 of my bitcoins on them and stowed them in a safe place. I'm thinking of buying the Mycelium Entropy dongle now.

Bitcoin at the cash register is still a scary concept for a lot of retail businesses because of the concerns about zero confirmation transactions. I think this is one of bitcoin's biggest adoption problems, and may remain one for years to come. 
Solutions like Gyft are a great first step. I've paid using Gyft cards on my phone and ended up having conversations with the cashiers about bitcoin (no secret: they often love talking to customers because it lets them slow down a little). 
An even better solution than Gyft would be if the folks behind coinforcoffee.com and foldapp.com launch with a Whole Foods instant gift card option.
*Edit:* Still, I wrote a message to them. Every bit helps.

RemindMe! One month Is bitcoin worth more than it was one year ago?
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:42:10
You send the payment to the recipient, and the remaining balance is returned to you. Imagine you're buying an item for $10 but all you have is a $100 bill. The cashier will hand you back $90. It's jarring the first few times you see it, but that's just how it operates. 
BTW - If you send your bitcoin from a hosted wallet like Coinbase, it's done differently and you never end up exposing your wallet's full balance.
Also, I don't know much about Steam, but some merchants will hold your order until after your transaction receives 6 or more confirmations. Best to check with them to find out what their policy is. (It's also a holiday weekend, so any transactions that are manually processed might be delayed.)

I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival in April and even then it was feeling a bit dated, ending not long after the Gox crash. But it was worth watching to see the backstory on the heady days of BitInstant and Tradehill. It made me kind of want to kick myself for not getting started in bitcoin sooner, but then I realized that most of the people in the theater had probably never used bitcoin before, and I realized that I was still way ahead of the curve on this.

Seeing as how, historically, one would need to own a significant amount of bitcoins for a year or more to see returns, I would not call it a scheme to get rich. Most people I know who are speculating are not day trading, and they are buying and holding it not out of greed but out of enthusiasm for a revolutionary but risky pre-mainstream technology that has shown remarkable upside potential.

Delusional means having false or unrealistic beliefs. I watched the video, and his conclusion is still based on a very shaky foundation at best. Bitcoin is not "encrypted money." It's a cryptographic ledger of exchange. It is taxable, and if you don't believe so, try hiding your bitcoin gains from the IRS for a few years and see where that gets you. And he makes the claim that the volatility is not an issue. Try telling that to people who went all in last December and lost their life savings. The man is delusional.

You need both, especially when running one of the foremost consumer services. They have $30 million invested in their platform. User interface is critical to adoption. Or do you prefer things just stagnate and we don't build a larger user base because people perceive services like these to be error-prone. It's the same thing as any other service where you entrust your money. You probably wouldn't use a traditional  bank that had spelling mistakes on its website and brochures. It makes one wonder what else they're neglecting.

Now that the Bitstamp price has literally flatlined at just under $277, I have to ask… who expects the price to recover quickly in light of this recent debacle? Recall when MtGox shut down, the price of bitcoin was trading in the mid $600 range on other exchanges, and we saw a swift decline down to the $400s, likely due to panic selling and overall lack of confidence in other exchanges. With the price so much lower now, I don't imagine it would take much more panic selling to drive us down to the $100 range, if not lower. I'm not trying to spread FUD here, I just think we need a reality check. Depending on how Bitstamp resolves this issue, the price may not recover from this for a long time, and we could be in for more rough times ahead.

Doubtful, if it's considered a lawful currency issued by a nation that the US recognizes. 
But if you read the text, it says that this *clarification*
"Specifies that current law which bans the issuance or circulation of anything but lawful money of the United States does not prohibit the issuance and use of alternative currency."
The original law was designed to prohibit counterfeit US currency, which bitcoin is not. I understand that you probably take a disdainful position towards any government regulations, but some are actually designed to prevent people from being victimized by criminals.

You just need to memorize an elevator pitch. There are lots of places where you can learn now.
*Bitcoin is a digital currency that people all over the world use to buy and sell things without the need for a bank. It's secure because of a giant network of computers that work 24/7/365 to process transactions and keep all account balances accurate. It's free to send or receive almost any amount of money, and it protects its users from credit card fraud, identity theft, and chargebacks.*
Something like that is usually my starting point. If they want to get more granular I usually point them to some online tutorials like World Bitcoin Network.

I have worked with the homeless for the past year. Bitcoin in its present form poses significant challenges for homeless people. Many have very intermittent access to the internet (if at all) and the learning curve to understand bitcoin, (let alone how to use multisig) is very steep. 
I helped a young man with an Android phone, who was using free public wi-fi hotspots to get online download Mycelium, and sent him his first dollar in bitcoin. Other people helped him out with tips over the internet. He eventually had over $20 in his wallet, but when I talked to him a few months later, he had lost both the phone and his master passphrase (his bag with his notebook had been stolen), and he was out the money. 
I found a possible application for helping homeless people directly was to connect them with services like ChangeTip where they didn't have to secure their own private keys, and they could load up FoldApp to use at Starbucks or buy Gyft cards. But the low amounts of bitcoin donated by the public, and the limited places that accept it, make this almost not worth the effort. 
That's why, over the past several months, I've been working more with established institutions like shelters, and helping raise money that way. With the ChangeTip Social Giving campaign, we put nearly $5000 in the hands of a Philadelphia homeless shelter, which will provide thousands of meals to the homeless.
I still believe there is a huge potential for showing the unbanked poor in this country how to handle their own money, and this will start with education. I'm currently looking for a way to set up bitcoin 101 workshops through homeless outreach programs to provide this sort of knowledge, but assuming that people living on the street will pick up this type of knowledge on their own is rather unrealistic.

I am sure it is difficult being a public figure in such a chaotic space. I wouldn't invite this upon myself, and that's why I don't blog or podcast about bitcoin. But canceling your Twitter account and essentially turning your back on the bitcoin community with that post is a pretty extreme move, and will likely erode morale even further. If you don't care about that, then by all means, carry on. Last week, when Andreas was giving out the number to the suicide hotline on the LTB podcast, I said to myself, "Really? Has it actually come to this?" Even in the darkest days of the Mt Gox collapse, people were engaged and optimistic. Now that we have Bill Gates and PayPal in our corner, we're capitulating? Only a month ago you tweeted how awesome it was that you could buy a whole bitcoin for under $500 and that people in a generation wouldn't believe it was ever that cheap. And you know what? People followed your advice and bought. And now that we're approaching 50% of that market price, you're folding. I'm sure a bunch of people also bought Nautilus, and Vertcoin when you were promoting them, because you came across as an honest and trustworthy person. That's why it's even more disappointing to read a post like yours today.

There are no more than 16,707,000 BTC in circulation, and a portion of them are unrecoverable, effectively owned by nobody.
There are currently around 325,000,000 people living in the United States.
If distributed evenly, that would leave each American with about 0.05 BTC, currently just a little over 500 bucks.
If you think $10,000 per BTC seems high, think about how few people in the world will ever be able to own a single bitcoin, or even $500 worth.
Insanely bullish.

Let's see, what's more convenient to make an online payment...
1. Entering in my credit card number, name, type of card, expiration date, security number.
2. Rummaging through my desk to find a checkbook, writing a check with a ball-point pen, putting it in an envelope, sealing it with my spit, writing an address on the envelope, finding a stamp, putting it in a mailbox, waiting for the other party to receive the check, waiting for the other party to deposit the check, waiting for the funds to clear.
3. Entering a bitcoin address and pressing send.

Most venture-backed companies are not in a hurry to turn profits, as short-term gains are usually a bad idea at this early stage. Retail companies naturally will be slumping, as the majority of people spending bitcoin now acquired them prior to 2014 when the price was significantly lower. Even if 95% of bitcoin companies fail, that is still not a sign that bitcoin itself won't succeed. We only have to look at the dot-com bubble to understand this.

I was wary of posting the address publicly, but after doing some investigating, I'm willing to go ahead. This is the address:
It seems to be an address with some strange circumstances around it:
To answer some questions and shed a bit more light on the subject:
I created my Blockchain.info account in 2014. I never owned any bitcoin in April of 2013. I am fairly certain I generated this address on the browser version of Blockchain.info. I suppose it's possible that I might have imported it somehow, but I don't have any information about that. I don't think I ever made any transactions with it. It's just been sitting in my account along with a bunch of other addresses generated in same way.
The first time I noticed any activity on this address was on 22 May 2015 when I received these notifications, back-to-back:
Payment Received Notification
A Payment has been received into your bitcoin wallet. 
338b8fb0fe5166409343892579c6e36d5aa2e3e9af13d3680b9c5e3839ee95bd 
1GDpYBZ7B2yp7zKJjssp9Ti5YxzfaaYqyp 
15FeNPVZboYWyNv8U5J9VL5VLqkhHDJCYC 
0.01 BTC
Payment Sent Notification
A Payment has been sent from your bitcoin wallet. 
574c08521d5fbac24ebf0b7d4f9d27e7f0ef79e9345cb10ef3df83c7ea4df401 
15FeNPVZboYWyNv8U5J9VL5VLqkhHDJCYC 
1aaNe55TGFJUiYYrC6ihGHJauddhUTaYY 
0.0099 BTC
Because these were such small amounts, I pretty much ignored them, assuming they were related to one of my Counterparty watch-only addresses, but then on 25 Sep 2015, it happened again, only with larger amounts:
Payment Received Notification
A Payment has been received into your bitcoin wallet.
15FeNPVZboYWyNv8U5J9VL5VLqkhHDJCYC 
0.07019538 BTC
Payment Sent Notification
A Payment has been sent from your bitcoin wallet.
1aa5cmqmvQq8YQTEqcTmW7dfBNuFwgdCD 
0.07007538 BTC
So if you check the timestamps, you can see the incoming and outgoing transactions happened pretty much at the exact same moment.
I've had Blockchain.info support looking into it, but so far, the case is unresolved. Thanks for everyone's comments and suggestions. I am definitely making plans to get out of there ASAP. It's Friday again. :)

@_date: 2015-10-04 13:34:38
Dumb comment. He (it's a dude) knows what bitcoin is, but it was ChangeTip users doing the tipping. You're welcome to offer him any amount of bitcoin. Just go ask him to send you his wallet address and let me know how that works out. ChangeTip solves the problem of off-chain micropayments on social media nicely. Have you built a better product?
@_date: 2015-10-30 23:52:53
People are paying a much higher amount to buy bitcoin in person or using other services. In the long run these fees are annoying but not astronomical. Let's ask someone who works at ChangeTip why it costs this much. But if someone needs to acquire some bitcoin and doesn't want to wait a week, $1.50 doesn't seem like such an inconvenience. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 01:27:20

There is as much a case to be made for people with left-of-center political views, or even non-political views to get behind bitcoin as a technology. Unless you are a rich banker, the banking system does not work for you. Credit card fraud makes everything more expensive, and high fees hurt people with the least money and connections. I wish that libertarians would stop pretending that they alone own a claim to bitcoin and start doing what it takes to push for widespread usage. I doubt most African villagers give a shit about the philosophical differences between Austrian or Keyensean economics. They just want something that will help them feed their families.

I always discount my BTC price by around 10-15% but it still doesn't seem to make a whole lot of impact. Once in a while someone will agree to try it, but the second time they usually forget how, and ask to go back to their old "tried and true" way.

Your supposition is completely untrue. I've never lost any amount due to lack of securing my private keys. This is because I inherently treat them as far more valuable pieces of information than passwords in a centralized system. 
I *know* I can get a bank to reset my info by using my personal details. What is annoying is that I have to (a) share it at all with a bank I don't do regular business with, and (b) call a customer service number in order to regain access to my account when I have the required information to have the password reset automatically. 
If you've lost bitcoins due to your own lax security practices, I feel for you, but that is not even remotely what I am talking about.

Worse, because at least with a check I can just take a photo of it with my banking app and it gets deposited right away. This QuickPay crap is worthless. If PayPal didn't take such an enormous cut of everything, I'd prefer clients pay that way, but it's just not worth it.

Again, *the writer is a dude* (the profile pic is Jamie Lee Curtis from the movie Halloween), and if it was ChangeTip users doing the tipping, what do you care who he is thanking? Maybe it's simple to you because you already know everything there is to know about bitcoin. So go build a better tipping service, rather than telling people who they should be thanking.

Man, you are misinformed. I have been handing out coffee to the homeless of NYC for over two months, and many people in fact do have smartphones. You have to realize that most homeless people do not wish to be homeless, and often ended up in this situation due to tragic personal circumstances. They may have only a few possessions accessible to them at any given time, but many people have prepaid Android phones, which are a lifeline to them. They use them to access free wi-fi networks in the NYC subway, and from places like Starbucks. I have been showing a small group of homeless people how to receive bitcoin on their phones, and use services like FoldApp to spend bitcoin at Starbucks (at 20% off, in fact). And for those who don't have phones, I simply buy coffee (and often food) for them using bitcoin on my phone. I'm not trying to change the world, just make a few people happy each day.

The first transactions appeared nearly a year prior to my opening a Blockchain.info account.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:54:35
I found several problems with this service:
* The 20% service fee and 2000 bit miner fee is excessive.
* They do not use SSL, so there are security issues.
* The email reply from the Yahoo account I used to test this went into the Spam folder, so most people would never see it.
* When I did find the message, I saw that it only had a 10 minute payment window. This is problematic considering that someone might need to acquire bitcoin in order to send a message, and that process may take longer than 10 minutes.
* There was no hyperlink to open a bitcoin app, just a raw address, not even one that would be easily copy/paste-able from a mobile phone.
* Lastly, the PayPal button was an image that was blocked by my email client by default, and there was no text-backup version.
Overall, nice idea, but could use better implementation.

Point taken, but I see the discount as a temporary loss in order to encourage more usage among people who aren't experienced with bitcoin yet. And of course, it does depend on the value of BTC outpacing savings rates over time. At some point, I expect I won't have a need to offer discounts.
