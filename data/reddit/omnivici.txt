Ugh. seems like a marketing play. Since the CEO of the company approves of Bitcoin/block chain technology, takes payments in it, owns the exchange they are selling crypto shares on, and the first buyer is the CEO... Much like the example he said it was not. Well it's a natural value abstraction for the blockchain to take on, and the first of many I'm sure. Since mining is still profitable these adoptions of the blockchain don't matter much, however once the network is surviving on fees alone... It becomes beneficial to humanity once decentralized governance or justice is implemented as well, far off though.

It does have benefits but perhaps not for these established global companies, they are likely tight knit with the banking sector already, and as it was already said, the life of higher up people is likely made easier for keeping it that way.
The benefit of low friction global payments is more directly beneficial for online content sales to consumers or start ups i imagine, but we're likely a ways off from being able to sustain and grow an ecosystem within Bitcoin. 
The beginnings of it are there such as coinbase, circle, bitpay, but a closed loop system where supply and consumer demand are all processed internally, without bleeding out to fiat for suppliers.

And if they follow through with it, imagine the interest from other companies who will see the marketing opportunity to put their own companies on the spotlight, in the Btc train.
The benefits of bitcoin are as real and available as they were since it's inception and will only improve once it's integrated more and more into the real world. 
The longer bitcoin exists without becoming a major player in remittance, the safer companies dismissing it will feel. If they see bitcoin plastered on everyone's TV right before or after their own advertisements, over and over again, they might realize it's time to get with it. Self fulfilling cycle begins.

I think you are overlooking a few simple yet tremendously scalable and self reinforcing factors. All you said is correct, however with a flood of weak mining chips out in the wild, in the hands of people who would not stop 30 seconds to understand what a wallet is, much less how to make one, deal with their tremendous anxiety or fear of losing it, getting over their fear of it being a scam, etc.
This makes it look like savings, even if it quickly becomes trivial. Or does it? If the flood of devices is sustained, big farming operations continue raking in the real bounty, but with a miner on every phone, router, TV set, etc, it's a lot common to make a small amount, and so it doesn't look like a trivial amount when comparing yourself to everyone else's mining bounty.
And how does this reinforce itself? Well just the sheer fact that there would be a specification on mass distributed electronics that require no knowledge of what the specification entails, is bound to raise awareness of bitcoin, and thus raising adoption (price) etc.
If this startup works out, it has a more realistic chance of being a killer app than expecting every Joe Sixpack to understand wallet cold/hot storage, multi key encryption, dedicated devices for wallets, and the list goes on. This is plug on the wall, it works. People will pay for that.

No one is disputing his honesty, integrity or habit of speaking his mind. Matter of fact, it shows through even on this news piece.
The fact he has 63 billion is irrelevant to the point, if he is a good investor as you seem to idolize him, YES he should care if his investments make or lose 'a dollar'.
Desperation would be me writing a news article telling people to stay away from my competitors. A silly premise for silly people to read. Anyone with a brain can see what vested interest I'd have in the premise, instead of glazing their view based on what presumption of honesty, integrity or habit of speaking my mind would garnish.

I think what he means is once all the public shares are issued, and in the scenario that they all get bought up, and still there is demand for these shares from outside the market that is selling these current shares, the owners could sell them at inflated prices to cut a profit over what they originally bought the share for.
And then they can buy Bitcoin with it and ride the train twice, once in the stock, and then in Bitcoin price because if the shares are being bought even at a premium, Bitcoin prices are rising with it.
I might be completely wrong though.

Someone out there who saw this thread took a moment to read it, understood the intent, and instead of feeling 'forced' to change, felt reinforced in their conviction that a softer tone will sell to more users.

1) correct. And there is no need for it to be separate, ever. It's only a problem when all the content seems geared at driving a profit, forgetting that adoption is what will work towards its success. Not milking currently aware users dry.
2) they definitely are. They can also protect and nourish their investment by spreading the word. I feel a vibe of complacency nowadays in the Bitcoin community. We used to be a handful of nerds fighting to put Bitcoin on the map, now that it has a tiny spot everyone seems ok with leaving it as is. There is no talk of spreading the word.

The reason you don't have to vote for new features on your phone is because there is an economic incentive to improve phones over the competition. There would be no reason to assure the bootstrapping entrepreneur that he will have a chance of growing, in a market freely shaped by whatever monopoly currently runs it. That's why you can't come up with a phone in your spare time and have a chance of getting rich from it, it takes huge amounts of resources and research for that new feature, which requires coordination that the layman consumer does not have.

And I agree, but those needs can be met in fiat, which will cost you much less in the long run. Unless you ONLY deal in BTC, your argument is invalid.
If you have 1000 rabbits (fiat) and 100 cows (BTC) and the guy selling you the pair of shoes wants one animal in exchange for the shoes, would you pay a rabbit or a cow?
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:59:59
Ok first off, you need to understand a few things instead of making wild assumptions:
* If an investment firm pumps it up to $300, that would cost them a tremendous amount of money, and they would be relying on other people spending more money than them in order for them to get a return. You cannot pump the market to 300, and cash it all out at 300. that is not the way it works. As soon as they start dumping, the market starts dumping as well, and soon they are stuck holding assets that they themselves paid well over the landing price. There is no such thing as "taking fool's money". If they hold a large percentage of the market, they are the ones most at risk of a market crash.
* Decentralized exchanges are in the works, and it's a matter of time before they come about. It's already established that Bitcoins are not illegal, and considering the massive amount of resources it would take to track down bitcoin payments to specific merchants, it's unenforceable even if they decided to make such an uneducated power-grab.
* Bitcoin is going mainstream. If they were considering banning it, you wouldn't be seeing positive or neutral talk about it on CNBC, Fox, Bloomberg, and many many others.
* If SR gets busted, another one comes up. Where there is a demand, there is a supply.
With all of these things being said, let me remind you that it has only been a few months since bitcoin officially left obscurity. The infrastructure you see for it is in bare bones stage. There are legions of developers and businesses scrambling to provide goods and services in exchange for bitcoin. It's a billion dollars looking for things to buy.

Create a game where the currency is backed by Bitcoin (much like second life's Lynden is back by USD). The only ways to get in-game currency would be to deposit BTC or make very, very small amounts of money by performing in-game tasks (The source for this could come from the fees collected). He could than provide all sorts of in-game services that charge currency, fees for converting back and forth, clothes/weapons/etc.

Also since I didn't see you discuss how you intend to receive payment for the service, I think you should offer the service to paying customers in fiat as well, and just convert it to BTC via an exchange to compensate miners.

Because the fact that BTC is capped by that amount regardless of how much is in circulation at any given moment, that is the number you should evaluate the overall market by, however one could argue that it's not too prudent, as there is a possibility that everyone mining BTC would convert it to fiat as soon as they get the BTC, which would inadvertently drive the market down $200 million instead of up.
TL;DR It can be argued both ways.

Hah! You see, that's the root of it all. 
First they offer the service of safeguarding the bitcoin for you. 
Then they offer you bitcoin certificates, because you know, everyone wants to keep them safe anyways so why even remove form the vault? Just trade the certificate and you now own the bitcoins in the safe. 
Then they start making loans from the profits they make for safeguarding your coins. 
Then they make loans against your bitcoins in the vault. 
Then they introduce fractional reserve systems. 
Then they disconnect the certificates from the bitcoins (ie. USD and gold).
Then they give the right to print certificates to one of the banks, and we are back to Quantitative Easing.

There is not one correct statement in your comment.
* We are not in a gold standard, and have not been for many, many years.
* Good luck finding the gold in the fed. They will take 7 years to give Germany's gold back, guess why.
* Fiat is backed by legal decree, not by itself.
* Inflation does not destroy fiat, fiat is destroyed by the fact that it can be created out of nothing, adding no value, which is not a necessity in order for there to be inflation. Inflation can occur even on a gold standard.
* generally non deflationary? So you mean inflationary correct?

You are very misinformed about how law makers behave around things that could make them a lot of money. You are also misinformed as to how bitcoin works and what dangers a 51% attack poses, which might I add, grows continually more difficult to pull off by the minute, the bitcoin network is already stronger than the top super computer, and were not even at 0.5% adoption. Drastic measures like that are unlikely until we at least pose an immediate threat to the fiat economy.

I personally made a bit of money when the previous bubble was blowing up. My listings on eBay were for a "physical index card, which just happened to have mtgox bitcoin redeemable code. I priced the auctions taking into account my estimation of what they would be priced at within the next 24 hours, only with the buyout function so if someone did not buy it I could delete and reprice according to big movements.
I also took into consideration all fees for repurchasing the bitcoins, including an hourly rate equivalent to what I get paid for at my unrelated day job. And on top of that, any eBay and PayPal fees, and finally, $25 on top of it as my "profit".
 I kept most of my transaction under $100 to avoid issues with chargebacks, so it would not hold down my entire operation if I got chargeback on a huge purchase.
As soon as I made the sale, I printed the coupon code on the card, threw it in an envelope, dropped it off, transferred funds to my bank account from PayPal, and repurchased the same amount I sold from coin base. I only used gox to run the redeemable coupon codes, that way I didn't even have to deal with private keys. 
Operation ran smooth, didnt get a single chargeback, and even if I did I would win it with the physical index card proof, which was mentioned several times throughout the auction. 
Made a couple hundred bucks from this, until the regulation came out about being a registered money broker crap, then I moved onto other things.

It's safe to say at least some of [these]( people want bitcoins. The UK is the closest thing in the world to a police state, I suppose you think that's a good thing? calling what has been happening "hacking" is like saying that your little brother who posted "I'm gay" on your facebook wall because you left it open on your browser hacked you. Bitcoin has NEVER been hacked. If this scares the extremely ignorant away from bitcoin, all the better. they would have just contributed to it's demise anyways. But I have to agree on your last point, playing the market as it stands on MtGox is like taking candy from children, but the children are other wannabe speculators, not people who actually understand what bitcoin is.

Although it's unlikely to happen, I would be in favor of it. It would be much better for bitcoin, since in a dispersed network of small miners is healthier than a few hubs of huge hashpowerhouses.

Wouldn't it have been a lot less shady if he had waited until there was at least a little interest in the currency before releasing the mining software and mining along with a group of people, instead of releasing info about it and immediately mining 1 million BTC before anyone even know what he was talking about?

This. We need to make use of spotlight while we have it. If Bitcoin doesn't deliver while the mainstream crowd is watching, it may be a long while before they look our way again.

Ahh, honesty. So refreshing to see it on Reddit.

The future is inevitable, what that actually entails is open to interpretation.

They would be biting their own heads off if they attack bitcoin.

NO currency has intrinsic value, unless you use food and shelter as a currency. If the user of the currency does not attribute value to it, it is worthless to him. Hence why natives a few hundred years ago gave solid gold in exchange for a few raggedy blankets, hats, etc.

The point is not censorship, if you walk into a church trying to sell refrigerators the people there are not going to want to hear it. A place to talk about Bitcoin is not a place to push anti-government propaganda.

And we'll all be dead by then too.

Uhh first off the guy managed to get a mayor to accept bitcoin, when was the last time you got someone of influence to do the same?
It's obvious to you that bitcoins are worth something, but to the politician that gets business propositions every 2 hours its a feat if you catch his attention genuinely.
And what makes you assume he is younger then you? A lighthearted compliment?

Learn you must to reddit, young Padawan.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:54:48
Good luck convincing billions of people of that. Worth is not determined by usefulness alone, it's my mass consensus.
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:48:35
Well then you are taking intrinsic value into account as well, I'm speaking strictly about monetary value.
And even if we use your example where the trade is in fact for only part of the cow, the part you trade


along with the rest of the cow you still have, THAT is my point.

Bitcoin's functionality and usefulness is not hindered by US policy. It's illegal to use in Uncle Sam's house? Guess what, the rest if the world keeps on chugging. If the us opposes bitcoin, the boat leaves without them. A bloodless coup occurred the moment bitcoin was functional, it's superior and bound to take over by the simple fact that its superior to fiat and has the perfect framework to be a global currency. Bitcoin in blowing up in china, and we haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg on this one.

Yeah and chopsticks will be in demand when the Flying Spaghetti Monster comes back to rapture us to the pasta bowl.

If you keep making a point to say that bitcoin is enemy of the government, laws, and regulation, do you honestly think that it will ever succeed? You think the people in power will ever respect and let it thrive? If anything, you're the naive one here, sir.

That estimate is Under the current restricting system that has the 50k cap.
Now bitcoin comes along...
