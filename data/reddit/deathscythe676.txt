welcome back Bitcoin, I've missed you :)
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:00:39
Watching the GBP/USD fall, you rarely get to see a "real" currency have such dramatic movement over the course of a few hours. It's almost acting like a cryptocurrency :)
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:32:12
All of that said, do you really need the $1200 in fiat being only 16? Put it back into bitcoin, store the private keys securely offline and leave it alone for 2 years. You probably won't be disappointed in 2019.

If you want to divest, Maybe only cash one one BTC instead of all of it. I try to never "sell everything" of a particular asset (stock, crypto, etc). I always leave a little bit just in case.
Most of the anxiety I experience when dealing with crypto tends to originate from the unworldly amount of FUD that's posted all over the internet. Both Reddit threads can be downright toxic. I sometimes need to take "internet-breaks" for a week or two and just go outside or just do something else. 
I think don't sell all of it, leave a little bit as a long term hodl. Secure your keys offline in a place you don't need to worry about. and leave it be for a few years.

Yea guys. You all have plenty of time to prepare. I want some high quality 9000 memes. No weak shit please.

Impossible to know. Anyone who says they might know hasn't a clue. That being said, only invest what you are willing to loose. 
Opinion: 
(If you buy and HODL i don't think you'll be disappointed)
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:39:04
+1 on this. Even though Bitcoin and other crypto's have been around for years there's no saying it can't all "go to zero" some day. It's still high-risk. If you divest 15-30% depending on where you live and lifestyle you might be able to put a down payment on a decent house and if the worst happens you'll still have a roof over your head. 
If you're first house is already handled consider a second and start generating passive income.

It's a much smaller, much more limited order book. So a smaller amount of incoming money can clobber all of the sell orders. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:28:00
Only as long as that $2500 is something you're willing to loose. Buy it, store it in a place where you control the private keys, and leave it alone for a few years. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:09:19
Preventing a fair discussion is far more dangerous than any potential hard-fork. People need the ability to make educated decisions for themselves. 
Let them see both sides of any discussion and decide what FUD to filter or embrace. This censorship is setting a terrible example.

Ok so lets say that they actually get that phase of the project off the ground and this isnt just vaporware:
--Do I have to mine? Do I have to use their miner? Or Can I just pay outright in BTC for the 'ad filtering service'
--Do content providers and major advertising agencys need to cooperate with 21inc. to make this happen? 
--Would the actual user experience be some sort of cloud-based proxy you configure your browser to use?
--Any project time-frame? ETA?

There are hodl-ers in the bitcoin community where one of the main use cases for bitcoin is it being a "store of value".
They're not concerned with using it to buy a cup of coffee, but using it to regain control of their assets. These individuals (myself included) might be worried that with a rushed or botched usaf deployment will create such bad press for bitcoin that the value will plummet to unrecoverable levels. 
If you're not on Reddit everyday, which most of the bitcoin population is NOT, they don't want to know or care about the politics behind bitmain, usaf, core devs, etc. they want bitcoin to work the same way tomorrow as it does today. 
I'm very concerned about usaf, the speed it's being pushed, (two months? Really?!?), the egos on each side, and the tribal propaganda being pushed on both sides of the issue to try and sway opinion.
I've been in the space for a long time, have watched lots of shit come and go, but this one really worries me. Trying to usaf segwit into existence seems like a very risky play. 
Note: I am all for segwit. Just not in this way.
And because of this risk I've started to reduce my btc holdings into "safer" assets (even if that means paying capital gains taxes) before august.
Watch this post get downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:14:28
This is silly. And will just bog down their already overloaded staff and delay real support issues for real customers that have real tech support concerns. 
I'm a fan of Coinbase and have worked with their excellent support staff on several issues before. Yes sometimes it takes awhile but that's the reality. 
Spamming them does the community as a whole a disservice.
They assumably already have a stance on usaf and bip148. But don't feel ready to inform you of what that is yet.

I actually love the look and build of the ledger nano but I actually chose to stick with Trezor because their code base is open source. (Am I correct with this?)

look at bitstamp 1d candles: $2250 - 2938 in a 24 hour period. 
$688 in a day. That's bitcoin for you.

You would have had over 51% of the hash network and that would have created serious security concerns. Probably hampering the natural growth of the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:51:49
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:17:06

@_date: 2017-07-29 09:20:29
It stopped being a debate about scaling a long time ago and instead became a battle for power/control for the future of bitcoin's direction. 
This latest BCC nonsense is a response to them loosing the UASF/BIP91 ultimatum imposed by the users which finally forced the miner's hands to activate Segwit via BIP-141. 
Imagine the immature kid that looses monopoly flipping over the table and ruining the game for everyone else still playing. 
In that other btc forum, 99% of the white noise is done by less than 1% of the people. They socially engineer their posts and arguments so it seems like they have a much larger user base. 
It really is unfortunate. Bitcoin as a technology is hard enough for new users to understand. If new users discover that board before they have a real grasp on the tech they risk being mislead, confused and manipulated. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:32:41
if only one pool has 100% hashpower, does that mean bitmain can 51% attack themselves? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:53:53
Maybe down the road, but there will be a ton of uncertainty, doubt and inaccurate mainstream media coverage on the subject. Money will leave both chains in the short term.
