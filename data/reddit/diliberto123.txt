Right so unless you need to desperately use it, don’t

Are you putting in 100$ a week or every 2 weeks Or are you buying a set amount of btc let’s say idk .001 btc. How do you determine when to sell? One could argue that if you’d hold the btc you’d make more money the longer you hodl. I understand that you’re doing it to pay off debt but how do you know when to sell and how much of your portfolio are you selling

Wow thanks
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:43:49
But what's a good amount to start with?

What's considered a lot?

I agree and it’s definitely a good idea to get rid of that interest rate but how do you actually know when to sell? I’ve been taking stock classes for a a couple of months now and usually I’d be looking at indicators to know when to sell but they don’t really work with crypto.
To be honest with you I actually I have a lil mining computer that’s paid itself off and I’m torn whether or not to hodl or increase the mining capabilities with the profit. If I were to upgrade then I’d be risking the potential growth of the coin but I’d be making more a day

Is it still worth investing in? And if so how much should I invest?
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:42:13
I remember when people kept saying that at 20 k 
Then at 18
Eventually everyone in that discord ran lol, the few that stated continued to say that
Others said it would constantly look
Regardless my atmospheric diving suit is already on

My exchanges where you buy btc require the same standards as banks and every wallet I’ve used has transaction fees and usually takes longer than my bank transactions
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:16:25
Going any examples that I can look at/use
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:26:25
Couldn’t they just ban the banks from making transactions with crypto exchanges
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:37:05
The exchange rate are terrible for those
