But it's not their fault -- it's a flaw in the nature of coffee that they've graciously discovered for the community.

Actually deadxilence was right. We can confirm this without any external information:
-- deadxilence says that the price is about .000016 if deadxilence is correct  
-- it is true that the price is about .000016 if deadxilence is correct  
-- therefore deadxilence is correct  
-- the price is about .000016 (QED)

That would enrich us as a community... by about one Satoshi

No. They're saying you can submit a transaction with an altered txid, which can be abused when someone is keeping track of their payments and for some reason the original version doesn't survive.  Transaction malleability is a bad thing, but it's not nearly as broad a problem as they make it sound and it's been known for a while.

I wish he could have made his point without the hyperbole.

This is a terrible way to measure the viability of salts, since it is completely  different process for a completely different purpose.

I think you missed the first half of DeCiB3l's comment. Yes, hard drive manufactures use base-10-based unit trickery, but "Size on disk" does not relate to that; it has to do with file systems allocating space by indivisible blocks.

I actually know 4 people who use Windows Phone.
They all have parents who work at Microsoft though...

The fastest and easiest way to get your money out of Gox is probably to hack their wallet.

The space of possible rules seems large, though. Especially with the narrow generalizations of the rules you're basing your entropy estimates on.

I have good memories trading with them up until they kept several hundred of my BTC when they were hacked...
@_date: 2014-02-05 11:48:48
That would eliminate fees, and guarantee the system would die as block rewards decreased... But other than that it sounds fantastic!
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:44:46
They also made a lot of money being hacked back in 2011; they kept several hundred of my BTC with their "account verification" sham.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:13:48
That doesn't solve this problem.

They lost an unspecified amount of money due to a bug in their software which allowed people to withdraw the same bitcoin balance multiple times.

Just use libbitcoin or something, you can read lines from stdin and test whether they produce a given address in a few lines of C++.

Non thread-safe code running in parallel.
\- Trading process checks balance (balance = X) to make sure enough available for trade  
- Withdrawal executes  
- Trading process sets new balance = X - 0.0001

That's allowed; in fact it's the default. Offering a reward for upvotes is what's banned.

True, the scammer couldn't have done this with bitcoin... but most people still need to get fiat somehow.

I don't think the winning rule would be in that set, though. OP said it was "more obscure" than "capitalize every third letter"; all of the rules in your set are about the same complexity as capitalize every 3rd.
One of the examples OP gave that is more complex than that is "add ((*)) after the second vowel in any word" -- it seems like the set of rules of that complexity could add many more bits to the pick step, since they could select many different subsets of the 42 characters.

Is it really fraud if he's this upfront about it?
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:03:34
It means you can't check whether your payment has gone through only by txid. That sucks, but you can check whether the txouts spent successfully; the APIs for it just aren't as direct. It's not exactly the end of the world.

I'm getting 18s for a similar amount of phrases in C++, running 1 thread on a very old laptop -- so your performance seems right for those operations. Technically you could eliminate 2 SHAs and 1 Base58 since you could compare the RIPEMD160 output rather than the display-formatted address, but since that's less than a factor of 2 your time may be better spent optimizing your rule generator.
Edit: I'm seeing ~14s for the same benchmark when comparing by hash160, so the speedup is modest

Just like how if your atoms line up just right, you could fall through the earth. It's "possible" but don't worry about it.

If everyone's doing that, we should do the opposite!
