That should be up to a jury to decide, not cavalierly introduced during his trial.

He didn't say the internet was a fad. He said when it's all said and done, the internet will have about the same economic impact as the fax machine. The fax has some ground to make up, but it's not over yet.

About a year ago I did a ton of research into this.  The net is, the total volume of what scholars estimate are the black market transactions versus BTC volume as a whole is very, very small.  I feel confident saying it is not black market driving the BTC market.
But your questions is where BTC would be without SilkRoad.  Without the awareness it brought, and a place to spend the coins, we would have seen the death of BTC.  At this point in time, black market can disappear (it won't) and BTC would survive.

Please do yourself a favor and take your time, don't rush things, and thoroughly research all of this.  I can tell from your post you don't understand the concepts well.  If you try and jump in right now you will either lose your money or get scammed out of your money.  Take your time.  You won't miss out on any opportunity.

What exactly doesn't look good? We expect this after he judge's order, right? This looks exactly correct.
