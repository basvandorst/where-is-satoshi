Set up 2FA and use Bittrex, click the wallet tab and then you will see coins. There is a small
icon on the left where you can send and deposit tokens or BTC. Once you click it, it will allow you to generate an address, this is where you send your tokens or BTC. Each coin will have its own unique address, so don’t send Bitcoin to a Litecoin address or vice  versa. Once you buy other tokens with BTC they will show up in your wallets sections.
Start with a little bit and play around.

At this point I would be content if Bitcoin just stayed the same, no seg-wit, no big-block nonsense. If users want these features they can attempt to reach consensus with an altcoin. I don't see a future for Bitcoin where consensus on major protocol changes will ever be reached. I use BTC as a store of value and view it as a long term investment vehicle. This is based on the economic principles of supply and demand, with a kicker of ever-increasing scarcity, not a killer app or mass adoption at some point in the future. As someone who has followed these debates from the beginning, I have come to realize that neither side has been compelling in their arguments.

Hashrate is a trailing indicator at best over the past 2yrs in regard to price action. It also kept surging through 2014 while the price was dumping. Short of a complete crash, hashrate will continue to rise and difficulty will continue increasing regardless of price moving forward.

Haha, the fact she brings up mining difficulty shows a complete lack of understanding. There is no correlation between mining difficulty and the Bitcoin ETF.

If you look at the few people who actually understand what Bitcoin is and where it's going (the visionary types) they have all come out in support of core. Those who support a blocksize increase seem to only care about the short term gains, publicity for themselves, or use the argument that Bitcoin will never reach the masses without a block size increase. These people remind me of the global warming crowd that has been telling us the world is doomed and that we will all be underwater in 10 years,  neither will happen.

There is no such thing as a closed loop in this system. We are all only holding private keys until the next person/organization has them, or they are lost forever. This thing is too big for any particular case use/methodology, etc to take hold, the UAHF was a great example of that. It doesn't matter what any of us do, demand is growing daily and in the Information Age it has become impossible to suppress the truth. Bitcoin has become unstoppable, cryptocurrencies are beginning to rule the world.

Been waiting years for this, have mentioned it to banks many times. The only issue I see is how to account for volatility. If the price drops 20% or more in a day, it could be a disaster for a financial institution,  govt regs re: minimum bank holdings will be a major hindrance here for underwriting . There would need to be something along the lines of a 200 moving average price and perhaps once it drops X% below this price there would be a margin call.

With you 100%, was not a supporter of the UAHF initially but I now view it as a game changing event that will likely happen again and again. That being said I think most users of r/btc are trolls and just overall angry people, so it is easy to disagree with their ideology. I think only a short-sighted mind can't see that both chains will succeed over time. Haven't sold a single BTC or BCC/H and don't plan on it.

An ETF will provide greater stability to the Bitcoin space. It is the greatest form of approval that US regulators can give. Anyone with a good reputation and resources can file to have and manage their own ETF,  I believe some have already begun the process for both an Ethereum and Litecoin ETF respectively. There will be an auditing process in place to ensure that X amount of BTC is under the control of an officer with authority to mananage the ETF. As for volume/transactions this is simply a matter of supply and demand and prices will adjust accordingly. All transactions will be on-chain. I am more interested in the derivative and insurance markets that I believe will flourish once ETF approval is granted. An ETF will allow large institutions and funds to invest in Bitcoin whereas they are currently prohibited. This will likely play out the same way as did the first Gold ETFs that were granted approval.

can handle any shock. In a hyperinflation or global conflict scenario, all bets are off in terms of price action. But I am certain that these events will only strengthen BTC over time. It is truly antifragile in its properties.
There will be shocks coming, govt’s will likely try to ban it and jail citizens and some point. It is built to last and will be here longer than any nation state. In most tech the motto is move fast and break things, Bitcoin will move slow and break everything.

Though he is not perfect, I would say he's spot on about 95% of the time. Mainstream media is irrelevant as there simply aren't enough knowledgeable  people involved who understand this at a level to have a proper debate. (Brian Kelly of CNBC is a rare exception) and he schooled Robert Schiller last week. Furthermore, once someone has a clear understanding of Bitcoin there really isn't much left to debate in terms of its disruptive and transformative nature.

The first ETF will likely be on BATS not NYSE, the exchange itself is irrelevant. An ETF in this space will allow for pension funds and other institutional investors to enter, whereas they are currently prohibited. It will also allow for options trading and other insurance products to flourish. Overall the approval of an ETF should be a huge boon for all cryptocurrencies. It is in effect  the highest level of approval from regulators.

This is all hearsay and speculation, no one can speak on satoshi's intentions as even he was unsure of the future.

We all want Bitcoin to succeed, but miners will never lead in this endeavor as they don't have a common goal. Leave the thinking to the big boys.

As someone who has been holding and accumulating since 2013, I have no desire to ever sell my Bitcoin ( I am 37 as well). I have strong banking relationships with several US banks/brokerages (chase, citi, wells, schwab). I have contacted all of them through the years and even as recently as this month, about adding Bitcoin wallets or at the very least coinbase integration. They have definitely become more receptive in their replies, where in the past there was animosity, there is now a sense of intrigue. This is to be expcected at this stage in the cycle (2nd mass wave adoption). Once major banks view crypto holdings as a form of collateral I then plan on borrowing fiat against these [once proper safeguards are put into place]. At the end of the day, there is no reason to ever cash out unless absolutely neccassary. When you do, it is your responsibility to pay taxes, if you are smart it will only be on capital gains.

Bitcoin will be here regardless of your fears and it does not to be an alternative to fiat. Bitcoin's "killer app" is store of value and economic freedom and it's achieved this in a spectacular way. In the future there will be thousands of Blockchains all serving a particular purpose. All coffee may be purchased with coffeecoin for all we know. Bitcoin will be the economic foundation of everything, even more important than Governments/Central Banks. This will happen with or without any scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:07:05
Don't believe any nonsense you hear, Coinbase is prob the best bet in the U.S. for long term investing. Sure "you may not control your Bitcoin" but do you control your $ when it's in Chase? I've been holding since 2013 and keep the majority of my BTC with Coinbase (2013) and Gemini (2016) Only keep a small portion in a core wallet and some in breadwallet. There will always be a need for a trusted 3rd party to convert to fiat, so far it's these 2. Once Chase starts offering crypto wallets, I will move some of my Bitcoin there, and so on.

Coinbase doesn't owe anyone an explanation and August 1 doesn't mean anything. I hold many BTC with them and really don't care what they do. This thing will play itself out with users making the final decision, the reality is most users buy and hold. The whole scalability debate is nonsense and I think the majority have stopped paying attention to it, use an Alt if you want to buy coffee.

U are making a lot of assumptions. What happens in short term is irrelevant. I hold long term and only convert to acquire Alts or participate in ICOs. I will wait it out and end holding the chain that has the majority of users, that's the smart money move and that is what CB will do.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:18:13
Good standard practice is a relative term, I have significant crypto holdings. Too much at stake for me to be solely responsible. I believe more in Coinbase's and Gemini's ability to deal with any hack and make it right than my personal ability to avoid being hacked.

@_date: 2017-07-11 17:58:35
I find these articles funny, as a long time holder, I have no interest in using Bitcoin for everyday purchases and I don't know many people looking to spend their Bitcoin. I use Bitcoin as a store of value or to speculate, Alts, ICOs. Have used purse a couple times, works well for large purchases, but can backfire. Bitcoin will become mainstream when our small minority or users/holders convince the rest of world that what we see is the correct path. It's only a matter of time, the beauty here is once you cross over, there's no going back. It's equiavalent of finding out the world is round when everyone still thinks it's flat.

Though I am not a fan of The UAHF I doubt BCC will crash if ETC is any indication. At the very least take your free coins if your are holding BTC and see what happens. There is no downside risk to this and I personally will view BCC as an alt coin. This is simply our form of governance.
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:58:21
No you're missing the point, I don't care nor do I have the time. I believe CB will do what's best, they've earned my trust since 2013. I also use Gemini, Bittrex and use multiple trezor's it's just not an issue for me.  Though we are in the same boat, your problem is not my problem and that is my point.

I have never sold a single Bitcoin, and have been holding since 2013, buying consistently up until my last purchase a couple weeks ago. Will continue to buy as long as I can. I see Bitcoin's market cap inevitably exceeding $1T, the upside is staggering. Hold a bunch or Alts too, never sold. In my opinion this party hasn't even started yet.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:26:09

The entire world economy can fit into Bitcoin. The # of coins is irrelevant. In the future they may have to make each coin divisible by a billion or 10 billion instead of the current 100 million Satoshis per coin. Milli-Satoshi's anyone?
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:59:58
Disagree wholeheartedly. I believe some of these ICOs will be immensely relevant in the future. There is a real aim to solve problems that Bitcoin cannot currently cope with. To disregard this new breed of ICO so early on would be like disregarding Instagram or Snapchat because they were first used by teenagers. Not to mention the development teams behind some of these tokens, these are people who could have gone into other tech fields but they chose this as their way of making a difference. In the Information Age, I now longer need a government agency to protect me from myself. The more success that ICOs see, the more of a boon for Bitcoin. I can't wait for Apple to create their own ICO someday, perhaps as a way to hold equity ownership and or buy products/services.
@_date: 2016-07-29 20:01:45

The only plausible event is the complete destruction of Earth. As long as people are alive and capable of communicating there will be a need for Bitcoin and someone will be able to run a node. Eventually there will be nodes spread throughout the solar system and beyond, at that point it will never die. Even in the unlikely event encryption is broken by quantum computing I believe there will be safeguards implemented including blacklisting of coins in order to save the system.

None of this is relevant to me as I don't care about privacy. Whoever buys the home will have the title recorded with LA county and I will pay any taxes I need to in fiat once the sale is complete.

First I've heard of the term but I firmly believe this is the case. Tough sell to someone who doesn't grasp the full implications of what this means.

Absolutely agree, I have contacted my bank numerous times about this. All this negative nonsense about "banks are evil" is short sighted. Banks exist because people want a safe place to store their money, but also to offer loans to those who need it. Businesses and individuals will always need access to extra capital, one way or the other crypto banks will thrive. I'm a huge fan of the Waves Platform, it offers a decentralized exchange and allows you to lease tokens. Basically allows anyone to become a bank. Getting banks on board will be a boon for the space.

I'm with you on Potcoin, still keep BTC as my primary holding. I am bullish on Alts that can fit a specific need and have good marketing. Saw the Dennis Rodman thing and bought 2 BTC worth, plan on holding just like I do with my BTC.
edit after downvote: fair enough, and let me reaffirm I am still a Bitcoin Enthusiast. But I also remember viewing both Dogecoin and Ethereum as pipe dreams initially, guess what? They are both still here and thriving. The PotCoin team took the initiative, spent the money, put in the work. It's very easy to hate but I will give them credit where it is do, good work guys, and good luck.

Think they are missing the point, they are including Bitcoin in a "large swath" of assets that are currently increasing. There is no correlation between the price of gold, the S&amp;P and Bitcoin. Crypto is increasing because we are in the 2nd wave of mass adoption, it's a much bigger, world-wide picture. This is a unique situation where value dinosaurs of the past are falling and a new asset class of decentralized value is being created before our very eyes. Money does not lie. Forget the front page, cryptocurrencies should have their own section in WSJ.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:12:03
Has no correlation, there is always money to put to work. This is more about risk tolerance, patience, and a vision for a future where information is the most valuable asset/resource. A correlation you can bank on however is: as this space grows, all other assets WSJ covers will lose some of their luster. Some much more than others...
