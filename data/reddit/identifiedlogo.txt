I think we have to differentiate between the Blockchain as a revolutionary technology versus the nature of money. World FIAT currencies have value because they are backed by the state and there is an actual cash flow that can come by investing the FIAT currency in a cash generating investment. There is no reason to believe the states will give up the power of the currency. All major nations collapse happened because of currency devaluation ,Germany, Soviets etc... No matter how much we justify the legitimacy of BTC as a currency, States currency will rule regardless. Any other scenario is completely revolutionary and no one is ready for that. You can listen to Vitalik himself discuss Cryptos, he is not focused on the value but on ideas projects can support. The only people pumping prices like McCaffee are out there for personal benefit-listen to McCaffe explain why BTC will go up, it is out of disregard for the status quo. That is fine but we live in reality.

How can you say that? These are really smart educated people who made billions. Unless you are completely ignorant of things you don't know or you don't appreciate where they are coming from to completely dismiss educated opinion. Even if you disagree with their claim, understand the basis for it. This is not a matter of personal opinion it is a science you can break down and analyze with 100yrs of economic data.
And you are attributing the quote to mean the opposite. Greed and being risk averse is equivalent to "being agreeable", the opposite which  being cautious and understanding fundamentals is having sound judgment.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:18:15
I agree. Even if we accept everything about BTC, it can never be used as a currency because of the deflationary nature. So I question the utility. The only utility outside of that is probably for trading securities, property rights, some expensive contracts, arts , etc... and that is a limited market. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:25:23
This terms are not upto interpretation. There is a strict definition. I am not going to argue why BTC has intrinsic value. Nobody is even sure Gold has any intrinsic value and it has been around forever. No one who owns BTC will spend it. There is no way around that, so the value of BTC as instrument for transaction is not there.

There is no economic basis for BTC. The only claim is the unlimited demand we claim will be there sometime in the future. Nobody really knows how, but we claim demand will keep growing for some unknown reason. Because at this point BTC has no utility meaning no intrinsic value to justify the price-which is the economic fundamental for a commodity like gold, oil etc...in that case it is like Gold because, nobody knows what the price of gold is either.

If bitcoin manages to beat the bubble claim for a long enough period, it would be a miracle. Traditional fundamental economists and investors understand asset bubble and the people involved in a trade. And every sign indicates BTC is a bubble. Understanding the basis of BTC and block chain doesn't change the nature of a bubble. Not defending these guys but they are stating basic economic principle that has been there in history. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:21:40
There is a major uncertainty as far as the States accepting it for circulation. In addition to other coins with large benefits and bTC unlimited fork. If JP Morgan starts printing its own coin, it could be the end of BTC
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:58:04
You are missing my point. BTC can do all that I get that. But in the world we live in controlled by trade and commerce, FIAT currency is the only way governments can sustain dominance. There will be a major collapse before BTC is worth more than the Dollar or yuan or any other major FIAT currency. The Soviet union failed because of currency collapse so did the Weimar Republic. There is no point repeating BTC talking point without addressing the reality. if your answer to FIAT dominance is to get rid of the government then you are not grounded in reality or fundamentals because at that point you have bigger problems than BTC. At some point the states will shut it down if it becomes too risky to their position in the world. Think Petro Dollar and what it meant in history and the amount of money and people who died to sustain it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:04:06
I agree. The hedge funds are basically being asked by their investors if they can invest in BTC. So the hedge fund has no other option but to trade it. So money will pour in. The people investing at this point are the FOMO croud, that may push price to 25K or 100K, there is no rationalizing this. Just invest money you are willing to lose. If you bought in sub $3000 you should be fine, but the rest is just speculation and rumors and nothing founded in reality. I can't buy BTC the same way I buy Apple stock. Apple generates cash flow, btc on the other hand is just promising future value, it may be worth $1MM or Zero.

That means nothing. With the current price and market cap you would think BTC is on par with FIAT currency. It doesn't have the market penetration to validate the current value. It is still an experiment which the banks and governments can kill in a second.

The issue in most developing countries is access to the banking system itself. Like the M-Pesa Vodafone/Vodacom money transfer system solved that because you just need a cellphone number and any retail agent can serve as a bank for deposits, and it is spreading all over developing countries. Brick&amp;Mortars will go that means much more streamlined FIAT transaction system backed by conglomerates, which BTC can not compete with for various reasons. BTC adoption is making that transition possible. But BTC by iteslef may be capped within internet systems in narrow corners.

@_date: 2017-08-31 20:22:27
You are right. I would rather be in stocks than gold for assets. But when it comes down to it Gold has much more utility than Bitocoin at the moment, simple fact that you can use it to make physical stuff, you can exchange for anything. It is industrial material for almost everything used daily, 10% of industrial feed and international banks hoarding it. So gold has material value. As far as using it for exchange, honestly I will be interested in Gold backed digital currencies, or the Goldmoney mastercards.

Well there is no product that has gone up by 700% since last year in terms of dollar, Inflation is not rising fast enough actually for the fed. It is not the CPI going up, it is earning going down or stagnant salaries the problem in that regard. Not really the same thing.

Wth, how is that smart, what if bitcoin goes in to bare market for years. Can new investors handle 100% wipeout of there non existent savings? Idea is you diversify in to savings and assets. People have No idea what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is speculative market as risky as they come. All these new investors are going to be really disappointed.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:34:03
I still have hard time with your comparison of BTC to Gold as a store of wealth. BTC is highly volatile and unpredictable, Gold is pretty much a brick that holds value for 100's of years price held for 30 years. Even the Lanisters have been paying in Gold/jk.  I can't think of a scenario gold losing significant value, but many for coins.
The reason FIAT, bonds are money is because they are backed by countries and confidence among the countries exchanging those papers that currencies will remain stable. I don't see that breaking any time soon, if that breaks down for whatever reason, then we have bigger problems. In addition governments take FIAT for taxation.
The only reason BTC has value right now is because lots of people are willing to accept BTC for FIAT, with essentially zero utility.
I have invested in BTC but cautiously. I don't see utility for it unless, the blockchain is fully integrated in to 90% of all activities and the price becomes stable. I have some ether for the programmable platform which I see immediate applications for.

@_date: 2017-08-07 20:27:04
Sure, there is a crisis in the horizon, no body knows what will trigger it, but it is there, all the big hedge fund managers are saying it.  It is a crisis in the bond market, and there is no Fed solution to it. Anything they do will crash the dollar further. BTC may not be it though. It will be some coin the gov can control. Until then you buy at the lows and sell taking profit at intervals.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:41:05
True. Your risk is losing all of it. You have to remember to protect the downside. Reason people invest in treasury bonds, gold, &amp; savings is because it is a guaranteed menial return but very small risk to the downside. I wouldn't trust huge saving in coins for long term holding 5-10% as they say. If you make significant returns sale some and buy huge shares of solid companies.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:04:58
That is the problem in this sub, people don't want to address the underlying issue. Nobody can clearly explain how bitcoin can advance as money. The only reason it is going up right now is because people are willing to exchange it for FIAT. FIAT currencies have value because they are backed by countries and taxes are paid with FIAT. BTC can not be compared to Gold or any physical entity, and yet people do that to make a point.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:05:57

Honestly I am Ok with that. The issue is on the Utility side what no one is addressing. OP question was regarding if this is a bubble or not, it is a bubble it will crash and rally until it gets enough penetration and its utility increases in the market place. But at this point it is a speculative asset and not money and that is ok.

@_date: 2017-11-03 13:25:47
Probably not. That trend is broken. ALTS are getting trashed since BTC started the rally. This pump is most likely related to the hard fork and extreme greed. Before the fork, until Nov 15 it may pump up to 10,000. Once people realize their two coins after the split, then fear my set in and a massive sell off may happen. Most of this money is high volume walstreet money, if it goes down it will go down hard.

The debt will never be paid, and military might may not be that big of a deal especially for China and countries may just abandon the US. As for US rising taxes and unfunded welfare programs will create issues inside US. The only reason US is sustaining this debt level is because of other countries confidence in US system, creativity and of course Military Power. Things may change quickly with declining education standards and social unrest akin to other third world countries.

@_date: 2017-09-01 03:02:09
The reasons you listed dont qualify for intrinsic value for btc. What is the value of BTC on its own, what is the value of the blockchain? The value is based on the difficulty of mining btc. I have difficulty understanding that, any other monetary entity used by humans in the past has value on its own. For example gold is a unique metal with countless practical applications, all metals same reason. Even salt had value in thr past because people needed it. I agree with the other similarities you listed. If Fiat disappears or a metor strike destroys half the planet. You need gold or some valuable material to trade goods not BTC. Use cases such as fast transactions are a definite plus, but what if the big banks impliment free instant transactions, what then? Why do we need BTC? As long as BTC needs Fiat BtC has no real value. I think.
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:31:02
There is no telling whats going to happen,  btc may become like MySpace and Yahoo, ltc, ripple etherium may become the facebook and Google. ICOs that solve problems have real utility. BTC is a monster at the moment hence a gateway, but a technologically advanced coin can topple it anytime.  Get diversified. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:42:22

@_date: 2017-09-01 02:49:25
Except for the fact that BTC has no actual value in itself. Its all based on perception and what sellers believe about btc right now. Gold or any other monetary entity has some intrinsic value, its in your cellphone, electronics, health, dental, Gold is unique metal, irreplaceable. Even Fiat as much as it is backed by governments and tax is paid by fiat has some value. As far as eliminating the banks for faster transactions, i see the utility but dont see the path for monetary use on its own.

To the moon right. If you actually fit the 2016 and 2017 data only the line will be shallower more reasonable :). I was just trying to see a straight line assuming exponential growth which is wildly optimistic.

After all you are trading. If you discount the boom and busts BTC has increased 3000% in those 9 years.

Basically... but i don't think it will break past momentum levels. This is a long ride. Whatever happens after the scaling debate, the point is we are on an exponential trend. There may be huge spike like in 2013 or a sell off but it should settle down on the resistance line (blue line) in the long term which will still give a decent ROI

Blame the guy that was poking it couple of days ago.

think about it, if the USD is tanking when the FED is tightening, there is a big problem. What happens when they decide to realx, QE, Print etc...Big problems.

Tim Ferris had him in one of his recent podcast which is worth a listen. I couldn't find hints that he is satoshi, although he was a little too quiet.

There are lots of them. Check the top 20 podcasts on itunes. And check them out and subscribe to few of them. You can't go wrong with Joe Rogan and Tim Ferris. Give those two a listen if you haven't yet.

Ha, not much really, just to indicate the past corrections and deviations from the trend.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:17:53
Hard fork or soft fork?
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:45:17
ha, can't pick and choose.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:59:04
I agree with you. This is actually assuming exponential growth on semi-log plot. I think after scaling issue is resolved, the curve may not even look remotely close to this. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:46:16
 This is not not sell off it barely moved. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:02:40
Here you go
$10K in 2019, $100K in 2021, $1M in 2023

Earlier when I saw this, It was moving forward, now it is moving backward...wtf.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:41:07
Would you like to create one?

This is not like valuing publicly traded company. You buy it because you believe it has huge potential and we are at the earliest stages, what does it matter if you get in at 2000 or 3000 if you think it will go to $40000. Just keep buying whatever you can afford and whatever  you are willing to lose. The value of bitcoin is still being formalized....its utility is similar to all monies with lots of positives.

If it doesn't split,  what's the solution to the block size problem? There needs to be a second derivative of btc, reliable altcoin...., Btc has become too heavy to work with. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:00:37
I agree with you.
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:11:45
Your block chain for some industrial printers...deal
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:30:52
I would say around 0.28%/day. Here you go 
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:20:55
You have no idea what you are talking about. Either you are grasping on little information and don't understand the details or you are listening to people with agenda. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:16:51
Ya. No. Pick up some altcoins. Btc not going anywhere
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:26:05
Looks like selloff has began.

If this is because of Etherium correcting, then it has a lot more to go. Etherium needs to drop to $150 at least.

So funny to see the $2999 and Hodl Posts on the front page at the same time.
