Up to you. What if it rises? What if it crashes? You're call my man. I would buy at 3950. But... that's a gamble. It might hit 5k in the coming days.

The time to buy will always be now. There is no perfect moment and crypto is on the rise. Therefore it's a fairly safe investment. Once mainstream adopts it will be a different story.

Right? Struggles. Lol. Author probably missed the train long ago and is upset at himself. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:40:09
So angry. Been a while eh? You should get out a bit more. It's okay foe others to be curious. You can't say you don't have the time, you clearly do. You also can't say you don't have the energy, you clearly do. Why so tough? You need a hug man?
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:19:02
You're rude! Why not help the guy out instead of criticising him and acting like a pompous pumpkin when all he's asking for is genuine help?

Bitcoin will never die! I love you.

6.6k. I like it. My guesstimate was conservative. This is the calm before the storm. Engine revving up IMHO.

TBH I am not sure but I am certain Segwit is an improvement. :) Paves the way for LN which will help  with this issue.

Nothing new. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:18:07
Wow... talk about the glass being half full. Mine is overflowing!
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:21:21
Bad advice. What happens if bitcoin reaches 6k by November? What if it fails? To each their own.

No crystal ball needed. He sees it. I do too.

All the folks downvoting are BCH fans. BTC will be victorious.

You would be insane not to.

This isn't fun. What good is a million going to do me if I have heart attack or stroke before then?
Im glad to be done with this train for a while. I sold my positions on litecoin because when China wakes up it could lead to more blood.
Too many rumors there has to be some credibility. As a former analyst I hardly trust single source information but even just rumors will kill this market. 
If an official paper is released by the PBOC we'll know for sure. Wish there were a timeline to say the least.

Let me delete and start over.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:28:53
Youre right. How do i modify?
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:10:45
Wer dumm ist, soll dumm bleiben. :P
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:07:38
Yep. More blood.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:34:04
LMAO. You must be a late Millennial or Generation Z.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:04:37
Why would anyone stay in the market for 5-10% daily gains when its likely about to drop 30%? Im out. Quite at peace with my decision. Ill be abke to sleep tonight at least.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:03:24
Good for you... us. When PBOC releases the paper the risk for $2-3 gains at thid time arent enough to risk a $15-20 drop. 3k Bitcoin is easily possible upon release.
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:13:55
Okay. Don't let your ego get in the way of making a logical decision.
