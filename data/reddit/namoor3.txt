You have to buy them? You can't earn them?

Then the question should be: Can i pay Using Bitpay with only 1 confirmation without much problems?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:30:55
It has been confirmed, Though it took a while. Thanks!!

That's the only website where i can find what i want, And they use bitpay as the main &amp; only way to pay with btc. Thats besides the point, what can i possibly do?
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:20:19
Oh Well.  Thanks anyways.

All of them give me less than 90-95%, So i can't buy it with these.

I'm pretty sure it only withdraws when i have $20, Not $9...

I'm traveling, &amp; I turned off my mining PC so i'd rather cash out $20 than let it rot on my wallet for a month or so. Plus i like the idea of using my BTC that i mined using my PC with almost no work to pay for my subscriptions
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:56:36
Doesn't it only withdraw when i get $20 rather than a random number such as $9?
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:21:23
Whats your PayPal Address? I'll go first 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:27:48
Ah ok, Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:20:00
What? :P
I'm even willing to go first if they are active on this subreddit
I think you read this wrong... I'm buying $1 not $19
How could this be a scam?

I'm underage for most jobs near me, 15
@_date: 2017-07-13 05:57:06
Really? I Can't find out how.
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:23:38
Ah. Cheers dude! That's kind of you :)
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:20:03
Then how do i get paid out?
