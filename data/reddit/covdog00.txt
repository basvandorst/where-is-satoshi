I made this choice eight years ago and bought 10k in gold and silver, not going to make the same mistake twice.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:45:59
Whats your point?
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:13:22
Do people really fall for this scam?
If he could make this much money, he would have no need for other peoples as it would just dilute his own profits
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:45:45
If you believe the bitcoin has zero value why are you even in this sub? If you're looking for someone to buy your bitcoins then put them up for sale, I'll be happy to buy them from you. Thanks
@_date: 2018-06-09 19:24:13
500000 BTC was traded in the last 24 hours so this would be nothing unusual

I'm unsure of what Abra is but if it uses the same method it should work on trezor

I feel that we need to hold above $7k for a few days, or we will be soon testing the $6k lows of February again

How is this FUD? Do you even understand how bitcoins work? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:36:01
OMG, This is the first time I have heard this information! I must sell all my bitcoins.....
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:44:52
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:02:14
Your bitcoins are stored on the blockchain, not on your ledger. So they are already in the US or anywhere else you may want to travel.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:41:48
This is FUD. Mods please delete!
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:17:56
I think you need to see a doctor for memory loss, in your last post you said it was going down to under 7500.
I'm sure you will deny this and delete your post in under an hour like you do every single time. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:33:24
I live in a country where 1 bitcoin is equal to 100-200 wages, does this mean that you will donate to me?
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:38:06
I would have given you a few bitcoins but you didn't use a segwit address
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:14:50
A stopped watch is correct twice a day, so just keep posting the same thing every day. I'm sure you will be right once in awhile.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:57:17
If you really believe that bitcoin is worth 30k a coin why would you want to stop the 'FUD machine' when you can carry on buying cheaper bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:11:19
wunderbaah, how much have you actually invested in bitcoin? You seem not to be coping well with the current trading value.
If you truly believe in bitcoin you wouldn't care about its cost in fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:47:01
You just said that it was about to dump less than 30 minutes ago, but you deleted that post and now say the opposite
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:05:41
People will take advantage of the price with arbitrage
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:23:21
Which do you think is most likely to happen,  a straight run up to $500k without dropping once in value or that bitcoin goes up and down $500 in value a thousand times?
A hodler bets on the first option a trader bets on the second. In both options, they make the same amount of money, but as option 2 is more likely the trader gets to drive a Lambo before the hodler.

The adverts you receive via AdSence are targetted personally for you based on the websites you visit. If you didn't view these sites, you wouldn't have gotten these adverts.

Sorry but you have to be a joke poster, seriously you can't expect anyone to think that your sane after this post.
But just for a laugh, please tell us who you would petition to get these bitcoins moved between addresses.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:41:32
I would have donated but you didn't use segwit
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:30:10
How long is it going to be before you delete this post and say it's going to $9000?
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:45:13
The current transaction speeds and fees have nothing to do with the LN. Maybe you should learn a bit more about bitcoin before you invest
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:06:49
You forgot to delete your post from a few hours ago saying we are going up to $9000
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:40:15
Probably at the next halving event
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:39:04
Someone needs to do it, you keep deleting and editing your posts, then denying that you ever said such things.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:02:22
Everybody saw that you said Pump, that's why you deleted your comment. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:04:28
If you know about gdax why are you even buying via coinbase?
Coinbase is for people who need a more straightforward interface, or credit card buys and you pay a premium for the use of that.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:13:48
And once this 51% attack happens how much do you think that bitcoin is going to be worth after the community forks away from that blockchain?
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:26:59
Also owning just 1 bitcoin would put you in that 4% of the top wallets.
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:52:39
Wow you can edit your post when you were called out. Maybe just delete your comments and try again?
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:09:08
If it carried on at the same rate for the next 8 hours, it would turn the 27k into 729k and add a further 8 hours that would then turn into 19.68 million. If carried onto the next day it would be upto 1.5 billion. Think about it, if it did indeed work like this why would he tell anyone? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:55:26
It wouldn't drop down forever, people would start buying once they think its cheap again
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:01:48
Why do you keep posting this? You will just edit or delete this post when you're wrong and repost the same again in an hour.
What do you hope to achieve out of this?
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:25:26
Everybody knows that you delete your old posts, If you scroll down you can see that the link is from your deleted comment from 4 hours ago.
Why would someone make a photoshop 4 hours before you made this comment?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:58:39
They are cashing out to give fiat to there kids who will use the money to buy Bitcoin, Pump Incoming!
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:12:27
At least you remembered to delete your old comments this time
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:00:20
The problem with you Goldberger isn't that you are posting TA or even that it's negative. Its the fact that you post every single type of outcome and will edit and delete your posts when it turns out to be wrong. 
You will make posts saying 'Dump incoming' after a dump has happened and when it starts to reverse you will edit the same post to say 'Pump incoming' when you get called out on this you deny it and then delete your posts. 
This is why people have a problem with you.
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:21:32
The data on the blockchain isn't viewable as an image as it has been broken into many different segmants of information. To view it you would need to know which data it is and in which order to put it to decode the image. 
It's like saying you just viewed CP if I show you a '0 and 1' You could put those 0 and 1's in the same correct order into the same program to get the same image.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:23:26
It depends on your financial circumstances, is $1k a lot for you? Personally, I've been trading the highs and lows of bitcoin and will be buying a couple more BTC if we go sub $6k. However, I'm only using money that I don't care about as its only a low percentage of my investments.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:15:44
The one you just deleted, so let me remind you 
Go ahead and deny that you said it but this is a reason why people take screenshots

If you start to print more than 21m Bitcoin you make the whole network worthless, this is a stupid proposal.

The British use the BTC/Eur exchange on Gdax as its simpler to get funds onto Gdax that way

Are you sure Larry has brought bitcoin?  There's no such thing as a Chinese bitcoin account. It sounds like he just has fiat in a custodial wallet
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:44:01
Nope, you participated in a scam, The fraction you sent to the address now has a new owner, and you will never see it again.
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:58:14
If you are after legal help, I would recommend posting in the correct subreddit that might be able to help you further, as I fail to see what exactly this has to do with bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:48:25
If you have exhausted all the legal routes you can take then the only thing left you could do is an illegal method to recover funds (I don't recommend)
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:54:10
If you look at  you can see that the current fee for the next block is around 80 sats
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:01:38
But you first sent £15k in September, why send extra funds in November and February if you never received anything after the first £15k?
Also what has this got to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:51:58
It might be boring, but it's the level I want before I'd be willing to buy a few more bitcoins
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:06:25
Maybe you should understand what bitcoin is and how to use it before you have your friend send you $28k worth of it,
A private key is free and is something that is created when you make your own bitcoin wallet. 
Coinbase isn't a bitcoin coin wallet, it's just an account that holds your bitcoins in their wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:40:10
Also, KuCoin seems to be an exchange like Gdax rather than a wallet.
With having 2 BTC, you should understand there is some risk in keeping BTC on them and maybe use your own private wallet if you need to store them safely.
 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:22:24
695,863 BTC moved in the last 24 hours
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:39:32
If you have already tried the legal route to recover funds and have been told there is nothing left; I fail to see why you are asking for extra help in this forum.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:26:46
If your suggesting that I live in my parent's basement, you are mistaken.
I've already paid off my mortgage and that of my parents.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:59:50
If you have ever found yourself needing to cash out your bitcoins to pay your bills, your mistake is that you have invested in more than you should have.
This is why you probably want regulations to save you from your own mistakes.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:59:08
If you look at the username on the giveaway, you will see it's not  but from another user. There is nothing that can be done to get your fraction back as all sends are final
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:54:43
Aren't all predictions?
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:26:42
You have posted in the wrong forum as this has nothing to do with bitcoin itself.  However, you should have taken legal action against the company to recover funds via the court system. But as its been over a year since you been made aware of the fraud, there is probably no assets left to be sold to cover your claim.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:14:08
This isn't normal, maybe post some screenshots so we can see whats going on?
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:13:26
I personally feel that the markets won't be happy until we test the 6th February lows again so around $6k.
But if you are unsure you could start to buy back in stages. So some at 6.5k, 6.25k, etc
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:28:53
Why post a scam?
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:55:40
Why would you send a further £6k and another £1k if you never received your goods after the first deposit?
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:44:42
The problem is your still thinking in fiat rather than bitcoin.
If you have one bitcoin out of the 21 million available, it doesn't matter what anybody else does in the market you still have the same one bitcoin.
This is why it doesn't need regulation.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:45:39
If there is a world war, you will be dead so it wouldn't matter
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:53:47
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:44:42
I feel that we need to test the early February lows before the market will be happy to go higher. So around 6k then bounce upwards. However, if we stay around 6k for a few days, we could go lower to 4.5-5k
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:32:33
Yes, more people are selling than buying.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:40:09
We are currently above 6.8k so there is nothing stopping you from taking profit and buying in again at a lower price if you believe MT GOX will have any effect on the price
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:28:26
Currently going through at 1 satoshi

You sell your bitcoins for euros on Gdax, then transfer the euros back to coinbase and withdraw via SEPA using the revolut banking app, the cost for using this method is entirely free if under £25k
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:05:30
When you use coinbase you don't have your own wallet on the blockchain, they pool everyone's coins together in there own wallets.
When you asked for your 2.02931784 BTC, they sent from an address that had 2.10680943 BTC and the change of 0.0774761 BTC went back into coinbase's wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:03:53
Fees are currently at 1 sat to get into the next block 
People should learn to look up there own fee rather than use the wallet default which is normaly alot higher than needed.
