I had a Firehouse Sub when I was in vacation in TX, dam good subs!
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:26:12
Whats funny about that, is I did actually look at buying sheets...
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:32:52
I, as well just purchased a wallet. Enjoy your Bitcoin!

BenQ XL2720T 27"
@_date: 2012-09-30 16:03:29
It's still worth it right now... I'd say no in a couple months.
@_date: 2012-10-05 22:06:20
my bad, thought you said buy a quad core, 8gb ram comp..

To me bitcoin represents freedom... people should be free to buy drugs. It helps bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-09-30 15:59:03
I'm pumped!

the fpga single is 80w, I have read from a bfl employee that the wattage for an asic will be lower then that.

mtgox clearly states they will freeze any account that deals with them over tor. I suggest that you don't use it if you want to keep your account. Using mtgox is your wallet, there are other options but this one works. To keep that wallet safe, buy one of their yubikey's or download google auth., no one can go into your wallet without those.

they've stated on bitcointalkforum that they want to send a mass amount out at once, which causes it to be delayed for nov. fine with me.
@_date: 2012-12-14 01:07:31
Also, they only have large.. boooo! If they had a Med, Id have one ordered already. Wear it at work :P
@_date: 2012-10-05 22:05:44
fuck that, buy a laptop, and order 10-13 ASICS. You don't need a baller computer to make money...
@_date: 2012-10-05 22:02:46
They dont have to take pictures of their own equipment.
@_date: 2012-10-05 22:04:05
I'm with murf.
@_date: 2013-08-03 19:44:52
$250+ a day, so that'd be.... 16 days. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:27:23
I'm not so sure about that.. they we're supposed to get the new test board 3/27. so that means it's highly unlikely they are close to shipping.. but to be fair. I am not an expert nor work with BFL. What do i know, right?
@_date: 2013-02-12 23:36:29
I wonder if there doing this because another delay may be on the horizon...
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:13:18
grnbrg, a well respected bitcoiner, had an unofficial twitter account for bfl, and has an inside knowledge somehow.. he had it up on his twitter.. I'm going to assume bfl had him take it down because it is not up there anymore.
@_date: 2013-08-04 23:06:03
Well, .12 kw/h = $2.88 a day
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:46:14
Above he states 6/24, and order # was in the 2600 range...
@_date: 2013-08-04 13:15:00
That's correct. I think it'll be ok. Video cards run at the same temps and they last years.  
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:18:52
This is not what they're doing. Josh has stated already, that they will dumb down the speed of the chips and send you enough units to what you paid for. i.e. you bought 60 g/h's, and they dumb them down to 30. you'll get 2 30's. at least until they get newer pcb boards.
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:45:56
If I saw this earlier, I would've drove down. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:57:54
It's great to be optimistic, but they won't be shipping within 2 weeks.. They've stated their test board had failures and are waiting on a new one which they won't get til this coming Wednesday, they then have to still ship to Chicago and back to then start assembly.. 
@_date: 2013-01-10 00:04:20
How about less andriod progress, more asic progress...
@_date: 2013-08-05 01:55:20
I should rephrase that, my set up is only at .8 kw/h an hr. so it'll be cheaper. 
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:00:30

That's 3 of the 6 singles I ordered. Order  no PSU's requested. Next order is  for 3 more. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:58:56
ordered 6/26/2012, received 8/3/2013.
@_date: 2013-08-04 13:11:46
$7900 American dollars for 6 singles. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 00:17:14
Couldn't tell ya exactly..
@_date: 2013-02-23 03:08:22
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:59:48
haven't received my 8/8/2012 order 
@_date: 2013-01-13 17:11:39
I will cancel my order of almost $20,000 if this is true... We've all waited long enough.
@_date: 2013-09-12 01:44:54
I use it to receive my coins I mine. Have 2 rather large cash withdrawals, everything works fine. Not even a lvl 2. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:40:33
my bad, that's meant to be .08..
@_date: 2013-08-03 19:43:53
They run at about 170 degrees. Noticeably warmer living room. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:31:02
Their forums, their live chat, here, and one of their well known customers has an official BFL twitter feed.
