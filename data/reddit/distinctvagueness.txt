So appartently the IRS is able to override that [ex post facto]( thing congress is held to &gt;_&gt;

I've spoken with several bankers and those aware were interested in bitcoin and claimed the banks had no specific policy regarding bitcoin or affiliated sites. I'll throw that on the antecedent pile. If you go over 10k though that'll can easily get flagged on anything.

minus $150 of course.
Although I might even get a better graphics card if one goes on sale today.

Im going to build it in an hour and play on the couch too. Calibrating? What?
@_date: 2014-08-30 09:06:05
Or build a pc with better specs for about the same cost.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:22:11
But don't forget the taxes!

You don't need to download any blockchains to move from tip wallets to exchanges to USD to your bank.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:00:38
So what about that whole ex post facto thing? They are calling for taxes on transactions on things that occurred in 2012?

Gotta pay back the people somehow. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 09:05:18
If you can build it, you get so much more bang for your buck, it's pretty simple too.

responsive != mobile-first
Good responsive would be decent for all sized screens by definition

Panic is being induced to scare the newbs. Panic is causing DDOS and more panic. 
Stop panicking people.

And now the thread of comments wanting tips begins.
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:40:36
Oh sorry, I feel like the premise is close enough to say that the amount of energy and effort is high enough (and also there is no real reward) that it won't happen. And if it did there are several ways to alter the protocol cleanly or sloppily.

Try refreshing or check back in a few minutes. I've seen this happen when it's under heavy load. Coinbase is not a good place to daytrade if you were planning on that.

The only answer for you if you are new is: badly.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:32:56
Yeah finally people are stopping that dumb rumor.
The "new" idea on why "bitcoin is broken" has been around for years. Forum thread from 2010 about this issue and a simulation attempt:

Bitcoinmarkets does not want posts like this. We are already watching the charts, no need to spam each ATH moment.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:16:26
That is not how economics work at all.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:46:21
Bitcoin goes up Bitcoin goes down. Can't explain that folks.
But seriously, it might be a shake-out of the new blood (bear trap) or a bubble popping. Time will tell.

How can I get in now that the price is falling so much? I have a coinbase account but I they ran out of coins for today.
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:06:13
Both at the same time.

The Goxdox also played a huge part in that so I wouldn't call that a real correction.

This has been discussed for years. Recently the "25% attack" is actually "a bigger issue" to most people but that has already been address since at least 2010.
tl;dr even if possible, no real profit.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:33:15
Charge-back requires regulations most people don't want. There are ways to escrow, but you need to be careful with your coins.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:49:26
We won't drop below 200 so no. This is not "bursting hard" 
And remember "folks" don't take advice from anyone here. Maybe he's looking to buy.
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:59:54
We should start a 2 BTC holder club. And have going away parties as people sell or buy. 
(2 is the mentally easy number since we can hold 1 and sell the other at double value to guarantee profit, at least tat's what I originally told myself)
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:26:44
It's only a theory being circulated not a proof. It would require significant investment and would have no reward since it would "ruin" bitcoin. And there could easily be another fork in the protocol to prevent it from doing any harm should someone waste their time bothering.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:06:54
Nice car, might want to cash out another coin to cover the speeding tickets such a red car will bring ;)
