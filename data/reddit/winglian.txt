Given that today/Tuesday is Veteran's Day, the Wounded Warrior Project  is relevant choice.

Sounds like some sort of Pokemon.

I was wondering what happened to fullnode.co. Are full nodes still important for the health of the network?

Or specifically, a single station such as  which is one of the largest public radio stations in the country to focus the impact. Also, much of KQED's content seems to be syndicated to other NPR stations.

He's not saying that he'll submit the share, but rather you discard the block rather than sending it to your pool. By sending to him, he simply verifies that you did indeed find that block, and if his pool happens to find that block, he'll reward with 10BTC.

Or there could be a collusion amongst the top miners to spam the blockchain proportionally, and on average they would recover closer to 75%-80% of their tx fees, while also increasing the baseline tx fees for all other transactions. Could be a win for them, but I don't really have the facts/numbers to back up my claim.

You can actually still use the $5/mo nodes and still have the entire blockchain available.
NFS server with a current snapshot of the blockchain. Each new node would mount the NFS share read-only and then use AuFS to mount a local directory over the NFS share with the blockchain. Of course this leaves the NFS server as a SPoF, but for $40, instead of 2 servers, you can cluster them as 1 NFS server and 4 full nodes.

Even with AuFS?

I'm curious how long the Coinbase support queue is. Seems like almost 2 weeks at this point. Can we as customers get visibility into this? Help us not feel ignored.

It would be 0.4BTC profit, not $400 profit. Could be worth nothing, could be worth $40K.

just watching the bets stream by, gfdsabud seems to be winning pretty consistently with 22X multiplier bets

Extending that line of thought, if a miner believes he cannot operate within the confines of the fees, he quits mining =&gt; network hash rate drops =&gt; difficulty drops. In the end, it boils down to traditional economics / supply &amp; demand.

Also, I use Gyft to purchase a Target gift card which I then use to purchase Hulu and Starbucks gift cards. Now if only I could put gas in my car with Bitcoin I'd be set.

I'd be interested to see it scaled to match the "initial" peak in April and the divergence from there. Thanks for the graph though!
