Phishing site getting login/pwd and 2fa token. Before the token expires, API keys are created to serve the real portfolio balances to the victim, making the fake site seem more credible, while the thief prepares the transfers.
Then something "goes wrong/times out" so that the user has to login again, and the thief then uses the fresh token reply to make the transfers in less than one minute. Can probably be done very quickly with automation scripts or via the API. 
Your 2FA isn't really hacked, you're just fooled to reveal it.

That's a possibility indeed, could work for long term storage. But it wouldn't be as practical as having a hardware wallet in case there are a few transactions occasionally. It would also make it less likely to have the keys snatched while doing one of those transfers.
Totally agree that hardware wallets are not essential if you're careful, but I don't feel like passing to paper just to store for a month or so while the Trezor T is shipped.

Just because the currency would be at parity it doesn't necessarily mean that you'd lose competitiveness. Labor and energy would still be cheaper, for example (taking less BTCs to build the same product in China vs US).

Not too worried. The fundamentals are good, IMO. I like the tech and even the leadership (mostly). It's still one of the oldest stable crypto bluechips like BTC.

@_date: 2018-01-18 14:31:53
Careful when you're encrypting it. You definitely not want to have your seed snatched while using a compromised device to do it. Ideally you should only have it in the hardware wallet and some offline form like paper. That's good enough for most people and can be combined with a passphrase (that works as an additional seed word) that can be memorized, not stored anywhere.

Coinbase Pro transfers take less than 1 minute with SEPA instant transfers, but that depends on coutry/banks. In some in europe you click the transfer and will receive the email/credit in &lt;5min. But from certain banks it can take 2 days.
So it doesn't depend on CBP (they support fast transfers) but on the bank you're using.
edit: Plus recommend dollar cost averaging in batches (weekly, monthly), vs a single big lump sum - for that, even 2 day delays are fine.

It's always a good time but instead of trying to time a "good" single entry point (you'll fail) it's better to divide the amount you want to spend in multiple buys (once a week or once a month, for example).
You'll average your cost and reduce the odds of getting all the capital stuck right before a drop.
Of course periods of all-time-lows and all-time-highs might justify a different move, but we're not in any of the two.

My theory is that Schiff has been secretly filling his bags with BTC, while at the same time trying to slow it down while he rebalances his portfolio from Gold. He's a smart guy, I doubt he will remain 100% invested in Gold now that there is a better alternative. Might be going in a mix of BTC+Gold.

First time watching one of these presentations. At least 1/3 of the tech details wooshed right by my noob ass, but I was pleasantly surprised with the emphasis on increasing Testing/QA coverage, the integration testing etc (tho more testing needed at many levels, especially earlier unit testing)
Very important at this stage, especially in consensus code. 
Quality first, that's something you don't see mentioned enough in similar development projects. It was mentioned multiple times by John and even in the questions.... 
Top notch software QA is an area I'm passionate about and I think it's a very good sign it was mentioned so often. BTC is a project that deserves/requires top-notch software QA and it's kinda cool the contributors seem well aware of that, required even as it affects my hard earned acorns.
On the other side, also nice the news about separation between the GUI and the wallet/node code. Let's face it, Core is fugly. It could be a lot prettier and more engaging, which is not vital for BTC in general but having a nice UI on top of it would make it more pleasant for global acceptance, more welcoming to all types of new users, more engaging. Pretty on the outside, top quality on the inside, done.
**TL;DR: Couldn't understand half of it but they're coding it in the "handle it like it's an airplane" QA/ISTQB/CMMI5 spirit, and as a bonus the GUI might look less shitty one day. 
John didn't bother picking up the pen he dropped - that's a very bad sign, QA-wise.**

Good points, I think a lot of $ currently in all sorts of alts (not to mention totally useless ICOs) will either leave the market completely (people so disgusted with crypto they don't want to hear about it for years) or will slowly flow back into BTC, the leading "brand" that might inspire more trust.    
I'm considering it myself, it's fun playing with alts, but the more experience you get, the more it feels pointless long-term and maximizing BTC becomes more tempting.

Well asking that here is like going to a vegan subreddit and asking if the carnivore diet is indeed healthy.    
In any case, BCH has way too many shenanigans and shady characters involved in it for me. Overall it's a non-question, there's one Bitcoin, BTC and a ton of altcoins/shitcoins.

Interesting but slightly outdated. Both Bitmain and Jihan have now gotten pretty rekt by their Bcash bet. In fact BcashABC+BcashSV (a fork from a fork) are now worth less than the original Bcash.
It's pretty much a pair of dead coins, but their demise is being artificially slowed down by their creators (holding a ton of it and slowly dumping it).
So in summary, those days of Jihan Wu/Bitmain having a saying in the industry are gone. He's not even the CEO anymore after that fiasco and also failing the IPO.
All Bcash flavors will be lucky if they survive until the end of 2019.

You can scale pretty much infinitely on 2nd layer solutions. Divide as much as you want. Waiting long enough I suppose mistakes and accidents could lead to 0 BTC left (all keys lost somehow and no new minting) but that is so ahead in time that by then BTC would long have evolved into something else. Possible? Yes. Probable? Nope.

Yup. Always use a strong/long passphrase, boys. And store it nowhere except in your brain. Losing an exploitable device (or even one with the PIN+seed glued to its back) won't be an issue then (assuming you won't get keylogged inputting it some dirty computer that the attacker also monitors).    
    
Biggest risk will be forgetting it yourself, leading to total loss, so be careful with that "memory" vulnerability and also make sure you use clean PCs for input (unless you have the patience to type 40+ characters in Trezor T's touchscreen every time).

The BTC is not and is lost unless Coinbase refunds you, which they are probably not forced to do (or might not be able to do if illiquid).

Yeah, some people still think you can have a medium of exchange that hasn't even been established as a store of value yet. And that scaling means just changing a parameter and ignoring everything else (centralization, for example).
Bcash isn't going anywhere for a reason. It's fatally flawed from start and competing with payment methods that already exist and work great. Personally, I'm surprised it's even still not delisted everywhere, now two weeks after it forked off.

No he doesn't. BCH+SV are moribund scams. Both are the only major names who are worth less now than when they were first listed at an exchange. 
Vitalik merely pumped them back then because he hoped weakening BTC would help ETH rise in cap. That has failed by a large margin.
But time will tell. This variety in the market can be healthy. Even scams help natural selection progress. At least he didn't suck up to CSW.

What matters is that the whole pizza never gets bigger than originally. Everyone who got a slice knows their slice will always remain the same % of the whole pizza.
However, you can keep cutting/dividing each slice smaller and smaller and smaller. That doesn't matter since the whole original pizza supply never changes. Since it's numbers and not real pizza slices, those divisions in smaller fractions can go on for as long as people want - enough for the whole world to use if needed.

That would make the 1 BTC (at 10K average) around 37% of your current assets (considering just those two). About one third.
Quite a ballsy investment in crypto according to most "financial advisors". But I think BTC will work out well for you in the long run. I'm 50% in BTC. My gut feeling tells me I should increase that position, but the rational side prevents it (and that won't change).

Very experienced BTC veterans like [LukeDashJr think the BTC  block size should actually be decreased,]( to 300kb or so, not increased. Reduced centralization being one of the advantages.

@_date: 2019-08-26 15:56:57
Well if you look at the chart, it has always recovered, we've had multiple ATHs and drops. Does that mean it will recover every single time from now on? Well no, that's obviously a risk.
Some people are down -47% today, if they bought the exact ATH. But that's not the whole market and does not mean it's a bad investment. It's very hard to find better ones in the 2010-2019 band.
Amazon is down -16.6% from ATH. Apple down -13.6%, Intel down -30.8%, etc. That doesn't mean everyone bought the ATH and current buyers are suckers.
Anyone who bought cost-averaging (a bit every week or every month) is way way above the water by now.
@_date: 2019-08-26 15:39:16
Then why is only the All Time High relevant? I don't see the point of focusing just on that. People who only look at the ATH need to zoom out. There's 10 years of data - [ looks pretty good to me even considering those -47.57% at today's price] (
It's a tiny market. Won't go up with the same stability as mature investments. But it makes no sense to ignore the overall macro trend. For short-term traders, yup, it's a rollercoaster. For a long-term investor (5+ years) it's not a problem.

You can't speed up printing of BTC to fund wars, which is what is typically what states do via fiat currencies. So governments run out of funds much faster unless the people agree to finance the war (.gov they can't steal value just via printing+inflation).
[Energy use]( is not "one of the biggest problems of BTC" at all. It's actually one of its advantages. It's what secures the network and makes it hard money. Show me a coin that is easy to produce, I'll show you a useless shitcoin that won't survive the test of time.

Just the fact that they are forks from BTC doesn't mean they are that similar in [value]( Hashrates and security/protocol are absolute night and day. Using your comparison, they're coal vs gold. IMO, they don't have much in common and the model definitely doesn't apply.

"We don’t plan on stopping hardware iteration any time soon! Mk4, Mk5… If you’re bummed that your awesome Coldcard Mk2 is suddenly looking old—we’ve got early-bird pricing for you. Mark2 is still supported in current firmware releases and we will try to support it with updates as long as practical."   
TBH it sounds as if more versions will keep being produced and there's the risk of poor support for older models. I like innovation but also like the stability that comes with having a product well supported for years (Trezor One is a fairly good example).   
So what's a realistic support life time for a mk2 or even an mk3 bought today?

You can also sign transactions offline with the Trezor (so without sending) and then just move that resulting chunk of text to your own personal node and just run "sendrawtransaction (string)" in the command line. 
That way it will be your node broadcasting it, even if not directly connected to the hardware wallets. It's actually quite easy to do that.

Maker fee at Coinbase Pro is 0.15% (or 0.10% if you trade more than $100K/month in volume).

Hopium regarding "masses flooding in" is exagerated, I agree. I think  corporations/gov will be in it way before the public joins massively - probably retail will only join when somewhat "Forced" by other entities (their banks trying to sell BTC products, etc).   
Ignoring "Flaws" depends on how you look at it. For example, for me the transaction speed and fees are not flaws, merely a trait/feature that has its advantages in the right scenarios (not a problem for a settlement store of value).    
Market manipulation is well known and taken into account. Any market so tiny (and young) would be easy to manipulate. It's not a big surprise. Certainly annoying to traders, but not a big worry in the very long term. BTC as a network remains solid, regardless of current price manipulation. As the market grows (and regulation is added) it will become less volatile and much harder to manipulate.
So chill and just patiently enjoy the ride.

Some exchanges charge for transfers out (CBPro doesn't) so sometimes it makes sense to accumulate more before sending. Also, some people trade occasionally and need some there.
Other than that, mostly no reason to do it unless you don't know enough to store it yourself properly (in that case it might be riskier than leaving it at the Exchange).
So in summary 1) To trade  2) To reduce withdrawal fees  3) To reduce risk if unable to self-store securely

There's a lot of time and reaching consensus wouldn't be difficult with such a threat. I'm more concerned about the economic/game theory aspects that are still not totally clear (to me at least) since it's a totally new type of asset, in uncharted territory and with only 10 years of past data. So far it seems to be working out very well both in tech and game theory, but only time will tell.

@_date: 2019-06-01 20:50:45
I see. It's still the best way tho, even if you have to transfer in advance, since needless fees will eat up some of your capital. The costs you mentioned were quite high, versus paying only 0.15% of the operation (and until early this year it was 0.0% at CBPro, but they recently raised it).
Also it depends on country and Bank. For example in many European countries, transfers use SEPA Instant, so you transfer from your account and it lands at CB almost immediately 24/7 - with a minute or so of lag, like sending an email.
With normal SEPA or in certain country/bank combos it can take a couple of days or even more, tho. In any case, protecting capital is an investor's first priority - and unnecessary fees are low hanging fruit.

Quadriga was a smaller/shittier and less-supervised exchange compared to Coinbase, but in any case your example is perfect.
Still, it doesn't have to be that extreme (hack or full loss due to someone's mistake). There is another aspect, CB can freeze accounts/funds. I've seen it happen throughout the years - a user somehow triggers something in their monitoring systems, the account is frozen and then it takes MONTHS to have it cleared via support.
These users didn't lose their funds, but they were still frozen for quite some time - something not everyone could afford waiting for.

Look into "dollar cost average" and Ugly Old Goat's posts.
You don't need to buy big batches (because it's hard to time peaks and bottoms), just divide your available pot in multiple parts and then buy once a week or something like that.
That has proven to have better returns in the long run than trying to make big trades and then waiting a long time trying to time the next.
Basically, spend as if your'e paying an Internet service or something like that. Fixed amount every week/month.

My advice is not to use all the capital at once (single buy) since it is very difficult to time the perfect price (you might buy too high and have to wait some time if a dip occurs).
1. Split it in batches and do weekly buys to Dollar-Cost-Average your pot.
2. Buy BTC only
3. Store your key securely if you move funds out of the exchange (which you should after a while)

Entering the passphrase on the device only is ideal to avoid keyloggers, sadly, it's also a major pain with the current small keyboards. You're stuck with one of 3 options:
1. Have a long/strong passphrase and type it on the host PC and be vulnerable to loggers.
2. Have a long/strong passphrase and spend your entire afternoon inputting a 50 char passphrase on the device.
3. Have a short/passphrase that takes acceptable time to input in a wallet directly, but ends up easy to brute-force, reducing the advantage of using passphrases.
I suppose the best option would be some sort of bigger HW wallet with a qwerty keyboard (or at least an interface to it via USB cable).

I bought literally 10 seconds before it dumped.  In 500+ trades I've never seen such fast big-ass red candles ever. $2K value gone in seconds.
Couldn't believe my timing since it was indeed just after I made a limit buy. I pressed the mouse button and adjusted my chair, grabbed a coffee cup from the desk, looked back at the monitor and "WHAT DA F - order book was crazy and a huge red candle cleaned up thousands in seconds, that's all it took. 
Most annoying trade i ever made. And shows a single whale can totally beat any TA or planning in such a small market. Big players can move it a lot since it has very little liquidity. This will improve throught the years as it becomes bigger and bigger.
In any case, zero worries about it.  You can either go back to fiat and eat the loss (assuming it will keep dropping and you'll rebuy cheaper later increasing your total BTC) or you can just wait for it to become profitable  (which it will, inevitably, but might have to hold the bag for a while).
Or you can mix both and hedge drop/pump by selling 50% or something.
Overall, chill and keep going. Sometimes timings fail. But BTC can be trusted to deliver in the long term.

I'm not too tribal as competition tends to help in one way or the other and poorer solutions tend to die anyway. However, disagree that BTC is on the verge of complete failure. It's never been that healthy and LN is already proven, just not widely implemented.
As for BCH/SV, at this time it feels quite unnecessary. Even LTC is doing better and will probably become a testnet for MimbleWimble and other innovations that will end up in BTC, maybe at layer 1.
One way or the other, the next 5-10 years might be quite interesting to experience.

I find BTC has very high odds of succeeding and gaining a lot more value than anything else you'll do with those 10K.
That said, you'd be putting nearly 90% of your eggs in a single basket. Assuming a worst case scenario - market dips and you need to wait months until your investment is back to break-even. Would you support that?
90% BTC - 10% fiat seems very risky, even at this stage.
You would do better starting with 20% in BTC or something similar (don't need to get a whole Bitcoin as they're divisible unlike stocks).
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:54:50

Historically 100% of fiat currencies have collapsed, many due to hyperinflation. Others just got replaced with something else, as it happened with European currencies that got replaced by the Euro, eating further into previous fiat savings.  
The USD and EUR will not be different.  It might take a long, long time however, maybe not in our lifetime or the next generation's, but they will either collapse/fail or be replaced by something else, certainly losing value in the process.

Easiest way is getting a Trezor (UI is pretty easy/friendly) then backup the mnemonic words and the passphrase (preferably memorize the passphrase and backup only the words).
The passphrase should be strong, so that even if someone obtains the whole seed words they will not be able to brute-force the passphrase (seed words+passphrase are combined to generate the correct key).
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:39:49

Lightning Network (a second layer solution) can use a thousandth of a satoshi. A satoshi is the smallest unit for bitcoin, but lightning can transact with even smaller units while channels are open. Any other 2nd+ layer tech can do the same if needed.
It doesn't really matter as you can keep using smaller units, even if the base settlement layer remains as it is. Right now those tiny units are just dust, but as value per 1 BTC grows, they will become more relevant.
As for lost keys (=coins that cannot be spent) yes, they reduce the available amount even further. Satoshi himself described that as being some sort of a "donation" to the network, slightly increasing the value of all remaining (spendable) units. It's not really a bit deal since whatever is left can keep increasing in value and being sub-divided as needed.

Plus we've seen that even hardware wallets can be compromised. If anyone had stored a Trezor in a drawer three years ago and had not updated it, the keys could be extracted today with the known exploits.

Try the books "Grokking Bitcoin" and "The Little Bitcoin Book".
They're both very good for beginners.
For videos, as others suggested, Andreas Antonopoulos has a lot of good content, but not always easy to find. His 3-books "The Internet of Money" are also OK, but more of a set of random-ish separate talks extracted from his conferences.
Videos/Articles/Tutorials are great but can be confusing for beginners as they only cover sub-sets and usually lack in terms of structuring the big picture. That's why books like Grokking might be preferable for the first contact.

Whales can definitely manipulate the market on short time scales. Definitely hourly and daily but probably not weekly/monthly, at least not consistently. There's also the big exchanges having incentives to liquidate leveraged bets and weird stuff like the ponzi dumping that Chainalysis wrote about.
One has to consider that it is a really tiny market so it is still pretty easy to move short-term. But oscillator charts show volatility has been decreasing (as well as ROI) as cap goes up and IMO the overall trend is definitely positive.
I'm thinking in 3-10 year terms here. Agree it's not something I'd recommend to someone who is thinking of putting some fiat in it and get it back to fiat in a year or two. For capital you won't need in the short term, it still looks like a good safe bet.
I see it as an investment for those who are not in a hurry and are sure they will not need to sell for years. Many buyers probably won't fit that description, but there's still a lot that do. Whale plays don't really worry the latter much... they're just temporary distractions one doesn't care about when zooming out. You yawn, you wait, you learn while the number goes up... slowly.
@_date: 2019-02-18 09:31:58
I have no doubts it will go to $30K. The timespan is unclear however, and more pump &amp; dump cycles will keep happening for as long as the cap is low. Size and scale will inevitably bring it some stability, but that might be many years away. Maybe even a decade or two.

Depends on how it is implemented. Cloud backups aren't necessarily bad, but it's added risk that has to be considered.
If you strong-encrypt your keys and do it correctly, it's safer to dump the file in cloud storage than have it written in a piece of paper somewhere vulnerable, IMO. Also eliminates noobs losing their keys by lost/corrupt storage devices or accidental deletions. That's if you do it yourself however... if it's Samsung's software handling it under the hood, it's a bit of a black box.
If Samsung implements it correctly it might be quite safe. I wouldn't trust it to hold large accounts that should be in cold storage, but it's probably perfectly safe for use as a daily wallet for small transfers.

I like keeping it simple. Something like using gpg on a linux machine works. In Windows compressing/encrypting the file with AES-256 should be enough. You can do that with 7Zip (open-source,freeware). Keepass should be OK too.
I wouldn't worry much about encrypting a .zip with AES-256 and a long strong password and then kicking it to some cloud storage. Just make sure you use a clean trusted machine (preferable offline and disposable) to do the initial encryption, securely wiping the original file. That's probably the bigger risk.
Also, be careful not to ever decompress/decrypt it on the cloud storage by accident. Even if you delete the file, some providers keep a copy for versioning, which can be "restored/undeleted".
There are many ways to make it more secure, but the more complexity, the more likely to result in user error and lost keys.

How old is the account? I had some issues with them but with more time and volume it started being flawless. I think their KYC/AML/Fraud scripts are a bit more aggressive in more recent accounts and probably in certain countries and other rulesets they don't really release publicly.
I wouldn't worry if everything is legit about your transaction, it will be cleared. Of course that doesn't mean it is any less annoying for the user, but that's a risk of going with a custodial wallet.

Coldcard has be best functionality feature-wise (can be use fully airgapped and has some other tricks the others are missing). Trezor T is probably the best in terms of easy-of-use/usability (touchpad for easy input, etc).
So I'd pick from those two.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:57:17
I wouldn't say it is necessarily bad, it can be useful if you need a trade amount there or have a low enough amount that having it frozen for months (or fullly lost) wouldn't be a big issue.   
So it depends on your risk management. I think CB is one of the safest, but their insurance only covers fiat, not crypto. Ideally you should hold your keys, but that doesn't have to be taken to the extreme. I think it's perfectly fine for newcomers to have it at the exchange for some time until it's a considerable amount.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:10:15
$xxx is nothing for them. I guess you somehow accidentally (probably) triggered one of their automated KYC/AML rules and the thing got on hold to be looked that by a human - which probably takes a lot of time. Things would be in total chaos if CB was a stage where they couldn't release that amount of BTC.

Coinbase is the easiest to start.

@_date: 2019-12-10 14:08:01
Saw no indications regarding this. Coinbase is legit, but shouldn't be trusted 100%, as with any other exchange.
You need to have hot funds sometimes, so not everyone can have 100% in cold storage. But there are some risk mitigation practices of course - one would be working with multiple "trusted" exchanges instead of having too much of your portfolio in a single exchange.   
If holding long-time without any trading, best to go cold of course.

Best wallets are Trezor T (fast CPU and excellent touchscreen input) and Coldcard (more features and fully airgapped, plus with a Secure Element chip (which the Trezor lacks, despite having an open architecture). A combination of both TT+CC is (in my opinion) the best setup (not a Ledger fan due to the mostly closed design). That said, any HW (incl. Ledger) is much better than having none.
Transfers to the wallet and out of it take the same time as any other onchain transfer. The higher fees you pay, the faster it is. 1 cent fees will get the transfer confirmed in &lt;24h, but if you pay a bit more it will be 10 min or even less (I just checked, for a max 1h confirmation today you'd use 1.5 sat/byte, about $0.03).
Keeping $ at the Exchange might not be bad for beginners (and might turn out well even long-term) but it means you're trusting the Exchange not to freeze your funds (due to own decision/mistake or .gov enforcement) and/or be hacked out of them. 
All you have is their promise that you'll get what is yours, but history has shown that sometimes people end up being screwed by exchanges (often due to fraud and/or incompetence). BTC is mostly about being self-sovereign and for that you need to own your private keys.
@_date: 2019-12-29 03:38:08
Have them all. It's good. Along with Trez T. Ledger is meh at this point,doesn't provide any of the advantages the other two do (super easy touch input, offline airgapped PSBT, etc).
Coldcard still totally worth it.

@_date: 2019-12-10 14:18:59
Perhaps, but it's not fully under their control. If BTC cap/value keeps increasing, eventually central banks will have no alternative other than holding some reserves of it - or take considerable risks in terms of lagging behind (vs other nations who do it). This might become a strategic/national security issue, a bit like holding gold reserves (and moving them away if you get invaded) was/is.
We might be 10 or 20 years away from that scenario tho, but considering the BTC progress this past decade, it seems somewhat inevitable (regardless of the fuzzy timings). 
It is very difficult to drive hard money away, especially in a fully distributed system that isn't limited the many ways physical gold is. I think eventually we'lll reach a stage where a nation holding no BTC reserves would be the equivalent of holding no gold reserves today - doesn't sound good for competition and survival.

Much faster on SSDs, much, much faster. If not all space is available on your SSD, put the chainstate on the SSD and the blocks on HDD, it helps. With an old version of Core a user measured the difference after moving chainstate to SSD (and leaving blocks on HD) as 1m20.391s vs 0m22.246s (Open/Shutdown cycle). [Source](
In my machine it made a big difference moving just the chainstate (7gb or so)to a nvme and leaving all the blocks (200gb+) in a the (slow 5400rpm HD). Core loads and synchs 24h of transactions in about 30 seconds while before it would take minutes.

Not instantaneous. Difficulty adjusts every two weeks. There's an equilibrium between difficulty/hashrate/fees. When price goes down some miners turn older equipment off (or all equipment) reducing hash. If it goes up new players will join and some old equipment gets turned back on. Fees are not too high or too cheap, they're at the right equilibrium for whatever the balance is at the moment and are the price to pay for the security.
As for 51% attacks, at this stage [for BTC] they're just theoretical. Can't be done in practice with BTC. The cost would be incredible, probably requiring multiple nation states. And there are more challenges. 
Even if you got 60% of the hashrate it would take 100 minutes to overtake the rest of the network in confirming blocks. Meanwhile, the rest of the network would have caught on to what was happening, and begun invalidating the attacker’s blocks.
Plus it's a mutual assured destruction scenario. BTC's hashrate is enormous. The only players who could conceivably orchestrate such an attack are existing mining pools, or ASIC manufacturers if they were to backdoor their miners. They'd be cannibalizing their income source. States could do it perhaps, if having amassed a lot of ASICs and suddenly unleashed it but there are so many difficulties around it that it seems impossible and most likely pointless as they'd end up playing whack-a-mole.  
Alts/shitcoins are a different story. Several alts have been 51% attacked yes, but they all had low hashrates, making the attacks cheap. Nothing like that is viable with BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:06:28
That's one of the reason why you shouldn't put money in alts. Insecure networks can have advantages (speed, fees, etc) but they come at a price.   
Quantum computing is probably decades away from being a threat and even if ECDSA 256 falls, it can be replaced in BTC with something else that would be resistant.

[Black swan]( events. If something has a low probability of occurring but a very high impact, it will be unwise to go for it. For example, there's only a 1 in 6 chance that you'd lose at russian roulette, but the cost of losing would be too high regardless of the possible prize/benefit of winning.
In the same way, there is a low probability of BTC failing and you losing everything long-term, but if that happens you'll be totally rekt and impacted (possibly) for life.

@_date: 2019-04-08 16:27:56
I disagree. The genie is out of the bottle now. Bitcoin can live without fiat, and you can even transact without being online (settling the transactions to the chain later). I think you are hugely underestimating the layers and layers of bureaucracy (and corruption) that are part of most governments. Good luck implementing something at such a global scale. It will not be the same as fencing a country with limited/filtered internet. There are also technical alternatives regarding the traffic and anonymity and each day there are people working on more and more implementations in that direction. Some "bans" will continue here and there, but so far no country has succeeded with the bans, and several have tried.

A common story. Most people who had a lot of them lost them before the recent ATHs. Some due to mistakes, others due to not having strong hands to hold them through huge valuations. Even current hodlers thing they'll keep them for a long, long time, but once they see 10x-100x gains in their portfolio they will start to wonder if it's time to sell.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:38:24
I don't see how it would work without that energy. It's the cost balance that keeps it safe. PoS and other solutions seem very eco until you realise both value and security are at risk. 
I think Ethereum is interesting for some uses, but see no way it can ever get close to BTC for the store-of-value case with PoS. That and events like the past DAO story don't make me very impatient to dive much deeper in it.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:08:47
Well he is correct about all those, which are slowing down adoption. Still, being an early adopter comes with certain advantages, not only risks and work. One can either make the effort to learn and start early (like anyone learning HTML or any other Internet technology in 1993) or forget about it until it is fully mature and standardized (losing some opportunities by arriving late).
Their choice.

He will never do that. If he had the keys he would have already used them to move the coins. The only thing that moves CSW is greed and narcissism. There is NO WAY he would sit on all that money and bother copy pasting and faking, trying to climb up the crypto food chain. Nah, he's not Satoshi in any way, but he might know who the real Satoshi is or having interacted with him enough to gain that confidence to fake it (especially if he knows the real person is dead - Hal Finney or someone else). Just an opportunistic parasite moving in his own benefit.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:02:50
Even if ECDSA 256 falls, something else can be used in BTC then. Probably requiring forks and obviously consensus, but doesn't mean it would die. Could be a bumpy ride if there is a lot more ossification by then (hardware devices that are tricky to upgrade, etc).
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:03:21
Maybe my imagination is limited but I don't see the advantage in this. You get some fiat, change it to crypto, keep it at an exchange, then use it as fiat, over conventional centralized networks and if lucky, having had a positive change in btc&lt;&gt;fiat ratio.   
Seems like totally pointless overhead. My prediction: This product will have very limited acceptance and will end up being discontinued.
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:56:05
That is not my view at all. At this stage you can't put the genie back in the bottle. I think you're overestimating the government's capacity to organize and underestimating BTC's antifragility.   
The gov can slow down acceptance in multiple ways, perhaps reducing interest in it for years. Still, it would spring back like a weed. It always does. Maybe there's some black swan somewhere, but even something extreme like a protocol flaw could still be fixed with forks, as consensus would go that way for sure.
"Stopping" it globally would require combined technical, financial and social attacks at a massive scale, in many nations. The odds of something like that happening are close to zero at this stage (most can't even reach much simpler agreements on much simpler topics).
I do believe they would have stopped it already if they could. Many entities tried already. Yet, BTC keeps coming back stronger, which shows the decentralization is real.
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:50:42
I don't think there's an option in Core to change that specific folder, at least I couldn't find it. In Windows 10 you can just create a a symbolic link.
For example, if you had it in your harddrive, say drive H:, move the chainstate folder to the SSD (in this example, C:).
Then open an admin command line and use the following: 
**mklink /j "h:\core\chainstate" "c:\fastchainstate"**
When Core opens it will still go for h:\core\chainstate, but in reality it will be reading from c:\fastschainstate
Should be a similar process in other OSes. In my machine it really makes it start and shutdown much faster than when I had everything in HD.
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:48:08
Agree, if considering "crypto" as the market as a whole, and indeed many of those 2017-2018 players joined only for a fast profit.
But in the particular case of BTC, I think it goes beyond that and more people are starting to realize it can be an alternative and a safer way to park some savings. But very early stages, perhaps at the level of the Internet in 1990-1995. A lot of the nonsense has to die off and there's a lot to mature. Your "many years off, if not decades" forecast is probably reasonable. I think the market needs at another 5 years, at least.
Heading in the right direction tho, IMO.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:22:07
Don't think it can be stopped at this stage. It would take a massive economical+political+technological effort, coordinated worldwide at a level that is purely impossible in practice. This can happen in distributed bubbles here and there tho, but globally? Don't think it can be done anymore.
The easiest way for them to interface is to make the fiat&lt;&gt;crypto ramps harder to use, but that only affects you when moving from fiat to crypto or back. Still, KYC/AML provides them with plenty of "excuses" to try to slow down and control as much as possible.

I don't see it that way. I see it as store of value but not with all the properties of a currency. It can also be traded, exchanged and used to buy goods and services but that will start happening on second and third layers, not on the main chain.
It was created to be a currency but those days are long gone.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:36:46
I see from your post history that you're truly against it and by mentioning old myths like the "money laundering" I also see you haven't really put enough time into researching it.   
Been down this road many times the past years and to be candid, at some times it's just a waste of time to try to explain things. Not everyone can be safed. I suppose time will prove which approach was the best.
Time is on BTC's side as far as I can tell. The past looks pretty good (11 years now) so we'll see how it turns out. You might turn out to be correct, but IMO, that is a possible but highly improbable scenario.
Edit: I do agree with the long-term approach tho. Don't think BTC is a "good investment" for any capital that might be needed in the brief term. For anything that can be parked for 3+ years however, well... don't know a better choice at the moment.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:16:49
That's true, many people who are interested now fully dismissed it in 2011-2015. I know I did in 2011, since I have emails discussing it and commenting how I was not convinced.
In our defence, back then there was a lot less information available. the technology was even more immature and the risks were much higher. In 2019, that balanced has shifted and if you really want to learn you have several quality resources, plus the ecosystem is considerably more mature.

It's exactly when there is a "crash" and people/press are saying "it's not worth it anymore" that you should look into it. In that sense, you have good timing.   
No one knows how it will evolve. Is it too late? Who knows. Personally, I think it is indeed too late for it to be life-changing for most people - the Lambo meme and the guy who retired at 25 and lives in his yacht won't happen again (or so I think). But that doesn't mean it is not a good investment and good leverage against problems in the traditional financial systems.
So is it late? Yeah. Too late? Nope.
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:20:44
The only way it is more similar to fiat than gold is indeed if you look at its age. Devalued fiat currencies are fairly recent as well.
The volatility is perfectly normal in a new asset and has been decreasing. Similarly, all-time-lows have increased almost every single year for the past 10 (there are two exceptions), making it an immature long term store of value in the making. You could have bought it at almost any time except the late 2017's ATH and still not being at a loss if compared to fiat.
Traffic isn't fake, all transactions recorded on the blockchain are accurate. Volume is indeed faked internally, in many low-tier exchanges, but that has been proven not to happen in all "legitimate" exchanges that are accepting regulation (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, etc). Exchange corruption shouldn't be confused with the protocol, in the same way that corrupt financial institutions and bank heists don't undermine fiat by itself.
Your best point is that it isn't very necessary for people in the first world, which is true. For many it is a solution for a problem they do not have [yet]. That might change as it becomes easier to use - right now people don't have enough incentive to flock to it, [but a second layer is being built]( at a very decent speed (Lightning Network) and it will disrupt current traditional payment companies.    Finally, I think BTC is unique, so the comparison to all cryptocurrencies isn't always that simple. It was born out of a crysis and it is possible that it will thrive when the next [inevitable] one occurs - although it's tricky to predict its behavior then.
People should remember that this is a very young technology. 10 years, if you exclude previous attempts like Hashcash. Dismissing it just because it's not something that can be used immediately feels unwise, in the same way that conventional banking systems took decades to build. I'm old enough to remember discussions about early protocols that became the base of the Internet. Now things are very clear, but back then (~1990) a lot was undefined and shaky - and yet - it was extremely obvious that it would become mainstream in some form and become be base of a totally new industry.  
And considering that, BTC is moving at a very fast speed, even if it is still far from the goal and a lot of it still requires maturity. It takes some vision and/or foolishness to visualize possible outcomes in the future, but I do think it will be very disruptive in the next decade.
Not this year tho, and probably not next year :)

More interesting about your father-in-law's case. I made some attempts to get mine interested in it, but he's very traditional in the form of investments. Perhaps if I spent some time doing some sort of introduction to the topic, but at this stage it probably doesn't make sense anymore.

Everyone focus on Exchanges/"The Gov" having their data but a lot of people forget that anything you're sending there can/will inevitably leak and be used by hackers and criminals.
And unlike stealing your Facebook or Twitter logins, this is big stuff. They have your ID cards scanned, driver's licences scanned, your face, bank statements, utility bills, personal photo holding a timestamped post-it or whatever - pretty much anything you used to prove ID/address/face.    
This is probably a goldmine for 3 letter agencies, they're gonna put a straw in it and suck it all. But much worse than that, much, much worse is what crooks are going to do to your life with all this data.    
It's a serious problem. I'm not super crazy about adding piles of regulation, but at least the data protection/security really has to be reagulated. If there is KYC, then you have to be sure the supplied data is protected similarly to the tradicional banking industry.
@_date: 2019-04-24 12:12:36
Well these days they wouldn't consider "crypto" an investment, no. I'm not 100% against using leverage for crypto if you have funds tied up in something else, but it really requires a lot of risk management. 
The frequently repeated "don't use money you can't afford to lose" is a very simple and good rule. Although in many cases it's not a matter of losing it, the problem is having to wait to recover it longer than you can afford to wait.

In the past I advised some people (who seemed interested) to just get $10 and play with them, moving it around wallets, etc, basically wasting it in fees just to learn a bit about how it all works - in practice, using it to learn.   
Guess how many took the advice and did that?. Zero. Two of them even bought Trezors, one sold it months later (unused) and the other opened the box, looked at it but didn't even connect it. It's too much work to solve a problem they do not have.  And these people are in countries where there is no tax on crypto, so even the hassle of tax/paperwork wouldn't apply to them, but even that way it was too much work.
Someone in Venezuela would have different incentives to be interested, but in stable economies the only incentives are usually the will to learn something new or greed.

If you go to the investment subs these days and make any comment about BTC these days, you still get the same exact reactions. "It's not an investment", "Gambling", "dropped -50%", etc, etc. And a lot of downvotes.
Start chatting about it with some of the people refuting it and then you realize most don't even really understand the basics and always go over the same topics (muh drugs, laundering, gov can shut it down, tax evasion, why not other coin, etc,etc,etc).
5 years after, still the same. Being in BTC is not just about luck, it takes some effort/work if you want to do it properly (research/learn).

Actually the answer isn't the same in all countries since several (including in Europe) have 0% taxation on both BTC gains and shitcoin gains (traded between each other or converted to fiat like EUR/GBP/USD). For example if you were in PT, you'd have 0% to declare/pay.

The network has survived for 10 years and keeps getting stronger. There's more investment everywhere. I think $100K per coin is a very reasonable forecast. IMO, the odds of that amount being hit are substantially higher than 50%.
Now the timing is where things get tricky. My guess is $100K before 2025. I'm looking at it in a 5+ time.
There are some pending risks and threats, it's not a P=1 bet.
Selling a house and car for an all-in seems... excessively risky, unless he is totally sure he will not need any of that capital/fiat liquidity for quite some time (5 years, for example).   
If my friends ask about bigger investments I usually tell them they should invest only $ that they are sure they will not need for 5 years (for example, fiat that is rotting in low-interest savings accounts and won't be touched even in emergencies).
TL;DR: You friend will probably get rekt.

I don't recommend that, but everyone is different. My impressions with crypto have not been positive in that sense. People new to the field do not have the experience to just ignore the roller-coaster price moves - they get annoyed if there are drops after they buy, and inevitably will blame the one who suggested it.

What do you mean? Anyone can afford BTC, even today. Anyone can buy a few satoshis. A friend of mine just bought 100 EUR of it last week, that's $109 or so, he got  0.011 BTC. A piece of the pie, and at least he knows that no matter what happens, his small piece will always be the same % of the total pie. No one will make the pie bigger. Or run away with the whole pie.
What many people cannot afford - and should not buy even if they can afford - is shitcoins. Because those will tend to zero if you don't jump out in time.
Bitcoin/BTC? Pff. Anyone can afford a bit and at least you know it will always be more valuable if you can wait years. Shitcoins are for speculators in a hurry, which is OK if you want faster profit and are good at gambling. Most people are really bad at gambling.
You cannot diversify with shitcoins. If you want to diversify from BTC, then maybe get some Gold... maybe some real estate, short some stocks, keep some fiat money from your government, etc. 
Shitcoins? That's not diversifying. If  BTC fails, no amount of shitcoinery diversification will save your portfolio. That's like saying you're diversifying from the Internet by buying Amazon. There's no way Amazon would succeed if the Internet failed. Sounds like a nonsense comparison? Now it is, but it wasn't before 1995.
Buying shitcoins now is the same as buying Amazon in 1995 to diversify from the risk of the Internet failing. It makes no sense.

Doesn't matter. This is a marathon, not a quick race. There's no hurry. The network keeps growing and getting stronger. A decade went by and the next will come. It's the Internet in 1992. Only 0.5% of the population was using it, most didn't feel they needed it at all.  
The ones who got in early benefited from that decision. It won't be different with BTC, even if it takes another decade or more.

Also Segwit worked nicely and layer 2 solutions like Lightning seem to be inevitable for fast payments over the regular BTC use as store of value. Anyway, people who get in crypto keep learning and evolving, sometimes one does mistakes in the beginning (looking at my bag of XRP now).

One of the good things I like about BTC. Regardless of what is going on and the rate vs USD, the network/protocol totally doesn't care about hype, FUD, politics or any human opinions. It keeps ticking like the machine it is.
A block keeps being produced every 10 minutes on average, nodes keep validating, transactions keep working as they always did, it's just neutral and stable. Network says "Meh" to everything and just keeps going.
After 10 years that way, it's difficult to imagine the next 10 being much different.

I don't see what's so special about 1. It's just a human mental abstraction. Same as if you buy stocks, you can get 1 share of Google or Berkshire Hathaway but it's still just one tiny fraction of a company. The number doesn't really matter, only the % and the way it protects your savings from inflation. 
Not buying BTC because one cannot afford 1 is unnecessary self-sabotage, and really no different than deciding to buy some shitcoin because you can afford a million of them. A fraction of a lot is still way better than a lot of nothing.

I've noticed this since I got into crypto and it remains true. Mass market media forces the news to the results. They look at the outcome and pick something randomize to explain why it happened. Which is extremely easy - you're guessing a possible cause after the event has occurred - yet they are wrong often and even when they are right, it's of no use to you.
Why? "Buy the rumor, sell the news" remains true - by the time mass media reports it, its too late to be useful to you even if it is accurate (and most times it won't be accurate).
TL;DR: Most of the people writing these articles are not good at analyzing events+predicting the future, otherwise they'd be retired,instead of writing articles with randomish guesses on past events.

BTC has never been through a strong recession. It was not available in 2000 or 2008. The next one will be the first time we have it. In theory, it can be a good hedge to a status quo financial system collapse (along with Gold) but in practice no one really knows. 
The past times the stock market was shaky, BTC dropped along with it, so it's not fully decoupled yet.  In any case, the fact that it cannot be printed beyond the limit is already a big plus over a debt-based system with quantitative easing.

In some countries, yes. Crypto profits are legally taxed at 0%. On some of those, in all cases, in others only if they are not your only and main professional activity (i.e. only professional traders have to pay taxes, others don't, regardless of how much profit they make).

Last time I checked, Germany, Portugal, Malta, Denmark, Singapore, Slovenia, The Cayman Islands, Belarus, Puerto Rico. Certainly many more even in the EU. There might be small rules here and there for those, like the PT example (only 0% for those who are not full-time professional traders with no other source of income). The tendency will be for all tax law to converge, but there are different speeds (and at the moment different taxes even in very mature investment types, depending on EU country)
The "tax evasion" term is meaningless if there is no tax on it. It's not evasion. I think these questions make a lot of sense, but people word them poorly. And usually get rushed "Don't do it! You'll go to jail!" replies from other people who assume everyone lives in the USA.

Probably because he's pretty bearish most of the time. I don't think he's selling anything now (except professional seminars/trainings), but takes tips/donations.

Ten exchanges are proven not to have wash trading. There's a pretty good [study]( out on that. The legit include the biggest ones: Binance (110m volume), Kraken (31m), Bitstamp (31m), Coinbase (27m)
Poloniex (1.4m). No wash trading on these and a few more.   
Shitexchanges that are faking volume will die off with time, it's inevitable. Same with all the shitcoinery they support.

Since 2016. I did some short mining around 2011 but back then didn't take it seriously and then parked the topic for years. Sloppy.

Yeah, that's the original, the real deal. Other chains forked from it throught the years and some kept "Bitcoin" in their names to mooch off all the brand power.
But it's BTC that has the biggest network/hashrate by a huge margin (more secure) and has about 60% of market share.

The crypto winter is painful but it is somewhat nice to see how things are being washed bit by bit. Shitcoins, scammers... slowly being culled. Still a lot of cleanup to be done, tho.

You cannot "replenish" Bitcoin. Once they are destroyed (you can call it that if they keys are lost, since they're not spendable) they are gone for good. The only way you can "replace them" is by buying more if there are some available in the market, but that's not the same as just replenishing them with "computer power".
That lost value ends up diluted between the remaining coins, due to pure supply &amp; demand. Losing one is like a donation to everyone else.
If a Central Bank truck catches fire and burns with piles of fiat bank notes however, they can just reprint them. You cannot reprint with BTC. It's one of its main strengths.

Risk  is highly underestimated by most people regarding their key storage. The more time it passes, the riskier. And sometimes you find yourself YEARS ahead and clueless about that "safe passphrase" that seemed tattooed in your brain a long time ago.
I know I lost a few encrypted volumes (not related to crypto but just with old files) because I haven't checked them in a decade and when I did, I was clueless about the original passphrases, which I probably typed hundreds or thousands of times back then. Time fucks up everything.

They won't ban anything. Until fungibility/privacy are well implemented on-chain, BTC is a goldmine of information for them. Easy to track much better than the USD ever was.
Development work in fungibility/privacy is progressing but not fast enough. US Gov bans and pressures would greatly accelerate this. That's not in the interest of the 3 letter agencies that are now quietly observing in the shadows.
The man is just parroting about the ban but is probably unaware of this or any other technicalities. In fact he's definitely unaware that a ban is impossible at this stage. Genie is out of the bottle for good.

Not sure what everyone is complaining about. 3K&gt;20K you make money buying and 20K&gt;3K you make money shorting. No way to lose. /s

This article sucks. Not because it is negative but because the author seems clueless about several aspects of BTC. One more for the Obituaries tho.

But what about those guys that show up and lightly brush a pencil over that notebook you used /s

Yup. Watched [this]( v=OUltZmKqfmM) yesterday. Missed a few points, but still interesting.

Seen BTC gains over 3 digits and losses that would spook anyone, then back to the previous and repeat.
If you believe in the fundamentals you start feeling a sense of peace in these moments and don't get scared with the dips nor ecstatic with the peaks - you're just waiting.
As with many things in life, it takes time. Chill and enjoy the ride, if you avoid shitcoinery and stick to BTC you can't lose long-term.

He's a smart guy. Bet he's secretly buying BTC while trying to delay the loss of Gold market share. If he isn't, he should.

Of so many BTC valuable people they could have had on the show, they pick Schrem and Pizza guy. 
That alone shows the effort that was put into research.

There has to be a balance. People with "nothing to hide" got screwed many times in history simply because their data was not private and later was accessed by an "evil" entity. I find interesting that you can track transactions and history of coins, but there's also a great risk for the honest citizen who wants to remain free and protected from attacks.
This will eventually be put in place in BTC, but it will take some time.

And are a much bigger, more mature market. BTC is tiny and much easier to move. If I had to guess, I'd say things will happen faster, not slower until it stabilizes in 10 years or so.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:57:06
Not to mention that having transactions on a public ledger that can be seen and analyzed by everyone is a pretty incompetent way of using it for crime.
It's much easier to use fiat for that. USD bank notes, for example. BTC will have privacy features implemented on chain in the future, but right now it doesn't. It's pretty transparent money. Its "use for crime" is an urban myth the media keeps propagating.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:41:26
Many developed countries have 0% tax on it. One example is Portugal. It isn't exactly a power economy but it's 1st world and in the EU.
So you can and should indeed "do it" but should get informed first to be sure it is legal.

It's just a tabloid. Almost everything there is exaggerated and/or inaccurate. Useless except for some occasional laughing.
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:03:40
BTC can weaken some economies/countries that the US would like to see weakened. I wouldn't be so sure they would even try to stop it (which they probably can't anyway at this stage) because it might help them undermine some rivals, while still being able to keep control of the traditional economy.   
Wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was created by a US agency for that exact purpose. Although at this stage the genie is out of the bottle and its future is probably no longer possible to predict/influence completely.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:26:28
Tend to agree with that sequence. I'd add a Trezor at the final position in the chain, being a much simpler, isolated device. And it can also used in combination with a phone.

I like the panel, looks interesting. However my frugal side tells me I better use those 500 to buy Satoshis.

I was around when you had to use the command line to send an email, and let's not talk about attachments. Everything was an absolute pain in the ass to use back then. Some websites were no more than lists of text with links. Amazon was considered a bit of a joke.    
But the potential was obvious. BTC is feeling exactly the same, just with more scammers. Comparing to TCP/IP and the Internet I'd say we're in 1992 and needing another 5-10 years to mature.
Genie is out of the bottle, no way back. But a lot can change.

Any one knows a particularly good Bitcoin news aggregator source focused on Asia? Preferably in English, but if it's good and neutral I'm willing to take the risk to just Google Translate it to engrish.

I don't think this would work at all. Technically you could still use the mining hardware indeed but the game theory wouldn't play it that way. Such an attack on BTC would have a huge impact on the credibility of the whole technology. Bitcoin is the dinosaur but many others would end up extinct too or at best kicked back years in terms of acceptance and trust.
I don't think anyone could come out winning from that short, unless it was someone with no other long financial interests in the industry, which would be very odd.

Fiat always matters even if 1 BTC=1 BTC, merely because it's the entry ramp. And the more fiat you need to use, the less BTC you'll end up with.
