Of course I should have waited, I cashed out some BTC to pay for it instead in February :( Oh well I get it on Friday and I'll hold off on buying lots of VR games until BTC support is in! Great work Valve this is exciting stuff!

A bank account isn't a universally granted thing that has been 'taken away'. Rather, we have adapted to life -with- bank accounts. Or maybe aliens, who knows.

Your SO DONE with bitcoin, you provided your address so people can tip you? I'm sorry your money was stolen but this made me laugh.
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:02:06
But yet, you'll put your BTC addy out there, in case someone wants to send you a bit of this money your so done with.

Why? It's the best monetary system currently available for the job.
Like they say for Tor: If the system is secure enough for drugs and child porn than its secure enough for all of us. Do you believe in Bitcoin? Than you won't try to exclude groups of people from using it.

I pay 2/3 of my hosting/server companies with Bitcoin, as well as most of my domain-name renewals. I buy the Humble Bundle's with Bitcoin when appropriate.
I've recently visited two local business that accept Bitcoin: [Bad Genie]( is a bar/nightclub that uses BitPay and offers a 10% discount for BTC payments, and [Crazy Chef]( a brand-new restaurant in town with great burgers and drinks - the owner accepts BTC directly to his personal Wallet and uses it to pay some of his suppliers.
Hopefully NewEgg hops on board by the time I'm ready to grab a new GPU and I can add that to the list.

I would subscribe to way more channels if Bitcoin was a thing.
