Yes, there IS a difference in quality versus price.
I personally like the Special Pihatt because it's Arabica, blended with Robusta, Catimor, and Excelsa beans as well, so you'll get an eclectic mix of fruity, sharp, buttery, smooth, and chocolatey notes all in one (but caution: it's probably a bit strong for American palettes)! But it all depends on your personal preference -- if you prefer dark and sharp, get Regular or Medium. If you enjoy just smooth and buttery, choose Premium. If you're feeling more adventurous and want all flavors, go for Special. Whatever the choice, you'll definitely be able to distinguish the difference in flavor from other coffee products commonly purchased in US supermarkets.
Also, if you want to brew the coffee Vietnamese-style and enjoy the coffee at its maximum authenticity, I highly recommend [this video]( Short, informative, and highly entertaining!

Cool! Thanks for sharing. I should have reworded the title to say "first INTERNATIONAL coffee producer" as that would've been more accurate, maybe. I'm particularly excited about Pihatt though because it's just SO good. Really digging the company's passion for coffee too, as evident by their products and "About Us" page.
