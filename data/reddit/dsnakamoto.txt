It's bad opsec to encourage people to use a fingerprint in a post on a server that you're warning others may be compromised.
"This server might be compromised.  Use this key on this server to verify."

@_date: 2016-08-18 04:38:38
Posting a fingerprint to use for verification on a server that we're being warned could be compromised is bad opsec, no?  Why is Cobra changing the .org site without making a PR?  What the hell is going on?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:07:55
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:38:29
What percentage of Bitcoin users that visit the site know to do that though?  It's known that major Chinese entities don't do this.  So again, it's very insecure to do this, regardless of the absence of malice in this instance.

I'm pretty sure Core just wants us to verify using a fingerprint posted on the potentially compromised .org website.  That's why Cobra posted it there without doing a pull request, and neither nor anyone from Core had contradicted that yet.  It's also noteworthy Core hasn't pushed out the fingerprint to their Twitter account or any other official channel.  Bad opsec is fine as long as you don't support an alternate client.

Does not want to discuss this?  Seems to me the root of the .org's insecurity is Cobra, not China.
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:36:33
Following the standard operating procedure of opening a pull request would have made it clear whether or not bad info was being pushed.  Also using multiple channels and posting the same on Slack, Twitter, etc would have increased the trust.
This incident underscores that we still have a long way to go.  The good news is there's been no greater incentive for infosec than Bitcoin.

That would not increase the amount of hashrate signaling 109.
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:49:50
That doesn't address my point that it's insecure to push out a fingerprint via a website post that's specifically warning that the site may be compromised.
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:53:39
You should contact Circle support.  It's possible someone opened a second account linked to your banking info.
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:42:24
My original point was pretty clear, as it was sarcastic.  I know Cobra doesn't intend on people using a compromised fingerprint on a compromised server.  That's why he shouldn't have posted a fingerprint in the same post he was warning could be on a compromised server.

It's possible support has dropped, but it's my understanding Knc is the only significant mining entity that's hashing Classic blocks and it stands to reason they haven't dropped from nearly 5% of the network unless a lot of hardware just kicked on.

What percent of the economic majority supports this approach?  What are the risks if Core has less than 50% of the hashrate at activation?
This is extremely likely to cause a network split given everyone's stated position, and flies in the face of what the white paper indicates should determine conflicts over protocol upgrades.

There is a risk but it's pretty easy to mitigate in several ways.  You should use the sites escrow if you're they concerned.  Once the seller funds the transaction you can dispute a theft and have the website then release it to you.

Generally fees display a "sticky" nature.  The desire to get included in the next block trumps the demand to undercut the current median fee.  The prediction of fees isn't easy to dynamically handle, and the variety of approaches across wallet providers is indicative of that.

While I'm pretty frustrated with where things seem to be headed (and feel like those that wish to see on-chain prioritized in the short term aren't being fairly heard), I do feel it is important to acknowledge we still have a much greater say in Bitcoin's direction than we do with central banks.

While admittedly extremely unlikely, it is possible that may have happened.  If so then I imagine Gavin would have kept that to himself even under an insane amount of flack from the community.
