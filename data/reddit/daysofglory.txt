what are you even talking about? I'm just looking for a service where I can purchase 1 BTC today, as this is what coinbase is supposedly good for. Don't be a bitcoin evangelical.

nice affiliate links. If you really want to help people learn about bitcoin and have a resource for noobies, don't try to make money off of them by only saying "trusted exchanges," which are the ones that allow affiliates.
@_date: 2014-11-23 08:21:24
yeah, but all his threads are designed to monetize miners with affiliate links to amazon.

do you trade bitcoin at all? If so, do you automate trades with software or just manually trade them based on what you see in the markets?
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:50:14
centralization is never a good thing for a p2p based system like bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:52:34
what a ~~deal~~ steal
@_date: 2014-10-21 14:37:24
yeah i can confirm their API is down

coinbase and okcoin aren't really comparable, given that okcoin has a 10-20x futures product and coinbase only offers spot trading. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 09:58:46
most traders follow what happens on Okcoin.cn and don't really pay attention to BTCChina.

unfortunately, we don't offer a free trial.

hey, [haasbot]( is one of the best cryptocurrency trading platforms. You can automate trades on 12 different exchanges and use over 50 indicators and 60 candlestick pattern indicators. While you do have to pay for a license, we provide regular updates and excellent customer support. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:27:39
it depends on the time period you expect to get a return on. If you understand TA indicators/have trading experience, it shouldn't take long. Obviously, if you are trading 0.05 btc, then it may take a while. Basic functions of this bot are very useful, such as protecting your coins when there is a sudden drop + many other useful strategies.

mike sold his coins in december, so probably close to the top, like mid to high 400s. He could actually buy back more bitcoins than he sold...

the VPS is good and so is haasbot, although I am a part of Haasonline Software, so I have a bit of a bias. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:49:08
Got a VPS from [SolVPS]( to run the cryptocurrency trading software [Haasbot]( off of. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:52:31
thanks for the clarification on this!
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:00:50
congrats to the winners, but I noticed that ~~coinbase~~ the judges didn't even try [Haasbot]( because the license key that I gave them was never activated, thus was never tested. Its a shame because we had just enabled support to the coinbase exchange right before this. Perhaps you guys should actually go through and test the programs/websites that were submitted?

[Haasonline Software]( produces an awesome cryptocurrency trading platform
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:59:48
[Haasbot]( has awesome trade bots with over 50 [indicators]( and some awesome features such internal arbitrage bots and order bots. [Our wiki]( has everything documented, so come check us out!

that was actually 13k btc in contracts w/ 20x leverage, so more like 750 btc was lost in that.

1 day and 3 day RSI is incredibly overbought. Its probably not a good idea to buy/go long here. I'll probably get downvoted for this, but its generally not a good idea to buy/long the top of a move without much of a correction.
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:10:11
yeah, since the swedish government is an evil omniscient entity /s. 
Common man. Its fringe sentiment like this that is a real turn off for people who may be interested in the technology and commodity surrounding the bitcoin ecosystem. Not every government is evil and its rather annoying that "fringe libertarian ideals" are becoming synonymous with bitcoin. Bitcoin is a technological solution, not a fringe belief system.
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:35:50
then why did you create a title called "china unbans bitcoin" if it wasn't banned? Sure, you may be hungry for traffic, but you'll be better off in the long run by publishing actual legitimate articles.
