You are so dug in its pathetic.
Someone mentioning Bitcoin is mostly speculated instead of actually being used (can I go buy gas with bitcoin? nope) and you get triggered.  Calm down.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:40:12
Because you are arguing with someone who didn't even make that statement.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:11:00
Why am i even on the when I don't have animals?
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:43:00
You know there is a record of every comment you have made right?  Keep being combative.  I'm sure Bitcoin with take over Gold soon, g0ldpunisher (lol)
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:37:55
The onus is not on me to present anything.  You got triggered about someone even mentioning Bitcoin is speculated.

It would mean they are possibly following US tax code.  Not that they are necessarily American.

Good luck.  You are beyond the point of having even a reasonable conversation.  You completely avoid questions and cannot back up your main argument.
If you think you can infinitely trade assets to generate wealth you have never lived in the real world.  Eventually one of your "assets" will be a loser after you trade for another (in your eyes) more valuable asset.  You cannot beat the markets forever.  So now you are just splitting hairs regarding what you think is an asset or not.  Have a good day.

Eventually your investment has to be sold for a consumable though.  Otherwise it is intrinsically worthless (your 401k means nothing if you never cash it out, for instance).  You can argue on the justifiable merits all day, but every persons opinion on what's "worth it" is just that, an opinion.

Retirement income can still be spent on fast depreciating assets.  The only main difference is the time the investment takes to mature (but there is nothing stopping someone from cashing out early and blowing it all on coke).  Your last sentence seems irrelevant.  
How long do you plan on holding bitcoin?  At what point are you no longer HODL but SODL?  It has to happen eventually otherwise your investment is a loss.

You are just purposely confusing language, and yet again changing the entire argument.


What do you consider Bitcoin to Lambo transactions being? 
Bitcoin is a medium for exchange just as much as fiat.  Your opinions on the usefulness/validity are an entirely different argument.  If your position is that you will keep bitcoin until the world runs on it, good for you.  It doesn't change the argument you originally made about bitcoin being spent on depreciating assets being a poor decision.

It wouldn't have sold for X if it could have been sold for Y.

If we stick to the notion that something's value is only what someone pays.  
But those are your words, not mine.  So I'm not going to do somersaults to stretch logic anymore than I have to.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:37:01
You seem to want both sides of the coin to win at the same time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:17:27
No you just don't read well.  I answered your question about $4 Bitcoin.
You paid for a house.  You would not pay more (why would you).  So what you *would* pay for that house is considered its value if you want to keep standing behind your quote.
Use an ounce of logic.

So if I buy a BTC for $9000:
 is it's value $9000? Or some undetermined hypothetical price that I could *possibly* get for it in the future?  Pick one.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:39:38
Well he isn't wrong. *Yet*.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:09:32
Sure that's the golden rule.  Never invest what you can't lose.
But when people run through the cost/benefit analysis of spending $X for X BTC, the actual price is very important.
We only think 3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k is low because 9k is the current cap. That is a selective bias.
Less than a year ago saying 5k was borderline crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:05:53
Settle. Down.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:55:56
I love your levelhead and that is what I also think.
I have followed BTC since the beginning. I never really had a need for being on the Silk Road, so inherently I saw BTC as a novelty and a nifty idea.  I once thought it was cool that you could turn your PC on and make money (through mining) but at the time the electricity costs far outmeasured the gains (still relevant for average dudes).
At this point I look at BTC closing in on 10k and thinking "this has to be to bubble bursting right?"
God damn it. I thought that same thing since 3k.  When will this madness end?  Leveraging into all crypto seems to still be "early". I only hope I'm right.  Fuck it. As our lord savior Drake once said "YOLO".

As long as you aren't losing 30-40% you are coming out ahead, I guess.
