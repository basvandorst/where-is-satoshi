after looking at his channel, someone trying too hard to hurt the world

Congrats and good luck!

[here's the source](

I don't think it needs to be anonymous, I just would like to see a lot of sites take advantage of the I2P network. I2P seems like an underutilized resource.

[for the lazy](

Well to be honest, I haven't cashed out, but I only have ~15 BTC. Where did you sell them?
@_date: 2011-04-24 17:28:25
Is it only illegal to have an online poker site with USD? What if there was one with BTC? It could run on I2P to avoid censorship
@_date: 2011-05-12 05:29:21
Alright, thanks
@_date: 2011-06-18 19:43:08
Where am i supposed to spend bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-06-28 15:37:46
I'm not singling out a Bitcoin exchange as something that should be on I2P. I think all types of websites should be on I2P, and there currently isn't an exchange
@_date: 2011-06-01 06:36:42
No map?
@_date: 2011-04-28 22:50:54
I would if they accepted something decent besides PayPal (e.g. Dwolla)
@_date: 2011-08-15 04:52:40
I have time to work on it here and there, but don't have the time to add a lot of features. I'm a working college student and have larger (sorry to say but) more important projects I'm working on. Also, even though I still trade Bitcoins, I'm not always up to date on the latest exchanges.

I2P shouldn't just be used if you want to browse a website anonymously, like Tor. This is my personal belief, but in an ideal scenario, all the websites we browse will be encrypted and incapable of sniffing
@_date: 2011-05-12 05:18:01
what do the username and password in bitcoin.conf do?
@_date: 2011-08-15 01:40:18
I would have loved to get a lot more functionality with charts on there. Right now I just have a chart linked from bitcoincharts.com but would have preferred to roll my own chart system. Also, I would like to be able to incorporate other data sources besides Tradehill.

the problem with selling (at least at the moment) is that by the time someone buys your item, the bitcoin might be a lot cheaper than what it was when you sold it. you could argue that the dollar has the flexibility to do this, but realistically, you don't see this happening.
@_date: 2011-04-28 17:29:08
Aren't we all
@_date: 2011-04-28 16:09:46
I can be your Bitcoin bank. Just send me all your money and you might get it back.
@_date: 2011-06-03 16:24:05
I can attest to this. It's taken up to 4 days for my money to come into mtgox from dwolla
@_date: 2011-06-27 03:20:24
[This]( might clear up a lot of questions you have
@_date: 2011-06-26 22:12:42
Tor was created primarily for privacy on the current internet, with a darknet as an extra feature. The point of I2P is to create a 'new internet'.
@_date: 2011-04-28 16:27:17
@_date: 2011-05-12 05:03:30
What is my rpc username/password? Is this the one I set on the bitcoin.exe command line or the one i set on the poclbm.exe command line
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:16:52
pump.io seems a lot more promising at this point
@_date: 2013-01-29 06:47:07
The main question would be, who determines the price?
@_date: 2013-10-12 09:01:37
Nowhere near as bad as PayPal.
@_date: 2013-11-13 09:14:37
Apply to public schools then
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:45:18
Why should I trust a for-profit establishment like Simple over a member-owned credit union? I value trust over a fancy interface
