The app is not that advanced, no need to worry. See the top answer. PM me if you want to test it. 
My goal is to remove the addresses that belong to people, and only to search for bitcoins that are lost. In time I should be able to completely filter the addresses.

Unfortunately there is no 100% criteria (that I know of) that can say for sure that the bitcoins are lost. The cutoff value of 3 years with no activity seemed more or less logical too me, especially with the recent price increase. The good news is that the chances of guessing anyones private key are very slim to say the least.
If you are feeling worried you can pm me your public key and I can remove you from the database :).

Thank you for your suggestions, I don't think the situation is that dramatic.  I urge you to test the app :).

Most of the studies made on this subject concluded that around 4 million bitcoins are lost. 
100 years is a long time, so it is possible \(we are still very far away from this\) that by then the computation power will grow sufficiently \(quantum computing?\) to brute force the private keys of lost bitcoins \(but all others as well\).

To my understanding, the word phrases are just used for easier memorization and generation of 64 hexadecimal private key. Of course to combat this theoretical issue the size of private keys would have to be increased, which would probably involve "forking".
Well computation power is increasing  exponentially, but it probably won't for much longer, because of physical limitations\(size\).  But who knows what the future holds...
