Yes. Any calculator.  Take the amount of Bitcoin you have and multiply (use the "x" on the calculator) by the dream price.
So if you have 2 btc and the price is $20k each, you have $40k (2 Bitcoin x $20,000).  
I hope this wasn't a troll. If not, good luck.

And got beat up for it on the earnings call.  The $200k profit was miniscule in terms of margin %...  Investors were disappointed with such low returns...

Delta just means the difference.  Your total portfolio increased by that amount.  In other words, the DELTA (difference) between then and now is shown as a % gain.

Trying to make sense of this.  When they say a buy is executed of 10,000,000 @ $9,553.5, does that mean that they bought $10m worth (fiat value) of coin at a price of $9,553.50, or does it mean that the bought actually 10,000,000 BTC to cover the short?  It must be the former, right.  Otherwise this alone was a short position that represented over half the outstanding coins.  A short that big could not be squeezed, right?

its tempting for the principle, but after an attorney hourly rate- that $5k will get eroded.  I think I need to wait for them to clear the deposit, then transfer it all out.

Update on post:  My pending depost just cleared.  9 calendar days on Coinbase to process.
I love GDAX, but still gonna move once my new account is processed with Gemini.

Also just got mine just now.  Perhaps they cleared a bunch of people!
Watch a price run right now as everyone has their funds!  get in before they do and ride it
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:33:30
will do
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:48:15
Just an update- my Gemini identity has just been verified.  So, with current volume it only took them 2 days to verify.  So far, that is better than Coinbase.

My most recent deposit with coinbase just cleared today. An ACH, took 13 calendar days...
I opened a Gemini account today (in process).  I am done with CB.

too bad.  Would have been cool if they dumped everyone's fund to them at the same moment.  Curious to watch the market reaction to something like that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:08:10
Did yours just clear?  Mine did at about noon EST.  If they all clear at once, watch for market response.  100,000 new accounts just get funded and everyone eager to get into the game.

I suspect it wouldn't even work.  There will be a discrepancy in your CB account and the linked bank account in terms of name, etc.  Also, could the person use the details of the bank account as some form of verification of identity with CB to get them to say change your password, unlock account, etc?  Those details in theory would only be known to the CB account holder...,

Looks very convenient, but the fees are crazy!! No way to game the credit card reward points with 11% fees (maybe they are not cumulative, the story wasn't clear, but even 6% is crazy)

Old story arguing he is too fat to be IMF chief

I think it's a good point, but it will take some time to get there.  The reason why is that the banks still holds notes on almost everything.  From your home mortgage to the lines of credit your employer took out to fund expansion or finance a building-all those loans need to be paid in Fiat.  Until Chase bank allows you to make your mortgage payment in BTC- they will having staying power as the Fiat will still be necessary.
BTC is far to volatile to lend on it today.  Would you borrow 10 BTC with a note payable of 2 years from now?  If you did anything but hodl with that 10btc- I predict you would have a hard time paying that back (considering future value).

Maybe one of those visors with the green opaque bill.  I love it!

I'm sure it can be done on the cheap if you were willing to take a bit of risk.  Think about the bodega on the rough part of town.  The one with the glass between you and the cashier.  Who is coming in there looking for  some type of permit or credentials.  On the other hand, in this social economic environment, bank accounts are less common and finding alternative means (on a cash basis- i.e. BTC ATM) to conduct online transactions would be appealing.  There is also the "get rich quick" pipe dream too that would drive utilization.  To prove that point, in this hypothetical store, after tobacco- lottery sales are probably the next leader in revenue.  BTC if again in the midst of a bull run could capture that "lottery ticket" spirit.

Thanks. I was curious as well. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:16:45
So what does it take to buy one of these and place it somewhere?  Total investment cost? Do you buy or lease the machines?  Any capital float on the transactions to provide the liquidity (need to hold the coin in advance to sale- as in inventory cost)?  Seems like it should be easy enough to grab one or two of these set them up in the right location and go from there.  Scale up if it makes you decent btc.
Anyone have any info?
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:27:16
I agree with this.  Alternatively just open that file in Excel, spin up a quick pivot table to get your total net impact, then just key that as if it were a statement from your brokerage.  You really only need the net conclusion in the prep software, not the 13k line item transactions

Shouldn't you be asking for someone to send you BTC, not PayPal? Given the sub you are in....
