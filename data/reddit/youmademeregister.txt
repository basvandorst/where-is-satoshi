Damn, way to rephrase it while still maintaining the same meaning. You must be super smart.

No shit, Sherlock.  But the difference is that it is much more stable despite losing value over time.
What's the point in earning 0.1 Bitcoin for your wages, if the purchasing power of 0.1 Bitcoin is not going to be even close to where it was by the next time you get paid.  And if you make wages dynamic to purchasing power, what do you make it relative to?  The USD/BTC ratio?  A more stable currency?
And no, you can't just move the entire infrastructure of a country's economy.  I think many have already highlighted why you need a physical currency even in today's day and age.

Sorry, how is Bitcoin "financial independence"?  The price is manipulated and the ROI is pretty shit unless there's hype.  That's the problem, there's a huge amount of risk because the hype is dying

So, tell me again, how Bitcoin cannot be controlled by a large, private institution.

You know, judging the reactions of everyone here, I'd say I'm in the right place.  I mean, thats how a gauge Bitcoin anyway, I just keep an eye on the hivemind here

You're right, now that you mention, it, I really have a hankering to buy myself a slave.  Financial freedom, right?

Yeah, I was trying to avoid getting on a list

I guess that means that you can't sign a transaction and then pile those transactions for a minute before sending out to the rest of the network. I don't know shit about the technical details
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:04:28
So why not make the nodes batch transactions?

Just saying guys, there's no conspiracy. People love that feeling of "I told you so" and cum twice every time Bitcoin drops.
