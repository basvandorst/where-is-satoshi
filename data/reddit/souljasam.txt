Ive been doing several faucets that have some 1 click offers for about a week and a half to 2 weeks and I have 0.0008 BTC so far. not a whole lot, but its a fair amount considering i didn't do much to get it.

My guess is that he's assuming the hype around bitcoin will be less in a week and as such the fees will be lower due to fewer transactions.

But without net neutrality ISPs could just block any connections to the blockchain that go through them stopping mainstream adoption. I agree the gov shouldn't have control but neither should the ISPs.

Except government regulation isnt stopoing more companies from coming in. Comcast and all the other bug ISPs are. Where I live there are a bunch of towns that are trying to get fiber and cant because comcast/charter threaten to pull the money they give the local gov or make the companies go through all sorts of red tape with shit lawsuits. What we need is regulation that states there must be at least 2 providers of a particular type of internet service available to any household to force competition.
