Same thing happened to me. I only have a few dollars worth of coin there so I just gave up. Not worth my time.

Why not? I have been watching this stream since the game started.

dice.ninja is a dice game that came out recently that is adding some new flair to dicing. It is provably fair and has a nice UI.

I used to use Bitmit and although it wasn't great it worked. Recently I had some stuff I was looking to sell and spent a couple days looking for bitcoin auctions sites and I found a few but most of them had almost no auctions. The only one I found that seemed to have any people on it was cryptothrift. 
Cryptothrift isn't as good as Bitmit but they seem to be working on it. I have had to submit a few support tickets and they have responded within a few hours which was nice. I ended up selling 3 items on cryptothrift and was paid in bitcoin. I would have been better off selling the items on ebay and then buying bitcoin. They ended up going for about half of what they would have sold for on Ebay. They really need more people buying and selling for the site to really thrive. 
I just assumed that the people that created Bitmit got tired of the work and wanted to quit. it sucks but that is life.

I am on board. Is there a p2pool I can point my miners at?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:42:48
Be careful mining with your laptop. They do not have adequate cooling and you can damage your laptop if you let temps get to high. That being said the more people mining the better, and it is a lot of fun watching your computer crank out some bitcoin.

If you got it today it would mine 2 bitcoins a day, but you will not get it today. By the time the miner ships the difficulty will increase and you will be making less than 2 bitcoins a day. It is hard to say what the difficulty will be when these ship. So it is impossible to know how many bitcoin you will get everyday. My guess is that it will never meet ROI. 
Personally I would not order anything from butterfly labs. They have a horrible history of being way behind their projections for shipping.

How do I move it?

What you say is true, but it is the only way this guy is going to be able to make a profit mining unless he has an ASIC or free electricity.

His Phone has CyanogenMod installed but it has not been rooted. Mycelium was installed from google play. It had recently been updated to kit kat from google with OTA.

I will but it wont be till tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:26:40
The boot loader from CyanogenMod was installed but he updated his phone a couple days ago to 4.4 so his phone is not rooted.

I didn't think I was going to watch the whole thing but I did. Thanks for showing me an interesting panel discussion.

If you are mining with a GPU point it to  it will mine the most profitable alt coin and then exchange it into Bitcoin for you automatically. It is a lot more profitable then just mining Bitcoin. Good Luck

Neither one of us are new to bitcoin, but we are new to android. We have been mining for about a year. The chance of a collision is so low it is practically impossible.
It is possible that he has some malware but the phone is not rooted and mycelium was downloaded from the play store. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:52:27
That would explain it. he must have clicked on the wrong receive address. Thanks

Not a Brain Wallet random key generated in Mycelium.

Same here.

That isn't a bad idea. I will start working on this when I meet up with him this evening. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:19:02
So more of a pain than just editing.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:45:06
If you do an over the air update doesn't it break your root? and he never installed a new rom once he installed CyanogenMod. We have only had our new android phones for about a week so I am not an expert on this.

If you look closely it is a guy in black on a skate board holding a bitcoin sign.

I bought some 3d printer filament from protoparadigm in bitcoin and I sold a reprap I built for bitcoin. I find the entire experience worthwhile. I figure if we don't use it as a currency it will never move past the speculators.

For some reason I cant get it to strike all of the text but I added bold text to the top.

It was a new address generated minutes before we did the transfer. If you look at Blockchain.info you can see it only had one input and one output.

If you would have asked this last week I would have told you to do a pre-order for a Neptune from KNC miner, but only if you are not adverse to risk because who knows when you are pre-ordering asics.    
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:46:59
Phone was not rooted and never was Cyanogenmod was installed as a bootloader on a stock Rom from google. It is possible that it has malware on it. I am trying to figure out what happened so it doesn't happen again. 
I added a link to the Bitcointalk thread.
@_date: 2013-09-30 23:16:19
I would recommend that you just buy bitcoins. If you are asking these questions then you probably don't have the know how to mine and make a profit. The only chance you have of making a profit is if you can get a new generation asic the day they come out, but this would require you to pre-order your miner. So far asic manufacturers have been less then stellar in getting orders out when they say they are. You are taking a gamble when you pay for a pre-order and most people that have done it have been screwed.  
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:59:28
Did anyone pay with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:47:03
Not running a custom rom it was updated a couple days ago over the air from google. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:08:02
His phone was updated to 4.4 from Google the Cyanogenmod was installed before that and it did not have root access. 
The Bitcoin was definitely taken from his phone / address.  
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:52:47
It was not a brain wallet. It was randomly generated on the phone in the mycelium wallet. 
edit: this was supposed to be a response to user exchanges_suck
