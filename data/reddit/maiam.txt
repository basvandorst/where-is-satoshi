i think you're saying what you want to believe. When this story does fall apart (which we can both agree that it will), no one in the journalism world is going to care. All that self-satisfying, self promotional crap is exactly what gets views. You're valuing the concept of journalism way to high in 2014. Sure, they're still some great, honest journalists but they are few and far between.  
When it comes down to it, she's going to have an article under her belt that go a million + views and thats all the media sites care about. These sites are so desperate for views that journalism has sunk to the crap she wrote.

The problem with all of this, is it's a win-win for leah. She could probably give a rats ass what we all think. Her article, shitty as it was, has received all the vanity metrics Newsweek could have hoped for. She'll, unfortunately, be writing for a while.

I don't believe any of this and newsweek blows. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 00:43:46
This whole situation blows my grandpas mind. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:31:09
Holy shit. I read that whole article and did not realize she wrote it. All credibility is out the window now 
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:29:45
and somehow got all of that in an article the size of 2-3 tweets.

been around since 2013 and yeah all this feels the same. I will say there is a lot more negativity than I remember in 2014-2015 but I guess theres just more money that was 'lost' this time around. I think it'll be relatively quiet till our next halving event in 2020

so i have coins on CB...i should transfer them to a blockchain.info wallet? and then what exchange do you for trading? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:46:25
if i have coins in coinbase, how will BIP148 and SegWit affect me? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:13:11
Anyone have any good resources on setting up a lightning node? 
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:50:59
very very dumb question but im dumb so: Does this have any implication that he somehow would be granted 'rights' to the BTC protocol?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:54:18
So where should i get a wallet to transfer my crypto that i have on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:12:53
no worries!

When you set the deposit amount bitfloor emails your the deposit slip right? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:09:19
When youve sent USD to bitfloor, will they convert it to BTC immediately? What I want is to bring my USD to BTC-e, but that doesnt seem possible 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:42:46
Are you able to the BTC from coin base over to BTC-e and mtgox?
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:37:31
many of these are sarcastically hilarious
