I know nothing of bitcoin, just am subbed for research purposes and to gain more knowledge.


In a world where bitcoin was the only currency, 21,000,000 (it's just me, coming from games where the highest numerical possible was roughly 2.1b I kinda feel like 21m is randomly set ... but like my opening there) so taking into account theoretically there are only 21m bitcoins, then taking into account satoshi for 1btc you got 100,000,000 satoshi? 
so we got 1/100m for .000,000,001 this inadvertantly makes it to where would could lower the cost for the entire world by what I've read on this sub as "money for the peasants" and bartering within the range of first ,001 or up to 1-100 satoshi for general goods/etc
this only changes the termonology we would be using, there wouldnt be millionaires anymore, 
say I set up a mining rig that could mine .000,050,000 satoshi let's even just say per /day ? then  one month we are at .0015 now , seven months being .0105 , ten years at .1825..... now exaggerated math, let's say as we make money we add on to the mining power, eventually coming to a point where I'm not spending any of the bitcoins but only saving them..? then once all 21m coins are in my wallet? no i rule the world or what ?
, or did the realization of that, bring about the alternate cryptocurrencies for data sinks so one person shouldn't be capable of mining all 21m coins..
in essence I like the movie "In Time" I think was the name? where time was money. essentially was the same shiz, but in comparison its bits, the world will grow around whatever form of currency is best for its efficiency, first we had rocks, then shiny rocks, so on so forth
