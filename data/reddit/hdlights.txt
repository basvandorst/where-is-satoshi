**This is not fine.** It's only fine if you can live the current day and never worry about the coming future. One critical bug is no longer an issue, but unspecified number of new bugs can be introduced even tomorrow. What will you do then, having so imperfect patch policy for this network?
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:24:55
Agree, but how about that:

This is cool. Just remember [to upgrade your node regularly](

You're right, it has nothing to do with vaccins, except being more or less accurate metaphor. Please don't take it as a propaganda. It has no hidden agenda. I only want to promote keeping the network in a healthy state and raising awareness.

Thanks but I'd like more detailed and more technical answers, considering whole ecosystem. How can current bitcoin network compare to anti-DDoS solutions companies such as CloudFlare or Akamai offers? What do you have in mind when telling "higly distributed". Do you count all full nodes or the subset of listening nodes (public IP) or the subset of so called "economic majority". How do you think the network can handle modern attacks of throughput measured in Tbps? What types of DDoS attacks are possible and what are not (e.g. amplified/reflected)?
How do you generally estimate the resistance to DDoS attacks in this perspective?
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:30:50
Thanks for the answer, but obviously I'm not talking about attacking a single node but the infrastructure. Since long time modern DDoS attacks can be focused on a single target (e.g. Microsoft), but to execute an attack, they need to target the infrastructure of hundreds or thousands of servers.
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:14:00
In opinions of many, nodes don't really matter. Only economic majority nodes are important. Do you agree with it?
@_date: 2019-01-03 08:27:33
This is great [santoterracomputing]( Just remember to [care about your node and patch it when necessary](
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:36:51
I agree that all existing bitcoin nodes are important. That's my point when I'm asking [here]( or [there]( why majority of clients are not patched and nobody seem to care about implementing better ways to encourage node owners to make responsible and faster updates when required.

I'm already providing help for Bitcoin in many ways I can. That's not a crime if I ask at the same time what core developers has changed to improve the security, is it? I consider it as a help too, in terms of raising the awareness of the community.
I'd rather you focus on the two ideas I've wrote above, but anyway, thanks for the thread link.
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:57:51
Thanks for the comprehensive answer!

You're right. I gave more specifics in [the comment above](
Let me know if it's enough to start the discussion.
Regarding the DDoS term, I use common sense meaning. In this context it will be paralyzing the network transactions in any severely inconvenient way, e.g. trying to take down crucial nodes managed by so called "economic majority" causing to stop operation of some Exchanges. It may also be cancelling of the large number of nodes run either at home or at cheap cloud hosting, causing them to stop relying transactions in a scale, which will be noticed by the network (will be considered a threat to whole network).
It's an open question. I am not aiming for any particular goal here. I'm trying to get the best technical answer I can regarding current state of art for Bitcoin resistance to this class of  attacks. If it's decentralized and therefore immune, how well it's decentralized? Are there any weak links that can be attacked using DDoS more easily than the rest? It it's immune, how do you estimate the immunity in numbers, considering modern DDoS attacks throughput, number of endpoints to be attacked and other factors? I do not define what will be the disruption for bitcoin network and agree it's a matter of interpretation. Same way as with critical bugs. Was the inflation bug disruptive for the network? Could it be in some scenarios? Just please help me to discover this.
@_date: 2019-01-03 08:21:29
They're a minority. The problem is somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:55:24
The Inflation bug from Sep 17, 2018.

Yes it's perfectly safe to run on an SSD. And congrats for your decision to run own Bitcoin node.
