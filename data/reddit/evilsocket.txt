I have been using cryptopay for months to store small quantities of BTC and use their debit card, I never had a single issue.

yeah but i've been looking at that graph for quite a few weeks now and I never saw a spike like that ... thanks anyway, you have a point :D
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:04:25
oh so I'm not the only one wondering about it ... THANK YOU :D
@_date: 2016-06-03 10:56:54
sounds good :)
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:14:44
Exactly what I meant! My english is not perfect, thanks! :)
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:14:18
thanks, but I have to admit I don't usually follow this "optimism" around bitcoin ... yeah, now it's going up, but this also means it could go down of at least the same amount if not much more :D

Hey, you and your developer can use the same setup i'm using 
@_date: 2016-05-08 16:32:04
thanks, I'll surely keep that in mind, but right now I'm quite confident I can easily make it on my own :)
@_date: 2016-05-08 16:23:25
thanks for sharing you're experience, it definitely motivated me even more! :)
@_date: 2016-05-08 15:39:22
thanks for sharing your experience! i'm waiting for other opinions as well :)
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:17:38
so the timing of these things is not "weird" for you at all?
@_date: 2016-05-08 16:44:33
I'm also "documenting" this on my blog  :)

If you happen to have a spare raspberry pi or Apache+PHP+MySQL -&gt; 
@_date: 2016-05-08 17:50:05
I know, but as you've mentioned you can't literally live only on btc
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:24:30
i don't think that's really safe, they produce the coins, they know the private key before you do ... it just looks stupid IMO
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:15:23
ahaha thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:16:56
because they usually verify things much better than that
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:28:05
yeah, of course the "core" principle is quite known, but (at least as far as I'm concerned) this is the first time they do this openly
@_date: 2016-05-08 15:58:39
I'm not interested in "bitcoin to bank payments", I'm trying to achieve the same exact opposite in order to remove banks from my life.
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:28:59
i meant all this anti privacy laws and someone trying to steal someone else's identity so openly
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:56:07
ahaha no, I'm absolutely the opposite XD i just found it weird, that's all :)
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:04:21
Any support for Trezor?
@_date: 2016-05-30 11:32:31
i don't see it happening
