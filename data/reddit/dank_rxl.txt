For what my team is running, were gonna need 3 power supplies per pc.
 , should have the cables you need... currently down. 
Look at these pics and vids, do you think they degrade performance?
Good site right here..

May I ask, with a yubikey. Your account cant be accessed without one? or You can't make transactions without it?

You should also note, every card slot on your mobo can run a card in it, so you have 5 slots? 5 cards... wanna see how? 
See those cables? there's ribbon adapters your can buy.. link here.

butterflylabs.com, $600, 832m/hash, comes with a program to run it.

it is more profittable for each card to be running on its own, do not crossfire them.

What I wanna know is, Who's got the MINI RIG?
@_date: 2012-02-23 21:43:03
I dont think so.. if all keeps up, bitcoins can be mined until 2043. me and some buddies started mining less then a month ago. so were just getting started... if everything fails, your out of 750 bucks. oh well, you only live once to either get rich or be out of a measly 750. Just do your research and make sure the rig is properly set up.. we have 4 machines, and just figured out that we can have 7 vid cards on each machine.. still learning new stuff everyday! Cheers and happy mining!
