Alright. Tell me then. How do you run an online e-commerce website, accepting cryptocurrency with your BTC wallet without reusing address. Clueless beats you with your statement.
Just to add on another scenario. Tell me too. If you are an owner of a chain of restaurants or fashion stores. How do you accept cryptocurrency with your wallet? Give your cashier staff access to your cold wallet?
Services exist for a reason. It might not be the right requirement for you at your current level, however it might be of value to you one day. So instead of calling someone clueless or dishonest, why not give it some thoughts

You know what? BTCPay should have been very honored to have such a committed believer like yours truly. But i think you are a shame to BTCPay community on the way you conduct yourself, debating their solution against others. I still will continue to respect Nicolas and their work on BTCPay, because whatever you said today DO NOT represent them or their months of work and ideal. You should be truly ashamed of yourself for saying what was said. The ecosystem does not need such narrow thinking.
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:38:33
I think i did not explained it clearly. Let me try again, apologies. This time include some technical details.
Whenever a transaction occurs between merchant and their customer, it is first validated on the blockchain itself. AtomicPay does not come in the middle of this. The transaction is confirmed and completed on the blockchain between 2 parties, in this case a merchant and a customer.
**How AtomicPay Works?**
We use the **Public Key** of merchant to derive an infinite number of wallet addresses and each time an invoice is created, we randomly assign unused address to the invoice. The next step is to listen to assigned address for TX confirmation and to update the merchant on it's status
AtomicPay **does not require Private Keys**, hence there is no possibilities for us to process any outgoing transactions. Money, funds, payments ONLY go direct to merchant cold wallet. That makes it secured.
On merchant's customer end, we **DO NOT** require name, address, email or any personal details during the checkout process. Hence we do not store any of the sensitive data which fulfill the part where we say Customer Data Privacy.
It has nothing to do with running a node or not running a node on merchant end. There is nothing that can be modified once the transaction is confirmed between 2 parties on the blockchain. A node helps support the chain, but in our case - it doesn't meet any requirements for merchants to maintain a node.
Of course. If some merchants are seriously happy to invest in a node, we would be happy to release a node listener and have them installed along with the coin node.
The issue is that when a merchant invest in their own nodes, they would need to consider the fact that a node can't support all of the coins we support now and in future. Also server does go down once in awhile, and in the event of downtime, how would the merchant handles things differently?
If a merchant only wish to accept BTC as a single option for their customers, and has basic technical knowledge - i would recommend open source solution. The masses are different from the minority. Most wanted safe, secured and easy to use platforms
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:40:25
Super cool!!!
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:45:08
Creating load-balanced mining nodes is important to support the chain network, in fact having more of these nodes help a blockchain in decentralizing power. Our transaction fees are post-paid, similar to how SaaS charges a client. Fees are not deducted from the transaction and there are no possibilities of us doing so when funds are directly sent to merchant wallet. Honestly, we don't think there is any false statements made in marketing.
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:42:07


@_date: 2018-12-20 13:33:39
You can sit and debate the word game, wouldn't really want to waste time on it. Just one more. You quoted an abstract that's say A to B without going through a financial institution. Firstly we are not a financial institution. Secondly, transaction funds from A to B does not go through AtomicPay from start to end. I would not be surprised at all, if you did not read our documentation. 
Any way, agreed on the Privacy which is something everyone should enjoy. It's a choice if anyone would sacrifice a part of it for convenience. No one is forcing anyone on privacy.

You can't say blockonomics provide you a bad answer just because the refunds are not possible with non custodial solution. I don't mind you being unusually harsh against our project but seriously learn to respect other projects. Blockonomics was the first few to build a idea around non-custodial.
Instead of barking on others, why not build something that suits your requirement on your own. Be nice to others.

@_date: 2018-12-20 14:42:08
Hi Sa2shi. AtomicPay backend is supported by our own full nodes. It does not reply on third party API for validation of TX due to high possibilities of man-in-the-middle attacks. For verification of transaction, you do not need "big name" API to verify anything. Anyone can verify a transaction with a cold wallet or a full node. In fact, these third party API is something that should never be consider when building a payment gateway. Reliance on them is dangerous.
On a side note, we already offer our own set of REST api and there are already many developers building some great ideas upon it. [
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:20:07
Hi thanks for the comment. 2nd time in 2 days. Appreciated. As much as we would like to be open and upfront, we only have approx 50 users for our closed trial over 2 months period. We were testing everything we could with our closed group of merchants before we decided that it is now the time to release our private beta version.
This is the reason why we started marketing for the past 2 days. So until 14th Dec 2018, i can't predict how many users will be onboard for our private beta. However, the first public release is scheduled for Q1 2019.
Hope that helps in answering you. =)

Thank for the comment. Yes you can integrate it into vending machine if it is programmable and has a basic screen display. The idea of RESTful API interface is to allow any programming language to connect over standard HTTP protocol
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:18:29
Oh.. That's bad in USA. But merchants can get a more reliable services like DigitalOcean starting at just $5/ month. I think it should average out to approx $35 for a mid range server that can host a medium size e-commerce sites. I will write a more detailed documentation comparing hosting to help merchants. Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:55:06
Thanks for your time too. No hard feeling, it is a great conversation. Cheers
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:17:10
Ok i understand your question now. Server security is part of our due dilligence. Sensitive information are encrypted which is the most basic of running such a service. AtomicPay generates an infinite amount of wallet addresses from single public key of merchant. Exposing a used address is not of security concern as all these addresses are exposed to blockchain explorers.
You mean billing invoices? Merchant receive the invoices automatically on our AtomicPay application. An email will be sent to simply inform merchants of a new update on billing activities. No other information is exposed in the email except for the BILL ID, Merchant name and the email. Of course, to view the bill invoice - merchants must login to their AtomicPay account.
Our email  has 2 parts. For private email conversation is on GSuite. For marketing and notification, it is done via Sendgrid
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:08:38
Ok i really get your point this time. =) Let's talk about BTC only. :P
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:23:49


The payment is sent to an address derived from the HD tree of merchant cold wallet, so funds are sent to the merchant
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:35:05
I get your point completely. =) From a merchant point of view, we would need more altcoin options. Depending on how things move forward, we would try to support the top 10 coins or coins that have real value in cross-border payments.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:42:38
Please don't make me start on what's exactly a financial institution. Google would be good if you care to use, because they took away your privacy.
Let's not argue on this. We are committed to pushing adoption and I believe so is you. Might be on a different path, but still similar goal. You will always have a choice, and so has others.
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:37:14
Yes agreed. Different merchants have different requirements at different stages of their business.  It might not be something you would need now, that's sure. Nice conversation. =)
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:59:37
Thanks. =)
We do not expect users to run nodes, as our approach towards payments meant to keep things simple for merchants while being non-custodial. As it is in beta mode, a lot of marketing materials are not released to the public. The nodes that are used to monitor transactions are active mining full nodes, it's kinda of making value out of existing mining nodes. The future plan include but not limited to partnering with existing mining pools and releasing a client-side read-only wallet which acts as a wallet as well as a listening node.

Merchant can choose to use Personal plan if they do not want to KYC. There are regulations in every country of business registration. These are hard facts that maybe you will never understand. Narrow minded? You choose to read what you like to interpret. There are other line of words prior to that sentence.
As long as we can partner with more mining pools, we will be able to use their existing nodes to decentralize the storage of data. These are things you don't ask before jumping into conclusion.
Simple question: How can you guarantee that the server which you hosted BTCPay will not be hacked or the data evver be in GOV/3rd party? Oh i forgot users of BTCPay host it on cheap hosting service provider like under $5/month? So tell me more about these shared servers, how safe are they?
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:16:34
Let's end this endless debate. You can do what you like but not the majority of merchants who will invest in hardwares and maintenance. All the best

@_date: 2018-12-03 02:05:47
Yes I saw and I explained in details to each one of the comment what I think of BTCPay and how it differs from AtomicPay. BTW we are also a watch only wallet. So, what is your point?
So at the end of the day, you will still need to run a electrum merchant feature with a server, receive the payment, update your inventory and OS commerce database. Else you will need to use OS like BTCPay which is a great processor. Not that simple as you think from the start when you called someone clueless and dishonest?
So what are you arguing right from the start?
You said as if you can accomplish all these by simply using a wallet? So many bits and parcels that still needed to pull together. Guess you must be a huge enterprise with hundreds of staff - hence doing things with a snap of fingers, else you got to be a small merchant, not understanding what is going on here.
Arguing for the sake of argument is not constructive, mate. If you have something else that can make a point, yes I am willing to debate constructively.

BTCPay is a great project, BitPay has a nice UI, Blockonomics has a great idea behind monitoring, etc. Does it mean everyone is forking just because design looks similar?
On one note, the original design UI seem to start off from BitPay, based on our research on checkout UI =)

@_date: 2018-12-02 22:46:31
I believe you are already using existing payment services. One way is to set it to a higher expiration time like 60 mins? The expiration is to ensure accountability and privacy. We only allow an unused address to be monitored for a set period of time. However, it may be something we can work on too
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:09:06
Not as if govt can't issue regulatory orders for your server provider to hand over data if you engage in illicit activities. It is not an argument until you get it on storj. Love to speak to people that only read whitepapers, it shows how ignorant one can be
Btw Storj is data storage. Put a BTCPay on it? At least not for foreseeable future.

So tell me in your best idea how will big e-commerce companies accept bitcoin? Manually generating address and matching them to each invoice? So you want to talk about intermediaries?  Even if they would to create and host their own payment solution, they are still effectively on a cloud server handled by a hosting company or hardware rented from IBM. Still intermediaries, isn't it? Care to give it some thoughts before a debate?

Please read it as a sentence. I specifically said from a business POV. I believed my statement is not wrongly interpreted. I said and quote myself " when things are not automated and address is reused for each transaction"
What I am implying is merchant who does not have an automated system in place, usually accept payment by printing a QR code and pasting it in the shop. How many times have we seen things this way? I am sure you know the problem
We can't take things out of context. Normal consumers like me and you are different from a merchant accepting cryptocurrencies. They have taxes to pay, accounting to be done, etc. Having an automated service helps them accept cryptocurrency easily and in term drive the adoption of cryptocurrencies in day to day transactions.
Also, you can't expect an online retailer to keep manually copying and pasting addresses when customers make purchases via their website. Don't you agree?
What harm does it do?

@_date: 2018-12-02 22:22:11
For us to deduct % directly from transaction, we would need the money to first go to AtomicPay, hold the funds before it reaches merchant wallet. **However**, **this is not the case for AtomicPay.** Money **goes direct** to merchant wallet. LN integration will be completed by early Q1 2019
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:53:03
Like I always said, BTCPay is good. Never ever said anything bad about them. I know you are very supportive of BTCPay and so is bitcoinshirt. But please respect other projects, and widen views. We are here for adoption in cryptocurrencies, so are every other projects working in this space.
BTCPay is still effectively being hosted on third party servers, every piece of information will still have to pass through somewhere and be on some storage. Encrypted or not isn't the argument. A bad actor only need to target the host server. It is still effectively relying on intermediaries. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:09:47
Thanks for the comment. In summary. Every newly created invoice is assigned a random node ID from a pool of existing nodes. The monitoring service is proxied. The assigned node will be used to only listen to the derived coin wallet address. Upon matching the transaction in mempool, it will fire a request via the proxy to update the invoice.
As for "dynamic" term, we run incremental snapshot - 1 shot for each coin node. In the event where demand for the service exceed our server capabilities, a new node will be churned with the snapshot and sync to full node as a backup support to AtomicPay service.
Even though it is in beta at the moment, we brainstorm a good chunk of possible scenario before working on the prototype. Hope that helps explain slightly better

For many reasons, especially from a business POV. Accepting cryptocurrency payments with a wallet is a nightmare, when things are not automated and address is reused for each transaction. AtomicPay automates all of the process and most importantly generates a new payment address for each of the invoices. You can read more about our features at

KYC is not a requirement for AtomicPay usage. It's optional and it's for regulations in our country of registration. On a second note, "a software as a service" has nothing to do with the vision of Bitcoin. It's exactly this type of narrow thinking that slows down the adoption of cryptocurrencies.
You really believe that the merchants on the ground would sit down and listen to your vision? It's always a demand and supply. If there are increase in acceptance, that would be more adoption.

Agreed with you on the first 2 points. Point  yeah it has to be accomplished with the help of a lot other factors, such as govt supporting the use of cryptocurrencies. However, we are doing as best we could on what we do best which is development to try our luck at pushing adoption. Still better than not doing anything, waiting for it to magically happen. Agreed?
Skim or processing fees, it still come down to one thing - there are bills to be paid for every services, from hosting nodes to developments. If it is a good service that serves the end user well, i guess it will be a fair deal to pay.

Hi. Thanks for the comment. AtomicPay does not process outgoing transactions in our nodes. We do not hold private keys of users. Nodes are dynamic load-balanced servers that only listen for incoming transactions. Transactions only happen on the blockchain between 2 parties, in this case - the merchant and their customer. So yes, it is decentralized
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:57:09
Yes. Host it on either a cloud server or hardware like raspberry. Great. You can truly be independent the day you can host it independent of any third party. I am happy that you are implementing BTC payment solution for merchants, at least it is similar goal towards adoption.

There are trade-offs for non-custodial solution. One being the issue of refund and crypto to fiat. Latter we are finishing up the crypto to fiat via local exchanges of merchant choice. As for refund, it can only be completed manually, at least for now.
Not every small merchant has coding knowledge. Like wise big enterprise does not mean they will invest in their own payment system. There is a reason why Grab and Uber uses the same third party payment processor. Don't they have enough resources to do such a thing?
Like I said, there is a reason for services. We provide an additional choice for merchants. It is their decision whether to do it manually, integrate things on their own automatically or use a third party service.

Had a long debate with another BTCPay supporter few days back. Not gonna repeat much of the debate once more. A few points to clear up. We do not hold the funds of merchant, we do not require details of merchant's customers, KYC is not a requirement and it is P2P. One good point about being a business, we make things easy for merchants. We provide speedy support. We build faster and we are responsible for what we built.
Just to add on. We don't go around calling other coins shitcoins, publicly and privately. We integrate coins that is best for merchants, and never refuse developments that will be beneficial for merchants.

Nope. We do not receive the payments. The payments go directly to the merchant wallet, we do not deduct any % from the transaction. We only require public key to derive unused addresses for merchant cold wallet.

Thanks for the comment. The nature of open source means developers and the community can choose to build at their own pace. Most OS developers have their day time job, which does not allow them to commit fully into am OS project.
Crypto to Fiat is definitely possible for open source, provided they have a team dedicated to make withdrawals in Fiat possible for merchants

I totally understand. If you have been reading the thread, it has been a wonderful day answering all comments. =) Cheers
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:27:34
Sure. We have a roadmap of coins that we would start to integrate. ZCash is one of those on our list.

Hi Danny, you make a real good point here. That was the topic of discussion few days back. In business, there must always be winners for all sides. We were discussing with shopping malls on having their retailers adopt cryptocurrency and the first question was "What do they gain in return"? Hard fact in life though. So we are brainstorming on a new model where all three parties - the merchant, their customer and AtomicPay stand to gain from the adoption. However 6 - 12 months 0% is quite extreme. Lots of bills to pay, but we should come up with a new model pretty soon.

It's Christmas coming. Enjoy your holidays. It's great speaking. =)

Thanks for your comment. It is built for merchants, with non-custodial &amp; other important payment processing features which are different from a normal A to B transaction. There are a lot of details involving how it works technically and non-technically in this thread. You might want to take some time to have a read on it to understand better, prior to a comment. Thank you

By Christmas hopefully

Serious, you can't read for goodness sake or what? Under Personal Plan, KYC is not required and there is no limit except for the number of API calls which at a more than generous limit of 30 per sec. On which part of our website or marketing materials say KYC is a requirement. Amazing...
Obviously you have issues with understanding basic paragraphs. If AtomicPay isn't P2P, i guess BTCPay isn't P2P too.

I saw it 2 weeks ago. I can't comment on it. They are a group of good people doing their best for the community. Our approaches are different, but end goals are similar
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:39:21
BTCPay is a great project. Having more coin support doesn't hurt but i get your point. =) Lightning network will be supported by early Q1 2019

Thank you for your kind comment. We are still working on BTC lightning support which should be up by Q1 2019. =)

KYC is not a requirement for AtomicPay usage. It's optional and it's for regulations in our country of registration. On a second note, "a software as a service" has nothing to do with the vision of Bitcoin. It's exactly this type of narrow thinking that slows down the adoption of cryptocurrencies.
You really believe that the merchants on the ground would sit down and listen to your vision? It's always a demand and supply. If there are increase in acceptance, that would be more adoption.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:04:28
Haha nice
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:58:23
There are a few points that you were inaccurate
1) We are not a third party between transactions
2) Payment processors are exactly what we need now to speed up adoption of cryptocurrencies in daily life. Obviously it must be better than the current market offering.
3) Skim is rather harsh. We offer it as a service and we do not deduct fees from transactions. The service is post paid SaaS service.

Our payment plans are post-paid, which means merchants only pay once every end of the month. There will be a billing invoice issued on each end month. Here is an image link of how the billing looks: 
You can read in details on our pricing model at 
Our fees start at 1% flat rate. Merchants can upgrade to Business plan (0.9%) by complying with our KYC requirements. In addition, we provide incremental discount rate to as low as 0.8% when you achieve certain level in monthly transaction volume. 
As a business, it is our responsibilities to monitor for illicit activities, that include stolen funds, etc. Handing of data will have to be based on the nature of event which i am not legally trained on this matter.
The design of blockchain has changed tremendously since day 1. Today, we can mix BTC with 3rd party before sending it out. Coins like Dash has PrivateSend feature. And so on... Tracing a transaction would be a difficult tasks.
As for your other question: How do you secure merchants privacy?
Can you elaborate on it? Not quite understand where you are coming from.
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:35:34
TBH, BTCPay is a great open source project. Kuddos to the community. AtomicPay has other features like PayURL where you can request payments via messaging platforms. We are also finishing up on crypto to fiat via merchant's local exchanges of their choice. As per i mentioned earlier, our approach is to make things simpler for merchant without requiring them to run nodes in order to keep their funds safe and secured. Future plans may allow merchants to download our official wallet that acts as a listening nodes

Comparison wise, we start at 1% flat fee against PayPal 2.5 - 5% fee per transaction. Traditional payment gateway has more than just one fee. For PayPal, they have fee per transaction and withdrawl fee. Visa has their standard credit fee, bank charges, etc.

I think we should move the GMP dependency to our servers. We will explore this issue and try to rid GMP from merchant end. Thanks once again
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:48:48
BTCPay is great idea, but that does not make them the only payment solution. Appreciated your comment. Thanks
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:05:45
There are markets for each type of solution. Why should we build another system like BTCPay. Like I said it is great and there is already a BTCPay. Each of us have different market of users. Is that really hard for you to accept hard facts? Maybe you should really take some time, sit down and cool down your own ego. No business is a conflict of another. Everyone of us build something for a reason and it's your choice to use which of it.
