Well, i'm currently studying law, and it suits me, i'm doing pretty well and actually think i'd be a decent lawyer. Assuming that happens, I will have a salary. I won't be homeless. This is money my mum wanted to give me when I get a job etc, presumably to put towards a house? She just thought well, shit, why not invest in bitcoin it seems to be going pretty strong, and since there's this pot of money i thought i might aswell dip into it and see what happens.
In all honesty, it won't be a big thing for me. I just didn't want to buy a load of bitcoin and then have a hard fork and them lose their value. 
what i'll do is i'll invest it slowly, as people have suggested. And i'll keep reading this sub, hopefully i'll learn as I go.

Thank you for this. I'll bear that in mind. I probably might invest a bit, but as you and others have said, slowly, and if it's going to shit i'll just cut my losses. 
I'm also going to start looking into this whole bitcoin forking thing. I have literally no idea what it means. something about the code, but again, I only know basic HTML from an incomplete codeacademy thing so yeah.

You would be correct, I do not understand investing or risk. I am 22, I have never invested anything, nor have I ever had anything to invest. Thing is, i'm not attached to this money. I didn't even know I had it until a couple hours ago. And I don't even have it or control it, so yeah, it's not like I'm too attached to it. Obviously I don't want to lose it all, but a little loss isn't too much. 
I figured if I bought now, while it's at 750 quid or so a bitcoin, I could wait for a year and it might be at 1,500 a bitcoin. And i've doubled my money instead of making 1% in an ISA. That's why I figured I could buy bitcoin, and it's not like i'm putting everything I have in there. If the only thing is I lose a bit of money on my investment, that's a risk i'm willing to take. 
Also, why should I divide it? As you can tell, I don't know shit. Is the price of a coin likely to keep dropping for a long time and I'll be missing out? 
Maybe this is my mum's way of getting me to learn about investment and risk. She was a derivatives trader at a big UK bank, high level shit. She could probably figure the bitcoin market out in two seconds. She must be using this as an opportunity to teach me about stuff.

oh i know it wouldn't help me at all, just said that to prove precisely how little I know. Good to know i don't need to read code, but as it is i don't understand technical things. I could probably get my head round it, I'll read and hopefully learn as I go on.

the amount of gold used in coins was decreased periodically. It would still be worth a shilling or whatever denomination you choose, but the amount of gold in that coin was less.

there's a UK law firm called Selaachi, first firm to get an injunction on bitcoin in similar situations to you. they're based in london though so might not be of any help.

did that. I wanted to make a quick buck off the last dip (not the one 2 days ago). Sold at £1200. It went up to over £2000. i'm an idiot. I am now going to hodl.

gambling has bad moral conotations? i'm in the UK, it doesn't have that here. it's standard. ladbrokes (gambling shop) are everywhere.

I'm wanting to get into bitcoin, my Mum kept telling me to call hargeaves landsdowne about buying a bitcoin derivative. the timing is weird, there's no way she knew about this. I'm not interested in this bullshit. I'm just going to buy bitcoin.

Put out fear uncertainty and despair (I think I got the abbreviation right) to make the price crash. Then buy loads and wait for the price to rise again. I can't help but feel that a competition law authority would probably prosecute for abuse of a dominant position if you could prove intent.
