Hey there - We sent a reply to you, perhaps it got stuck in your spam folder - in any case - your order has shipped.

Basically, in the simplest way to think about it - the computer is just holding the private key to your funds. No bitcoins are ever stored on a computer - they exist at an address on the internet in the blockchain. So long as you have the key - it doesn't matter where your backups are stored you can retrieve the bitcoins and spend from the address by importing the private key into a new wallet. 
If you're worried about your laptop dying, why not use a BIP38 encrypted wallet and generate your own passphrase and keys (something specific to them of course) and hold them physically. We offer a service that does this, complete with an extensive FAQ and video tutorial at  
Paper wallets are great but we produce high density laser etched aluminium Crypto Cards that are waterproof, flame and scratch resistant and will last for over 70 years if taken care of properly. 
Check us out - we make it simple - and once you have your card all you have to do is scan the qr code and send the funds to take your bitcoins offline! Also if you use the coupon code 'reddit' you can save 10% off :) oh and we ship globally - anyways hope that explains it

@_date: 2014-02-16 20:25:08
In order to include spend functionality, you effectively need to be carrying around a card with your unencrypted private key to scan. This lowers the security dramatically, as anyone who gets your card - or photographs your card - has access to ALL funds in your wallet. 
As these are used as a point of cold storage, the best way to get functionality like a visa prepaid is to use a company like Coinkite - or simply install a Bitcoin wallet on your phone.

Hey there, I want to chime in here, because we have a company and product called Crypto Cards - we create laser etched BIP38 Encypted cards in color dyed high density aluminium. They offer the same functionality, waterproof and flame resistance up to 600 degrees c.
The primary difference however is that we don't generate your keys for you - we let you encrypt your own keys with a secure passphrase and then etch them for you. This allows us to be a trustless system. We couldn't spend your funds even if we wanted to. Best of all, we're cheaper and have a superior design - check us out at  - and get an offline wallet you control!
Also, check out our cool video :) 
We've got an in-depth FAQ and fancy diagrams explaining exactly how everything works - and we won't outsource your etch to a third party because we use all of our own equipment. Finally, we don't cash out to fiat - we keep the bitcoin commerce flowing by paying all our material suppliers in BTC itself! Hope that helps, and using the code 'reddit' at checkout will save you 10% :)
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:46:42
Maybe I'm being naive - but think of how magical it would be if they never were - if Satoshi has 8% that means he has $ 1,187,760,000 but yet he holds... So who knows... Maybe he's already wealthy and could care less about spending them...
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:13:11
Well check if our supplier carries it and get back you! Cheers!
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:20:48
Not a scam at all friend :) users can download an offline wallet generator, create a BIP encrypted private key that they obscure with a custom robust password - and have the information laser etched. There are even public only cards that offer the functionality of carrying without a public key that can take funds from any wallet and place them directly offline in cold storage. We support Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin currently and are expanding as demand requires :)
While were on the topics of scams, we couldn't spend funds put on these cards even if we wanted to - they are encrypted with BIP38 encryoted keys. We don't take any non encrypted addresses for this very reason. We work this way to protect the client, as well as ourselves.

It's advertised as 'fireproof up to 600c' and by all means use a match or torch lighter for an hour on the card and it won't falter (as we have stress tested it), in fact you can rub the soot off of it with ease. We're not advocating that you should count on the card to survive an inferno, just that it has more flame resistance than paper or plastic.

Great - good to know it! I'm not gonna harp on and on, you seem like you got it sorted. Good on you - most people have no cold storage, no backups and no clue. 
Maybe also include a note on the instructions you've made for your wallets (if the private key is unencrypted) - "Do not share a photo of this qr code anywhere."
Not sure if it was real, but I recall someone on reddit finding an offline wallet of their sons and posting it online asking what to do - and boom, funds gone. You can be prepared, but also you run the risk that the person who goes to use the offline wallet might not be prepared.
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:40:40

@_date: 2014-10-27 19:01:02
Fair enough, and I understand, since this user has been repeatedly indicated, can we ban him please?
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:40:06
Banks are centralized and offer reimbursement, cryptocurrency does not. Also, consider that large transactions are flagged by banks and verified. If you're storing 1000BTC do you really want to be carrying around a card that can be photographed and emptied instantaneously by anyone who catches a glimpse of it with a qr scanner?
This is why are cards our BIP protected, alternatively you can load the offline wallet into your phone and use it to send btc, but then its not offline.
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:36:04

Just wanted to chime in here and elaborate that you shouldn't use wallets with keys generated by third parties. Step up and learn how to generate your own keys and then encrypt them for best results. If anyone is new here's how offline/paper wallets work in a nutshell.
Basically, in the simplest way to think about it - the computer is just holding the private key to your funds. No bitcoins are ever stored on a computer or paper wallet - they exist at an address on the internet in the blockchain. So long as you have the private key - you hold the ability to spend them. It doesn't matter where your backups are stored you can retrieve the bitcoins and spend from the address by importing the private key into a new wallet. 
Using a BIP38 encrypted wallet and generating your own passphrase and keys and holding them physically gives you a lot of security. In the future - if you're interested, we offer a service that does this, complete with an extensive FAQ and video tutorial at  
Paper wallets are great but we produce high density laser etched aluminium Crypto Cards that are waterproof, flame and scratch resistant and will last for over 70 years if taken care of properly.

Hey there, sorry to hear that, it is 300DPI etched and should scan with any phone no problem! There is no greyish printing on those cards, you're actually seeing the metal inside the card once it's been etched, and sometimes they can get the dust from the etch itself on the lines as the laser's create the card.  
What you can try is this: Take your card and clean it under running water with a green and yellow kitchen sponge and dish soap. Give it a little scrub nothing too crazy and then rinse it off and dry. Then try scanning! Let me know! - Levi

I know there will be a massive influx of new hardware and computer based wallet systems like the trezor that boast features, but for my money I'm using the offline methodology primarily. 
Without being spammy, and because we believe in the product we wanted to give a shout out to Crypto Cards. Keep it simple is ideal, and offline wallets are great in that regard, but most look like crap and just cant hold up.
We've found a balance between something that feels tangible and sleek in your hand - and also has a cool factor that makes it feel connected when you scan it at an ATM for example. Or you can load it as a viewing account into something like mycelium using the public key and check your balance daily without ever taking it online.
Additional security is at the forefront as all cards are BIP38 Encrypted and no one but you holds the passphrase for decryption. We think they offer a great value and we wouldn't be producing and using the product if we didn't believe in them. Have a look at cryptocards.co or check out this video!
Multiple currency types are available and everyone should have a secure offline wallet so in times like this - you can feel safe.
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:50:43
Hey there! Basically, in the simplest way to think about it - the computer is just holding the private key to your funds. No bitcoins are ever stored on a computer - they exist at an address on the internet in the blockchain. So long as you have the key - it doesn't matter where your backups are stored you can retrieve the bitcoins and spend from the address by importing the private key into a new wallet. 
Using a BIP38 encrypted wallet and generating your own passphrase and keys and hold them physically gives you a lot of security. In the future - if youre interested, we offer a service that does this, complete with an extensive FAQ and video tutorial at  
Paper wallets are great but we produce high density laser etched aluminium Crypto Cards that are waterproof, flame and scratch resistant and will last for over 70 years if taken care of properly. 
Check us out - we make it simple - and once you have your card all you have to do is scan the qr code and send the funds to take your bitcoins offline! Also if you use the coupon code 'reddit' you can save 10% off :) oh and we ship globally - anyways hope that explains it

We only accept BIP38 encrypted keys and so all private keys submitted are passphrase protected. We couldn't spend the funds even if we wanted to - it's a trustless system. :)
@_date: 2014-06-22 23:32:32
Well, BIP38 Encrypted passphrase protection (assuming you have a strong pass phrase) is extremely robust. So robust that if your passphrase entropy is high, it takes decades if not centuries to brute force. This makes it virtually a moot point to brute force. But really, the protocol strength is directly dependant on the user, we use CryptoCards too for our cold storage and feel completely safe doing so. 
Side Note: There was a wallet that was posted with a 4 character passphrase and 10BTC inside and it's been un-cracked for months now. 
We recommend protecting yourself from potential brute forces by using a passphrase that is six words long and also uses numerical or ascii characters, we would also advise against common phrases or quotes. You can check out this page for more information on what types of passphrases are strong vs. weak. 
Also, we purge all orders and keys from our server immediately once they ship - this means that we never store your keys or hold on to them, we do this for additional security.
Hope that answers your question!

You're right that it's opportunism, but at the same time we believe in our product as a great solution for these kind of use cases so that's why we chimed in, sorry if it was spammy wasn't intended to be. Many have lost BTC due to bad practises and storage considerations, etc...

Once our orders ship we purge them from the system, so just to clarify - we don't actually keep a record of your keys, and we never ask or store the passphrase. This is to protect both us and the client - even in the event that we are hacked, there's nothing left for hackers to find.  
If for some reason an exploit is found in BIP38 in the future, we would advise those with cards using the technology to upgrade to a new storage type.
The burden of keeping up to date with encryption schema and vulnerabilities falls on those who use the technology. 
My funds are on these cards too - and that's a fair trade off for me to have to keep my eyes peeled for updates with you. Things evolve so fast.

Hey there - good post. If you're interested in something more durable than paper check out  we offer laser etched anodized aluminium offline wallets. They are scratch, water and flame resistant and rated for over 75 years. Create a BIP38 encrypted key with strong entropy and a strong passphrase (we have a section dedicated to what makes a good password) and then we'll etch em and ship em out!
Also, in light of the new NY regulation attempt we're featuring a revolution card you can check out.
Also you can save 10% off with the code 'reddit'
Hope that helps!
Edit: some people will say don't trust a 3rd party even if your key is encrypted. To those we say, generate a STRONG passphrase and you are safe. We purge all user key information once the order ships as well. Were not in it to do the KYC rigmarole, we LOVE trustless service and user obscurity.
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:15:36
Not at all, users can only submit BIP38 encrypted keys, so we couldn't spend your funds even if we wanted to! It's a trust-less model but remember to create a strong passphrase!

I would highly recommend you look at CryptoCards instead! Our product is made out of a high density aluminium color anodized card. Its 100% waterproof and flame resistant up to 1200f - more to the point, it won't ever rust or corrode and we let you generate your own offline keys so that we couldn't spend your funds even if we wanted to. 
We've tried to create a trustless system and we've written a dedicated FAQ and produced video tutorials to assist those who are new. 
Also, we support 15 currencies and ship globally. If you use the coupon code 'reddit' you'll also save 10% off. And if you're still not sold - you can check it the video and other info below :)
Also, order 3 cards and you can save $10 off the order :) We're trying to make it easy to get solid, secure storage solutions that take under 2 minutes to set up and even less to take online when your ready. The cards Aluminium are rated at 75 years!

They're not ready yet - we're trying to figure out a way to create a card that satisfies everyone, some people want QR codes, some don't need em if they have 10 currencies and want to save space. It's a matter of figuring out what card design we want to roll out. As you can see it's already tough to fit more information on just a single card We may choose to increase the size of the card to something like 5x7 and make it look sleek and satisfy other design aesthetics... So we're just not ready to commit to a design just yet - soon though :)

You nailed it, as COINTALK mentioned below - the BIP38 protocol is extremely robust, but should new protocols for encrypted addresses arrive in the future, we will definitely look at what they have to offer. In the mean time, we feel this is the most secure way to go. 
Technology changes so rapidly that there may also be a need to migrate offline wallets in "outdated" encryption schemes as time goes by, but the beauty of open source Bitcoin improvement protocols is that everyone has access to the latest and greatest rather instantly. 
If a user is concerned about storing an offline wallet or uploading the details (even though it's encrypted), you can still generate an offline wallet and use a Public Key Only card - which offers you the same functionality of having a durable, time resilient card that you can carry around in your pocket to accept payment with! :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:11:37

You're doing the same thing, assigning an image to some guy you think will spend... Only time will tell...
@_date: 2014-06-05 04:30:58
Thanks for the typo! We've fixed it up!
So basically, you can pick however many cards you like. On one hand, having a single BIP38 Encrypted card will give you QR's for both keys. The private key is encrypted and requires the passphrase to access it - meaning that even if spotted or found - the funds are still secure. So it's safe in a wallet from that perspective. Some people even order multiple encrypted cards that use the same keys so they can keep them in multiple locations in case one is destroyed or misplaced. 
Some people feel less secure carrying around a private key even if it is encrypted, and so we also offer Public Only Cards. These you can pop into your wallet no hassle and receive crypto every time you flash it to someone willing to send funds. The funds go directly offline in a safe and secure address (or you can use them with your current wallet - no biggie)  - which is nice. It's about as safe as you can get. :)
So it's up to you really :)

Correct me if I'm wrong but if you owe a bank 10 dollars and the dollar crashes, it's NOT easier to pay it back. You need to work twice as hard to get the 10 dollars as the inflationary cost of living goes up. A dollar crash makes prices go up - which leaves you less able to have left over income..

Bank safety deposit boxes may be frozen or accessed if there is a judgment against your assets. These judgments can come either from private party judgments, such as collections agencies, or the IRS. Since you must supply your name in order to open a safe deposit box, the IRS can trace that box if they have reasonable cause. 
You really wanna hedge your bets that the bank is not gonna pull some crap about "we regulate Bitcoin and we think you have some" - to FINcen, that's an example reasonable cause scenario that would have them open it up. This may or may not ever happen who knows. But keeping it in a bank?! You ever hear the quote: "Never keep anything that threatens the king hidden inside the castle."

Actually, we have no access to the funds. We only take BIP38 encrypted private keys and so without the associated passphrase we are unable to access any funds. It's a trust-less system.
1) the user downloads the offline wallet github generation tool and creates an encrypted key
2) the user sends in the encrypted key to be etched
3) we mail out the card and the order is automatically purged from our system

Just took a look at their website, interesting... Though I'm not surprised that in the Bitcoin space there's a lot of parallel thinking. 
The short answer is that competition is healthy and though we're not affiliated with them in any way - because we own our own laser etching machinery and don't need to outsource - we believe we can provide a better product, at a cheaper cost and faster turnaround, plus no 3rd party etcher receiving your keys. 
More importantly, our service offering will be far more diverse than the competition; we'll be introducing wood, carbon fiber and laminate Crypto Cards soon and plan to offer tamper proof security stickers as an additional option on top of our already encrypted BIP38 private keys. 
We also offer support for multiple currency types, not just Bitcoin.
Additionally, we're an officially registered company in Ontario with a mailing address, on top of this we hold the Canadian federal trademark for the name "Crypto Cards". 
If people are interested, Crypto Cards has decided to post our Canadian Government Registration and Master Business License for operation on our site and you can visit cryptocards.co and visit the transparency section for more info.

Hey there, the code we employ to auto-detect how many cards you have selected and give you an input box for the keys hasn't been implemented for all browsers yet - in the mean time, if you place a note with the additional keys and indicate which colors the 2nd, 3rd and 4th cards should be, we can process this no problem - sorry for the inconvenience - our coder will be fixing this shortly.
EDIT: As a temporary fix, we have included the ability to include up to 4 keys on all orders until we can get the auto-adjust working properly - please put the keys in the order that corresponds with the colour choices on the order.
UPDATE: Our coder has integrated the checkout process and now multiple cards with different keys is a synch!

Cryptocards.co offers offline wallets that are laser etched aluminium but this is how we do local trades so that you can carry a public only card with just the public key, open wallet, scan QR and then receive the funds. No hassle and if there's nothing they can do with just a public address :)

Also, if anyone is interested and unfarmiliar, CryptoCards are laser etched anodized color treated aluminium Bip38 encrypted offline wallets. What a mouthfull... Basically, you can go to the shop and within 5 minutes place an order for a passphrase protected aluminium offline wallet that will stand the test of time and resillience to elemental damage. Because the user generates the keys and their encrypted, we have no access to your funds and it's a trustless system.

Verso Cards offer a similar functionality and a different client offering - check them out at versocards.com :) We are more old school in our approach that nothing beats a truly offline system that is managed by the end user for the best in security and trust-less functionality - and that's what we've done with these.

Storing private keys (whether encrypted or not) in the cloud is like taking a paper wallet and storing it in a bank's safety deposit box. Seems safe, probably is - but your still hosting your wealth inside of a system that you don't control. And in the event that Bitcoin or other crypto currencies go to the moon - they're could be an influx of issues with retrieving your files/wallet/keys. Imagine walking in to a Bank that has outlawed Bitcoin asking to store/retrieve a bitcoin wallet from your deposit box. People will jump all over this saying "It's your property they can't stop you" but if it's outlawed that won't matter. Ex. try storing weed in a safety deposit box sometime and see what I mean. I realize that outlawing Bitcoin is absurd and has a host of repercussions for government and banking but why store your files in a cloud system that could potentially deny you access if you break the new terms of service that change overnight one day. 
Not to mention the risk of the server getting hacked, or search engines spidering the files and making them public (like what happened to dropbox not too long ago), even having the service provider delete the file if pressured by the powers that be to disallow crypto initiatives, (like trying to store a pirated movie on dropbox).
Sure, this stuff may never happen, but you don't want to be hung out to dry in the event that it does. Now for the pitch, We have a product that is element proof called CryptoCards and they're basically offline laser etched cold storage cards. Waterproof, flame resistant and you can keep them in a secure physical location you control as opposed to an online location that you borrow/rent (for lack of a better word). They're also BIP38 encrypted and so it's a trustless client vendor deal - you can see em at  /end pitch
It's ultimately up to you where you want to store your funds. But if you're using cloud storage because you don't have a better alternative just remember that a lot of cold storage solutions that work now may become poor choices as legislation cracks down and so on, having something you physically control is a much better alternative than something you can't physically control... If that makes sense...

@_date: 2014-04-01 17:40:32
What? No you don't we do it this way specifically so there's no trust involved. Perhaps you don't understand. We take your encrypted address and laser etch it. You set it up before even coming to our site, once it is encrypted, you can send it to us to be etched. Without your passphrase for the encrypted key that you yourself generated the funds are untouchable by us.

Speaking of BIP38 Encryption - we offer laser etched aluminium offline wallets called CryptoCards - they're scratch proof - waterproof and flame resistant up to 600c! Check em out at  - we've got a great FAQ and videos explaining it on the site. 
We wanted to create a paper wallet system that was safe and secure and something we can take trust in for our own coins. And we only take BIP keys so the system is trustless!

Get a CryptoCard from  and save the hassle :p 
@_date: 2014-06-05 04:35:30
I just wrote this a second ago in another thread, so I'll paste here:
Basically, you can pick however many cards you like. On one hand, having a single BIP38 Encrypted card will give you QR's for both keys. The private key is encrypted and requires the passphrase to access it - meaning that even if spotted or found - the funds are still secure. So it's safe in a wallet from that perspective. Some people even order multiple encrypted cards that use the same keys so they can keep them in multiple locations in case one is destroyed or misplaced.
Some people feel less secure carrying around a private key even if it is encrypted, and so we also offer Public Only Cards. These you can pop into your wallet no hassle and receive crypto every time you flash it to someone willing to send funds. The funds go directly offline in a safe and secure address (or you can use them with your current wallet - no biggie) - which is nice. It's about as safe as you can get. 
So it's up to you really :)
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:23:08

You can also get a Public Only card that you can keep in your wallet - it makes receiving funds from your friends, aquaintences and ATM's a breeze - just whip it out and collect that coin! (Insert joke here) Also, the funds go directly offline, which is nice. Here's what the Public Only cards look like:

Cheers! Thank you! All the orders we received this week will be laser etched Monday or the next day (depending on when they came) in and should ship shortly after that!

We can take payment in any Crypto coin - if you'd like to pay in a different coin just add a note and our sales team will give you an address and do the conversion for you! However we are Crypto only - 100%, and we pay our suppliers in BTC as well - fiat is dead - the world just hasn't noticed yet :)

Side Note: The fact that Africa is starting to gather more Bitcoin is fantastic to hear.
@_date: 2014-06-05 02:40:01
Done! Now on the cart page it will suggest the matching card for the coin types that you've already added to your cart - You'll have to re enter the public key - but thats the best way for us to manage the order and produce the card.

Well, you can store the BIP encrypted private key elsewhere in case the card is lost, but the goal is to have this in a safe place. You can order two cards and store them in separate locations, without the pass phrase there is no loss in security given you have multiple cards.

This is true, the threshold temperature for Aluminium is 600c and while a house fire would likely burn this card up, it would also burn up a hardware wallet, computer or paper wallet with ease. Perhaps the best method is to store separate copies in two locations, or simply order a public only card and use your BIP38 Passphrase like a brainwallet.

Don't sweat it - I think your tutorial is a pretty good read for beginners. A lot of new folks get into the game and months go by before they consider cold storage. 
We had a similar experience and wanted to offer a solution for new people that takes 2 minutes to get in order. Using BIP38 and offline wallet packages you spoke about - they can order an aluminium element proof Crypto Card.
We just wanted to chime in because we come in at the end of the key generation process and users don't need to rely on electrical hardware - it's also far more resilient that paper as well.
