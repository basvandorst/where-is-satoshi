No, but i can make life easy enough that i can focus on art instead of work. And if i took out only 100k theres still the chance i could take out another 100k two years later without putting too much of a dent in it.

Almost back to 14 on binance not a catastrophe at all
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:30:11
Honestly it looks like we found the bottom at 12000. I would wager its on its way back up right now. If your going tp get in now is the time.

Do you live in a larger city? Ive lived in nyc austin and portland. If you want to live near a population center, you woupd very much get the impressionthat the US is running out of land to build on.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:07:36
Of course i also knew i would make bank from thanksgiving to xmas so it may be a different situation. But honestly 300 bucks is a parking ticket. I wouldnt normally tell someone to invest more than they say they can afford but even if your poor thats not life changing money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:32:10
Whoa whoa... to be fair... i am not confident enough to narrow it down to a spread of 11,000. I chose 12,000 for a reason.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:10:43
Thats my guess. Then stable for a week
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:49
Oh... jesus. Thats painful. What a fucking moron though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:58:50
I agree that bitcoin will soon lose its market dominance. However I dont think "crash" is the word. It will remain a store of value similar to gold. However while the crypto market cap will most likely 10X over the next few years Bitcoin will most likely only double or triple in the same time frame.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:13
Poor guy. But if he was that stupid if it wasnt that it would have been something else i suppose. Maybe he got back in at the same price on the way back up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:30:55
How old are you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:43
Yeah you need to verify your identity. Is that a big problem? It would be a shame to pass up the entire opportunity because you dont want them to know who you are. They need to cover their ass for taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:12:24
Thanks for this, thoughts ive had myself, and advice ive given. It would be tragic to have a million "had it and lost everything"  stories floating around a year from now. I believe in crypto, bit not enough to pass up a lifetime of security to pursue a lavish billionaire lifestyle no one really needs.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:26:25
Thats literally comparing apples to cryptos.... or something like that. Cryptos arent companies they are currencies. A better comparison would be the total amount of dollars, euros or yen in circulation. Or if cryptos ever become the primary form of currency, all of those combined.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:23:30
Please elaborate i dont know what your refering to
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:16
Congrats man. You found the sweetspot. On the next crash you can rest easy its not going back to 13 again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:02:26
I couldnt speculate on the exact value of the house in 10 years but I would assume the rental value would continue to rise. At least in portland. So i suppose a 200,000 house rented out at 2000 a month for 10 years... would be about 240,000 in the bank at that point. So from there its all profit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:33:17
He meant for him. He can no longer lose.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:58
I weep for him. But if he is that stupid i suppose if it wasnt tjis it would have been something else.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:45
Your right. This is a good time. You can make an account on coinbase. Just download the app and take it from there. Once you have it, i recomend moving it to an exchange like binance and diversify it a bit with some solid alts. Research them well and ask multiple opinions. Pick at least 5 in addition to bitcoin. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:33:06
How bout i bet you a million iota that im right.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:40:06
Okay you can have the cocktail napkin its written on, but im keeping the frame.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:41:28
You need to relax. Alts have always dipped with bitcoin. They are recovering faster. This dip was common sense everyone saw it coming. Its healthy and normal. In fact now that the spotlight is so heavily on cryptos, something like this will show all the newcomers that these things arent the end of the world. Im celebrating.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:32:03
Dont stress it man. Your fine. Although it couldnt hurt to diversify soon with some alts. Ripple is making this much more bearable for me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:05:21
Id go for 300. As long as you can pay your rent. Just work some overtime. About 6 weeks ago i had 1000 lying around. Used that and put another 2000 on my credit card. Almost 75% paid off and my alt investments tripled in that time. I would consider some alts over bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:37:46
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:08
What about owning a house and renting it out for 20 years, or even several houses. Wouldnt that be a sound investment? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:14:18
Is that to say, dont take out 100 grand when your portfolio hits a million? Is that how you feel about it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:16:45
He sold it. He said so. Hes going to wind up hating himself even more in a year 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:10:02
Hes not. (If your talking to OP) he bought in 3 weeks ago and has been tweaking out since. Did no research, doesnt know what he bought.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:03:25
I can respect that. But if i can kinda 90% do that (convictions and shit) and 10% not have to wait tables again for the rest of my life... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:35:48
I've developed a technique i call "panic HODLing" for situations like this
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:43:52
Yeah. That makes me an idiot. Tell me, what would i have to do to be an asshole?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:20:27
Fair enough. Although I defy you to find a more accurate prediction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:04:39
It seems like the botton was 12000. We should stablize around 15000 for a while and start on a more measured and reasonable rise. I would guess 21000 by mid january. Not an expert. But thats how previous dips look when you zoom out. My take is that major alts will take this opportunity to claim a larger market share. Bit coins dominance may only be 30-40% of the market cap in a few days. I recommend Ethereum, NEO, IOTA, EOS, XRP, ADA and a handful of others to be the big winners in this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:12
100,000% is a fuck ton of certainty! I like your confidence sir!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:02:36
Go to bitcoin.com buy it there with a credot card
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:29:29
Your view is equally simplistic. Theres hodl for the sake of hodl and then theres a thoughtful analysis of future utility. I personally do not hold bitcoin, but for the coins i do hold, a 40% drop would not disturb me because I can see a future circumstance where their value will become more tangable. When I experience FUD those memes give me morale. Thats pretty much all this is to me. I made my decisions, Im confident in them, but on days like yesterday these memes are like a support group.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:20:07
I do. Im just lazy. Look no apostrophe in my "its"
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:41:21
Dont be my friend, just hang in there. It wont be long before your laughing at yourself for worrying
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:57:06
Find a bitcoin atm
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:22:28
That is true. Personally i would pay a property manager to deal with all the bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:41
I honestly watched that entire video thinking there was a person in there. It was terrifying
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:29
Thats a 90% drop in confidence in 3 minutes.... I'm panic selling
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:12:44
Yeah this is totally normal. The percentage matvhes previous dips, its just more dramatic with larger numbers and a lot of media coverage. My portfolio dipped 15% after tripling in a month. Im still smiling.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:10:04
Checked the charts. If you had bought a house in portland in 2007 it would be worth 50% more right now. If you sold it in 2012 youd be screwed of course but... its only a decade we are dealing with here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:28
I disagree very much.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:10:52
Yeah youll be fine. This is not a big deal. In a month youll be smiling.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:15:59
When has that ever been bad advice? No matter how valueable your crypto is you cant live in it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:56:31
And 3 hours later its up to 14k
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:57:42
Idk. From your worldview i assumed you were over 50
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:47
Are you saying tge panic will come in a few weeks or in a few weeks we will say " what panic"
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:41
This. Dont get me wrong anything can happen. But this is what ussually happens so i would place my bet on this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:09:29
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:30:52
Whatz the issue with .com?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:46
The WSJ is confusing people with those comparisons. They should be more clear that there is no real comparison. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:13
What makes gold valueable then? The utiity of it doesn't justify its cost, most of its value is derived from people attributing value to it. If peiple arpund the world believe it has value then it does. Thats how basically everything of value works.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:47:31
I also figured it would take him an hour to sign up for coinbase
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:23:46
Um... are you that determimes to believe hes evil? You cant see how this situation could have happened to anyone of us in his position?
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:27:15
Okay... your really reaching, you seem determined to continue villifying him rather than listening to what hes saying... your american arent you?
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:01:37
I did mean to put that elsewhere, i think i meant to respond to what you were responding to. Sorry. Btw I am American, have lived in 6 states. Americans love to willfully misunderstand information to reinforce their own beliefs.
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:22:28
That sounds right. He says he doesnt want the billion, or for anyone else involved to get it. If he gets it he would have control of his portion, which he sees fit. But thats apparently only a portion of it abd not enough to make things right
@_date: 2018-12-16 05:30:21
Im not sure why it says that. Ive been on here for a couple of years.
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:26:36
Yes but not all sexual acts are fungible... BELIEVE ME...
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:42:30
I think crypto as a currency is a long way off, but crypto that offers blockchain solutions to other real world problems will start to appreciate in value  in 3 to 5 years. Imo
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:24:37
That was precisely the situation in the 90s with the .com boom. 95% of all crypto projects will disapear over the next 5 years then the remaining few will begin to follow the pattern they followed in 2017 except stretched out over a decade instead of a year. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:16:15
Haha, i really hope not... My best guess would be 10x in 20 years. If it happens fast again itd just cause another big crash, and another that soon could sour people forever. Once we are free from the toxic, "get rich quick" culture then crypto can start to prosper in a normal healthy way.
