I think it has a lot further to fall. A lot of negative press today, which will only be compounded by the negative press tomorrow as a result of this fall.
Lot's of so called experts saying it is a pyramid scheme or it has no value.

I flattered you care enough to browse my post history. Something wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:09:57
Yes, but I have still not seen anything that disproves it. Do you know of any sources?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:40:57
It won't. Its a failed experiment.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:23:33
Thanks, very interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:29:55
$10,105.83 right now. Dropped $100 in last couple of minutes. It is dropping like a rock.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:24:49
Good for you, as it is just about to go sub 10k.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:30:42
It won't be long. Dropping like a rock the last few minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:43:56
I do. Tether needs to disappear, and this high speculation on Bitcoin needs to end.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:20:13
He doesn't. He was talking about selling another coin in December at a loss. Check his comment history.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:20:46
So much desperation for people to buy.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:46:35
I think there are some people trying to instill confidence so that the run on Bitcoin is halted.  Plus some bargain hunters. Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:59:23
Any particular reason you say that? Has it been debunked somewhere?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:44:55
Just trying to hype up the market, but I don't believe it. This bubble is bursting.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:47:04
I doubt it, but I do think it could be in the $4-6k range.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:28:41
You should have waited. Some bargains coming in the coming days. Will be sub 10k soon (watching price on Coinbase right now). Dropped $100 in last 2 minutes alone.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:24:43
They why not give bitcoin an underlying asset like dollars and stop the speculation. Just allow it to be used TO SEND AN OBJECT WITHOUT A MIDDLE MAN TO ANYONE IN THE WORLD.
Currently it is being used like a Ponzy scheme. A get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:33:34
Yes. I predict so many new investors will have lost money on this that it will put them off for life. It's not going back up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:52:01
Proof? What a load of rubbish.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:32:54
Yeh, this recent rise wasn't sustainable. The potential losses will spook so many recent investors now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:41:09
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:42:26
I'm not.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:09:15
Lol, so much denial today.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:26:56
Yep, predict sub 10k in about 15-30 minutes time. Dropping like a rock right now. Everyone is spooked.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:26:42
Presumably you can deduct expenses such as electricity from that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:38
Stop preying on Newbies. Now is a terrible time to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:09:53
I hope you didn't buy at $7430. It just went down below $7k in the last few minutes.
