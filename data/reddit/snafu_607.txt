Depends on whether that average joe enjoys the finer end of the illegal side of certain things.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:25:27
I have not bought any in nearly a year, though.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:25:51
If it gets under 100 usd, though. I think I may have to invest in a couple. It will go back up. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:29:21
Is what I have used for the past few years. If you're interested. Good luck! =)
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:15:32
localbitcoins.com maybe? I accept tips if it helps. lol. I'll link my wallet addy if so. gonna take me a week to sync the damn thing back up with the blockchain, though. lol
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:50:03
Really? Under 200? I have not checked in a couple months. I may have to invest. My first 3 btc I ever bought were 20 bucks per coin. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:17:41
Lol. Thanks! I feel more gooderest about muhsef now.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:24:46
I don't either. As I mentioned. I store mine offline. On my own wallet. Which I make my own address's for.
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:30:33
Clever. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:21:24
You could just simply use  I guess. I like to use an offline wallet, though. I think that is what you mean by "cold storage"?
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:43:38
Eh. Two month ago it was at 300. 9 months ago it was 900 or so. It's not crazy prices as it used to be. To be honest with ya. It's incentive for me to perhaps grab a couple coins and see what happens. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:19:20
I just use btc offline. It's that simple. However syncing up with the blockchain is going to take you a bit. You do not need a tipping thing. Just a place to store the coins, I link my addy, you send from where ever your coins are, of whatever amount. 
I can assist you if you like?
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:24:05
Still selling at nearly 200, though.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:54:50
'voila', sorry. I'm an idiot. Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:24:52
I am purely speculating here. Russia closed off all access to bitcoin sites Monday, I think? Perhaps this has had an affect?
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:33:19
Mmmmmm. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:22:04
localbitcoins.com If it helps! Toss me some! I'll link ya my wallet addy! :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:51:33
I will buy as many as I can then! Oh, and I used to be able to go into Walmart and get them! Walk up to customer service, yadda yadda yadda, go home and walla! 
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:29:36
100k?! Lol. Never seen them that high. But, I just checked localbitcoins.com and they're ranging from low 100's to low 200's per coin.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:31:04
I guess it's better than waiting for that package?
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:56:29
That's why I always try to look "fresh as hell" for when the feds are watchin'. =)
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:47:36
You stating here that you use it for "extra curricular" probably is an unwise decision. I mean, those people really do not even know what btc are, let alone what you're doing with it. 
As long as you move it properly you should always be fine...$315 in btc is not a lot anyway(it is too me, though)....Sounds like a error somewhere on cvs or the moneygram....You may be out that cash..
Hope I am wrong.
Always get a receipt, yo! Just don't keep them.
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:11:45
You're a few years too late. I am assuming it's for shipping....ask on the sites forum you ordered from.
