I actually tried to release a binary for Debian and Ubuntu. The cross-platform GUI framework I am using is having serious problems with taskbar icon in Ubuntu, so I am waiting for them to fix it. But otherwise, Aether is alive &amp; working in Linux— I'm just waiting for that bugfix.

Exactly. And a catchier name.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:00:41
Thanks! I'm starting to slowly talk about it as I become more confident in its abilities. Feel free to recommend if you hear anything.

Well, some places do that, they go even as far as preventing Tor logins, but I didn't mean that. In general, any place that happens to have a central leadership is susceptible to their wishes. Not specific to Tor. This thing doesn't have moderation.

This is the norm, though we had around 50 around peak :) the amount of people connected is unrelated to the amount of people you can interact, though. This is very new, and I need to learn how to build a community. :)

Read the source code and compile it for yourself, you don't have to use my binaries :).
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:57:35
Yes, but I don't have the resources to buy that kind of audit. If you know any experts that would be interested in this pro-bono, I would love to help it any way I can.

Votes and blocking. But it's an unsolved problem, admittedly. I'm working on it.

It depends on the user. The default behaviour is to ask for 6 months worth of posts, but the user can choose a different timespan, or none at all. Depending on the time chosen, when a deadline hits, posts older than x months are removed from db, and the client stops asking remotes for posts older than x months in the same time. By default, 6 months is the deadline where stuff will be dead unless saved to 'saved items', where they are kept indefinitely.

Sure, that's why it is open-- someone you trust can verify it. Enjoy :)

Comparatively, Bitmessage is whatsapp. This is reddit.

Thank you!

Think of it like that: why does bitcoin have no "moderators"(banks)? It does not because when someone gets into that position of power, human nature is bound to abuse it. I am not denying that there are advantages to having moderators—and there are advantages to banks too, such as reversible transactions. But reversible transactions can be used to screw people, and moderation powers, too. It's a tradeoff— I am letting the free market to define the value of a comment. 
There are 'topics' (Aether's subreddits) sorted by popularity on the topic selection page by the way.

Whoa, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:38:51
Exactly. Something in me tells that I'm going to be very, *very* sorry for that, but we'll see.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:56:33
No, I don't. I'm as powerful and powerless as you are. I have no 'mod' rights.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:56:07
That's on the roadmap!
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:45:34
Here you go:

Probably! As far as I could search, SmartScreen looks like an IE feature, not a Windows feature. Just download it via Firefox or Chrome, if you can.

Well, it's a similar tradeoff to bitcoin not having any intermediaries such as banks. Banks also have an incentive to moderate only fraud and people can move to a more fair one, but in reality that's not how it work. A bank can be in bed with legislators, and a moderator can be in bed with Propaganda ministry of an autocratic state. Besides, it is structurally impossible to moderate. You can't even edit, or delete anything you post (they automatically disappear after 6 months), you can change your name whenever you want, there is no user registration— there is no basis on which you can ban people, there is no central server which you can sit on top on and decree who gets into the moot and who does not. This is truly decentralized, with all the beauty and horror it entails.

Yes, but this is not a reddit replacement. Accessing reddit via Tor might make you anonymous to reddit, but it does not guarantee that mods will not just delete your posts. Aether guarantees both distribution *and* anonymity.
