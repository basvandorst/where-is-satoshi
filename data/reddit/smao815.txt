I understand basic supply and demand. It's just confusing when the word "deflationary" is used to describe a limited supply that would eventually push prices up.. (assuming stable demand)

What happens to bitcoins that are lost due to loss of key?

So the term deflation in this case refers to the finite number of bitcoins rather than a decrease in prices.. that distinction would of made things more clearer since an economics 101 student normally associate deflation with the latter

The question is, since we have seen such a steep rise as of late, is the dip imminent and what price will it dip to?
In my opinion, I THINK it will dip given the steepness is not like anything in the past. Could be wrong (CBW)

Don't "normies" get scammed all the time? and more so because they are new and unaware of securities measures

I love how any bad news is considered FUD. How are you meant to have a rational discussion on pros vs cons if you ignore the cons. Seems very dogmatic to me, like a cult.

Is a cryptocurrency that relies on miners truly decentralised?

The guy (like most guys) don't have technical knowledge so it'll be a waste reading their technical reasoning but instead asks a person who can digest that knowledge to summarise. Don't think he's looking to be told what to think imo
