Marijuana shops in CO are having a hard enough time managing cash since most banks won't do business with them. I imagine doing business in large volume would be even harder, because how would you convert large sums of BTC &gt; cash.

It was great at first in my market with few drivers and decent rates, but that changed. Once the rates lowered I was making considerably less. After mileage, gas, vehicle depreciation, taxes, and waiting 40+ minutes for a &lt;$6 fare it became less worth it. 
No fights with the taxi drivers though.

As a content creator I'd be upset if someone posted my work and was getting incentivized to do so. Buzzfeed is a notorious content mill that sucks up anything it can to post for profit to the ire of creators. How will you differentiate yourself?

Think about the money you would spend on mining equipment and electricity just to mine $1 per week. That's going to start you off in the negative to begin with. It would take a very loooooong time to make your investment pay for itself. Just buy the BTC.

A lot of people are content with their current banking companies. Emphasizing concepts such as nationless, decentralized, and the "be your own bank" aspects aren't compelling reasons to switch from the ease of using a debit or credit card. They're non-starters.
