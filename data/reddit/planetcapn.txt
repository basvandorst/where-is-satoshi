As someone who supported BU for a while, I now am in favor of segwit. The censoring on r/bitcoin made me doubt segwit for a while, I mean why would you need censorship? It only gives people like Roger Ver cannon fodder for getting people to support BU. We need a common sense argument where both sides are heard and then people can decide.
