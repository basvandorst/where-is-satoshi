This is inaccurate.
We received a court order to provide the information. We fought the summons in federal court and it was narrowed from 500,000 customer records to 13,000 customer records.

We have one engineer working full-time on Lightning. We have multiple engineers working on our bitcoin infrastructure.
We're hiring senior software engineers to work on both our own bitcoin infrastructure as well as open source contributions to Bitcoin, Lightning, etc.

If you know qualified senior software engineers who wanted to work on this, we would love to meet them. :)

We've been paying attention. We had to get through 2 hard forks (albeit one that didn't end up happening), first. :)

Link/DM to your GitHub and/or LinkedIn and I can pass along to our recruiting team.

We are a 300 person company; we are not a major Silicon Valley company yet. :)
We are trying to hire engineers for this as fast as possible. Challenge is finding senior software engineers that want to work at Coinbase on this. Anecdotally, a lot of people who are qualified to work on open source protocols in the space don't want to work at a company.

Based on customer feedback, we spent the fall getting ready for the SegWit2x hard fork. Despite the social media narrative, we were doing this to ensure customers had access to both chains at the time of the fork. That's it.
After SegWit2X didn't happen, we finished our Bitcoin Cash integration.
After that, we implemented SegWit.
We have limited resources—but always trying to hire more senior software engineers—so we prioritized projects in order of impact to customers.
Our general principle is do the right thing for customers. You can argue with the order/prioritization, but all of those actions were done to benefit customers. If you apply Occam's Razor to how we do things, it's generally accurate. :)
