It's a transaction, when you do work for someone you expect to get paid immediately.  I am going to assume you're joking at this point.

Try an international transfer experiment.  Set up a transfer recipient and send $5 internationally via your bank and then send $5 USD via bitcoin.  What you will find is the bitcoin was received immediately by your international friend with pennies in transaction fees, and your bank transfer will take 1 to 4 days with paperwork for you to fill out and the bank fees will be more expensive than the $5 transfer.  It's incredible, give it a try sometime, we all have international colleagues and friends these days online, it's easy to transfer value for anything now.

Transferring money isn't instant

I never quite understood why the similar concept of sms integrated quiz type shiws never took off.

You're wrong, you must live in the USA, there are lots of exchanges.

Those are similar concerns with carrying cash.

Your hatred for bitcoin is palpable.  Getting angry at new technologies because you don't understand them is a great strategy, good luck with that.

The internet has changed the time frame in which things can snowball.  Billion dollar companies appear out of nowhere, it used to take decades to build billion dollar companies.  The old rules and way of thinking don't apply anymore, there will be a trigger, or a tipping point, something unforeseen and the game will completely change with the power of the net.

Why wait when you don't need to?  Would you ever want to wait to be paid for a cash transaction or prefer to get the cash right away?

It seems the ATM's in SE Asia are becoming rather creative with the various regulations and a Singapore company is making progress.  They have the benefit of being local.  Do you have many ambassadors in South East Asia and/or expansion plans?

You don't understand bitcoins confirmations, you're numbers are wrong.  There is no faster way to transfer value than bitcoin.  Send $5 USD of value to your online friend in another country.  do it through your bank account first then via bitcoin.  Calculate the service fees and the length of time it takes for your friend to receive his money, and report back.

You've obviously never transferred any money or you would know it's not always instant.

Yea they’re so sour about it, and they don’t even realize how sad it makes them look. I get it if they’re ten years old but some of them are probably adults.
