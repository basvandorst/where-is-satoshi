And I would wager that the vast majority of them have ample protection, and keep their money in well protected banks, that couldn't transfer money into an untraceable account within a matter of minutes. Someone could just waltz into this guy's house, kick down the door, put a gun to his head, and demand that his half a *billion* dollars worth of btc be transferred to their account. It would be the easiest and most profitable robbery in history.

Actually it was drug dealers that lost the majority of coin, to the admins or the "hackers"

He's been to prison before for it, but it's not that simple. He actually knows police, they sometimes give him tips about drug dealers they know about but don't have enough evidence to bust. Then him and his buddies storm in, rob and or kill everyone, and the cops act like it was just gang rivalry, case closed. 
The last time I saw him was 8 or 9 years ago also, so he may have another line of work by now, like worm food. It's really fucked up actually, I think the cops he was friends with were also part of the arayan brotherhood, and they would get some of the cash and or drugs from the robberies.

@_date: 2014-03-06 14:33:44
Give it time, I'm positive that it will happen once organized crime catches up to the technology. Just think like a criminal for a minute. You rob drug dealers for a living, very dangerous people with loads of cash just sitting around, but also are willing and able to kill you if you fuck up. Now what's an easier target, a well armed drug dealer with maybe a couple hundred thousand dollars? Or some dorky guy with a couple million? how about half a billion? 
Ever watch the wire? think Omar, the stick up man. I know a guy like that, except he's in the Arayan brotherhood, white power nazi guys. They dress up like cops and kick in the doors of drug dealers, rob them of all their cash, and sometimes kill them anyway. 
I'm not saying this is an imminent threat to btc holders, but people rob and kill over much less. And there are people out there who do this for a living, and they're not stupid, they'll catch on eventually that there are easy, soft targets out there with piles of digital cash, who would likely shit their pants if someone so much as pulled a gun on them.

Likely intentional, influence exerted by interested parties. I noticed in another thread today, the same comment, seo spun, made by 3 or 4 different usernames. It stood out because it mentioned dogecoin and bitcoin interchangeably in the same sentence in each posting.

Um, yes I am saying that they're in the same danger. Shit, when I've done localbitcoins transactions, I'm always amazed at how trusting everyone is. Sure I'll bring $4000 in hundreds to a mcdonalds parking lot at 11:30 at night to meet some guy I've never met before, and exchange for currency frequently utilized by very unscrupulous characters. I'm not trying to knock btc, I love it, but you have to admit, the whales are laughably easy targets to the right motivated person or group of people. I personally know at least 2 people who would do this if they knew the first thing about btc, one of which previously made a living robbing drug dealers. 
Here's the scenario:
"I don't have the keys anymore"
Bam, you're son's hand now has a hole in it
"His head is next unless you remember those keys"
I'm certain people have been killed over far less money.

As they say, when seconds count, the police are only minutes away.
This already is how it is, and we're choking with regulation. I live near Detroit, and the average response time for police is over 45 minutes, in a city that, if it were a country, would have the fourth highest murder rate in the world.

I've though similar things about the sheer amount of data about people that is posted here. I mean people bare their heart and soul here, they get their kink out, they talk about stories they wouldn't share with their closest friends, and share their secrets. 
One of the things i love about this place is that everyone can be completely themselves, who they are in their minds, hold nothing back. Shit if they could aggregate all the shit I've posted about myself across all the accounts I've had, I'll bet they would know me better than I know myself. The sheer amount of data is staggering. Shit, maybe the reason they don't improve it more is *because* this is all a big data mining operation.
I love these ideas though, and I'm sure some of the admins have thought about similar ones. I think they are afraid of ruining the good thing they have and driving people away. 
There is one friend I've made here, we say hi whenever we see each other's names in posts, and I've had great conversations with others a few times. It could be so much more though, you're right. 
There is such a wealth of information here, just having some way of tagging posts so the search functionality worked a bit better would be monumental. There is so much good content I see on a daily basis that I wished I could find again, but didn't have the good sense to save or forward to myself.

Also curious, from what I've read it seems like the answer is: "it depends" 
Something I heard recently learning about a friend's medical marijuana business was that his lawyer told him that if he ends up in a courtroom, he's already fucked up. You might be able to defend yourself, you might not, the law's a bit of a grey area.
I think the same applies to trading Bitcoin. You should be fine doing it, and it's not technically illegal, so long as you don't get too big or draw too much attention from the wrong people. I think the issue is that you *can* be prosecuted for trading Bitcoin, and like it or not defending yourself will likely be more trouble than it's worth.

The constitution specifically outlines what powers we give to the government, not what rights are given to the people. All rights are implicitly granted if they are not specifically restricted. The government we have today is nothing like the authors of the constitution intended. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:18:29
Within the bounds of their own constitution, which are similarly restrictive.

They generally lean libertarian when it comes to issues like domestic spying. With a big dash of crony capitalism on top.

Why are you here?
@_date: 2013-06-04 13:19:44
What about the issue of account and password theft? When I had my cc number stolen last summer, my bank took a little hit when they credited me back the fraudulent purchases made. I'm not sure if/how they ever recovered that money, but I imagine it would be that much harder to do with bitcoin transactions, as they are by nature, non-reverseable. This doesn't necessarily make it impossible for banks to offer this kind of service, it just makes it much easier to convert liquid Capitol from a bank account to unrecoverable bitcoin, and send it to anonymous  address.
 I feel like some of the security of bitcoin is in its obscurity (thats not exactly the word I'm looking for), and difficulty to convert from and to. The cumbersome step of getting your cash into an account from which you can buy bitcoin is precisely what prevents a compromised account from loosing everything. I suppose a 2 factor auth. would work pretty well at deterring this, but it's something I believe banks need to consider when integrating bitcoin into their system.
Also, how did you become a bitcoin consultant? I'm pretty well versed in all things bitcoin, but I feel like I would be overstepping if I called myself that. I imagine the concept of relative expertise applies here, but I'm curious just how much one would need to know about bitcoin before consulting on a professional level. I'm a bit of a salesman already, but lack a bit in a technical understanding. What sort of background did you come from which led you to this?

Yes, using their service like this kills your anonymity, but you don't need to use their service to acquire bitcoin. Shit YOU killed your anonymity when you used your cc and Paypal. Buy in cash only and you're good, or send your coins through a tumbler, then the blockchain only shows that you bought those coins at some point, not that you currently own them. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:53:12
Check out their new online options, shit, I might set up a sellers account there soon

It may be a pita right now, but we are still at version .08 (or .07, whatever), technically this whole thing is still in beta testing. Once the btc economy really gets going, I'm sure there will still be anonymous cash options, as well as we'll regulated sellers that make things easy. Until then...

Once you do the verification dance, you should be fine. There's a bit of a learning curve when it comes to bitcoin, and figuring out all of the channels your money has to go through to become bitcoin is just one of the hurdles. Keep at it, I'm sure virwox will square things with you. They're not going to ruin their reputation over $150

Try localbitcoins.com, you can buy in cash from plenty of people if you are near a large metro area. Or you can buy them online from people using various other transaction methods. I'll sell you some for cash if you are near southeast Michigan.
