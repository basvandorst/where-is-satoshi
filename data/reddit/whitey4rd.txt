I have a Keepkey and it's great.

I get paid every two weeks and I usually buy about $300 worth of BTC each check.  I'd say 50% of my savings are in BTC at this point.  A bit in ETH as well.

thank you.  Funny part is that I'm 39 and have been fucking HORRIFIC with money my whole life.  Blowing it on booze, women, technology, etc.  Bitcoin and ETH has actually motivated me to save and I've been able to save $4,000 USD in 2 months which is like $4 million for me haha.  Heres to us both having a nice nest egg!

yeah you're right every time someone asks its always "get a Trezor or Ledger".  Its my first hardware wallet, and I'm fairly new to Bitcoin, but I cant see any features that I'd need that its lacking.

Same thing happened to me. I've had an account for 3 months and all of a sudden when I went to but more Bitcoin I was taken to a page to verify my identity again. I had already done that by uploading my license. This time they made me use my webcam and it took me 8 tries because they kept saying it was too blurry.

I'm really trying to do this but being fairly new to BTC and having minimal stock trading experience, I never know how to spot a dip. I mean yes I can tell she  it's going down I'm not an idiot,  but I never know when it's stopping before it goes back up. I'm sure not many people do except hardcore people who look at graphs,  follow news closely, etc. I have a busy life and two small kids so I've just been buying 3-400 worth every 2 weeks for the past 2 months and started when it was at about  $700. Any advice would be welcome.

I can only speak for the one I have, but my Keep Key arrived yesterday and it was pretty user friendly.  I plugged it into my PC, downloaded the Chrome plugin, wrote down my 12 word recovery sentence, named my device, and transferred my Bitcoin to it all in a matter of 5 minutes.  Then of course I tatted the recovery sentence on my face a la Mike Tyson.

I right there with you.  Ive been terrible with money my whole life (i just turned 39).  Ive just gotten to the point in the past 5 years where i make $100k, but blow it on dumb stuff.  I get about 4 new cell phones a year, and buy tons of tech gadgets (I'm in the IT world).  I got into Bitcoin in 2016 and now have become almost obsessive with saving money and buying Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Each paycheck I put some in savings, and buy $250 worth of BTC.  I believe in BTC, but figure even if it crashes someday and I lose it all, I would have blown it on something dumb anyways.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:22:51
I agree.  The way I see it I've always been bad with money and usually blow it on dumb stuff, so even if BTC goes to zero I'm no worse off than I would have been.  I'm betting against that however.

I've been thinking of doing this as well. My cousin wants to go in with me and he has half the seed money. They are building a new casino near me and I'll apply for a license to put the BTC ATM in it. You'd  be hard pressed to find a place with more foot traffic. Not sure what the license fees will be in Massachusetts. I'm thinking once the initial investment is made back it's a nice source of passive income.

Don't forget her followup:
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:12:57
She sure is taking France by storm. She's made some really scathing speeches recently and seems to have big support like Trump did. If she's an enemy of Bitcoin however she must be defeated.

I know I have a Gemini account but was on the go all day and was doing it all from my phone.  Wish Gemini had an app

You can probably grab one on Coinbase with a debit card with a small limit if you upload your ID.  Is started with a $300 debit card limit. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:30:57
lets put it this way I initiated a withdrawal to my hardware wallet 10 hours ago and I still dont have it.  The TX ID they are showing that says "completed" doesnt exist on the Blockchain
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:30:28
thanks I'll try it next time.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:50:35
Yeah exactly that's why I decided against it.  
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:22:28
You'll probably want Southern NH so you can work in Mass/Boston with a short commute but still enjoy the no income tax and low property prices.  My wife and I bought a house in Massachusetts in 2008 and it was about 1,800 square feet 3 bedroom 3 bathroom.  Paid about $340,000  Her friend bought a house in Southern NH for $330,000 a few weeks later and its 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3,500 square feet, 3 car garage, in ground pool, yard the size of a football field, etc.  Money goes a lot further in NH.

hahaha yes it does.

Lightning fast? My cousin waited 2 and a half weeks for a Coinbase order of $2500 to go through. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:58:49
That's my dilemma. I've been buying a bit since December and have ~3BTC now. Want to buy more but would love cheap coins if ETF is rejected. But will also be pissed if I wait,  it gets approved, and I miss out. Might just pull the trigger tomorrow since I'm long anyways EFF it.  
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:11:50
thanks.  It was just a market order.  Took almost 6 hours to settle.  Don't think I'll be using them anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:54:44
$10,000 minimum
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:55:46
I've had mine about a month now and no complaints. I've sent BTC to and from it with no issues. Seems pretty sturdy too. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:20:22
They actually already have a Bitcoin IRA company with a $10,000 minimum I looked into it. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:41:20
I've seen 8% for buying and 6% for selling so these fees seem on par
