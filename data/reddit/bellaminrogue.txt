Might affect the dollar, but not Bitcoin per se

18th is Global futures
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:04:50
Trading volume has increased by 25% in European market in the last 24 hours.
It's FOMO. People are putting tens of thousands if savings into Bitcoin now instead of hundreds

American Lambros, I'm ginger out for dinner with the wife later and can't bring my phone... can you just break the 13k barrier before I go so I don't have to be thinking about it! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:46:54
Why it's 13k day
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:12:32
It's going to hit 13 today, let's hope Bitcoin isn't superstitious  
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:54:51
€10k is the real tease
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:38:50
Crazy rise and fall is my expectation. Maybe even the quarterly dip (bot to 60% maybe but big!)
It's all speculation though, who knows!

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:44
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:52:55
It's listed as 12k but if you try to buy it defaults to the gdax price 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:48:36
I can see another dip, depending on Korea later, but if our new support base is €12.k/ $15.3k, I'll take that!
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:19:25
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:13:48
€13k... now €13.4k
This is the weirdest... 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:10:57
Anyone who's asked me recently has asked in terms of buying one whole coin. Bullish speculation from individuals with some savings to invest based on mainstream press. I reckon $10k is the new average for newcomer investors

Market doesn't close so there's that, but also that's a ridiculous lift. The amount traded 8s way down at weekends so it's odd that the rise has been so sudden.
15k by Christmas is more feasible with a dip between now and then 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:52:01
There as less a wall and more a small fence at 11k that got blown down

@_date: 2017-12-08 14:49:59
Unless you have experience day trading, avoid that. F*cking stress levels as you sell and realise it was the bottom of the dip... Or was it... Is it... Should I buy in now at a loss.... etc
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:04
It is going to be a frenzy

Last week....
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:10:12
Zoom out a week. It's been a spectacular few weeks guys but we'll get over these walls and keep growing.
Only saying this because I've been celebrating the €10k wall break with cans! Salubrious!  
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:48:42
It's a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:51:15

@_date: 2017-12-03 20:35:37
Aaaaaanddd it's gone 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:46
I got a few friends in at €10k a few weeks ago, and sold them at €15k... I got shit the other day for not holding til 16k or more, but I assume they'll understand now. 
Dumped all my Bitcoin at the same time, but had a few bits floating in other exchanges I finally dumped today. It'll bounce, but not today!
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:31:26
This is ridiculous!! Imminent complete shitshow today I'd say... in the best possible crypto way 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:18:36
Not necessarily. Nobody knows. It's the wild west man.
This isn't normal, but there is ntohing to compare it to. We're either just getting past the 'dial up' stage of the 'internet of money' or we're being set up for a short. 
Nobody knows. It's ridiculous. Every fibre of my being is saying to sell but the Bitcoiner in me is saying HODL, and HODL I shall!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:18:30
No time like the present

Didn't go low enough to trigger my buy threshold so all in all... nothing happens. As you were 
Someone got a lambo. Good work 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:52:59
That's my Hodl for now. Slow climb, probably adaped more long term! Its a dice roll, that's why I'm out of BTC. Too much happening, too many what if's and expecting to check a value and see a three digit number again!

last week, that was when it hit 7.5k and nobody could buy
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:16
No, the volume has been low the last 2 hours, now there's just a mass panic after a few big sells. Low volume is easier to pump and dump

Guys I'm outta Bitcoin as of last week and I'm checking in to remind you all to invest off the market and market influences. Don't trade off of FUD or bullshit in here! I checked in to check the reaction to the dip and saw all the alarm bells.
Guys if this is the new "holding price" for Bitcoin just hold and wait. It's going to he past $20k by the end of the year it looks like. Take advice from influences not the daily thread 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:02:18
Which exchange? One BTC is $11701 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:23:55
This is why I love decentralised currencies. 
Technically what happens in the US should. Only affect your dollar. Obviously that might affect buying power etc but the more crypto takes off the less world events will affect your own personal accounts 
If you're English and brexit tanks the pound, your bitcoin will still be strong 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:12:51
Haven't seen those size transactions going through but I do get the feeling a few bigger whales are working a coordinated pump and dump. maybe even pre CME.

You most certainly can, or Ethereum
Bitfenix is less user friendly than Coinbase but it's manageable and there's a few tutorials online
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:32:57
Your money your decision..
Truth be told nobody knows. And the 18th is a bigger concern I'd think 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:10:14
ETH (Ethereum) is a cryptocurrency, Bitfenix is a website. (An exchange much like Coinbase or GDAX)

This surge is insane. In the € market there's an absolute deluge of tiny purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:28:25
Thanks buddy. They're already earmarked for numerous grown up things that I've been putting off this year. I may swing a new bike out of it but we'll see

50 quid to go!! Come on Bitcoin!

Cash out original investment and hodl the rest very soon

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:08:49
That's always been me too, but BTC went to crazy this week. I was a hodl-er but that kind of growth just scared the shit out of me!
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:27:11
Some back alley somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:40:09
Either a surge up way past to 10700 and then a dip or just a complete crazy day towards an ATH 
Once it breaks 10k and all the major channels start talking crypto again I think IOTA will bump huge! Laymen will see Microsoft attached and go balls deep

....I really hope so....
How about a 3ds
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:52:31
I sold my entire stack... and bought back in after the minor dip! 
I was so stress free for a few seconds til trading resumed! Then I had FOMO
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:49
This bubble has popped a hundred times.... That's why we sell high and buy when everyone has abandoned ship
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:44:59
How about a physical address to send real gold
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:03
If it does what it did last week, when it plummeted to 7.5k and crashed GDax/ CB then we're in for another week of sharp rises to correct

Last chance to buy sub £9k....

18th is Global futures
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:36:29
Are those small buys not FOMO buys though? 
When we do correct, there's going to be the biggest weak hands non hodl sell ever! Maybe even sub 9 again but even if it does we'll just bounce back up again.
This is fucking insane
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:37:33
Aaand down we go
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:06:12
Watch the graph every time it hits 9990 or 9999....
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:42:08
20 bucks a week is a great place to start! No harm at all investing in your future if you don't mind the possibility of that $20 becoming $1 or less! 
Only invest what you don't care if you lose!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:35:20
Which exact shit?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:10
Here it comes!!! And we're back

@_date: 2017-12-04 08:20:39
It''s a dollar issue, not a Bitcoin issue.
