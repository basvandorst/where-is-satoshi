Not true.  Several ASIC-resistant algos (including ethash/dagger-hashimoto) leverage vRAM quite heavily.  Most miners require a sizeable amount of system memory as well, although this is usually solved via increasing the pagefile size.

@_date: 2018-01-30 22:52:49
Are _you_?  The article literally addresses the very thing you keep parroting--with mathematical proof--and you keep pretending as though it's invalid.  With no proof of your own, of course, other than "the BitTorrent guy said so".
By the way, the exchange between the author and Bram Cohen basically went like this:  
**Cohen**:  There's nothing wrong with long routes.  
**Fyookball**:  My math shows otherwise...  
**Cohen**:  Then you're either being disingenuous, or you're just stupid.  You'd be mostly right, except the target node will ensure that it has formed enough connections to make the transaction happen!  
**Fyookball**:  Err, the target node cannot form a new connection without an on-chain transaction, so why bother using LN at all in that case?  
**Cohen**:  :crickets:  
  
If anything, Cohen's verbiage is a good example of how NOT to argue.
MIT doesn't operate in a vacuum.  Everyone there is subject to peer review.  If a theory cannot tolerate the scrutiny of peer review, then it's not a solid theory.  If you had any _actual_ proof to refute what was shown in that article, you would've cited it by now, ergo I have to assume that you don't have anything of value to add.  With that in mind, I'm going to take my leave here and continue to do research on my own.  Farewell!

He didn't say you did.  In fact, he specifically said this _isn't_ feasible. 
 Further, he said the best way is to connect to large semi-centralized hubs.


Nope.  Just one large, monopolistic one.  Not particularly dissimilar from the aforementioned configuration, particularly as hubs start charging access fees.


Not according to the math.  Connections have more properties than just which nodes they're connecting.  For example, they have a money constraint as well.  Not all connections are suitable for a given transaction.  See Part 3, section 3 to review the math.
Again, the easiest way to circumvent this is by joining large, centralized hubs with lots of liquidity.  Or have everyone dump huge amounts of money into their connections.


You're taking the numbers out of context.  10 was an example number he used to demonstrate a configuration that would require fewer hops so he could contrast it to a configuration that would require more hops.  The math itself is perfectly relevant and can be scaled as needed.

He didn't debunk anything.  He just came in, used vitriolic name-calling to attempt to browbeat the author into admitting he was wrong, and never once addressed the math itself.  When the author addressed Bram's point about target nodes opening new connections as necessary ("The target node cannot form new connections without doing an on-chain transaction, which defeats the whole point: Why not just send an on-chain transaction in the first place, without the LN?") Bram never responded.  Can you respond for him since he did not?
I notice that nobody is using math to show _how_ Mr. Fyookball's math is flawed.  That wouldn't fly in legitimate scientific peer-review, why is it flying here?  If he's wrong, it should be easy to demonstrate.  That's all I'm asking for.  From where I'm sitting, the guy made some good, logical points and everyone's retort here is some variation of "that's stupid".

If most people are using hubs as their primary (or even singular, in many cases I'm sure) connection, you'll inevitably be routed through one eventually.
Sure, you can route around hubs with an ad hoc connection to a recipient, but it requires opening a new connection with said recipient (which requires them to be online, agree to the connection terms, AND to split up their money to accommodate you), an on-chain transaction to open the connection, and another to settle it.  Not exactly user-friendly, which means it's unlikely to be very common.  Furthermore, it would've been faster just to do a direct on-chain transaction for the amount in the first place.

You're not concerned about channel providers (who would have a huge incentive to reach lots of people *and* other businesses) creating too much second-level centralization?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:44:34
I don't think _you_ understand how it works, or else you'd realize that pointing out real limitations of the network is not the same thing as FUD.  You cannot just arbitrarily route around hubs.  The receiver needs to be online, agree to the ad-hoc connection (which means they need to split some of their money off to accommodate you), an on-chain transaction needs to be mined to open the connection, and another has to be mined when you settle.  It's not a user friendly process and I sincerely doubt most people are going to want to do it very much.
Large hubs _will_ happen (they're already forming, clear as day), and they are _unequivocally_ a [potentially potent] form centralization.  If you can't understand why this is a bad thing, then perhaps you should reevaluate your interest in crypto.
Muting responses from you because I'm not interested in speaking to people who aren't willing to think about things objectively.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:22:02
Large quasi-centralized hubs are already starting to form.  It's only going to get worse as connections consolidate into even larger hubs.  People have two options:  
* Try to maintain several of your own connections and hope they work.
* Make a single connection to a large hub that is almost guaranteed to work.
LN is a recipe for centralization because people will _always_ take the path of least resistance.  Large hubs with lots of liquidity effectively negate most of LN's shortcomings, but at the same time they represent the antithesis of what Bitcoin is supposed to be.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:02:23

Sure, but you need to perform an on-chain transaction to establish the connection, and another one to close it.  You cannot "extract" your Bitcoin until the connection is settled, so why wouldn't you just do an on-chain transaction in the first place?  This is the central question that caused Bitcoin to split into BTC and BCH.
Hubs make this process more efficient since you don't need to make a bunch of ad hoc connections to individuals, splitting your money further and further every time you make another new concurrent connection.
To your second point, yes, that's probably exactly what is going to happen.  You'll have large companies whose sole business model is to A.) have lots of money to put into connections to ensure liquidity and B.) make as many connections as possible, all in exchange for an access/processing fee.  That's pretty much what the banks/credit processing companies like Visa do already. 
 It might work well, but it's pretty much the opposite of what Bitcoin should be trying to accomplish.  In fact, the most ironic part about the LN is that the most efficient incarnation of it would be one central hub and everyone "spoking" out from it.  Your transactions would only ever require one hop and would be virtually guaranteed to go through almost instantly.  You could reach literally anyone with zero ad hoc connection opening/closing/settling, no stalled nodes, etc.

And since LN is not user-friendly in any way, shape, or form, what logical conclusion does that lead us to..?


Yeah, because that's _totally_ intuitive and doesn't need any further explaining.  /s
I hate to break it to you, but the average Joe already finds Bitcoin (and crypto in general) to be off-puttingly complicated.  LN simply compounds that.  The narrative that users "won't need to understand any of this" is pretty naive for a multitude of reasons, to be frank.


Reductionist delusions aside, this _is_ a pleasant fiction.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:37:21
Until you factor in the time it took to open the channel, and the time it'll take to settle it (both of which require on chain transactions).  You didn't really save any time vs a direct on-chain transaction.
That said, since you'll presumably be sending lots of repeat transactions to coinbase, it's actually an example of a good use case for LN long term.

Uh, LN is more centralized than BCH will ever be.  Have you even bothered to look at the current node map?  It's already starting.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:16:02
It's a necessary component of scaling, not a solution.  BTC will still need to increase the block size _eventually_ even if LN becomes ubiquitous because it still relies on the main chain to open and settle channels, which will need to be done more often than people seem to think.  Want to extract your BTC out of a channel or out of LN entirely?  Needs an on-chain transaction.  Want to establish a new ad hoc channel to your friend without relying on node hops?  Needs an on-chain transaction.

@_date: 2018-02-01 22:00:09


Yes, and that takes time.  It took time to open the connection and it'll take time to close it.  2 on-chain transactions worth, to be specific.  Since he's only done 2 transactions and doesn't plan to do any more for awhile, he hasn't really _netted_ any saved time versus just doing the transactions on the chain.
Granted, assuming he hasn't closed the connection yet, he'll start netting saved time on the third transaction and beyond.  This is why I noted that any channel that you will be using for frequent repeat payments is a good use case for LN.  Of course, some of his money will be tied up in the connection until he settles it, and he can only ever transfer as much as the connection is valued at through it.  Actually, looking at his edit, it looks like he wasn't even using LN.
Frankly, though, my main problem with LN is that nobody seems willing to admit that it's not perfect.  It has some good use cases, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution like so many claim it is.

Opening a channel still requires an on-chain transaction to be mined.  It'll never technically be free, as the fee could be thought of as being distributed over all of the transactions ever done on the channel.  IE, if it costed $1.00 to open a channel and $1.00 to settle it (eventually), and you did 10 transactions while it was open, each transaction could be thought of as having costed 20 cents each.  Cheaper than 10 on-chain transactions, of course, but not technically free :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:11:30
The premise behind the gambler's fallacy is actually not strictly pertinent here.  At the very least, prior results are a component of the emotions that govern the market.  This is not something that is simple (or perhaps even possible) to quantify, so I can't say just how much of an effect it has, but it's probably a mistake to conflate it with highly randomized data sets, such as coin flips or roulette tables or something to that effect.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:57:19
The more channels you have open, the more your money is split up.  You can't just arbitrarily open a bunch of connections at random.  You have to put your money into them, and you need to have the consent of the receiving party.

Which is exactly what they're going to consolidate into eventually IMO.  Just look at virtually any project undertaken by mankind, ever.
Why would more hubs keep popping up when there's more profit to be had under a consolidated model?  With fewer competitors, access fees are easier to set higher arbitrarily.  Not just anyone can come up with enough capital to create a major hub with sufficient liquidity to compete.  It'll be major players, without any regulation.  This is why I say it's banking 2.0.

It's an interesting technology but it has a long way to go.  Right now, it's not user friendly and often times it's slower than just doing an on-chain transaction if you wish to make a direct, one-time ad hoc payment to someone (perhaps you don't wish to rely on hops or being routed through a semi centralized hub, for example).  Opening and settling connections each require an on-chain transaction.  That's not even getting into some it its other limitations, such as not being able to send funds to someone who doesn't have any.
