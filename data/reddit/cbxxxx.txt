Yeah but I can't help thinking it's his own fault though
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:43:52
Looking forward to the results

Do you have the wallet seed? If so you can just use it to generate a non-2fa wallet
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:10:59
I saw this site but it says that the total trade volume over the last 24 hours is only 27.9 btc... that doesnt seem like a very big market to me, surely there must be a bigger market in aus?
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:30:53
Is there an aus equivalent?

Terrible article. Stop writing about things you don't have a firm knowledge of - you're spreading misinformation
@_date: 2016-03-30 04:12:36
They probably did buy and then wrote this article in the hopes it would drive the price up..

I'm glad to hear that, but unfortunately not everybody is has honest as you are. In fact you're probably in the minority here.

Good on ya!

But it's *already happened* in countries like Greece and Cyprus during the banking crisis a few years ago. I remember a post on reddit from a business owner who had something like 20k eur confiscated (literally taken out) of his business bank accounts. The bank froze a portion of everybody's balance over 200k and started seizing amounts to bail themselves out. I know it sounds like something out of a dystopian novel but it *was* the reality for many people.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:54:43
lol, ironic given the price action in the last 2 hours
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:32:15
Are there any sellers on there you can make a bank transfer to? Or a cash deposit at a branch?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:27:11
I'm pretty sure Bittrex requires a 2fa code before you make a withdrawal, and I'm also pretty sure each 2fa code expires once it's used. So the phisher could get into the account with the 2fa code you give them by they couldn't make any direct withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:57:57
so you wouldn't spend $100 today to protect something that could be worth &gt;$100k in 5 years?
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:43:03
Ok, no need to get defensive. Its not a personal attack on you

What did she always say?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:54:10
Why would they have sent him a picture of it if they didn't know what 'btc' is? I'm pretty sure they recognised what was written on the drive
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:36:09
Yeah you're right, op posted a screenshot of her messages down below and she doesn't know

If you have a wallet.dat file you can just open it with electrum, no need to restore if you know the decryption key or if its not decrypted. But yes, if you have the mnemonic phrase then you can use it to restore the wallet too.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:47:47
Have you contacted them and asked? Lots of listings say that but you have to make the transfer first, if you explain your situation there might be someone willing to trade with you.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:50:44
If you owned a data recovery business and someone came walking in with 4 million dollars on a hard drive, wouldn't you steal the data and it and claim it was unrecoverable? No way I'd trust anyone but myself with that shit
Do people honestly think nobody would steal this? You think all low-paid foot-solder employees have enough integrity not to take advantage of such a situation? 4 Million dollars is a lot of money, most people don't even have the ability to handle such a sum of money properly. Why would you take all these great security measures like not keeping your coins on exchanges, only keeping them in wallets that only you have the keys for etc. and then go ahead and literally HAND OVER the keys to 4 MILLION DOLLARS to someone you've never met before. You're fucking crazy if you'd honestly do that

@_date: 2017-08-18 02:16:15
Sure, not *everybody* is a scumbag, but there are a lot of people who would kill for 4 million dollars. Do you wanna take the chance that the data recovery tech you hand your hard drive to isn't one of those people? If you go around giving strangers the tools to access your coins, or even if you lead on about how many coins own, you're putting yourself and the coins you hold at risk. If you believe otherwise then you're either naive or you're lying to yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:36:14
Good on ya!
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:55:51
What about localbitcoins.com?

Good luck!

Yes, which they will use to login to the account. Then they'll need another code to make a withdrawal. So unless the phishing site is dynamically fetching data from the bittrex session it opens on the users behalf and uses that to trick the user into giving *another* 2fa code, then the withdrawal can't be made. Although the phishing site could claim to the user that an incorrect password was entered and try to trick the user into trying to login again with a second 2fa code
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:13:45
Cause it only spits out the equivalent of about $35usd per transaction
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:45:01

wow you quite literally bought it at the top of the peak didn't you
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:54:42
Not as much as you'd think, if you own bitcoin even today you're still very much an earlier adopter. Cryptocurrency is still very young, imagine what the price would be if it replaced all fiat currency
Edit: people also said what you're saying before it hit $1, $10, $100 and $1000. Maybe you weren't around back then to see it, but your prediction has proven to be wrong many times in the past. $1m is in the timeline, we've already had huge exponential growth and crypto isn't even close to reaching critical mass yet, but we are on our way.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:31:36
That's what people said about 10k not too long ago

You know, how a few miners were mining almost empty blocks to create an artificial backlog of unconfirmed transactions. I forgot what people were calling it

Yeah but with some of the amounts being brought up in this thread you could buy a million bags of tea... No, a whole fucking tea factory and somebody to make it for you for the rest of your life too
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:27:04
Yeah that's what I meant, thanks. Why did the mempool drop suddenly and has been around 2k unconfirmed transactions instead of 20k+? Would you explain what your link says? It looks to me like its saying most of the blocks have been 80-90% full
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:25:09
Good, sleep no!
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:44:53
That's the chart I was looking for! I guess you make a good point that maybe the mempool is lower because if less use, possibly due to the uncertainty of BCC etc. But I find it hard to believe that it would suddenly just drop by so much.. There are still people relying on btc transactions daily and if the blocksize is too small then that would mean more unconfirmed transactions
