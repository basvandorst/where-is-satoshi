Looks like you were the shill

This doesn't make what hodling is any clearer...

GG boys, see you in the afterlife
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:10:52
I agree with everything you said. I didn't have much to behin with but I sold at 15k before it hit 20k
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:50:05
No one has the answer for this?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:52:35
A few days ago some other expert said it was headed for 100k in 2018. This is all speculation.

Well I don't support the monarchy so can I still bang the pig though?
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:04:57
Looks like you were right
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:36:04
What you're saying is so absurd I don't even know where to begin. The supply is overshadowing demand, that is why the price is dipping. Same as with literally anything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:13:46
So you learned there's a thing called 'supply and demand' and then didn't bother to learn what it was?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:30:39
Thanks, but I don't know what this has to do with my comment.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:46:36
Are you genuinely this stupid, or just trolling?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:07:41
Please stop buying the fucking dip

Yeah this is not a new concept. It's death by deflation. When a currency continues to increase in value and is used by people as an investment, people stop using it to buy goods and services. It eventually deflates itself out of existence as a currency. E.g. an orange costs 1 USD and a cow costs 1000 USD. If the value of USD keeps going up, people will just start hoarding USD and using 1000 oranges to buy cows and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:47:28
No. That's not what I'm saying.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:32:01
The fuck has this cat got to be happy about?

Don't worry the money launderers will still find a use for it
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:44:07
Well you take the shitty $45 printer and you set it on fire until it dies.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:17:08
You've missed the point of my comment. Sorry, but this is just wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:23:08
"buy the dip!!!"
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:56:48
Again, you've missed the point. The use of oranges and cows is for illustrative purposes only. I have read comments like yours in the past and I'm not going to engage because it's pointless. Good luck with your investments.

Where can I find a butterfly exchange?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:37:41
Man, you are retarded. Do you understand how supply and demand works at all? If not enough people are buying at the current price but more people are wanting to sell, the price will continue to go down.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:05:01
But by logic isn't the same true for those guys telling people to buy the dip? Or hodl?
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:59:50
Yeah fuck these guys

What is FUD?
