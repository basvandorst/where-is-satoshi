Gold is used in jewelry design, it is classified as a precious metal for its ornamental value. Bitcoin only exists in the virtual world.

What about the downsides? If the value is based exclusively on mass adoption, then no matter how pervasive it becomes, it can never ever have any real value. It will always be volatile and never achieve stability. 


A clear case of begging the question fallacy. Yes, assets are considered store of value in IRL, but Bitcoin's status as an asset is based on speculation. Real assets like coal, land, metal, etc are not speculative.

I am not deflecting. Whatever value Bitcoin has is based on speculation. By this logic, scrap metal can be more valuable than gold if everyone starts to buy it. The point is gold, diamond or platinum has usage IRL unlike Bitcoin whose very existence is speculative and virtual. 


Timelines are irrelevant. 1 Bitcoin may cost $1 million tomorrow and a dime the day after tomorrow. Its value is artificial, not natural.

I never said non-tangible assets cannot have value. Anything can have value if a group of people start buying it. but you cannot compare it with something that has value beyond speculation. That's the whole point of this debate. I bothered to comment here because someone on this thread compared bitcoin to gold, you can look it up.

It was just an analogy, don't take it in the literal sense. I agree that bitcoin is used in online purchases but that makes it a currency which doesn't have any intrinsic value. Hoarding a unit of currency makes little sense as its value will always remain the same. A 5 dollars bill will always be 5 dollars bill. Bitcoin's price however changes with time, so people buy and hoard it. Bitcoin's nature is shadowy. It's neither fully a currency nor fully an asset. You cannot compare it with gold or any precious metal.

Okay so now you jumped from gold to fiat. Once again, it was besides the point as I never compared bitcoin to fiat. 


The question is why people decide something is valuable. Why is diamond considered more valuable than wood? Once you understand that, you realize the difference between value and intrinsic value. Bitcoin may have value, but it can never have any intrinsic value.

That's beside the point. What if tomorrow everyone starts valuing human excreta? Sure it will attract buyers and sellers, but the question remains. Will it have any real usage?
