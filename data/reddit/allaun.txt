Leaving digital proof that they are attempting to circumvent currency control. Not to mention PayPal might ban you.

"There aren't many options, but Bitcoin is the obvious alternative."
I'd argue otherwise. If they want your stuff, they're going to take it. It's arguably easier since Bitcoin isn't considered currency. So it would fall under asset forfeiture laws.

original question posed whether or not Bitcoin was hygienic or not, I was pointing out that physical dollar bills are becoming more rare but still have use. in the same way bitcoin offline has uses. if you want more common occurrence, Bitcoin on USB sticks being sold on eBay

But people do anyway. People are strongly encouraged to pay with their debit cards, NFC enabled phones, etc. But they still use paper money. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:47:50
This is actually a really interesting question. If you are referring to when you use the physical option for bitcoin, I'd argue no. Not really. Paper is paper. And as far as I know, the typical paper a American household uses isn't anti-microbial. If you're using a casascius coin, this brings a REALLY interesting problem.  Since they are typically traded on ebay, you are introducing microbe transmission on a global scale. And as it has been shown, any medium capable of harboring microbes increases transmission risk. I know, same can be said about money, food, beanie babies, Wacky inflatable tube men. But the question was if bitcoin is more hygienic. The electronic side of bitcoin is hygienic yes. But so are the numbers you use in your bank account.

That's kind of how a majority works. If you want to be part of a mass decision network, you have to accept the majority decisions. Otherwise, it's not majority rule.

Good in theory, but like all systems organized by humans, not implemented in practice. In the same way 100% socialist systems are impossible to achieve, 100% democratic systems are also impossible to implement. Humans have always and will always gravitate towards a hierarchy because of the way our brains are wired. 
I understand that bitcoin is designed to combat some of the worst excesses that can generate, but it is still designed to be human interact-able. Which means that it's open to human power structures. Which translates into basic tribal affiliations and political power networks. 
We have always and will always seek out a leaders because we are social animals. A good example is the Linux kernel. Linus Torvalds isn't the sole contributor to the Linux kernel, but he is the face everyone associates with it. 
Lesser known leaders are mentioned, but by default, he is the one that the group has designated the most influential. 
In theory, the linux kernel is meant to be based on a model where anyone can contribute. In reality, a group was designated to control where it goes. And the same applies here. In theory, 100% headless, in practice, leaders are elected and factions appear.
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:15:51
I'm arguing that sentiment is basically untenable. It's basic assumption is flawed. You can't have a disorganized system AND a functional system. You need leaders, which leads to factions, which leads to power blocks. Which leads to defaulting to leaders of the group, (edit:used the term strange attractors incorrectly)then cults of personality. Then the system is either replaced, becomes dysfunctional but stable or it dies. It's a flaw inherently woven into the species. We will always give up security and safety for stability. It's easier to form power blocks. It takes to much energy to read every update, research the issue and form an opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-18 01:43:31
I could see that happening, it's one of the more stablish configurations you see in large groups.

I've been following bitcon for years now. The reason I don't invest? I can't afford it. I literally can't afford the price swings. 1 USD loss is a loss too far.

That is when the truly scary shit happens. Resource hoarding, increased violence, bottoming out of low paying jobs. And since the wheels on this bus are global, you get the added benefit of the freezing of our Just in Time delivery system. Think los Angeles and New Orleans on a trans continental scale.

Because this debate is interesting, let's assume that this goverment we're talking about mandates that all devices include a firmware checking chip. Not too far from possible. They could mandate that all sha-256 hashing algorithms are banned. Of course, you could switch to the alternative currencies, but for all intents and purposes bitcoin would be dead. You could try to smuggle in unmodified hardware or find a rouge fpga vendor. But for normal people, it would be dead.

I was disagreeing that telling the truth will ALWAYS get you in trouble. What the guy did is basicly tell everyone within hearing distance, HEY! Look at me, I'm selling drugs! LISTEN TO ME! I'm SELLING DRUGS! He was acting like the navi fairy of the online drug business. Of course the guy was going to get arrested.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:23:21
As I stated before, not really. If a governmental entity were truly interested, they wouldn't even need to look for the protocol itself. Just the patterns of activity. Not to mention that bitcoin isn't truly anonymous. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:20:32
Hardware being installed at [tier 1]( installations that filter the protocol for that region.

I like alt currencies. I really do. But NOTHING ever changes with human nature. Not unless you are physically altering neurochemistry. The fundamental problem with those countries isn't with the fiat currency. It's with their leadership and / or their enforcement of corruption prevention.

you could try logging onto freenode (irc.freenode.org) and asking in  Freenode is a IRC server. (Internet Relay Chat) A free irc client is [HexChat]( a fork of Xchat for windows. Which is open source. They usually encourage sellers to register with the channel so you can see sellers ratings.

Technically not true, they could do deep packet inspection. Then filter and/or traffic shape any activity related to bitcoin. If you REALLY wanted to mess with people. Same goes with encrypting the protocol. You only need to look at packet sizes and traffic patterns to get a good guess what someone is doing.

My point is that someone was claiming telling the truth = jail. I was attempting to point out they didn't arrest him simply because they THOUGHT he MIGHT be doing something. They collected various forms of evidence that changed his statement of "theory" into a statement of fact.
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:05:10


























It wasn't only those statements. It was compounded by accounts linking him to the activity, The questions about how to conduct said activity.

That was my point. If I made the active decision to reside in Canada, I'd have to follow the rules there. He chose to continue to live in the United States, while being aware his activity would most likely result in a massive amount of prison time.

And of course, this government could look for power draw fluctuations consistent with mining.  If you tried to buy solar panels, they could track that purchase. And if you say you could buy it with bitcoins, they would no doubt be aware of the dealer. This is fun! :D And the paper answer wouldn't generate a blockchain to verify your work.

No, he admitted to activity that was deemed illegal in his host country. Not the same. Water is wet. We are on a planet. Food is used to feed me. These are statements of factual truth. But they won't get me arrested.

Because bitcoin is designed to be divisible to 8 places. Banning anything less than .1 would defeat the purpose.

Ok, there is a point where you have to be reasonable. The following statement would be be JUST CAUSE to investigate and use the information provided. Hypothetically, If I were to steal this blue car and strip it's parts, I could make money. How could I do that, "Hypothetically"? Also, look at these keys I happen to have. And these lock picking books. OH MY! Look at that, a blue car that happens to be locked! I know this isn't EXACTLY what happened, but it's pretty close. He made statements as a hypothetical but it was with a wink and nod. You'd have to be a really naive person not to notice it.
