@_date: 2014-01-12 10:46:06
No, the bill is not that high. At current rate, it 43 BTC. 
And why you are talking like 600btc will crash the market ?

I have the M coin, the hitman want to kill me. I put my coin in the jar. 
You have the P coin, you put it in the jar too.  
Other people put more coins.
Somebody shakes the jar, i end receiving a R coin while you receive the M coin. Now you are the mark for the hitman.
get it ?

You are making no sense! What about the people who have thousands and are millionaires now. It not like they injected the millions themselves.

If you are obsessed with something , take a break from it. Think with a clear mind before you enter.
I was obsessed with cars, i bought all magazines, lot of tuning gears. In 2011, it nearly cost me my life with a car accident. 
You should work at/with something you love, so if you see your future with bitcoin, go for it, but always keep one feet in solid ground just in case something happen.
