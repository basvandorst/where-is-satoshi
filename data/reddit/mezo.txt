Because they're all tied to BTC. If Bitcoin gets sick, so does everything else. You must be new if you're not aware of that.

Straya cunt. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:50:25
Great. When will it be available to the average user?
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:51:06
Nothing. You started in January 2018...

Geez, talk about cliche title.

They're different. Bitcoin cash is actually called bcash now :)

It was rising where he bought.

Bitcoin doing a good enough job of seizing your money on its own, at the moment.

Buy more, then sell when it dips again
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:39:19
Not panic sell?

If I had a Bitcoin for every time I've heard that over the last week...

So...$5.9k was a pretty common buy trigger
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:44:20
Yep, selling to buy back in lower sounds like a great strategy...until it stops going lower and runs away in the other direction.

I'm getting btc price notifications from Blockfolio. I switched to Delta over a month ago.

Lol u cant call it based on 1m charts. There was a red candle half the size straight after 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:01:14
Minus $8k. I think we'll all owe Bitcoin money after this. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:48:21
What is the typical 24h volume on gdax? 82k seems awfully high, but I dont usually watch it as religiously as the last few days.
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:27:12
Yawn...heard it all before.

If we start going down again, can't you just move the red line across a bit and make a case that we've been in a bear market the whole time?
