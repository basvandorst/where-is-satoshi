Be extremely careful with foreign bank accounts- you have to [declare them annually to the IRS]( You may want to talk to a lawyer or accountant to set up some sort of S-Corp or LLC in another jurisdiction (or whatever they recommend). 
Last thing you want is to wake up one morning to IRS agents at the door and all your overseas bank accounts frozen.

.jar files are dangerous anyway. If it's a legit attachment it will end with .scr
EDIT: this is a bad joke- never open ANY attachment from anywhere (unless you requested it be sent to you). Also, NEVER click a link in an email. If you need to find something online referenced in the email, find it yourself via a search engine or type in the URL. Assume everything is a phish attempt, and you'll be much safer in the long run.

Your Father in Law maybe fits the profile of people who get their identity stolen by bitcoin thieves and scammers (established baby boomers).

Cryptonomicon reminds me of bitcoin, too, with all the Chinese investors in the anonymous digital currency, and all the encryption stuff.
