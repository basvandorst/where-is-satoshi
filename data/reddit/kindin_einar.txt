Yep, unfortunately there isn't really much you can do about inflation in such a small economy. People have suggested that we start using some other country's money, but most people are sentimentally attached to the króna. It's something like 300 bucks, so it's a nice christmas bonus at least, but it was privatization that got us in this mess in the first place, so I'm not happy about this.

Yeah, it's not happening. This is some weird proposal that got picked up by some fringe media site and is not going through.
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:19:56
Ok, I did a little research, and apparently this is some weird thing that one minister proposed back in October that isn't ever going to happen. But at least it doesn't look like we're privatizing the banks, so yay for that.

Wat? The government is taking ownership? From the people? Seems strange. Knowing Iceland, something fucky has been going on. I'll do some research.

A lot of Icelanders believe this is all a result of the bank privatization of 2002, when Davíð Oddson's government sold the national banks to their buddies and sometimes family members. These bankers are the ones who would go on to ruin the economy with all sorts of fantastically illegal business practices while the government cheered them on. Many of them are the bankers we arrested that are mentioned in the article.
Now we're privatizing them again, and it's doubtful they'll do it any better this time.

That's pretty much normal for it, it's been that way for years.

It would. The Norwegians would probably have to be idiots to allow it though.

We were never put on a terrorist watch list, Britain seized our assets using anti-terror laws, essentially calling us a terrorist organization. I'm quite familiar with the pirates yes, they're one of the biggest political parties in the country.
And which claim do you mean, that they're no longer defrauding us, or that the proposal isn't going through?

I have that guy tagged as "Either Bill Gates or Elvis". I wonder why.

That was an emergency measure after the financial collapse, it's almost certainly stopping soon.
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:13:09
They defrauded us *until* 2008. However, it doesn't look like this is actually a thing that is happening. It was proposed by some minister back in October and got picked up by some small news site, but it's not going through.

Bah, we didn't get the government for treason, we only did half of what we should have.

He just said he'd be willing to force you at gunpoint(make illegal) to not send unvaccinated children to school. He was not vague about it in any way. Yes, people should have freedoms, but only to the point when they start depriving others of their freedoms. Simply put, society has the right to protect itself from you, whether you want to be part of it or not.

Is anyone else bothered whenever someone uses the biohazard symbol for something that isn't a biohazard? They should ideally be using an exclamation point in a triangle.

I did not grow up on "insanity island" I have had plenty of teachers and have yet to meet a seriously fucked up one. A couple minor fuck-ups but nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe it's regional?

Or Hawains learning more about Hawaii than other states learn about Hawaii? Education tends to focus on the region you're in. Ohians learn things about Ohio that people from other states don't for instance.
