I help a friend build a deck. He cooks me some burgers and offered me beer.  I agree my time was worth something he had. Did not need a bank for the transaction.  I simplify this to make the point that we still see ourselves needing the bank. We don’t.  We just need a trustless currency that lets me do that same deal with my friend when he is 1000 miles away.

The above is a good dialog in the usefulness of a medium of exchange.  Does nothing to support it being backed by a government or being legal tender. Certainly does not address how such legally backed tender steals from the people regularly in the form of devaluation of their purchasing power.  And if you believe the owners want you to escape poverty then your eyes are truly shut.

When this guy says something, many times its best to do the oposite.  I dont know his batting average today, but back in the day when I used to have CNBC on I would use this guy to signal a top/bottom.

I use them and things have worked out fine.
I then bought them back though :-). I was just testing the process.

Bought a Speedotron lighting system for 2500 Canadian in bitcoin last week. So it’s being used. I of course replaced the btc. 
Why did I use bitcoin because would have taken 3 days to get the money out of the bank machine with 1000 per day limit. Or I could take my time and go into the bank.  Or I could raise my daily limit then take the money then lower it. 
God I’m tired typing it.  Bitcoin is just scan his qr code and done. 
Give it time.

Well IMO if BTC fails then the rest go with it and we will be stuck with the BANKS crypto.
Crypto is here to stay, its just wether you want one that provides you some degree of freedom.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:09:54
But how many of those demand the proof of work (ie ENERGY) to guarantee the ledger?
Also, the infrastructure that has been put in place for BTC if it fails then its doubtful that same level of dedication will be put to the Alt Coin.
And right now, most of those alts need things like BTC to move in and out.
Then there is the moral of the people.  If BTC fails then it will all but guarantee the masses stick to the government regulated cryptos.

When I see people talking garbage like this, and yes garbage because the information they give is entirely useless and with the spread offered a half dead monkey could make that guess... Yea he could be right but it won't have anything to do with his intellect or knowledge and thats what makes this opinion a wast of time reading ...
So why would a person make these kinds or remarks?  I can only think of two reasons.
1. Stupid
2. They just want a pulpit and attention

True.  In my comments above I should have said been programming 25+ years.  And mainly in Windows because of my job but this is starting to include a lot of iOS now also.
Yes, the hardware itself is better IMO.  I enjoy being on the MAC/OSX side, but use Fusion for the Win side.  Best/worst of both worlds I guess.
That said do a lot of photography, and way way prefer the OSX side and Hardware.
Not much beats a nice piece of glass in the apple machines.

Maybe I don't want to ever exchange my BTC back to CAD$. Me thinks the cats out of the bag and the harder they try the more credibility BTC will get.
Also, if the rest of the world decides not to play along, then we as Canadians will slip further behind.  I think Germany said that you can pay taxes with BTC now.  They are a large EU country, maybe the only one that *might* be remotely solvent ... if they ever get their gold LOL.
Im reminded of the D/L of music and videos ... hows that been going ... all stopped now.
Stopping BTC will be much harder.

For what its worth I sent the feedback.  Said I do not care if they wish to accept BTC now or not, but I want the ability to use it with other suppliers I deal with. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 23:19:30
BETA was better than VHS too, but did not survive.
Its not always about best, but more about adoption, and BTC seems to have now been adopted.  
Some say that VHS succeeded once the porn industry adopted it.  This is why it was quite interesting to see them starting to come onboard with BTC
Also BTC hardware is being rolled out, and accepted ... so barrier to entry at the BTC to Country$ portals will cost.  
I think the main wanner is now chosen ... and we are going to be going through the ramp up at this point.

UM, incase he did not notice.  We DO already have many global cryptos and one is already Bitcoin.

My only issues with buying a miner that has to be delivered is ... 
1. WHEN DO I GET IT.
2. Electricity
3. Maintanence (they do break, and not mining while you wait for repair)
4. I don't care how you calculate how much you will make .. the difficulty is rising faster than you can keep up.
Im not saying that cloud mining is great, but, It solves my first 3 issues ... and I can sell the Hashing (for whatever its worth ).
Yes, it does cost more per gnash

Reading that stuff getting old now.
Risky ... Risky for who LOL.
I thought the mantra of the banking people was that you need to take a measured amount of risk to get reward. So thats what Im doing ...  They don't like this idea now? 
Or only provided that Im taking the risk with them LOL.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:29:48
Nope. I'm waiting for it to bottom.  Don't mind missing the absolute bottom either.  Want some stability before buying more.  It's more the stability than the price.  
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:16:36
Thanks for this information.  I have been debating this for some time, and the part that keeps me from purchasing is that their site must be up and running.  It's not decentralized as you say.  It's not how this technology should work.
I guess I better just start reading up more on paper wallets.
There is that other device the ledger or something like that.  Not as fancy and no screen but if it does not rely on some website being up then it may be the better option.

I have donated to Wikipedia several times (using BTC)
Each time I emailed and asked why they promote PayPal upfront but hide BTC option.  Each year Im told they looking into it.
This year the asking for donations arrived as usual.  I emailed again and said that their entire approach to information is based on being open, and verified by the many .. not a closed system. As such they should be promoting BTC.
Again a response that they will take under consideration.
About 2 weeks later another email asking for me to donate again this year.  I responded with their letter to me this year about considering my request to show the BTC option on the main donation page.
I said that I dont know why they are so hell bent on promoting PayPal, but I too am "considering" donating.
Like them Im just sot sure when Im going to act on it.
As I always say.  Vote with your wallet.

Im a bit torn if this is good or bad.  I also have gold and silver but switched to BTC at $30.
I was talking to my so about this tonight.  While they were able to suppress the price of gold/silver with naked shorts ... gold and silver (as far as currency) lacked utility.
By this I mean, its near impossible for me to send a 1oz silver coin to someone 1/2 way around the world to pay for something.  And it won't be instant. And there is no immutable ledger ....  
Another thing I wonder about is that with BTC people already know they can have their own wallets.  Im sure many would like to actually have the BTC themselves, and will require them if wanting to transact, or send to friends or buy things in other countries.
Im sure they would like to manipulate BTC, and may try.  However Im also wondering if they won't be able to manipulate to the degree they did gold/silver.  
This also presumes the US$ maintains its demand.  If us$ was to slip then people will not want to be settled in Zimbabwe dollars so to speak.
Its going to get interesting..
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:17:14
I would not be worried about it.  I switched to Bread for iOS a few weeks ago.  I noticed the same thing.  I sold BTC (and replaced :-) ) to a friend also on BREAD iOS, and another on Android.
Transaction took over 4 Days to 100% confirm.  I went for the low fee option as well.
The first time is scary but it all works out.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:32:48

Slightly off topic but these are not stupid guys.  I’m rolling back to interviews with JP as well.  So when I see them going on record negatively to bitcoin, something that’s so early in is acceptance, then they are doing it out of fear.

@_date: 2017-11-16 13:39:32
Was actually thinking about it this year.
Also, my 19yo got me to get him 1000 BTC.  Last night he said he and friend were going to buy like 100/week.  He was wondering best way to store them and I though a Trezor might make a nice little gift also.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:45:41
Was fun to watch the drop and then back up.

This is not bad advise, but the only thing that troubles me with Land/House (I do own them though) Is that people dont realize that both are subject to TAX and defence.
Taxes can be made to be so bad that your forced to sell, and most times that means others around you because the property values are dropping.   Just something to keep in mind.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:54:52
Ok, So Im not technically buying BTC - Ah lol.
Also, you should explain to some here how margin calls work!   :-)

One can not know the future .. and worse yet tell someone else what they "think" even if they believe it.  :-)
Is there room, many metrics say yes ...  so the possibilities are there.  Will it happen who knows. "I think yes, but Im biased"
Converting back to Fiat ..thats interesting ... I did not get into it to convert back, but if I needed some Canadian dollars to pay for something in the future, or pay a bill/debt I would do it.
BTC is still a currency ... like any other currency ... so I look at currencies as "purchasing power".  Converting it from a currency to a tangible asset/service is one of its purposes ... What makes BTC a good currency is that its limited to the 21million.  Because of this it has a attribute like gold.  Limited supply.
So if someday down the road people continue to like BTC then I more than likely would not convert, but use it as an accepted store of value/purchasing power.
These things difficult to predict, so I just let ride day-to-day ..
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:28:13

@_date: 2017-10-08 17:59:04
Im an early adopter.  Very early, Days of 30$. 
During this time if I spent BTC, or sold some to a friend I replaced it that day (most times).
The only time I waiting 5 days was when I sold a BTC to go to South Beach in March, had the money go to my bank account, then returning from the trip repurchased.  I did this to ** KONW ** that I could do a round trip on the currency.
Apart from this, almost every month a purchase a few more.  I buy in Canadian, and have bought at near $6200 CAD.  Of course I get way less BTC now, but I enjoy being a part of the change.  I like the potential in the future of where this could go.
So YES YES YES, Im torn ... love seeing it go up, yet at times I just wish I had my cash flow earlier to buy more. :-)
