bitcointalk had problems before (502 bad gateway error) and since yesterday it has gotten worse. and today `unable to connect to the database` error

proving you are someone (the owner of a bitcoin address) is much easier than you think. you sign a message with time stamp and post it for **public** to see.  
and since Craig Wright failed to do this, his claim is as good as anybody else who claims to be Satoshi or were supposed to be Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:30:50
you can assume that some of those transactions are the owner himself sending to that address to fake some interest in the giveaway but 781 can't be all himself!

Hard to tell. I thought they've fixed it with the last commit but it seems like they are still working on a fix. It shouldn't be weeks though!
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:21:29
It is a known parsing/deserialization bug.
You have to wait for the new release.

Thank you Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:15:46
Yup. They are the same size with `BITCOIN:`
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:28:20
Hmm, very interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:40:12


Are you sure? Cause I get bigger result for bech32 than I got with base58 with `bitcoin:` prefix
Note that this is my own code and I counted the columns by hand so there may be mistakes ;)
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:32:29
I like this idea.

There certainly is both advantages and disadvantages in having only one implementation and having more than one. The real question is "Do advantages of one approach outweigh the disadvantages?"

`Bitcoin addresses != people` so you may want to rethink your subject.
and also 


What does this even mean, the word "account" has no meaning with bitcoin.

Just use a wallet that allows you some coin control. For example in Electrum you can select the outputs you want to spend from the coins tab. Easily ignore all the 1 sat UTXOs and spend the rest.
There is no reason to move.
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:18:57
Obviously, Yes.
Specially if there is a dip like what happened with the finex hack and the big drop ;)
@_date: 2016-11-02 12:22:36
Nothing, I just mean no matter what material you choose as long as it is a thin plate it would be easy to stamp it with a hammer and a letter thingy :)

If those wallets don't have that feature but allow you to sign an unsigned raw tx then make the (unsigned) transaction with other tools available and then sign and broadcast it with those wallets.
@_date: 2016-12-02 07:52:38
Think of it this way: the 92 GB blockchain would have been 4.6 GB smaller.
Besides this is just an idea that I came up with when reading the developers guide, and as the experts said it was already suggested in a better way which results in a roughly 20% reduction.
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:12:25
How much did it cost you to build this device?
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:03:10
Well, since I am beginning to understand how bitcoin works first I wanted to make sure I am not making an obvious mistake because of not knowing about some basic thing about transactions. I also wasn't sure if I should make an issue or something else on GitHub.
And apparently there are [similar but better ideas]( already available. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:17:34
# Pro
Being able to have up to 100 more transactions in each block
# Con
Possibly not be backward compatible. (and remember that I am not an expert)

Me checking price:
    while(true)
    {
        GetPrice(Api.Bitfinex);
    }

Thanks for the update!
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:22:53
I believe 150 s/b is the default amount which is hard-coded. Electrum gets the appropriate fee from servers it connects to, so change your server to see if it changes.
I am connected to node.xbt.eu (random server) and the wallet suggests 0.001367 BTC/KB for ~5 blocks (0.0024 for next block) which is correct suggestion.
Also check the two option about fee from `Tools &gt; Preference &gt; Fees tab`

if i am not mistaken satoshi's account on bitcointalk was banned a long time ago when he disappeared to prevent this sort of things.

Go for stainless steel and you will be fine. There is a good balance between cost and corrosion resistance. 
Besides with a plate of say 10-5mm you don't have to worry about stamping.

Using a library is always going to make things easy!
And IMO it is not really "blockchain education" if you are simply calling methods like `privateKey.toPublicKey().toString()`. What goes on in that method is the important part.

i really love this project and i hope it is successful and also can bring lots more attention to bitcoin.

Then it is not "miner fee" it is "service specific fee" in other words It is bitstamp that is taking a lot of fee from you for withdrawal. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 17:37:34


It will only check the outgoing not incoming. In other words only the owner of that address can send transactions, hence updating the webpage torrent hash.
**Edit** Looking at the code, I may be wrong since it doesn't really check to see if the sender is `1DhDy....` address or not!

Do you want to receive BCC?
NO =&gt; Then you are safe. Continue living life.
Yes =&gt; Your BTC is still safe, you may need to take additional steps to safely acquire BCC
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:17:24
You don't pay fee based on how much you are transferring (not based on amount), instead you pay fee based on size of the transaction in bytes.
If you are using a proper wallet and it gave you the suggested amount of fee then that means your transaction size was about 3300 bytes.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:51:12
No. Read the topic for correct reason.
It was simply an invalid block.

You can't claim something is bad by nature just because some people don't use it correctly.
A couple of weeks ago I read someone throw his hardware wallet in coffee or something and ruined it. Can you make the conclusion that hardware wallets should not be used then?
