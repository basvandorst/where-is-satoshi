Why not ban technology and privacy altogether and let's ask everyone to provide their fingerprints if they want to use the Internet? That will be easy to understand and much more effective.

I recall about the Payment Protocol and someone saying that SSL was broken but at least it was better than nothing. I don't see anything in the Trezor device or in myTrezor.com about that, so I guess it's not using it.

I'm doing this for a friend. I don't like replicas, but many people do, I guess men do it to fuck with better chicks and woman to piss off their competitors.  It was a surprise to see they accepted btc and giving some discount for it.

Fyi I'm not related at all with that site, and know nothing about the quality and service. I did not buy there yet, so do your own research ;) I liked the site and the option to pay with btc for a 20% discount.

presented by the distributed ledger technology underlying virtual currencies. The electronic
distribution of digital cash offers potential efficiencies and, unlike physical cash, it brings
with it a ledger of transactions that is absent from physical cash. This proposal takes due
account of these advantages and acknowledges the fact that virtual currencies have
highlighted innovative ways for governments to reduce fraud, corruption, error and the cost of
paper-intensive processes. Similarly, the proposed measure is mindful of the fact that the
virtual currency market has the potential to set in place new, modern ways in which
governments and citizens interact, in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust, and can
provide novel insights into establishing ownership and provenance for goods and intellectual
While they try to control exchanges (something they already do, so nothing new to worry about here) this paragraph means they are starting to grasp some of the benefits of bitcoin as a technology to leverage other transparent financial ledgers.

Everytime someone writes a title like "Bitcoin is booming in..." Iceland/Cyprus/Greece/Africa/Ukranie/Argentina/Venezuela/Japan/ etc. I know he knows nothing about bitcoin. Lol

The context in which this "hack" was made makes this option a real one, an inside job from someone who perfectly knew the weak links in such a complex system, besides how not to trigger the security alerts.
It could also be another exchange employee (or BitGo) as some other exchanges had the same security measures in place.

Don't think it's targeting bitcoin, but a few gov institutions, as the malware was customized for each one of those targets to avoid detection. It was designed to get all types of privatekeys among other things. Looks like airgaped systems like the ones supporting Armory could be at risk if this malware is replicated on the wild, but nor sure about Trezor. As you say Trezor does not work as an standard USB, but this malware is not using standard USB filesystem either.

Never use bitcoin from your computer. Use your mobile or hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:01:24
Trezor is a cold hardware wallet, a device to keep your keys always offline. Mycelium is a hot wallet for Android that can also manage Trezor generated addresses in case you also want to spend from the addresses in your Trezor. You don't need to have another phone :) the idea is to carry your pocket money with you if you are going to spend bitcoins on the go.
Read the docs in their websites. 
CB can be hacked, sized, destroyed, bankrupt, etc. just like any other exchange.
Change your 2FA. Use Authy or Authenticator plus. They all work with  CB and all other places. GA doesn't do backups, very risky. Don't delete GA until you have Authy fully working.
Read the links in the sidebar of this sub. But be careful when testing, now its expensive to send bitcoins. It may be a good idea to keep your bitcoins in CB until Lightning Network starts getting some traction.

They can try to illegalize (what?) but they can't shut down lifeboats when everybody knows the Titanic global debt is going to crash again.  That is not going to work, it will just create a huge new ilegal industry transacting with numbers on the Internet. If they can't stop drugs, which are physical goods, imagine what a success will be baning crypto. They will just accelerate the total anonymization of all cryptos. Also cryptos can mutate to avoid legal definitions, so lawmakers will have to end up illegalizing GPUs?, ASICs?, CPUs? Internet? Numbers? Barter? Coupons? Prepaid cards? Debt? Commerce? If I sell you a car and you give me some fiat money along with some numbers, what is the police going to stop there? Of course they can shut down exchanges, but that is not the same as shutting down cryptos. Without exchanges we will have to use our bitcoins, or moneros in a new inevitable P2P economy, and the police already has a lot of work going after the bad guys.

Good question, but there's no real answer for it. Bitcoin is really difficult to understand.
Your question states that there is an effective procedure that, given n ≥ 1 and exponential polynomials in n variables with integer coefficients f1,..., fn, g, produces an integer η ≥ 1 that depends on n, f1,..., fn, g, and such there is no solution.

Fees are related to the transaction message size in bytes not to how many btc you are sending. It all depends mostly on how many coins you need to include in the transaction (inputs) and how many new coins you create in that transaction (outputs). With one input and one output sending 5000 btc would need the same fee as sending 0.001 btc. 
Edit: if you pay 1 cent or not fee your transaction will never be confirmed and you will have to wait a couple of days until it gets dropped from the nodes mempools.

Just like gold. What's the real value of gold?. Someone told me gold is tangible and bitcoin imaginary, but the Bitcoin protocol, the network, the mining difficulty and the data in the blockchain are also tangible. Do you think the Internet is tangible? Does it have value?. bitcoin --the accounting unit-- grabs its value from consensus, just like gold, on how valuable is its scarcity, accountability,  immutability, transportability, storaging, verificability, and some other properties that make them useful to become the best store of value.

Hard to understand, but this no-head structure is precisely  what makes Bitcoin strong and different from any other coin. It's called decentralization.

ULTRA EASY BITCOIN SECURITY
1) Wallets: Buy a Trezor to hold (&gt;$1000) and  Mycelium with a non rooted Android (pocket money). Don't do desktop. Learn how to use a Trezor and practice. Backup the mnemonics in different locations never put those words on digital.
2) Exchanges: Use one with more than 4 years and never hacked (Gemini, Kraken, Coinbase,...) Don't speculate, just buy and transfer to your Trezor asap. Activate 2FA for withdraws (use Authenticator Plus).
3) Transfers: always doble check the sending address by other means (other than desktop)
4) Learning: test before with small quantities until you are confident.
5) Use "Google inactive account" to disclose mnemonic locations in case you die.

Excuse my non native english. Think of it as digital gold. The value of gold does not come from its industrial demand but from many centuries of people trusting it as a good system to store value. Bitcoin vs Gold: Which is a Better Long-Term Bet? 
The dollar has lost most of its value since I was born, its monetary policy is decided by a few. Bitcoin monetary policy is open source, transparent, secure and predictable. If you use Bitcoin and not other crypto or fiat coin, you agree on its rules, but you are not forced on them, you opt-in. Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, not politics. If you find a better coin or 
system at doing what you want, you can sell your bitcoins and buy the new one.

My point is that no matter how many altcoins exist, the value of Bitcoin is not affected at all because btc's value depends on its own scarcity.

Sorry to say this, but you denote a total misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is. You should educate yourself before you talk about it. You missed the whole thing: it's digital, it's a perfect abstraction, no tangible product that can be destroyed, replicated, falsified or printed. No god can create more without the approval of all users. We already have hundreds of copies, some of them may have better tech, but their value is settled by the markets and how many users adopt each one, so the network effect outperforms a temporal tech advantage. Please go to  there you will find some interesting material if you have an open mind.

Big banks push back on launch of bitcoin futuresUS regulators told financial system ill-prepared for dealing with cryptocurrencies
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to start listing bitcoin futures with a centralised clearing mechanism
The world’s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared.
On Wednesday, the price of bitcoin climbed to a fresh record high of more than $12,000. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market.
However the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Groupand CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry.
The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday.
In a draft seen by the FT, the FIA writes that the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures “did not allow for proper public transparency and input”.
The CME and CBOE agreed to operate under a self-certified regime for their upcoming contracts, meaning regulators had minimal time to review them formally.
Using it for “these novel products does not align with the potential risks that underlie their trading and should be reviewed”, the draft reads.
The CFTC warned last week during its approval process that the emerging cryptocurrency markets were largely unregulated and the agency had “limited statutory authority”.
“It is also our understanding that not all risk committees of the relevant exchanges were consulted before the certification to launch these products,” the letter added.
Futures brokers are worried they will bear the brunt of the risk associated with bitcoin futures, because the margin that backstops the contract is placed in a clearing house.
Clearing houses stand between two parties in a trade, managing the risk to the rest of the market if one side should default. They are mutually funded in part by banks to guard against the failure of their largest members.
Several brokers, among the top 10 largest providers, have privately confirmed to the Financial Times that they will not clear the products immediately.
CBOE said its futures exchange did not have a risk committee, but it consulted with its board and regulatory oversight committee. The OCC, its clearing house, also has a risk committee that reviewed the product.
In its filing, CME said it had discussed the specifications of the contracts with customers for around six months. It did not have an immediate comment on Wednesday.

One clearing broker said that it would be open-minded about cryptocurrencies, as it was a US dollar product, but only if they were “properly controlled and regulated”. However he added: “We’d still be on the hook in a worst-case scenario as we are exposed as members of the clearing house.”
Other exchanges are showing interest in bitcoin futures but are more cautious. Thomas Book, chief executive of Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Exchange, said timing was crucial in launching a new derivatives contract.
“We still do see challenges that have to be tackled in close discussion with our clients. It is important for an exchange to follow a sustainable approach on this asset class well co-ordinated with the market.”
Thomas Peterffy, a pioneer of electronic trading and head of Interactive Brokers, has warned that the introduction of bitcoin futures into a clearing house could increase systemic risk.

How can anyone call 'bubble' if they don't know it's real value? If value is given by trust, users, network and usefulness I think bitcoin is very very undervalued.

A 'doble spend' in Bitcoin is possible only in an orphaned block (different chain) so it's not a real double spend. You can find some atempts at the same block height, just like the one in OP, but it's almost impossible to orphan/fork more than one block unless you have enough hashpower to do so.

English Press Release:
The Spanish bank Bankinter invests in the bitcoin company Coinffeine
Coinffeine is a distributed FIAT- Bitcoin exchange technology which enables banks and payment processors to offer Bitcoin services without touching Bitcoin
The strategy of Bankinter with this movement is not only to participate in the capital of the company but also to be one of the main clients of Coinffeine in the future.
The spanish bank Bankinter has invested in the capital of Coinffeine, through the Bankinter Innovation Fundation. With this movement, Bankinter becomes one of the first banks in the world dealing with Bitcoin ecosystem.
Funded last June by 4 engineers as the first company in the world using Bitcoin as social capital, Coinffeine is developing a distributed platform to exchange FIAT by crypto­currencies in a secure and anonymous way, using your own bank account for sending FIAT money and transferring the bitcoins outside the bank, in a pure P2P way.
Coinffeine is a desktop application ‘like Bittorrent for your bitcoins’ and will be launched the next January. The big innovation here is the Coinffeine protocol, a mathematical model based on Game Theory. This protocol ensures the safety in the FIAT­Bitcoin exchange without a trusted third party and in a automatically way, offering the same experience as a traditional exchange thought the transactions are really P2P.
The strategy of Bankinter with this movement is not only to participate in the capital of the company but also to be one of the main clients of Coinffeine in the future.
Coinffeine has been selected among the 12 most innovative startups in Spain at the stcimmersion.com to be presented this week at the Silicon Valley Forum ­svforum.org­ in San Francisco.

Yes this is sad, but remember that Satoshi did an astonishing job designing the way to bootstrap this revolution. He was well aware that greed would be one of the most powerful drivers for something like this. The most important thing here is to keep Bitcoin's independence from any political or financial institution, wich is what gives bitcoin it's value, wich is what users need. Social consensus, greed, open source and forks are the tools to keep that independence.

think of satoshis like atoms (created with an special transaction, called coinbase transaction, out of thin air with every block) and utxos are coins made with those atoms. utxos are 'melted' (consumed, aka spent) by transactions that transform them to create new utxos (coins) of different sizes.

Normally anyone with such a hashing power will rather keep its current value than destroy it... unless the attacker, for whatever reason, gets more value from openly destroying the Bitcoin network. When I say "destroying" I mean pushing everyone else, the remaining hashing power, nodes, etc. to react and keep mining on a forked blockchain, but to succed they will have to **significantly** change the protocol to keep it decentralized. You can still call Bitcoin that new protocol, but it will be something radically different.

About government regulations...
"The concept of separating currency and state is often credited to the writings of libertarian economists and philosophers. According to this principle, Satoshi Nakamoto argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Nakamoto, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. "

The amount you send using LN is intended to have no limit, same as there's no limit for onchain fees, but I understand in this case it will work the other way around: if you send too much it may not go through, so the network will estimate up to how much you can send each time. That limit of course will vary depending on use and the total amount deposited by users and nodes on their channels. Now you may not send more than $20, next year it could be $200 and so on. That's how I think it will be.

Nice work, that's very helpfull! I think it would be a good idea to start talking about "new bitcoins" (with a, agreed value measured in satoshis). Something easy to figure out. This is how it has been done with some other currencies. Maybe that new bitcoin (nBTC) can be 100 sat. or 10,000 sat. or 100,000 sat, whatever we agree on it will be good. I like the number 10,000 as it's exactly in the middle between one satoshi and one BTC.
10,000 sat = nBTC     and  10,000 nBTC  = BTC

Sensu contrario, ignorance creates negative sentiment. You can see that on the average mainstream news headlines. We have to teach the media about how bitcoin works. Now this is more or less what they know:
1/ a new virtual currency loved by nerds
2/ they get rich without working, just by using their supercomputers
3/ if you are not a crypto expert they will steal them from you
4/ you can buy drugs, expensive cars...and donate to charities
5/ everyone tries to scam each other
6/ they feel like idiots because they dont understand crypto and dont understand why smart VC is investing
7/ Might be just FAD
That has to change.

You will sell your bitcoins if you need too, the same way you will buy a new computer even if it's going to cost less next month.

Copay.io is still in beta but does the group multisig wallets you are looking for. Do some test before you go with real money.
Coinbase now has "group multisig vaults" (48 hours delay on transactions) but only with two options (2 of 3) and (3 of 5)
Geenaddress and BitGo afaik only have (2 of 3) individual multisig wallets --where they keep one of those keys to always sign the transactions-- so I guess it's not what you are looking for.

Merchant adoption and consumer adoption are drived by different reasons:
*Merchants: they need comsumers to spend their money.

*Merchants: Be able to pay their own suppliers with bitcoin.
*Consumers: Spend BTC to use products or services ONLY AVAILABLE in bitcoin.

I may have misunderstand something but AFAIK 51% attacker doesn't have to change anything in the Bitcoin protocol. All other nodes are the ones that will have to patch the protocol to:
1)  build on a different chain, not on the longest one, and 
2)  to avoid a new attack from someone that already has 51% hashing power. 
I've been using bitcoin since early 2011, so if I'm wrong I'll appreciate very much knowing what I've misunderstand.

Bitcoin is a software that randomly generates unique "units of account" called bitcoins. Finding bitcoins is called mining. They will never be more than 21 million.
Once you own some, you are able to transfer them on the internet the same way you would send an email. That "email" software to send and receive bitcoins is called Wallet.
Bitcoins are sent to (and received from) those addresses. Your wallet creates those addresses and the password needed to send bitcoins from them. No need for an intermediary.
Somehow people started buying bitcoins from others, because mining is a very very difficult task. Markets where you buy and sell bitcoins are called exchanges.
Now you can even buy stuff with them, so thats why some people say bitcoin is like money.

Sorry to say, but you will have to read again what is bitcoin:
Decentralized = no body can create any from thin air.
Programmable = you can integrate the blockchain in your apps.

Ok I may agree with you on drugs war, but lets put it this way: if anyone could now build an atomic bomb using a new discovered technology, should the use of that technology be regulated? I guess it all depends on the benefits/threats balance it poses. But with bitcoin, perceived threats and benefits depends mainly on weather you are a libertarian or not. So as libertarians are not mayority, I guess it has to be regulated in a form that prevents crime and allows for blockchain technology to grow. 
So I go back to my initial question. What options do law enforcement agencies have to prevent crime, without going into strong regulations?

He is right. Why should anyone buy bitcoins and then spend them when they can do that directly without bitcoin in the middle?. Let's face it, most people now don't **need** bitcoin. They don't care about privacy, don't want to invest, don't buy drugs online and don't have do deal with international transfers. They don't even care about inflation.

Correct. Low value transactions will always be The Problem, no matter the block size. This is very simple to understand and that's why I think those who signal for bigger blocks either want to favor business models based on low value transactions (ie gambling) and/or don't care about centralization (ie big miners that will get more power to push a change in the 21 million cap). 
I can't find any other incentive for those asking for bigger blocks.

My briefing to the PR department:
1) Bitcoin is not money, it's a technology of revolutionary consequences.
It can be used to change the way we use money (global, programmable) and control our wealth, but also allows for transparent and irrefutable public ledgers, registries and smart contracts. Bitcoin will not only change the way we use money, just like the Internet didn't change only the way we used mail and fax. We don't know yet how it will change our live.
2) Bitcoin will allow poor people and small business all over the world to have full access to financial services and e-commerce.

I see the future of Bitcoin as any another currency flowing through the backbones of centralized and trusted services. The average consumer needs VISAcoins not Bitcoins.
As a consumer you will keep your bitcoins only as a store of value in cold wallets. You may get paid directly to those cold addresses (maybe tinted addresses, approved by government) and transfer them to centralized services to later spend them with your VISAcoincard.
Highly regulated, highly controlled. I don't say it's good or bad, just the scenario I think we are heading

Well, there's no other way for them and for all of us to really know what the users want. If they allow a fork to take over that's their fault. 
They are smart, they can always find a way to avoid the fork. Maybe adding a voting switch in Core? and then, if 75% of users decide to activate the 2Mb switch (a la XT) we won't need to fork anything.

A password is a good option only if you do not store it in your head (you can forget it  or smash your head, etc.). Better copy the psw protected seed in several thumbdrives and hide them in different locations, and then write down the password also in different locations (be creative). Also use Google Account Inactive feature to send instructions to your relatives in case you die. One of the thumbdrives may have a different seed for a wallet with a low balance, just in case you have to give it to your exwife's lawyer.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:57:36
With BU miners can add UNLIMITED (not just a few) free txs to their blocks, creating a whole new spectrum of opportunities that ONLY THEM can take advantage off, converting miners in banks de facto.
How should it be: With Segwit and Lightning ANYONE can do that, not just a few users (miners).
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:01:51
It's also allowed to propose a decrease in the block size. Absolutly free speach.

Agree with you but everything that Mike has said now was well know before his XT project failed. Everybody has a difficult ego and Mike is not an exception.
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:59:09
I see no blood here. I guess Mike is just tired and he really thinks Bitcoin is going nowhere. That's not my opinion, tho. I hope this social-inepts that are trying to control what Bitcoin is or is not (ie. theymos) get some advice from someone they respect. Bitcoin is not going to die, but this consensus problem may leave some dead bodies in the way. First one is Mike ¿who will be next?
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:59:21
I wonder if Bitcoin will ever be trusted as a world wide currency until all possible scenarios are tested, including a contentious hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:07:36
Of course, no need if you want to perpetrate a 51% attack.
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:38:50
So what is that scope?. Of course security is the whole business here. Bitcoin is and probably will ever be the most secure blockchain on earth, so if they want to play blockchains sidechains are the way to go.  If things go wrong with The Blochchain, I guess they can always deattach their sidechains and plug them to another one.
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:27:51
Yeah, right there: security and decentralization. BU will increase block size without those, we know.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:27:00
Exactly my thoughts. Thanks for writing them so clearly. This BU thing it's just an attack on the protocol to allow some guys to protect their investments. The fact that with Segwit and Lightning ANYONE will be able to create any type of business, is scaring the hell out of them. That's why they want miners to be the only ones to add unlimited free transactions. None of us can compete with that. On the other hand, Segwit + Lightning is open to anyone, not just miners.

You don't need to run a node to use bitcoin. But you alredy knew that, didn't you?

@_date: 2017-03-19 16:48:41
Not the perfect scenario, but it's necessary to prevent a post hardfork attack. It'll be easy to get that hashrate in the Segwit chain, maybe two hours after the first hardfork.

BU is trying to fork the Bitcoin protocol. They think that if a boat has a passenger cap limit, you can just ignore it and let everyone in. NOBODY will trust their money on such an amateurish and sloppy group of developers.
If we ever see a hardfork you will have two coins instead of one. Same thing as selling half of your coins for any another coin. Of those two (bitcoin and bucoin), one will be more valuable than the other, depending on how much people accept each one (the market price for each coin). If you like to bet you can sell your butcoins and buy bitcoins or viceversa.

I do not agree with you at all. Volatility has been going down, adoption up, failure risk off course still exist, never seen anyone here saying otherwise, etc. Sorry to tell you that bitcoin won't be used to price anything, it is a deflationary currency.

Do some research and you will find that BU (those proposing a hostile fork) will crash on the first curve. So I'm confident Core developers will have the economic majority (the most valued coin) on their side after the fork. Security is the most important feature in Bitcoin.

A hardware wallet creates a random key (seed) that can be used by any other wallet if you want. That key is used by the wallet to derive/create as many keys/addresses as needed and also to sign transactions. You should backup that seed in the form of a series of words (those words should never touch a device with internet connection). If you destroy or lose your hardware device you can buy a new one (any one using the BIP-39 standard to convert BIP39 words into a seed key... almost all wallets can do it) and initialize it using your own words.
A hardware wallet receives an unsigned transaction, and returns it signed with the correct key, so the key never leaves the device, only the transaction messages go in and out.

Also this. With a hardware wallet you will never have to put your priv on an online wallet. If your option is paper wallets, to spend those savings you will need to import the key into another wallet to construct the transaction. You may use an offline wallet for that, but that could have some user experience drawbacks depending on your technical knowledge.

Legally speaking is not clear what Bitcoin is, so they can't ban it now. They may define blockchains or crypto algorithms, but if govs try to ban the use of crypto they will restrict any type of digital value transfer. They want to target money laundering and crime,  not the legal use of those technologies. Of course they don't know how to do that yet, so the strategy is to delay adoption until they find the right answer.
The problem comes when someone thinks privacy is a tool for terrorism and money laundry. It's not. It's the right tool (one of the most important ones in this digital era) to make a better world.

It's not really about banning bitcoin, but all cryptos. Also it's not banning, but forcing us all to use their ripped monetary system. That would also mean we are not allowed to privacy nor hard property whatsoever. Banning bitcoin at the end will bring back the guillotines. Social evolution can be delayed but can't be stopped. The same way they tried to ban atheism and democracy and failed, that will happen with bitcoin. I'm sure they will try to delay it, but ideas can't be killed, at least in Europe or Western cultures. My bet is that they will first try to throw a wrench  and see if that is enough to kill the whole thing. Something like asking for ID,  high taxes on transactions, legal paperwork, etc. This won't be a get rich fast schema neither a fun ride to the moon. It's more like a revolution and I don't remember any revolution without blood.

I know, I think the smart contract idea it's something worth exploring, but we are talking about investing in something much more immature, risky and complicated than what bitcoin was in 2009. Satoshi spent several years securing the building blocks of bitcoin, and bitcoin is something very simple. I bet most DAO investors didn't know what they where doing.

They can only get to see the exchange graphics, that's a very powerful driver, and try to profit from it without embracing a long term risk. If they lose money or even if they don't profit enough, they get burned and turn their back to anything bitcoin.

1. You create the transaction message (for this you need access to the blockchain data, whether is online, satellite, your wallet, etc.)
2. You copy that message, take it to the offline device (offline wallet) who has your private key, and sign it.
3. Copy the signed message and take it to an online device (online wallet) who will send it to the network.
A hardware wallet does all this steps for you transparently.

The 21 m cap is one of the most important economic drivers in Bitcoin, not the fact that each one can be measured in satoshis. So who you say should decide the block size, will also be able to change the 21 m limit.

Yes, in my opinion this is the way they sre trying to "regulate" bitcoin. They will ask exchanges to control and declare receive/withdraw addresses. This is already done if required, so nothing new here. People wanting to go dark will use other cryptos or mixers, so nothing new here either.
The question is if the government will be allowed to do this type of mass surveillance without a warrant. If they are, then the next step will be forcing everyone to use ther own government backed shitcoin so they can kill privacy for good and welcome once and for all their much loved totalitarian regime.

1. If this happens, we still have sha256 and RIPEMD160 to secure our funds. Banks, ATMS and almost the rest of the world will be the real victims, not bitcoin.
2. Prohibition is an option for governments, of course this will reduce the price for a while, but it won't stop bitcoin, and will help flourish new undergound economies, making bitcoin valuable again. Remember acohol prohibition in the US?  ...  miss those good mafia times?
3. You are right, bitcoin is not for everyone. You need to understand money and some crypto to trust the system, but I disagree with your term 'apathy' used for that. On the contrary, bitcoin has stimulated new users to understand and use bitcoin as a new store of value and most of them know this is a long term objective. Only those with a low time preference will be victims of bitcoin apathy.

Thanks for the info. You are very fast in your assumptions.  Since I first read Satoshi's pdf in dec 2010 it was clear the blockchain was too valuable a resource to be used to pay for coffees, so I agree with those who now plan scaling off-chain. I don't know anything and I don't care about personal interests of core developers or even Satoshi: this is an open source project. I've seen Adam from the very begining in Bitcointalk but no so much involved at the time, that's true. Remember we all thought Bitcoin was going to be banned?  He is a brilliant guy, as all Core developers, they are an amazing asset of knowledge, really unique. Gavin, I like him too, but fucked up really hard a couple of times. Remember his 16Mb blocks and how everything was going to melt down? Also very gullible with the Craig afair. To bad Roger is in the wrong side, he has character and is really commited to bitcoin. Hope some day we all agree on the longest chain. Decentralization and security are vital issues for Bitcoin survival. That's why I support small blocks, SegWit and off-chain scaling. We should all calm down and stop this conspiracy theories about Core been corrupted. Again, this is my opinion, I don't know everything, not so young for that :)

Not good, nor bad. Means hodlers believe today's value of Bitcoin is too low to spend them. Bitcoin is obviously an store of value and social subjective value of bitcoin is much higher.

Bitcoin is not a company, there is not "first mover advantage", it's a protocol, just like TCP/IP. Do you think there're no "better" communication protocols? Definitely you should learn a bit more about why Bitcoin has all that hash power.
Centralization is something you have to sacrifice if you want to scale, but please do it on optional layers, never on the base layer.

Bitcoin is in a very early stage, breaking out as an store of value in unregulated markets, because it's something never seen before (digital scarcity) and no body knows yet how to deal with it, what do you expect ? Nevertheless Bitcoin can be used now as a long term hedge for inflation and a ever-expanding fiat monetary supply, but not yet as a unit of account to price goods in it. It will take many years to stabilize and only then be used as a unit of account...if it ever does.

Don't try to explain PoW. Just tell him that all new btc created are registered in a shared "spreadsheet" following previosly agreed rules, just like chess has its own rules (no rules, no chess). Then tell him digital scarcity (electronically transferable) is now real for the first time in history just because users had agreed also a limited supply of bitcoins on those same rules. Finally: divisibility. It is working for me.  Good luck
Edit: it always takes time to understand, months maybe, so give him some reading to help him figure out by himself. Saifedean Amous book is the best option.

All this type of questions can be answered if you look at  bitcoin as gold 2.0
I don't think BTC will replace fiat money, for many reason, but on the long term it will replace gold as it has better attributes and functionality, and most important: scarcity is guaranteed by a social contract called The Bitcoin Protocol. The value of lost bitcoins go to current hodlers, their satoshis become more valuable, and of course they will spend them, you will see everyone here loves lambos and good food.
@_date: 2019-06-09 09:30:24
That time will come no matter what because no fiat money can compete with bitcoin at holding value. We should start comparing bitcoin to gold instead of fiat. Fiat makes no sense at representing value, I would rather use toilet paper rolls as a unit of measure.

Right, also noboby uses gold to buy stuff, and it doesn't bother anyone. Bitcoin is gold 2.0,  you can custody it yourself and even buy stuff on the internet with it.  Szaboshi Nickamoto did a big mistake calling it bitcoin instead of keeping its original name bitgold, but he already burned that brand so I guess he had no other choice. Btw, hodlers use it since the very begining as a store of value with great success, and those are the real users.
@_date: 2019-06-20 05:30:04
Anyone thinking CSW could be Satoshi is an scamer or has no idea what is he talking about.  The real Satoshi is the opposit of CSW. I cant imagine Satoshi buying bitcoins in MtGox or producing false evidence as proof of his identity.

Agree with that, but what about wallets? Do you think everybody will have the skills to be their own bank? Look at how many people here gets hacked, don't do proper backups,  forgets a passphrase or simply don't have a legacy strategy. Custodial services wont solve all those problems but they can help if you don't have the skills. Even today most users with small btc use an online wallet. If we ever go mainstream do you think all that is going to change?

I've been running a node at home for many years with a fixed IP modified only once because I changed my ISP, and never ever had a problem. It was a Windows PC at the begining, I even had coins in it for the first two months until I learned to cold storage. Then I changed it to Ubuntu and recently moved it to an Odroid  machine. 
I had the same concerns than you but looks like attacking a bitcoin node is very difficult or has very small reward if any.

Ok. What confused me is him **not** using the term 'block' to describe the data being transmitted for consensus.  I'm not an engineer so I understand very little of this paper, but that was it also the first time I read the Bitcoin white paper. Will love to hear what core devs think about this.
@_date: 2019-06-11 11:21:46
Bitcoins (the tokens) will be the only needed unit of measure **for value** in the internets of money. You can argue that we already have different units of measure for everything (i.e. for distances we have miles, kilometers, etc.) but those were pre-internet and inevitable due to the lack of connectivity. No way it will happen again.

You are right. These tethers and similar fractional money is precisely the opposite of bitcoin. The idea is good only if they can produce a proof of deposits and how they are pegged to each tether without using a trusted third party. I bet they will never do that, and while in this state it should be considered a scam. What really amazes me is the guys buying such a thing without this proof.

I have the idea that crypto currencies form a parallel economy, and "selling" has two different and opposit meanings:
1) Converting BTC into dollars and then buy things with that money. Going back to fiat economy.
2) Buying things directly with  BTC without the need to go through fiat.
IMHO this second one will be the most likely scenario if BTC ever goes mainstream. And that means much softer "market crashes", less "panic selling".

Don't come to the world of "Don't trust, verify" without anything to verify.
If you want to find proofs for your theory:
1. Read the whitepaper and don't stop until you understand everything there.
2. Learn about how bitcoin was created and evolved these last 10 years with special care to events in 2017 (UASF). Bonus if you also take a look to game theory. 
3. Follow up some opensource projects.
4. Subscribe to the bitcoin dev mailing list and read the IRC Meetings
(find the link in bitcoincore.org) 
Finally you will find some proof that we can take a look at if the NSA isn't already controlling your brain.

No, it was never a currency. It will be a currency once it's accepted as a store of value. Scaling issues: read about Lightning Network.


It worked pretty well for me on the last seven years. You just have to be careful with your private keys and don't do trading with an unregulated store of value. With time it will get better, less volatility and easier to use.

What I mean of course is that it was the easiest way at the time for mom and dad to buy and store bitcoins. Nowadays that role has been inherited by Coinbase. The point it's that it's a centralized service, you don't control your bitcoins, you don't have any privacy and they may be working with fractional reserves (aka fake money), so how is that Bitcoin? I understand it helps to get on board, but many people think they have bitcoins when they really own IOU's.

Ethereum... interesting project, but I've been in this space for many years now and I'm still strugling to find a real use case that can't be done much more efficiently with a centralized cluster of databases with hashes and signatures. A real blockchain is like a tank, great to resist attacks, but not to go to the grocery store. The reallity is that if we want to challenge the power of banks and governments creating a new standard, we need something like Bitcoin and a strong community ready to take that challenge. Ethereum is  good to build decentralized apps, but it's not meant to fight a war. Bitcoin, if it finally succeds, will be backing the value of all other tokens.

Lighting Network will provide unlimited transactions for very small  fees. 
I see the Bitcoin main chain as a settlement layer, and not only for money, but for any type of value. So when you buy bitcoins you are really buying a % (not units), of the unlimited tokens available and required to use the most decentralized and secure transaction system in our history.

No. It's exactly the type of advice coming from a trader that sees Bitcoin just as a black box money maker. This is a new technology, an amazing protocol that will change the way we do our savings and interact with value. It's not a buy/sell commodity you can analyze with the same tools, curves and charts to predict how it's "price" is going to evolve like a regular stock out there. If you trade, you are gaming with those who know your cards and can front run the market, and you will lose money. If you buy bitcoins, you should spend bitcoins, and while you wait for retailers to accept it, you will see a deflationary effect on it's value due to increased demand. That's all you have to do.

If you want to replace Bitcoin with something better at becoming a global value measuring standard, then you will need to replace the users, not the tech. Bitcoin is not technology, it's a social contract on some mission and values like the consensus on its fixed cap. Would a new blockchain emerge with a different consensus algo and different inflation strategy attract more users than Bitcoin? What I mean is consensus is more about economics than IT.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:29:22

Satoshi "*The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms*"

1) they are rewarded for creating valid blocks, not for "solvin" transactions.
2) fees will cover mining expenses, also difficulty will go down if mining is not good business 
3) value depends on network effect, also can follow the best coin (honest and smart devs and best protocol) creating new opportunities for those on the loop if the legacy coin gets corrupted.
4) it all started with a pizza. anything can have value transfer properties if it's scarce and we all agree it has value. also bitcoins are secured by huge burning of energy.

You only store keys in your wallet. The bitcoins are just entries in a ledger (blockchain) stored in thousands of nodes. The wallet monitors a random node for entries (bitcoins) that belong to your keys and displays the results to you.

Good article, but one wrong statement... the author says "[the blocksize debate ] raising the cap, a decision that could make more bitcoin transactions possible but also might expose the system to problems such as someone trying to use the same bitcoin to make two different purchases at the same time."

Profitable mining will be a huge incentive to create cheap energy sources. Mining will be more effective, less costly just to be able to survive with fees. Of course onchain txs will be much more expensive but the adoption of L2 solutions like LN will need less onchain settlements. Also the market will adjust (already happened several times) to be profitable. I think miners are now spending too much on mining, but that will change.

You have plenty of payments options already in the market with far better "widespread adoption" that "just work". If bitcoin has some value it's not bc of that. Bitcoin is much more important that a payment network that "just works". Bitcoin started to gain value when there was no way to buy anything on the internet with it.  It's basic business: know what you are good at.  If bitcoin is secure &amp; scarce, thats all it needs to be accepted everywere. Imagine all merchants in the world accepting bitcoin and VISA, what do you think people will use? . OP just needs a wallet in Coinbase or in Paypal, those two "work" better than bitcoin. Encryption has value, and it's not because it's widespread adopted.

You are totally right, but many bitcoin users would have to comply even with a corrupt and tyrannical system. They are already doing it, me too if I want to buy in an exchange, so nothing new here. In order to free ourselves from tyranny, we first need the tools, and hopefully those tools are coming soon. Decentralized anonymous markets and exchanges, on pair with a fully anonymous bitcoin... that should be the focus right now, not the stupid block size debate. Bitcoin was not created to allow us to buy more coffees, but to protect our Liberty and Privacy.

*They can forbid fiat/crypto pairs in centralized exchanges.
*They can infiltrate decentralized exchanges.
*They can easily ban bitcoin nodes in satellites.
Of course all this will destroy all the legal crypto industry and the only option for our savings to survive the next and inevitable financial meltdown. On the other hand we will see a profitable and strong illegal industry growing up, much more difficult to avoid than drug cartels are now.

Thanks you pointed me on the right direction. Looks like SPV wallets ask nodes for the required info using BIP37 bloom filters. I guess this stateless blockexplorer could use the same technique not for all addresses of course, but for an small set just like SPV wallets do. This bloom filters are allowed (?) for a wallet with a limited set of keys, but not for a blockexplorer that queries all addresses. This is to avoid excesive load on nodes and DoS attacks.

It's very ease to understand that people buy fiat with bitcoin because Bitcoin is in its very early stage and not everybody accepts bitcoins. It doesn't have anything to do with it not beign money. I can accept dollars, but I sell them for euros because in my country we use euros. Does that mean the dollar is not money?
You also say deflationary money won't be used as money... lets see, not every body agrees with that. But if that is the case, remember we are dealing with an open source protocol, not a traditional commodity, don't understimate that. I also thought the Internet was not good to watch HD films.

Ok, then Bitcoin will be worthless, I agree. I always compare Bitcoin with gold. That means its value comes from scarcity and difficulty to mine.

Market cap means nothing. I can create 9 trillions of tokens and buy 100 in a market for $1. What does it mean? Besides, other cryptos don't have same developer team, dynamic git repository, hashing power, strong protocol in production for more than 7 years, immutability, censorship resistance, world wide recognition, network effect, etc. etc. Also, number of transactions have to be compared apples to apples.

1) Open an account on Coinbase or any other Exchange (I use Kraken). Don't forget to activate 2FA authentication.
2) Buy just 1btc or less.
2) Buy Trezor making a transaction from your btc account on the exchange.
3) Once you have the Trezor use mytrezor.com to create a new wallet. Don't forget to write down the 'seed' on paper (don't copy it in any electronic device). Save that paper on a secure location.
4) Transfer the rest of your btc on the exchange to an address on mytrezor.com. You don't need Electrum.
5) Play with it, making some test transactions, etc. so you know how it works.
6) Buy more btc on the exchange and repeat step

Not against incressing block size with a hardfork, but only if its the ONLY solution to scale.

This is a very old debate, whether is the best scaling strategy depending on where you put your priorities. Both are valid, for me is like deciding between Bitcoin and Ethereum, it depends on what you want to do. What I detest is the ad hominem attacks and lies against Core devs because they all agree on the 'decentralization first' side. At the end it's not bad to have both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash and let the users decide what they want. What I really don't understand is why now that each one finally has what they want, there's some people still attacking core devs and this part of the community. We are very proud of them and we think they are the most important asset in Bitcoin Core, but I understand you may not agree.  I don't want Bitcoin Cash to die or to change anything, it's the best option for those who want bigblocks, we should all be happy now.

The fact is that nobody knows how much support do the independentists have. Lets say they have 50%, so what do we do with the other half?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:08:02
This is a succinct timeline (excuse my English, I'm not a native speaker)
1. A strategic and public debate begins on how to overcome the Bitcoin block capacity limit of 1Mb.
* 1a) The simplest aproach is to increase the block size, but there is a risk of centralization, reducing the number of nodes and not actually solving the problem. We will always have more transactions than those which any block size will allow. This one is the option supported by r/btc
* 1b) The other option, this one proposed by most developers and almost the whole community, considers the blockchain a very valuable and scarce resource, so not needed to keep there millions of micropayments or coffee transactions. It's the option supported by Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core) and goes on to facilitate safe off-line transactions and use the main chain also as a settlement service  (open and close micropayment channels).
2. Bitmain, a Chinese maker of ASIC chips for mining, discovers algorithm (ASICBoost) to mine faster than the competition and keeps it a secret. Option 1a above (specifically the Segwit technology that is part of that strategy) would destroy that miner's advantage, reason why he initiates a disinformation campaign against Core devs and SegWit without revealing their authentic motives. Note: Bitmain controls directly or indirectly almost 40% of the mine business, which is already quite dangerous for the network's health.
3. Meanwhile Bitcoin devs update the protocol to incorporate Segwit and activate it as soon as 90% miners acceptance is reached. As they do not know yet about ASICBoost, they ignore that that 90% will never be reached and the update will never activate. This "debate" creates very unpleasant and adhominem discussions with insults and lies spilled to almost all the community by Bitmain partners in r/btc. The trolls are finally banned from r/bitcoin and they start using the mantra "r/bitcoin is censored" as a convenient battering ram for their big block cause.
4. To unlock the scaling debate a significant part of the community decides to create a Segwit version to be activated on August 1st without the need of that 90% acceptance by miners. That would also have the risk of creating two chains. It was called UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) and it was not finally activated because more than 90% of miners accepted the original Bitcoin Core Segwit. Continue reading to learn why the did it.
5. Many Bitcoin companies, usually on the fringe of any debate, were frightened by the possibility of UASF provoking an split and proposed this agreement to miners: miners will accept Bitcoin Core SegWit and in return they will manage to force an increase in the block size from 1Mb to 2Mb. The agreement was called Segwit2x and was signed in NY without any participation from developers (they were and still are 100% against a direct blocksize increase, at least in such a short period of time). Bitmain and partners did accept that agreement because it was giving them what in *theory** (and only in theory) they were asking for: bigger blocks. That agreement was mainly intended to avoid an split.
6. Those same miners, frightened by the consequences that SegWit will inflict to their covert ASICBoost business, finally decide to create their own coin, called Bitcoin Cash, of course with no SegwWit. However, as ASICBoots came to light, and thus the real motives against SegWit, this coin has not had the expected success.
7. Everything we have experienced so far has shown us that the union of developers, users and investors has an strong vote in deciding the future of Bitcoin, even more than any large group of miners. 
8. At this point miners already know that Bitcoin Cash is not going to supplant Bitcoin unless they kill the main chain and get investors to buy their Bitcoin Cash.  This is exactly why they support a blatant stupid and dangerous hard fork (Segwit2x) on the main chain and  later on "fire" core developers.

I understand it's impossible for everybody to agree on what Bitcoin is. Current devs have proven history of firm cypherpunk principles. If you don't mind about anonymity and censorship you may agree with Jeff Garzik's vision.

Satoshi said in his white paper that the chain with more PoW is the valid one... but Satoshi didn't want his word to be considered a dogma. Changing labels may take Xapo down into a legal abyss no matter what they publish in that post. We all have to agree on a naming policy for all the hard forks and define which chain will be called Bitcoin. We can choose a simple rule avoiding the problem of variable PoW and labels. Something like ***Bitcoin will be the chain with less hardforks.*** If Core decides to do a hardfork, we will have to call it something else. This means Bitcoin can someday disappear. No problem.

You are right, but it has improved a lot this last years. What most people don't understand here is that Bitcoin doesn't disrupt the commercial banking system as much as it disrupts central banks. But curiously Bitcoin was created not to get a faster payment system, but to protect our privacy and that's WHY it gets rid of middlemen.

1. Dedicate some time to learn why was it created for. Search for the Andreas Antonopoulos video channel in Youtube and read "The Bitcoin Standard" from Saifedean Ammous.
2. Understand how it works, what is a hash and a public key. Depends on your current knowledge but the best guides out there can be found in 
  (maintained by Jameson Loop).
3. Open an account on a exchange like Kraken.com or Coinbase.com, get verified and buy some bitcoin. Test it first with small quantity ($50). Never go to those sites through a web search to avoid phishing scams.
 
3. Read some wallet security tips and transfer all those bitcoins to a simple mobile wallet. If you have Android use the well known Bitcoin Wallet  
4. Install a desktop wallet like Electrum and do some transactions from mobile to desktop and viceversa.
4. When you are confident and ready to invest, buy a hardware wallet (Trezor) to hodl your bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-09-06 06:15:54
I don't think so. You spend because you need the things you buy. The same way you buy a laptop today, despite its price going down on time. With an inflationary system, you spend money even to buy things you don't need, or even buy them with debt, wich drives the economy to a false state of "economic progress". Of course if bitcoin volatility stays high for ever, that's not good, but I don't think that will be the case in 20 years from now. Bitcoin is just money that does not loose it's value, and volatility is high bc  it's still been introduced into our society. OP is worried about people not using it, but I have used bitcoin many many times when price was a little bit more stable.
@_date: 2019-09-27 04:50:01
The difference with fiat is that owning bitcoin doesn't give you any rights on how the show should be run. Of course you can manipulate centralized markets, but that's as far as you can get. I guess we will have to deal/ignore  this bubbles/crashes cicles for a long time.

As an extra, if you hold bitcoins, you also have lottery tickets if some super invention needs to use the blockchain (21inc? side chains? ...)

The "I follow the longest chain" it's a protocol rule to define which chain is still Bitcoin, nothing to do with a technical barrier. As this definition has some serious problems we have to change it and rule it as "the valid chain is the one with less hard forks". This definition has some more logic, as the longest chain can always shrink back and become invalid a few days latter.

Up to the summer of 2010 I was ignoring almost everything about digital currencies. It was 'monopoly money' used by gamers. Then I read something that made me go to bitcoin.org and download Satoshi's paper. As soon as I read it I knew this was something completly different. Not digital money but decentralized, open source and limited supply. Then I spent 3 months trying to know who Satoshi was and reading everything on bitcointalk.org. Then at the end of 2010 I though I undestanded it enough to start mining (no luck) so I decided to buy some as a test on MtGox. On may 2011 I paid for a .bit domain with bitcoin and decided to buy more, sometime later everything crashed, first Bitcoin dead :) etc. Didn't buy as much as I wanted as I was sure it was going to be banned/regulated and used only as the dark money of the Internet. Now after 6 years i still don't know what is the future of Bitcoin.
Anyone getting into Bitcoin now will be considered an early adopter in no more than 5 years.

I agree, should be, but that is too wide. Inside money we still have to find the killer app that will drive mainstream adoption. Its nice to have the *option* to pay with bitcoin in some cases, or doing transfers, but I do have other means to do the same. My bet is that it will come with something related to multisig and internet payments.

Two ways to go. 1) Use the new banks. Circle/Coinbase centralized tools resembling the ones now available from banks, or   2) Be your own bank. The decentralized  option where you can be scammed or hacked. In either case we first need to develop tools to config signing protocols and manage private keys.

But open-source doesn't have insides, only outsides. It would have to be a massive and globally coordinated attack on the economic majority via strong regulation. That won't destroy Bitcoin, but it will put it on the dark side, just like drugs. That will kill the dream of having a new monetary standard and most importantly, it will destroy the best tool we have ever had to keep our privacy and thus our freedom.

It makes sense to put up to 10% of your savings in electronic gold, no matter what the price is now. It will always perform better that fiat or phisical gold in the long run. There are other good investments to hedge against a global financial crisis, but  Bitcoin definitely is one of them.

Bitcoin is a new monetary standard (like a new kind if gold) and Blockchain is just a technology. 
- Predictable inflation policy
- Immutable scarcity

An open source protocol can't be hacked. Maybe some data in the &gt;100.000 nodes can be changed against protocol rules, but it will be easily detected and ignored by the rest. If its a crypto  break on ECDSA it will stop not only Bitcoin transactions but all banking in the world. Even then bitcoins will be safe if not moved, but all fiat accounts in banks will be exposed and hacked.
The problem here is not about hacking, but more about a social agreement. Bitcoin users will never accept a mutation on the inflation rate even if Satoshi resurrects, because that's where bitcoins main value comes from. Whoever don't understand that is buying altcoins because they are "cheaper".

Last post from Mike Hearn here     explains what's going on with Bitcoin Core development. At the end this means that core developers won't reach consensus and the rest of us will have to vote by using one client or the other. I don't see any problem doing that, and I guess it's something we will had to do anyway sooner or later.

Let's see what happens. There's many people on the big-block side that don't oppose Segwit /malleability fix. Segwit by it self won't end the scaling debate but at least it will give us some time to see if we really need a hardfork. I hope not, and that Segwit will allow a lot more scaling options.

Do you know of any steps being made by devs to include BIP100 into Core? Something most people agree with, even Adam Back, is that we need a block increase, at least until Sidechains/LN become reliable to manage transactions (1-3 years?). So what's the plan? Mike Hearn says so far there's no plan, thus leading us to collapsing nodes. Don't mind increasing fees but I think it's too early to get rid of the "almost for free" mantra. That one is a huge argument in favor of Bitcoin adoption and facilitator of transaction testing.

Besides, he doesn't say why Bitcoin is flawed, but let me guess, he has no clue how the blockchain works so that's why he has to come up with "the value of society, economy and humanity". Or maybe he thinks mathematics, privacy, free trade, computers and the internet don't sum up for "society, economy and humanity"

I like that idea. But why not 100 satoshis = 1 "new bitcoin"?. With enough time (10 years maybe) almost everyone and everything will be updated the "new" will start being dropped naturally. So now 1 "old bitcoin" = 1 million "new bitcoins".

If you use bitcoin (you own the keys), no way to fractional reserve. 
Only fractional if you accept IOUs (on bitcoin, fiat or whatever else). What we usually call fiat money are really IOUs (fractional-fiat) issued by commercial banks on other IOUs issued by central banks who relay on bonds and assets denominated in IOU's of fractional-fiat issued by banks and their clients. 
I really still don't know how this can work.

Segwit does rise the number of txs, almost double it, without (the risk of) a hardfork.


I think you underestimate what governments can do to normal people, I mean those who don't have the skills to use Tor securely, and to businesses.


So you really think running a node with a Pi and 1/2Mb blocks has the same cost as running a noisy computer with enough bandwidth to support 4+Mb blocks? No, of course not. You may think it doesn't make any big difference, buy I rely on common sense to think different. BTW BU opens the door to much bigger blocks, so it's a backdoor to destroy decentralization. I may accept a hardfork to 2Mb blocks if it's done by Core devs under peer review and with enough time to minimize the risk, and include many other things that are waiting to be deployed as a hardfork. I just want Bitcoin to be the most secure blockchain in the world, for any other features I already have many other options inside and outside the crypto space.

I agree 100% with you. The real problem with that people is they don't want to understand. They are in fight back mode, not in discovery mode. It takes an special kind of brain to change sides while on a discussion, but it may happen afterwards. New arguments need to be processed and approved by personal experiences, and of course not everybody has had the same experiences during their lives.
Why would they ever need to save forever millions of coffee payments on the most secure (and $20,000 per node) blockchain? A PoW blockchain is not a free resource. I want to be extra conservative with such a new and disrupting tech, than take the slightest chance to kill it because we want to pay coffees with it. Bitcoin is here to be the backbone of one of the most important revolutions in our modern history, not to compete with Paypal. There will be blood, and when that time comes, we will all be very happy to have the chance to run our own node.

I got to that same conclusion in 2011, really not hard to grab. Waiting since for an off-chain scaling solution. And now that we have a good one, we have to see how a dishonest ASIC manufacturer and a butthurt ego can hold us all back. PoW seems not to be a great idea after all if UASF does not win this battle. That's why I'm all into UASF. Just the same feeling, Bitcoin is all or nothing.

Looks like I was wrong, we have customs, but Correos only talks about customs when you ship to non EU Countries, Ceuta, Melilla and Canary Islands, a bit confusing. I guess they dissociate tax "cusmoms" from  police "screening", but at the end is the same thing.
No, I did not report it to Correos, I already know what they will say and how much time it will take.
Now that Mycelium has come out saying it was their fault, I don't really know what to think about all this. My envelope was ripped open, seals opened, the device clearly misplaced inside the box,.... that's not Mycelium's fault. And this is not me only.

This is the case for most retailers. They are not really taking bitcoin, but using the bitcoin payment network and processors to accept fiat. That makes the point that Bitcoin IS NOT, at it's core nature, a payment network. It is mostly an electronic, private an inflation-proof store of value.

Segwit softfork does increase the blocksize in a much safer way than with a HF brute block size increase, and opens Bitcoin to work with other networks that can take care of millions of instant transactions with much lower fees.
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:16:30
Segwit is dangerous for those who want to control Bitcoin. Just look at how these attacks come in organized waves. Now it's Segwit's time. Before it was "small blocks are the reason why the mempool is flooding", etc. Real target is to fire core devs and take control of the reference client.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:27:08
See. Core devs are not Greg Maxwell's employees. There's no Blockstream conspirancy, just a huge community supporting individual devs. We don't care about what Gavin, Bitmain, Blockstream or any "industry agreement" or elite decide what Bitcoin should be. This is how it works.
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:09:28
I'd rather see test on other networks as a proof that 2+Mb blocks are not harmful before a HF. Don't you?


No I don't think so, and I didn't say so.

Agree with you that a rushed update is no good, so that's why we have to be prepared ahead of time!   I also agree that decentralization is the most valuable asset for Bitcoin, but....     I was 28 yo when 80mb HD where top and exclusive and color monitors did't even exist, 33 yo when consumer internet speed was at 28.8k. The centralization bc/ lack of speed and computing resources is total non sense. Believe me, that is not a solid argument, it has to be something else.

You are right. But I think he is talking  on how to finance the $20,000 nodes, without reducing current miner income. Next Jihan step is "we need to increase inflation to pay for those nodes, not miners". Tip: if UASF fails, at that time (two years?) most nodes will be controlled by him.

This concept doesn't make the assumption Bitcoin stays small, as Segwit already increases capacity.  It also brings us the opportunity to keep Bitcoin strong enough while we develop  layer 2 solutions (aka coffee networks) that don't really need all the strength of the immutable backbone we will need to power a really disrupting financial revolution.

@_date: 2019-05-09 17:07:25
The important question is who is holding the keys. Your coins are always in the blockchain unless you use a bank like Coinbase, etc. In your case the keys are in the phone and the coins in the blockchain, and you can restore those keys in any other wallet using your seed words.
Use that phone for pocket money and get a hardware wallet if you are goin to hold more than i.e. $1000

Why should we compromise with these new crypto banks?. Bitcoin is all about **the users**, not to change who manages our money. No company, no business, no miner, no cartel meeting will ever change why Bitcoin exists. UASF is much more than activating Segwit, is a message to the whole comunity: Bitcoin is for the users, not for miners. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:13:00
You are wrong. It was posted on r/btc the same day, and downvoted hard.

Right, you have no idea. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:29:36


They don't, that means bigger blocks solve nothing. Anyway miners are not after their own fees, they want to open a gate to their own transactions with lower fees. Businesses associated with a mining pool will get free entry in their blocks. The rest of us will have to pay. LN opens the gates to many other players.

I guess all the users, wallets and exchanges that support Core devs and Segwit (80%) will go for UASF. There is not better option at this point. Those miners who reject Segwit on August 1st know they will be doing a lot of harm to themselves. Pure game theory. UASF will finally solve this problem so we can all go back to work.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:38:57
I'm in favor of an small block size increase, at least until LN are usable, but as I'm not an expert programmer I'll support whatever the core developers say. I don't like those who don't stop crying, take everything into a personal level, name calling, etc.

People here thinking paper bitcoins (fractional reserve), future contracts, derivatives... will be good for the value of bitcoin don't know what they are talking about. They think fiat price of btc has something to do with its value. The only thing that gives value to Bitcoin is its antifragility, strength to keep its scarcity and resist censorship. Regulations, investors or weak hands don't affect the REAL value of Bitcoin. So, yes, two profiles: cypherpunks or lambo kids. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:23:01

This is what I see on this Rootstock's sidechain idea:
1) Evolves bitcoin functionality without risking the bitcoin blockchain.
2) It's able to leverage the power of the biggest and securest blockchain.
3) It's conservative and doesn't mind using non crypto technology to add and extra security layer while it develops to a full crypto solution.

Also allows for a tone of innovations based on layer 2: lightning, smart contracts, micropayments. It's tested, its works, and it does all this with just a softfork with no risk for anyone.

* Not a Myth: mining can be centralized, lots of signals out there and that it's a real danger.
* Not a Myth: large blocks promote network centralization, less privacy and forces trusted nodes (aka, security holes)
* Not a Myth: If users don't pay fees, the only way to pay for mining operations would be changing the 21 million cap to increase miners block rewards.
* Not a Myth: UASF is the best option to unblock the scaling debate activating Segwit, the most wanted feature by a huge majority.

Someone sold you his bike and you pay him with a Tx in block n. You both wait for 2 confirmations (n+2) and afterwards you leave the scene driving the bike. When you get home you start mining blocks n (this time without your Tx), n+1, n+2, n+3 , etc. (not publishing them) until you surpass current block height. Once you have a longer chain in your computer you publish all those blocks. The protocol says nodes have to follow the longest chain, so when they see your published blocks they will follow that chain (your chain) as valid. The seller of the bike will see his bitcoins disappearing from his wallet.

Yes Bitcoin is the protocol and Bitcoin Core is a software implementation of it, and the most important one (not the "official" one), also called the "reference implementation" of the Bitcoin protocol. There is nothing official about it.

Thanks for this post. It's a similar experience I had. I'm strongly against censorship, and that was why I subscribed to r/btc... until it became clear for me that that sub was getting highly emotional and less rational and dedicating most of its time to attack and spread lies.

@_date: 2017-06-08 09:22:50
I rather have one split bitcoin with Segwit and some future than something that goes nowhere because it can't scale.

Each node has a mempool, and the owner can config its size. If he wants he can block incoming txs into his mempool, but only in his node.

Theoretically, Bitcoin offer is not fixed, as each bitcoin can be divided as much as you want (now caped to 100 M satoshis per bitcon only for optimization), so that makes the market the real issuer of bitcoin money. Try to do that with any other commodity.

Bitcoin it's not an smart bet to get rich fast, but a huge switch in how the system works. It's a non return voyage, no "cash out"... it would be better to call it "Cash down" instead.

I think he is right on this one. Bitcoin it's fixed on an horizontal dimension (21M basic units) and infinite in a vertical one (divisible by any natural number, thus, infinite units available).

Of course your friend does not live in Venezuela. What does your friend think about gold?  At this point in time there're more chances for a bank or a gov money to crash than bitcoin going down. Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, dollars are backed by governments, those that keep on falsifing billions and raping your dollar wallet every year.

We should start differentiating from 'accepting donations' and 'accepting payments'. Good to see more companies aware of bitcoin, but the turning point here is to see them accepting payments, not donations.

Why do they keep calling bitcoin a "digital currency" when it's really a "decentralized currency" ?
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:59:40
0.00000001 BTC is the smallest amount that can be handled in a transaction today. **If necessary**, the protocol and related software can be modified to handle even smaller amounts.

A clarifying post....
No. You Western guys completely misunderstood the news. To me, this is actually BULLISH!
TL;DR, the document says:
1. Bitcoin is a virtual commodity, not a real currency
2. People have the freedom to trade bitcoin, but they need to take their own risk
3. At this stage, financial institutions cannot denominate services and products in bitcoin, cannot trade bitcoin, cannot run bitcoin exchange, cannot provide bitcoin related services, cannot store bitcoin for clients, cannot establish bitcoin trust or fund, etc.
4. Bitcoin exchanges must be registered, and follow AML and KYC rules
This means major Chinese bitcoin exchanges like BTCChina will stay. You just won't see any Chinese bitcoin ETF anytime soon.

Backed by no regulation but protocol. Guess it's better and stable.

Not sure everyone is going to have an aha moment. I bought some bitcoins in early 2011, only after three months of research, not before, so my aha moment was before I bought. I know people that is on board also, and they still have no idea of the protocol, they are just worried about missing an investment opportunity. Those will may never go through their aha moment .

This is an interesting answer from another post...One important motive is to have addresses whose base58 encoding fits on a single line in cut-and-pasteable form. You might laugh at this, but it deters people from concocting bloated and complex directory services and/or public key infrastructures. Fitting on a single line was an explicit goal of Satoshi's key encoding. However ECDSA keys are actually very short. The original bitcoin client shipped with support only for uncompressed keys, whose base58 encoding is just a bit too long to fit on one line. The compressed keys created by newer versions of bitcoin-qt (0.7.0 and later, I think) are only ~44 chars long in base58 form, plus a few more for the checksum.
However bitcoin has another motivation for using hashes-of-keys. In the event that the underlying public key crypto (ECDSA) were compromised or found to be weak, theft of coins from an address which has received coins but never sent them requires being able to perform a preimage attack on the key hashing algorithm too (which in the case of bitcoin is actually two different hash functions cascaded one after another so you must preimage both). On the scale of "likelihood of being flawed" hash functions are way way way below public-key crypto. This means that in the event of a cataclysmic flaw in ECDSA people can revert to a more restricted mode of operation: when spending coins from an address, spend all of them to fresly-created addresses. Never send coins to an address from which coins have been spent. This is a huge inconvenience but at least it would preserve the value embodied in the blockchain. Coins would be exposed to theft only between the broadcast of a transaction and the mining of the next block (about ten minutes) and it's unlikely that anything short of an unimaginably-collossal flaw in ECDSA is going to allow keys to be cracked in such a short period of time.

I also have to deal with international wire transfers and what this guy is saying is completely true in all those points. In some other countries it's even worst.
I always thought that bitcoin fits better in this scenario than in the "buy a coffee". The problem is that B2B changes are always very slow, and usually follow what everybody else is already doing, so the "buy a coffee" it's necessary for others to learn.

From the article [... The other way through which the dollar can lose value is via its exchange rate to other currencies.  Foreign holders of dollars, watching five years of dollar creation in order to finance federal budget deficits and seeing no end, can come to the conclusion that their dollar holdings are being diluted.  If they make this decision, they will decide to get out of dollars or to reduce their exposure to the US dollar.]
