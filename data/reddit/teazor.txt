Only requirement is to have a phone.
Step 1: You enter your cellphone number, it will send you a verification code.
Step 2: You scan your QR code, if you don't have one, it will print a paper wallet for you.
Step 3: You put your money in and that's it.

To buy bitcoins on a exchange, you need to get verify, sometimes it takes up to 2 months. After that, when you deposit your money, it takes 2-5 business days to actually have it in your account.
A bitcoin ATM is completely anonymous.
