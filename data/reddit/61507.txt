I don't think most of Buttcoin even thinks the tech is a pyramid scheme.  Bitcoin is the medium and a medium that happens to make schemes much easier than heavily regulated markets with known actors.  If you buy a couple bitcoins to trade for a few sheets of lsd than odds are things will work out fine.  
If you prepay for a machine which turns electricity into money you may end up a victim.  If you put your money in any currency and just expect it to go up without the benefit of a career in FOREX you're going to get burned (and no buying bitcoin early doesn't count).  Unregulated exchanges are going to reliably fuck you over eventually.  Getting every coffee shop in your area to take bitcoin is only going to make people hate it as long as it is difficult, risky and expensive to turn the bitcoins back into USD.    
What's entertaining about a lot of this is while the tech may be new the schemes are old as dirt.  It's like everyone has saddled themselves with pennystock drama for little if any benefit.  It's why most of the world does not try to make everyone anonymous, it's unworkable from a security standpoint.  Unless of course you're buying lsd, than the risk and fees might be worth it.  The people paying fees to buy bitcoins then trying to get a coffee shop owner to take the bitcoin only to have to pay fees to turn it back to usd are doing it wrong...

It's mind boggling that anyone would see that as an attractive option.  Have USD/EUR &gt; Bitcoin (pay fees) &gt; Peg to USD/EUR (pay fees) &gt; USD/EUR to actually use it (pay fees)...
At no point in this process is there any conceivable upside over holding USD/EUR.  I can't even think of a hypothetical one no matter how unlikely and fantastic. 
This of course assumes each step is actually successful.

Tops MtGox?  Did a third of the money in FOREX just disappear?  What's 3.9 Trillion x 30%?  
This represents 1/3900th of the FOREX market...

Yes.  It had nothing to do with a tech vulnerability.

Strong in the sense price discovery may be quicker and more accurate, but not in the sense price will rise.

Innocent until proven guilty is a bad policy on anything mostly unregulated.  The Federal agencies other posters are mentioning aren't going to do shit for as a preventative, especially for any firm not based in the US.    
Generally firms get audited if they want to deal with large amounts of other people's money in some cases because the regulations demand it and for the rest of them because few people would give them money otherwise anyway.  This doesn't usually apply to bitcoin companies for some strange reason, people give them money anyway.
No one other than someone who's audited a firm has any credible basis to say if they're a scam or not from an investment/money handling standpoint.  It's a little more complicated than rating a seller on Ebay or something.

To clarify they definitely used undercover agents who succeeded in gaining admin privileges in this case.  
The paper is interesting, it goes way over my head and traffic analysis is a weak point.  It was written a while back so I'm not sure what if anything has been done to harden Tor.

That there is a difference between the CEO of an audited firm talking up their company and an anonymous bitcoint firm doing the same.  The CEO can get sued for blatantly lying to shareholders...

Instead of the loser of one of the biggest wars, a marginalized member of a currency union and third world countries..why not ask first world countries who issue debt in their own currency about inflation over the last 100 years?
Not saying there aren't things to be learned from these scenarios, but they don't inform investment decisions based on inflation expectations for the upper first world.

Bitcoin and firm's that operate in it are not in the same category as publicly traded firms on major indexes.  They are in the same category as penny stocks...unaudited and ripe with fraud.

Bitcoin only services sort of breaks basic econ in the sense the business owner would be limiting their customer basis on a strictly altruistic/belief in Bitcoin basis rather than an economic incentive for which the opposite is true.

I get they meant the total value of the theft.  The point is the total value of the theft isn't really what is relevant when comparing to "fiat" currency used in a regulated environment.  It isn't hypocritical to favor the regulated market over the unregulated one even if single instances of fraud or bankruptcy are the same size.  As this failure is 1/3900th of the FOREX market, it isn't exactly evidence against fiat currency or regulation...  
The only reason this was posted in this sub is to give the mistaken impression regulated fiat markets have comparable risk to unregulated bitcoin firms.  Bicoin markets allowed almost a 1/3 of their assets to disappear..FOREX markets allowed 1/3900th.  In other words someone's wearing clownshoes...
This FOREX post is a prime example of this sub being cultish.  Most of us detractors think bitcoin is cool, it's a question of being honest about the risk.  I'm just putting things in context.  
It's like "Oh, look everyone..the idiots with the regulated fiat just lost 1/3900th of their market...that's worse than when we put 1/3rd of our money in one firm and it was stolen...wonder if they'll finally realize our system is better..."

What happened to free speech?  Reddit seems to be perfectly fine with people ranting about shills and chemtrails..I certainly approve...lets hear some names:)

Unless there are some new developments I'm not aware of I doubt it.  This is a good read: 
Whether or not a tech vulnerability exists is besides the point as they had an undercover with Admin privileges on the site and they caught up with the main Admin because he used his real name to buy the hosting.  They only took down 17 people so far and unless those 17 are the heaviest people on the site (We'll see) it looks like they took down the low hanging fruit.  
They'll raid people over very little these days, if they could id people based on a vulnerability with Tor/PGP/Bitcoin it stands to reason they would be doing so with far greater frequency.  
Don't assume these 17 people didn't all make huge/obvious mistakes unrelated to tech.

I think affinity is the driving force behind most the bitcoin scams.  The medium makes them easy, but there's something motivating mostly tech savvy people into diving straight into a lot of obvious scams.  
It's hard to remain objective about something you love involving people who share your interests.  People will fall into the same traps with religion, race even sports.

This isn't pumping a stock.  If a CEO went around and said the kind of things everyone on this sub constantly falls for in scam after scam they would be sued and lose and unlike a bitcoin CEO they could be sued and might have some money if they lost.  
You guys on the other hand are proof you can't just sue anyone for anything...try suing the entity that took 1/3 of your funbux at MtGox...it's all on the blockchain right?  Those coins will turn up eventually and then that entity will be forced to give the coins up and go to court bringing libertarian justice to the world.  
To sum it up I wouldn't dismiss actually pumping of bitcoin because firm leadership in the real world is usually optimistic.  Bitcoin and the firms within look and function exactly like penny stocks from an investment perspective.  They keep failing at extremely high rates and their is no way to tell which will fail and which won't.  Without auditing there isn't any way to know who to invest in or what exchange to use.  The chatter on here is just chasing your tail, you might as well pick an unaudited exchange out of hat..be a little self aware and stop pretending your market is like a regulated one..the amount of successful scams says it isn't..

Which also happens to be the most important attribute of any currency, the idea that other people will take it..

Really though we don't want to see people get ripped off as much as we enjoy watching people who disagree with us get ripped off as a consequence...it's complicated.
