In order of our priorities it is actually:
1. Have Fun 
2. Drink 
3. Paint 
so I see your point.

We are located in Phoenix, AZ.  Excited to be one of the new niche markets to be accepting bitcoins!  Does anyone know which directory I can submit to for businesses taking BTC?

AA gets me excited about the future for sure, makes me think twice about how this experiment will play out over the next few decades and that I should continue to hodl.

I read this story and I just had to register and comment on how awesome it is for your son!!!  Being a Dad, I really know how important and challenging it is to pass on the values and lessons you learn in your own life.  I am so excited to hear how receptive your son is.   
 Starting when she was 6 months my wife started putting $50 from my paycheck into an account for her, when we heard about bitcoins, we started putting that $50 towards bitcoins.  If I hadn't put in some of my money at the same time (June of 2012), she would have a networth that would far exceed my own.  Originally, I was thinking about keeping all her bitcoins in there until she was 18years old because I didn't expect to see this increase in value for at least a few years....but now I might buy her a piece of real estate, rent it out, have her manage it and the rental income be her allowance...maybe when she is 7.  Thanks man, my daughter is only 3 years old now, I hope she will learn the lessons I have learned much like your son.
