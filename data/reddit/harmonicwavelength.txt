It isn't at the point of being a household term yet. Give it another year or two before we can expect the above.

Yeah but he hasn't answered back and I'm fixing to go to bed.

At the turn of the new year 1 Bitcoin is not worth $10,000.00.
But that could be a true statement that she made in the not too distant future.
Predictions on when Bitcoin hits $10,000?

Sebuh is a really cool guy. I'm more interested in getting into mining now after seeing this.

Is this the same service that Stephanie from Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast was mentioning? Or was it Adam who got the coins back? Anyways some guy named Dave cracked the password with Stephanie's help and her best input on what she thought her password was, and the coins were recovered! Brilliant service.

I looked up you're profile and you seem like someone who does support Bitcoin so I don't want to get into a duel with you. I think the Bitcoin Billboards Team are spreading the word on Bitcoin and more people are learing about it and getting interested in it as a result.
Are you interested in massive widespread adoption of Bitcoin? If so what kind of input or ideas do you have to further this growth? That's not a challenge. I'm earnestly asking.

If they get in now by the time they're 18 they could be knowing the good life.

TheMonkeyMind, if you want to step on Bitcoin, keep spewing lava. Are you a Bitcoin proponent or do you work for Chase?
Otherwise check this out for the answer to your question:

rrtson, sorry for overwhelming your infantile mind.
You go back to your cartoons and Lucky Charms if you're old enough to be eating those, while the grown-ups discus Bitcoin and the future.

Arise Bitcoin Team is awesome for spreading the word on Bitcoin. I'm going to send them some bits the next time I'm logged into Coinbase.
Edit: Okay I put my bitcoin where my mouth was and sent them 3 1/2 millibits. Here's their wallet address if you want to support them and help Bitcoin expand: 1NHcECfk8oxJe83m9bPME2cdUCY72vuA2Y

What's your wallet address?

Funny since I actually fit into this majority category as described in the article. So I can't argue it. Ladies, care to join the Bitcoin world and even-up the demographics? (If this report is even accurate.)

I think that would be a great new billboard for Bitcoin: "What is Bitcoin?"
I think this one is good because it puts Bitcoin into the mainstream line of sight. There are 30 billboards up in LA all over the city, and it at least gets people curious to find out what's up.
By the end of the interview Juma was very interested and he wanted to check it out. That is a good thing for the growth of the Bitcoin revolution.
I want to see a lot more of these all over.

This is a valid question and so I will give my answer for it.
If Bitcoin 100% succeeds then I would say that any time is good to buy. Even if it had leveled out at $30,000 you still have population increase and productivity increase on a planet-wide level so the value will still continue to go up just from that alone.

Based on Chris Dixon's estimate of the future value of Bitcoin, the Winklevi were low-balling it at $40,000 each.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:40:25
Right on. Yeah I donated too. And that's a great idea to expand on new and/or better ways of promoting Bitcoin and bring new ideas to the table!
There's a meetup in LA tomorrow with Andreas Antonopoulos and others.

Apple and many others are watching this. It's called making your voice heard. And I approve 100%
Apple is smothering new technology (trying to but it will recoil on them hard). They've turned down a dark road that will not end well for them. And who's on their Board of Directors? How about Al Gore himself! Criminal, Charlatan and Quack in Chief who delights in backstabbing his fellow man.

I really like this 6 min interview with the guy from Africa at the LA Bitcoin billboard on Fairfax. He poses some valid questions and he seems like a pretty smart guy. Hope he does look into BTC.

The guy that posted this has been a user for a year. 
Also, if you search twitter "bitcoin billboards" in the search bar, people are mentioning it there too. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:41:18
I agree this is TOO freakin cool! I saw one of those same billboards when I was driving today and saw one in the Atwater Village area, on Glendale Blvd. For those that arent familiar with this area its between Hollywood and Glendale area in Los Angeles. I'll try to take a pic of it when I get a chance. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:51:32
I saw one in Atwater Village, on Glendale Blvd. There was another post yesterday where a guy said he saw one on Hollywood and Hillhurst and  another somwhere on Sunset. Then there is this post regarding the one in Eaglerock:  Dont know of any others.

I don't see this as an advertisement for anything but the Bitcoin itself. This shows the world that any enterprising, independent individual can have a voice and with this campaign can demonstrate the power of the Bitcoin. Any individual can send money in any amount and at relatively lightning speed and doesn't have to rely on Mastercard, Visa, American Express or PayPal. 
I would much rather see an individual, "indy" message from one of the people on the ground than a corporate billboard from Chase or Bank of America. They've held a huge amount of undue power for long enough. But that's the problem with our mindset in society today, we are so used to seeing corporate giants ruling the world that when something like this appears it worries some of us.
If this demonstration goes viral, even if just fractional amounts of bitcoin are sent it proves the power of the Bitcoin and everyone can see it happening. It shows that these former financial monopoly holders no longer have the strangle-hold upon us that they have enjoyed for so long. I love this billboard idea. If anyone is pro-bitcoin I would say this is another cool new thing that people are seeing on the street and raises interest and awareness of our future currency. It's already attracting a fair amount of attention and these just started appearing about 2 days ago.

I posted this in another thread so I apologize for repeating myself here but I wanted to put this out there.

1.) Bitcoin is decentralized, so its the people backing it up. Its not any government or bank. But that is what most people like about it because it isnt controlled by any one group.
2.) Im not sure which companies are on the fortune 500. But some Subways in Los Angeles (where I live) are accepting Bitcoin. Its mostly accepted on the internet.
3.) Yes, you can cash out. It just depends what exchange you use. Coinbase is good for US users but not sure where you are or where you want to use Bitcoins.
Hope this helps.

Nope sorry. Several posts now confirming these are real. If I hadnt seen it with my own eyes though, I might think the same.
