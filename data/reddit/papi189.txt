I’m smart enough to get straight As without going to class regularly ��  when you think about it, though, life itself is a gamble. Nothing is guaranteed! I know quite a few people who became rich off crypto

Hahaha let’s make that money

Please explain

I can always graduate a semester late, if things don’t work out as planned.

I’m just gonna dive into it ����

I’m not using borrowed money, thankfully! All my tuition is paid out of pocket, no student loans. Thanks for the luck, I’ll definitely need it.

Highly considering it

The whole education system is a gamble! Think about it man. It doesn’t guarantee you success, all they do is teach you how to be a good employee, instead of how to create jobs. Most college grads barely make 100k a year lol

But there is a very high chance that my college degree will not grant me high margins ROI

Well, first of all, I don’t think the college I go to matters, deeming that I know quite a few kids who went to prestigious schools like Princeton and Columbia but are currently struggling to even obtain financial freedom. They wish they had invested their tuition ($100K+) into bitcoin (instead) as the probability of them getting a higher ROI would’ve been alot higher that way.
