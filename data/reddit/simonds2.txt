Here you go, article of 'De Tijd', pretty accurate:  So no taxes to pay as long as you can prove you managed it responsibly. Although 'responsibly' is open to discussion of course. Otherwise you would have to pay 33% tax. I think the best is to hire a good accountant experienced in crypto if we are talking about some big sums of money.

I was there... Some may remember me from the CC Ticker app which was basically a predecessor of the current Blockfolio app. What I do remember the weeks leading up to the bust was more and more posts of people who called the top and sold... Those posts where downvoted and ignored by many many people. There was a real high in the markets! On the lowest points in 2014-2015, the opposite was true. Some real quality posts where posted to tell people nothing was wrong with the technology and the price would certainly go higher again at a later point in time. These quality posts where upvoted massively and did keep the hope high :-) Oh yeah... And this one:

Well that should be me. Unfortunately I have not much time to work on the app at the moment. Therefore I decided to open-source it.

I'm not so sure about that... 1000 is a really low number. Personally I know 20 people (friends and family) that own cryptocurrencies. Btw, the CCTicker app also originated in Belgium :)

Epic! perfect timing! I hope it's legit and this is the new beginning of BTC :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:26:35
I'm working on such an app ;) It will be able to give you the current value of BTC and all the other major cryptocurrencies as well as calculating your total capital. Should be available within a week when it's approved by Apple.
Ohh yeah, it'll be called 'CCTicker'
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:44:18
I'll sure do!
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:51:55
Thanks, the app is brand new and published in the iStore just a couple of hours ago. Should be searchable in the iStore by tomorrow if Apple updates it's indexes ;)

You won't need to pay for it, it'll be totally free :) I love programming and cryptocurrencies so it's not an effort. However I'll include a donation address... Feel free to donate something if you like it.

Wow... if you mean: directly Bitcoin -&gt; Starbucks, than just... WOW! If you mean that there is an intermediate link between Bitcoin and Starbucks: cool :)
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:58:00
Just to let you know that the app is currently in review by Apple. Should be available soon. I'll notify you when it's available
