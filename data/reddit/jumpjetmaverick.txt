For us they are maybe around two thousand Euros per year, so not quite free, but very good education for a small amount of money compared to crazy US.

Don't. You will either be frozen or lose your money. It's not worth it, trust me.

Did you watch till the end? It's a never-ending cycle of failed attempts at on chain scaling.

Strange. Can you wire money?

Timing the markets is nearly impossible. You're competing with highly tailored trading bots who can see ten steps ahead of you. It's like trying to beat your PC at chess.

I just had to replace by fee after a transaction w/ 100 satoshis/byte didn't go through for four days. Hardly FUD. I love BTC, but widespread off-chain scaling is needed ASAP.

I'm still dubious, it just seems strange, especially to say you need a pin but it isn't working. Why do you have money sitting in a Greek bank account?

It's Russia with the free-market filter applied.

Where are they stored? I would put them in paper wallets - 1 BTC each. Generate the keys locally. If you need help, PM me.

Ah yes, the good old "I bought a bank account on some DNM and need to cash it out in a totally legit way for some magic internet money" question.
Not gonna happen bud, sorry :/.

Fucking hell - the 'only' reasons gold has worth are historical precedent, real world use in many applications, eye candy value, and scarcity. Those are a lot of good reasons.
None of those reasons include "transactability", which is the only damn thing that Bitcoin has/had going for it. If you can't use Bitcoin irl, and no one does, then it's just a bunch of ones and zeroes on a computer being used for jack shit except rampant speculation - and don't forget those digits are forkable! 
Gold can't just be split into "Gold Plus" and "Diamond Gold" and maintain the same characteristics - it's unique. Bitcoin isn't, as a result of it open-source and the ease of cloning it.

At least you'll get a x-post on ;)
