Quit his lab rat job to live off bitconnect, I assume.

Huh, TIL.
That's great, actually.

That depends, of course, on the actual block size. The point is: Yes, you could get away with doubling it, quadrupling it or whatever. BUT, you will always need to increase it further to accommodate for increasing usage. So, in a way, you are choosing to go down an insane rabbit hol. The scaling debate is more about principle. An offchain approach would be implemented once and then scale pretty much indefinitely. If anything, IMO, increasing the block size should be considered as a last resort, e.g. in conjunction with an existing 2nd layer mechanism.

The block reward will decrease over time. (Halve every 4 years.) Thus, TX fees are the only long-term economic incentives for miners. Also, because the fees follow the free market, the larger the backlog of transactions, the higher the fees. This naturally leads to more miners joining in and thus reducing said backlog. If fees were constant or nonexistent, the backlog of TXs could just grow to infinity.

In very short: 
More TX per block i.e. more TPS. 
However, there will also be more data per block, i.e. you need better internet, more storage and processing power to stay liable and competitive as a network node. 
Thus, in the medium to long term, larger blocks would lead to a much lower number of eligible network participants. You could call that an increasing level of centralization. 
Now, while more TPS is certainly required for BTC to become widely adopted as a means of payment, I personally do believe that offchain approaches like LN are the way to go, because they essentially circumvent the increased hardware requirements.

Depends whether you want them to run a full LN node or whether a light wallet is sufficient for them. If the latter is the case, they would literally only need the eclair Android app for example. However, lightning is still far from a full release, so some hiccups would be expected.
