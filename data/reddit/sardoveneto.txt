Im 21 and im on ur same boat. But go easy on them, they cant grasp the tecnology behind blockchain alone. The whole economy of cryptos is too much.
So get a bank account and do ur things for urself. They say that for you, their intention are good and let's be honest there is a chance they are right
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:45:40
I understand infact to me ethereum monero and litecoin seems promising but meh i read that the real gain is in the 0.xx alt coins.
I need to learn more
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:06:46
Lmao litecoin

The problem arise when multiples holders start to sell and people panick.
Tulips in holland failed for that reason i believe
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:21:22
Fuck this im buying 30 euors of bitcoin and gg
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:08:41
35k the s model
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:19
Well they dont if u sell to coinbase they dont become sold immediadly. Someone has to buy them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:59:27
Are you telling me coinbase will cash you out 1 million euros?
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:29:41
Im a noob in economy but i mean..you cant get 2933883 bitcoin like they did with tulips in holland by planting a lot with seeds...there is a limited amount of btc...plus every coin has an intrinsex value from miners that spend a lot of money buying rigs and paying electric bills...no? Am i wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:42:03
Why? :o
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:56:04
Explain :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:18
The point is that that high can become higher and u will bite ur fingers anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:50:12
You are not considering how much money miners invest to get rigs for mining. That value adds up to the coin, it's not a tulip you can plant and take his seeds and planting another 10
Btw the point is not saying bitcoin is 10k or 100k worth. The point is that you have to keep hodling untill ur satisfied. I mean i have 2 bitcoin now. I want to buy a tesla. When btc will be 20 k i will cash them out
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:15:30
The problem is that i dont know where to put the rif code or end to end code because my bank require his fiscal code too
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:33:16
Really? So what's the pro of buying in coinbase? Like a "user friendly" grapich?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:55:06
Use another browser 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:25:02
Jesus cristh no you dont care about removing black market with no more cash, you just know that people will spend a lot of money in a non smart way, with their phone, as credit cards already makes you do.
That's why u want  to eliminate cash.
Ah and btw europe LIVES with tax avoiding, he doesnt have a clue
