Care to explain, because I just don't seem to get it.
I buy 1 USD worth of ETH/USD. Price rises and is now worth 2 USD. I feel like the market is going down so I sell for ETH/USDT to safeguard from high fluctuations. my balance is now 2 USDT. So far so good right? 
The current balance is 2 USD worth of USDT. The only way I can cash out my 2 bucks is if someone is willing to buy my 2 USDT (open buy orders). 
I don't really see how the 'printing extra USDT' causes a price drop in ETH. I only see risks that there will be no buy orders and one will not be able to cash out again?
Where is the flaw in my reasoning? I truly am clueless :-/ copy pasta from another thread I replied on but eth or btc reasoning stays the same. I'm curious of your answer...

By making posts with such titles, people will just copy and spread this newfound (unfoundated)  knowledge in their social circles - people don't read anymore, they scan. This will harm our effort in mass adoption in my opinion.
