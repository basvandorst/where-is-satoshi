At least there are regulations coming in US. In India, the politicians are indecided on whether they are to allow crypto in this country. No talks about regulations and instead the Central Bank has barred other banks from maintaining bank account of crypto related firms thereby crippling the fiat to crypto movement.

Okay. These are Zero sum games but in theory we cannot call them. So let me explain in detail.
Suppose A buys 1 BTC when it was $0.1 and then sells it to B for $10000. So you see that value appreciation came in because B was ready to pay $10000. You say 90B thing but remember not all BTC's are sold in a single day. For the Mcap to be 200B you just need to bid for 1 BTC in terms that its value is proportional to 200B

He might have. But to gather from my experience of investing is that never ever listen to anyone's advice on price movement. Everyone in the market has his own positions and tries to move it in his favour. Afterall its a zero sum game. Your loss will make someones profit.

Yup BTCkonig that is exactly what happens in crytos, Equity and all other kinds of trading happening across the world. Its just that there are lot more complex operations going on like debt fueling that growth in value and hence it looks like its growth but it is not. Wait let me find a good article/video to share.
