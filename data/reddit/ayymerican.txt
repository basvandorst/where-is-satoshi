it's redundant for embeddings but anti-xss, ABE (similar to a firewall), and clearclick (abc.com/?go=xyz.com changes to xyz.com) are pretty useful

Seconded. [If you look at the coins with "Bitcoin" in the name, there is one clear imposter]( – BTG and BTCD logos are unique, not a blatant copy rotated a few degrees.
Reddit's code was open source which led to other boards springing up using the same underlying tech. Voat for example. However if I took the code and [made a "Reddit Talk" app with a similarly ripped off logo]( then claimed it is the *true* reddit, I would rightfully get a lot of shit for being intentionally confusing.
Before I get a "muh differences cuz reddit brand is commercial" reply, I do realize the difference. My point is, users don't care about copyright. If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, claims it is the true duck, but is really a possum wearing a duck suit, people who want a duck will be pissed.
