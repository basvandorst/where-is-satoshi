The whole bch scaling saga of 2017 essentially defined Bitcoin as a "store of value" first and foremost. I hate that definition. Just like gold, you could use it like money with whomever you please. But most people use it as a store of value.
I would rather ditch the aforementioned phrase and replace it with, "digital gold on a volitile logarithmic uptrend". Nothing that drops 80-90% in value every few years is a store of value.

Congrats man!
You will never have to work again.
Let me repeat. You will never have to work again.
Sell half now. After fees and taxes...900k becomes 750k let say.
Sounds like your family is living on 50-60k.
You bought at the most important time for btc. At the bottom of the bear market.it took a two/threee years for btc to shake out of the bear market after a parabolic movement. You are now at that parabolic movement again. Everyone with a brain knows the bears are coming.
Spend 60k/year for 3 years. Plus let's say you ease your spend in slightly. 180k plus 70k spending cash =$250k gone
750k-250k = $500k 
You now have half a million dollars to wait out the bear market and find a comfortable buying point well, well below here. 
Dollar cost average your entry in 2018/2019/2020 (when bear market begins to turn). You're now that novogratz whale who casually buys up all this cheap btc when everyone is broke and busted from hodling through the bear market.
You will never have to work again. But it sounds like you want to, so go for it.

Oh shit! You're right. Coinbase has been reliable and consistent, now that you mention it. 
Nice correlation spot there!

Consider this 
If you have no plans on selling in this parabolic move
DO NOT tell her.
Only talk to her if the plan is selling.
It's one thing for the partner to know you've held btc this long. But it's another to spring the "oh yeah did I mention?  After soccer practice I'm getting the hard drive that has 1.8 million on it." She going to feel like you won the lottery.

Dude crypto hedge fund. My 8 year old cousin can make money in a crypto bull market. Hedge funds will wipe the floor with a basket of cryptos during a bull market and their smart enough to take profit to weather the bear market.
The only crypto hedge funds that will fail are the ones who get hacked or have their coins on exchanges that get hacked. Period.

Dude insider trading happens around the clock in crypto. It's not regulated. All the devs know when to buy more of their coin. All the people close to the devs know when to buy.

Holy shitballs this is big. 
The Arizona government was smart enough to do this.
Will they be smart to see that they weren't going to see 95% of that money anyway...and they basically have house money.
They should store all of it as a hedge and begin to build a crypto position. They will likely need it to bail their own state out for something looking (pensions, Medicaid, etc)
