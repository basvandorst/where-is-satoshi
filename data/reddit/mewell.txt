How much of yours is in Fiat?
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:35:10
I mean have you been able to create a invoice and have someone pay it? Or open a channel with someone? Or did you just send btc to it
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:34:03
they recommend sending 5-20 usd no more. You can't really get it back on chain right now so its def not a great place to store value
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:46:48
\-"there there will always be enough units for everyone to have lots"  
I would argue against this because it is possible at some point you wont be able to buy bitcoin with fiat.

Describe a reason why libra is bad? As far as I know I havent been able to read how it is going to work yet.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:20:47
I don't know what wallet you are using. TBH it sounds like you are not ready to be sending transactions if you don't know where your public key is. You need to stay on coinbase exchange until you educate yourself. Take a deep breathe and educate.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:26:55
The ledger Nano S is \~100 when I bought it. The most important thing to do with it is practice reseting it and storing your 24 word secret in a safe place because then worst case scenario you can buy a new ledger and back it up with your 24 word secret and not lose your bitcoin.

libra is the gateway drug
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:36:58
How so? Please explain. My understanding is that a "conference call" instantly lets each party know every other party's answer therefore the general is able to find the conclusion and the liar if there is one.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:13:54
Are you certain you are using Bitcoin Core and not an alt coin?
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:09:25
Idk why it went to 19K, nothing was happening then.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:50:01
Very good video, but no use of bitcoin here. When layer two is ready then everyday transactions will be used no doubt.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:05:27
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:39:27
But you didn't want to buy any when it was \~3k in December?
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:11:26
emails from who? Thats unusual to get an email about bitcoin transaction.  Are you withdrawing from an exchange?
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:22:24
I hate this
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:25:27
Exodus wallet is a great recommendation.  With Exodus you own your keys.   
Also Coinbase Pro is another great recommendation, because the fees are free to withdraw to a wallet and lower for trading, but I wouldn't recommend daily trading bitcoin because its so volatile.
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:40:53
There is an entirely other layer which is made up of a network of many networks. Research LApps. They will inherit from bitcoin and be useless without it.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:29:06
You got royally ripped off.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:39:45
This is extremely experimental. Do not send bitcoin you are willing to lose. Also if you don't know what you are doing dont bother using this, go learn the testnet and play with that.

Imagine a conference call with all the generals. Problem solved.
Source: I am a General and I have a computer.
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:41:56
You can buy fractions of a bitcoin. For example a "satoshi" is one of the smallest units at  0.00000001 BTC. Great question! Also there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and some have been lost forever. Best of luck.
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:23:49
"Just ignore him he's a libra" That was funny
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:53:32
realistically anywhere from 2K to 200K but prob closer to 2K than 200K
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:51:02
I'll buy your coins

Has anyone been able to receive any sats on the lightning labs wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:36:00
Yes but they can't.
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:43:09
yea it will go to 8300, but you wont buy it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:33:34
Wow that was actually the bottom
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:04:46
"you’ll have needed to solve the byzantine generals problems before you can use this hypothetical conference call solution.. to the byzantine generals problem."  
I don't need to solve the problem... there is a fault tolerance. If 1/3 general is lying then no solution exists less than or equal to 2/3 generals are loyal.   
If we were on a conference call then just like the Byzantine fault tolerance problem, the generals would all know everybody answer and the bad actor would be found.
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:47:57
sure, if it goes to 8300 you should just hodl through it imo.
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:04:19
$8300 actually
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:19:16
oh well hopefully you didnt send more than you were willing to lose. RN there is no way to get it back on chain. unless maybe you ran a full node and open channels with a couple hubs which costs a great deal...
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:41:11
you had confirmation? Are you sure?
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:15:04
no wait I think this guy can read the markets like a book, he must know where the price is going...
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:50:01
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:04:42
Honestly I want to give you my best answer because you seem serious so I will tell you that it could go up or down.
@_date: 2019-06-15 13:23:15
well today generals can use computers to send messages, but yes good job.
@_date: 2019-06-01 00:52:19
Aint no one know that.

lol weak hands
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:06:22
what about when it goes to 8300... wha hahahahaha
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:37:09
I think\*\*\* you should close it, unless watchtower is enabled. But I am still learning about lightning.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:22:43


Coinbase is great, but a great quote from Andreas Antonopoulos(A great mind in the space who helps spread correct information) said "Not your keys, not your bitcoin". But Coinbase makes sense for beginners, because its more common to lose your bitcoin from mistakes than from scams. It seems like all these replies are good and honest, from what I have read so far. best of luck! And hodl!!
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:27:49
Bitcoin doesnt go missing.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:39:26
I hate to say it, but the nefarious actor could be Apple. You really shouldn't use that as a wallet on an OS you don't 'own'.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:29:36
what kind of network fee did you use? What sat per byte?
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:38:09
I don't think thats how it works
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:48:06
I don't mind it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:09:25
you can look that up on coinmarketcap. $150B interesting that the marketcap is $154B today
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:33:09
I'll be honest. I don't know. But When they unfreeze Hal you should ask him.

It might go up, down, stay the same, but it will not go left.
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:19:26
Of course its risky. Hot wallets are risky and Lightning is as hot as it gets.
@_date: 2019-05-28 04:55:03
if you truly believe in bitcoin for the long term. then you can buy in when its on sale and takes profits whenever you want
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:54:28
I think 8300 is a fair price.. 20k is a bit high
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:57:00
[  
If and when 8300 is broken I stop buying and let it ride.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:36:34
8300 is a hard line to pass... if it can hold at 8300 that would be healthy
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:05:28
is that it?
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:44:00
I like 8300 in the next couple weeks. But I will wait for $20,000 to buy.
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:00:25
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:01:37
you can buy fractions of a penny. The smallest denomination of a bitcoin is a satoshi at **0.00000001 of a bitcoin**
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:10:16
6,000 - 8,300 - 12,000
8300 will be an interesting battle
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:46:40
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:53:30
Bitcoin is software. Change my mind.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:30:16
You could make a simple app like this without much time. A great opportunity to learn a bit of code :D Maybe work with a bitcoin price website api. I hope you do, then post it!
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:40:30
well he deleted his comment. I was curious why that user thought it wasn't software.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:14:23
If it goes to 8,300 and keeps going up then I think it will be higher then 8,301, But if it goes down I think it will go down. It might go up or down or stay the same but it won't left.
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:51:14
Yea I think buying it under 8300 is good and selling around 12k prob what I'll do unless its jumps to 20k in 2 months like 2017
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:10:17
Most likely because he didn't know what it means... [
