It means someone had a large open order to purchase coins at this "lower" price, and enough people thought "sure I'll give you my btc at that price". You can think of it as a floor, and BTC went through the floor.

I think OP is just talking about in the past week, not in the future.

It is an interesting topic and basically if you don't have tools at the ready to "know" that you are accepting scammed coins you might be on the hook by government authorities for holding stolen property.

I really liked their discussion, but I thought that was a bit dishonest. With M:N mixing on the horizon/here, the block chain really does become more anonymous. Sure classic law enforcement and seizures may still be effective against people using bitcoin for money laundering, it is still a concern.

Plenty of altcoins are just digital pyramid schemes, and pyramid schemes can be stable for years and years. I still think that is a zero-sum, but the question is who knows it and who doesn't.

If you aren't interested in mainstream adoption, then sure in this speculative trading bubble it can be as fluid as you want. However we're talking about market caps already at 60+billion dollars and going to easy pass 100+ billion probably by the end of the year. People want social and market problems solved. You aren't solving anything by hard forking monthly, protocol changes biweekly, etc. I think a lot of hodlers are looking for a crypto**currency**. That means stability long term (after reaching the moon) and for them to change our culture. That won't happen with poor executions with barely understood hard forks from a macro economics perspective.   
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:16:34
BCash is nothing like a snapshot or backup, and suggesting that is either intentionally misleading or ignorant. I can create my own "fork" using a full node cut off from last week and call it AugustCoin, slightly modify the hash to invalidate blocks from this week, and re-upload a mining and node client and it would be a better "backup" than bcash at the moment.
Your point 2 is also bunk, the evil miners ASIC boost bug was FIXED in the BTC chain. That was a 8 month endless bickering of ignorance on this forum and the internet. BCH was sour over this for a long time, driving them to create a fork before it was fixed. So don't pretend they are doing a favor by forking BTC and letting BCH miners still run ASIC boost again, they were literally kicked off the chain for that behavior.
IMO it does weaken cryptocurrency to make a hard fork over such FUD of a protocol change. It was desperate and ill-timed. We'll see what other changes BCH has in mind going forward, but diluting markets and creating market confusion is a solid mark in the CON column and much more important than your 1,2,3. So don't pretend like it doesn't matter, because these hard forks do impact the crypto community.
I am more concerned about the Segwit2X hard fork than BCH, because there was a lot of corporate backing at the NYC meeting. Altcoins are altcoins and BCH never had in mind that they would usurp BTC and take over the market of payment processing due to their removing of transaction replay. That was very important to be added, and BCH did this immediately (credit to them). 
Payment processing companies and exchanges seem to not be able to keep up with dishonest actors and that WILL have a real impact on where btc vs btc1 will be usable to buy goods and services. That is a real threat to market demand, and they seem to be planning to allow for replay, and this will be devastating.

Their cold storage security measures include large time delays. They send you emails every 6 to 8 hours saying, you sure? You sure? You sure? So you can cancel the transaction at any point in case it isn't authentic. It's called cold storage got a reason, not mild storage.

Forks are not created equal. When forks don't have replay protection they can cause real problems for people trying to use  one of the chains as a currency. For holderS, sure fork as much as you want. But as a user of a currency, unplanned and sloppy forks risk disrupting the market and could reduce wider adoption long term, which isn't good for hodlers either.

I see a lot of responses to you but thought I might add some points to maybe clear up the confusion. Basically cryptocurrencies are ledgers, or lists of transactions. There will be a hard fork where one ledger (Bitcoin) is split into two (Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash). When you keep money with Coinbase you are at their mercy which ledger their software will work with because they don't show you the private keys that let you post transactions to the ledger. When you take money out of Coinbase, they will pull it from their "databases" and it will disappear from your "Coinbase" account.
Coinbase has your money, so they get to decide if that money can be moved on one ledger or both. They have publicly stated they have no interest in this second Bitcoin cash ledger and their systems won't work on it. So that means you would only get to take money out onto the Bitcoin ledger, but Coinbase would still have those original private keys from before the fork. If the market next week decides "sure we think Bitcoin cash is worth $150", Coinbase may decide to cash in on that at YOUR expense and you would have no say in the matter.
So the advice right now is get the coins out of these "exchange accounts", and make sure you own the coins on both ledgers before they split. Nobody knows where Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash are going, and it may be only people that trade quickly will actually make any money from Bitcoin cash. But make sure you are in the driver's seat and not an exchange and their shitty software.

You seem to have missed out on the drama that was the discovery of Jihan mining empty blocks intentionally for reasons of getting an advantage in the hashing protocol at the detrament of the network and advantage of Jihan's ASICs. A bug that was to be fixed by Segwit alongside the addition of the lightning network. You seem to think everyone is an honest actor and you'd be wrong. A larger block size is not needed right now, this is pretty clear. Some calculations indicate going to a larger block size right now might mean every coffee IS recorded for two or three years before the block chain collapses under its own weight. So maybe do some additional research instead of telling people they just aren't listening to each other.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:05:35
No, it means the difficulty rate will drop and people can start using their CPUs for mining again (/s). A hard fork is at the block level.

Or if the hash rate goes down that just means people are not as interested in trying to earn the block reward and fees. That could have a correlation to the value of the digital, deflationary, decentralized asset, or it could not. We have no clue since it is not the case and has never been seen before. The hash rate just needs to be high enough to protect against a hard fork attack. Higher than that really doesn't do anything other than force folks to have higher electric bills.
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:24:28
Well this was an unfortunate thread to fine. Ignore the nay-sayer, you asked reasonable questions and I don't have answers immediately but may be able to give you some insight.
First of all Bitcoin has a public repository on GitHub. This Publix repository has branches and anyone can ask for their code to be merged into the project in a public process. The Bitcoin Depot has a public document with the expectations to be followed for code to get moved into the master branch (you can read about it here  but it is only just a document on how the organization wants to conduct itself.
Now your question about WHO gets to decide. I don't know! I don't immediately see a list of access rights for a project. I can at least say that the users that show up as doing the merging for pull requests do have write access. So essentially those are the people putting the code in. However if they process in their contributing outline is followed, they would have had code review and discussions in the public platform beforehand.
However that is only half the picture. The second half is how the code from GitHub gets put into a package that get distributed to the community. The code is built for different target platforms and a hash number is created for the resulting binary that is provided with the downloadable executable. This number can be cross checked by anyone interested in validating that the built binary is matching their own result from cloning the code and building it in the same way.
So when there is talk about Segwit2X, the means that this takes effect is someone cloning the depot and making modifications or writing code from scratch. People would have to find this out and download the executable to run their modified version. So what the other guy was saying, there is no "governance" of Bitcoin. Anyone can write any code or fork any code and run the result. However part of the big drama around the hard fork is because core has demonstrated reasonable processes for managing new ideas, being open to discussion, etc. Switching to another branch means a lot of people would be downloading from another depot, and that kind of consensus is difficult to switch back and forth without all hell breaking loose. So some concrete decisions need to be made; whose code should you run?
Hope this addresses at least partial parts of your questions.

There is no replay protection so there will be no choice to sell a post fork coin and buy the main chain. It won't be like that BCH hardfork. There is a battle for the Bitcoin protocol, and abstaining is letting others decide. If you don't care that is fine, but don't mistake inaction for action. I will be telling Coinbase that they will have lost all my future business with them if they go S2X.

If you think we will have a hard fork to add in features that Monero has, you're not paying close enough attention to the last two "hard fork" scares. Bitcoin has a purpose being the first, but many altcoins do have technical advantages, whether or not you care to find out.
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:22:40
Firing just colloquially means the de facto binary blob used by the community/ecosystem will be coming from a different repository controlled by different people. Core could of course clone the Segwit2X branch and start working off that to remain at the helm so to say, if the community agrees with that to use their stuff. But the bigger issues is ignoring the reasonable processes core has followed for years now and has helped get us to where we are at, as well as all of the poor arguments from the 2x side.

Why wouldn't you have already moved coins off of exchanges? And why would you wait to the third if the result you are expecting is for them to not have your crypto at that time? I feel like I must be missing something or this is a very stupid idea. Is this for traders and not hodlers?

Finally got myself some part of a coin. Can't believe how easy Coinbase made it. I really should have done this years ago (oops).

This may be [relevant]( as far as destroying HDD's with magnets doesn't go. What size magnet was it? It would have to be a giant electromagnet.

Maybe try smaller denominations? I gave my siblings 15 mBTC (partially because I don't have a lot) and they weren't sure what to do with it. I told them to hold onto it and see what 2014 has to offer. They should start seeing the logo popping up more often.

In the year 3000, there will be no scams with bitcoin.

Sounds like an interesting idea. Here are my quick thoughts:
There are [tons of distributed computing projects]( that people sign up for for free just to help out. Are you suggesting people running a Bitcoin stack make up a larger volume of computing power?
CPU's are slow. They are slow for mining and they will be slow for research. It sounds like you should be saying "ASICs are taking over, we need to go back to just general computing and figure out a way to make money off of this hardware we have."
What is the market size of researchers needing more computational power than they can get from spawning Amazon's services, etc.?
None of this is Bitcoin related (as per the list above). What you are really suggesting is turn the Bitcoin community into a distributed computing community, and the incentive is that they will get paid in Bitcoins for their services. They could also get paid in Paypal, check, etc. Bitcoin is just way more convenient, but nothing about it is central to the work being done here.
Just some thoughts I had. Good luck! I think the biggest hitch will be having academics purchasing Bitcoins to pay for services. If you can do that, well... fuck yeah then. Budgets are pretty rigid, as is the exchange of money for services and goods. I will be sure to keep this in mind for any computational stuff I have in the future.

Indeed doesn't this mean I should fire up my GPU and start mining the core chain in a month? The hash rate graph is going to look VERY entertaining.

That would be a pretty good ad. Whipping quarters across the internet at people/projects. Then you swap in bitcoins with an account going up and transactions list growing.

There will be a global internet username clearing in 2020, dubbed the purge of the century.

Maybe I'm not understanding this correctly, but if your model is way off with a minute to spare then wtf? Either it is a guaranteed win for those betting, or people bum rush it and any winnings approach nothing and nobody may even earn back the fee.

Please open up a cash only store and see how that goes. Your argument is asinine. Electronic payments are ubiquitous with modern society. A company cannot function without taking payments because it is expected that they do. Therefore there is no choice here.

Back in the hay-day we could get a buck for an mBTC. How the times have changed...
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:54:25
The more iterations you have available the closer you get to the limit. Starting at 1 mBTC give you 10 extra doubles, but then your expected payoff is really only 1 mBTC instead of 1 BTC, up until you lose it all.
