You will find a lot of negativity from here. Try to get your information from somewhere else as well before you make up your mind on what is trash and not.

i thought the hole point of bitcoin was that everyone could have a cheap alternative to send money almost instantly. not that the one who pays more gets priority.

If  can't buy coffee with it then it's not worth anything.

but they are not called a currency.

It changed from being a currency to a store of value. I got into BTC in 2012 because i thought it will be the new money where quick and simple micropayments would be possible. Screw the banks and their centralization but now the majority of people dont even see it as a currency. Its supposed to be like gold.  Yeah its worth 7000USD but unless you cash it out to fiat its worthless.

Are you allowed to talk about Altcoins now on this reddit? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:30:10
2 out of 3 dont know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:05:52
Lol, your loss.  Bitcoin cash to buy the coffee and Bitcoin as a store of value. For me i was hoping that Bitcoin would become a currency but that has changed so bitcoin cash makes more sence to me if im going to buy something.

still that fee is to much if you are going to buy a coffee.
