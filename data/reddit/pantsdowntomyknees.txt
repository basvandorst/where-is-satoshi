I don't think you understand how bitcoin works. If he gave the shop owner $200 in cash, instead of the equivalent of bitcoin at the time, the owner would have been able to pick and choose when to convert the bitcoin into cash. You are not taking into account the fact that if the owner was given fiat he could convert it into bitcoin anytime he would want to.

So if go to germany sell my bitcoin at an atm and then change my euros into usd will I be taxed?

I don't get this attitude. I want as many people to use bitcoin for whatever reason as possible.

Fiat is most defitately “real” money. Any currency that holds value is “real” money. He for sure lost value. If the board was $200 fiat and he was given in it fiat it would still be worth $200 now its worth around $180.

There is a difference between coming to an agreement and asking permission.

The fact that you have to ask your wife permission to by a bitcoin would lead me to the conclusion that you are already ball-less.
