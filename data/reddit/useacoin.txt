@_date: 2018-01-27 10:59:00
what program is this made in? its looks awesome
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:11:14
I didn't since I asked lol, computers are constantly getting better. Our computers are not even comparable to whats going to come in the future, but I see for now there is no worry
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:09:09
Yea thats true, but on those kind of accounts you only have a couple of tries before the account gets locked. However, I see how small the odds are of breaking a wallet the way i proposed
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:09:58
Wow that's crazy the second article u linked lmao
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:21
hey lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:55:33
Okay thanks everybody
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:18:51
well my pile is more a one coin kind of pile, where the coin is actually a very small fraction but one can wish :)

Interesting to see countries that actually really need this new technology right now. Most of us are just very impressed and fascinated by the technology, not in desperate need of it
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:56:11
Ouch, would probably have been even better if you invested back then :P
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:52:24
You just sit back and enjoy the ride, it's gonna be a wild one
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:58:17
Here is a very good thread: 
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:05:34
Interesting, I think we will see a lot more of these this year
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:13:34
Nice :)
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:27:51
Yea well you are obviously involved in this space, which most people on a global scale aren't :P
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:07:47
The plot goes deeper
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:30:43
And we hit it!
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:02:13
Gonna be exciting to see what other world leaders are going to say concerning the subject
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:23:59
Exactly, nowadays people just see a headline and take that as the whole story, they don't care what it might actually entail. All they see is google bans crypto ads, crypto must be bad. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:28:17
Still a very cheap price to get in at, big ups
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:59:46
Haha awesome keep it up ;P
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:11:30
Haha epic, well made 
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:36:00
It is great news for crypto, but unfortunately the general public/people invested with limited knowledge, will panic after seeing this so the price will most likely tank for a while :/
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:31:09
I still feel like almost everything is very correlated, but one that can contribute towards less correlation is more USD-Crypto pairings on exchanges. All the smaller coins are only paired against bitcoin and sometimes ETH, therefore if the usd value of bitcoin moves, the usd value of all the other smaller coins moves aswell. If you want to see the "actual" movement of smaller coins, choose BTC instead of USD on coinmarketcap. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:19:16
We do
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:37:03
It sure has been about to burst for a long time now :P
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:06:04
A little tip if you do get a hardware wallet - after setting up you recovery passphrase, wipe your hardware wallet completely (enter pin wrong 3 times on nano s) and then recover it from the passphrase. That at least put me even more at ease, knowing I could 100% recover my funds even if I someone lost the hardware wallet.

I play it everyday, I also start over everyday (every minute)
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:32:47
There was a guy that did this as a parody in a bitcoin song he made a while back too :P
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:38:40
yea idk
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:57:28
Awesome way to do it!
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:57:26
Hopefully Twitter will start cleaning up those crypto scams now that the CEO is gaining more interest in the subject
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:36:04
It's hard to imagine just how many people in the world aren't involved in cryptocurrencies, as most of us read about it every day.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:40:59
Another one
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:23:37
Ah so that's what happened
