@_date: 2018-01-08 23:36:24
That's doesn't sound quite right. 
The possible attack is [essentially spamming bad transactions]( to confuse exchanges, right? It's only a problem if wallets / users aren't aware of it...
If that's what you're worried about why segwit rather than hard fork which secures everyone rather than only those opting into segwit? There's also FlexTrans...

Facebook is the nicer MySpace. Which itself displaced other things now defunct. First mover advantage is one factor but there are many others.
BTC needs to evolve scaling and energy consumption problems or I believe it is in jeopardy.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:01:27
Also most are ultimately relying on banks to get fiat in and out of the ecosystem.

Segwit isn't required for LN
Transaction malleability fix is required. I think they actually have something on their roadmap for that... 
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:43:41
Hassle free?
You know that the CRA expects you to report capital gains / losses on every BTC transaction, right?  :(
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:22:56
Yup, that's a fair viewpoint and well explained. Thanks for the civilized debate!
I completely disagree about the centralization bit but now we're far off topic.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:14:17
Segwit wasn't. Transaction malleability change was ... kind of ...

Huh?! I have BTC, BCH, and many other holdings. I hold in proportion to market cap, so I'm heaviest in BTC.
I'm just pointing out that core doesn't want to scale via blocksize. Shaming coinbase for not rushing to increase blocksize via segwit seems ass backwards. You should be thirsty for lighting or other off chain solutions, and shaming the speed of progress there if you're frustrated with fees in BTC land.
If you think 1%s are messing with BTC fees that's a problem with BTC itself, nothing to do with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:12:25
I think you're talking about 'tabs'
As in, trusting a 3rd party to hold your money and track your transactions.
That's not what LN is about, and you can do that today without LN.
BTC is trustless peer-to-peer. There are a lot of the players in the trusted payment processing space already!! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:24:08
No, this thread (and many like it) are full of people shaming places like Coinbase for not supporting segwit. Why? Not because they can use lightning or any other benefit, but because they want to shove more transactions into a block to improve throughput and decrease fees.
The same population that wildly campaigned against any blocksize increase because "you can't scale on chain"
Some core members have said they would prefer even smaller blocks!! 
Instead of putting this all together, they shout at Coinbase (probably one of the largest drivers of BTC adoption) to "use segwit" even before the reference implementation. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:07:22
I really don't believe that big blocks and decentralization are 1:1 correlated. There are a LOT of forces in the free market that push towards centralization / efficiencies of scale, and we've been stalled at 1mb for a looong time now.
To be viable LN needs larger blocks too.
Sticking your head in sand and ignoring all the other ways transaction throughout is being tackled is a very dangerous attitude, especially when LN is really unproven (from an adoption by user point of view, even assuming all the technical bits are perfect and ready today.) Have you read the XRB white paper? Really interesting and easy read.
For me, time to take my BTC profits in cash and watch from the sidelines for a bit. If any kind of scaling solution shows up, I'm sure I can jump back in quicker than the masses, still holding a few other cryptos...

Coffee costs a dollar, plus tax is $1.25.
I hand them a $5. Now I have stupid coins to deal with. If I brought the wrong currency, the vendor won't accept it. If it turns out the coffee is amazing and I want to buy a giant bag of the beans, unless I thought to bring enough currency with me, I'm out of luck. The more currency I bring with me, the greater the loss if I lose my wallet, get mugged, etc ..
Digital: 
My VISA is linked to my phone's NFC. I always carry my phone. I tap to pay for the exact amount of the coffee, I get a 2% bonus, and my transaction is logged so I can easily see now much I spend on coffee a year, if I care. If I lose my phone, I don't lose my money.
So: why pay with cash????

You don't think a different group benefits from a very small on-chain tx limit?
Crypto is cool because it's trustless - you're supposed to assume people are greedy.

My other wish is for all "hodl"-type spam posts to disappear (from both subs)
We're all here because we're interested in Bitcoin. I really don't need hundreds of threads and comments that tell everyone to never use but always purchase BTC. I doubt anyone else does either, but I guess a circlejerk is fun for some.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:42:18
It's just a different type of centralization we're worried about. Economies of scale will always centralize mining efforts, and decentralized nodes that are not mining don't affect consensus. Do you think 1mb cap really affects where mining power lives? Why not back a POS fork/coin if that's the main concern? 
2mb is not going to affect who can run a meaningful node. Capping the transaction rate artificially low when there is no scaling solution off chain ready is frustrating. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:09:25
Well I'm critical of 2X too, that's how I entered this thread. That's not what I'm saying in the post you replied to though, I think you missed my point!
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:08:24
Start adding transactions on another chain? Yes, that will definitely show *them* !
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:57:58
The gps works because it has a map of every possible route between your starting point and your destination.
The equivalent would be bringing your gps to a foreign country, and with no prior knowledge, it providing directions. 
Not the same problem. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:17:14
So if the problem is solved what do you think the developers are working on ?
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:20:51
The point of Lightning is to do away with the map - if each node knows the entire state of map, there is no scaling advantage compared to traditional blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:37:41
Oh sorry - then I'll comment on this part:


No - that data is NOT available in lightning. Every single LN transaction changes the routes available. A node can change their fees at any time. You need to route with imperfect data for LN to work. 
Or all you've done is reintroduce the same scaling problems (everyone must know about every transaction.)
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:38:17
Yes that's the map but keep in mind LN needs to be different than blockchain; you can't send every transaction (route change) to every host or you're not doing anything Bitcoin isn't doing already. 


Yes fair nitpick - the important difference is that the GPS has the map up front. The magic for LN is getting you somewhere without the map.
The 'math' is completely different. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:11:35
So bigger blocks = more transactions. Who would have guessed!?
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:36:15
You cut out the point that the developer was making in a thread where you asked for proof a dev was saying this...
Let me interpret his point of view for you: they don't feel they are at a point where they are READY to commit to something 100% forward compatible. If they find a large bug, performance, usability improvement that requires breaking backwards compatibility (and there are definitely legitimate examples where a developer will need to purposefully break compatibility to achieve a greater goal) they might not be unable to do so if people tied up real money against their instructions.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:31:21
You said




No - it's not the same problem that lightning needs to solve and the math / routing problems are completely different.
Central server: Give me the whole map so I can make an optimal routing decision
Mesh: here's a message and a set of rules that we have to obey while passing messages. Help me route to the correct destination. We need to carefully limit the amount of bandwidth required per node or else scaling falls over ...
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:01:00
Yes I mostly agree, that statement is accurate. This is the problem that is not yet solved - how to provide those useful but limited sized routing tables with a reasonable amount of bandwidth. 
The problem becomes more difficult if the goal is to avoid a hub and spoke network with centralized nodes (eg: users must open a channel to a large, relatively static node that maintains large open channels to a few other big nodes and those routes are well known. Aka BGP) 
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:41:49
Because to build a map of Lightning you need to know all of the channel states. Per a LN dev, for a million nodes that map will require 113GB / day of bandwidth. 
So to my original point: it's not just a 'find a route given you know all the paths' problem -  it's a 'how to route without needing the whole map' problem.
Lightning is a whole different ballgame than GPS navigation. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:05:05
Gotcha. It's not that you didn't read or understand what the developers are saying, you just disagree. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:48:39
I'd argue that support of both chains is a feature you should desire ...
Also, in case you didn't know, it's free to fund a gdax account from your coinbase account. It's also free to send bitcoin from gdax to any address. So in fact, coinbase will actually pay the miner/transfer fee for you.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:10:14








@_date: 2017-10-30 22:27:56
The transfer from gdax -&gt; external wallet is on chain with no fee (paid by you)

Bitcoin is new and exciting because it's outside of political / centralized control.

Ledger *is* public, but there is a difference. 
Traditional banking requires you to identify yourself to open an account. Anyone can open an anonymous crypto account, broadcast a public address, accept money, and if no money is spent: you could never identify the owner.
This is why governments are so interested in policing the fiat gateways..  And why those typically force you to identify yourself ...

Welcome to the free market.
Efficiencies of scale are rewarded, as is creating technology that does task X faster/cheaper/whatever.
Ask yourself what the alternative would be.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:58:26
About the opposite of status quo then. Well I think I've made my point and you've made yours. May consensus win, or something like that.

You're either going to need a team of assassins OR do away with the decentralized approach, so people you don't like don't get to play.
