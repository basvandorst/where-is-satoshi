Thanks. I did try to decode the transactions I mentioned before using the tool you suggest and I can't see anything wrong with it. Any insights?

Yes I did both and carefully check the transactions before sending them. They were rightfully accepted and are visible on blockchain.info as you could see but never confirmed or were rejected. At this stage I dont know what to understand or do.

Thanks! How could my heir *easily* pay a miner in case the original mining fee is not sufficient?

1) Which software should I use (as a non-technical person) to create this signed locktime transaction that I will give to my heir?
2) How to make sure the mining fee will be enough at the time of broadcasting?
3) Why do you say "a longer time seems safer"?
