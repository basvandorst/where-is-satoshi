limbo? btc was 1k last year.
up 10k is not "limbo"
sideways trading until futures closes tomorrow or until Lunar New Year pop.

Correct LN and segwit will make transactions faster and cheaper. For example Coinbase still has not implented segwit and they do not even batch transactions. This slows down the network.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:36:30
lol bro this is still 1994 land in terms of global adoption. you need to have stronger hands.
just try to accumulate whatever you are comfortable completely losing over time.
ie throw in 100 bucks a week or whatever you are cool with losing completely. dollar cost average that shit yo.
start stacking and come back to me in a year. you will thank me.

@_date: 2018-05-29 16:48:04
Halvening not even priced in yet...
It will not begin to get priced in until early 2020.
HODL and wait for six figure bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:29:13

The HODL is strong with this one.
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:17:31
is it worth making the switch from a block chain wallet?
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:26:38
Because the 75 million these coins are worth now will easily be worth BILLIONS some day.
@_date: 2014-10-03 16:57:45
funny how we get downvoted for pointing out the obvious. 
sorry boys but 300 is imminent at this point.
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:32:47
No limit bro nobody is ever going to care
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:05:17
My personal theory is that they are waiting to buy up the auctioned coins for cheap. Then open the flood gates when they can flip all those coins.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:54:42
Thank you! Can't wait to test the site!
@_date: 2014-09-15 23:09:10

What wallet should I use then? My stomach is in pain right now as I try to load my blockchain iOS app and it just keeps giving me errors.
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:29:05
Thanks brother
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:52:49
Let's just say 24 year old you will be VERY happy 14 year old you bought some bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-06 11:40:38
Loser bots and the Chinese banning bitcoin. And people who don't think that one BTC will one day be worth $100k+
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:44:43
Me too man. I think the end of this year will be huge.

Can't upvote you enough on this. Too true my friend.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:12:46
It was good that it saved you from buying at a higher price. 
I'm thinking 350 by Friday.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:10:50
You can either sell now and  take a hit or tough it out.
You could also sell half and stick it out with the other half you still have left.
Or just weather the storm.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:51:57
Any tips would be much appreciated :) I love this community!
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:06:11
Hope you guys are ready for 350 :D
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:00:33
good point
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:04:32
most Bitcoins that will ever be in existence (21 million) /
roughly 7.2 billion people on Earth right now (a little less)
There will actually never fully be 21 million BTC because some people will ALWAYS lose their private keys. So it is actually a little less than 3%.
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:52:19
Thanks man. That plane is sick as fuccc
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:29:01

1. make vir vox account
2. deposit USD using paypal/bank account
3. buy second life coins using USD
4. convert second life coins to BTC
5. transfer BTC to wallet
took me forever to figure this out, hope it helps
