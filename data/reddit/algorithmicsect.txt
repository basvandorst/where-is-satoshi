I honestly expected this to go: "[...] I've never forgotten how much the state benefit and occasional help from charities (providing white goods, occasional Christmas presents for kids for example) kept us alive whilst I was trying to find a job that could pay the bills and feed my family back in 1998, when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table."
Anyway kudos to you, you sound like a cool dude.

So I clicked into a random point of this bogus documentary and it said "dictators of the left, Hitler, Stalin, ..."
Thank you for your comment though. It made me realise that the problem of "the right" is that they think it's all just about being right. Obviously Hitler wasn't right. Checkmate leftists \(wrongists\).
And I'm not joking, I'm actually thankful for your comment. After reading it, I checked Wikipedia for the definitions of left and right on the political spectrum, and learned a lot of stuff about the origin and history of these terms in Europe. Then comes a part about contemporary usage in the United States, that says: "The only aspect that is generally agreed upon is that they are the defining opposites of the United States political spectrum." I had suspected it, and now it's confirmed \(by the secret deepstate illuminati repto Wikipedia\). Words have no meanings for you guys and I can happily go back to not caring about whatever you say.
