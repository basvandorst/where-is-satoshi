Annnnd here comes the adjustment 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:18:03
Was thinking that drop of 217 volume was the start of an adjustment, clearly I shouldn’t become a day trader

Let’s have a marge in there somewhere

But there will always be someone on top. Otherwise we descend into communism and we know how well that worked out for Russia and Korea.

How else is it going to become mass adopted? Without approval from those at the top it wouldn’t succeed. People pay too much attention to the corporate rats.

Considering accountants are allowed to advise clients to sacrifice super in order to get a better tax refund/lower payable (Australia). I don’t see how these fuckwits on YouTube are allowed to tell people half the stuff they do.

You may have received some from the tether hack.

True, but what if it’s sole utility was to increase and maintain wealth and be a commodity that people invest in instead of cash? Gold doesn’t have a utility if it’s not in jewellery form, but it still retains a high value.

I just set up a BTCmarkets account and waiting to be verified. 
What are the rates like transfering from Coinbase to BTCmarkets? Should i go through GDAX as mentioned [HERE]( ??

Which is what bitcoin could become, I’m sure gold had a lesser value until gold rushes in America and Australia happened, which could be the equivalent to what we’re seeing today with bitcoin mining. But at the same time I could be completely wrong haha.

It’s a long term investment, not a short term thing ����

They’re Australian celebrities you twats. They also lost the password to their wallet when they bought the bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:18:59
What’s the best wallet to use in your opinion?

Invest by yourself. Never trust another place to invest your money for you.

All I have to do is invest $1 and I can ruin this

Abn is required for all sole traders. Registration for GST starts at $75k turnover.

Aram also uses it in a season 1 episode to securely transfer money from one account to another when Reddington suspects him of being the mole. He does a “quick transaction” in under a minute using bitcoin and a few other things. Very unrealistic for the time...
