Agreed. This should be a time for rejoicing as the market demand stays strong but the supply halves. 
Instead the demand is going to be choked as the premiere cryptocurrency falters beneath the weight of human corruptibility and vested interests.
The exact things it was meant to overcome and the very reasons I bought in in the first place. That alone kills satoshi's great experiment.

So it's now ok to use the blockchain for non-financial transactions?
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:21:51
I'd actually be ok with 2-4Mb. 
What concerns me more than anything is:
- stalling by the core developers and their desperation to avoid increasing the maximum blocksize
- avoidance of hard forks
- railroading of discussions on the major forums through censorship, disingenuous argumentation and a campaign of misinformation. 
I support all the technological improvements being worked on. But being worked on is not the same as being ready to deploy now in the face of full blocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:39:31
Storage space - Yes, will remain far cheaper than the size of the blockchain. Have you heard of these things called 'terabyte hard drives'?
Network speed - not now for &gt;8Mb blocks and not everywhere around the globe. This will change.
CPU - Yes. For all block sizes, for ever.
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:50:27
So why not 500kB blocks? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:11:42
By experts do you mean the core devs who have been bought and sold by blockstream or the miners who want larger blocks?

No they're not. Market share reflects utility. At the moment it's largely speculative. But remove the utility of growth and it will wither and die.

Thanks for clarifying.
With Core stalling on block growth for ages, always citing 'the miners, the miners' as their reason...it looks as though the carpet is being pulled out from beneath them.
Not only that, but history with BIP50 shows hard forks can be pushed and deployed in under 3 months, not the 6-12 that is claimed.

Actually now that I say that, even at $12 a pop pre-2013 bubble I don't believe this story. That's $36,000 this guy just chose to abandon and never follow up. 
Even at $2 around 2012 that's $6,000. 
Nope, just don't believe it.

To claim mining is decentralised is a misunderstanding at best, and a direct falsehood at worst. 
9 guys control 90% of mining power. They loan each other equipment. They talk to each other regularly. 
It is geographically decentralised but that's it. Mining is somewhere between an oligopoly and a cartel. 
Please stop pretending otherwise.

@_date: 2015-12-29 12:30:03
So why are you dictating their economics when they should be the ones to decide that for themselves?
If blocks are 4Mb and fees are lower than the subsidy, what's the problem? Why do they need to use fees to replace income?
20 years on from that point when the subsidy has dwindled is when the miners, not you, should decide what fees they want. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:37:55
Agreed on all points. 
One other issue is pretending that any changes to bitcoin risks centralising mining, when mining is already an oligopoly at best and a cartel at worst.

Just a shame analysis after spending 2 weeks talking personally to all the major miners completely disagrees with yours.

The hard fork was a change BerkeleyDB in pre-0.8 to LevelDB in 0.8. There was a problem with block validity with older clients and the network successfully hard forked again to 0.81 within 3 months. 
1. Hard forks are possible and don't take 1 year to deploy

Fine, at least I now understand your position. 
I however believe larger blocks are the solution to decentralisation. Not excessively large, but large enough to tip the scales out of favour for those behind the great firewall, allowing network incentives to take hold again and find a new game theoretical equilibrium point. 
I'm currently leaning in favour of bitcoin unlimited because it restores some of that balance to the wider network.

I'm not 13 but why would that matter? I've met some pretty smart 13-year-olds who have amazing coding skills.
I put a message in OP_RETURN. Or I tell my contact to watch for a payment to a particular address. Or I construct an address which encodes the terms of a contract.
You're just not very inventive.
So my payment of just a few cents to an address could unlock $1,000,000 in funds, or the OP_RETURN could be the hash of a contract worth $10,000,000.

You know that's not entirely true. 
It's the *equivalent* of 1.75Mb, not actually an increase to 1.75Mb. And only then if every transaction in a block is multisig **and** everyone on the network has upgraded.

So much fear mongering based upon a 100% guess. You have no proof this is what's actually going to happen, but you're so desperate to keep blocks small that you're willing to say anything to form the link between larger blocks and centralisation.

1. It might be easier to add a fee market now, but it's also entirely unnecessary while the block subsidy remains high and network effect low. 
2. A fee market need not develop with larger blocks supporting multiple low fee transactions, vs crippled blocks with a few high fee payments. 
The alternatives here really are do or die for bitcoin - keep the historic overcapacity (with your theoretical risks noted but vastly outweighed by years of practical experience of the network never having experienced an attack of the sort you propose) and keep growing, or strangle the baby in its bed.

If your definition of meritocracy is 'thanks for all you've done in the past but now we're going to ignore you'...then that's not a meritocracy and you're going to have to choose a different word.

So on one hand you say how complex these things being built are, and yet on the other these are proposed as the solutions to a very real problem facing us in the near future which could actually be solved in a far simpler way by replacing a line of code which was only ever included as a temporary measure anyway...
@_date: 2015-12-02 07:00:36
You're ignoring the fact that those 'last few successful people' are successful because of the nation from which they're hiding their fair share of tax revenues. 
Apple sucking billions from the US but hiding in Irish tax laws. Facebook and Google doing the same. 
If companies or individuals don't want to pay taxes, why not move to a society which doesn't have taxes - like Somalia or Syria? Do you know why not? Because those places are ungoverned shitholes which don't produce consumers or societies able of consuming their product - a product of the lack of functioning government. 
So these 'last successful individuals' have reaped the rewards of historically well funded and functioning governments yet now refuse to contribute to continue the same. 
Cry me a river.

My other worry is that the bitcoin world is being corrupted by the very thing it sought to avoid - people. 
Miners, core developers, other developers. All with agendas, not all public or open about them. 
Bitcoin was meant to solve the secrecy of money generation and remove power from centralised groups and redistribute it back to the users. 
Sadly that only lasted for the first few years when it was still small.

What a cock. Equating slavery with taxation. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 09:30:05
Why not 'one extra transaction per difficulty retarget'. That way the network itself has to come to consensus about the median size of a transaction over the previous 2 weeks, avoiding human politics and most of the methods of gaming the system. It also focuses on the actual measure of throughput which is numbers of completed transactions rather than bytes. 
I just want the network to solve this issue internally, in terms of a self-analysis algorithm, not through magic numbers picked by fallible and corruptible human beings. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:02:43
I don't think you've been doing much reading about this subject at all. The majority of miners are ready to go with support for bigger blocks. That will be the successful chain.

Mining need to be a competition again.

I'm so sorry, that's far more moral. 
All the stockpiled cash in the world won't heal the fractured and underfunded societies they're creating. 
If corporations and the ultra wealthy don't pay tax because they can escape it, governments have to take it from those who can't such as the middle and lower classes. 
And then we get situations where members of the middle and lower classes bitching on the internet that they're paying too much in tax. However, unlike yourself I place the blame squarely at the feet of those whose burden I am instead having to carry, rather than further excusing them from it.

Thank you for the clear explanation. First I've seen in a while. 
I am very concerned, however, by a few things:
1. I accept that if LN becomes the de facto Bitcoin 2.0, we will ideally need to settle only once in a while on chain. 
- Why do we need a fee market now?
- If it costs me $100 to settle a disputed transaction on-chain, doesn't this block anyone with low value transactions from seeking resolution?
- Where is the consensus that LN is the only valid scaling solution?
2. We are seeing blocks fill up now
- How much overcapacity do you think we need in each block for normal network functioning?
@_date: 2015-06-21 04:07:52
Exactly. Communist countries are 2nd world by definition. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:39:02

You assert large blocks = more centralisation which presumes there's a sliding scale between centralisation and decentralisation controlled by block size. 
This is not true. And we are not currently decentralised even at 1MB.

Hey, beats lying and banning. And it just wouldn't happen. One of the fundamental tenets of Bitcoin is 21M coins. The 1Mb blocksize limit is not. 
If you see no difference then I'd be very worried about your understanding of the failures of inflationary fiat currency.

I don't think you understand bitcoin. 
A wallet is just a list of private cryptographic keys which allow you to perform transactions on the blockchain. 
The blockchain is a permanent, distributed, uneraseable and uncensorable record of every transaction that has ever taken place in the bitcoin network.
Deleting the keys after the transaction is public does nothing to hide the transaction. 
Better hide those drugs waaaaay up your butt.

Even harder would be to have them successfully double spend in a real world 0-conf scenario like a coffee shop.

I just want to see blocks up to a max of 8Mb within 2 years because I think that will allow us to onboard a massive number of new users and use cases. 
Where it goes beyond there will hopefully be LN, but maybe a further interim block size max will be required to 16Mb. 
BIP101 is the only solution which meets my (personal) timescale *and* it allows for a soft-fork cap to be applied on top of the hard forked growth schedule.

Downloading a 4Mb block every 10 on broadband? No problem. 1-2mins max.
Validating 4Mb of transactions every 10 minutes? No problem - done in milliseconds to seconds. 
Saving 4Mb blocks on the node? 128Mb SD cards cost $50 and are good for 10 years at this rate. 
What sort of janky-ass, piece of shit hardware do you think nodes are running on? Not everyone wants to run a node on an old Nokia connected to a piece of string acting as an antenna from the heart of fucking Mongolia.

But here's where we have a disconnect. 
We both favour network growth, privacy, censorship resistance and decentralisation.
We also know large blocks specifically disadvantage the centralised Chinese miners due to the great firewall.
So why do you want to play directly into their hands by reducing the block size, when I want to fight them and rebalance in favour of non-China-based miners by increasing the block size maximum. 
The Chinese can mine smaller blocks under a large block hardfork but will have to accept the occasional one from a large block miner because it will still be valid. They will not be able to relay a chain built upon it locally and soon their entire chain will be orphaned because it will have less and less work done on it compared to the chain outside China.

I do remember bitcoin before blockstream. 
Unified goals
Pleasant community
Devs listening to the community
Cheap transactions
Plentiful block space to grow the ecosystem
Increasing VC investment
What benefits do you think centralisation around a single development group with obscure motives, widespread railroading of the narrative and a fractured community has brought us?
All because they need small blocks and high fees to force people off the main chain and onto their alternative solutions to make a profit for their investors.

I don't think the parameters of this thought experiment have been set correctly.
I agree a Monte Carlo simulation would provide much better information for all of us, but here's where I see the problem:
The 10 minute block interval.
What we'd actually have is 75% hash power on Mars, 25% on Earth. 22 minute round trip for information...BUT a 440 minute block interval.
The worry with China is not that they can't download an 8Mb block within 10 minutes - they can. It's that they can't download an 8Mb block within 30 seconds in order to get mining on top of it.
22*(10mins/0.5mins) = 440mins for correct scaling.
Now the scenario plays out quite differently. 
And you have to adjust the hash power percentages - it's 60% on Mars, 40% on Earth.
I agree this still leaves open selfish mining attacks, but not to the frequency or severity initially proposed.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:30:36
This is yet more fear mongering. If you're too afraid of change then bitcoin might not be for you. 
There will and must be hard forks in the future. 
Nobody using Bitcoin at present thinks it's a release-ready system - it's still very much an experiment in beta and as such it's users need to be aware of any changes coming down the line. If you choose not to update your node then you will be left behind. 
There are many examples from the computer hardware world, and I don't think there's anyone out there today saying we need to keep parallel ports and the IDE bus in every computer...just in case a minority don't know to upgrade. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:08:43
That just doesn't reflect the reality of mining. 60%+ is geographically located within China.

The 'appeal to authority' fallacy takes the form:

Receiving a £2 coin in exchange for a coffee means you're trusting that coin is not a forgery. Until it's deposited in your bank you haven't 'really' received it. 
But you know what, we go around and act as though this isn't the case every single day. I'll even re-use that £2 I've received without running it through a bank first to 'confirm' it's genuine. 
This is because the 0-conf spoofing of a £2 is so costly in terms of the effort involved and the punishments that may result. 
Peter Todd has metaphorically made it far easier to make fake £2 coins, and you're saying that's not a problem.

Bitcoin could not recover from a crash to $1. People would have moved off in droves by then. 
Blockchain technology in general would survive. It can not be uninvented. 
These are two different points. You would do well not to confuse them. 
I have a lot of money invested in bitcoin. Enough to upset me if it failed but not to wipe me out - I'm not a fool. 
That is why I'm strongly in favour of the core development team being more open and honest and for less censorship of public forums - the best ideas should win, not just the ones which have been decreed from on high. 
If we're not going to see a hard fork ever then they should say. If their motive is to make bitcoin into blockstream's revenue service then they should say. If RBF is going to be compulsory in future then they should say.

The need for an external verification token such as a passport is diametrically opposed to the trust less distributed nature of bitcoin. It's a slippery slope from 'it's optional' to more widespread centralisation and control.
There's also a fundamental understanding of just how widespread passports are - fewer than 30% of US citizens hold passports, and that falls further in the poor countries of the world. 
Mike's non-solution is a call for external hooks into bitcoin, disadvantaging the billions of unbanked poor, and is a somewhat arrogantly European solution (where passport ownership is high).

Don't go putting words in my mouth. I actually believe we need to spend MORE time fixing the problems bitcoin has, particularly in the areas you address. 
You don't do that by creating yet another 'me-too' alt to prove some academically fascinating, but ultimately pointless, new aspect of cryptocurrency. Like zerocoin. 
No one who is going to end up using cryptos if they take off in a big way will give two shits about the fine difference between 'pseudonymous' and 'anonymous'. It's the geeks and hackers in the crypto world who care about this side if things, not your average truck driver who just wants to buy a cup of coffee. 
So yes we need development. Desperately more so now that bitcoin has exploded in the way it has. Not on academic problems, but on real ones that impact the future survival of bitcoin.

Now, today the price of 1 BTC is US$820. Meaning 1 mBTC is worth US$0.82, or already 20x the price of 1 mg of gold.

But this deflationary behaviour of BTC brings with it added complexities - namely, I invest $100 in Apple, 5 years later I take out $500, which is probably around $400 in real terms of the dollars I first invested due to inflation.
Now, with BTC, I invest 1 BTC but 5 years later only take out 0.1 BTC because the currency has deflated over that time. In other words, I'd have been better just holding my 1 BTC rather than investing it.

My personal feeling is that if the big holders really believe in the future success of bitcoin, they'll eventually have to start selling off their massive stockpiles for more equitable distribution.
Not to triple-digit levels, but just so that there are no trillionaires created if BTC jumps to 'moon' levels.

Indeed. Network has rate has increased by a factor of 1000 since then (15,000 GH/s to 13,000,000 GH/s) but ASICs are far more power efficient than CPU/GPUs. 
So the overall power usage is less than 1000x as much. Perhaps only 100x as much. 
But ask yourself, do you REALLY think the world needs to worry about the power consumption of a few tens of thousands more processors left running 24/7? That's about a few buses worth of Diesel engines, or maybe a few tens more cars on the road. Nothing.

MPEx (Mircea Popescu Exchange) is one of the scammiest scams in Bitcoin. Here's how it goes:
- Pay 50BTC to join the exchange. This goes to Mircea Popescu's pocket
- This lets you purchase the 4 virtual stocks listed on the exchange
- Surprise! The 4 stocks are all owned or co-owned by Mircea Popescu
- None of the stocks actually do anything in the real world
If you want to get into BTC securities, look at Havelock or Cryptostocks - these exchanges are funding businesses that are actually trying to improve the use/standing of BTC in the real world.
I'm personally interested in Crypto Financial and Neo&amp;Bee - both trying to bring BTC to general consumers through legal banking setups.

Now, I could pretend to hold viewpoint X for most of my life, quickly switching to viewpoint Y when it benefits me. 
In the same way, a node could be set up to look valid for 5 years in a row, suddenly along comes a massive transaction and the node spoofs its work, steals the money and vanishes. That's a problem we still need to solve, even with 'passport' identification...

You're just wrong on this point.

You also seem very willing to conflate max permitted blocksize with 'the definite blocksize of every block produced from this moment forwards'. They are not the same. Stop deceiving people by pretending they are.

With a 10-minute block time, zero conf transactions NEED to happen in order to allow real world purchases at everyday retailers. Either that or we start having centralised services where you pre-load an account before you can order a happy meal at McDonalds, have fees to compensate for the few who will abuse the system, or make people wait 10 minutes to buy their morning coffee before walking off. None of these alternatives are desirable.

The article says that in one fourth of a year, Belgium spent one fourth of its yearly GDP on US treasury bonds.

Belgium spent ALL of its money raised over a 3-month period on US treasury bonds.
That means no money left for healthcare, roads, military, debt repayments, local government, and everything else that the Belgian government pays for.
Belgium supposedly spent 100% of its income over those 3 months on US treasuries. This is obviously not possible, and so the question of laundering arises.

I've wondered about bitcoin loans and stock dividends for a while.
I loan you 1 BTC when it's worth $800, or invest the same in your company. 2 years later, 1 BTC is worth $8000. 
Now you only need to repay me 0.1 BTC - I'd have been 10x wealthier if I never loaned you the funds in the first place. Same for stock dividends.
We need some economic theorists to model how these things will work with an inherently deflationary financial instrument like bitcoin.

I really think it's quite damaging to these banks that we go overboard here whenever we hear things like this.
Banks are used to doing trials in secret. So be it - let them keep it on the down-low and reveal their information when they choose it. If they're using bitcoin, so much the better for the rest of us.
Just don't go screaming it from the rooftops on this board, because you WILL scare them away - internal trials don't usually attract so much publicity.
Think of it like Apple - they abandon partnerships if the partner goes out and blabs their big fat mouth off. They want to work with people who can be discreet about major financial undertakings. 
The same rule should apply to major businesses and bitcoin - let them announce it on their own good time. Don't read something into a picture secretly tweeted from a conference that was never meant to go public.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:06:12
He didn't cover that issue all that well.
I'd rather he took 10 seconds to explain the method of fraud through abusing transaction malleability:
Here's 25c, 10c and 1 dollar. I make a code to sign the transaction.
Now here's 10c, 1 dollar and 25c. The code is completely different because of the re-ordered transactions, even though the content is identical.
Mt. GOX was using the code as a unique identifier, but everyone else was actually looking at what was in the transaction. 
So 'hackers' could file both transactions at the same time, one wouldn't get accepted, and they'd call Mt. GOX and get their money refunded - actually making a 100% profit.
This isn't hacking in the traditional sense.

Ok just did. I'm typing from my phone so might flesh this out from home:
1. They don't understand ECGs very well - their images of ECGs are unfiltered and laden with artefacts
2. A single lead II ECG vector cannot give you some of the details they claim to be able to recognise (size and orientation of the heart muscle)
3. Your heart works the same as everyone else's on the planet. It has the same electrical conducting system, the same anatomy and the same transmembrane salt balances as everyone else. Even other great ape ECGs look like ours. That's how doctors can read an ECG
4. Take your pulse. Now take a deep breath in. Notice it slowing down? That's a change in the spacing of individual contractions, but the conducting pathways causing the contractions are still firing identically each time your heart beats, for your entire life. 
5. Can you recognise an individual car from its cylinder timings? Sufficiently uniquely across the entire population of cars out there?
This device is based on wishful thinking and a poor understanding of cardiology I'm afraid.

Exactly. This isn't that amazing. Workers in the UK already work under PAYE rules (Pay As You Earn).
This might seem strange to US readers but what it means is this - tax is taken from your pay automatically each month. This means you don't get the situation you do in the US with millions of people filing tax returns each year.
You only have to file a tax return if:
- You are a company director
- You are a high rate earner (earning &gt;~£45k)
- You think you owe/are owed a different amount of tax than you paid
I've filed returns every year, and had amounts from £80-£1100 in refunds due to various professional subscriptions &amp; deductions.
PAYE is a very good system. Allowing the government to seize back taxes from avoiders is not a big concern to me.

Banking in many parts of the world is just how it used to be in Europe - with physical, hard currency. 
We have the benefit of not having to keep bundles of notes in our houses or on our persons when we wish to save or transact. We have banks within a few miles reach which will give us accounts. We have police services and roads and generally functioning societies.
This is what BTC can bring to these people - more personal financial security in purely physical terms. They don't have banking access in any sense of the word, but they do have mobile phones. This is the perfect intersection for these two technologies.

You just haven't read anything by Peter Todd. He has a script that can double spend with 95% certainty.
You might have paid for a meal, but you could just walk out of the door and double spend your bitcoins, thereby stealing from them.
Money transfers can be done in bitcoin because you can wait for a certain number of confirmations. But if merchants stop trusting bitcoins, they will have to convert them back to the local currency before they can actually use them. Retail purchases are the absolute key to growing the bitcoin economy.
Do I have to connect ALL the dots for you?
Me --&gt; transfer in bitcoins --&gt; relative overseas -X-&gt; spend bitcoins locally
Me --&gt; transfer in bitcoins --&gt; relative overseas --&gt; convert back to local currency --&gt; spend locally

Just like a bunch of fucking politicians. 
"Oh, we need to wait until this sorts itself out"
"Removing a founding member would look bad to the business community"
Bullshit. A board member of the Ford motor company standing up to say that Ford cars are fundamentally flawed and that their factory will be closed for some indeterminate time would find themselves out of that directorship *very* quickly.
Would we allow army chiefs to remain in post if they denigrated the functioning of the troops under their command?

I don't believe a meltdown is coming based on a "report circulating the kremlin", I believe one is coming because of (in no particular order):
1. Massive ratio of gold futures to actual gold holdings
2. Massive world oversupply of money due to QE
3. Artificially low inflation levels to correspond with point 2
4. Massive amounts of capital stashed in tax havens
5. 3 top bankers killing themselves in as many weeks
6. Collapsing Rubles, Rupiah, Rand and Rupees as the US tapers QE
7. Poland renationalising private pensions to pay down government debt
8. USA introducing MyRA to increase public bond holdings (buying government debt with private money)
9. The European central bank paying Cypriot government debt by seizing their private money
And other points I forget at present.
If you think this leaking bucket can be fixed by current policies, you're just wrong (leaking bucket as in there's a massive hole in the bottom of our money supply with tax evasion and offshore hoardings by the ultra-wealthy, draining all the QE the government is pouring the at the top).

You claimed the acceptability of showing ID for large value transactions. I demonstrated that this was a uniquely US phenomenon. I hope you realise the market for bitcoin lies mostly outside the US. 
I also used a satirical description of a dystopian future McDonald's to illustrate where the 'papers please' ideology could take us. 
As for your point regarding Amex - no it's not widely accepted in Europe, and the reason for that is its high merchant fees.
You were making a point that having a limited pool of trusted merchant service providers would somehow be a solution. It would not. It would simply replace the current status quo of VISA/MasterCard/Amex with an alternative oligopoly of payment providers for the bitcoin world. This is unacceptable.

A big problem with anything embedded is the USB stack. It's bloody difficult to work with. I had to abandon a project that I was working on with the PIC24FJ64GB002 because EVEN WITH a built in USB controller and loads of USB tutorials it was still like reading Cyrillic.
This is also what the Trezor guys have been saying - USB is a massive PITA.

The velocity of money is *decreasing*, not increasing. 
Furthermore, nearly half of all bitcoins haven't even been created yet, so your 64% figure is a generous 32% at best. Then we need to go in to how exactly the metric was defined - did they exclude all change transactions, did they look at abandoned and lost coins?

I *really* want to see coloured coins up and running soon so that we can start to have real bitcoin stock exchanges. 
Sure, I've got a bit or two in some companies listed on havelock but get this - BTC is deflationary, meaning that I may realise real-world growth in my share value but actually get out *fewer* BTCs than I first invested.
Take a newly listed company like MS (scammy pile of crap, I know) - with 100,000 share units available, they can *never* grow beyond (21M/100,000) BTC/share. This caps the maximum potential value of any company created in the bitcoin economy. With fiat, the sky is the limit (see Berkshire Hathaway for an example). 
Furthermore, a company like Apple currently has just shy of a *billion* shares out there, worth $500 each. Even in the most wildly positive bitcoin future there would be almost no way to represent this value in BTC, unless it did become the world's money supply.
So, BTC needs coloured coins to enable secondary marketplaces, loans, securities, stocks and investments - all the things we currently need real money for.

Well, let me begin by reminding you that economics is not *actually* a science, and there are no proven or fixed laws in economics.
Yes, I am familiar with the *hypothesis* of inflation through increased money supply.
But what we have here is something different. With QE the money goes straight to the banks, who are supposed to reinvest it in the greater economy. This hasn't happened.
If, however, you were to give the money as a lump sum to random individuals across the 500,000,000 population of Europe, the money would be reinvested in local economies at a greater pace and with more targeting than the banks have done to date.

So we're going to have to do it the hard way.
QE is the central bank buying up government bonds. It's one hand paying the other, generating yet more debt which we kick down the road to future generations.
And even from Wikipedia:
Stephen Hester, chief executive officer of the RBS Group, said in an interview, "Quantitative Easing has enabled governments, this government, to run a big budget deficit without killing the economy because the Bank of England has financed it. Now you can't do that for long because people get wise to it and it causes inflation and so on, but that's what it has done: money has been printed to fund the deficit."
So who pays for all this debt that has been created?

You shouldn't commit a crime then boast about it.

The size to choose is not the problem. 
It's the division of Bitcoin users and developers into two camps
 - those who think blocks are too small now and this will hinder further growth of Bitcoin in the short term. 
- those who don't think blocks are too small and that other engineering solutions will allow Bitcoin to scale with blocks permanently kept at their current size, or slightly larger.

So what's better - downgrading nodes to relay-only without any information to the user, or completely removing that node from the network.
Which one actually serves to reinforce the network? A node that is useless is a node that is useless. If all you want are dumb relay servers, there's already infrastructure for that. If you want distributed storage, there's already infrastructure for that.
An active node on the bitcoin network needs to do more than just relay and store. It needs to secure the validity of transactions and transaction history. If you degrade its ability to do that...it's just as good as having no node there at all.
In fact it's worse - if you're hard-forked off the network you can at least find out. Particularly with a planned hard fork when the network can signal to you that it's coming.
Soft forking breaks the social contract between nodes, miners and the developers by allowing the developers to impose their will upon the network by convincing just 9 people in the world to change their software.

Add parallel blocks tethered by a merkel root in the coinbase, with its own block reward. If all miners did this it would work.

You mean they would perform exactly the same function as a node which doesn't understand SegWit if they don't upgrade to 0.12?
Relaying blocks without validation is what TCP/IP does. Soft forks reduce nodes to simple internet relay servers.
If you believe validation of transactions is an important function of the node network, you should be against soft forks.

I wish they would stop this lie that SegWit increases the maximum block size.
It doesn't. The max remains at 1MB. 
SegWit is an accounting trick to move most of the data out of the 1MB blocks into a parallel, uncounted structure.
Now...I agree with SegWit and think it's an elegant solution to some issues in bitcoin. Just not the max block size limit.

So we should never hard fork. Ever.
Keep accumulating zombie nodes. Keep accumulating coding hacks upon hacks.
Just never update.
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:48:29
So if we decrease blocks to 100k we'd have 10x the nodes? 10k blocks and we'd have 100x?
Let's do it!
After all, in your world, node count is much more important than number of users or transactions. 
And even if those nodes can't understand transactions they're receiving due to new soft forked rules, that doesn't matter! It's just the number of them existing that's important. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 11:10:27
And soft forks downgrade the functionality of nodes. A node passing around data it doesn't understand without any degree of validation defeats the underlying mechanism of distributed security.
@_date: 2016-01-09 13:28:37
You need a hard fork to raise the block size cap. The latest core dev policy states they will not use hard forks. Ergo, no increase to the block size cap.

I literally don't understand what you're asking. Do I want the network to allow blocks larger than 1MB in size? Yes. 
Who said anything about 1GB blocks? You did. You then proceeded to criticise 1GB blocks as if that was a valid argument against all block sizes greater than 1MB. That is called a straw man fallacy. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:36:40
Are all blocks made to the max block size? 
So what about this concerns you?
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:22:15
I'm not against SegWit. Why would I be?
I'm against deploying it as a passive-aggressive soft fork rather than a proper software upgrade, and I'm against it being seen as the only proximal solution to increasing transaction throughput.
You realise it's possible for people to like the ideas that come out of the core dev team whilst still disagreeing with other things they do, right?
@_date: 2016-01-09 11:27:48
1. Core will never allow hard forks
2. has shitty internet

@_date: 2016-01-09 11:07:45
So if 99% of the nodes just pass around nonsense because they can't validate it, and only 1% of nodes are actually doing validation...that's somehow OK for Bitcoin in your book?
I've said it before and I'll say it again - a Bitcoin node which doesn't speak Bitcoin is as much use to the Bitcoin network as a Dogecoin node.
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:04:39
Did they express support for larger blocks or something?
@_date: 2016-01-07 01:37:06

So he should say the 'effectively' part. And add 'temporarily' too. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 13:21:55
So catering for more transactions by increasing the block size isn't catering for more transactions?
SegWit and larger blocks are two distinct solutions and both are required to increase transaction throughput. 
Focusing on rushing the harder of the two just for ideological reasons is not good engineering. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:07:00
Agreed. I want SegWit, but I want it done right. Not with a pile of hacks just so they can avoid a (harmless) hard fork.
Those who don't hard fork will be left off the network until they do. What's actually wrong with that? 
I've never heard anyone explain why it's a bad thing to leave behind nodes which aren't actually node-ing correctly (validating and relaying). Are we so obsessed with numbers of nodes rather than their functionality?
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:22:14
God the lies you guys have to tell.
I mean, do you still believe them anymore?
- Hard forks are bad and impossible
- Node count matters more than node functionality
- SegWit will make blocks larger
- RBF improves the user experience

Increasing the limit to even 1GB right now would lead to very minimal change. Miners would choose blocks way under 1GB and nodes would carry on as normal. 
Max limit != size of every block produced

There is consensus. The lie is that there isn't consensus.
Everyone wants a block size increase except the core devs...because reasons.

And yet we still don't hear anything from the core dev team in favour of raising the block size cap. Whether or not they said '1MB forever', we have never heard anything more than BIP103...which is essentially BIP101 with a shallower gradient. 
And now we've actually got distinct evidence they're *against* raising the block size cap in the form of the scaling roadmap and the latest statement on hard vs soft forks. 
So which is it? Are they for or against a hard fork to raise the block size maximum?

Generally the problems with soft forks are as described here:
My biggest concern with soft forks is this: It tricks node operators and miners into accepting a protocol change they may disagree with but which the core developers have 'deemed' to be necessary. This places the voting capabilities of node operators and miners under the control of the developers.
But particular to the proposed SegWit soft fork:
- transactions look like 'anyonecanspend' to old nodes, meaning some will try to spend the transactions and these may in fact end up being mined. This provides an attack vector as we can no longer trust 'anyonecanspend' transactions fully, and I can lie about having the witness data and make you start to validate a constructed block full of 'anyonecanspend' transactions without matching signatures.
- it uses the coinbase transaction space which was previously reserved for miners
- it will be followed by a hard fork implementation of SegWit anyway. So...why deploy as a soft fork first?
Sounds like you're desperately trying to force a soft fork despite all the risks.
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:02:18
An economic disaster for bitcoin would be a breach of the social contract where network consensus is used to validate transactions and implement any changes. 
If people stop believing bitcoin is decentralised or functional, they'll stop using it or promoting it to their friends.

@_date: 2016-01-11 18:08:19
But they cease to function *usefully* to validate the current chain.
In which case, if we're happy to have nodes which simply relay information between each other without performing validation, we already have that - it's called the 'internet'.
If we just need nodes for storage without validation, we already have that too.
So if we're happy for the node network to be useless, then yes soft forks are great.
If we still want the node network to perform validation of transactions in order to maintain security, soft forks coded by the devs and passed to the miners without overwhelming consensus are the most passive-aggressive attack against bitcoin yet.

Soft forks are implemented through miners. You've said miners can't expand the rules. Ergo soft forks can't expand the rules...yet you then go on to say soft forked SegWit "certainly is a change to the rules."
I'll give you my concern again - "In soft forks, stakeholders don't matter and only miners do. In hard forks the whole network has to come to consensus." 
Deploying changes as soft forks is a sneaky end-run around the process of consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:19:24
We'd better not increase the block size or that might harm decentralisation. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:35:48
I support your last statement. I don't think there's a hard number we can use, but we need to be clear about that. I also don't agree miners = sole source of consensus that matters. 
And that's why I support hard forks over soft forks. Nodes decide hard forks, miners decide soft forks.

I would rephrase that as 'as the number and proportion of full validating &amp; storage network nodes declines'.
I believe there is probably a minimum number of full validating nodes required to maintain security, and a minimum proportion. This is an area ripe for research. It also explains my stance against soft forks which reduce the number and proportion of full validating nodes.

Yes, because you only have to convince 5 guys in China to switch their mining code over.
With a hard fork, you actually have to gain consensus of the majority of the network.
Guess which one makes it easier to push through controversial or unwanted changes? 
Even if there aren't any controversial changes coming now...soft forking in 42M coins would only take convincing 5 guys in China. Think about whether you'd still support soft forks over hard forks in that case?
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:47:22
Now imagine we had a network of nodes which don't understand the transactions they're seeing but simply wave them on through. This is the state of the node network after a soft fork - they cannot validate the new transactions, and they just pass them along.
Is this better or worse than having large numbers of nodes?
I think we both want the same thing - large numbers of validating nodes in diverse hands.
I believe that will come from improving the utility of the bitcoin network so that more stakeholders will be attracted. That means increasing the maximum permissible block size so that the network can handle more transactions. This makes it more useful and therefore new people will be attracted to the system.
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to think that there's a simple linear correlation between the number of nodes and the maximum permissible block size as set in software, regardless of the utility of that block size or the demand for block size and network buy-in from new users. Larger blocks = fewer nodes, smaller blocks = more nodes. You have completely discounted the historic separation of mining from the relay and validation functions of nodes and the uptake of SPV wallets. Please correct me if I'm mis-stating your position here.

Users either upgrade or remain on an alternative blockchain. If it happens to be the successful chain, so be it. That's life in the free market - anything else is a centrally-governed command economy.

It might be an improvement in scaling (better) and finally end malleability (other advantages), but in no way is it safer to deploy as a soft fork.

Implementing it as a hard fork can happen rather quickly and pretty safely.
From a design perspective, the space SW uses in the coinbase transaction is not the developers space to play with.
Why does everyone have to be ready for a hard fork to trigger? Those left behind will upgrade soon enough if they choose to do so, or they can try to form a new economic fork and see if enough people follow them. This is called 'the free market' - something soft forks destroy.
As an app designer, I hope you'd see the problem with lying to your customers by telling all those who fail to update that this transaction is something it isn't (I'm referring to pretending to non-upgraded nodes that the transaction is an 'anyonecanspend' when it's not).
The block size debate has been ham strung for well over 12 months now so we're already well into the 'eventually' stage when block size increases should have been deployed. 
Please tell me you don't think that the maximum block size permissible is equivalent to the actual block size used.

The thought I had was that you could literally be your own bank and print your own banknotes. 
Of course, the 'note' is the private key. But this requires two things - 
1. The recipient has to know that there is actually bitcoin of that value at that private key
2. That you won't just sweep the coins from that address the second your note is accepted for payment
So it would require some sort of encryption scheme which keeps the private keys hidden from both the person printing the note and the person receiving it, unless it is read and at which time it become trivially possible to demonstrate that somebody has exposed the private key. 
Maybe something like a lottery scratch card - strip away the latex to expose the private key: trivial to demonstrate it's been exposed but difficult to forge a re-application of the latex.

Game theory - miners will only mine blocks they think will be accepted by the network. 
- If they mine blocks that are too big, they risk longer transmission times, longer validation times and higher orphan rates.
- If they produce 'hostile blocks' full of transactions that take ages to validate, an alternate block to come along before validation is complete will just make you ignore the hostile one and add the new one to your chain instead.
Let miners decide on the mining stuff.

@_date: 2016-02-16 19:13:30
It's not free. You have to pay the miners to secure your transaction by proof-of-work, which requires them to burn electricity.
The miners are the ones who should control the fees, because they're the ones selling space in blocks. If they want to accept free transactions, so be it - that's their decision to make.

@_date: 2015-09-22 11:02:36
I like that idea. 
I also like the idea that if a few thousand people bought these across the world and pointed to a p2pool they could begin to beat out the mega-miners, returning bitcoin to being truly distributed.
It might only be minimally economical to run one of these at home, but due to strength in numbers it could eventually be far more economical to run a single mini miner in 10,000 locations than 10,000 mega miners in one location. 
For example - 10,000 people run their 21 machines knowing it's costing $50/year to be a part of the network. That distributed sunk/lost cost is far easier to bear on an individual scale than $500,000 lost by a single mega miner site.

I also hope LN happens, but I also hope we gave more than just LN to address scaling. 
One key aspect of scaling is larger blocks and an intelligent algorithmic solution to block size - not BIP101/100/etc which simply try to control the slope of the line. 
But for what it's worth, I support BIP101 more than the other more conservative measures being proposed right now.

Wow shit! You're literally the first person to have ever thought of that!
Except you're not. 
I could rehash many of the arguments but I'm on my phone and can't be bothered to type. 
Essentially - miners need blocks the quickest of all. They already have a dedicated backbone. And headers-first sync would sort many of these issues. And why should we all suffer due to mining companies in Tibet wth shitty internet connections?
Everyone else running a full node can survive with getting their 8Mb block inside 5 minutes. 
Plus networks around the world have been improving bandwidth by about 30%/year. 
So tell me again why 1Mb/10mins is the max bandwidth we should have in the 21st fucking century?

Now, I am an asshole. But you NEVER say that to your investors face.

The problem as I see it with Mike &amp; Gavin vs the others regarding the block size is that Mike &amp; Gavin are free from external influence driving ulterior motives.

A couple of issues here:
You realise the node doesn't know or care what the transaction was for right? Who is to say my 0.01 coffee purchase is more or less economically valid activity than transferring that to an impoverished African farmer. 
If you think you get to dictate what transactions are and are not economically valid - *ding* *ding* *ding* you may have a future in central banking and/or a financial regulatory authority.

@_date: 2015-11-28 23:59:40
Yep. I definitely want bitcoin to fail. Despite my time, effort and money invested, all I want is for banks to sweep in and take it all away. 
I definitely want to keep blocks at 1mb, to see it choke and falter as the network effect demands real growth, the. For mass panic to ensue as the core devs try to remain relevant as an alternative chain actually takes off. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:22:04
Take a look at my response to maaku7.
Please tell me how you'd actually defraud the recipient of a 0-conf transaction in the real world?
I don't mean 'I'm buying this thing from scan.co.uk' because guess what - they don't sell based on 0-conf. I'm talking about being in a shop or a bar and buying something at the till, doing something to criminally defraud the shop, and then walking away with your $5 still in your wallet instead of theirs.
How and what would you have to do to defraud them without RBF in place?
@_date: 2015-11-30 01:05:33
Ah right, so bitcoin isn't actually meant to be 'a peer-to-peer electronic cash system', like it says in the **fucking title of Satoshi's paper**.
@_date: 2015-11-26 01:28:46
Claimed to be 2%...different from it actually being 2%.

And you don't see how this refutes your 'can't store it on a personal computer' argument? 
I'll ask it another way - is your HDD larger or smaller than a USB stick?
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:06:11
So your world view is that bitcoin either remains tiny and decentralised or grows and is definitely centralised. No middle ground. Black and white, no grey.
And yet you insist we should all use centralised services **now**.
I just don't know what point you're trying to make here - centralisation is bad, but use these centralised services now because that's good. 
But growing bitcoin to accommodate everyday economic activity is bad because it will *necessarily* become centralised (according to this hand-waving evidence I've got right here) and there's no way for it to be decentralised. Which is what I want, but not if it means everyone can use it. Because then it'll be centralised. Somehow.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:11:31
At what block size does mining *necessarily* centralise?
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:29:36

@_date: 2015-11-13 01:40:40
You asked about things at node level. Don't try to move the goalposts.
And your further point again makes me ask if you actually understand the economic motivation underlying bitcoin - decentralisation is censorship-resistant.
I really cannot stress this point enough - bitcoin is electronic cash. Peer-to-peer and censorship proof.
The second you deviate from that fundamental tenet - censorship resistance of p2p value transfer through decentralisation - you're no longer talking about bitcoin.
If you try to place limits on that, and ask why a p2p transfer for purchasing X is so important then I must ask you why you even bother with bitcoin and don't just stick with fiat.
As to the larger point of decentralised layer 2 services such as the LN, the latest I've read is that even that needs larger blocks - larger even than 100Mb in size. 
So at no point in this are you justified in thinking blocks need to remain small.
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:15:44

@_date: 2015-11-29 16:46:13
Yes. FSS-RBF (first seen safe RBF, where the output has to remain the same).
But this doesn't threaten 0-conf and is therefore not suitable for forcing users to a layer 2 solution.
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:58:43

Oh you again. Great. 
Care to explain how the source of funding matters more than the ideas being espoused by the entity?
For example Microsoft and Heckler &amp; Koch are both corporate entities yet only one makes tools to kill. 
Coinbase is an exchange which could pivot from bitcoin if needed, blockstream wants everyone to leave the use of the blockchain to the biggest richest entities and shift to layer 2 technologies.

No? Then fuck you.

Thanks for the theoretical explanation. 
Now walk us through the steps of how you'd actually do it. 
1. Walk into a coffee shop. 
2. Take out phone wallet and laptop at the same time. Enter the payment address laboriously into the laptop running a double spending script. 
3. Create a transaction such that the second has a higher fee attached from the same UTXO. 
4. Broadcast simultaneously to the network on your phone and then run to your laptop and relay the second transaction. 
5. Hope that you've cheated the coffee house out of $3. 
So again, theory != practice. 
Please explain the steps you would take to cheat a 0-conf transaction in real time in a shop accepting bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-11-30 01:10:10
Wrong. Their goal is to optimise their returns however they can. If blocks remain at extremely constricted sizes then fees must grow for transactions to get processed. 
Then it's a rapid race to the bottom as either (i) bitcoin fizzles out, (ii) people move to a layer 2 settlement network, or (iii) fees skyrocket.
I don't want number (i) or (iii), and number (ii) is as real as flying pigs right now...so what do you suggest we do?
This 'fee market' is actually one of the goals of the block stream devs (for some reason I cannot fathom).
@_date: 2015-11-29 12:27:23

Imagine scientists still meeting to discuss the pre-Galilean view of the solar system. 
We could expect talks like:
Professor Barnsley believes these lunar observations perfectly match the Earth's prime position in the heavens. 
Doctor Van Schickel has produced a beautiful mathematical treatise explaining the retrogression of the outer planets
And yet the elephant in the room would be Galileo's observations and solutions to the problem. I mean, if his theories are so correct, why doesn't he present them himself? Surely he doesn't think he's in the same league as Van Schickel or Rogan, or Srinivasava? Their work over the past 200 years has conclusively demonstrated the sun orbits the Earth!
Much the same with Garzik et al and BIP101. Criticise its author rather than its content (ad hominem), talk as though we're in some theoretical alternate reality where side chains and LN are current solutions. They're not.

How about all dev work taking place in the open on a subscription-based forum. 
How about devs being paid by miners to address issues miners want sorted and nothing else. 
How about giving control of the code to the US government and all devs stepping back from work. 
How about preventing all conversations between all devs and work being coordinated entirely through coding. 
What's that - 5 different options now? How about some more. 
How about removing all devs and having code contributed only by the community. 
How about devs no longer driving any development work and only existing to service requests from the mailing list. 
So, that's 7 options now.

Here's where we face a Hearn-type 'real world grey areas' vs Core Dev 'only philosophical purity is acceptable' disagreement.
In the real world, using 0-conf for small transactions is safe enough that it's acceptable. It's not 100% secure, but neither is accepting a $20 bill.
The actual work somebody would have to do to defraud the recipient of a 0-conf transaction is non-trivial. Fine, I can sit on a laptop at home and use one of Peter Todd's scripts...but how do you propose I do that when I'm buying a beer in a bar using a phone wallet in the real world? If I defraud the bar...I'm still there 20 minutes later drinking my beer!
Can you propose a real-world case where it would be possible to successfully defraud the recipient of a 0-conf transaction? I'm genuinely interested to hear of one.

@_date: 2015-11-02 18:54:53

And do you care to explain the 'hostile' nature of this takeover? Having a vocal group with well reasoned arguments in support of increasing the block size as well as an implemented alternative client does not make the takeover 'hostile'.

One could imagine a simple 'ramp attack' to continuously displace the lowest paying transactions and bump up the minimum fee.
And if you were a miner who could profit from higher minimum fees, why wouldn't you manipulate the mempool in this way yourself?
It would be trivially easy to code and very cheap to run. 1 ramp per day until people get sick of their 'cheap' transactions not confirming and just permanently increase their fee.
Then another set of ramps to push this further. Etc. Etc.

CLTV and RBF distinctly support blockstream's interests of developing layer 2 settlement technologies. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:28:16
Because the core developers think it's more important to artificially force a fee market to develop than to increase the block size to something reasonable like 8Mb.
@_date: 2015-11-28 16:59:07
In what possible sense is XT a 'corpcoin'?
Fallacy 1 - XT is an altcoin. It's not. Same Genesis block. And at 75% majority to deploy BIP101 it would be by definition the reference client. 
Fallacy 2 - actually, just wtf do you mean to imply by the 'corporate' tag?

Because I tailor two transactions to different parts of the network - one looks like I'm paying you (low fee), the other I'm not (high fee).
Now you have to wait around for ~10 minutes to see which one gets picked up by the miners and if you actually receive your money. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:26:22
Or instead of enacting a kludge on top of another one, we agree RBF is unnecessary and increasing blocksize would make it more likely for your transaction to get included, instead of needing to create a 'fee market' at this point in bitcoin's development.

Banks and bankers want to make lots of money. Physical gold is expensive and rare. So instead they create derivative products based on real gold.
In the beginning, 1 piece of paper gold is worth 1 piece of physical gold.
However, over time the leverage increases, because hey - nobody checks to see if the real stuff backing the paper is actually there anymore.
So now the gold markets are up to 100:1 in paper to physical.
This means that if everybody who wanted to cash in their paper gold for the real stuff, 99 would go home crying and prices would shoot through the roof.
But to stop the price from rising, they play their other card and manipulate the prices down through collusion and other illegal means behind the scenes.
So they get to make money on gold without having to own the real stuff, and be in full control of the paper gold market behind the scenes.
This will happen to BTC.

Nuts. Just nuts. The idea that we need a fee market when the major revenue supporting bitcoin is currently the coinbase generation is putting the cart before the horse. You're asking fees to equal 25btc ($7,500) per block! 
A fee market cannot be forced to develop by choking any economic value out of the system in its infancy (If broadband offered 1Mb  of data every 10 minutes the internet would not be around today).
The system must grow to allow new entrants, build real-world economic value beyond speculative accumulation, and finally fees will form a growing amount of mining revenue.

This is one of the good aspects that I actually agree with - trust based banking without fees or inflationary interest charges, except here the peer-to-peer trust network is automated, robust and worldwide.
We stand to lose far more by avoiding the comparison than if we were to draw upon its similarities. Just think of the wealth in the Middle East that could flood into BTC.

Anyone know a country of residence? This is covered by clear fraud laws in MANY countries. 
Edit: What in the name of fuck? Downvoted because I reminded people that there are laws against fraud. People in this sub are getting fucking stupider each time I read it.

You know that 'nonce' is British slang for a paedophile, right? I lol'd when I got to that part.

Thank you. I hope someone with some clout takes this on board during an upcoming presentation or three.
BTC - a technological re-imagining of some of the world's oldest peer-to-peer banking traditions.

No business deserves to be protected against market forces just in case thy have to lay off some staff. This would be create government monopolies which would eventually be more harmful to innovation and the economy in general. 
So no, I don't give a shit if all the banks go bust tomorrow and we magically appear in a world of alternate currency models. Adapt your business model or die.

For my future knowledge, can I ask where you're getting the 0.5% fee for transferring into and out from BTC?

Hi Matt,
I watched the brief segment with you describing your intention to live off bitcoin over the next 12 days and hope it goes well.
I hope you can clear up a few of the misconceptions your co-hosts seemed to have, namely:
1. "Bitcoin is used for drugs and illegal weapons." 
Whilst true to a degree, by far the easiest and most widespread means of purchasing drugs and weapons is with the almighty dollar, by a factor of hundreds of millions to one.
2. "It's too volatile to use as a currency." Also rather true, but they then proceeded with the most inaccurate and harmful statement on the show "so any merchant will be stung if they accept bitcoins." 
This is just not true - multiple services (Bitpay amongst them) allow merchants to accept bitcoins and see dollars in their accounts at the end of the day minus a small fee. Buy a $3 coffee for bitcoins? Merchant gets $2.97 in their account. The daily bitcoin movement doesn't matter, and the entire float is guaranteed.
Thanks again and I hope your experiment goes well.

The US$3600 GDP/capita is anything BUT fairly distributed. You've got corrupt politicians pulling in brown envelopes of US$millions per year at one end of the scale, and a poor dude digging roads for about US$200 at the other.

I'm glad you got your issue solved, but in a different sense these kinds of problems are still worrying for the future of bitcoin. 
Imagine if VISA made your 60 year old, computer illiterate mum do what you've just done to recover some money she thought she'd sent to a friend or a different savings account etc? We'd be up in arms!
This is one major failing if BTC at this point in time - complexity for the end user. Complex to buy. Complex to transfer (what if I get one character wrong in the destination address?) and complex to spend. 
I hope one day bitcoin addresses will become as ubiquitous and straightforward as email addresses for end users, so I can confidently remember to pay my friend back for last nights drinks at: nanos.friend or send my mum a small gift at nanos.mum 
And each transaction will have fees automatically calculated etc. - end user simplicity is key!

Pay-to-enter public toilets are widespread across Europe. 
You also have to pay to watch your TV in the US, and not many people agree with the TV license over here.
But anyway, how does that relate to your bank charging you to withdraw your own money?

Explain the US then - high incomes, poor social care programmes.

I think we're going to need more details before any here can try to help you. 
Please tell us more details. Start with how did you buy and where did you buy?

The Chinese ideogram 'ma' can mean multiple things depending on tone, including 'mother' and 'horse' (or pony) - hence 'pony ma'.

Could this be rolled into the 'zSIM' concept and use an encrypted sim containing your private key so that only a physical holder of your phone could access your wallet?

In Europe it only takes minutes to transfer $1 to someone else via the bank, thanks to the faster payments scheme.

I was last there 10 years ago and the English was not 'decent' outside major tourist destinations. Even within Jakarta I'd say it would be hard to get around without some Bahasa.

Just reading the comments under that article made my brain hurt. There seems to be a lot of misinformation and mistrust in the Indian public, and it might not be that easy to clear up.

They're not stupid. People have a psychological block against dealing in non-integer currency values.
And, the world is full of billions of people like my mum, who couldn't tell you what 0.01 of 100 was if it could save her life. Yet she can easily pick out a penny and a pound from her purse.
These are the average joes who are going to make bitcoin truly successful.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:02:00
And then she actually tried to buy one, realised she had to submit documents to a faceless internet-based entity, wait a couple of weeks for approval, checked the exchange rate volatility and just gave up?
Seriously though - how do you address these very real issues when introducing new people to Bc? I bought all of mine from localbitcoins, but not without a little heartache and worry about sending large amounts of money to unknown people over the internet.

And don't forget, those widgets will be priced accordingly - i.e. if everyone is paid in BTC, the widgets will rise from 0.1 BTC in year one to 0.105 BTC in year 2.

No, but I'd like it to be. The more people we get interested in it, the better we'll all be.

Ask yourself how would you 'easily get a hold of just US$2000'?
Then just do that with Bitcoins.

Remind them you're not clairvoyant, and next time couch your financial advice in the appropriate terms - "this is an exciting concept but also very risky, with a good return on investment so far every year of the past 3."

Indonesia has very poor internet connectivity in rural areas, and even the capital had pretty crappy broadband provision last time I was there.
However, like lots of african nations they're deploying lots of mobile phone points. I wonder whether a combination of bitcoin and mobile technology could enable the rural poor to set up banking or saving services.
Not to mention that the Rupiah is denominated in thousands - so conceptually dealing with large numbers of digits in their exchange rates (US$1 = Rp12,000, so Rp1,000 = 130uBTC) may make adoption easier for them.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:06:45
Despite the smell of bullshit, here's my advice:
They were planning on giving you an annual fee for managing the investment. This implies a more-than-one-year commitment.
So wait it out.

Thanks, very helpful.
Can you tell me a little about how to read one of these, or maybe give me a link to some basic reading?
