Ha! A trucking company still uses a fax machine.

I'll send them my fist before I send them bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:15:38
I really wish it was. Lol
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:06:53
Nah. I had to google 'bitcoin' to get a better grasp on wtf it even is. Lol
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:48:32
Unfortunately we do. We are a trucking company, and some of our drivers are from the middle of nowhere, USA.

We don't fax much; we receive a lot of faxes from small companies that still use fax machines. I think our best option will be to use a fax to email service. I was hoping someone would have a way to fix the problem; but it seems pretty impossible without a phone number or IP address to trace.

I'm being spammed and scammed. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:35:01
Trust me, I agree 100%. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:35:35
They were already recycled. I just looked. But they're basically just little squares or &lt; symbols on each page.  
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:08:26
I didn't even know you could hide your number when faxing, so I"m assuming they're using an online service, too. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:26:01
Lol! I had 3 faxes come in with no numbers shown. They're filling up our fax machine's memory and running out the paper in the machine. It's beyond frustrating. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:36:54
The number is hidden. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:36:00
hahaha. I'm not sure how old it is, but I am going to guess it's not from the 1800's.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:50:25
It's just a pain in the ass. I was hoping I'd be able to find a way to catch them and get them to stop instead of us having to make changes on our end. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:06:36
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:00:03
We can't because we work with hundreds of businesses and there's no way to know if all of them would be getting our updated fax number. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:15:00
They're the fucking worst. 115 pages, each one has one tiny symbol on it. I want to hunt them down and give them 115 paper cuts. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:07:43
I'm looking into that right now! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:00:24
I'm glad my pain is so amusing -_- 
I'm kidding. If it weren't happening to me, I'd probably find it funny, too.
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:08:09
They're hiding their phone number :(
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:57:00
I like your thinking!! 
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:27:24
Welppp, here's the issue. I don't know how to post pictures in the comment thread. I've never made a post on reddit before, so I'm basically like a naive little newborn. But I do have pictures of the symbols now.

Hahahah!! I made my son gopher chucks for Christmas last year ���� Best movie reference ever!
