Stop talking to people about bitcoin/cryptos who aren’t asking for information, or worse, mocking you for financial decisions.  There are “I told you so” moments about all financial decisions through history; bad times for stocks, bonds, certain currencies, gold, real estate, cryptos, etc.  Ignore the noise and focus on what you know and your financial plan.

What the cryptokids call HODLing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:13:37
Okay; now I certainly don’t want any bitcoin cash.  I will stay with real bitcoin and litecoin.

Just make the law easy to understand it can followed easily.  Please don’t make it convoluted.

Is altcoin money flowing into bitcoin?  Both LTC and ETH are down.

Anything wrong with leaving a small amount of coins on the exchange?  Say, 5% of my holdings in case I decide I want to sell?

More like 16000 by the time I get to work

Some people get incredibly bitter with envy when they realize they don’t have something others do.  With money that gets amped up to near infinity.  Be careful with your bitcoins/altcoins

It is possible that the original vision of bitcoin can evolve in directions that are unforeseen.  It may not be big as a currency, but as a way to store money in an alternative fashion.

It’s nice seeing the past and future in one picture

Is there a source that explains the bitcoin/bitcoin cash feud in an neutral manner?  Also is bitcoin gold going to cause another type of feud?  As a new guy can someone please help me understand this.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:32:47
Can someone explain bitcoin gold to me?  Is it worth having any? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:16:31
I certainly want no bitcoin cash/bcash now.  I’ll get some more real bitcoin

I have some bitcoin in the coinbase. How do I move it to a wallet that is more secure?  I am a mega-noob and know very little about the bitcoin.  Is a paper wallet the most secure?  I basically want to hold it indefinitely long term.
1.  Can I add bitcoin more than once to the same paper wallet?
2.  Is a hardware wallet more secure than a paper wallet?

Cryptos have been on a mad dash up this year.  A pull back is not a terrible thing.  Say bitcoin ends the year at $15000.  That’s only what a &gt;1200% increase?  Bitcoin became a household word this year, nothing can change that, not even bcash
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:45:27
Is that what all the dislike for BCH is about?  A group of people who are claiming it is better than real bitcoin so they can make money?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:53
Whoa!  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:57
It looks like $20k by lunch time
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:37:51
It does all seem rather suspicious.  Last night when it went from $3k to $8k then back to $3k in very short time frame.  I’m staying away from bitcoin cash for now.  Doesn’t seem like a good altcoin at all.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:22:13
There is no dip
There is no top
There is only HODL
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:47
Bitcoin cash went from $3k to $8k since getting on coinbase?  That’s crazy
Edit:  Typo
Edit:  Down 60% back to $3k.  Wow BCH brings volatility to a whole new level
Edit:  Now the $8k peak is no longer on the coin base graph of the price history... this is somewhat concerning
