Everyone knows the Bart pattern is a flawed method of reading charts. We will know this is real when we see a reverse Lisa gradually building.

He makes a hell of a lot of good points, but man is he ever a kook. Dude makes sure his glock is showing for everyone to see. PS - don't even know if it's a glock. I just like that word. Glock. Hilarious.

Now I will honestly say I didn't watch the vid, but I'm a getting frustrated at these BTC and ETH OGs that keep saying this without providing solutions to the problem.
The questions they need to answer is a) how can we stop ETFs from happening (you can't).
And B) what's a better way to gain mass adoption? And this answer needs to be realistic. Most people aren't smart enough to do all the things we as an eductaed community have had to do to own our coins. Which I know is hard to believe.

Some of these people have a hard time understanding market cycles...
Altcoins will gradually purge over time, but there are a few that won't be going away. Like, ever.

Also, I don't want to bog a crypto forum with something unrelated. People only change when they want to listen, so if anyone wants the last word on here then go for it. If anyone would like to continue the conversation further, maybe we can chat through DM on another platform. I would respond on this one if that is the case.

This would not be my argument against meat. There are many far more obvious arguments against, it's just a point being made against hypocrisy that would otherwise go unnoticed.
And once again, it is not ok for a human to kill any sentient being that isn't entirely necessary. 
A lion has a carnivorous anatomy, a human has a frugivorous anatomy. This is not a debate unless your study has been funded by industry.
In combination with factors that you yourself mention, such as environmental devastation and many health based ones, humans have the evidence to tell them what is ethically right. Lions do not have this luxury.
Also lets not get into this bacteria debate. That shit is weak. Vegans are practical (mostly). We have a right to living, and mobility is a required part of that. It's hardly "endless" unless you're jaded by confirmation bias. I ate meat 2 years ago and dairy just 1 year ago. It was not a decision I wanted to make. It was one I needed to make.

No animal should be bred for our use unless it is absolutely necessary. Those animals have no desire to be used in that way, and have not chosen their situation, no differently then the many oppressed people of certain cultures.
Being born into a shit situation does NOT make it ok to continue the wrongdoing.
Btw, sorry to be posting this in a crypto related sub, but the topic was brought up.

I have a problem with this, and let me preface this by saying I hate Roger Ver. But what he is attempting to convey, and somewhat poorly, is that there is an enormous societal hypocrisy.
We all shudder when we see "man's best friend" cruelly forced into unwanted situations, but when a cow is turned upside down and has it's throat slit or has it's head bolted against it's preferance we all turn a blind eye and cram our faces with cancer triggering (factually proven) animal protein. 
I can't believe I'm actually siding with this person, who I have little respect for when it comes to economics, but frankly I care much more about the environment, animals and public health then I do money, so I gotta back him in this case.
Downvote away!

You and your dog have bacon lately? If so then you missed his point.

You may be able to argue that it's in some way worse because it's so much more delibrate, but thats another part of the problem. Ignorance does not equate innocence.
Unless a person lives in a food desert, in which eating a whole food, plant based diet is not possible, it is a hypocrisy to think one is ok. Sure it's socially acceptable, but it is not ok.

I love BTC as much as the next guy and want it to win out, but this is a market cycle right now. The alts will follow as they always do. There's no reason as of yet to think they won't. BTC will likely shed its wealth into them and the cycle will continue until there's a reason for it not to.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:56:51
Well I guess I better cash out then...

I agree. Just using careful words to not trigger too many people.

Bitcoin is King but this talk that the other cryptos are going to go away and the focus is only on BTC is silliness. This is what the beginning of a bull market looks like. Bitcoin booms, then it feeds the other cryptos. The same will happen this time, minus a few more shitcoins. This cycle will rinse and repeat until there are only a handful of solid altcoins.
You can really see the media's alterior motive in trying so hard to push the predictable cycles. They know as long as they know what to expect, it's easier to make gains.

I assure you, as long as volatility is high and market cap is low, they will be used as vehicles to make the rich, richer and the wise, rich. It's simply market cycles. Even some really shitty shitcoins will live again. Even the EOS' of the world will see massive gains again.
