It's more like keeping $20 in your wallet and handing it over if you get mugged (while keeping the $2000 you have stuffed down your welly).

When I saw Karpeles at the press conference, I almost felt sorry for him. However, when I read stuff like this, it's hard to come to any conclusion other than MtGox/Karpeles were behaving in very deliberate manner. Sorry you lost your coins.

I think the remark about panties helps to get to the crux of the issue here. And it is this...
If there's a need for some kind of "official figure" that is the weighted average of several big exchanges, then sure. They could brand it and I guess provide an API. If nothing else, it brings traffic to a website etc.
However, a weighted average is trivial -- it's a standard technique that anybody could implement. But what they are claiming is that they have come up with a patentable formula that "blends" together the prices in some unique way.
**So presumably this offers some value above and beyond a weighted average?** (Or it's just bluff?) That's not an unreasonable question to ask.

Not laughed so much in long time!

But they provide an API (or intend to) ...
Why do this?

This is significant. If true, the message I take from it is that the failings of Mt Gox were not down to weakness in the protocol, but were almost entirely down to the utter ineptitude of one man. Once amateurs are shaken out of the system, we can hopefully look forward to better days.

Sorry to tell you this, but this is just pathetic. 
Whether the subject of the newsweek article is Satoshi or not, he wanted to be left alone. If he is Satoshi, then you are raising money for someone who has more money than Tony Blair.

I felt "unclean" reading that article. It would have been better if he had been left alone.

I see someone asking "how did the spammers get the email address list?"
I am a Bitstamp user but have never used MtGox. I have not (yet) received this phishing mail. I'm wondering if the emails are being sent to Gox users in the assumption that they will also have a bitstamp account?

Just watched the video of Karpeles being hung out to dry at the press conference in Japan. Dare I say it, I even felt sorry for him. **There's something not right with the whole damn thing.**
