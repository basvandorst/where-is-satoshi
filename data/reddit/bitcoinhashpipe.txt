Instructions unclear, dick stuck in wallet.  
  
But for real, could you go back through that and make sure you are clear on the designations of CB vs CBP, and USD vs USDC across the board? Because I’m confused.

This is a great compilation of info, and much needed.  
  
This is also a *very* good example of why bitcoin is not seeing wider adoption. Show any no-coiner this page and they’ll be like WTF this bitcoin thing is way over my head. Now I don’t ever expect the “average” user to be technically savvy enough to understand the intricacies of encryption. But my point is, as long as developers fail to find common ground and standardization, it’s still too complicated for the average person.
The “average” person is not here discussing wallet recovery and derivation paths. They’re out there buying pizza and coffee. They know how their wallet works, it just holds money and cards, which they remove and replace. If they lose the wallet, it’s gone.   ...The ability to restore from a seed phrase is a HUGE HUGE HUGE benefit of crypto wallets, but until it’s super simple, standardized, and just works (always!), we won’t see wide adoption.  
  
Compiling this data and calling out developers is a great step in the right direction. Keep it up!

Taxes are (probably) necessary to facilitate a working government (but we can leave that debate for another thread).  I’d prefer that property tax be removed and substituted with a one-time transactional tax. If that property changes hands, the new owner pays a transactional tax.

Sup. Satoshi Nakamobro here. Wanted to say your coin is nearly perfect, but it really should be renamed BitcoinFU (Forking Useless), but that would take way too much time redoing your website. At least like 15 or 20 minutes.  
  
So anyway, I’d like to be an early investor and will probably send you some other shitcoin so I can buy in to this scam I mean amazing opportunity.  
  
I was thinking also that in the tradition of all shitcoins, you could bring me on as a consultant. Here’s how it works: you give me a massive airdrop of bags and bags of shitcoin, then I tell the crypto community how they should put real money into your pocket. This is a win win situation, because the shitcoin isn’t costing you anything and you will get money. But that’s really over simplifying it.  
  
My credentials are as follows:  
—Redditor for 3 days  
—Read first page of the white paper.  
—Fluent BASIC programmer with some PASCAL experience.  
  
Lastly, I just registered the twitter account for Bitcoin_UF which I’m going to need later when I fork your shitcoin to scam more people. But you already knew that.
I’m going to need a photo/bio on your website, too if I’m going to properly convince these people to ~~fork over their hard earned fiat~~ invest in the future of digitally digitized internet money.

Well, we’re talking about it now! Thanks for pointing it out. I guess that Paxful’s “Money Your Way” really means “Money Your Way But We Will Kill You With Inflated Fees”.
That’s highway robbery. If I were a paxful user I’d be all over public forums, twitter, etc, calling them out (*after I removed all my assets*).

Do not try and colour the darts, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no dart.
  
However, an alternating black/white dartboard is essential for the encryption process.

Don’t feel stupid. The “address” thing takes a bit to figure out. Some people have argued that “address” is not the best term for the thing, that it’s more of an “invoice”.

Stupid answer here:  If I were looking for the “right time” to buy and intending to hold for a looooong time, that’s with the idea that the price will be way up, right? In that case I’m probably not worried about these short term fluctuations in price.  If I expect it to be 50k one day and am waiting on that day, a buy in at 10.5k is not much different than a buy in at 10.0k.  
  
I’m looking for a fall to 9k, but I haven’t seen it yet.  Could happen tomorrow, could never happen. Honey badger BTC don’t care.

I don’t think so. Not yet, at least.  
  
A bit unclear on this court case... there is indication that it might have only been a contempt hearing? Can anyone clarify?  
  
If it was in fact final judgment on the case, then he starts the first round of appeal, and it gets bumped up the courts.  
  
From what I can discern, what ‘really’ happened here was the judge said “yeah, no chance you’re really Satoshi, so I’m going to go with you ARE Satoshi and you owe Kleiman heirs half your Bitcoin.”  With the implication being that he will have no choice but to argue that he is NOT Satoshi in order to get out of having to pay.

In consideration of Craig Shitcoin Wright’s court case, I’m trying to understand the people that are thinking this is *good* for Shitcoin SV. Like expecting it to moon now. Are they just trolling or are they that severely delusional?

I didn’t say I “prefer to not have them” (taxes). I said that I would prefer that the tax burden shifts from an annual collection on the property owner to a one-time collection from the property buyer at time of sale. An equivalent amount of tax collection can still occur. I could continue to argue further positive economic benefits of such a taxation model.
Also, I’m not “mocking a real estate decision.” I’m mocking the idea that real estate is “all yours” when it isn’t. In fact, I’d even argue that it never is, including even in the *absence* of property taxes. As long as an entity exists that can take it away from you by force of law, it’s never truly “all yours”.
So let me reframe this from Bitcoin’s perspective:  Very recently we’ve seen an announcement from the US government that they are *blacklisting* certain bitcoin addresses associated with nefarious activity. Basically they’re saying that bitcoin that goes through those addresses are now illegal to own. So what happens if I legally purchase some Bitcoin using a US based exchange market and proper KYC verification, then I move that BTC off market to my private wallet. Let’s say I then purchase a widget from a seller and send the seller BTC. Turns out the widget doesn’t fit my widget machine so I return it to the seller. Seller refunds me by sending the same amount of BTC back to me. Turns out that at some point in it’s life this BTC was used in a nefarious transaction with a “blacklisted” wallet. Is the BTC I’m holding now illegal? Can a government blacklist my wallet because of the BTC’s “transaction history”? And if they can, do you think that I actually own the BTC?
Oh yeah, you’re right: I can just move to a different country that doesn’t blacklist BTC wallets.
The truth is, honeybadger Bitcoin doesn’t give a shit. You hold your real estate “property” and I’ll hold my bitcoin.
Oh yeah, one other point. When “you say you can move to a state with no property tax and buy real estate” you do realize that I can’t take that real estate with me to another state, right? You can’t literally move real estate. Again, not really your property. But good luck defending your piece of dirt against the no-coiner invasion. Better start building that citadel, but make sure you pay your property tax. (Mic drop)

LOL “a piece of real estate that’s all yours”...  
  
Serious question: what happens when you don’t pay the property tax (aka “rent”) on that piece of real estate? It will be taken from you. You don’t “own” anything.
@_date: 2019-08-27 02:14:06

So you can’t use it directly to purchase goods or services, but you can exchange it for fiat? That’s fucking hilarious.

Consider the following:  
  
.What if this *is* the lower price?  
.What if we have held since an even lower price?  
.What “losses” are these that you speak of? (You only “lose” if you sell at a loss.).  
.Why does everyone lose their shit over a $500 drop from $10k to $9.5k, but no one blinked if it dropped from $11.5k to $11k?
