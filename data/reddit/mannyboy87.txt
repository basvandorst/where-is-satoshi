I heard Head of Reddit Loitering was a solid career goal to make 60k/h

I think that was someone else dude - HODLing is the antithesis of skill
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:28:14
Timing the market perfectly was the ‘skill’ I was referring to as luck. As you said, nobody can do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:19:24
That’s not skill, that’s luck. If anyone had that skill, they’d be a multi trillionaire.

We’ve found the CEO of Bitwage!

I only donate to this charity, but would you consider the Berkshire Community Foundation? They raise funds for, and make grants to, local charities and community groups addressing identified need across Berkshire - it’s not just giving money and having it wasted on vanity projects because they have money in the bank.

I use Kraken - how do I get my bitcoins off my account there?
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:46:19
Now 34.8 bitcoins...

You know you’re only paying tax on profit right? You’re better off taking the profit and paying tax on it, than not having a profit at all...

Your definition of ‘wild’ can change as you age and parties aren’t ecstasy raves you know - you might just be the guy that has the best Cards Against Humanity answers...

“But where did you get that Lambo?”
*shrug* “Just found it”
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:16:57
$5 wrench bro...

Lol you sound you’re more Scrooge than Vanderbilt

My last five cars were bought brand new. Is it the best thing I could have done financially? No. Neither was buying the expensive filet steak last night, when a bowl of nutritious gruel could have met the needs of my body.
But here’s the kicker - we only get one shot on this merry-go-round, and I choose to enjoy my life. No one has been laid on their death bed and said ‘I wish I had more bitcoins to my name right now’. You can’t take them with you. Get out there and enjoy life whilst you still can. Spend some money, explore new places, get out of your comfort zone. You never know, you might even have some fun.

You sound like you’d be wild at parties.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:34:35
I think I’ve got like 27 ripple coins lol - couldn’t buy an R/C lambo with that.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:01:28
That’s what I’m unsure about. I’m assuming it is going to bomb towards the end of the month
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:00:45
TIL... thanks Urban Dictionary
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:02:35
It was play money, so really I want a Lamborghini like u/qwertymanjim suggested!

What bit are you sceptical of? The fact that whales control the market or that it is a conspiracy by the whales to do this? I’m skeptical of the second part, but I don’t see why it makes a difference if it is an evil scheme or basic market forces at play. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:10:51
Thank you - very sensible way of looking at things. To be fair I’m planning to hodl with over 50% of my initial investment for no risk, so I figure that is best of both worlds?

The sad thing is I thought it was pretty funny - I didn’t even consider it to be a dad joke. The transition to fatherhood is complete...

I can’t even see the hole where they were digging...
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:00:41
That’s given me an idea. I’m going to build a website which you can ask a question and it gives you a list of websites with the answer. I’m going to call it Ask Jives.

I don’t know! If only OP would tell us for the fifty third time on this thread, it might sink in. Then again, he doesn’t want to give the game away that this is just a promotion for his company...
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:52:03
Sorry Mr Ridden!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:00:42
It’s a scam?! ��
@_date: 2019-09-27 06:13:48
ERMAHGAWD! Ma moneys is gawn :(
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:09:24
I even put /s in the post title... Of course this is a scam!!!
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:39:30
And to think I was in two minds as to whether I needed the /s in the title
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:51:32
Surely not - they didn’t set their sights low though did they? £450k minimum lol
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:40:56
Sounds like the right time to buy back in ;D
