I fear you presume there are no other countries on earth.
There’s over 80,000,000,000,000 in the world, factoring in broad money. Taking the above as a loose figure you’re effective planning for 1/4 of the world collective wealth to be directly held in bitcoin, theoretically not impossible. But again a lot of it depends on the net held by individuals, and not state’s/institutions etc.

No user here can give you a direct answer, or anywhere else for that matter.
Futures, if you break it down, is just betting on the rise or fall in price. The 'fears' come from the potential of price manipulation, with traders shorting bitcoin to 'win' their futures bet.
Much like bitcoin pricing, and every thing else.. it's speculation. We aren't sure, but as the days go on bitcoin gains more support, publicity is publicity and futures is (all in all) a positive as it shows confirmation of the currency as an asset. Theoretically the larger the user base, and distribution of bitcoin, the harder it should be to manipulate the market.

The easiest way would be to register at an exchange, and register your bank account for withdrawal. For example Coinbase (GDAX) or Kraken. Usually it takes a few days for the process to be complete, I myself use Coinbase and GDAX for trades and withdrawals - yet to have any issues.
Once you’ve registered, send your bitcoin from one address to another via the wallet you’re using currently.
To be honest though, do keep in mind that today is ‘bitcoin futures’ day. We’ve all been speculating a dip before another rise, it’s already moving back in the right direction. I’ve traded and back to holding, but if your personal health is in jeopardy then you always need to do what’s best for yourself.

There isn’t a single point in my post suggesting blind positivity, I actually state that each individual should make their own decisions based on actual facts over fiction.
You know nothing about me, nor my background to suggest that I haven’t done my own personal research or experimentation.
But nonetheless you, my ‘friend’, are a shining example of what’s not needed in this space.
Inb4 another troll shit post, negative comments based on absolutely nothing and kindergarten criticism. Peace.

BTC value should only be valued by the belief in the system, and belief in the currency. In which it becomes a global coin for financial security, and large scale usage for larger transactions. 
There will always be those that speculate and engage in wide-spread FUD. The masses just need to stop being drawn in to the negativity, and make their own decisions based on hard facts over articles from the plethora of random ‘news’ outlets which mostly have no real foundations or strong sourcing.
It’s also not “magic internet money”, it’s a system which allows for much more independent financial control built on sound logic and math.
There will always be resistance, history shows that - an endless circle of increasing surveillance, and fight for control/dominance over the populous... and of course wealth.
The only real way to expedite the process of large scale adoption, outside of all the institutional noise, is to continuously educate with facts over fiction. Which is something I’m currently silently working on, much like individuals running nodes - progress is made through acts of collective positivity and support, no matter how big or small.
The minority can be ignored, but not the majority. We all just need to keep fighting the good fight, for something we believe in.

It’s just a phrase, and this somewhat goes back to my point about needless negativity.

ATM’s usually have high conversion/transaction fees - but there’s the convenience factor. 
Honestly depends on your value of rate over convenience, and also the “shopping around” factor of LBTC.
Both are discreet, I’d probably look to go the LBTC route if it was feasible in my area but it’s always nice to just walk up to an ATM and scan a QR/print a paper wallet without any fuss.

Depends on perspective, I’m running at tiny loss right now but I have zero intentions to stop - as it’s already been said, running nodes and mining aren’t about profit but the general health and support for the system itself.
Profits are just a bonus, but again.. personal perspective.

Has anybody been able to find much on this “group” other than the random fundraising page?
I’m more concerned about “ruling out” that the ‘project’ isn’t a scam, never mind their bitcoin fraud flash text...

My estimation was based on all 21m coins being in circulation also, and I did say I couldn’t remember the exact numbers ;)
And 10% isn’t impossible considering there’s more that isn’t tied up in existing assets.

On Coinbase: instant due to the nature - quantity dependant also, as for others I’m not entirely sure. Some have claimed 28min, others a few hours.
It’s irrelevant anyway, once you  purchase you own x amount of bitcoin.. you won’t be affected by fluctuating prices, it’s just the physical receipt which is delayed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:50:47
I can’t remember the exact figures but I recall working out that 10% of the worlds economy invested into bitcoin would equate to 400k per coin (again, spotty memory)

Scan in the UK, one of the largest electronics retailers, accepts bitcoin - it’s been a slow burner, but it’s getting out there. Adoption by Amazon doesn’t seem too out of reach.

Current price: $5730 
You place a buy order for $200 and receive 0.035 BTC (roughly)
If 1 BTC equals $50,000 then 0.035 BTC is equal to 8.7 times it’s original value
50,000 / 5730 = 8.726
$200 x 8.7 = $1,740 ish
Hope that helps.
