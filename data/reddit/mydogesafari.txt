help a brother out here.

I am offering some 0% remittance to M-pesa and Tigo- PEsa for a limited time for those interested
@_date: 2015-04-27 09:02:31
Deposited the BTC thinking i would be able to withdraw or use the funds on my Pre paid master card..  Silly me for thinking all neteller USD was equal. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:54:54
Hmmm..  I will have to test it and see if it works. I didn't see that when I was browsing their site.

I keep my net wealth in Btc and just moved to Tanzania. :) fuck fiat banksters!!
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:51:31
Aaah ok.   Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:39:11
Aaah ok.   Maybe I will just launch on localbtc for now offering mpesa in and out of btc and test this theory.  Thank you
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:19:52

And I'm in Zanzibar with a MasterCard.  Looks like I will be able to beat out bitpesa now on localbtc . :D. Remittance market is now wide open!

I am currently in Zanzibar, but will be in dar in the next few weeks.
I just arrived from South Africa and have a working visa in Tanzania for 3 months. 
I used to be a "pro trader" on localbitcoins.com and have been a follower of btc since 2013

I would love to open an exchange here but I wouldn't know the first thing about keeping such a exchange secure.  Ye an exchange would def make it easy to start a biz such as this. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:37:20
I emailed them asking if I could get a job with them..  So far, no reply.

You sent mpesa from TZ to Kenya?  According to the mpesa websites I was under the impression international transfers where not possible. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:23:18
Yeah I feel you.   Time to hit local btc and create the exchange. ;) 
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:38:28
Thank you :)

How much is the cost of a wire transfer to say btc-e?
Edit:  thanks for the answer, makes perfect sense.  So if they do wires in batches though isn't the fee on wire transfer the same wether they do batches of customers or smaller more frequent wires?  This I am still confused about. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:40:44
I was saying isn't it risky to the guy that answered that they prob keep all their btc and give out Kenyan shillings. 
I understand how they might mitigate this risk through keeping btc in usd.  I was just under the impression international money transfers where expensive 
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:17:42
I only have 25 BtC sadly.. :( .. But I am thankful I have that many. More than most in Africa
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:22:39
It seams like mpesa doesn't want to mess with international transfers as you can't send Kenyan mpesa to Tanzanian mpesa without first going through a wire transfer. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:19:15
Thanks I will give it a go on localbtc setting limits for myself so that I can try control the flow and see how it goes over a few months.  
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:23:51
Yeah I'm starting to realize this. Very unfortunate
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:11:28
You think 25BTC is enough to start an exchange with no previous coding knowledge?  
I think I am going to start on localbtc on Monday after I have SIM cards from the 3 major network providers here loaded up with atleast a million tsh mpesa to get started.  I was thinking a 3% on either side creating a 6% spread and see how it goes. 
Bitpesa watch yourself I'm coming! Lol
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:15:04
With neteller now accepting btc things just got a little easier. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:21:24
Yep you on the same thought pattern I had.  That return flow is a real shit. Unfortunetly I don't have a million in vc funding and partners to get it done.  But localbtc seams like my best option still and to keep it small enough so that I can control the flow of in vs out 
@_date: 2015-03-24 10:43:58
and is that a sustainable business model?  Seams awfully risky to me. 
And who funded their bank account initially?  The investors seed money?
