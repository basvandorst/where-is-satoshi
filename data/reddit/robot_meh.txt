I question ability to reason those who don't understand this simple fact.
Seriously, why do you think any ASIC manufacturer will do anything but the above. I would go as far as chucking KnC Miner in there. Only they are a bit more clever as in they don't announce producs until they almost done mining and ready to get on to next gen units.
ASIC though real and useful but its run by fucking imbeciles and crooks and they should be treated as such. Scrypt guys have the right idea of modifying PoW algorithm so that ASIC become useless. Wait until someone gies to develop new version, then change PoW. Fuck you arseholes basically.

That's a very interesting situation. Is there are anyone who can clarify this?
Where do transaction fees come from? Will it be part of the cost of goods or services or will the new coin will come to existance?
It seems from the above is that this has not been thoroughly thought through in the mechanism. I would love to know more.

I agree. I can't hate someone I never had a personal encounter with. 
I guess I feel that their case vs Facebook stunk and they were after a quick buck as they saw an opportunity to home in on the pray.
I don't also think that the compensation for the idea without any actual dirty work being done is fair or reasonable.
I believe that the top cap should have been at 100k.

I dont understand the downvotes I guess I hurt someones feeling. 
I dont disagree that popularity has tremendous value. Just look at Facebook amd egocentric ecosystem that bread.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:46:21
You raised a very interesting point there one worth considering. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:41:36
Apart from the fact that I don't have that much of disposable income to justify buying 0.5 btc let alone 1 btc. Things that I would like to buy dont cost that low or simply not available for btc. Plus my options of where I live dont allow me easily acquire btc.
My only reasonable option is to mine using cpu or my average gpu.
I would love to own some but the entry barrier for me is very high right now.

I love you man. I was reading and crying with laughter.

Thats not what I am saying at all.
The availability of goods and services that are of any interest to me and are not totally useless or gimmicks for the sake of just using btc are scarce. I want to use cryptocurrency but the entry barrier is too high for any significant purchase. Its a catch 22 situation. I want to mine btc but with my hardware I cant. I want to buy hardware but its available for btc, although some is available for fiat currency its extremely high for a reasonable system that will not be a wasted venture within a day or two. So I have to buy btc but the price of anything I am interested in is unjustifiably high in fiat so my only option is to mine. Rince and repeat. I am left with the only option of buying in small chunks of $80 here and there which forces me to effectively save and hoard btc until I have enough to buy stuff I want and thats exactly what I don't want to do.
I can not explain this any more clearly. I am sorry. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:33:30
Those who fear or oppose cryptocurrencies have are now coming up with all sorts of weak and not very well thought through arguments just to hate.
Haters will hate! :D
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:19:35
I absolutely agree with you that $10 is $10 worth of btc. However, the things I am interested in spending does not cost $10 worth of btc. There is nothing around me I can buy for $10 worth of btc its just not available. It is not btc problem but rather availability, yet given the current state of affairs I am left with effectively no option apart from putting $10 at a time for some period of time before I can afford what I am interested in owning. Otherwise I might as well be just buying btc for fun just to save up so I can use it one day maybe. I hope you see my point and realise I am not just hating, I am actually quite sad I cant participate.

I didn't see an option on a number of wallets from other currencies so wasn't sure of the mechanism. 
What about sudden drop in hashing power so thag the block is not found for weeks if not months?

You are exactly the kind that have put many off of bitcoin while helping alt currencies grow.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:43:07
This is the same with any other cryptocurrency. You can only acquire it by trading with miners or current holders. There is nothing that makes bitcoin any "better or worse" than its alternatives as such but popularity
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:32:38
I read somewhere that it was around $266 mark. We can check trades around then and look for 11M worth of btc movements.

Its all just a friendly nerdy circlejerk.

Wonder if any of those significant diff adjustments correlates to a few month before release of new gen miners.
This would be a nice evidence of kncminer et al getting the hardware in well before the release date, mining the crap out of the network then dropping it to the public once it becomes less profitable for them.
This is why kids you should not trust all of those companies with your money.

That also includes CPUs, GPUs, DDR, FPGAs, ASICs and even PSUs. Say good buy to your desktops, laptops, phones and tablets ladies and gentlemen. 
God damn greedy wankers.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:15:48
Greed gentleman. Nothing but pure greed have gotten you in to this position in the first place. 
I do feel for people who have seriously committed to a significant amount of worth in to btc but at the same time greed never ends well. 
On a slightly more positive note. I'm very much looking forward to Winklevoss scammers getting a heavy hit on their btc fund. They are the definition of sleazy, greedy,  lying,  tossers. They deserve to lose all the money they got from the settlement.
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:20:02
I envy you... I want cryptocurrency to be widely spread. For now is only hand to hand exchange. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:57:25

Please note that I dont have strong feelings towards one or the other before I say the next thing.
Ripple is no more or less ponzi than Bitcoin in my eyes. Both are based on useres trust in the system and the level of trust assigns some value.
What I don't understand is why Bitcoin community gets so butthurt and so sensitive to anyone being sceptical or curious about it. It really is a massive turn off.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:50:17
I also hope for the price to plummet to very low value because I too would like to get some and start using it. Seems fun. I am not in for a long term gains.
However, I want those asic hardware scammers to take a good hit (knc and butterfly labs I am looking at you). The operations of such enterprises are pretty dishonest and those do deserve to fail and be left with worthless hardware.
