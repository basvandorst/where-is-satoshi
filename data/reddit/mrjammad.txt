The details are all as per their website, the only thing to look out for is the account number and branch code detail that I mentioned above.

Any bank should be able to arrange a wire transfer for less than a fiver and as it's GBP-GBP you won't have to pay any currency exchange fees. But annoyingly, the information on the Kraken website is wrong. Their account number is NOT 6793010727. 
The Branch code is 679 and the account number is 3010727. Ridiculous that they don't get this right, I'm stunned at how ridiculously murky* it is to buy and sell virtual currencies in 2017. 
But anyway, Kraken support is taking over a week to respond to tickets at the moment (!) so I verified this info here on the SMBC website:  . Just do a search on the page for 679 to confirm the branch details.
*Most crypto ccy exchanges have their bank accounts in countries that have the best regulations around crypto and/or are best for tax structures. So you'll often find, in my limited experience, that you have to transfer money to oddly named accounts in far-off places. This will have to change for widespread acceptance, I am sure. But for now, we have to live with it. Your bank will probably make you confirm a disclaimer that you know you may not get your money back, so you have to sure you get the details right and that you're never investing more than you can afford to lose, which is the same with any investment, of course.
