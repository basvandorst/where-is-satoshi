Same thing happened to me. 16 days and still didnt got my money. They are saying all the time about backlog etc.
First of all they convert my money from gbp to jpy. I asked btw my bank and they said that they sent it as gbp. 
Secondly i accept that conversion and i asked them to deposit them as JPY in my kraken account. Support came back to me and told me about delays and backlogs etc.
Its been 16 days and still didnt got my money. Now they are just ignoring my messages on support. 
JUST AVOID THEM.

I have send them via :
1. Support Ticket
2. Facebook page
3. Twitter page
4. Pm here in reddit 
Noone really respond. I dont know, just avoid them guys. Only in that way they will learn how to operate.
I have no words to describe them. 
How hard is to transfer my money from their bank account to my kraken account ? They got my money before 13 days at least. 
What i am thinking is that they have no money. Simple as that. They used my money to pay others and now they are waiting more money to pay at some point myself. There is no other explanation !
Note that the amount is quite big - 8,000gbp -
