The weird thing is that there is only my transaction with the address... If I am the only one who did a transaction with it I don't understand where this address comes from...
usrn: what are the possibilities? Multibit adress? already checked. The website where I bought the bitcoins? already checked and already asked the support to see if this wasn't one of their adress, it wasn't. I don't see other possibilities :(
Introshine: 280100293470930272690489102: you see, it works...
ITSGOINGDOWN: that's what i'm trying to find out... Yeah, lesson learned since now...

I really doubt that this is a virus, to be sure I just ran a scan but there was nothing...
I know that if I sent them to someone I would be fucked but it's not someone who I have already trade with because this adress was nowhere in my wallets...
I know I copied a wrong adress but I don't know where I got it :( 
BobAlison: I don't speak english very well and I have trouble understanding eveything in your link and this "If a wallet contains one address, it returns change to that address. If a wallet contains two addresses, change will move back and forth between them." could you please explain a bit more..? But here are the details of what you say wasn't clear:
-I bought bitcoins on a website, so they went to my wallet in the website
-I transferred them to a new wallet in Multi bit (I already had one wallet in Multibit but I didn't wanted to use it directly), at this point everything was fine.
-I tried to transfer the bitcoins again to my other multibit wallet (the one I didn't wanted to use directly), but I pasted a wrong address, which I don't know where I got it...
So frustrating...
Thanks for all your answers though, you guys are very nice.
