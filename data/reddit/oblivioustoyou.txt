They will crash just like the last time he did this.  He will then purchase all the fees for super cheap, reopen the site and then pump n dump them to the suckers who come back.

Yes that is the terminology I was looking for.  Thank you.

Mining is printing money until the 21,000,000 are fully mined.

I received a cash advance fee buying bitcoin from Coin.mx.  I had purchased several times from coin.mx and only received the cash advance fee on one transaction.  Capital One refused to refund the fee despite not having charged it on almost a dozen other transactions.

So many who did not read the rules.

Any machine, be gone with your Windows hate.

Just because the TOS says something, doesn't make it true.

Your bitcoin are at risk if they are on ANY machine connected to the internet.  There is no way you can dispute that.

Not sure where you got that idea, most, if not all, their money was seized.

Why are you using an online exchange as a wallet?
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:12:18
Fuck the police.

That's not zero tolerance, that's pissed people who lost money not playing on your site anymore (and probably not playing on any site again).

They don't need to prove anything when they have a confession.
@_date: 2014-10-26 12:21:23
It isn't a plus at all.  Realsolid has a history of doing this with the exchange, leaving everyone else high and dry.  He is a scumbag and a scammer.

They claim to have discovered his identity from old forum posts.  It's just as likely they backed into that evidence from illegal investigation tactics.

Any idiot with half a brain would have never gone back after the last time he pulled this stunt (after banking millions from mcxnow fee shares).

Well at 4pm EST the price was $407.24 so...

It's called parallel construction and it is definitely a thing.

Bitcoin needs him more than it needs you.
