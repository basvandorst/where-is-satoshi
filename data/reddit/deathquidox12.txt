Someone said it correctly about 10million people own Bitcoin right now. The price goes up when we get closer to the 21 million Bitcoin max out mark. Which makes the price of Bitcoin sky rocket to astronomical amounts of money. For example if you wait till Bitcoin is 99% gone by everyone the prices are wayyyyy high for it because supply and demand if the demand is high and the supply is low the price is up wayyyyy more than it should be. In the past few years everyone buys Bitcoin in December which makes the prices go to 20k a Bitcoin + people are saying to hold you're Bitcoin because true fact in 5 years of investing 25-50$ a week into it over the course of 5 years you will have alot of money put into Bitcoin and when it's scarece the price will be well over what you originally paid for 1 Bitcoin if it's hit 20k before it will go higher than that at some point in time when the supply is low. Which makes Bitcoin a long term investment not a short term. Short term investments make you 1-100$ roughly if that depending on the amount of money you're playing with. When it comes to trading any kind of stock patience will get you the money you are looking for selling early is where people screw up. Never look at stocks as a "get rich quick" you will loose more money than you will make I promise.

Yes it comes up but it's kinda iffy sometimes because it's saposeably a UK site but my friend put in 300$ and in a week he was sitting on 2700 literally 7 days no trading or anything just simply letting his money sit in this "Bitcoin" account
You literally just watch ur money grow every day

Pornography is one of the most addicting visual things on the planet. Look at the statistics. And YouTube could be sued for things like this. That's why they created YouTube kids
