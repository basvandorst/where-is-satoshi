As long as any such rollback is possible these systems cant become mainstream. There is way too much interest to fuck people over with such loopholes

Is this whole of Germany or just like Berlin and stuff? Because I'd bet even here in Finland you could technically live off of Bitcoin if you lived in one of the larger cities, especially Helsinki, but here where I live there isn't a single business that accepts bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-12-17 14:48:58
So you pay for third party in bitcoin and get credit or do they just bill you each month? 
What happens if suddenly price of bitcoin drops like it did while back? I mean you aren't probably going to be penniless, but if you buy something for, what you think is 1 BTC and by the time you get billed price drops and now it's 3 BTC, you just paid a lot more for food or whatever.
Do you have a backup savings account or something or are you just trusting that BTC will keep being a thing?
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:26:31


Are you fucking serious?
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:29:10
Then again you can actually buy stuff with credit cards as oppose to bitcoins
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:45:41
How do you buy food? With mail order? Or do you just order takeout every day?
@_date: 2016-12-05 19:32:21
Why would you give your credit card number to them? Or is it standard practice in 'Murica to store credit card numbers that are just used at the cashier? 
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:28:10
Yeah. This is cool if you got in on the very start. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:34:31
It's the 3-4 digit number on the back of your card. To use a credit card online you need name of the card's holder, their address, card number and the cvv number.
Some countries don't care about name on the card or the address thou
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:22:51
Maybe so in your country. Here you can not withdraw money without 
A) being physically present with ID 
B) having the credit card and using ATM 
C) knowing account name, password, and having proper 2FAs
@_date: 2016-12-05 19:16:57
Only if you give out your credit card details to everyone
@_date: 2016-12-05 19:20:01
So what is this suppose to prove? I can also give you my bank account number, you literally can not do anything with it expect deposit money and isn't bitcoin address exactly the same as bank account number?
@_date: 2016-12-13 15:30:30
Please just don't. Unless the person you are giving bitcoins to is already a user (in which case you are just giving money) they most likely will not appreciate the gift. You are just giving it more because you find it interesting and want people to get involved than giving people what they actually want.
Even I have a very casual interest in bitcoin and if someone were to give me "the gift of bitcoin" for chirstmas I'd be very underwhelmed unless the amount was actually substantial 
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:30:57
Yeah, so it's people giving out their credit card details without thinking. I can't remember last time I actually typed my credit card number into browser and I can't think of a good reason to do that.
Every online store here either accepts Paypal or straight online bank payment, sure either my bank or Paypal could be hacked, but at some point you have to trust someone. I'll take that small risk over not being able to spend my money since it's in form of bitcoins or due to random fluctuations my money losing 2/3 of it's value.
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:26:18
Not applicable here since I'm not American. We don't use routing numbers here.
@_date: 2016-11-27 07:44:22
I don't get it, can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:22:56
How do you proof anything like that? Also depending on organization 24 hours might not be enough time under some circumstances. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:32:26
Wouldn't exactly the same logic go with credit cards? I mean sure criminals can just guess your credit card number, but it's pretty hard to make valid charges without name and address.
This being said 4 years is pretty short amount of time. I mean I've had credit card(s) for nearly two decades and I haven't had a single fraudulent charge made against them.
@_date: 2016-12-06 05:05:14
Good for you. I still can't buy food or basically anything from my country with bitcoin. So it's 100% theoretical to me. Add on that the fact it (at least in my eyes) hasn't proven itself anywhere and every time I check how my $10 worth of bitcoin is doing the price has changed a lot.
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:52:22
But capitalism requires governments for money to have value, so I doubt that is what he is going for. Or obviously we could go back into using gold and other rare metals, but it would take a long time before everyone got their hands on some and world would spin into utter chaos in the mean time.
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:59:16
Aww shucks. I thought I could at least watch the English parts (interviews), but instead of subtitles they have dubbed over them.

I would love to hear what this guy thinks this would achieve. I really hope it's not just another loose Marxist idea in tune of: "once states and money disappear people will be free from capitalism and everyone will be happy"

What would happen if right this second all other currencies stopped being currencies? What would happen if people could only use Bitcoins to buy stuff? How many people have Bitcoin? How could they get hold of some fast? Would corporations all over the world be able to switch to Bitcoin within a week? A month? A year?
What would happen to public infrastructure without governments paying for it? Would people just start taking care of roads, water pipes, power lines? How about Internet itself? Would it keep working if suddenly all governments/states were removed?
It's not hard to see that if money suddenly lost all of it's buying power there would be utter chaos. Millions of people would now be without food or ability to obtain some. Or do you believe that humanity would rally as one and people in factories producing goods would still show up to work and keeps all the machines running in trust that someone would get them fed at the end of the day?
Maybe in the future if a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, becomes so common that everyone has them or at least can obtain them fast, whole world could switch to it, but we are so far away from that future it seems pointless to even suggest it.
@_date: 2016-07-18 10:07:10
But in the end it kind a is, you can argue that gold has value without governments, but in today's society most people do not have access to gold to pay for living, which kind a means it's not as valueable as current fiat currencies.

I am not aware of any wallets in any space. I am a mere mortal watching from a far. I bought 10€ worth Bitcoin few years back, for a test and they've been just sitting in Coinbase.
Just trying to express that telling people to not use Apple products probably isn't best strategy in the long run if you want Bitcoin to get popular enough so you can use them on daily basis.

@_date: 2016-07-18 14:14:37
No, but right now, today, it pretty much is the only way. I get why people here get so caught up in the semantics of "what is money" and "how money gets it's value" that they miss the obvious. Your currency is worthless if it is not traded in bulk. I'm sure there are some people who trade in Bitcoin and there are some percentage of people who have Bitcoins, I bought 10€ worth four years ago as a test, so using me as an example if all rest of my wealth that isn't tied to real world assets would dissapear and Bitcoin would be substituted I would have grand total of ~15€ to live with. I could try to find someone with a lot of Bitcoins who would want to buy my car or something, but what are the odds he would trade with me? Especially considering that you can't buy gas with Bitcoins (at least I haven't seen any station offering this where I live).
Not to mention all the other services and things that currently depend on the government.

Yeah, you need to have 51% computational power of the network and no one has ever gained or been close to gaining that.
