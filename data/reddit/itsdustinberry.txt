How you gonna buy your drugs now?
Can't you just go to the website and activate the card... I mean my tax return came on a netspend card and I had to go to the website to activate it.

Damn, their website says they want 20% of what's in the wallet.

You do make a good point.

See if you have a libertx near you. The ships that sell them never ID so I bet you wouldn't have any problems.
You can either download the libertx app. I know it's for android not sure about iOS. LIBX will take 4% of what you buy if the retailer is a pin retailer. You have to purchase from libertyx in multiples of 50. Libx is by far the best btc vendor I've used personally and I don't mind paying 4% fee. Matter of fact, I only use libx.
You could also use the libertyx website to find location. You could always get the coin atm radar app and find btc ATMS in your location but they take an obnoxious about in fees if you wish the atm. It's something around 15% fee.
TLDR: check libertyx locations. Go to location and buy the bitcoin.

I believe there is a website called coin finder or something like that that'll show you atm locations. You could try that?

I googled it. Cannot find link.

I fucks with it too :)
Simple, fast, and 4% fee is cool with me.

I've heard of bitwage but never tried it.
I am downloading the app now and see what it is all about.

It's so hard to believe that CA of all places is lacking in libx. I'm in Ohio and they're atleast 6 locations in columbus that I know of.
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:03:06
That's usually what I get when I bring it up too. After I explain it's for btc they always seem to get 20x more interested. I am trying to collect as many 100$ bonuses that I can :P

May I don't understand but why is it a problem we have to provide our own wallet?
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:55:04
That sucks :(
I do hope a lot more locations open up soon. I'm just lucky and live in columbus ohio. They're only libx in columbus and cleveland. Other than that it is about 200 miles in any direction for the next closest ones.

I'm not sure. I just found this service and there are 3 libertyx locations and 3 ATMS all within 20 miles of me.
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:01:12
Best believe I have been trying to get more stores to get it. I bring it up to every store I go onto. I've gotten 1 referral and that is the shop I used all the time.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:52:45
The store I use only takes 4%.
I notice all the ATMS in my area take 14 to 15%

Send a pm to bits of change that replied here. Bring up libertyx to marts. They have to sign up to receive the service.
