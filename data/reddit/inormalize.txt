Well, the title talks about printing money; why wouldn’t I look at money supply?

The fed can’t print anything, its the us treasury that does the printing and the fed can’t actually purchase securities directly from the treasury.  
You don’t seem to understand the fundamentals of how newly issued money is distributed and why it shows in M2.

China, with a much smaller economy prints 2 trillion a month.

Just because the fed buys bonds and changes the balance sheet doesn’t mean they printed the money since they can sell the bonds. I thought M2 was a better metric for seeing what’s been printed?

China banned bitcoin in September 2017 and exchanges started shutting down shortly after. The Chinese were using bitcoin to get money out of China, so they banned it.

It's their currency, Yuan. Since they set the exchange rate and buy everything in dollars it doesn't really matter how much the print. Nevertheless, they crank it out at much higher rates per GDP than our fed.  I belive our GDP to dollar is around .68 while China's is 2.xx. The yaun should realy trade around 20 to one dollar. [

To clairify, it was banned from financial institutions in 2013. 
Then banned exchanges late 2017 which popped the bubble. 
Next they will ban mining and purchasing.

You’re assuming hashrates rise at the same rate as difficulty.

You can solve this a number of ways.
Given total gold = 190,000 tons or 5,541,654,000 troy ounces
Given total btc = 17,928,300
1 over 17,928,300 = x over 5,541,654,000
solve for x
roughly 309 troy ounces.
