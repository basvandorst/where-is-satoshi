I had to plug my phone in to keep watching.

What about bank info? Is that not the same for mobile bank apps? 
Also, how is the person supposed to get all this money? And if this was to happen, the block chain can be reversed to before it happening.

I enjoyed reading every minute of that.

Like a lot, 50%. Take the buying and selling transaction fee, add them together. Then take that number of $ and divide it by the original price you paid.

Technically I can go sell one for $14,000. By your logic trading anything but fiat is worthless. It's all what someone is willing to give you for X that makes things worth anything.

When did it go up? I see it's at 650 coins now 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:09:27
First I thought this was gonna be a begging post, it wasn't, shame on me. 
Wish your family luck.

Fucking upped the price almost 2x

How mainstream is it? I think a lot of people have heard of it but still are not buying it. 
2. There can only ever be 21M bitcoins, with estimates that 1/3 or more are lost forever. So that puts us at 14M, only 14M people can have 1 bitcoin, max. With prices right now there is a lot of people who don't even have that. I think they might get a bump in their net worth but they will still have to work.

Coinbase goes off GDAX price...It just lags by a second.

Yeah its wasteful. But money is what our world revolves around, like it or not. That's why we get jobs. We do not live in a communist society. This is the wrong thread to complain about how much of the earths resources we are wasting, feel free to make one on this sub but I doubt many people here will listen to you. They have all thought that the costs that are important to them outweigh the negatives.

Good luck! I thought American military pay sucked. Guess I won't complain now that I see your side.

5 BTC on the way. Use it for college. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:26:17
Happened yesterday also, same price. Same time. Took like 8 hours of trading.

I doubt it, all those sites that sell for a mark up are scams from what I've seen. Best To buy from amazon or eBay, there you can at least get your money back if you never receive the product.

They are divisible to 8 decimal places. But what I'm saying is that if I owned .000005 bitcoins, let's say it's worth $5. For me to be a millionaire the price for 1 bitcoin would have to increase by 200,000X. I dont think most people have the bitcoins to get them to be a millionaire.

.1 bitcoin sounds like a steal for that. 
I hope it was a reputable buyer. They are going for 2450 direct from bitmain. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:45:20
No I'm in the navy. I thought American military people pay was bad. But it's much better than yours. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:37:50
Just some random numbers. They don't accomplish anything useful.

It literally says bitfinex cold wallet.

Wonder when his short expires, I can't stop watching it now. Thanks a lot

Base pay is $3300 per month. Plus a housing allowance. Sea duty pay, food pay. 
Maybe $8000 a month. 
I've been in for almost 9 years now.

Good luck.

That's like a super serious question. I wanna know too!

I hate when the entire text is the title, I open it up to find so much more....and nothing.

It doesn’t override it they are different laws enforced by different police.
