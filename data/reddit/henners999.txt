Yeah zoom out to September 1st, looks like a scaled up version of that. Sellers look worn out, it could drop further but I'm expecting a spring back. Everyone's so damn FUDDY that it's time to be greedy!

They blocked my last transfer, charged me 10% and I ended up losing out massively. Now I use nationwide

Great work reading, thanks!

Invest. This time next year, my guess is you'll at least have doubled your investment. If not, hold for another year and you may have added a 0 to the end.
Or lost it all :D

There always seems to be resistance before the £ psychological resistance points
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:58:30
How so?
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:02:00
Is it riskier though?
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:58:20
As long as you have enough in your account online you shouldn't get margin called unless it completely bombs 75% is what I understand.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:43:39
Haha, I need to make my own meme now!

Wowzers, what a find! Just a few things I can think of being in IT myself: I’d recommend firing up the hard drives as a secondary disk using a USB adapter, something like this: 
It’ll be safer than firing it up in a pc itself. I’ve got hard drives to work multiple times this way. 
I’d also recommend backing up the data as SOON as it fires up just in case you delete something by mistake or it fails shortly after firing up. A disk imaging device will do this for you and will be worth the outlay in the long term, or at least until you can move the data to a Trezor/Ledger. It sounds like you’re a careful guy so imagine you’d do this anyway!
Other than that, best wishes and good luck!

Were people saying this about $1k when it was more like $1?
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:11:30
Wow reaching $7000! By the end of next year! Are these people idiots?
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:14:28
If you leverage long sensibly you can't lose :D
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:33:24
True it does but I imagine that's the image people want who buy them
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:13:26
Think when it broke $1k, how soon did we get to 2??
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:20:57
Yeah it just sucks that stole money and I missed out on the BTFD!
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:24:54
Remember $1k-$2k? Didn't take too long to double did it? Just saying...
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:54:00
I was down through China but it never halved. Just top up your BTC and wait.

Yeah so with any luck by 2019 we'll be at $10k! Rock on baby!

Why should we laugh at him? We know nobody knows the future! The guy has done his calculations and we like his results. If nobody knows the future it doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun guessing! Bloody Nora! 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:46:02
Bloody hell they sound amazing. Santander we’re fine up to this week then suddenly no help whatsoever. I told them on the phone I’d go if I wasn’t told where my money went or why Nt they said they couldn’t find out. I can’t believe they don’t know all the information in this day and age! Unbelievable! I’ve got a nationwide account I was going to use but maybe switch to hsbc on your recommendation and hopefully get some cash back! 
Thanks one and all
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:37:06
Ps with this amount of coin I’d seriously recommend looking up how to use passphrases on the hardware wallet. It’s basically a way to have hidden accounts that you can use plausible deniability on (look it up!). Also it means if anyone happens to find your 24 word seed and you use a hidden wallet they still won’t be able to access your coins.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:44:24
Just go all in now and save yourself time and money!

People always underestimate Bitcoin. $20,000 next year easy :D
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:42:44
Oh really? I find it pretty good so far.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:21:37
Ha! I woke up at 4am for a raz and stupidly checked the price! Didn't sleep until 10 minutes before the alarm went off!
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:43:46
So who are you to disprove it? A blogger. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:05:05
Probably done for that reason. Waiting for an 'Asian tech engineer' may take some time!

@_date: 2017-10-13 07:19:43
Same here. Parents and sister bought but brother in law said it was too risky. I said the current financial system is risky. Cognitive dissonance!
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:04:56
Couldn't you sell in Brazil, convert to ethereum and send back. Convert to bitcoin? Problem is you have to sign up to the exchange which is probably limited to locals with bank accounts

It's the kraken iOS app
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:29:15
Bitcoin will be a store of value with some very large investment in the future. Ethereum is a meaningless token (separate to the company which I'm sure have some great use cases..). 
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:58:07
Yeah but I couldn't sell enough to make the price drop £2!
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:32:01
I got all shy ��
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:16:10
I'm not sure, let me make you a new one ��

That I don't. Ps

What will you do when it hits 3000?
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:41:11
Why the hell not?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:54:32
Got a slight logistical problem on this one... 
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:59:30
Really, that's what the Internets told me although I'll believe anything!
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:40:16
You'd need proof of residence no?
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:29:21
It's OK I worked this out, thanks again.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:38:54
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:17:59
What about if it forks and loses value because of the fork? Isn't that massively likely??
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:05:08
Sell that shit and buy a bitcoin with it
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:40:23
Nah best he waits for s2x if that happens and dump that like a bitch

Go to buy in intermediate or advanced mode and select your leverage 
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:01:52
So we have to unlearn it?
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:56:50
Yeh I asked because it seems way too low. I think it takes people like mcafee to have to balls to throw some insane numbers out there and I'm with them, i think six figures by the halving. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:54:58
Maybe his memory is atrocious 
@_date: 2017-07-09 14:19:24
Yeah with one transaction per block. 32gb blocks or we hard fork
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:52:46
Stock up on coin while you can. If segwit came in a year ago we wouldn't have this yearlong BOGOF sale we're experiencing now. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:55:02
He's not joking either. I'd side with him over a lot of peeps. We'll at least see 250k and for that I'm forever happy!

@_date: 2017-07-09 17:58:48
Possibly why Bitcoin will be a store of value and some other will be the transaction coin eventually
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:06:18
They will come

@_date: 2017-07-16 12:22:56
Thanks for this. I've got my node up and running. Is there anyway to get this running with the front end software as you get with the Core download? CHeers
@_date: 2017-07-09 10:54:16
Maybe for those who don't understand it fully. Difference is the top people involved with core can see potential for big blocks in the future but the powerful big blockers seem to dismiss core side developments and say that core is taking over bitcoin and need to be stopped whereas it's people like Johan, Roger who are taking it down for their own monetary gains and not Bitcoin's. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:28:33
It's his helmet
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:29:04
Err Kraken..
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:40:36
He says he's never lost a bet. Ever
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:16:46
He actually predicts about $1.5/2 million in 3 years :D Errrrmmm....
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:20:07
It means to buy btc with the exchanges money. Like a loan. When you close the position you either make 2x 3x 4x back or you owe it. Risky
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:16:55
Small nit pick, would Stella be sold in Blighty way back then?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:42:01
No probs
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:41:24
Are you serious with $5k? Gut feeling? 
@_date: 2017-07-09 09:04:02
It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic. Trying to explain there are other routes as well as bigger blocks to big blockers is like trying to have a balanced debate with a Christian that God may not exist! 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:50:31
Hedge 10/20% into ltc/whatever else and hodlington the rest chamone 
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:46:47
It'll level out in the end
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:20:45
No, nothing is guaranteed but if the activation of segwit isn't as good a guarantee of anything in the crypto space at the moment, with all the publicity and hype surrounding it, I don't know what is. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:13:25
Who dat? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:41:31
He goes up and down on it
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:18:53
So you're saying, once segwit confirms, the price won't reflect this added confidence?
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:07:21
When do you think it'll crash?
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:30:19
The most reliable bitcoin prediction ever made
