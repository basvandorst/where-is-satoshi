I'm just curious because this is a pretty smart dude who is disagreeing with tons of other smart dudes. Sometimes the Bitcoin support network is a bit of an echo chamber and I just want to know if you think this holds any weight.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:34:02
I think that means that it only holds value if people decide it does. Contrary to how that sounds, he's basically comparing it to a gold standard. Paper money is also effectively worthless, but it has very tangible value in our economy. Bitcoin doesn't have that yet. So it's certainly inflated compared to the uses it actually has.

My question exactly. I have trouble seeing it go lower than 5k, since I believe that's a "nice" number that loads of traders have set for automatic buys, and at a nice 25% of its height, it seems like a pretty sweet deal. 
Selling out at 6.8k would kinda suck if that were the case. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:34:17
I figured haha. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:20:00
11.5, meager amount. I love seeing it though :) 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:47:46
I wanted to buy in a bit at 4.5k..
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:22
hahaha i suppose it is! thanks for responding
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:42:51
I’m goin 5.5k 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:53
Commented this below, but I bought in at 11.9k, then again at 9.8k to round that out to 11.3k. I'm planning on putting in more if it reaches 6k (or maybe 6.5k) which would put it at 10.3-10.4 overall, and then I'm done honestly. Unless it surge crashes.
But I will feel comfortable with my meager investment at around 10k, because I have a lot of faith that it'll get higher than that in a year or two once again. I'm a beginner into this so I'm probably just an optimist, but I'm keeping my investment at exactly what I can afford and nothing more, so I'm not worried.
Thoughts?

and just like that, up $150. someone's buying the dip!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:09:39
yeah lmao
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:22:27
Think we’ll hit any more big dips? I kinda wanna sell once I break even at around 10k, and buy back in lower. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:07:28
I haven’t heard much about that beyond speculation. Do you have any concrete sources you trust on that? Not trying to be critical, but just curious! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:07:30
Eh, that's small enough stake where you shouldn't have to worry. If worse comes to worst, you can sell and then buy back in lower. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:57:34
damn, for real? I don't really know how much basis there is for it to drop lower than 5k. I don't think now is the time to cut losses. I feel like it'll be up in a week or two (after chinese new year, after a positive SEC meeting) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:08:08
agreed -- that was cool to watch! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:08:41
That doesn’t sound preposterous! So you think selling now and buying back in later is best? Is that what you’re doing with yours? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:15
I invested some disposable savings into bitcoin. I invested because I believe in its potential. I've been familiar with it for a long time as a concept, and only recently (since I got money) as a personal asset. 
That said, it's fun to watch the trends. I'm not here to gamble, but it is very reminiscent of gambling at this stage, no matter how we look at it. 
I can't speak for everyone else, but I think a lot of us can simultaneously enjoy the gamble while investing for a loftier reason. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:02:53
I think the answer then, in your case, is to just hold onto it and forget about it. Go distract your mind with something else, and maybe set some alerts for prices so you will get notified without hanging onto the number all the time. 
If you need quick cash, then sell of course. It's your money and bitcoin doesn't help you if you're starving. 
But for the record, I do sympathize. That sucks dude and I hope it goes up soon and that you reach a point of financial security :)

his name is cryptowallstreet so he's legit
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:11:49
oh wise master, should i invest more? lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:23:27
why are you the way that you are?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:18:16
Now I can fall asleep without worrying I’ll miss 4.5k! But I’m nervous to leave this unsupervised for six hours ._.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:56:05
I have a lot of questions. What kind of hope are you looking for? Did you invest more than you could afford to lose? Did you not realize at the point of investment that bitcoin is a volatile gamble at this stage, and investing is primarily with the expectation of long-term gains? 
Bitcoin grows in bubbles, and it's prone to crashes. If you need more info, I encourage you to look at graphs that show that bitcoin price over the last year resembles each of the previous bitcoin bubbles. 
There is no bottom to how low the price can go. We're all kind of blindly hope (with some hope in statistics and meaningless predictions by "experts") that that doesn't mean the end. 
We, the average folk, invest in cryptocurrency because we believe in its eventual potential. If you invested in this for a quick buck, then you're probably going to be disappointed. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:59
what is happening? can someone do a TL;DR of why it's dipping this low? Is it just the India thing? Is it bc Asia is asleep? 
I'm kinda new to this and i feel like i'm missing part of the puzzle.

What would be the point of selling now if I believe it will go up? (This is a real question)
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:20:23
Dude same. What a time to be alive honestly
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:51:16
I'm waiting for 5k to be a turning point but I don't know shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:48:24
I would just hold onto it dude. That's my plan. You solidify your loss when you sell. If you're not hurting for the cash, then just put it out of your mind, count it as gone, and focus on something else that doesn't give you anxiety. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:16:11
I was thinking about it more as dollar cost averaging. This is historically a profitable way of investing. 
I'm not investing thousands that I don't have. These are small sums that I can afford. Thank you for your input though! If you have anything constructive, please let me know.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:49:16
I'm starting to believe this too. I was holding at 5k, but your analysis sounds correct. They might go to 5300 or something but I just don't see it going past 5000.
I'll eat my dick if wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:32:11
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:04:10
Hmm. What do you think it'll be then? I won't scrutinize your numbers, but I am curious. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:41:42
I did not :/ been gettin spooked by all these people telling me the floor is super low lol. I am gonna give it a day or two bc I’m anticipating 5.5k. Guess we’ll see!
