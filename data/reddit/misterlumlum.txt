I think you could get a whole lot of Ron Paul supporters as well. Instead of 'auditing the fed,' bitcoin gives the people the freedom to decentralize the authority around currency production. The wonderful thing about that is you can start TODAY instead of endlessly campaigning for a cause that more then likely won't come into being.

true, but can't one bitcoin be divided into millions of ways? and due to human nature, do you think this cap could be changed or rid of completely in the future therefore causeing inflation of bit? i guess an example of this could be etherum. it does not have a cap as of yet, but if very well could. can't bitcoin (since it is 'created' by humans using computer power to 'mine' it) existed in the same way which brings inflation into the picture by existing with and without a cap? Gold in this sense is different because it can't be created as it is a natural resource as bit is human generated. I could be wrong, please help me if i am mistaken.

honestly, i think they have really lost the memory and feel of Aaron Swartz, which it was suppose to be a place of community and free ideas.
