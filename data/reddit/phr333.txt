 Indeed! Making your coins unavailable to anyone, hackers and yourself, is easy. The difficult part is to secure them while still being accessible to the legitimate users without too much hassle.

It will be worth a lot more if BTC goes to the moon. Innocent now, but could be dangerous in the future

"Besides the typical Bitcoin network fee, there are no fees for either the publishers nor the readers for now. As Satoshipay’s popularity grows, the team plans to charge 10% for all
publisher payouts"
Right. Everyone will be fine with that. Not.
At least not for just facilitating the payments. That will hopefully be done practically free by others by then

The earth's surface is apparently 5e15 square feet.
Select 3 random locations -&gt; (5e15)^3 ~1e47 combinations which is way less than 2^256
Also, mind that the locations must be random. So at leat one is likely in the middle of an ocean. How do you remember that?

Sure. Just as you could write down the original key to begin with :)

5th rule, you only own bitcoins if you (alone) own the private key. I.e. don't store your coins on an exchange or similar
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:07:02


Well... SHA-256 is the 256 bit version of SHA-2. There are also 224, 384 and 512 bit versions of SHA-2

hitbtc.com only 2 confirmations required, quick in and out confimed by multiple ppl. Though you might find better exchange rate at other places(?)

Well, depending on the cure you may also need to check the order of the base point. See 
Edit: The cofactor for secp256k1 is 1 so I don't think you need to check the order in that case. But I would double check that statement :)

Is it just me or is it impossible to see the difference of "H" and "M"?

I would switch too, if there were other android wallets that supported Trezor.

I just got the same letter. I had an account at Mt Gox, but I'm fairly certain that I didn't have any remaining balance there. So, I'm quite sceptical.
@_date: 2016-09-20 06:12:13
So is this done off-chain? Can someone explain how this works?
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:49:18
Why not Lord Vodlemort?
Yeah, yeah, someone had to do it right?

And lack of liquidity.
They had a scary moment where the backer (knc) whent bankrupt. Props how it was handled though. They also handled the bcc fork well imo.
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:34:12
So, what are we looking at? ��
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:23:47
Yup. One can probably correlate many of the coin-age-reductions to significant wallet updates, e.g. introduction of HD wallets, HW wallets, muti-sig etc.
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:28:17
So, on average you just need to wait [2292260.26 days]( roughly 6275 years before you win. Or a lot more, given that the global hash rate will continue to rise.
Cool product, but no thanks!

I'm trying to figure out why Jorge Stolfi's opinion weigh so heavily on the SEC process. Reading the latest SEC statement he sent one out of six comment letters. Is that it? Could anyone (with some reputation in economics) have done the same? In that case I guess we need some more positive thinkers doing just that!
@_date: 2016-10-07 12:45:35
My quess is that you used a large PIM:
 
It's set high by default for security reasons, but if you are fine with lower you can set it to the same as TrueCrypt for instance. Then it should mound as quickly as with TrueCrypt.
@_date: 2016-10-19 12:46:10
That's nice. But site authentication through trezor would be a bigger step security-wise.
Still, thumbs up!
Can you confirm that no unnecessary information is sent to Bitstamp? I.e. for withdrawals, Bitstamp need only to know about the destination address and amount.

Adding a password completely changes the generation of addresses so you must move the BTCs from the addresses generated before you added  password to an address generated after adding the password.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:15:45
Thumbs up!
Only negative thing I have to say about it is that the liquidity is somewhat low at times. I've contacted them about this and the reply I got was that it's due to friction towards the underlying markets. Difficult to keep up when the turnover or volatility is high. They are working hard to improve on this.
@_date: 2016-05-18 16:32:39
Trezor 2.0? What's that? Never mind! I'll have two!

The tough part was not to buy $5k's worth. I would have done the same if I knew about the tech back then. The difficult part would be to hodl all the way to $500+
Many traps on the way where most would sell off large chunks, if not all...
