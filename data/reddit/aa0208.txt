Can I donate 100 btc?

When I first tried Coinbase in July 2017, I paid £9.50 fee to transfer through my bank, then Coinbase rejected it cause they didn't accept from UK.
Use Solidi or try local Bitcoins. I use Solidi simple bank transfer and get your stuff straight away

How did you tax situation look when you cashed out? And how did you cash out in terms of banking regulation, did they have any issues? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:05:38
That is just lazy 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:09:54
Looks very similar to the letter B hmm
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:58:01
It'll probably start going left on the graph
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:22:32
Had to Google what that was, damn it's crazy people trade skins for game weapons and the prices are damn high! Wow
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:07:30
How the hell did you have $9500 to spend when you can't even work? But looks like you've made massive gains congrats, lucky you enjoy it but don't blow it be smart
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:05:26
Quite a rubbish savings account with it being so volatile
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:17:48
I'm not in America it's all good
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:37:42
Anyone? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:27:26
Then buy some altcoins instead 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:06:37
Such as? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:06:08
So if you have Bitcoin, you'd get the equivalent in the new coin? "free cash"? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:10:39
That's a possibility with everything which is why you only invest what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:43:13
Good on you bro! Haha I guess
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:16:36
When is the snapshot due to take place? And is it just for btc or also bcc? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:22:14
I guess it depends why you're in crypto. Probably the wrong subreddit, I'm in it to make a profit rather than getting rid of the banks
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:58:42
I tried Coinbase but it's a nightmare for UK users. They rejected my funds twice because they weren't accepting GBP. AND verification sucks especially on the app which is buggy
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:29:56
Make way more profit. Bitcoin will have to go up by a couple thousand just for you to double the investment. Whereas if you invest in things like ripple for example, only needs to go up a few pence for you to double 
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:19:49
I wouldn't invest it all in Bitcoin, it would need to go upto £5000 for you to double your investment, better to diversify over a few coins with that amount of money instead. Ethereum only needs to get to about £500 to have double for example 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:46:17
Glad they worked out for you. I've just got into Crypto, got some ETH then second round accidentally sent Bitcoin to a Bitcoin cash wallet stupidly, trying to recover it. Looking for the next big thing in crypto to get that moolah
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:04:15
Spare a little changé please
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:49:47
About 24 days
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:57:00
I'm gonna be out there first off, how much did you make??? 
Second you can make a new bank account and not tell anyone and cash out to that, will likely have to tell the bank about the money you'd put it otherwise they'd suspect fraud. And you'd probably have to pay tax on what you cash out depending on how much it is. 
Use an app called Expense IQ to budget and plan out how you will want to use the money 
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:29:12
Right ok thanks
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:47:54
I don't use either but I saw on video on YouTube where I believe he stated if you put forward a buy/sell offer there are no fees at all, so no 0.25% either 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:23:09
I think the hope would be for it to reach something like $250,000 then will fluctuations or +-$1000 wouldn't really have much effect and would be stable. It's only been out 8yrs and not many people (in terms of global population) use it. Once more start using it then it'll become more stable.
Although personally I believe it would be overtaken by something else which would go mainstream

30th. No 31 days in September 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:07:10
Yh, main thing is don't spit when you blow out the cake
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:24:59
I use Solidi but it's worth checking bittybot.co beforehand to see which places have the lowest prices for UK bank transfer. It's normally Solidi but some other sight came up last I checked for £200 cheaper
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:11:41
Check bittybot.co for the cheapest places to buy. I buy from Solidi just cause it's really fast and can do a bank transfer, rather than international transfer
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:51:26
Best of luck, get addicted to crypto xD
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:35:44
True that
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:33:10
I hear localbitcoins.com is pretty good but never used it. Will you get paid cash? What country are you in? 
I don't know about the tax but I guess if you get paid cash then no tax. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:12:16
.... Ok
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:14:42
Localbitcoins.com? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:16:17
Buy 1 btc every week for 4 weeks or whatever interval you want
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:52:54
Maybe buy a bit now then à but each week 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:58:16
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:46:09
Buy and sell prices aren't same if I'm not misunderstanding
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:41:54
From my understanding, when he gets paid tax would've already been accounted for. He would receive the net pay. He would only have to pay tax on any capital gains from the Bitcoin. But if he sells the btc for cash its all good. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:59:29
Yh it'll dip, nothing consistently goes up forever. But who knows how much it'll dip 
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:08:08
Yeah we don't have all the info. If he's in America, I could be wrong depending on how they get paid, taxed etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:42:26
I'm basing it off uk regulation
