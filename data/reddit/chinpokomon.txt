Thanks. I read through it myself to find the answer, but that's one of my biggest [pet peeves]( of Internet forums/sites.
Even then, I'm not sure about the solution though, requiring a Chrome App. At that point it seems you'd have other options at your disposal so I'm not sure what you gain. That's why I answered yes with a question mark.

That depends on what your definition of equal is.
Under the laws of the land, which specifically describe the rights of citizens, then no, they aren't equal. If you are asking me about my humanity, of course they are and we should be doing everything in our abilities to try and improve the lives of everyone and respect everything.
This debate is specifically about how as US citizens, we have Constitutional rights. If our Government won't respect the rights that are the basis for our society, then it makes little sense to argue that non-citizens should have them, even if that were the case.
The Fourth Amendment states that "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." And the Ninth Amendment, that "[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." Together, these amendments are often cited as the basis of a Constitutional right to privacy. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment established US citizenship.
So when we are discussing whether a right to privacy is being validated, the legal framework for the argument is US citizen centric.

In 1994, during my freshman year of college, I wrote a paper about the commercialization of the Internet. I discussed the perils of making secure financial transactions and how emerging technologies like SSL were going to foster the emergence of a new market, the likes of which have never been seen before. I also chose to use references I only sourced on the Internet, to further promote how it was going to revolutionize a new way of thinking. I think I may have received a "D" for that assignment.
I rediscovered that paper about a year ago and it is shocking how accurate I was in some of my predictions. I don't think it was perhaps the best paper I've ever written, but it was certainly worthy of a much higher grade in retrospect. The reasons I was docked points seem a little trite and I wonder now if I wasn't graded by a technophobe.

A year or two ago, I came up with a similar concept. The idea was to use the blockchain as a way of establishing secure authentication between multiple devices including IoT devices. By having each device validate the blockchain, you could use it is a public ledger to document what connections were allowed between devices. I didn't make much further progress because I think it would still have to operate over TCP/IP and would be subject to spoofing attacks that might not add the layer of security I was hoping for. I haven't completely given up on this concept yet and it's interesting to see that others are exploring other uses of the blockchain as well. Personally I think there is a lot of unexplored uses if a public ledger like this.

And there are people who want to ban the bot...
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:18:42
There are valid reasons that someone may want to do this for closed source projects. I don't however believe that something published as open source should be able to falsify what is essentially a legal document and therefore backdate when the license takes effect. It seems shady, but it may be legal.
If all the authors of the source code agree that their code can be published under this new license and they want to effectively relicense from that date, it is effectively saying that all the code distributed post that check in is covered under this license. If you happen to have a copy of the source that you legally cloned before this change was backdated, this can't modify the terms under which you licensed it. This only restricts current access from this repository. Another repro, as long as it abides by the terms of the license it was granted, could extend the license perpetually, but it won't be able to accept any future changes. This is why changing the history is kind of pointless. A GPL license would allow you to redistribute the source under the GPL license.
I'm not sure how the law would look at cherry picking, if you were to only pick up changesets that didn't have the license change. I suspect that receiving any source is covered by the presiding license at the time, and therefore it would create a messy tangle of licenses if you picked specific changes. Would the new license only apply to the patches?
IANAL, but this is my understanding of the situation as it is basically contract law.

I just went and read through the comments posted by that account. Every one of them follows a bot post and there are a number of canned responses that keep repeating. The bot _may_ pay attention to how much is tipped, as I saw one $5 tip where the bot replied "Big Spender," but otherwise there isn't a lot of thought put into it and it contributes nothing.

That makes it seem like an attack vector when you say it that way. If the User Agent string makes it clear, and there's some exposed surface area in a version of the browser that can be exploited, it'd make you an easy target. At least with a variety of different wallets right now, it's harder to target a victim.

I wonder how badly our modern audio codecs mutilate the audio signal. I bet that a lot is lost since the source audio would have a lot of high entropy as it transmits 1's and 0's.
@_date: 2016-03-14 04:15:31
Yeah, but since it is specific coordinates, that suggests that you would see very specific frequencies. Since MP3 and other lossy CODECs drop masked human audible frequencies, it wouldn't surprise me if some data is dropped. If the encoding has some recovery data, like Z-MODEM protocol, then maybe those lost bits won't matter, but I think Y-MODEM or Kermit might have been more common with MODEMs at this time. I don't think those have error recovery checksums.

So you believe that the exchange caused the sell off? That's a load of malarkey.

The exchange rate is governed by a lot of factors. Brexit is probably a huge source of volatility. While Bitcoin is not tied to a government or banking institution, as long as there are exchanges that will trade with such fiat currencies, they aren't completely independent.

BFX's volume was affected of course, but triggering any panic sell off is certainly beyond their grasp.

Out of curiosity, what more could you do than to transfer it to a paper wallet? The public hash is on the blockchain, but there's no avoiding that since the blockchain is by definition a public ledger. As long as the paper wallet isn't used, that's safe. If I want to spend some bitcoin on something, you have to make two transfers, one to the address you're moving funds to and the rest to a new paper wallet. Am I missing anything? As far as I can tell this method is impervious to any sort of electronic hack. The only improvement would be to break all the funds into multiple accounts so that if one were somehow compromised, it would limit how much could be stolen. Treat that like a savings account and I don't see how it isn't locked up tighter than Fort Knox.

Better described as wiped maybe than formatting. It's a loose term anyway. Most people when they think format are using a quick format which just expunges the FAT tables... this is what they are thinking about when they say it is recoverable. The file system, method, and drive technology are all factors in trying to determine if you can recover. Based on your response, yeah it's probably not retrievable.

Well, I'll do some back of the envelope calculation. Gravity is -9.81 m/s^2 and the bus was going at 15 mph or roughly 25 m/s. You'd have to know how quickly you decelerate. What that bus hit caused almost immediate deceleration. At 1 second deceleration you'd already have almost 2Gs. This deceleration was probably much higher. Try jumping off a second story building and grab something just before you hit the ground. It probably hurts and is unlikely that you'd be successful in stopping your impact. Just ballparking it, I think that's probably correct.

I built a small Raspberry Pi farm of 4 U2s. I was mining dust. I think anyone looking to use Blockchain technologies should spend some time mining, even if at dust rates the earliest their pool will pay out is over a few months. It helps understand the process from top to bottom. The odds that I'd find a solution on my own is staggeringly low when compared with the hash power of the ASIC work horses, but it's rewarding to try nonetheless. At least with a good pool and a good pool operator, there are some residuals but unlikely to pay for the investment... that's also true for some of the larger rigs unless you have cheap electricity. This is a major factor in why China is such a concentration of miners.

I've never seen it anti-crypto, just anti-The problem is that both sides of the argument seem right and wrong. Supposedly, posting negative opinions about bitcoin on will have you shadow banned. That alone will create some of the polarizing opinion and it sponsors mistrust. Bitcoin has a problem, real or perceived, that it can't scale for microtransactions. Bitcoin cash has a problem that it is seen as eroding the value proposition of Bitcoin and undermining its authority of being the most valuable cryptocurrency. The reality is that this is a manufactured problem because Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash serve their communities in two different ways. Bitcoin needs the liquidity of Bitcoin Cash with the market cap of Bitcoin. Increasing the volume of transactions, decreasing the transaction fees, and restoring Bitcoin to the decentralized exchange leader would resolve this divide. If Bitcoin were to increase the blocksize it would give us a way to process higher volume and make Bitcoin something to HODL as well as something with which to buy coffee. Bitcoin needs the liquidity and anonymity of fiat currency with the sustained value like Gold appears to create for those indoctrinated in the olde system. And we need a safe place to have these discussions in an open forum. I want nothing more than Bitcoin to live up to the vision of a highly tradable exchange currency, but the toxicity of individual gains seems to be clouding judgement and that objective. We need to bridge that divide to allow Bitcoin to blossom into the most liquid and sought after cryptocurrency and to establish its dominance over fiat currencies and altcoin markets. Let's collectively let Bitcoin flourish and stop being so self destructive by trying to be self serving.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:44:24
I'd like to increase the blocksize too. As for PoW, sure it is a cat and mouse game, but we could always change it again in the future. Deciding the fate of a cryptocurrency should probably be a factor of those involved in the transaction as much as the miners.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:03:44
It's Capitalism. Purchasing the patent, implementing it, hiding its usage, and even trying to resist market change because it destroys your advantage, these aren't inherently evil from the perspective of doing business. In fact, as long as you aren't actively trying to sabotage others, most people will agree that you have that right. Bitmain has probably had an advantage over everyone for 6 months to a year based on when that paper was published. The thing is that it is up to the community to decide if we want to change the protocol in a way which will defeat this advantage and this of course is assuming that the change can be invoked without causing self destruction of the cryptocurrency.
What we really need to decide as a community is how we can prevent any single entity from amassing so much hash rate that they can dominate the network and effectively centralize control. It's a concern I've had for a little while and antpool seems to be growing a little to big for the community's good. Segwit and modifying PoW seem to be effective and practical ways to bring this back under control without greatly impacting all that we've built so far.
While I think might have over stepped a few times with the efforts they made to take advantage of others, the only way for the community to respond is with our hash compute power.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:37:49
I don't believe so. After we mine our last coin, those investments aren't going to be worth much anyway. Instead the PoW should be distributed to the background; every client should be contributing some as part of the transaction process. We need to make sure that this aspect of bitcoin is decentralized as much as possible. Lots of little independent workers.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:50:26

I didn't think that was going to be the most controversial thing I wrote in that comment. Patents certainly work as an extension of Government control, but that is a component of the World we live in today. I absolutely think that both Patents and Copyright laws need to be updated but I would rather see that we reward the sharing of ideas instead of everyone hoarding their ideas or obfuscating them. A patent grants a limited monopoly of an idea but more importantly it documents how that idea works and how anyone can copy it and implement it on their own. I believe that is a concept which can still work within the Bitcoin community without being dependent on Government.

What said, and more. The issues where they are divided, such as Roe v. Wade, those are the topics waved in your face as a voter, but those are the details and not the core issue at debate. The parties will go out of their way to point out the differences between themselves, but that's because pointing out how they're the same won't sway voters.
As a final thought experiment, consider some beetle, how easy would it be for you to classify that insect? Would you be able to identify the males from the females? Are you sure you'd be able to identify another beetle of the same species? Yet the beetles can tell the difference, you betcha.
There is more in common than different, but it is much more difficult to see where they overlap than it is to focus on how they're different.

PhD. doesn't necessarily mean smarter than someone with a GED. PhDs, teach you two things, how to research and publish, something you can do without the program, and how to teach, which should make you more familiar with the subject, but not necessarily smarter than someone who otherwise masters what they need to know. The certification alone won't make you smart, it's what you do with it.

I have beyond a GED and have turned down doctorate studies because my industry already moves quickly and there's always something else that's been a better use of time. I'm not against earning a PhD.

That's the point of commodity currency. I don't think that was pointed out in this first part, but that was clearly where there are going. Printing more money is going to have the same effect as digging up more gold, but the state will argue that since they are the only ones who can print money, they negate the threat that exists with something based on commodity.
