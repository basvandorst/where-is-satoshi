I just did.  When you sell, it's a taxable event.  You've got it wrong.  That would be an easy loophole.  We could just gift each our BTC and pay no taxes when selling it.

With BISQ, it's possible to use fiat to get cryptocurrencies, move your crypto to a local wallet, and trade on their platform while you own your own keys.
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:13:50
That's why decentralized exchanges such as Bisq will prevail.

That is funny. It's not helpful if you have to associate your current identity with your anonymous identity.

If you see someone with a gun in their hands, then you know to be suspicious either way.  Otherwise, most likely the weapon would be concealed, and you probably wouldn't notice it either way.
The important question is would you rather your family members have a gun to protect themselves if they suspect a high risk of lethal violence or would you rather that they call the police, wait, and hope for someone else to handle the situation.  I'd rather my family be able to use their judgement as to what would best protect themselves.  Having a gun wouldn't prevent them for calling the police if they thought that would be more appropriate.

1. Yes.
2. 300+ bitcoins.
3. If it's linked to the $, then 5% as a minimum.  Otherwise, 1% as a minimum since bitcoin is a deflationary currency.
4. I'm mostly interested in small business loans.  I'd like to aim for people that can make a reasonable case for being able to repay the loan within 6 to 9 months.
Coinbase would need to partner with multiple credit agencies to give users accurate credit scores and to have established relationships with debt collectors/consolidators.  I'd like to see borrowers actually post a listing with detailed information explaining how they are going to use the money.

It's no more centralized than Bitcoin is.  You could alter the code of your BISQ client if you choose to.  In a similar fashion you can use your own version of Bitcoin code for mining if you wanted.  However, it's not likely that miners would choose to do that.  In a similar way it's not likely that people will have the incentive to alter their BISQ code.

Just start using decentralized exchanges.

If you look at published papers, the scientific community considers Bitcoin to be decentralized.

I don't sell Bitcoin "to cash" out.  The only times I sold it was because I needed money for various things like a down payment on a house.  I buy Bitcoin monthly and sell when I'm required to.  I hold long enough that it is very likely that I'll make a profit.

You can't do that.  Banks can do that, which is effectively a hidden tax.  However, banks are no longer necessary for lending.

That's not true. They don't have your private keys.

Terms are defined by their popular usage.  To communicate effectively it's important to understand this.

Governments hold claim to fiat currency.  In a very real sense governments only let people borrow fiat rather than own it in a direct sense.  So, from that point of view, it is possible for them morally stipulate rules about fiat such as taxation.  However, governments have no proper claim when it comes to barter.
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:22:22


I agree with what you're saying in regards to "just because".  However, it could be argued that the contract of FIAT runs deeper than just a debt obligation.  Probably such an argument would be walking the line of something like a social contract.  However, you could at least imagine some copyleft contract that says "my organization will allow you to use and trade on our behalf this fiat money in return for you agreeing to follow our taxation policy.  In return will attempt to offer price stability and high liquidity."

People have the right to attempt to communicate anonymously.  They do not have the right to anonymity.  Similarly, you have the right to choose what information you share and how much you want to "remember".  Of course, that means you have no right to control other people's communication channels or whether you are forgotten.

Bitcoin is a square that can't be pushed in today's circle.  It's reasonable to expect it to be a disruptive technology.
@_date: 2012-02-01 00:09:39
How is price stability being measured?  I don't think stability should be measured relative to currency.  The real goal should be to encourage entrepreneurs to run their businesses by bitcoins as much as possible.  Ideally, all participates will buy and sell goods in services in bitcoins minimizing the use of the exchanges.  Rather than price stability, people would be better off if their buying power in bitcoins steadily increased over time.
@_date: 2012-02-04 04:28:31
Would you say that the price of gold is stable?  A successful currency should have a similar trend to the dollar that gold has, i.e. steadily increasing over time at least on a year to year basis.

I think it would be difficult to convince Generation Y and below that these technologies are evil.  Artists are increasingly embracing p2p, which is destroying the attacks of the opposition.

Do you mean to make whatever is new mainstream?  Ideally, cryptocurrencies themselves would become mainstream.

If I did, I could buy insurance for it.


There's no debtor's jail.  Them defaulting is a part of the risk, which is what justifies the higher interest rate.


That's not true.  I considered all the data the website provided, which admittedly is sparse.  However, the website does the credit scoring for you.  Also, I looked how they were intending to use the loan.  Once again, that's not perfect, but I'm certain my accuracy was better than an automated algorithm.


I said at least 2, and yet you spoke as if the reason you gave was "the" reason.


The percentage is low. Also, I really haven't tried since I've prioritized other things.


That's like saying most businesses fail so we better not let people start them.

I think the next big bull run will be a of rising to some value near 20,000, fluctuating for a while, and then increasing like crazy again with high volatility until stability is reached once again.

How is that at all relevant to our discussion?


The advantage of peer to peer lending is that loan seekers can get better rates than they would from banks.  Also, investors can better rates by loaning to other people than to loan to banks.  Cutting banks out of the process helps both parties.


Lacking sight does not imply anything about somethings feasibility or desirability.


No.  They gave various metrics like credit utilization, etc.  It's as much as standard algorithms would have access to.


On the side I'd like to start a business giving loans to other businesses.  It might fail.  Why should anyone have the pretense that stopping me is in my interest?

Bitcoin is just the next p2p.  As technology progresses, assumptions that old business models rely on are seen for the shames that they are.  Generation Y and below are becoming more open to sharing and freedom.

Peer to peer lending platforms such as lendingclub.com.  As the SEC loses its relevance, corporate bonds will become more accessible to the general public as well.
@_date: 2012-02-01 13:59:55
Sure, it's just that it's important to keep track of the goal.  With that in mind, I think price stability measured in terms of the goods and services that can be purchased with bitcoins is what should be aimed for.  Many currencies themselves are at risk of becoming unstable, which could incorrectly indicate that bitcoins are unstable.
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:14:05


It doesn't have to be micro nor in developing counties. Heck, just to try out the platform. I let out a few thousand dollars to different people wanting business loans on the platform.  I've been completely paid back since then.


Yeah. I met some in grad school.


In this world there are usually 2 reasons for everything: the one that sounds good and the actual reason.  It certainly sounds good to say the government is there to protect people.  In reality what they have done is make it illegal for non accredited investors (i.e. not millionaires) to participate in vast majority of the primary market.  Does that protect me? No.  Does that protect rich people's ability to encourage people starting a business to take ridiculous equity deals for financing?  Yes. 


I traded options back in 2008 and got a PhD in Mathematics in 2010.  And yet I'm not accredited investor.  The government is not the friend of normal people.  It is there to protect the interests of those already established.

I read it, but doesn't reddit's culture solve this issue?  Noise is drowned out by upvotes and downvotes.  Also, posts don't seem to have a long lifespan.  People see posts and move on.  I agree that cat pictures don't make sense here, but it can be helpful for people to discuss Bitcoin related topics such as what are the alternatives trying to replace Bitcoin.

It wouldn't be nearly as great as you might think it would be financially or otherwise. In the best case for US citizens public healthcare would be funded with debt that gets defaulted on. But even that would leave the system vulnerable and less robust.

People need to start buying things with bitcoin so that fiat can be deprecated.  Buying things with bitcoin makes it possible for others to be paid in bitcoin.  Ideally, you would be paid in bitcoin as well.

There's no problem with that.  The point is the entire tax budget should be cut.
