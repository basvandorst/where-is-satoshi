Sick guy, thanks. Damn me and my monoligualism.

I totally agree with you. Transactions could be moved off chain into ripple gatreats with companies operating said gateways monitored and constantly challenged by a foundation/ombudsman style organisation.

Positive/negative, who knows. I was ready for pretty much every other comment except this... :)

Indeed, yes I have. Is there an application to what I’m suggesting? I don't know much about Whitecoin, but our blockchain will act as an autonomous decentralised cloud-storage archive. Similar but different to Namecoin. 
I should add that in the course of our conversations we have been alerted to the idea we may be able to use an existing crypto-currency or smart token. These are the kinds of reasons we are reaching out. We have the will, the plan and some capital, we just need consultations and evaluations on how the community thinks would be the best way to proceed.

That's been a popular comment from people, and there's even been discussion that we might be able to use another existing crypto or smart tokens but there were certain issues with that. 
Part of the idea in trying to start a discussion was to talk about ways we could approach this to maintain the highest integrity. 
There's nobody on my team looking to make money of this project, we are just at our wit's end as to how we can contribute to solving the issues that plague the world.

I've sent you a PM
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:18:17
Definitely. I've been thinking how strange it was that nobody has thought about it yet, it seems so logical.
Can you send Skype details? I'm based in the UK

This should be quite a priority. This is what Bitcoin is all about, connecting people. Also Nokia have big ties to Microsoft don't forget. Nokia seems like it could benefit enormously if it did this.  Someone should get a Facebook petition going, it could explode.

Think it's just a simple moving average.

We are effectively nobodies. Two of us have a long history of trading Bitcoin, and one of us is a developer. Until we make a formal announcement and release a white paper we wanted to discuss the idea solely on it's own merit rather than our expertise or lack of.
In an ideal world it wont matter who we are because we don't wish to own or control any aspect of the platform or site. We just want to foster a completely open and transparent conversation about how a platform like ours could end corrupt politicians and media whores. Until we give reason or an omission to suggest otherwise please just assume that we are just a bunch of do-gooder philanthropists that want to give something back by making politicians and representatives accountable.
@_date: 2016-01-25 10:16:33
That's a really good idea. I hope you don't mind if I steal it.

Yes, right next to "1m" is "settings", at the bottom of settings you can change the indicator parameters.

We need to save the world with a decentralised reddit, nvm save reddit.

From what I understand from the title you bought $50 in Bitcoin and you paid a 40% mark up ($70). Is that correct? Please explain which services you used to buy the bitcoin (coin base, LocalBitcoins for example) and what payment method you used (wire transfer, PayPal etc).
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:19:30
Thats a withdrawal from Bitstamp I would assume.
@_date: 2015-11-26 19:40:05
Totally drunk as a skunk 22 million btc on it.
@_date: 2015-10-31 08:28:57
We have some ideas on how this should be done. Can you code?
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:12:06
Is $70 not a 40% mark up on $50 worth of bitcoin? 
Swings and roundabouts I guess. It was pretty late for algebra at the time I wrote this ;)

Easily one of the most exciting projects right now. We have been deliberating the use of the blockchain in politics for a few years now and would love to share our insights hopefully they could be of some use. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:20:03
I think moving democracy to the blockchain is an exceptional idea. Politics is broken thanks to corruption and corporate mass media bias. The solution is making these people accountable. Bring brackets accountability and you will bring back representation and participation. The current system is so unobjective, unquantifiable and abstract to most people so we need technology like this to bridge that gap. We've been mulling this exact issue for some time. I've sent OP a message on the matter and I hope he/she would be interested to share our insights.

So the specific inputs are signed then. Ie emptying the address and then refilling it and trying again would invalidate the tx because it would be different inputs?

We toyed with the idea of setting up a distributed cash ripple gateway in the UK for this very reason. Demanding agents deposit collateral bitcoin at a central party you could 'spread' the cash out geographically amongst your agents and allow them to earn a % fee or flat rate for deposits on/off. The banks would hate it, but a judge would have a hard time telling you that you've done anything wrong provided your compliance and AML requirements were through the roof. Bitstamp is already a Ripple gateway too.

If you mean theres no private key, its on the back. If you genuinely dont know, just Import the private key into blockchain.info or mycelium. It's a single key not a seed. A seed is usually wallet specific and backs up infinite consecutive private keys so when you make paper keys etc you always use a single individual key so anyone can import it. You ccan get a public key from a private key so between those who know.what tthere doing you only need to pass on the private key (as a QR or written down, or preferably both)

If you don't have 2fa enabled this is not unusual. I've made 4 withdraws the last 3 days all went through in less than 10 mins. Also I had 6eth that weren't credited when the eth network went mad and polo disabled withdraws. A few days later they were eventually credited so things seem to be working behind the scenes just slowly. Update your ticket every 48 hours with a friendly comment maybe just to make sure.
