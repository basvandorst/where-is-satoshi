Does it though? I’ve seen it choked out several times now

The time to scale is now. The world is not going to wait. If core doesn't deliver said capacity somehow very very soon... they are going to see their own defeat to BCH or some other coin.

100% agree. I'm hopeful as well.

I couldn't imagine pressing the go button on that amount of $$$ in one transaction. I would be a complete mess.

This. We collectively decide whats it worth. If we want it to be 100k, it will be so.

I'm not destroying anything. I want BTC to succeed. I'm more vested in BTC (even if its barely fractions!). I'm just saying the time to adapt to what users are demanding is now and I hope they make it happen. The window of opportunity for BTC to continue this stranglehold on crypto is slowly closing. If you think the masses won't latch onto something else and leave BTC in the dust, your fucking bat-shit crazy. 
Edit: I guess I read your comment but somehow missed "TI calculator". Now my comment seems silly but I'm leaving it because I meant it.

They already dumped BCH to the users. They did mine at least

Not stopping anything, Your being a whiney bitch.

Everything is a ponzi in that regard.

That guy was the feds, it was all part of the plot

Same here. I traded 2BCH for almost a full BTC when it was high. Still sitting on two just in-case I'm on the wrong side and I lose everything else... at least I won't lose everything. As much as I've learned about crypto in the last few years, I still feel dumb about it overall and know I could fuck myself out of everything by choosing sides but it will be real fucking hard not to trade those last two to BTC if it pumps above 3k again.

I don't know what I take from it honestly so have no specific point other than to mention it hasn't completely ceased, just slowed and moved to another chain.

This would mean that any coin could technically become bitcoin and with their current thought process, take over the BTC ticker.

Now how do we get Trump to shut his mouth too.

Also it is not just the strongest, it’s the standard. There aren’t paths to others without it except a few places. It is the reserve currency of crypto. It will be a huge  feat to dethrone it.

Is it? I'm constantly fixing Wireless Networks of families whose kids should have this shit figured out. Its not because they are lazy, its because they don't have a clue how it works. Its just magically worked their whole lives so they've invested zero time in learning how or why.
I have high school kids that grew up in tech and they still don't know the difference between a router and modem (and they don't care). If the WIFI is down, short of power cycle... they can't fix it.
I'll agree there are more young programmers than ever before but that doesn't negate the fact that 90% of the rest of youth can't tell you the difference between a router and modem, couldn't setup an email client, or don't know what their "desktop" is.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:33:32
If you step back, it really is that simple. Trying to take over the name and ticker cannot be construed as anything else.

Yea except the next myspace doesn’t get to call itself MySpace, they come up with their own name. I can’t think of any other software that forks and keeps the original name, am I wrong on that?

By who? Please direct me to who controls this flagging system you speak of.

I took the statement as more literal as a specific entity and I was wondering how I’d never heard of it. That said, you make a perfect assessment and I don’t disagree. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:42:20
It will have already officially went to shit

I didn't make any claims, just wish he would quiet down like Dimon.

This kinda shit scares the hell out of me... well it would if I had anything :/
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:41:52
Our opinions just differ, I accept that.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:58:56
If it does happen, the masses aren't going to flock to BTC as most aren't bright enough to know what their desktop is.... let alone figure out cryptocurrencies. 
Much of the youth in the US aren't learning technology in masses as far as I can see. Older generation is running the infrastructure and the youth know Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. They couldn't hook up their own WIFI if they needed to. And they sure couldn't figure out cryptocurrencies beyond purchasing it through coinbase and then losing it to a hacker.

It seems more often than not you can assume they will do what is best for them.
