I'm happy to hear that and hopeful it was just a lapse in customer service as you said. Sadly it's left a pretty poor taste in my mouth as my first transaction with them but hopefully they will resolve it now.

Update: 13 days later, still haven't received my money or updates.

Hey, just wanted to let you know that the issue is resolved and the details are provided in this thread.
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:52:11
Update: I received the following support response shortly after posting this. I'll update as anything changes.
Apologies for the delay in processing your payout.
We're in the midst of changing from one ACH processor to another, and yours was the first account we could not use with our old provider. We attempted to send it yesterday, but missed the deadline, so have been informed that your payout will go in with today's batch.
We're hopeful that they payment will go through properly, but it's possible it may get held up as we iron out these integration issues.
Apologies again for the delay. If your payment does not go through tonight, I will get an explanation from our processor and keep you informed of its status.

Update: the payment did not go through last night, and I did not receive a status update as noted, so I had to follow up again this afternoon:
Hello again, The payment still did not go through, so I am awaiting an explanation and status as assured.
And received the following response:
I reached out to our ACH vendor this morning to inquire about why the ACH was not processed, and we have received no response or explanation.
I apologize again that we've been unable to process settle the funds to your account in a timely manner. If you wish, we can convert your balance to Bitcoin at current market rates and send them to your wallet.
Otherwise, I will continue to follow up with our ACH processor until the issue is resolved.

Beat me to it. A dude whose ideology is to have no ideology is absolutely sure there are no absolutes...
Except for the things he says, of course.

Apologies. On mobile. Removed immediately. Didn't mean anything by it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:31:18
Of course. But I don't know in which countries it's the easiest. I can only speak as someone living in the US!

I understand why miners try to mine empty blocks in the dead space between blocks. What I don't understand is why the protocol rewards them for doing so in the first place, since it seems they aren't really contributing to the network in a meaningful way when they aren't processing tx fees.
As a side note, I've seen numerous instances of miners (i.e. Antpool) mining empty blocks 30-45 seconds to minutes after the previous block, even though there are significant tx in the mempool. Whether done maliciously or accidentally, it seems like that shouldn't be allowed.

Good point. Seems like that's something that could be ironed out though. But... maybe not.

For a noob... probably Coinbase.
edit: if you're in the US...

I mean to use the term "golden nonce" as used [here]( - essentially meaning one that solves a block.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:52:38
Good explanation, thank you. I was under the impression that even though each node's mempool might be different, the sizes should at least be similar, i.e. within a couple stddevs of each other, and thus it would be determinable as such.
However, your last point sheds the most light on it for me. Since the node has no record of its mempool for historical syncing, it's impossible. 
Cheers. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:17:27
I was thinking the latter ;)
True, each miner has a somewhat different mempool, but shouldn't they be similar, sizewise? I.e. if everyone has a mempool around 90mb and then an empty block came through, that would be a problem.
Or is it often the case that some will have a large mempool and others will have one close to empty?

what?
