It's not about what is being swapped. Without the Fed there wouldn't have been as much demand for all these government bonds and mortgage backed securities therefore housing prices would have fallen and the interest rates on the bonds would have risen. The Fed will eventually unwind (ie. sell) these QE purchases but how much investors are willing to pay for them is anyone's guess.

While a truly free market has yet to exist I don't think Klein understands that on a spectrum the freer the market the wealthier the populace. Capitalism is the best system to reduce overall poverty even if income disparity increases. I find those who focus on income disparity tend to be misguided and it is a red flag that they don't understand economics.

WSJ--By Ken Rogoff


















Many low-income individuals still rely heavily on cash, although of course they aren’t the ones carrying wads of $100s. It wouldn’t cost much to have the government or financial institutions provide them with debit cards. This would also make it simpler, safer and less expensive for the government to make transfer payments. Several Scandinavian countries have already taken this step.


But times are changing. Nowadays, cell towers and large retail stores typically have backup generators, allowing them to process bank cards during a power outage. And there are always checks. In due time, smartphone technology is likely to overtake all other media, and one can always keep a spare charging cell for emergencies. ￼ Perhaps the most challenging and fundamental objection to getting rid of cash has to do with privacy—with our ability to spend anonymously. But where does one draw the line between this individual right and the government’s need to tax and regulate and to enforce the law? Most of us wouldn’t want to clamp down on someone’s right to make the occasional $200 purchase in complete privacy. But what about a $50,000 car or a $1 million apartment? We should be able to reduce the problems I’ve described here while also ensuring that ordinary people can still use small bills for convenience in everyday transactions.

Bitcoin price history tells us that people lose the most money when they realize their gains too early. What will GBTC be at when the price of BTC is 1000$ a coin? 2000$? 10000$? Is it really worth it to realize a 2x gain now and miss out on perhaps a the opportunity of a 10x or 20x move all within the confines of a tax advantaged account?

Central banks create base money known as 'reserves' which can be in electronic form or in paper form commonly referred to as 'dollars' in the US but officially known as 'Federal Reserve Notes'.
Commercial banks create 'credit money' which exist as electronic entries in their customers accounts when they originate loans.
There is far more 'credit money' in the economy than base money. When banks loans go bad their 'credit money' can be purchased by the central bank in exchange for the central bank's 'reserves'. This is what the Quantitative Easing program was all about.
In effect, the main problem with this system is that it is a monopolistic centralized system which can never allocate the real resources of the economy as efficiently compared to a free-market system. Much like the former Soviet Union had a Ministry for every facet of their economy, the US and all other countries, control their economies through the co-ordination of central banking monetary and governmental fiscal policy.
In the end however free-market forces will prevail but I'm not sure how long that will take. I think we're close though.

Hooray for Bitcoin (but Don’t Buy It)
By Lawrence Baxter
Dec. 11, 2017 6:44 p.m. ET
The price of bitcoin broke $19,000 last week, and traders and speculators are giddy. Fortunes are being made. But in the long run, the smart bet is against bitcoin, for at least four reasons.
First, bitcoin is too volatile to be a reliable store of value. National currencies rest on the real productivity and fiscal capacity of citizens. With bitcoin there is no there there—only some kind of euphoric trust. But this trust is undermined by hackers who have breached bitcoin repositories.
Second, the bitcoin community is using breathtaking amounts of electricity—about as much as all of Denmark, according to one recent estimate. The currency is built so that recording transactions, and thereby generating new bitcoin, requires solving complex mathematical problems. This keeps bitcoin scarce, but it also means that massive server farms are tasked with essentially wasteful calculations. When environmentalists begin to understand this, there will be a firestorm.
Third, the currency is a vehicle for criminal transactions and for avoiding government restrictions on moving capital. This is why bitcoin has been so popular in Venezuela and China, and why such countries are cracking down.
Fourth and most important, bitcoin is on a collision course with sovereign states. Bitcoin was founded on a libertarian ethos, and its proponents zealously resist licensing and regulation. Taken to its logical conclusion, this philosophy would entail the elimination of central banks.
So far, the volume of actual bitcoin transactions has been minuscule. Western governments are dozing. But if bitcoin ever grew to critical mass, politicians around the world would wake up.
King Philip IV of France once could not repay his debts to his bankers, the Knights Templar. So in 1307 he had their leaders arrested on trumped-up charges and then burned at the stake. No modern sovereign will give up the power of the purse without a similar fight, if perhaps a less bloody one.
At the first serious (and likely coordinated) move by governments to regulate or bank the digital currency, bitcoin’s price will crash to zero. Panicked owners will rush to exit and the bubble will burst. Bitcoin futures and options may just as well be based on pixies and fairies. Nothing will be able to save them. Speculators will depart for the next lunacy, leaving behind the greater fools to wonder where their supposed wealth went and demand that government do something about it.
All the same, the bitcoin bubble is doing some good. How can this be? The high price of bitcoin, though wildly fluctuating, is attracting attention to the underlying platform, called blockchain. This technology could revolutionize future transactions of many kinds, providing secure execution of “smart contracts,” as well as fast, efficient claims processing that eliminates expensive middlemen.
Eventually those platforms will be stable and secure. But it will take a lot longer than the frenzied bitcoin market suggests. Before this frontier is reached, bitcoin itself—neither stable nor secure—will have crashed to zero.

The greatest levels of growth and increases in standards of living occurred during the 19th century when gold was money. Since the world moved to a fiat standard the most prosperous nations have become less prosperous, workers wages have stagnated, government spending as a percentage of GDP has risen, the financial sector as a percentage of the economy has tripled, and income inequality has widened.
Centrally planned monetary systems are on their way out whether you like it or not. For a minute to minute update on how it's going simply consult any BTC/fiat exchange rate.

What about everything I wrote after "whatever dude"; doesn't that count as part of my response?  
We need money to survive because market prices are the only way to efficiently coordinate society to produce the things people value. Without money and prices, society is left with a bunch of bureaucrats guessing what people value and using brute force to guide production. This centralized solution, manifested in such political ideologies as socialism and communism, has proven disastrous time and time again in terms of both human liberty and well-being.
The outcome of socialism and communism are guaranteed in past, present, and future. So instead of being "sad that we need money to even be able to survive" you should thank your lucky stars that you witnessed the creation of, and can use, the best form of money, Bitcoin, which make life better for all of us.

That is we'd see rising interest rates and mortgage rates. How can an economy that's 20T dollars in debt sustain normalization of interest rates. I don't see this ending well. The Fed is in a box and will cause another recession which they will respond to by lowering interest rates and QE4. I see this as a death spiral with no way out unless government drastically reduces spending which is politically impossible. This is how all fiat currencies end.

I've said it many times before; people can and will passively participate in this monetary revolution without even realizing it. Through their own greed and rational self-interest investors will rush out of fiat and flock into Bitcoin without ever understanding the implications. It is only those interested in monetary theory, like libertarians and Ancaps, who have a clear understanding of where this is all headed, will have the strongest conviction to hodl their coins, and will therefore improve their standard of living the most.  
  
  
The revolution is on autopilot.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:21:56
My analysis is that all the recent buying we saw this week was by large players who plan on shorting BTC on Sunday. They will immediately dump their coins driving the price down and will close their short positions for a tidy fiat profit. They can then use that paper money on the spot markets to accumulate more bitcoins than they would have otherwise been able to because weak hands are panic selling.  
In the long term, I think the futures will ultimately lead to more rapid BTC adoption compared to if the futures contracts were never approved but with the trade off of higher short term volatility.
If you want to win but play it safe, hodl.

**Does this sound like a speculative attack vehicle or is it just me?**
  
  
From the article:
One thing you will notice about that chart is, in addition to being more volatile, the Cboe price is just higher than the "spot" price. (The spot price in this case being Bloomberg's index of bitcoin prices on five exchanges.) Why would you pay $1,000 more for a bitcoin in January than you would for a bitcoin today? One answer is that the Cboe January futures contract doesn't exactly give you a bitcoin in January: It is cash settled, and gives you an amount of dollars equal to the price of a bitcoin on January 17, 2018. If you are the sort of bitcoin dabbler who wants to participate in bitcoin's rally without ever actually touching any bitcoins -- and I suspect a lot of futures investors are -- then this is a very appealing feature. It makes a kind of intuitive sense that more people would want a dollar-settled bitcoin contract than would want actual bitcoins, so the price should be higher. (Though that does rather undermine the notion of bitcoin as a world-dominating currency, doesn't it?) 
Still that is a little unsatisfying. Even if the average investor finds the futures more convenient than bitcoins, someone should be willing to do the arbitrage. Sell futures, borrow dollars, buy bitcoins, and wait; then in January sell the bitcoins, get the dollars, and pay off the futures. You clip $1,000 or so -- about 6 percent of the spot price -- for your trouble.

Is that external motivation really necessary though? Isn't it enough that companies are motivated by profits which they can only obtain by providing what is demanded by their customers? In the case of a Bitcoin bank or exchange consumers want their bitcoins properly secured. Of course there will be failures along the way just as there are failures in regulated markets. The question is which system is more efficient? 
In an externally regulated market, the outside regulators who may not be experts in the field (Lawsky admitted this), are responsible for crafting the rules which may or not be applicable to every business that they believe falls under their purview. By contrast in a market regulated by profit (and fear of losing customers) businesses are responsible for implementing rules that best fit their specific situation. The rules end up being much more granular, cost efficient and fluid.
I'd much rather have a decentralized internal regulatory process than a centralized external one.

History tells us that fiat money is stable over relatively long periods of time until **all of a sudden** it isn't. Some people have referred to this phenomenon as the crack up boom which is related more to human psychology than anything else.
*If once public opinion is convinced that the increase in the quantity of money will continue and never come to an end, and that consequently the prices of all commodities and services will not cease to rise, everybody becomes eager to buy as much as possible and to restrict his cash holding to a minimum size. For under these circumstances the regular costs incurred by holding cash are increased by the losses caused by the progressive fall in purchasing power. The advantages of holding cash must be paid for by sacrifices which are deemed unreasonably burdensome. This phenomenon was, in the great European inflations of the 'twenties, called flight into real goods (Flucht in die Sachwerte) or crack-up boom (Katastrophenhausse).* 
The problem is no one can predict exactly when this lack of confidence will occur. It is important however to be prepared ahead of time so that one isn't "rushing for the exits" at the same time as everyone else. Keeping your long term investments in bonds **at a time when central banks worldwide are engaged in "easy money policies"**, as this author suggests, is risky and poor advice as they will be rendered worthless should hyperinflation hit.

I think the more important question is whether or not they understand what **good** money is. Sure anything that people agree on can serve as money but will that money last? Will that money be valuable in 5 years from now, 10 years, 50, 100? Why or why not will it be valuable and what are the characteristics of money which ensure its long term purchasing power? What types of behaviors, societies, and economies do the different types of monies encourage?

I was talking about the dollar losing all of its value when compared to bitcoins. I can't see one bitcoin being worth 1 million dollars. I think dollars would cease to have any value long before we hit that type of exchange rate. It would be like the last few days of the Weimar hyperinflation when one day a loaf of bread would cost 'x' and the next day (or hour) it would cost '100x'. Eventually exchange rates essentially lose their meaning.

It may not be that there is agenda attached to Bitcoin, but it's characteristics are modeled after those of gold. It is no coincidence or secret that when governments want to expand their control they debase their money and move away from gold backing of their currencies. 
A world with bitcoins as the main form of money will look very different from the one we are living in today. Bitcoin will shape the way people interact with one another, not the other way around.

OK. Thanks for the explanation but I still don't fully understand how the paper market would affect the "physical" bitcoin market. How do a bunch of paper side bets interfere with actual price discovery on exchanges like Bitstamp?  My understanding is that the paper gold market is able to suppress the price of gold because no one actually takes delivery of physical gold. Is there a physical-only gold market equivalent to the bitcoin exchanges? It seems to me that the bitcoin market doesn't have this delivery problem and is much more transparent than the gold market. Thanks for your help.

You're only slaves to the bankers when the bankers can create the money effortlessly. This situation arose when the US government removed all gold backing in 1971.

When these types of questions arise many comments focus on the potential of bitcoin's value going to 0. What is often not discussed is the real risk of not buying bitcoin and subsequently, over the course of the next 6 months-1 year watching the value increase tremendously.

Perhaps Bitcoin was created by the NSA to protect the country from economic ruin should the US dollar collapse.
Gold traditionally served this role but many speculate that the country doesn't have nearly the amount of gold it claims to have.
Jim Rickards' **Currency Wars** opens with a description of a financial war game simulation played at the Pentagon where Rickards played the role of Russia and used gold as an economic weapon against the US.
Perhaps after seeing these results the US got nervous, contracted the services of the Cypherpunks, and created Bitcoin to save the country.
Perhaps Satoshi's 1 million BTC are in cold storage at Ft. Knox!

In reality, the multinational corporations cooperate with the government to develop and enforce policies that favor their agenda. This is how these corporations are able to become so powerful. Corporations are able to limit our freedoms, not on their own, but by only through leveraging the body politic and backing by government force. Without this government backing, corporations would have to operate in a free market and be beholden to their customers who could at anytime take their business elsewhere. The corporations would be our slaves, not vice versa.

A quote from Offit Capital Advisors in this article (and numerous other haters):


Why do people think that a store of value has to be stable. In order to be a store of value an asset must either retain its value or appreciate in value over time regardless of stability. Bitcoin has done this  better than any other asset on the planet over the past 5 years.

All of Bitcoin's properties can be re-created very easily by copying or tweaking the computer code as the enormous number of similar, yet vastly less popular, alt cryptocurrencies show . Therefore, neither cryptography, nor it's properties of money actually "back" Bitcoin or give it value.
What backs Bitcoin is trust. 
Bitcoin has a huge distributed network of miners and hashing power which secures the coins from being forged (double spent). No other cryptocurrency comes close to Bitcoin's network. Without that hashing power there would be no reason to have any confidence or trust in Bitcoin as a currency or store of value.

Well, if he is talking about banks he is incorrect. According to the Bank of England deposits do not create loans but rather loans create deposits! As crazy as it sounds, when one obtains a mortgage or any other loan, the bank creates the loan out of thin air and deposits the money (credit money not cash) into your bank account. The loan is now an asset of the bank and the deposit in your account is their liability. The banks never have to wait for savers to deposit money to make loans. Step  "a person gives money to the bank" is not necessary. Also, the banks are not limited by a magical 10% fractional reserve ratio. There is no mandated fractional reserve.

Yes, China would lend us gold backed money but it would be at much higher interest rates. Today, these interest rates are kept artificially low through measures like Quantitative Easing (aka debt monetization/money printing)
When a system is based on fiat currencies the politically expedient thing to do to pay off the enormous debts is to inflate it away by printing money. This is a hidden tax which greatly effects fixed income earners (typically low and middle income earners). Inflation, which is limited by having a currency linked to a commodity like gold or bitcoins, is far more palatable than the transparency of direct taxation of the citizens. If politicians had to pay for their spending only by raising taxes there would be far greater constraints on spending. Fiat currencies and the ability to inflate them are the great enablers of big governments. This is why I started to whole post in the first place. Bitcoin, like gold, would limit the size of government. I don't think there is any conspiracy or boogeyman. I just think that the system is ill-designed.

Here is additional context from your quoted thread:
"I don't understand how having more payment options causes people to donate less. Maybe someone can explain?"
Wales' answer:
"Well, it's a fact. The art and science of landing page design involves, as it turns out, lots of things that are counter-intuitive. But I think the main basic principle is that once someone has decided to donate, any complications of any kind causes a significant portion of them to bounce."
Wales adds:
"I speak of the general principle. It might not hold true for BTC, but I think that's extremely extremely unlikely. Indeed, BTC is just the sort of highly interesting thing that would distract people a lot." 
From the above it is likely that Wales is quoting some general market research study which found that when people are presented with more payment options they donate less. This seems to be a reasonable assumption and conclusion. However, I still doubt that any specific analysis has been done as to the impact on donations when a single additional Bitcoin option is added to an already cluttered Wikipedia donations landing page. How would they know the effects if they hadn't tested their theory in "the wild" for a certain amount of time.

In the past inflation was defined as an increase in the supply of money ie. monetary inflation. More recently inflation has been redefined as, and generally understood as, an increase in prices ie price inflation.
There is not an smooth linear relationship between the amount of money created and prices. That is, if you create 10% more money not all of the individual prices in the economy will rise by 10%. What is true is that prices will be higher than they would have been absent the money creation. The stock market may rise 30% while housing may rise only 5%. In additon, other prices like consumer electronics prices may fall by only 5% instead of having decreased by 10%. This is a relative price inflation even though the actual prices are decreasing! 
All in all, individual prices depend on how the marketplace and government use the money while the general price level will be higher than it would have been absent the monetary inflation.

One could more reasonably argue that Bitcoin doesn't have a long enough history to prove itself as a store of value but volatility in and of itself doesn't exclude an asset from being a store of value as long as the long term trend is upwards.
From your last paragraph it seems as the only store of value that meets your definition are very short term government securities or cash.

But what happens when 2 hours later the price drops to $900 dollars? Is my stop loss now at $720? That obviously can't be how it works as the stop loss would never get triggered.

Scams and catastrophes will always occur. The question is: "Under what type of system will those losses be minimized?". Clearly failures like LTCM, Enron, Bernie Madoff, and MF Global highlight the enormous losses which occur with centralized regulatory schemes.
I believe that decentralized market regulations will be more beneficial to consumers in the long run than any centralized government based regulation. Consumers will be more prudent with their money without an implied guarantee from taxpayers. For profit businesses will have to establish best practices in order to allay those consumers fears and earn their trust.

I'd like to see a a music service where artists actually get paid on a per song basis. The artist themselves should be able to choose how much they charge per song. Heck even different songs by the same artist could have different pricing. More established artists could charge a premium while new artists would likely give away their music for free until they built up some type of listener base. I'd be interested to know what the average cost per track would be and how much users would spend on average over the course of a year. Users would have bitcoin accounts from which funds would be automatically drawn as songs are played. There could be filters such that the user chooses to listen or search for tracks in a certain price range. The hosting services like Spotify/Grooveshark would obviously get their cut as well.

OK, so let me get this straight. 
The 1970s brought us:
1. Transparent voting in Congress enabling legislation to be influenced by lobbyists.
2. Removal of gold backing of the currency allowing for funding and execution of that legislation.
James makes a great observation. Nontheless, I think both of the above changes were necessary. Transparency alone is not sufficient to create the fiscal/monetary mess we're currently in. Without fiat currency, government would not be able to fund the poor policies absent significantly increased taxation.

I don't get the comparisons of being able to scale to the size of the Visa network. If Bitcoin is to be used for micropayments, reducing spam emails, and acting a replacement for cash the total number of tranasctions will dwarf those of Visa and Mastercard combined. The need for off-chain type transactions will always be necessary to fulfill Bitcoin's role as a medium of exchange. 
Increasing the blocksize will simply make it more difficult for individuals to act as nodes. Without this robust decentralized network Bitcoin is more vulnerable to government intrusion and loses most of its appeal as a store of value.
I'm not a technical guy so correct me if I'm wrong but it seems as if this debate boils down to a tradeoff between increasing on-chain scalability at the expense of a less resilient, more centralized network. I don't think we should ever sacrifice the latter for the former especially when off-chain transactions can mitigate scalability.
Bitcoin isn't about a near free payment system as much as it's about a transparent, scarce, digital money that can't be co-opted.

The BTC blockchain must be kept as secure and distributed as possible. Off-chain transactions will allow for scalability while the blockchain will force third parties like Circle and Coinbase to remain honest and accountable. I'll gladly pay fees to these third parties who can then aggregate them with other customers fees to pay the miners.

His case is compelling and backed by a lot of data and rational thought. The basic premise is that gold will serve as the world's reserve asset as opposed to government issued debt/US dollars. He estimates a gold price of around $55,000 an ounce. He also predicts that gold's price will fall prior to a sudden revaluation once large buyers are unable to obtain significant amounts of physical gold. He also discusses Bitcoin in some of his posts.

That still doesn't explain your comment that "the dollar currency would vanish" if "all bank debts were paid off". I don't believe this is correct. If all bank debts were paid off the money supply would no doubt shrink due to the contraction of credit money however Federal Reserve Notes would still exist. The fact that these physical notes were created by a printing press is immaterial. 
Theoretically, there is nothing wrong with using a fixed supply of infinitely divisible paper currency as money. Practically, it is impossible because governments and central banks can't be trusted to not to print more.

If they lie then that is fraud and they can be taken to court. Regulations do not prevent fraud. If no one is allowed to look at their books and their is no transparency then investors should not keep their money with those companies. There will be enough competition because there is significant demand from customers for these services. If there were only one company offering quality, audited, and transparent services then that company would enjoy huge profits which would encourage other companies to enter the space for a share of those profits.

Although not all bitcoin businesses currently show proof of reserves I believe that in the future market forces (and not Ben Lawsky) will encourage the best companies to do so.

Of course, the long term success of the company is grounded in the quality of the product. 
I think the BTC Foundation should consider putting together a powerful 30 sec spot highlighting the problems BTC solves.

Bitcoins that you hold in a wallet that you yourself control have no counterparty risk. The minute you entrust those bitcoins to someone else to hold you introduce counterparty risk. 
The same can be said for gold or even US dollars. The difference is that it is much harder to devalue gold/bitcoins compared to fiat currencies like the dollar. Even if you held dollars in your own wallet and and are protected from counterparty risk there is still the risk of devaluation of purchasing power through inflation.

I believe that the medium of exchange function can be served by off chain transactions using an analogy to gold.
In the past, gold coins were replaced by paper gold certificates seeing as the later was a more convenient medium of exchange compared to carrying around cumbersome metal. Settlement would occur when the gold certificates were redeemed for actual gold held at the bank.
In the same vein, I see no urgent need to increase block sizes. Off chain transactions could substitute for the gold certificates and settlement of the transactions could occur at the end of the day.
The key advantage that Bitcoin has over gold is transparency. The concerns of banks not holding enough gold reserves is a moot point with Bitcoin's proof of reserves and publicly visible blockchain. 
In addition, although Bitcoin may be more scalable than it is currently, comparisons to the Visa network volumes are inadequate. If bitcoins are to be used for microtransactions such as buying a cup of coffee, preventing spam emails, and internet tipping the number of transactions will likely dwarf Visa.
For me, having a secure and transparent store of value that is of limited supply (and acts as golden handcuffs preventing profligate government spending) coupled with a scalable, off chain medium of exchange is currently the best solution.

Perhaps, eventually, they decide to have Paypal, Circle, Bitpay, and Coinbase form some giant megabitcoin firm to make it really easy for consumers to use Bitcoin. They make steady profits taking a very small percentage on huge volumes and consumers are better off with lower transaction fees compared to what traditional banks and credit cards offered in the past.

All of the reactionary fixes and adjustments that you mention are a direct result of prior poor monetary policies by the Fed.
Interest rates had to be raised to combat the inflation which was a direct result of loose monetary policy by that very same Central Bank earlier in the decade. As Milton Friedman says: "inflation is always a monetary phenomenon".
This is all a rehash of Austrian/free market vs. Keynesian/centrally controlled economics.  Price fixing is central planning. Whether you are the fixing the price of wheat, oil, the minimum wage or the price of money itself via interest rates it is all central planning and distorting free market forces.

While I believe that Apple is making the wrong business decision by shunning bitcoin related apps it is well within their rights to do so.

Apple users are free to switch devices if they feel the benefits of bitcoin outweigh the benefits of Apple's products. There is no coercion or force on Apple's part. 
Also, Apple was capable of keeping Flash out of their ecosystem because they created fantastic products that many consumers decided outweighed the loss of Flash functionality. Unfortunately for them they will not have this leverage on Bitcoin in the long term. Bitcoin is not Flash. Bitcoin will be bigger than Apple.

As opposed to a technical point of view, it is important to also look at the problem from a monetary point of view. I see Bitcoin's main function as serving as the foundation of the monetary system much as gold was in the past. If more full nodes means a more secure Bitcoin network then this should not be sacrificed in the name of greater numbers of transactions per second. Off-chain transactions can serve this role. There are other ways that off-chain 3rd party providers can be kept honest. Being able to anchor the world's economy to a scarce digital cryptocurrency standard would go a long way to solving many problems, but that digital gold must be as secure as possible.

He also argues that because there are so many alt currencies the actual supply of digital currencies is not capped at a finite limit.

Here are the facts as I and many others see them:
Money must have certain properties which include being durable, divisible, fungible, portable and most importantly be of finite supply. There are very few things on this planet that can fill the role of money. Stuffed animals like Beanie Babies and stocks like Pets.com do not have many of these properties. Cryptocurrencies on the other hand have all of these properties. As you know, the role of money over the course of millenia, and as selected by the market, have been filled by gold and silver until relatively recently.  Over the past few decades paper fiat currencies, completely devoid of any backing whatsoever, have been used as money with what many recognize as disastorous consequences.
I maintain that because of their properties cryptocurrencies are a new form of money well suited for a digital age and will be embraced over the course of years to come. You are free to cling to your precious paper fiat currency and enjoy the effects of quantitative easing.

By MATTHEW DALTON And  ANDREW GROSSMAN
Updated Nov. 7, 2014 7:44 p.m. ET
Law enforcement authorities across Europe and the U.S. shut dozens of illegal websites and arrested some operators, employing new and as yet unknown techniques to unmask those using an anonymity network.
Authorities said on Friday they made the arrests by piercing the anonymity offered by Tor, a network that relies on encryption tools and 1,000s of servers to mask online activities. Tor, which is partly funded by the U.S. government, is used by dissidents in authoritarian countries such as Iran, China and Saudi Arabia to access the Internet, but people operating and visiting websites that sell contraband also use it to conceal their identities.
Internet security experts said it was unlikely authorities had cracked Tor’s sophisticated encryption protocols. “If that were the case, the implications would be huge,” said an official with Welund Horizon, a London firm that provides intelligence on cybercrime to law-enforcement agencies and large corporations.
That law enforcement was able to locate Tor users is “a game changer,” said Ulf Bergstrom, a spokesman for Eurojust, the European Union’s legal coordination agency. “You’re not anonymous anymore when you’re using Tor.”
Authorities are continuing to target other so-called “darknet” websites that traffic in illegal goods and their customers, said Troels Oerting, director of the European Cybercrime Centre in The Hague, which with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Justice Department directed this week’s actions.
The Tor Project Inc., a nonprofit group behind Tor, said it doesn’t know exactly how investigators located the users. Court documents and statements made public this week “don’t disclose enough details to be useful for technical diagnosis,” said Andrew Lewman, executive director of the Tor Project. “We’re continuing to investigate.”
“This could all be simple old-fashioned police work in action,” he said.
Mr. Lewman added his organization doesn’t condone the use of Tor for illegal activities.
A U.S. official involved in the investigation said this week’s actions were targeted at online marketplaces for contraband, not the Tor network. “People felt like Tor is all I need to be safe, so after that they were pretty open about” illegal activity, the official said.“We’re still working very hard and it certainly hasn’t become easy,” the official said. “But I think we do want people to be aware that we will work very hard and we will overcome that obstacle in order to stop serious crime.”
While law enforcement is more adept at tracking down Tor users, challenges remain.
Authorities seized 414 website domains that provide access to marketplaces for illegal drugs, weapons and even contract killers, said Eurojust. Authorities arrested 17 people connected to the websites and seized computers, bitcoins worth $1 million and €180,000 ($224,000) in cash, drugs, gold and silver.
The crackdown ensnared Blake Benthall, a California man who was arrested on Wednesday and charged with owning and operating Silk Road 2.0., one of the largest darknet marketplaces. In addition to the arrest of Mr. Benthall, 16 others have been arrested in the probe, including two people in California, two in Sweden, one in Ireland, eight in the U.K., one in Spain, one in Switzerland and one in Hungary, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department said.
“This case is a landmark in the continuing battle against cybercrime,” said Koen Hermans, a Dutch official who works with Eurojust. “It marks the beginning, not the end, of the pursuit of those who abuse the Internet for illegal profit.”
Some of the larger darknet marketplaces remained online Friday, including Evolution, the expert from Welund Horizon said. In an indication of how difficult policing the darknet is, one of the marketplaces that may have been shut down, Alpaca, was up and running again on Friday through a different host, the expert said.
“We’ll probably see Silk Road reappearing very soon,” the expert said.
Tor hides users’ identities by detouring their traffic around the world before it reaches its final destination. It also is used to skirt censors in countries such as China. Privacy-minded researchers, crooks and spies have long probed Tor for weaknesses.
Tor stands for “the onion router.” It is managed by a nonprofit group in Cambridge, Mass., and worked on by a dispersed group of programmers. It was originally developed to protect the communications of the U.S. Navy and still is partly funded by the U.S. government. Because of Tor, the identities of the web-companies and servers that host dark websites are supposed to be impossible to locate.
Officials wouldn’t comment on how authorities got around Tor. Arrests are coming of those who buy goods from these websites, Mr. Oerting said. “They’ll get a knock on their doors,” he said. “That will not be the milkman, that will be the police.”
The sites shut include Hydra and Cannabis Road, Eurojust said. Thursday’s arrests focused on websites that sell drugs and weapons, Mr. Oerting said.

I think this is just how evolution works. It takes time and end-to-end Bitcoin adoption isn't going to happen all at once or quickly; it's going to occur in fits and starts, 2 steps forwards and one step back; just like the price of bitcoin has been rising in stages with occasional booms and busts. The mainstream players will build out their bitcoin-fiat thing while other more "fringe developers" will focus on a complete ecosystem. Eventually, over the course of years or maybe even decades, the loop will close. OTOH, if there is another economic crisis, end to end adoption would happen relatively suddenly. The important point, IMHO, is that Bitcoin is a superior currency that will supplant the current system.

I think that Bitcoin's success is in part due to people's fear. Fear that this time may be different. 
Fear that what happened in 2008 has not yet resolved. A feeling of uneasiness related to a world where billions have given way to trillions. Trillions in deficits, trillions in debt. Concerns over what would happen to governments with record debts should interest rates rise. Rumblings about manipulation of interest rates like LIBOR and manipulations of gold markets. Oddities like Germany asking for their gold back and not really getting any or a CPI which doesn't quite seem to jive with personal experiences at the grocery store.
Perhaps those in charge of the world's financial system do have things under control and the world will improve over the next decade on a stable "glide path".
But maybe it won't. Maybe it is impossible to "paper over" real problems. Maybe the crisis of 2008 has just been laying dormant and is just the harbinger of an even bigger crisis. A crisis that has its genesis in excessive money printing. A crisis that has afflicted many other nations over the course of our own lifetimes. Perhaps when you have the world's reserve currency you can get away with these transgressions. But maybe you can't. 
Maybe it isn't different this time.

This is a great question. Why hasn't anarchy (anarcho-capitalism) happened yet if it is the "way to go"?
Time travel is also a great idea. Why hasn't that happened yet? Well because we don't have the technology to time travel.
Similarly, I believe that an anarcho-capitalist society hasn't happened yet because we, up until now, haven't had the right money. Control of the money supply is likely the linchpin which allows certain privileged individuals to establish and maintain their power at the expense of the others. 
Bitcoin returns the control of money back to individuals. Gold used to serve this role but it seems to have failed due to a lack of transparency. Bitcoin does not have this problem as it does not need to be stored in vaults and is infinitely more portable and can be audited with ease.
It will be very interesting to see how this whole experiment plays out.

They can't use the Bitcoin network without the bitcoin currency but keep in mind that they aren't referring to the Bitcoin blockchain per se. They are talking about blockchain technology in the generic sense. They will probably want to promote something along the lines of Ripple to move fiat around more efficiently.

In a free market, exchanges would have to build their reputations and trust over time. Those people who are more risk-taking would use the exchanges first while more cautious users would wait. Initially, different exchanges would having differing sets of guidelines and practices, to ensure the safety of customer funds. Over time the best practices would become apparent and incorportated into most of the exchanges. This natural process would take time but would likely lead to the most effective and cost efficient set of regulations which would also evolve over time. One can never prevent all fraud, but the above "free market regulations" would work and is already taking place absent government input.

My understanding is that BTC banks that have 100% backing are actually more like vaults/safety deposit boxes and would have to charge fees to their customers.

Gold is much more easily manipulated than bitcoins because it is much more difficult to take physical delivery. This leads to the necessity of storage by a third party and with that comes counterparty risk.

I don't know how you can make such a statement after witnessing how a new technology over the span of only 20 years has dramatically altered the way in which the world communicates. Think about how other inventions and discoveries over the course of history have had similar ground breaking effects: the wheel, the printing press, electricity, the telephone, the airplane etc. I would put the invention of the blockchain/cryptocurrency in that same category.
If a new invention benefits society it will be adopted and supplant the older less efficient technologies. Despite the control that governments worldwide currently have over the monetary system I believe that ultimately it is the people who determine what will be used as money. This adoption may not happen overnight, or even in the next 10 years, but it will happen.

Real Ponzi schemes don't have residual value. There was still value there and people saw it. In fact, the price was beginning to rise again from a new base. That's when I thought that there was more to Bitcoin than I had originally imagined and started to do some more research at places like bitcointalk.org. Well, that basic pattern of bubble formation followed by establishing a new base seems to be happening again yet these so called experts still fail to appreciate it and don't seem to have researched the technology enough.

I'm not sure if you were attempting to support or deny my claim but this quote by CP is exactly the "rope-a-dope" strategy. He's saying play it cool and play by the rules early in the game because once Bitcoin becomes established it will be impossible to dismantle.
Also, I don't know how people can separate Bitcoin from libertarianism.  Bitcoin is designed very much with the properties of gold in mind. Non-inflationary, non-fiat money like gold is at the heart of both Austrian economics and libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism because it greatly limits the powers of centralized governments. Marked government deficit spending which has been happening worldwide will be made much more difficult if not impossible.

What upset many in the Bitcoin community about Krugman is the fact that he advocates a monetary system which based on force while he opposes Bitcoin which is a monetary system based on freedom.
For example...
[Taken from Krugman's "Bitcoin is Evil"](


BitCoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind—to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions.

Theoretically governments that are on a pure gold standard, where their currencies are redeemable for a fixed weight of gold, are limited in their spending by how much gold they possess. It is for this exact reason that convertibility to gold was halted during WWI to fund the war. 
During WWII and thereafter, the US for example, was not on a pure gold standard as currency was not redeemable for gold by the public.
"Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard."

You're looking at the problem through your own lens however the majority of Americans aren't as fortunate as you are. They don't pay off their CC at the end of the month; they carry balances forward. As interest rates rise they won't be able to afford credit and will have to move to cash equivalents. OTOH, if interest rates don't rise there will be increased price inflation with a decreased issuance of credit and the incentive for people to shift from USD to BTC to protect purchasing power.

I'm not sure if I understand your comment here and want to clarify in case you have a misperception. When you use the word "conversion" it makes me think that you believe that GBTC will convert into the ETF. This is not the case. The ETF and GBTC are completely separate products.
With that out of the way, I think that the current premium reduction is the opposite of what many believe. I think that the premium is disappearing because holders of GBTC are selling thinking that the BTC price will drop following a disapproval of the ETF. If the ETF is rejected I can see the price of BTC falling in the short term (0-6 weeks) along with the price of GBTC, with a subsequent increase in the price of both in the intermediate term (1-3 months).
If the ETF is approved I can see the price of both BTC and GBTC increasing significantly while the premium of GBTC disappears.
Good luck with your investment!

Despite Mt. Gox's failure, I don't agree with Allaire's comments regarding the need for government regulations. Allaire's comments make me question his underlying character and true motives.
Bitcoin entrepreneurs are smart enough to establish their own robust and transparent systems to protect funds and earn customer confidence and trust. Government regulations are burdensome and often nonsensical and outdated. Government regulators couldn't even protect Madoff's victims when they were told he was running a Ponzi scheme by [Harry Markopolos] ( over the course of 9 years! 
No matter how well intentioned, government regulations will certainly drive up the costs to consumers and over the long term won't offer as much protection as those established within the Bitcoin community.

Ultra wealthy individuals store their value in collectibles like art work, antiques, vintage cars, real estate, and gold. None of those are used as a currency. They are all similar to Bitcoin in that they are scarce and in demand. One difference,  is that BTC has all the characteristics which are important for a money to have such as divisibility, portability, durability, a high value to weight ratio, etc. It's similar to gold in this respect but seems to fall short for now in fungibility but is superior in terms of portability and 'auditibility'. Even without a blocksize limit I fail to see how all global transactions can happen on chain. Additional layers will have to be built on top of a store of value on-chain Bitcoin base to help serve the currency role. If this doesn't strike you as a game changing advancement in human history I suggest you review the history of gold and why governments found it necessary to confiscate their citizens' bullion and move to a purely fiat standard. Wealth inequality worsens under a fiat standard forcing governments to become 'redistribution centers' and government officials to have far too much power. I fully expect the wealth distribution of bitcoins to become less concentrated over time as long as new units cannot be created out of thin air by a central body.

Yes, it is possible that even with no block size limit, the free market would choose smaller block sizes than we currently have. It's unfortunate that a limit was ever put in place but given that there is one I perceive the risks of a hard fork outweigh the benefits of removing the limit **at the current time**. There may come a time years or decades from now when removing the limit is non-contentious. I think part of the problem is that Bitcoin may be a project that lasts centuries and that it is relatively short sighted to try and force through significant changes to the protocol in the first few years of its existence. Maybe a few hundred years from now people will look back and say to themselves: "Wow, those early adopters were really impatient".

If Bitcoin becomes co-opted by government then what is the incentive to use, mine, or exchange fiat for coins and wealth preservation? Where do the utility and the value come from? A co-opted Bitcoin, a Bitcoin whose value will be attempted to be maintained through government decree, is one whose value will quickly fall to zero.  No government can mandate value. If that were the case fiat currencies would never hyperinflate.


Yes, I believe in markets. I believe that distributed systems will ultimately prevail over centrally controlled structures (although it may take longer than either of us hoped).

Yes but if 0.5x people are willing to pay 3x more then you also have an increase in revenue. It works both ways. It seems you were only assuming that there will be an incentive for higher transaction volume when you said:


Clearly this isn't true as we see above. Miner revenue can be increased either with smaller or larger blocks. There is no reason to believe that miners will want or need larger block sizes. Similarly, the elites may not want increased on-chain liquidity if the tradeoff is a less secure network with fewer nodes. 
I believe both yourself (I think) and Justus Ranvier have made the argument that the whole block size limit issue should be abandoned and that there should be a market determined block size. This makes sense to me however I am very concerned that should the block size increase and node count drop it would make the network vulnerable to attack by malicious actors from which Bitcoin may not recover. I am hoping that all stakeholders understand both sides of this important issue.

Because all state money is currently fiat. This monetary system was thought to be necessary, has enabled more centralized decision making, and has been kept in place in part by the demonetization of gold. I believe with the inventions of the internet and Bitcoin the world is on the path to a more decentralized social structure.

I don't think you need inflation to force people to invest. If the investment opportunity has a projected greater return on your money you would make the investment.

With larger block sizes we also run into problems of the network being controlled by only a few entities capable of running full nodes. This centralization makes the Bitcoin and its value vulnerable to attack by groups wanting to see its demise. If the blocksizes are so big that we only have a few nodes the BTC that you hold in your own bank will be more vulnerable losing value.  
BTC is much more transparent than gold making audits that much easier. 
E-wallet providers will have to build their reputations and establish best practices in order to earn trust and prove to their customers that they have the BTC backing their deposits.
There are a lot of smart people on both sides of this debate but a hard fork at this stage of the game is very unsettling.

Fiat currency like the US dollar is created while bitcoins are discovered.
The Federal Reserve doesn't print money anymore. They credit banks by literally typing whatever they want int their accounts. If the Fed wanted to create a trillion dollars they type "1,000,000,000,000" and it's done. There is no theoretical limit on how much they can create.
Mining for bitcoins requires effort. Maybe not physical effort like we traditionally associate with mining gold, but rather computing effort. No matter how much effort/computing power one devotes to mining only a limited number of bitcoins can be discovered according to the protocol. (Currently 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes).

[Here is your recent discussion (18 hours ago)]( Your comments are bolded.
Would it suddenly be wrong to drink alcohol because the government declared it illegal?
**Again, the question is not whether or not it's wrong or not. That's totally irrelevant.**
So should a jury send someone to prison because they broke the law even though they didn't actually do anything wrong?
**Laws aren't a question of what's right or wrong. What you might feel is wrong someone else might feel is right, and vice versa. If more people agree that something is worth punishing because they want to create disincentive for it, they make laws against that. They can also overturn those laws if enough people change their opinion on that subject. That's how our society operates.**
Would you feel good about yourself sending someone to prison who broke the law but didn't actually do anything wrong?
**See above.**
Let me ask you this: knowing what you know now, if you were sitting on a jury during a trial over someone harboring slaves during the time that the fugitive slave laws were in effect, and he admitted to doing it, would you send him to prison for it?
**Again, that's neither here nor there. Even if I disagreed with the law, the jury isn't the place for me to do it.
Look, I know a lot of people conflate politics and law but they're two separate entities when it comes to a court and courts try to separate the two so that everyone gets equal treatment under the law. If you bring your ideologies into a court, you're not going to make a decision as a juror but rather as an activist. And that's not appropriate.
That's something you and others here need to understand. Law isn't about right or wrong or fair and unfair. It's supposed to be as impartial as possible.**

It doesn't have to be relative to the available pool of goods and services.
Inflation is simply an increase in the money supply which then leads to an increase in the general price level relative to where it would have been absent this monetary increase. Prices may even go down with inflation, but they would have gone down even more absent the money printing. In addition, price inflation may manifest in prices of goods, services and assets. Many people believe that the increase in asset prices (stock market, government bonds, real estate) that  we see today are the direct result of the Federal Reserve's inflationary QE policies.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:20:15
I don't think the term "backed by" is appropriate though. The US gov. can guarantee the dollar's use as a currency but can't guarantee its purchasing power. If governments could guarantee exchange value we would never have hyperinflationary events.

Well personally speaking I think that bankers are not evil at all but rather it is the monetary system itself that is flawed. I believe that when currency is not tied to a hard asset like gold that there is too much pressure on central bankers to enable profligate spending by governments. Despite claiming to be independent [recent comments by Greenspan] ( support what many have known for quite some time. We have gotten ourselves into quite a debt problem since going full fiat in 1971. Excessive debt has led to multiple bubbles and malinvestment as explained by the Austrian business cycle theory.
Nontheless, the linked article does more than suggest that cryptocurrencies pose a threat, or at least a marked change to how banking would be done should they gain enough "marketshare". I believe banks will continue to serve a critical, albeit less central role in society, if a crypto world comes to fruition.

I don't want to be part of any government experiments. The optimal way to structure society has changed over the centuries and it is highly unlikely that it won't continue to evolve over time. I don't believe that the current structure of partitioned lands with territorial monopolies on legislation, immigration, and security is optimal. This structure is currently a global phenomenon and is in no way represents a 'free-market' for government services. There is a better way, a social organization more grounded in personal freedoms, that will and is being pursued.

Using your logic because the majority of the German people supported the Nazis and their ideals the Nuremberg laws and holocaust are justifiable.


Yes, but each individual should all be able to exist whereby the laws are in alignment with their morals. That is what polycentric law hopes to achieve while our current system thrusts the morals of the majority upon the minority.




It's the opposite of nations. A nation, or a territory within a nation, has a monopoly on law. In polycentric law, different groups of people **within the same territory** are subject to different laws depending upon which legal agencies they subscribe to. Here is more info:

University of Montreal - School of Criminology
May 13, 2014
Abstract:     
The online cryptomarket Silk Road has been oft-characterised as an ‘eBay for drugs’ with customers drug consumers making personal use-sized purchases. Our research demonstrates that this was not the case. Using a bespoke web crawler, we downloaded all drugs listings on Silk Road in September 2013. We found that a substantial proportion of transactions on Silk Road are best characterised as ‘business-to-business’, with sales in quantities and at prices typical of purchases made by drug dealers sourcing stock. High price-quantity sales generated between 31-45% of revenue, making sales to drug dealers the key Silk Road drugs business. As such, Silk Road was what we refer to as a transformative, as opposed to incremental, criminal innovation. With the key Silk Road customers actually drug dealers sourcing stock for local street operations, we were witnessing a new breed of retail drug dealer, equipped with a technological subcultural capital skill set for sourcing stock. Sales on Silk Road increased from an estimate of $14.4 million in mid 2012 to $89.7 million by our calculations. This is a more than 600% increase in just over a year, demonstrating the demand for this kind of illicit online marketplace. **With Silk Road functioning to considerable degree at the wholesale/broker market level, its virtual location should reduce violence, intimidation and territorialism. Results are discussed in terms of the opportunities cryptomarkets provide for criminologists, who have thus far been reluctant to step outside of social surveys and administrative data to access the world of ‘webometric’ and ‘big data’.**

If the block size is not increased then transaction fees will rise which will generate more revenues and profits for miners.
These increased mining profits will act as a market signal and attract more mining/hashing power thereby strengthening the foundation of the Bitcoin network and making it less vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors. Hashing power is the only property of Bitcoin which can't be duplicated easily by any altcoin. This is Bitcoin's "moat" as Warren Buffett would say.
An increase in the block size will also lead to increased mining profits and hash rate but will split the mining hashing power between the 2 chains in ways that are unpredictable and potentially lead to 2 networks which are more vulnerable to attack.
I would like to wait and see what happens when the current block limit is reached and observe how the fees, off-chain solutions, and remainder of the system reacts. 
Let's not create a solution for a problem that may not even exist.

Here is part of the conclusion of the paper you cited:


in the blocks themselves? The reason is the following. When a miner tries to solve a block,
the transactions are already in the network. In this case, he is a Stackelberg follower and
he has an incentive to include all transactions in the limitless block he tries to solve. He
could announce before solving a block that if he indeed solves a block, he will not include
all transactions. But this announcement would not be credible. Indeed, since miners
are in competition with distributed hashing power, the transactions a miner would not
include would certainly be included just ten minutes later by another miner. Including all
transactions whatever the fee attached is the only subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of
the game we described.
and your quote from above:


Now, I'm no expert but it is my understanding that there is a very real cost of adding additional transactions to blocks and that is the risk of having the block orphaned given that bandwidth in the system is limited. By adding transactions and having larger blocks miners risk missing out on the BTC block reward.

Right on, prices are useful. I thought the most interesting observation made by the OP was that "higher fee transactions were not delayed". 
Also, eventually all of the transactions cleared. Wasn't this something that Mike Hearn was worried about? Something about the mempool? I'd assume that if people's transactions were stuck they would resubmit them with a higher fee. It seems like this whole blocksize issue is more philosophical than technical.

The whole raising the block limit debate reminds me of this baseball quote:

@_date: 2015-01-12 06:02:20
Ultimately, this boils down to the "store of value" vs. "medium of exchange" vs. "both" debate. 
It is not necessarily true that people will stop using Bitcoin if transaction fees are too high. People will stop using bitcoins if they have no value. Also note by using I am implying as either a store of value or as a medium of exchange. (Think of this situation as similar to gold where it has maintained its value over centuries yet it is rarely "used". Rather most gold today sits undisturbed in vaults being used as a store of value.) Bitcoin's value is currently "backed" by the network's hashing power. Increasing the block size will put this value at risk as miners will have to decide how to divide their resources among the 2 protocols.
Off-chain solutions with trusted third parties or a system like Open Transactions will hopefully allow for scalability. If not, I am happy to exchange my valuable bitcoins for fiat and use the traditional systems to make purchases. 
Don't get me wrong. I would love to use Bitcoin as both a store of value and a medium of exchange but I don't think that it's worth taking the risk until we see how things play out with the current limit and off chain solutions.
As an aside, my understanding is that coins on the "old" Bitcoin network will always be compatible with the "new" network but not vice versa. If this is the case then the "old" coins should trade at a premium compared to the "new" ones. It would be interesting to see how this dynamic would play out and how much hashing power miners would devote to each of the 2 protocols. Maybe the old network becomes the store of value network and the new one serves the medium of exchange role. Personally, if there is a block size limit increase I'll be holding tight on the "old" network for awhile.

We seem to have a difference of opinion regarding the importance of legality and democracy on the one hand, and ethics and morality on the other. When the two come into conflict I value the latter over the former.

@_date: 2015-01-18 05:53:20
The whole idea of polycentric law was clearly summarized in the link I provided yet you dismissed it because it was written by a no name law student in a non peer reviewed journal. 
You keep on coming back to the point that if I don't like the current laws I should go through the democratic process of changing it while I continue to make the argument that morality trumps democracy and that a polycentric law allows for different sets of laws for different groups of people who share similar moral values. In addition, the manner in which disputes between people who elect to follow different laws is discussed in the paper and citations. This is not a difficult concept to understand yet you fail to grasp it because you are the one in the echo chamber and who is ossified in your ideologies. The democratic process is inherently flawed as it imposes the morals of the majority upon the minority. Historical examples of immoral laws have been pointed out to you in other posts yet you continue to push your agenda of law trumping morality at any and all expense.
Good luck trying to figure it out on your own.

I agree for the most part but I wouldn't get too focused on the whole middleman issue. I believe Bitcoin's key characteristics are its limited supply and that it can't be produced or issued by any central authority. These are very different attributes compared to schemes like M-Pesa and Ripple. 
If Bitcoin is to scale and be used as a medium of exchange, while at the same time not compromising its core properties, I think there will be a need for trustworthy, accountable middlemen to assist in the payments arena.

There is nothing inherently wrong with speculation or gambling. Everyone has different risk tolerances. With high risk comes the chance of having a high reward.
I believe in the long term success of Bitcoin and am willing to take the large risks to reap those potential large rewards. Holding bitcoins for the "shortest time possible" as you recommend is poor advice for someone like me. I see Bitcoin as more than just an intermediary currency/payment mechanism. As mentioned by u/cypherdoc I also believe bitcoins can become a store of value.

This was my understanding as well and is more consistent with Schiff's views on money. The properties Schiff doesn't understand about Bitcoin is its network effect and the huge amount of computing hashing power which can't easily be duplicated by an alt-currency. I've listened to Schiff for years; he's not very tech savvy although that is still no excuse for not grasping the subjective theory of value.

—the first of its kind for state money transmission law—and a requirement that duplicates the
efforts of FinCEN.  Additionally, the BitLicense’s state-level SARs requirement has no lower
bound of application (i.e., any transaction regardless of the dollar amount must be reported if
suspicious; this contrasts  with FinCEN, which generally requires reporting of suspicious
transactions only when they are over $2,000), potentially resulting in a flood of low-value
reports that hemorrhage sensitive user-credentials and damage user privacy because of
overly-cautious regulatory compliance. The license has a reporting requirement for all
transaction over $10,000  that similarly doubles the efforts of FinCEN.  In drafting the
BitLicense, New York’s Department of Financial Services has not explained why FinCEN and
Federal regulators are failing at their remit and therefore need a second line of state-level
reinforcements. Nowhere in New York’s, or for that matter, any state’s money transmission
licensing scheme, are such AML requirements in evidence.

While it is unlikely that any system can holistically be secured there have been no hacks of the Bitcoin protocol itself. So, while a hack of the system has happened, such as Mt. Gox, this hack is distinctly different from a hack of the underlying Bitcoin protocol. 


I never said that. I said if someone tries to steal gold it validates (ie. confirms) that gold is valuable.

I just looked at that website now. I'm not sure if I got the full sense of the user interface though. I like Spotify's UI. I can make my own playlists or I can use apps like Filtr to discover new music. 
I think something like Spotify with the ability to pay artists on a per song basis with BTC (ie. I pay each time I listen to the song) would work. Of course, there would also be the option of buying the songs or albums outright for unlimited listening. Prices would be set by the artists and Spotify would charge the artists like Bandcamp does.

Paper wallets are good for storing bitcoins but not for spending them because they don't have a 'change address' and therefore the full amount in a paper wallet must always be used.  If for example you have a paper wallet with 2 BTC on it and want to buy an item priced at 0.5 BTC you will end up losing 1.5 BTC in change!
If you want access to the funds in a paper wallet all of the coins in that wallet should be sent to another non-paper wallet that you control.

One can make the argument that price can also drive adoption.

I think this is an often underestimated feature of Bitcoin; the alignment of incentives to protect the value of bitcoins being paramount to the functioning of the system. There is currently so much value that even a slight change in the protocol such as the blocksize cap is being seen as risky. This is a stabilizing feature as it instills confidence and predictability in the future of Bitcoin even if the protocol isn't as efficient as it could be (if for example the blocksize cap were raised or removed entirely). Predictable expectations and risk minimization trump efficiency. So while the protocol can be changed, it can only do so if nearly all participating parties actively want that change; **consensus stems from necessity not from convincing.** I suspect that eventually the blocksize limit will be raised or eliminated but not until Bitcoin is free from the risk of entities that want to see it destroyed.

**Interest Flows versus Money Stocks**
Although it's true that if everyone tried to pay back his or her debts at the same time, the world would "run out of dollars," in general I think this critique overlooks an important distinction. When people owe interest, this is a flow concept that accrues over a period of time. In contrast, the total "money supply" is a stock concept that applies at a specific moment.
To see how this relates to our current discussion, let's consider a much simpler example. Suppose there are two neighbors living in a community that uses actual gold coins as its money. Mr. Smith starts out with 1,000 gold coins, while his neighbor Mr. Brown starts out with none.
Brown asks Smith if he can borrow 100 gold coins for a month. Smith agrees, but insists on a 12.7 percent APR, which works out to 1 percent interest charged monthly. So on day one of this deal, Smith has 900 gold coins while Brown has 100.
At the end of the month, after whatever buying and selling he has done with the rest of the community, Brown has accumulated 100 gold coins in his possession. He pays that back to Smith. Ah, but Brown is still short 1 gold coin. So he offers to cut Smith's lawn and paint his fence (with materials provided by Smith). In return for this labor, Smith pays Brown 1 gold coin, which Brown then uses to pay off his interest.
In the following month, Brown repeats the process: He borrows 100 gold coins up front, pays them back at the end of the month, and performs 1 gold coin worth of labor to earn the money to pay off the interest. Eventually, Brown and Smith simplify things. They constantly roll over the 100 gold coins of principal, and Brown performs a day's worth of chores once a month for Smith as the "servicing charges" on the loan.
As this simple example illustrates, a fixed stock of money can "turn over" several times a given calendar period, and thus provide the means with which to pay back a higher volume of loans. Even in a community with a fixed stock of money — picture people using gold where no new gold is being mined — the capitalists can charge positive interest rates, without necessarily forcing anyone to default.

I suspect that in the long run we will have many currencies including bitcoins in which the vast majority of BTC transactions take place off-chain. Even removing the blocksize cap altogether would not allow everyone to transact on-chain. Again, I don't see this as an elite vs. a commoner dichotomy. As long as we have a settlement layer which can't be controlled by a select group of people we will have a much more fair monetary system and level playing field compared to what we have today.

It seems to me that scaling on-chain necessarily leads to more centralization thru increased resources needed to run a full node. Off-chain scaling with LN does not have this tradeoff. Of course it is not entirely clear how many nodes are needed to ensure that BTC is resilient to attack by nefarious actors who would like to see it destroyed. The question then becomes; does this potential centralization risk of on-chain scaling outweigh the benefits of off-chain scaling? I just don't see significant benefits of on-chain scaling at this particular time in BTC's evolution but can see a role for it in the future.

**Warning: Tinfoil Hat Analysis**
On the one hand Bitcoin poses an existential threat to the current fiat currency regime and the government welfare/warfare state that it enables. A large outflow of savings out of the bond market and into bitcoins would cause global interest rates to rise leading to the inability of governments to fund themselves through bond sales and would therefore require additional monetary inflation. This would create a feedback loop where the inflation leads to higher interest rates and subsequently endless money printing ending in hyperinflation. I believe Ludwig von Mises called it a 'crack-up-boom.' With this scenario in mind it seems crazy that the government would ever allow the approval of the ETF.  
On the other hand, the government, mainly the Treasury Dept and Federal Reserve, realize that they are cornered. There is no end to the amount debt the country has, and little appetite politically to reduce government expenditures. The debt is unpayable. Every system is perfectly designed to get the results that it gets and this debt bomb is the only possible outcome of the fiat monetary system we have. The outcome was in fact predestined the moment that Nixon removed all gold backing of the USD in 1971. The Powers That Be (insert spooky music here) understand this.  
Knowing this scenario, the government is preparing for the big reset and a return to a monetary system backed by finite commodities such as gold, which they may or may not have, and cryptocurrencies which they may or may not have developed. In order to recapitalize the country and the banking sector and limit social unrest it is in the government's and country's best interest to insure that their citizens have as many bitcoins as possible. A bitcoin ETF approval would be a great way to bring as many bitcoins as possible stateside and under partial government control.

Whether or not something started off its existence in the settlement or payment camp is immaterial. What's more important is that the medium started off as being something of value. Gold became valuable as money because of its unique inherent properties (scarcity, divisibility, durability etc.) many of which bitcoins share. Bitcoin is currently in the process of being valued by the free market (aka price discovery).  As the author mentions, US dollars gained acceptance as a payment system because they were gold certificates fully redeemable for the precious metal. There was no US dollar payment system per se; US dollars at that time were essentially a gold payment system so long as they were believed to be convertible. Today, with that 'golden value anchor' broken, the fiat dollar continues to function as a settlement system which is an unsustainable situation and a key problem Bitcoin was meant to fix. Bitcoin has succeeded and will continue to do so because it's valuable and not because of its potential as a payment system (despite what the CEO of a Bitcoin payment system company would have you believe).  ;)

This is an assumption. Fee revenue may go up with larger blocks, it may go down, or it may remain unchanged. No one really can know for certain.

My main concern would be if there was significant decrease in the node count attributed to an increase in blocksize there would be a corrective mechanism to reverse course and preserve Bitcoin's resiliency against malicious actors.
Also, I suspect that no block size limit is, from a purely free market economics point of view, correct but politically unlikely at this point in time. People seem to view Bitcoin as working 'good enough'. Perhaps down the road when a greater proportion of the global economy's monetary foundation rests on Bitcoin it will be non-contentious to remove the limit. I think the BU guys may have a solution to a long term problem but the appetite for implementation now is too early.

There is concern among many investors that the gold price is artificially suppressed by the paper markets with multiple claims on the same physical bars of gold. Whether any of this speculation about gold manipulation is accurate is beyond my pay grade but it does seem plausible. Bitcoin is far more easy to take delivery of and audit/check proof of reserves. It seems possible that it would be more difficult to manipulate the bitcoin price than the gold price but I'm not certain.  
I agree that the SEC considers protecting investors as their mandate but I also believe that they would also take orders from people higher up in the government food chain if their actions posed a destabilizing to the current fiat system.  
The current bitcoin market is inconsequential but continued exponential growth in the price and number of people invested in Bitcoin would pose a threat sooner than many realize. Traditional stock or bond market corrections could also speed up the process.  
Governments have no problem affording their payments as they can always print the money to pay off the interest. What governments can't guarantee is confidence in their currency and retention of its purchasing power. The bonds are highly rated because they can be paid off in nominal terms but not in real terms. 
I'm not sure how the Fed can increase rates significantly with 20$ trillion in debt unless they cut entitlement and military spending in a significant way. There seems to be no political will to cut spending on either side of the aisle.

Yes there are other forces reflected in the 'orphan rate'. An 'orphan block' is a block found by a miner but ends up not being in the chain and therefore no reward is given.  The larger the blocks the longer it takes to send the block through the network. In that additional time there is risk that another miner will find a block, grab the reward, and orphan your block.

Certainly there must be some risk though. Isn't a miner who tries to mine a 1GB block much less likely to have that incorporated into the chain than a miner producing an empty block?
  
Also if miners start producing blocks that are too big this will lead to less nodes, loss of confidence in overall network security and will be reflected in a falling BTC price. Miners will have to titrate the blocksize accordingly as they are profit driven.

Miners would determine the blocksize but not the limit. We could occasionally have some really large blocks but on the whole miner behavior and median blocksize would likely best be determined by reactions to the bitcoin price. If the blocks were too small transaction fees would be too high and the BTC price would fall and if blocks were too large we'd see a drop in node counts with fears of centralization and a fall in the BTC price again. Somewhere in between is the blocksize 'sweet- spot'.

by Paul Vigna:  
For a crowd of uber-distrustful cryptoanarchists, bitcoiners are still a pretty optimistic lot. How else to describe the price action over the weekend for the digital currency, which ostensibly suffered a sharp setback after the Securities and Exchange Commission denied an application from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to build and sell a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund?
The price of bitcoin on Friday plunged after the SEC order came out. After trading as high as $1,325 during the morning, it fell as low as $1,022 in the immediate aftermath of the order. On Monday, though, bitcoin traded as high as $1,247, according to CoinDesk. On Tuesday, the price was in the same range, trading at $1,242. Volumes were especially high on Friday, but have since returned roughly to the ranges the market was seeing previously.
That’s not so surprising, really. Most bitcoin traders are also bitcoin backers. Some in the market were arguing that traders should buy on an SEC denial, even before the denial was issued. “If it [bitcoin] does correct Friday,” said Reggie Middleton, a bitcoin entrepreneur and investor, last Wednesday, “I think it’s a buying opportunity, because people are overreacting.”
The SEC decision was less about the Winklevoss twins’ specific proposal, than it was about the nature of bitcoin exchanges around the world. The SEC staff that wrote the decision did not take an explicit position on bitcoin itself, but instead focused on the issue of regulation of the exchanges that trade it. The vast majority are unregulated, and the SEC said that lack of transparency into bitcoin’s market was the reason for the denial.
That could make it hard for the other two firms, SolidX Management and Grayscale Investments, that have also proposed publicly regulated and traded ETFs. Neither has publicly commented on the SEC ruling. The Solidx proposal has a deadline of March 30. Grayscale’s isn’t until September.
To an extent, the SEC decision is a blow to the budding use case of bitcoin as a store of value, but it may have saved the currency from experiencing another wild swing. Had the SEC given the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust an approval, it almost certainly would have seen new money coming into the asset.
Back in January, Needham analyst Spencer Bogart had estimated an ETF could attract as much as $300 million in its first week. That kind of influx, given the pre-programmed limits on bitcoin creation, would have resulted in some severe pricing pressure on a fixed asset. “Opening up this much potential access to bitcoin this fast could have created a significant bubble,” said Hossein Kazemi, senior adviser at the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association.
However, even without new money coming in, bitcoin and its ilk are seeing rising demand. In addition to bitcoin’s rising price, myriad so-called alt-coins are also seeing money pour into them. The result is that the collective market cap for the entire landscape of digital currencies–including bitcoin alternatives like ether, dash and namecoin–rose by a more than $4 billion over the weekend, according to CoinDesk. That led bitcoin entrepreneur Vinny Lingham to warn on Twitter that “a lot of unsuspecting noobs are pumping fiat into alt coin…classic pump and dump schemes.”

Law enforcement and regulators best take a measured approach in tackling the potential increase in the use of virtual currencies to finance terrorist activities, as there is still scant evidence the nascent technology will become a preferred method of cash transfer and other means of funding remain readily available and hard to track, said a U.K. intelligence think-tank.  
Virtual currencies–a type of digital money that bears an encrypted computer code that can be transferred between internet users across borders without the need for a regulated financial institution–have an obvious appeal for those wanting to make illicit transactions, but so far there has been only one specific incident reported of its use by terrorists, said David Carlisle, an independent consultant writing for the Royal United Services Institute, an international defense and security think-tank in London. The Indonesian government disclosed in early January that it had detected instances of virtual currency transfers from a known terrorist to fund Daesh–also known as Islamic State–triggering alarm bells in the anti-terrorism finance community. But security enforcers need to keep “perspective,” wrote Mr. Carlisle, who previously worked at the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “Treating cryptocurrencies as an exceptional threat creates the misleading impression that more conventional financial products are not already equally, or more, vulnerable to terrorist exploitation.”  
Citing a recent research paper by RUSI, Mr. Carlisle noted that small cells and lone wolf actors need fairly small amounts of money to fund their activities, and they already have “a number of reliable financing streams” that are hard to trace, such as student and payday loans, welfare benefits and cash.  “With such simple funding available, terrorists may not need to rush into cryptocurrencies,” he said. What’s more, the Indonesian case reveals that law enforcement can break the secrecy of such transactions, especially of those using blockchain, the most commonly used ledger of virtual currency transactions. Given the benefits that the technology offers to people who don’t have access to bank accounts, regulators should tread carefully to “harness the promise of technological innovation while also managing financial crime risks that are still only taking shape,” said Mr. Carlisle.

If only one user dumped 10 billion dollars into Bitcoin today the price would skyrocket. If the number of users doubled tomorrow but they only used Bitcoin to each save 1$ it would have much less of an effect on the price. More users does not guarantee a higher value of Bitcoin and comes with potential costs of centralization if the node count decreases with bigger blocks.

I agree with AA (as do the BU supporters) that big blocks can't satisfy the demand for all BTC transactions but the 'right size' of the blocks can only be determined by prices discovered by the free market. We wouldn't see GB sized blocks even if the cap was removed as it would be detrimental to the miners to do so. They would lose revenue to miners creating smaller blocks by having too many blocks orphaned and their bitcoins would lose value as people lost confidence in the network with dropping node counts and centralization.  
I'm not sure if it is absolutely necessary to pay node operators directly. They may be incentivized and indirectly compensated to run nodes in order to maintain the purchasing power of their bitcoin holdings. I have seen several commenters discuss the possibility of miners paying node operators but I'm not sure how close to reality it is.

A few years ago many were worried about one of the miners approaching 51% of the hash rate? Ultimately, the system **self regulated**.

The same balance of fear and greed exist today and I'm confident the miners would take action to allay any worries of centralization. All of our incentives are aligned to maximize the value of Bitcoin.

Andreas is excellent but not infallible. One should immediately question Andreas' theory based on the fact that countless blocks have not been filled to capacity. There is a physical resource limit to how large blocks can be even if there were no artificial block size limit. If you want to understand the economics of Bitcoin I suggest reading writers like Justus Ranvier, Mengerian, and Daniel Krawisz at the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. They have an excellent understanding of free market economics (Austrian school type stuff) and the incentives which drive miners and users.

The problem with the gold standard is that there is a fixed price of gold denominated in fiat. It is ridiculous to arbitrarily claim that 35$ can be converted into 1 ounce of gold after the government inflated the money supply. This price fixing leads to gold shortages and runs on gold (ie. when France called in their gold from the US). What is really needed is a free floating market determined price of gold. With a market discovered price for real physical gold (not the paper derivatives markets we have now) there would be no shortages. Of course the price of an ounce of gold would far exceed the current 1200$ levels and expose the true levels of monetary inflation but there would be no gold shortages. If you watch to the Khan video one realizes that he misses this point entirely when he claims that the economy wouldn't function because we don't have enough gold. We do have enough gold, the problem is is that it is completely mispriced.

Miners need users and users need miners. It is a symbiotic relationship where both parties' interests are aligned. In addition, neither miners nor users are a monolithic group.

Ultimately the SEC failed in their mission to protect investors. Of course, in reality the SEC can't succeed because their incentive structure is perverted and there are no competitive agencies. In a private market there would be competitors providing these protective financial services who would be incentivized to closely scrutinize the Markopolos information. Corroborating the information would improve their reputation and attract future customers, rejecting Markopolos' information would have the opposite result or even their demise. All competing agencies would likely issue timely reports detailing their analysis of the leaks. At the very least the barriers and fear that Markopolos faced in initially getting his findings to the SEC wouldn't exist. Investors would have been aware of a potential problem years in advance and would have taken it upon themselves to do more research.  
No such accountability exists for the SEC monopoly. The ultimate effects are a skittish bureaucratic agency whose own interests are put before the public's. An agency who have less of an appetite to approve any product that is even slightly new or innovative all in the name of 'consumer protection'.

I agree we won't go back on a gold standard which has historically proven to be unsustainable when gov'ts are pressed for revenue. My word choice was definitely misleading. I follow a blog by a guy "named" FOFOA who writes a lot about what he calls "freegold" where the price of gold floats against the world currencies as opposed to being fixed to them at a standard exchange rate (ie. price fixing). This floating exchange rate would be much higher than the current price and would represent physical gold's true price as opposed to its current price which is set in the paper markets. My understanding is that once this happens gold will return to its role as a store of value and replace current instruments like government bonds. I see Bitcoin playing a similar role but can also envision a world where Bitcoin off-chain transactions serve as a medium of exchange along side the dollar in the short to medium term but gradually replacing it in the long term. I can't imagine on-chain transactions being used to buy a coffee at Starbucks based on my relatively limited technology knowledge.

The driver doesn't even have to make a stop though. He will get paid if he just keeps on driving. In fact, the faster he drives and the less he stops the more money he will earn; that is unless the passengers make it worth his time to stop. The driver must then weigh the benefits of the added passenger fees offset by the time wasted in picking them up. If the passengers don't offer enough he'll just pass them by.  
Of course this will piss the passengers off.  The driver doesn't want that either as he will lose his business. He will have to find a balance between his own needs and his customers. It may be that the equilibrium point requires a bigger bus so that he can accommodate more passengers.  
Unfortunately, there is currently a regulation that states that his bus can only be a certain size due to the risk of too large a bus being targeted and destroyed by a rogue group of crazy cab drivers who feel like he's a threat to their business.
  
Some people dislike this bus size rule. They believe that the buses should be made as big as possible so that all rides can be free!  
Other people claim that the bus driver isn't an idiot and doesn't need anyone to tell him how big or small his bus should be. He's smart enough to figure out the size bus he needs. If the bus is too big passengers won't want to ride in it as it will be risky, too big a target for cabs, and they might get injured or die in an accident. The bus driver also understands that if his bus is too big a target his customers might switch to another bus company or worse yet, if all the bus companies disappear, take rides with the crazy kamikaze cabbies!

Bitcoin is not an easy sell to the general public. You seem to have stumbled upon Bitcoin exactly as I did after the 2008 financial crisis. Learning about the monetary system along with all of the jargon is a relatively long arduous task which is boring to many and also requires setting aside and challenging one's preconceived notions about what money is and government's role in society. Most people don't want to exert the effort or devote the time to learning about something that they currently perceive as a potential solution to a non-existent problem. I believe this perception will change and people will come to appreciate Bitcoin as the global economy deteriorates; it will probably happen as a natural process rather than an active one pushed by a handful of vocal cryptocurrency advocates driving adoption. I am also a vocal advocate- but not too vocal; I'll plant the seeds of Bitcoin in their minds and hopefully they'll germinate when the time comes. People in your part of the world may be more receptive though. Good luck. :)

I believe Satoshi placed the blocksize limit to prevent DDOS attacks. Is this attack vector no longer a threat if the limit was raised or even removed altogether? Does raising or removing the limit open Bitcoin up to other potential types of attacks that it does not currently face? Does raising the limit in the face of significant yet not overwhelming consensus create a dangerous precedent whereby Bitcoin may be perceived as being less than immutable?
While the economic arguments for removing or raising the blocksize limit may be sound, these economic arguments may not be enough to trump the appeal of an immutable protocol. A protocol which starts down the road of making changes in the absence of near unanimous consensus or in the absence of existential threats may be perceived by savers/investors as being a protocol not worthy of storing ones wealth for the long term. I suspect that most if not all of the positive externalities that Roger lists can be achieved with Bitcoin acting as a settlement/store of value layer and the Lightning Network or some other secondary layer acting as the currency/payments layer.
So, while the current limit may not be perfect it may be good enough for the short to intermediate term. Perhaps the limit could be more safely eliminated altogether in the long term when more of the world have come to appreciate Bitcoin's benefits and are dependent upon it and when governments pose less of a threat. It could also be instructive to see what happens to the ETH exchange rate should Ethereum decide to hard fork their protocol as they deal with the DAO issue.

BU isn't hostile as it is a voluntary opt-in process. BU simply allows node operators to voluntarily select what blocksize they are willing to accept. This signal allows miners to monitor what the nodes are capable of handling and whether or not it is safe and in their economic best interests to produce larger blocks. If all core supporters ran BU nodes they could signal that they are only willing to accept 1MB blocks (in fact even by running Core itself that signal is being sent). I'm still not fully sold on BU as I haven't read up on possible attacks especially by nefarious actors but to call it 'hostile' is not accurate IMHO.

Here's how I believe it may play out:
The sovereign debt market is huge and represents a large store of value for investors globally. As interest rates on these debt obligations become more and more negative there should be a shift into alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Given BTC's tiny 'market cap' relative to the bond market's, any small shift of value from bonds to BTC will cause large increases in the price of bitcoin which would attract more investor attention. I expect the pattern of bubbles and busts similar to what we've seen in the past several years to continue with ever increasing bitcoin prices and less interest in storing value in bonds. Without these bonds as a source of funds, governments will have to resort to either paring their spending or increasing taxes. When citizens are taxed excessively for wasteful government spending there will be a shift in the public's perceived role for and importance of these large national bureaucracies.

In the past people used convenient gold and silver bank issued paper certificates to substitute for the real metal coins. People trusted the system until governments absconded with the underlying physical gold settlement layer. Why would an off-chain layer not be trusted especially given that digital bitcoins are far more easily audited/transparent compared to their physical gold counterparts making such past confiscation shenanigans far less likely? In a similar vein, I am reminded of the story of the large Rai stone money which had sunk to the bottom of the ocean yet the community was still able to ascribe possession to its rightful owner. Finally, my understanding is that Bitcoin cannot scale anywhere near the volumes necessary to accommodate daily global payments without sacrificing significant amounts of decentralization. How much can we hope to gain via on-chain scaling? If I recall correctly, Nick Szabo, who is far more knowledgeable than myself, has also said that he envisions BTC as a settlement layer. While I agree with the economic soundness of removing the blocksize limit entirely I just can't see that happening given the **perceived** risks and the possibilities of off-chain scaling.  
Where do you think I'm going wrong with my analysis? Thanks.

The purchasing power of gold would be less compared to what it would have been if the additional asteroid gold wasn't mined.

The government would then have to institute some type of capital controls and even ban cash which some financial 'experts' have already talked about.

IMHO while the premium may disappear the price of GBTC could still rise if the underlying bitcoin price spiked due to the increased interest generated by the COIN ETF.

anonymity, an option could be to extend the restrictions to cash payments to all payments ensuring anonymity
(cryptocurrencies, payment in kinds, etc.). On the other hand, restrictions on cash payments could promote the
development of alternative payments technologies compatible with the non-anonymity objective pursued.  
  


While being allowed to pay in cash does not constitute a fundamental right, the objective of the initiative, which is
to prevent the anonymity that cash payments allow, might be viewed as an infringement of the right to privacy
enshrined in Article 7 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, as complemented by article 52 of the
Charter, **limitations may be made subject to the principle of proportionality if they are necessary and genuinely
meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of
others.** The objectives of potential restrictions to cash payments could fit such description. It should also be
observed that national restrictions to cash payments were never successfully challenged based on an
infringement to fundamental rights.

Great first post and welcome to reddit!
I agree with your analysis. The current fiat monetary system is in shambles and is undergoing a slow motion train wreck (although some days it falters faster than others). Bitcoin is a huge opportunity to preserve and accumulate wealth as long as one is patient - as measured in years. A scarce digital money is something the world has never seen before. Volatility is to be expected in such a nascent market but patience will be rewarded.  
I believe Bitcoin's future will look much like the past in terms of successive bubbles and bursts with an ever increasing price over the long term and layers of additional human capital being added along the way. As I mentioned in another post, basic banking services offered by companies like Circle and Coinbase will offer laypeople convenient on ramps into Bitcoin without having to worry about key management. In terms of what Bitcoin needs to rocket I'd love to see some improvements in privacy/fungibility.

So I assume LN acts as the equivalent of my current bank checking account while my on-chain btc are more of an old school savings account/safe deposit box.
I also assume that most of the world will not be able to have an on-chain btc account and will use LN connected 'banks'. Perhaps, many of the current redditors will pool their btcs and form these 'btc banks'.  
Can individuals without btc be given access to the LN to control their own btc- denominated accounts?

The Clintons have earned over 100 million dollars over the past 15 years according to Forbes magazine. The source of the income are 'speaking fees' and 'consulting fees'. While the income is explained I personally find the 'wealth' unexplained. What prevents me from claiming that I earned my wealth from a handful of consulting gigs? How is the fair market value determined? Can the Clintons claim that 15 years worth of speaking fees and consulting fees merits 100 million dollars worth of wealth? If it does merit that much for the Clintons shouldn't I too be able to claim the same? If not, why not? Is it because I don't have as much 'political capital' to peddle?
tl;dr The rules only apply to us plebs. Also, we probably need better fungibility ASAP.

Imagine these guys who were sitting on gains of 10x then sold only to see the prices double again. I mean if you bought at 20$ and then the price went up to 200$ how could you not sell? Yet, here we are at over 500$. It's lunacy to claim that it takes no effort to hold. Also, I think it's why so many of the stories of early bitcoiners who made the most money are those people who lost or forgot about their wallets and then found them.

I think the easiest and safest thing for GBTC to do is hold their pre-fork BTCs and never split or cash them in. Who knows what the future holds in terms of the number of forks we have. I don't want the GBTC team to play a guessing game as to which fork they believe will be successful and long lasting. I think if they sell their BCH they set a dangerous precedent and GBTC turns from a straightforward way to hold BTCs into a speculative investment vehicle dependent on fund managers.

You have a pin code that protects the Trezor. Every incorrect PIN entry causes an increasing amount of time before the next PIN entry can be made. In addition to the PIN the Trezor has a password which can be enabled for further protection. Finally, when you set up a Trezor wallet you are given a 'seed' which is a list of 24 words. These words should be written down and kept somewhere safe. A new Trezor can then be ordered and the 24 words and passwords entered into the new device 'magically' giving you access to your coins again! Remember the coins aren't actually stored on the Trezor; the coins are present on the blockchain. The actual access to the coins comes from the private keys generated from the password and 24 word 'seed'. In fact, you can enter that seed and password into other wallets like Electrum and get access to your bitcoin wallet without even having a Trezor.

Sounds good. However, I don't think that there should be a distinction between merchants and consumers/holdlers; both are individuals who for the most part have the same desire of increasing their well being in life. We should therefore expect their attitudes towards BTC to be similar.  
Many bitcoiners want to encourage BTC acceptance by merchants. These BTC advocates want to 'push' bitcoins onto merchants. It won't work. Merchant adoption has to occur by merchants 'pulling' bitcoins into their ecosystem; by merchants themselves wanting bitcoins after realizing that bitcoins have more value than fiat. Essentially, merchants will adopt bitcoin when they too want to become hodlers and not on anyone else's schedule.  
Bitcoin is a collectible whose value comes from demand attributed to its underlying properties useful as a money. As more people come to realize the importance of these qualities, adoption will increase and will in turn be reflected in a higher bitcoin price.

Whatever. It's semantics - attack vs. not attack. The broader picture is that the new cryptocoin is a competitor which in and of itself threatens the original cryptocoin but must prove its value to investors. That's what's supposed to happen. This is an evolutionary process where market participants as individuals are using their money to decide which crypto best fulfills their needs and vision as to what represents the best form of money. There is no way to avoid this competition. No one owes you, me, Bitcoin or any other crypto a 'safe space'. If you don't know which is best just hodl.

This is how Bitcoin is supposed to work. He is acting rationally. If miners revenue will be throttled by small blocks they will move to where the money is.

You can call them whatever you want. The important point is that real decisions have to be made with regards to selling or hodling them. I'm not smart enough to know for certain what will happen so my strategy is to hodl.

I have a hard time calling it an attack on Bitcoin especially given that all BTC private key holders were BCH private key holders at the time of the fork. At that point they had the decision to either hold or sell their BCH. This was a wholly voluntary decision. 
An attack would be a government maliciously destroying Bitcoin and all its value and forcing all holders to use their fiat currency.
Bitcoin Cash supporters simply have a different opinion as how to make Bitcoin better. Attackers on the other hand want to see Bitcoin die.

Is 34K of BTC margin longs a lot? Can you explain in simple terms to a non-trader what the implications of a falling BTC price is on someone with a margin long position?  


I don't quite understand this statement. Can you ELI5?
Looking at the charts from the link that you posted it seems like the number of longs is slowly building up since the BFX hack but nowhere near the historical highs of around 75K. Interestingly, the ratio of margin longs to shorts seems much higher post BFX hack compared to before the hack. I don't know enough about trading to explain this change in the ratio. Maybe it does support the notion that sentiment is too bullish.

If you don't control the private keys then it's not an open public blockchain.  
  
If the network hash rate is not significantly high enough or distributed enough then the private keys that you control will not have value as the immutability of the ledger can be compromised.

If you don't think there is a difference between backing your currency with BTC vs. fiat how would you explain Nixon's action of closing the gold window in 1971? There may be no hard limit to the amount of debt that can be taken out with either gold/BTC backing vs. pure fiat but the inflation of the money supply is discovered sooner under the former system compared to the latter. This helps prevent systemic monetary failure and allows citizens to protect their wealth by exchanging their paper notes for gold or bitcoins before it's too late.

You started off the thread by saying that people (you use the derogatory term 'fools') should sell their bitcoins because 10K$ price predictions made in 2014 were wrong. This comment stems from your misunderstanding of money and your membership in the 'cult of fiat'.  You accuse me of cult indoctrination without realizing (how could you, you're in so deep) that it is in fact yourself who is blinded. Also, if you think hodling is the same thing as sitting on your ass you've never hodled. The easiest thing in the world to do is sell after a big gain, and many 'fools' do. It takes a deeper understanding of money to be able to hodl over the very long run until people like yourself wake-up and realize that bitcoins are orders of magnitude more valuable than any 'government guaranteed' paper currency.

Well that all depends when you bought the GBTC. People who bought 12 months ago are up pretty big.

Nonetheless, I expect that if the COIN ETF were to be approved next week we'd see a huge rise in the price of BTC and similarly GBTC. I could be wrong though as some people, such as have concerns that GBTC is materially different than the COIN ETF.

I think it's important to remember that we can't dictate what the transaction fees are. Even if the blocksize limit were removed entirely it's possible that the market would select fees that are higher than those we have today. Bitcoin is both a transfer network and a monetary asset and their values are co-dependent. Some people put a premium on the transfer network while others on the monetary asset. This causes messy disagreements in our community in the short term but in the long term I'm confident that Bitcoin will flourish and meet the needs of both groups.

So just to review: I'd make a list of some of my public addresses, wipe the Trezor, then restore the Trezor offline and generate some addresses after restore. If the restore addresses are the same as the ones I had before I wiped I'd be good.
Can this be done using Electrum installed on an offline computer? Thanks.
Edit: Also, just to be clear I don't mind checking my balance online after my seed has been restored offline. I simply want to restore my seed on a machine that has never been connected to the internet so as to avoid keyloggers.

Both MOE and SOV attributes can evolve simultaneously with the MOE attribute taking precedence during some time periods and the SOV attribute taking precedence during other time periods. The proportion of each attribute can likely be reflected in the BTC exchange rate with price rises correlating to SOV being favored while price declines correlating to MOE being favored. To believe that we must temporally move in a linear manner from a MOE to SOV seems an oversimplification and narrow minded.

No, Ponzi schemes that *misrepresent* themselves as something else are fraudulent. Representation is the key. If someone starts a Ponzi scheme and clearly explains and documents how it 'works' and people invest their money willingly then there isn't any fraud. If on the other hand a Ponzi scheme misrepresents itself to investors, those investors have the right to sue the Ponzi operator for compensation. Bitcoin is simply a technology (without an operator) in which bitcoin units may be purchased. The value of those units may rise or fall. No performance guarantees are made as there is no one to make them. I don't believe anyone has the moral authority to dictate to others how they should or shouldn't invest their money.

Right now it's a speculative asset that many are betting will become useful as money given its inherent characteristics. Bitcoin is highly divisible, portable, durable, and is in limited supply. These are the same attributes that made gold a good form of money for thousands of years. Over time many of us believe that Bitcoin's price will stabilize at a level much higher than it is today. When it does stabilize, Bitcoin will be much more useful as a currency and unit of account. Over the past 7  years Bitcoin has been more successful than many people could have dreamed, but it still has a ways to go.

Which scenario has more demand?:  
 1. 10 million users transferring 1 bitcoin/day  
 2. 1 user transferring 10 million bitcoins/day  
In scenario 2, are consumers being driven back to fiat? What if scenario 2 is a central bank using BTC as a settlement layer for their currency which is backed by BTC?  
I believe that BTC can radically change the world even if most people are using it indirectly as a currency which is settled on-chain. Historically we have a precedent for this. Gold limited the size of government by functioning as a non-inflationary, finite supply, settlement layer. Unfortunately, gold was able to be co-opted by governments due to its physical nature. I'm not sure this type of confiscation would be possible with a distributed electronic commodity like BTC.

The last time the Fed raised rates it coincided with a fall in the stock market and an increase in the price of gold. Remember that interest rates can be high because the debt is perceived as risky. Bond yields have soared in recent years in European countries under financial stress and at high risk of default until the ECB came to the rescue. The US can't afford to pay their debts either which is one of the reasons why the Fed has kept rates so low for so long. If rates continue to rise the Fed will have to counter with more QE to service that debt which would lead to debasement of the very currency in which the bonds are valued. What good is a higher yield when the purchasing power of the dollar is falling? Rates are rising because of these higher inflation expectations and therefore I'd expect the price of gold to eventually rise despite short term price movements in the opposite direction.

The COIN ETF is a derivative of bitcoin, isn't it? If it works like the GLD ETF most individual investors won't be able to take actual delivery of the underlying asset. In GLD for example the minimum withdrawal required to take delivery of actual bullion is about 10 million dollars worth (100 000 shares). So while, GLD may trade at a smaller premium or even a discount, at the end of the day the main issue is physical possession. In a SHTF scenario, and when you need it most, there will be no physical gold or actual BTC settlement. Most owners of GLD, COIN, and GBTC will be cash settled with only the big institutional players getting any of the underlying assets.

I used to think this too a few years ago. Then the financial crisis of 2008 hit. I wondered what happened and why it happened. I did a lot of reading and watching and came to the conclusion that the crux of the problem was centralized/government control of the money supply. I believe both Bitcoin and gold are more honest forms of money. They compliment each other and share many traits which give them value. It's hard for me to imagine how one can be pro-Bitcoin but anti-gold. It's like someone who loves music but only listens to mp3s and refuses to listen to vinyl records.

You are limiting 'use' of Bitcoin to on-chain use only. I believe that usage also incorporates indirect use as well.
There will always be a tradeoff between centralization of the store of value through increases in blocksize vs. centralization of the medium of exchange via off-chain transactions.
I would rather sacrifice centralization of the medium of exchange as opposed to risking bitcoin debasement and centralization of the Bitcoin protocol itself.

Most nodes are not miners. Nodes simply are computers that have an up-to-date copy of the blockchain and relay transactions to each other, and make sure that the transactions they receive follow the Bitcoin protocol rules.

What percentage of global transactions do you think can happen on the Bitcoin blockchain if the block limit were removed while at the same time ensuring that network security is not compromised Remember all transactions- credit cards, debit cards, institutional and individual financial assets, cash transactions etc. The fact is that resources are limited and Bitcoin can currently only service a fraction of a percent of these transactions before compromising the underlying value of the bitcoins themselves. 
There will be a need for some other system. Some off-chain type solution where a token representing a certain number of satoshis is transferred much like paper notes used to circulate while the gold that it represented sat in a vault. With Bitcoin we have vaults which can more easily be audited and can have large settlement transactions between financial institutions which can occur effortlessly on-chain.

Ludwig von Mises talks about 'use value' and 'monetary value'.

It has practically all of the attributes which make for a perfect form of money such as divisibility, scarcity, durability, and portablity. I am a bit concerned about its lack of absolute anonymity (ie. fungibility) but hopefully this will improve over time. In sum, I see Bitcoin serving as the monetary foundation upon which a less corrupt more equitable society can be built by removing the creation and control of money from governments to individuals.

Nov. 3, 2017 7:00 a.m. ET  
In early October, CME Group Inc. Chief Executive and Chairman Terrence Duffy met with one of his top lieutenants and set in motion a risky plan that the exchange operator had been secretly developing for two years: launching a futures contract based on bitcoin.
That plan was unveiled this week, and represented a big step toward bringing the highly volatile digital currency into the financial mainstream. Bitcoin, which only started trading in 2009, has long been a niche market and continues to be tarnished by its association with illicit activity.
Thanks to Mr. Duffy, it now has the blessing of the $47.6 billion global exchange giant. If the Chicago-based firm can establish a viable bitcoin futures market, both Wall Street banks and retail investors would be more likely to trade the digital currency, many market participants say. CME plans to list bitcoin futures by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.
CME’s announcement is the clearest move yet that the financial industry is starting to warm up to bitcoin. It came just weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it was considering setting up a trading operation for digital currencies. CME’s smaller crosstown rival, Cboe Global Markets Inc., is also seeking to launch bitcoin futures, it said in August.
If digital-currency futures take off, Mr. Duffy would add another major accomplishment to his tenure at CME, though he risks harming the company’s reputation should the contract flop or generate controversy.
A former hog futures trader who got his start in the frenzy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s trading pits, he now oversees a sprawling exchange empire that runs a dizzying array of markets, from crude oil to gold to stock-market futures. As CME’s chairman since 2002, Mr. Duffy helped turn the firm into the world’s largest exchange operator, spearheading tie-ups with the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the New York Mercantile Exchange in 2008. He also handled the delicate task of persuading CME’s once-powerful floor traders to allow more electronic trading, drawing on his history in the pits to win support for the change.
Mr. Duffy took the CEO job a year ago, after his predecessor unexpectedly retired. Since then, CME’s share price is up nearly 20%. The move into bitcoin is by far the boldest step he has made as CEO.
“By nature I think he’s a pretty conservative guy, but he will move swiftly when he needs to,” said Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill + Partners.
CME was tight-lipped about its bitcoin plans before Tuesday’s announcement, and some media reports suggested it had gotten cold feet. But behind the scenes, the company had long been laying the groundwork for the launch.
In November 2016, after close to a year of work, CME started publishing a daily bitcoin price index that will be the basis of its new futures contract. More recently, CME has consulted with outside advisers, including major bitcoin investors, about how its contract would work, people familiar with the situation said. At a New York meeting in May, the group discussed how CME should handle a “fork”—a situation where a breakaway faction of programmers sets up an alternative version of bitcoin.
Mr. Duffy said he greenlighted the launch in October after repeatedly hearing from CME customers that they wanted bitcoin futures. He declined to say who lobbied him directly, but another CME executive said the firm heard from electronic-trading firms, hedge funds and exchange-traded-fund issuers, as well as banks whose own customers had been inquiring about bitcoin.
The 59-year-old CEO said he grew more comfortable with bitcoin after watching it survive repeated blows, such as a recent crackdown in China, a major hub for the digital currency.
“It’s a story that just doesn’t want to go away,” he said.
CME makes money by collecting fees when futures contracts are traded on its markets. That means it is neutral about the price of commodities, but its profits increase with heavier trading volume, which often goes hand-in-hand with spikes in volatility.
Creating a new market for bitcoin, which is notorious for wild price swings, could juice trading activity at CME, bringing in new fee income at a time when volatility across many of its markets has been muted. The digital currency has surged more than 600% this year, briefly hitting a record above $7,300 on Thursday.
But skeptics call the bitcoin phenomenon a bubble that will inevitably pop, with potential repercussions for CME.
“If the market takes a dive and a lot of mom-and-pops are hurt, they will blame the futures market, just like they have done a hundred times in history,” said Neal Wolkoff, former CEO of the American Stock Exchange.
Mr. Duffy knows the inherent risks in trading. As a young floor trader in 1981, he misheard a customer’s order and lost $150,000, nearly ending his trading career. He was bailed out by his mentor at the time, a veteran trader named Vincent Schreiber. Mr. Duffy spent three years paying him back, with money earned from trading by day and bartending by night.
Today, a portrait of the late Mr. Schreiber sits in Mr. Duffy’s office, amid framed photos of Hollywood stars and politicians whom the CME chief has befriended over the years, such as Hillary Clinton and John Boehner.
Mr. Duffy, a registered Republican who has donated to politicians of both parties, is a seasoned operator in Washington and has testified on Capitol Hill dozens of times. His knack for courting regulators could help move CME’s bitcoin plan forward and overcome the skepticism many officials hold toward the digital currency. CME needs signoff from its regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to launch its bitcoin contract.
Mr. Duffy concedes that his big gambit may fail.
“I’m not saying this is going to work,” he said. “But I do know there is pent-up demand for people to participate in it, and I’m going to offer it on a regulated platform.”

I think you need to revisit this thought and really think deeply about why you believe it.

Is it inconceivable that a bitcoin could be worth 25000$, 50000$, or even 1 million? It was just 10$ a little while ago yet here we are at over 7000$. Is it that much of a stretch to believe that Bitcoin can't continue this progression?  
The world has changed dramatically over the past half century and would be unrecognizable to generations past. The internet, smartphones, video and music streaming, solar energy, self driving cars; and this is likely just the beginning. People tend to underestimate the rate of technological progress.

One of Chicago’s largest high-speed traders has taken a central role in the bitcoin market, stepping into the vacuum created by Wall Street’s hesitant response to the booming investor interest in digital currencies.
DRW Holdings LLC uses quantitative models to buy and sell bitcoin, for its own account and for use as a market maker—firms that grease the wheels of finance by buying, selling and quoting prices. Cumberland, DRW’s digital-currency unit, says it has traded more than $20 billion worth of bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in the past year. That makes it one of the top market makers in the sector, traders said.
Bitcoin, invented less than a decade ago, is up more than 900% this year and recently surpassed $9,000 for the first time. It was trading at $9,338.20 late Sunday. The value of all the bitcoins in existence is about $157 billion, more than the market capitalization of Caterpillar Inc.
Despite those gains, the market for bitcoin is plagued by extreme volatility and an uncertain regulatory status, factors that have limited the interest of many Wall Street firms. DRW started its bitcoin desk more than three years ago, but banking giants such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. are just now considering how they will handle bitcoin trading.
“They were very early adopters, and they’ve got a massive lead over everyone else,” said Brian Kelly, founder of BKCM Digital Asset Fund, a crypto hedge fund that trades regularly with Cumberland.
Founded in 1992, DRW employs more than 800 people and trades on exchanges around the world. About a quarter of its business involves high-frequency trading—running automated strategies over ultrafast network connections—although other strategies can involve trades that last for months or even years.
Based in a sleek Chicago skyscraper, DRW’s offices feel more like those of a Silicon Valley tech company than a Wall Street bank, with a casual dress code and weekly visits from a meditation teacher.
As a nonbank firm that doesn’t manage money for outside investors, DRW is less subject to the regulatory questions looming over bitcoin than Goldman and other major banks.
Donald Wilson Jr., the firm’s founder and chief executive, has clashed with regulators over civil allegations that DRW manipulated an interest-rate contract in 2011. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued him and his company over the allegations, in a case that went to trial last year.
Mr. Wilson and DRW have rejected the allegations, saying their trading strategy was lawful and slamming the agency’s legal arguments as flawed. Unlike most traders facing a CFTC manipulation case, they refused to settle. The judge has yet to reveal his verdict.
DRW doesn’t report financial results, and it declined to say how much money its crypto unit makes. Mike Komaransky, a former partner who helped build Cumberland, retired from the company in June at age 38. He drew attention in August when he put his Florida mansion on sale for $6.5 million and offered to accept payment in bitcoin. The house is still on sale, Mr. Komaransky said.
DRW set up Cumberland in 2014, the same year a theft of more than $470 million worth of bitcoin from Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, and other troubles caused the digital currency to lose more than half its value.
Cumberland was among the biggest buyers of bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht, founder of the underground online drug bazaar Silk Road, who is now serving a life sentence after being convicted of narcotics trafficking, conspiracy to launder money and other crimes. The unit bought about 70,000 such bitcoins in auctions conducted by U.S. and overseas authorities, it says.
Mr. Wilson thinks bitcoin’s reputation as a tool for criminals is undeserved. “A lot of shady people have done a lot of bad things with dollars,” he said in an interview.
Initially, DRW considered focusing on bitcoin mining, a process in which computers solve complex math problems to generate new bitcoins. That led the firm to call its crypto unit Cumberland Mining &amp; Materials LLC—a name borrowed from the Grateful Dead song “Cumberland Blues,” about a hardworking miner.
Cumberland mines Zcash, an upstart digital currency whose backers say it has better privacy protections than bitcoin. Cumberland is tight-lipped about its mining operation, saying only that it is located in the U.S. near a low-cost source of hydroelectric power. Cheap electricity is essential for cryptocurrency mining to be profitable.
The unit also runs automated trading “bots” that try to eke out profits from differences between the prices of digital currencies on different exchanges.
But Cumberland’s fastest-growing business is market-making, especially in big-ticket trades of at least $100,000 and ranging into the millions of dollars. Its team of 15 in Chicago, London and Singapore receive inquiries around the clock from crypto funds, wealthy bitcoin investors and other clients seeking to buy or sell digital currencies.
Bobby Cho, head of over-the-counter trading at Cumberland, expects banks will eventually enter the market. “Bitcoin is a very polarizing word,“ he said. ”Regardless of whether you love it or hate it, if you have an opportunity to cross-sell it to your client, you want to take it.”
Mr. Wilson, who started his career in the CME’s eurodollar options pit in 1989, acknowledges that bitcoin is a risky business. Unlike many crypto enthusiasts, he says the jury’s still out on whether bitcoin will succeed.
“Even now, I look at it as an experimental thing,” Mr. Wilson said. “Who knows if it will become a viable currency?”

You are correct. It's not great for a currency...yet. Over time as the amount of money shifts from traditional currencies into bitcoins I expect the value of bitcoins to rise, volatility of bitcoin to decrease and utility as a currency and unit of account to improve. Until then, I expect significant volatility and a significant rise in price over the long term.

Fortunately, in the long run people will use the tools which benefit themselves the most despite what the entrenched parties think is 'best for us'.

You can have the best developers in the world but if they're working on a coin with inferior economic attributes then they're either going to fail or end up working on the coin with better economic principles.  
The block size limit is an artificial man made cap causing transaction fees to be higher than they would have otherwise been without a block size limit. This makes Bitcoin less useful as a currency and thereby decreases its overall value proposition.
Of course, there must be a certain amount of decentralization to ensure that Bitcoin maintains censorship resistance; but what the exact amount of decentralization needed is can not be decided by Core (or anyone else for that matter) but must be determined by the market participants. I believe that if blocks got too big and threatened censorship resistance the price would fall and act as a signal to miners to alter their behavior.
Cash promoters and supporters seem to understand these fundamental economic principles.
tl;dr  Don't write-off BCH as economics may trump network effects. Just hodl.

Relative to Bitcoin all of the world's currencies have been collapsing for the past 8 years.

Gold Bugs Embrace Bitcoin, Upending Retail Sellers  
 
By Stephanie Yang
Nov. 1, 2017 5:30 a.m. ET
Gold prices are rallying, but retail gold dealers and shops are struggling to survive.
Businesses that sell gold coins and other products made from the precious metal usually thrive during years like 2017. Gold futures have gained more than 10%, boosted by a weaker dollar and by big investors looking for a haven during recent geopolitical tensions surrounding North Korea and Iran.
Yet sales this year of American Eagles, a popular gold coin and a proxy for retail sales of physical gold, have fallen to their lowest levels since 2007, according to the U.S. Mint.
The weak demand is taking a toll on gold dealers, some of whose sales have dropped as much as 70% compared with last year, according to Jeffrey Christian, managing partner at market-research firm CPM Group.
“It’s been absolutely dismal," said Peter Thomas, senior vice president of metals at Zaner Precious Metals, a Chicago precious-metals dealer. “A lot of guys have been really hurting.”
Bitcoin has “taken some of the dedicated interest in gold away from gold,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE, who warned at a CME Group event in September that cryptocurrencies could pose a long-term threat to the precious metal.
CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange operator, said this week that it is aiming to launch a futures contract based on bitcoin by year-end, which could make it as easy to buy bitcoin futures as it is to buy gold or oil futures.
That is raising questions about whether this downturn in the gold retail business could be more serious and last longer than previous downturns.
Philip Lally, a manufacturing engineer, is one of the investors embracing cryptocurrencies this year, helping Bitcoin prices soar to record highs. While gold buyers historically have looked to the precious metal as a place to hide during a market selloff, Mr. Lally said virtual currencies are a new “hedge against chaos.”
Dwindling interest in the precious metal also reflects a surging stock market that is outshining even gold: The S&amp;P 500 index is up 15% and has closed at record highs 50 times this year. With returns like that, some longtime gold bugs are bailing on bullion.
“You can’t be parked in gold," said Casey Frazier, a government administrator in Woodstock, Conn., who used to hold nearly a third of his savings in gold. He has moved some of his money into the booming stock market, and now his precious-metals allocation is down to 10%.
Some small investors who used to buy gold coins, jewelry or watches are getting gold exposure through exchange-traded funds, which are much easier to buy and sell.
Investors have poured more than $8.5 billion into State Street ’s gold ETF, the largest gold ETF, since the end of 2015. That reversed three years of net outflows and marks the biggest period for inflows since 2009, according to FactSet.
Mr. Thomas of Zaner Precious Metals said authorized gold purchasers who buy directly from the U.S. Mint have been getting hurt, too, because of waning dealer demand. “They end up having to stockpile coins,” he said.
In September, gold dealer and authorized purchaser A-Mark Precious Metals , Inc., one of the few public companies in the industry, reported quarterly profits down 20% from a year ago. The amount of gold sold in ounces fell 59% from the same quarter last year.
“We’re looking for ways to just take market share and do more business in the current environment,” chief executive Gregory N. Roberts said during the earnings call.
He added that the company was “looking ahead in believing that this isn’t going to last forever,” but others sounded more bearish on the industry’s prospects.
“You would expect gold to be rocking at the present time, but it’s not," said Ross Norman, head of London-based gold dealer Sharps Pixley.
Sales of gold coins and bars soared during the financial crisis, when the metal reasserted its safe-haven status. In both 2009 and 2010, sales of American Eagle gold coins were more than four times sales this year by November, according to the U.S. Mint.
Now, with confidence in the economy growing, investors have been unloading their gold holdings, flooding a secondary market for gold coins and weighing on demand for newly minted coins.
Mr. Frazier, the retail investor, said he has had trouble selling some of his gold holdings in online groups and forums. “It was much more challenging,” he said. “There’s not a lot of buyers out there.”

IMO Bitcoin's raison d'etre is to serve as a global store of value, a trustworthy foundation upon which vibrant, fairer financial systems are built and less corrupt, more accountable political systems and societies develop. 
Private blockchains are anathema to the above vision, being controlled by a select and privileged few. These private systems may or may not be useful in other contexts but in no way nurture the type of society that most people want to live in (whether they realize it or not).

The creation of fiat out of thin air allows for greater centralization of economic and social decision making by governments.

I think the issue here is that you put a premium on making fiat money and using it as your gauge of wealth while I put a premium on holding bitcoins as a wealth asset. I think that over the long term and despite the higher volatility my strategy will be more successful.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:31:41
Bitcoin Cash team doesn't want to do that. They want to allow the free market to decide on the optimal blocksize and allow off-chain scaling solutions as needed. The current blocksize limit is an artificial man made limit which is likely making transaction fees far higher than would have otherwise been without the limit and therefore BTC is has less utility for transaction purposes. Ultimately this is a debate over economics, and whether or not the free market can be trusted, with a lot of misunderstanding and mudslinging clouding the bigger picture.

There is no big innovation with BCH but what it does have going for it is its community of investors and capital infrastructure in the form of mining hash power. Its code is also closer to Bitcoin's original code which has been able to secure value for 9 years.
I believe that most BCHers, including Roger Ver, support 2nd layer solutions but would also like to maximize on-chain scaling. There may be a subset (Craig Wright) that think that all scaling can be done on-chain. Meanwhile, if memory serves me correct Core supporters like Greg Maxwell do believe that on-chain scaling will be necessary at some point.
Ultimately, I think the scaling debate is more about how and when the decisions are made vs. what the actual scaling solutions are.

This is a terribly short-sighted statement and reveals a tremendous misunderstanding of the current global monetary situation; it explains why many here don't seem to appreciate the importance of smaller blocks. On the surface gold doesn't appear to have any current importance especially given its current falling fiat price. Behind the scenes however, and at the highest levels of the monetary world, central banks are making preparations whereby gold will once again assume its central role as a premier store of value. 
Do people really believe that the rest of the world, especially 'superproducers' with trade surpluses like China, are going to continue to support US largesse and deficits by purchasing US bonds as a store of value? Why would one save in an instrument whose underlying value can be debased through policies of the issuer like QE? These producer countries have been increasing their gold inventories for years now. Gold is more important than most people realize especially those people who are younger and live in the West.
Bitcoin is capable of acting as a digital form of gold as Satoshi envisioned, complementing the yellow metal and serving part of the world's honest stores of value. 
All that is needed is patience.

I'm not so sure that at the current moment there are any traditional 'safe havens'. At least there are no knowable safe havens for what turmoil may lie ahead. Central bank policies have distorted price discovery in bonds, stocks, real estate, and commodities. Policies like QE have even made cash suspect. Where does one hide? Where does one save their money today; right now? Geez, what even constitutes money? Literally, any of the above markets could implode practically overnight. Given the uncertainty, I believe that a diversified portfolio, which includes bitcoins, is the only thing that makes sense as a 'safe haven'. It may be that portfolios overweight bitcoins are in fact safer than traditional assets and perform better than anything else. So, while it may seem that the headline is ridiculous, it may not be as ridiculous as one may believe given the unique financial times we are living in.

With its thousand years of history, gold still has a tremendous network effect advantage over Bitcoin as a store of value. I'm not sure how long that will last but if I had to guess I'd say it'll take decades of Bitcoin proving itself as being immutable before it is trusted on the same level as gold. Again, this time frame is just a guess, innovation often surprises to the upside and dramatic shifts in perception and behavior can occur practically "overnight". Currently, there is no reason why people shouldn't want to hedge their bets and store some of their wealth in both gold and bitcoins. I think bitcoins and gold can exist side by side with individuals deciding for themselves what the right bitcoin to gold ratio is.

I agree that gold's storage and transport costs make it more susceptible to manipulation compared to Bitcoin.

It'll be a good idea to have both BTC and its analog equivalent; gold.

AFAIK the U.S. commercial banks keep their excess reserves deposited at their bank - The Federal Reserve. The Fed pays the commercial banks an interest rate of 0.25% to keep their excess reserves on deposit there. These interest payments are essentially risk free income for the banks. I believe that only when the banks think that the economy is improving, and that they could make more money by lending to the private sector, will they do so.

There is massive inflation it's just not as visible as it would be had the excess dollars been funneled into consumer goods. Instead the QE ended up in the stock market, housing, and government bonds.

I don't think they understand what 'counterparty risk' means.
If you have an electronic token that is a claim on physical gold held in someone else's vault, even if it is "allocated", you still have counterparty risk. The counterparty in this case is the vault operator or the insurer.  If either of those counterparties fails your electronic claim is worthless.

The password (aka passphrase) acts as the 25th word of the seed and must be remembered in order to retrieve coins should you lose your Trezor. You can opt to have no password (24 word seed) or as many different passwords as you like.  
Each password protected Trezor account acts as a completely separate wallet! So you can have 5 different passwords controlling 5 different Trezor wallets but all with the same 24 word seed. Lose the password though and you lose access to the coins in that wallet.

If you want to get even fancier the number of confirmations required before a transaction displays as being "completed" can be user defined and based on the amount of bitcoins being received.

I think you're too focused on the details and not seeing the broader picture. In the long run the better system/technology etc. usually wins. Bitcoin is so much better than government issued currencies that I really can't fathom it failing in the long run. A monetary system based on a predictable supply of money which is not centrally controlled is far superior to one with an unpredictable supply subject to the perceived wisdom of a small cadre of bankers. How long it will take for the migration from fiat to Bitcoin to take is anyone's guess. Timing these shifts in people's perception is a bitch but I'm betting that it's in the process of happening.

Anarchy in the Anarcho-capitalist sense means 'without **rulers**' not 'without **rules**' as many would have you believe such as u/Mr_Evil_MSc. 
An Anarcho-capitalist framework allows for the peaceful co-existence of whatever type of society you wish to live in; it simply does not allow one group of people to impose and force their views of how society should run on another group. Essentially, you can have communities of Communists, Socialists, and Libertarians all co-existing and living as they choose.
Private property rights and disputes in an AnCap society are handled via competing private free market based firms such as defense and legal firms. There is no monopoly power over security or law like we have today with governments assuming that role over a given geographic territory. This monopoly power of governments has enabled them to violate individual rights and commit atrocities such as countless genocides.

When the government needs money they can increase taxes or borrow it. Taxation isn't very popular so what they end up doing is sell bonds to investors and if no one wants to borrow the central bank will step in and buy the bonds with freshly created money. Central banks have created trillions of dollars over the past several years. If the central bank in the US for example didn't buy the bonds the government wouldn't have been able to maintain their levels of spending. This is why in the US the total debt continues to grow year after year With little appetite for cutting the size of government the trend will continue and probably end with the death of fiat currencies and a transition to a different monetary system. This process may take years to play out.

Democracy is basically one group of people trying to force their way of thinking upon others. It doesn't seem inherently civil or just when you think about it for more than a second. This shortcoming has become more apparent recently and is reflected in the polarization of political groups in countries dealing with financial crises.

It's really quite simple. To trust government fiat currencies means to trust that the government won't devalue the currency through inflation of the monetary base and that the government will be fiscally responsible and any public spending will be paid for through taxation.  
Has this happened? What does history show? History is crystal clear. The spending of all governments has ultimately been paid for through inflation, that is to say devaluation of the monetary base, and not at all through taxation. Taxation increases to pay for public spending is politically difficult. In fact, the most recent item on the Trump agenda calls for lower taxes. Couple this fact with talk of increased government spending on infrastructure and it becomes obvious that it will be paid for again via monetary inflation. This is not what I'd call a prescription for increasing trust in government issued currencies.  
Furthermore, much of the spending has historically been paid for through the sale of government bonds to willing foreign buyers. Data over the course of the past several years has shown that these buyers' appetite for lending is decreasing. The purchase of US debt by creditors like China has been slowing down considerably. In fact, if the appetite for US bonds was so robust there would have been no need for the Federal Reserve's trillion dollar plus quantitative easing program in which the Federal Reserve itself had to buy US bonds.  
A fiat monetary system is absolutely unsustainable. The US government can't reduce spending, won't pay for it via taxation, and our lenders won't lend us money. The only way out is via the so-called printing press. History has shown us that all governments resort to this tactic and the US will be no different.
Harker and similar fiat apologists are the ones living in an echo chamber and it is only a matter of time before their monetary bubble bursts.  
Place your bets. I know where I'm placing mine.

Bonds have negative yields because central banks are buying them. That's not a market determined interest rate, it's a manipulated one. Why would anyone use bonds as a store of value as they are denominated in a unit of account that can be diluted by central banks? It makes more sense to store ones wealth in something valuable and of limited supply like gold. Eventually (although exact timing is really difficult), I expect all of the central bank manipulations to fail and true price discovery to be realized. I don't think its as simple as saying we'll have deflation throughout our lifetimes. You never know what Black Swans are out there and predict what kinds of dramatic effects they can have on market psychology.

I think the vital first step is to remove government's monopoly power over money creation. When a government controls the currency they have far too much say in how it is spent. This power ultimately distorts the economy and leads to a less prosperous nation had the spending decisions been made by individuals acting in their own interests. There are currently far too many special interest groups working hand in hand with government officials to push their own agendas at the expense of the rest of us.

If there is a curse between the covers of this thin, self-satisfied volume, it doesn’t have to do with cash, the title to the contrary notwithstanding. Freedom is rather the subject of the author’s malediction. He’s not against it in principle, only in practice.  
Ken Rogoff is a chaired Harvard economics professor, a one-time chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and (to boot) a chess grandmaster. He laid out his case against cash in a Saturday essay in this newspaper two weeks ago. By abolishing large-denomination bills, he said there, the government could strike a blow against sin and perfect the Federal Reserve’s control of interest rates.  
“The Curse of Cash,” the Rogoffian case in full, comes in two parts. The first is a helping of monetary small bites: a little history (in which the gold standard gets the back of the author’s hand), a little central-banking practice, a little underground economy. It’s all in the service of showing where money came from and where it should be going.  
Terrorists traffic in cash, Mr. Rogoff observes. So do drug dealers and tax cheats. Good, compliant citizens rarely touch the $100 bills that constitute a sizable portion of the suspiciously immense volume of greenbacks outstanding—$4,200 per capita. Get rid of them is the author’s message.  
Then, again, one could legalize certain narcotics to discommode the drug dealers and adopt Steve Forbes’s flat tax to fill up the Treasury. Mr. Rogoff considers neither policy option. Government control is not only his preferred position. It is the only position that seems to cross his mind.  
Which brings us to the business end of this production. Come the next recession, the book’s second part contends, the Fed should have the latitude to drive interest rates below zero. Mr. Rogoff lays the blame for America’s lamentable post-financial-crisis economic record not on the Obama administration’s suffocating tax and regulatory policies. The problem is rather the Fed’s inability to put its main interest rate, the federal funds rate, where it has never been before.  
In a deep recession, Mr. Rogoff proposes, the Fed ought not to stop cutting rates when it comes to zero. It should plunge right ahead, to minus 1%, minus 2%, minus 3% and so forth. At one negative rate or another, the theory goes, despoiled bank depositors will stop saving and start spending. According to the worldview of the people who constitute what Mr. Rogoff fraternally calls the “policy community” (who elected them?), the spending will buttress “aggregate demand,” thus restore prosperity.  
You may doubt this. Mr. Rogoff himself sees difficulties. For him, the problem is cash. The ungrateful objects of the policy community’s statecraft will stockpile it.  
What would you do if your bank docked you, say, 3% a year for the privilege of holding your money? Why, you might convert your deposit into $100 bills, rent a safe deposit box and count yourself a shrewd investor. Hence the shooting war against currency. If the author has his way, there will be no more Benjamin Franklins, only Hamiltons, Lincolns and George Washingtons. Ideally, says Mr. Rogoff, many of today’s banknotes will take the future form of clunky, base-metal coins “to make it even more difficult to carry large quantities of currency.”  
It’s plenty difficult enough now. Federal statute makes greenbacks in five- and even four-figure sums virtually non-negotiable. Just try to buy a car with a briefcase full of “legal tender.” Or try to deposit those tens of thousands of green dollar bills in the bank. The branch manager would likely file a Suspicious Activity Report. This intelligence would reside with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as mandated by the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. The government seems to hate cash as much as the fashion-forward economists do.  
To such deep thinkers as Mr. Rogoff, 0% is only a number, not a boundary. It ought not to constrain an enlightened central bank, which strives to set a negative inflation-adjusted interest rate when prices are drooping. Thus, if the CPI should happen to come in at 1%, let the federal-funds rate be set at, say, minus 1%. If the CPI should measure minus 1% (meaning that prices are actually falling), let the funds rate register minus 3%.  
This is a big can of worms that the author has pried open. He assumes, first and foremost, that falling prices are a calamity. It is not such a calamity that many Americans don’t spend most of the weekend seeking them out. Still, the policy community wants nothing to do with them.  
And the policy community, especially in Europe, has had its way. More than $13 trillion of sovereign debt (German, Japanese, Swiss) is quoted at a yield of less than nothing. In Denmark, the banks pay homeowners to take out a mortgage. In Switzerland, depositors pay the bank to accept their francs.  
Negative rates? You rub your eyes and search your memory. You can recall no precedent. And if you consult the latest edition of “A History of Interest Rates” (2005) by Sidney Homer and Richard Sylla, you will find none. A recent check with Mr. Sylla confirms the impression. Today’s negative bond yields, he says, are the first in at least 5,000 years.  
A positive integer would almost seem inherent in the idea of interest. When most of us want something, we want it now. And if we don’t have the money to buy it now, we borrow. “Present goods are, as a rule, worth more than future goods of like kind and number,” posited the eminent 19th-century Austrian theorist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk. He called this behavioral truism the core of his theory of interest.

People with a difference of opinion as to how an open source project like Bitcoin should scale is not "an attack". What is "open-source governance" anyways? In my opinion it's allowing permissionless innovation; allowing people to tinker and do what they believe is best. This is the free market at work. If you don't like it sell all your Bcash and buy BTC. Bitcoin's success depends in part on its anti-fragility. If forking can kill Bitcoin then it should die. Bitcoin can't be defined by you, Core, Cash or anyone else. The market decides what is or isn't Bitcoin. Using the word "attack" makes me think that you believe that you know what is best for everyone or are entitled to something. You aren't.
Futhermore, all Bitcoin companies have incentive to see the value of Bitcoin maximized. You mention that exchanges only gain from "having a plethora of coins to trade"; well that only true if the coins have value. Why would an exchange want to undermine the value of the commodity upon which their business is based. Also, payment processors only want cheap transactions because their customers want cheap transactions. No one knows the right blocksize that optimally balances low transaction fees and censorship resistance. Bitcoin Core believes they know the answer while BCash believes the market is better suited at making that determination.

Then again, because not everyone is equally impatient, some of us are prepared to wait, therefore to lend. Seen in this light, the rate of interest is either the cost of impetuousness or the reward to thrift. In the topsy-turvy world of Mr. Rogoff, negative rates would be the reward to impetuousness and the cost of thrift. A small price to pay, he insists, for a quick exit from a deep slump.  
The author does not forget to salt his text with words of caution. They are unconvincing. Mr. Rogoff is a true believer in the discretionary command of monetary matters by former tenured economics faculty—the Ph.D. standard, let’s call it. Never mind that, in post-crisis America, near 0% interest rates have failed to deliver the promised macroeconomic goods. Come the next crackup, Mr. Rogoff would double down—and down.  
Curiosity is notable by its absence in these pages. How have we come to this radical pass? What is it about today’s monetary and banking arrangements that seems to impel us to more and more desperate policy gambits? The nature of modern central banking and the pseudoscience of modern monetary economics are themselves surely part of the problem.  
Interest rates are prices. They impart information. They tell a business person whether or not to undertake a certain capital investment. They measure financial risk. They translate the value of future cash flows into present-day dollars. Manipulate those prices—as central banks the world over compulsively do—and you distort information, therefore perception and judgment.  
The ultra-low rates of recent years have distorted judgment in a bullish fashion. True, they have not, at least in America, ignited a wave of capital investment—who needs it in a comatose economy? They have rather facilitated financial investment. They have inflated projected cash flows and anesthesized perceptions of risk (witness the rock-bottom yields attached to corporate junk bonds). In so doing, they have raised the present value of financial assets. Wall Street has enjoyed a wonderful bull market.  
The trouble is that the Fed has become hostage to that very bull market. The higher that asset prices fly, the greater the risk of the kind of crash that impels new rounds of intervention, new cries for government spending, bigger deficits—more “stimulus.” Interest rates today, in the U.S., are perilously close to zero. What will the mandarins do in the next emergency?  
You have to wonder if the agitators for negative interest rates read the newspapers. The crisis of state and municipal pension finance is no longer looming but upon us. In a world of 2% long-dated Treasury yields, the pension managers operate under the fanciful assumption that they can, on average, generate annual returns in excess of 7.5%. Just how America’s income-starved savers and pensioners would receive the news of the adoption of negative interest rates could be a fruitful topic for Mr. Rogoff’s next book; it plays no part in this one.  
You have never met a more cocksure lot than the monetary-policy clerisy. The author, one of the highest of these high priests, casts aside his pro forma concerns about radical experimentation to deliver the following prediction about the coming brave new world: “A true shift to a world where negative interest policy is possible will be transformative, comparable to moving off the gold standard in the 1930s, moving off of fixed exchange rates in the 1970s, and the advent of modern independent central banks around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. Like all of these changes, there will be uncertainties during the transition, but after awhile, central banks and financial market participants likely won’t be able to imagine doing things any other way.”  
It would make one more confident in such forecasts if the leading lights of the policy community had not been looking the wrong way in 2008. How did they miss the biggest event of their professional lives? The simple answer is that, though central bankers believe themselves to be independent of their governments (a debatable claim), they are hardly independent of each other or of the doctrines of John Maynard Keynes and his modern-day disciples.  
The Nobel physicist Richard Feynman had their number as long ago as 1974, when, in an address to the graduates of CalTech, he warned against “Cargo Cult Science.” He talked about the inhabitants of the South Seas who, after seeing a cargo plane once land on their island, build makeshift runways and don bamboo headphones to re-create the setting in which the plane would land again. Cargo-cult scientists, like the islanders, do everything right, Feynman said: They “follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they’re missing something essential, because the planes don’t land.”  
So it is with monetary policy. The economists build their runways and don their headphones. They create their econometric models and decorate their scholarly papers with mathematical appendices. Like the hopeful cargo cultists, they faithfully implement the rigmarole of modern science. Still, the economic planes don’t land.  
Meteorology is a legitimate science, though anyone with a weather app on a smartphone knows how fallible the meteorologists are—how frequently they revise their forecasts of the short-term future of such inanimate things as raindrops. How much less reliable, then, are the economists who presume to forecast human behavior not just over the course of days but over the sweep of years?  
As for the campaign for zero cash in the service of negative interest rates, Mr. Rogoff’s brief is best seen not as detached scientific analysis but as a kind of left-wing crotchet. Strip away the technical pretense and what you have is politics. The author wants the government to control your money. It’s as simple as that.

Blockchain Art Exhibitions Explore the Bitcoin Technology’s Future
Sept 7, 2016 By Steven Norton  
Two shows by artist Simon Denny, in New York and Berlin, look at competing views on how the little-understood technology underpinning the digital currency bitcoin should develop—and helps translate them for viewers
Simon Denny uses cultural references like computer cases to explore blockchain.
Pokémon, postage stamps and the strategy board game Risk. Simon Denny uses everyday objects like these to illuminate how technology shapes the way we live and work. In his latest exhibition, the Berlin-based New Zealand artist explores blockchain, the little-understood technology underpinning the digital currency bitcoin.
Opening Thursday at New York’s Petzel Gallery, “Blockchain Future States” looks at competing views about how the technology should evolve. Large cutout images of the leaders of three leading blockchain companies—Digital Asset Holdings LLC, 21 Inc. and Ethereum—stand near globe-like structures meant to highlight how new currency systems could challenge traditional forms of statehood. A Risk board for each firm lays out the company’s strategy to create a new world order. A similar installation, “Blockchain Visionaries,” is at the Berlin Biennale until Sept. 18.
That contemporary artists are exploring blockchain further suggests the technology has reached a level of cultural significance beyond bitcoin’s initial hype. Today, companies from global banks to auto makers and blue-chip tech firms are experimenting with blockchain to find new ways to speed up financial transactions or create safer supply chains.  
For many, though, the technology remains an obscure subject. Encountering it in a gallery setting can help audiences look beyond digital coins or lines of code and address broader questions about how technology shapes future societies, Mr. Denny says. Seeing the technology through the lens of everyday objects like a Risk board creates a cultural entryway into a highly technical subject (a decentralized transaction ledger) that might bore the average viewer.
“Pretty much everyone who walks into that room will have some relationship to Risk,” says the 33-year-old artist.
Mr. Denny first encountered blockchain in the context of bitcoin. It didn’t interest him much at first. “Friends were just buying drugs with it,” he says.
But a “2.0 moment” came around 2015, as banks and other firms spent more time and money figuring out how to build upon the underlying technology. “I became interested in how different people with different types of agendas are invested in the future of what this could be,” Mr. Denny says.
“Blockchain Future States” sets out his observations. His Risk board for Digital Asset replaces countries with financial capitals—reflecting the fact that the firm, led by former J.P. Morgan Chase JPM &amp; Co. executive Blythe Masters, is creating a platform geared toward financial markets. The board for 21 Inc., which focuses more on bitcoin, eschews traditional geography for nationalist lands and technologist clouds, while Ethereum, an open software platform, is set in outer space.  
To acquaint visitors with the foundations of blockchain, Mr. Denny intersperses popular icons—Pokémon protagonist Ash and a giant game box—with the mythology surrounding bitcoin creator (or creators) Satoshi Nakamoto.
While the Berlin show doesn’t include the Risk boards or digital monsters, it benefits greatly from its location: a former East German State Council building that’s now part of a management school. Mr. Denny says the space highlights a physical meeting point of different systems of governance, which encourages new ways of looking at markets and sovereignty.  
The artist says his goal isn’t to come to a solid conclusion about which blockchain future is better, but to tease out the possible opportunities and obstacles of each. “When people come across new technologies like this, they’re just not sure,” he says. “I’m coming in as a fan and optimist, but not as a blind publicist.”

My example was in response to your use of the term 'unregulated' which clearly has no impact on whether or not a market can be manipulated as shown by central bank interventions. Also, while traders can use manipulation in the short term I believe that the long term trend can't be manipulated and more closely reflects the true value of what is being traded. Bitcoin's price rise over the past 6 months is far more likely a reflection of supply/demand dynamics than miner manipulation.

Decentralization is not the goal. Decentralization is a means to an end with the end being censorship resistance. If decentralization were the key then why stop at 1MB blocks? Why not 0.9MB? 0.5? How about 1kb? How many nodes are required to ensure censorship resistance? 100000? 5000? 500? 50? 
Clearly there are tradeoffs between utility as a payment network/store of value and the amount of decentralization. How do we as a community find the blocksize which will at the same time maximize utility while ensuring censorship resistance? Some knowledgeable people believe that limiting on-chain transactions and favoring off-chain tx is the right path forward for now while other thoughtful individuals believe that pushing on-chain tx to the limits is the better option.
In my opinion the free market will sort this out. I am glad that we now have two competing forks of Bitcoin, which hasn't resulted in Bitcoin's death as many predicted, and am hopeful that the best scaling solution will become evident over the next several years. In the meantime I will continue to hold equal amounts of BCH and BTC.

Because fiat means by 'decree'.  
Decrees are the opposite of voluntary agreements.  
The term fiat currency means a currency which becomes currency because a government demands that its citizens use it.
The fact that private banks, borrowers and lenders subsequently agree on how that currency is used it immaterial. The government wants all citizens to use the currency which they are in control of. That's why governments hate gold and Bitcoin; they can't control its production or on what it is spent. Fiat currency funds the enormous welfare/warfare state and transfers power from people to bureaucrats.

There's a big difference between buying bad paper and buying good bitcoins. The banks were happy to give away the paper.

The existing laws on the books severely limit the freedom of use of both Bitcoin and traditional currency.

In addition, cases of P2P exchangers going to jail for rules violations is immoral.

As the Fed went into the open market and started purchasing bitcoins their price would rise significantly. The more they buy the higher the price goes. They can print as many dollars as they want but they'd become worthless long before the supply of bitcoins is exhausted. In addition, as they buy and the price rises more businesses would shift from accepting fiat to bitcoin thus closing the loop without a need for fiat conversion. Lastly, there is no point in the Fed controlling all the crypto without eventually spending it back into the real economy and thus putting it back in the hands of those who they originally took it from.

You said taxation gives it "inherent value". It doesn't. 
If you want to move the goal posts fine. Taxation can give currency value at the start. Unfortunately, the outcome of fiat currency is predictable due to the fallibility of central bankers; due to human nature. That is, whenever there is a financial crisis they will bail out the system with newly created money. This is what happens with all fiat currencies and will happen to the US dollar despite it being the world reserve currency. If you can't see that post QE1,2 and 3, post China and Russia's accumulating gold hand over fist for the past several years, post sovereign states unloading US treasuries, and believe that everything is going to be fine then I wish you luck. Message me when the Fed has unwound its balance sheet, gold and bitcoins are in the shitter, and interest rates are back to normal. It won't happen. It can't happen. It's simple arithmetic. Oh and one last thing, to claim that the Federal Reserve is apolitical is insane.

If rates spike because of Fed bond selling where does the US get the money to pay for the interest on their 20 trillion dollars worth of debt? It either has to come from selling more bonds (to who I don't know as the Fed is selling and this bond issuance would cause interest rates to rise even higher) or increasing taxes (probably politically difficult to impossible). A third option is for the Fed to stop their bond selling and become a buyer which would mean more QE.

As the Fed went into the open market and started purchasing bitcoins their price would rise significantly. The more they buy the higher the price goes. They can print as many dollars as they want but they'd become worthless long before the supply of bitcoins is exhausted. In addition, as they buy and the price rises more businesses would shift from accepting fiat to bitcoin thus closing the loop without a need for fiat conversion. Lastly, there is no point in the Fed controlling all the crypto without eventually spending it back into the real economy and thus putting it back in the hands of those who they originally took it from.

There are philosophical differences between the 2 main camps which will never be resolved. The best way to proceed is for each to go their separate ways, put forth coins with properties they believe have the most utility, and let the market decide their value.

I agree that BTC is not a currency yet. I don't see how any new commodity can be bootstrapped into the role of a currency without massive volatility. That being said I'm almost certain that the long term BTC trend is up and that the long term trend for paper currencies continues to be down. Based on the way the monetary and political systems are structured I can't envision a scenario where federal debts diminish, government spending decreases, and the money supply doesn't increase.

Because it's a far superior money compared to fiat currency. People will want to use the better  product. Fiat currency loses value over time because it is inflationary while Bitcoin's purchasing power increases due to it's relatively limited supply. In additon, Bitcoin can't be censored while fiat currency can. I predict that the future will look very much like the past 9 years of increasing Bitcoin adoption and price rises.

I think the recent hard fork was a good example of stress that proved Bitcoin's anti-fragility whereby it 'mutated' into 2 separate chains. The fork could be purging Bitcoin of a community with economic ideals which don't serve user's best interests in the long term or perhaps the fork allows competing interests to be served better than one chain could. In either scenario Bitcoin seems stronger and more valuable to me and the price rise seems to indicate that the market believes so too.

1. It was a radical innovation in the sense of how all of those pieces were put together to form the first scarce decentralized immutable digital commodity.  
2. All value is subjective. Bitcoin serves a purpose as digitil money which is scarce and not issued by a government. People value that. The fact that there is risk of losing it or it being hacked is completely irrelevant. It's like arguing that gold, which has remained valuable for millennia, isn't valuable because it can be lost or stolen.    
The vast amounts of energy are needed to ensure the security and discovery of bitcoins. Without that energy usage (ie. work) bitcoins wouldn't be secure, counterfeit-proof or scarce.  
3. Put your tin foil hat away. You're postulating some grand conspiracy where all the exchanges across the globe, not to mention peer to peer markets like LocalBitcoin, are colluding to hide true price discovery. Any price mismatch with the real market price would be arbitraged away by traders.   
In addition, all fiat currencies can be and are priced in other currencies. That's what the whole FOREX market is; speculation! Sure BTC is more volatile but that's only because its size is minute compared to government currencies. Volatility has and will continue to decrease over time as BTC grows.  
4. Bitcoin is NOT an Ponzi by definition. Ponzi's promise guaranteed returns, are opaque, and are tightly controlled by a conman. When a Ponzi bubble bursts the Ponzi ends with a value of 0 never to recover. Bitcoin has had multiple bubbles, bursts and recoveries in its history yet has gained in value.

Any item can be exchanged for a near infinite number of other items one of which is money. The fact is exchange rates are independent of one another.

Saying that 1 cryptocurrency's supply has any bearing on a separate cryptocurrency's is obviously false.
Anyone can fork Bitcoin today and create a currency with a near infinite number of coins. According to Schiff that should immediately hyperinflate Bitcoin.

Forget Bitcoin, think IMFcoin. The head of the International Monetary Fund has been musing about the future of money, and thinks there is a decent chance it will come from the guardian of the world’s monetary system.
Christine Lagarde, IMF managing director, held up the organization’s special drawing rights (SDRs) as having a possible digital future at a Bank of England forum last week, and put what she said was a “question mark” over whether SDRs could replace existing international currencies. “It’s not a far-fetched hypothetical,” she said, and the IMF needs to be ready.
The SDR is a long way from the digital disruption that cypherpunks hope cryptocurrency can deliver. Dreamed up in the 1960s, SDRs are a kind of artificial currency whose value depends on other currencies. Dollars are a part of it, but so are euros, sterling, renminbi and yen. An SDR is a bit like a currency mutual fund for central banks.
For decades it has been an afterthought in the global financial system, but the IMF has spent the past year thinking about how to give SDRs a broader international role. So could some sort of crypto-SDR eventually replace the dollar as the world’s money?
The idea has heavyweight support from those who want to diminish the dollar’s status, notably in China. People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan called in 2009 for wider use of the IMF’s money to “gradually replace existing reserve currencies with the SDR,” one reason for the latest review.
The reasons are well-rehearsed, and not digital. China—and other emerging markets—would like to diversity their risk away from dollars. They also worry about the inherent problem of using national money for global reserves. When the U.S. faces a conflict between domestic and international needs, it is likely to favor its voters over the world economy.
So what would digital SDRs add? When monetary economists are drawing up dream scenarios, they often come up with something similar to the “bancor” presented by John Maynard Keynes at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference. International trade would be conducted in bancors with rules about the size of overdrafts allowed, preventing imbalances getting too big.
SDR or IMFcoins would allow a much wider group to use the currency, supplanting the dollar in international trade and reducing both the big currency swings that can destabilize countries and the dangers of large current account deficits. Instead of representing a basket of currencies, the digital SDR would be a currency of its own, albeit one only used for international transactions.
A more limited alternative would try to speed global growth. At the moment, countries hold big piles of dollars as a form of insurance against a balance of payments crisis, damping growth and distorting the world economy. If the IMF was empowered to act more like a global central bank, whisking up new SDRs on its own blockchain in a crisis, it would reduce the need for countries to hold reserves.
José Antonio Ocampo, a Colombian central bank board member also on the IMF’s expert group considering the future of the SDR, thinks annual SDR issuance could be worth $200 billion to $300 billion a year.
“Countries would not have to accumulate reserves, [which] generate a general contractionary effect on the global economy,” he says.
The prospect of giving the IMF the ability to execute global helicopter drops of money worries believers in strong currencies.
Jim Rickards, an author and former general counsel for failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, thinks SDRs will be issued to reflate the system in the next crisis, hurting the dollar’s reserve status. “It’s all converging on a world where the dollar will just be a local currency like the Mexican peso,” he says. He is a longstanding advocate of using gold to back money to limit the supply.
The real opposition to an IMFcoin is likely to come not from fans of gold, but from defenders of the dollar’s central role in the global system. Sterling once held the role of global reserve currency, and spent decades in decline once it was abandoned in favor of the dollar, reducing demand for pounds.
The benefit of having the reserve currency is obvious, and much-envied: Americans can offer to buy real things from the rest of the world with money the Federal Reserve creates out of nothing, and other countries have little choice but to accept. The U.S. gets lower interest rates than it otherwise would and can run a permanent current-account deficit with impunity—just so long as it remains the reserve currency.
There is a downside to having the reserve currency, though. The purchase of dollars by the rest of the world makes it harder for the U.S. to devalue to support its own economy. When the banking crisis hit in 2008 investors piled into the reserve currency, and the dollar soared 21% against its trading partners before the panic abated in March 2009. Instead of the weaker currency central banks usually aim for in a recession, the U.S. got a stronger currency.
There is little chance U.S. politicians will want to give up what a French finance minister once called the “exorbitant privilege” of the dollar, no matter what Ms Lagarde, another former French finance minister, might suggest. As she noted, the IMF would need a “geopolitical situation that would be propitious” for the changes she is speculating about to happen.
China wants it, and has been encouraging the issuance of SDR-denominated bonds to try to create a true alternative to the deep and liquid markets of the U.S. (China’s had little success so far, with only two SDR bonds outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters). Ms. Lagarde’s paean to the future suggests she likes the idea. Luckily for those holding dollars, the geopolitical situation is still tilted in favor of the U.S., and there is little prospect we all be trading in IMFcoins any time soon.

The situation was very different in the past when banks could not issue credit out of thin air.
In the past when banks charged for holding your money the money was gold. The gold wasn't lent out and the fee was essentially a storage fee much like safety deposit boxes today. One could elect to lend their money to the bank in return for interest payments to compensate for default risk. The banks would in turn lend the money to borrowers at a higher interest rate thereby earning income on the spread between the rate at which they borrowed from you and lent to their customers.
The first few chapters of this book gives a great historical overview of banking.

Pre-fork coins are valid on either A or B fork correct?
If I spend pre-fork coins will any change I receive remain spendable on either fork?


Don't you think this is risky? If one of the forks is attacked because it no longer has enough hashing power all of the coins on that fork would become worthless. What percent of bitcoins would be lost and how would this loss of coins effect people's ability to price things?  If there is a chance that one of the forks will lose value there is an incentive for pre-fork bitcoin holders to not spend pre-fork coins and wait until one of the forks fail. 


What the world needs more than anything is a trustless **store of value** not a trustless **medium of exchange**. Sorry you can't have both. There will always be a tradeoff at the margins. How do you store your wealth today? Do you keep it safe in government bonds or the stock market? Bonds' value are eroded through inflation while the stock market is prone to crashes and is not reasonable for those close to retirement. 
Bitcoin as a store of value is made less trustworthy as it becomes more difficult to run a full node. I want to be able to keep my savings in my own wallet with full control of the private keys. When I need to spend some money I'll send a fraction of my hard earned wealth to my Coinbase or Circle account for off-chain transactions. The blocksize increase needed to allow for on-chain microtransactions would be so large that only a few organizations would be capable of hosting a full node. I don't trust that scenario.

By Rob Curran  
Oct. 8, 2017 10:16 p.m. ET
Ask most people about the bitcoin bubble, and they’ll probably have the same reaction: It’s interesting, but it won’t affect me. After all, they’ll figure, they aren’t investing in bitcoin, so if there is a bubble, and it does burst, they’ll be just fine.
Well, maybe they should start worrying.
The market for cryptocurrencies—digital tokens used to transfer money between individuals’ computers with minimal fees—has grown in stature in recent years and is increasingly entwined with broader financial markets as well, a trend that is likely to continue. Bitcoin is now traded by some of the institutional investors around which bond and stock markets revolve. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.46% is considering opening bitcoin-trading operations. Cryptocurrencies also are being used to raise capital by more companies.
As the bubble grows, analysts say, a crash has a greater chance of affecting investor sentiment about stocks, especially in the technology and financial sectors.
“Any product that blows up, there’s always collateral damage,” says Joe Kinahan, chief market strategist at brokerage TD Ameritrade . Tech and financial “companies who are relying on it for business, and those who have put a significant investment into the [blockchain] infrastructure would be the first” to suffer collateral damage, Mr. Kinahan says.
What has some market observers concerned is that in less than six months, bitcoin went from around $1,000 a token to $5,000. It is back now to $4,400. But in early 2016, bitcoin was trading at less than $400, bringing its 18-month gain to 1,000%. Consider that the math-based currency has yet to find a widespread use outside of speculation, and warnings of an implosion from J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive James Dimon and others in the financial establishment sound like more than curmudgeonry.
At around $150 billion, the market capitalization of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is up by a factor of roughly eight this year, according to the Cointelegraph website. If this growth rate continues, what’s now a relatively small part of global investible assets could become a significant one, says Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund and a student of the history of speculation. By next year, Mr. Di Mattia expects the bubble to have inflated to the point where a pop could send a shock wave through the stock market.
Another analyst says bitcoin is at a similar stage in its development as the internet was in 1994, early in the speculative bubble. “What we’re looking at is a new technology that people are still trying to understand,” says Matthew Gertler, senior analyst and counsel at Digital Asset Research, which provides research to institutional investors on cryptocurrency issues.
Give bitcoin its due: Most people in finance agree that bitcoin and the blockchain, the open-access ledger that underpins the currency, were great inventions; even as J.P. Morgan’s Mr. Dimon derides bitcoin as a “fraud,” his bank is working on its own blockchain technology.
The bitcoin invention goes back to a 2008 blueprint signed by Satoshi Nakamoto and circulated on the internet. When a bitcoin owner transfers a token to another person, he or she posts the transaction to the blockchain, a simple account book floating on the internet, signing it with a unique string of numbers and letters. Bitcoin “miners” verify the transaction by running those numbers through formulas on high-powered computers, work for which they are paid mostly in newly minted bitcoin. For the users, fees are relatively low and transactions are—in theory—fraud-proof.
Clever as it is, however, bitcoin has shown no signs of replacing the dollar and other “fiat” currencies.
“For bitcoin to be a success, it needs to take a large part of various markets—remittances, payments, stored value,” says Mr. Gertler.
Meanwhile, speculation in bitcoin—driven by hopes of its wider adoption—actually has diminished its usefulness as a means of exchange.
“Say you agree to buy a car [in bitcoin] and the price on Saturday is $32,000 and because of a bitcoin move, on Monday it’s $41,000—people just can’t live their lives like that,” says Mr. Kinahan of TD Ameritrade.
Nvidia vulnerable  
A crash in the price of leading cryptocurrencies would almost certainly hurt shares of Nvidia Corp. NVDA +2.60% , the chip maker that was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&amp;P 500 in 2016, and its rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., at least temporarily. Both companies have noted in their quarterly filings that cryptocurrency miners are a key source of demand for their graphic chips. Sales of chips to cryptocurrency sources represented 6.7% of Nvidia’s fiscal second-quarter revenue of $2.23 billion.
“Anybody getting more than 5% of their business from crypto, it’s starting to become significant and you could see their stock prices very quickly collapse” in the event of a bubble bursting, says Mr. Kinahan.
Spokesmen for Nvidia and AMD declined to comment for this article.
Other companies at risk include those in financial technology, or “fintech,” one of the hottest parts of the tech sector. Shares of the exchange-traded fund Global X FinTech (FINX), a basket of such stocks, are up 43% in 2017.
“A lot of the innovation around financial tech has to do with blockchain these days,” says Gil Luria, director of institutional equity research at brokerage DA Davidson. “So if the crypto asset values decline and that’s associated with the blockchain innovations, there could be some carry-over effect.” That possibility has some observers worried about the broader tech sector, as well, where investors are already uneasy about elevated valuations.
Another concern is the use of cryptocurrencies by some startups as a funding mechanism. Companies such as teen-oriented chat application Kik Interactive are using bitcoin-like systems to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from crowdsourced investors overnight, skirting initial-public-offering regulations and avoiding tough questions from venture capitalists. In many ICOs, or initial coin offerings, companies don’t have a product yet when they sell these stakes, says Mr. Gertler.
Shares of the online retailer Overstock.com shot up recently after it said it was exploring a trading platform for ICOs. “To the extent there’s any negative changes [in the value of cryptocurrencies], that could be to their detriment,” Mr. Luria says.
Fears about fraudulent ICOs, meanwhile, caused Chinese regulators to shut down local bitcoin exchanges recently, causing a 20% retreat in bitcoin prices.
In 18 months, however, a new bitcoin crash could have wider ramifications.
That is when Spencer Bogart, head of research with cryptocurrency investment firm Blockchain Capital, estimates that the first bitcoin ETF will reach the market. The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a high-profile ETF proposal from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss earlier this year, citing the lack of regulation and transparency on underlying bitcoin exchanges. But LedgerX LLC recently received Commodity Futures Trading Commission permission to trade and clear bitcoin options and futures. ETF firm ProShares filed an application for long and short funds that would track bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has said it would apply for approval of these derivatives.
An ETF’s effect?  
The appearance of an ETF would result in another surge in speculative activity as small investors wary of the high-tech bitcoin markets and institutional investors obliged to trade only registered securities finally have a way in, say Mr. Bogart and others.
“We see it on our desk every day,” said Bobby Cho, at Cumberland Mining, a bitcoin-focused unit of Chicago proprietary trading firm DRW Investments LLC that works with institutional investors. “Many just go ahead and trade the underlying [tokens], but many more are just sitting on the sidelines waiting for a product…. There’s a lot of pent-up demand for such a product.”
One sign of that demand is the wild behavior of the closest thing to an ETF on the market, the over-the-counter-traded Bitcoin Investment Trust.  Owing to the trust’s design, where shares must be owned by wealthy investors for a year before they can sell, there is a limited supply. This shortage became acute when fund manager Grayscale Investments LLC suspended creation of new shares in January while it sought SEC approval for an exchange listing (it abandoned that particular effort in late September). For about four months, the fund traded at nearly a 100% premium to its bitcoin holdings. Usually spreads between ETFs and the underlying indexes are measured in fractions of percentage points.
Currently, bitcoin markets have very limited links to stocks, bonds and commodities, allowing for some quarantine. An ETF would allow for the kind of “contagion”—the forced selling of seemingly unrelated assets—that bring on financial crises.
Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of agency brokerage Themis Trading, says that if the SEC approves an ETF based on bitcoin futures, it would sow the seeds for a market crisis.
“You’re going to put a derivative on a derivative of an unregulated asset?” says Mr. Saluzzi. “That, to me, is a recipe for disaster.”

OK. I found some additional Federal Reserve Bank info here 
We can see in Table 7 titled "Collateral Held against Federal Reserve Notes: Federal Reserve Agents' Accounts" an entry for gold certificates valued at around 11 billion USD while US bonds, agency debt, and mortgage backed securities represent the vast majority of collateral for Federal Reserve Notes at 1300 billion USD.
In other words, gold certificates represent less than 1% of the collateral backing cash while the other 99% of backing comes from US debt (ie. promises to pay cash), "toxic" mortgages that only the Federal Reserve wanted to buy through their QE program, and  [agency debt](
If we go back to my initial link we notice in Table 1 titled "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions" there is an entry listed as "Gold Stock" with a value of roughly 11 billion USD. I suspect this is the actual gold bars that the certificates represent and I also suspect that the gold is valued at roughly 42$ per ounce and not ~1200$ per ounce. 
Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve has more liabilities than simply its Federal Reserve Notes. In additon, electronic reserve deposits are a Fed liability. All in all, the Fed has $4427 billion worth of liabilities of which only a small fraction of a percent is backed by about 262 million ounces (around 8200 tons) of gold. This tonnage is what seems to be frequently quoted as the amount of gold that the U.S. actually holds.
If only gold and mortgage backed securities were to collateralize all of the outstanding reserves (both the cash Federal Reserve Notes and electronic reserves) the price of gold per ounce would be in the neighborhood of $10.000 USD per oz! This is making the assumption that the mortgages that the Fed own have full face value.

Not only is it libertarian fan **fiction** but it's Bank of England **reality**.
Up until a few years ago I used to think that there was a multiplier ratio as well. It turns out there isn't but that lending is constrained but other factors namely interest rates set by the central banks.
Here is a quote from a [recent BofE publication]( on the matter:
"Another common misconception is that the central bank
determines the quantity of loans and deposits in the
economy by controlling the quantity of central bank money
— the so-called ‘money multiplier’ approach. In that view,
central banks implement monetary policy by choosing a
quantity of reserves. And, because there is assumed to be a
constant ratio of broad money to base money, these reserves
are then ‘multiplied up’ to a much greater change in bank
loans and deposits. For the theory to hold, the amount of
reserves must be a binding constraint on lending, and the
central bank must directly determine the amount of reserves.
**While the money multiplier theory can be a useful way of
introducing money and banking in economic textbooks, it is
not an accurate description of how money is created in reality.**
Rather than controlling the quantity of reserves, central banks
today typically implement monetary policy by setting the
price of reserves — that is, interest rates."
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:55:14
Yes. Exactly. During "Quantitative Easing" The Federal Reserve purchased mortgages (Mortgage Backed Securities) from the banks with newly created base money. The Fed also bought billions of dollars worth of government bonds. 
Absent the Fed, the price of houses would be much lower today (good for home buyers, bad for sellers) while the price of bonds would be much lower with associated higher interest rates (good for savers, bad for borrowers like the government).
This raises the question: How will the Fed reverse this process? It reasons that the Federal Reserve was the buyer of last resort for these MBSs and bonds. There were no other willing buyers for these assets; that's why QE was necessary. So the question remains: How does the Fed sell something that no one wanted to buy in the first place?

So if there is a hard fork how will wallets differentiate between bitcoins using the original fork vs. bitcoins on the new fork? Will the coins be labeled in some way?
Also, I assume there are altcoins already out there that have larger block sizes yet their adoption has been minimal. Why would a fork of Bitcoin be any different? Are miners really going to mine on the newer fork? How much of the hashing power will be split between the old and new forks? How does the whole "game theory" of incentives play out? Personally, I would not use my bitcoins on the new fork until it proved it was safe. That may take years. I'm sure I'm not the only one.
Why not use off-chain transactions instead of a hard fork? So what if trust is involved. You will always have to trust someone like the seller when spending your coins. You don't need as much trust for a medium of exchange as you need for a store of value.  Besides, won't less nodes with the larger blocksize lead to more risks anyways? 
Sorry for the rambling but this fork issue has always made me nervous.

I disagree with his wording. People place their trust in money based on the underlying qualities of the money. People will place their trust in the money with the most predictable features because no trust or promises are needed.
No trust is needed for example when the supply schedule of the money is known in advance and can't be artificially inflated. This is true of BTC and mostly true for gold. It's a fact that there will be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins.
Fiat currencies require an enormous amount of faith that central bankers keep their issuance stable and predictable. Of course this hasn't happened and can't happen as fiat currency is subject to the whims of humans who will always print more fiat in times of crises to save the system.

Here's another link from the Bank of England explaining [how modern banking works] ( One important point is that **there is no longer a reserve ratio requirement.** (see page 17 for details) limiting how much money the banks can lend/create but there are other limiting factors. Keep in mind that they are talking about broad money created by banks and not base money, Federal Reserve Notes (ie. cash) and electronic reserves, that are created by central banks. The amount of base money that can be created is unlimited. See this chart

What do you think is the so-called intrinsic value of a 100 dollar bill? Episodes of hyperinflation prove that when governments abuse their mandate and create too much money that money becomes worthless because of a lack of confidence in the currency. Like gold, Bitcoin can't hyperinflate because it is limited in supply. This property instills confidence and is a feature which makes Bitcoin intrinsically superior to paper money.
In addition, being digital is great because it means I don't have to be in the presence of the person I have to transact with. It's similar to the benefit of me being able to send you this Reddit post as opposed to a handwritten paper letter in the snail mail.

@_date: 2015-09-27 01:46:50
Not many people in the Western world currently use gold as a store of value because that role has been usurped by government issued bonds. This situation is likely to change as people realize their error in saving in an instrument whose value can be debased through the creation of new units of fiat currency in which those bonds are denominated. I don't know when this transition will happen but I'm confident that it will and stores of value like physical gold and bitcoins will capture a significant proportion of the multitrillion dollar bond market.
@_date: 2015-04-20 12:20:56

As far as I understand it when a commercial bank creates money they don't create actual Federal Reserve Notes (ie. cash), they create a credit in your account which is their liability and is offset by an equal asset which is the loan they made to you. If you then decide to withdraw cash that will come from their general pool of funds. There is not enough cash available should everyone decide to go to their bank and withdraw their entire account.

The US has had a trade deficit for decades averaging in the neighborhood of 40$ billion per month. This has been possible because of the willingness of out creditors to overproduce and underconsume. In exchange they have been stockpiling US debt instruments whose underlying unit of value, the dollar, has been diluted enormously over the past several years through QE and expansion of the monetary base. In fact, QE was only necessary because not enough non-Fed participants had enough faith to buy them. This situation is unsustainable and therefore will come to an end, it also helps explain why the Fed is so reluctant to raise interest rates with a national debt of 18$ trillion lurking.

Over the course of the next few years the price stabilized around 350$ per coin and now 650$. Is it worth the risk to spend an additional 35000$-65000$ at that point to increase your holdings from 1000 to 1100 coins? For most people it doesn't.

It seems like the onus is on yourself to explain this phenomenon rather than on those who claim that absence of 'use value' is not a barrier for Bitcoin's success. 
I believe Bitcoin's value will continue to arise from demand for its unique properties which make it the best form of money in the digital age. I can't think of anything that I'd rather use as money and a store of value than Bitcoin.

The FDIC is sufficient for dealing with failing 3rd tier banks but if a Bank of America, Citi, or other TBTF bank runs into trouble the FDIC won't be able to help.

This is a killer feature Bitcoin has over something like gold. If the price drops significantly a lot of regular Joes are standing by waiting to purchase this scarce asset which can't be created out of thin air and can easily be delivered to a personal wallet where it will be taken out of circulation. This has the effect of redistributing coins from weaker to stronger hands over the course of time and leads to ever increasing prices in the long term. Central bankers understand this and I predict will eventually end up buying bitcoins as reserve assets.
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:31:15


A few short years ago when bitcoins were trading at less than 1$ it would have sounded ridiculous to hear someone claim that bitcoins would be worth over 200$? Yet here we are after a crash from 1200$!. Almost all attempts regarding bitcoin price projections have been way off base. To claim that it'll **"probably"** take 10 years to reach 10,000$ is bold.

We will never be able to get consensus on this issue which is reflected by all the hemming and hawing. Bitcoin is already beyond the monolithic user stage. We have people in the **store of value camp** like the guys at bitcoin-assets irc and "gold bugs" and those in the **medium of exchange camp** like Techies and those who believe in "blockchains but not bitcoins". If there is a hard fork I don't think things will go smoothly. Even if the majority of individuals want a blocksize increase there is a powerful minority of users who control a large proportion of the coins who feel differently and are willing to take steps to protect their interests.

Yeah, I agree with this. I didn't mean to imply that one won't be able to increase their bitcoin holdings at all but rather not in a significant % compared to what they have pre 1 to 2 bubbles.

No problem. I'm educating myself in the process as answering your questions helps me solidify some of my understanding. You should critically evaluate and verify all that I'm saying. That blog by FOFOA is a beast but there's a lot of great info in it. Generally, there seem to be 2 main schools of economics with the mainstream one being Keynesian and the other being the Austrian school. I think they boil down to Keynesianism believing in centralized control and planning being necessary to keep an economy stable while the Austrians believe in free markets and decentralization.
Back to your question though:
Seeing, as the US is the world's reserve currency it does have the most to lose should bitcoins or gold or something else come along to dominate world trade. I don't think that any country at this early stage of Bitcoin would switch to using it as a reserve but nothing is impossible. Keep in mind that every central bank does have gold as an asset on its balance sheet despite the fact that many so-called "respected economists" consider it a "barbarous relic". If central banks were to consider bitcoins for a reserve asset I think they'd only do so after bitcoins proved themselves in the free market amongst "the people".

What percentage of the individuals working in banking understand the moral arguments for or against different monetary systems?

A lot of people dislike GBTC because of the large premium involved and the COIN ETF's pending approval. I think it's important to understand that there are scenarios where the GBTC premium disappears but the price still rises. For example, if the COIN ETF were approved tomorrow and the price of BTC doubled we would see the GBTC share price rise and the premium disappear. Also, there is a risk that the COIN ETF isn't approved for awhile longer and in the interim we get another BTC price bubble. In that case, GBTC's price would rise  (perhaps significantly) and retain its premium. Finally, if BTCs price rises as high as many of us believe GBTC will likely outperform any other asset you may have in your portfolio over the long term. So while GBTC is overpriced compared to simply holding BTCs it remains one of the few ways of betting on BTC with money tied up in a retirement account. Besides, what else are you gonna buy? AAPL? TWTR? ;)

The commercial banks get their actual physical cash from the various Federal Reserve banks. The Federal Reserve banks distribute the cash that the Treasury prints.
*Edit/addition: 
I also found this tidbit in the above link quite interesting:


So the collateral for Federal Reserve Notes (ie cash) are government bonds which are denominated in dollars. Seems like a bit of a vicious circle no? Until you get to the gold certificate part which are also named as collateral. Gold certificates which represent actual claims to physical gold. In other words, if there is ever some type of loss of faith in the currency, gold will likely be a big part of the new system.

While I agree with the gist of your argument I think it's important to emphasize that nothing you said negates the possibility or even the probability of Bitcoin becoming the world's store of value in the long term. Usability is currently an issue but it is much better than it was a few years ago with the advent of HW wallets. I expect this positive trend to continue.  It is us risk-tolerant early adopters who have suffered the losses and will reap the most benefits while latecomers benefit by learning from our mistakes. Bitcoin banks or depositories will help these less risk-tolerant individuals securely store and transact their coins. Overall, usability can slow adoption but it won't stop it. IMHO.

I love Satoshi's idea too and believe Bitcoin as both a store of value and medium of exchange is the ultimate goal **in the long term.** It is all a matter of timing though. My main concerns primarily center around the **current** real and/or potential external threats, and the possible increased vulnerability to those threats should Bitcoin attempt to scale too quickly with associated increases in mining and node centralization. I think the right time to scale is when a large proportion of the world's wealth is saved in bitcoins. It may seem as if that proposition could take decades but we may be surprised at the speed of adoption especially in the face of another national or global financial 'event'.

The bottom line is that Keynesian's (and therefore neoclassicals if they embrace 'Keynesian macro') believe in the need for centralized control and decision making to best guide the economy, and that government knows what's best for individuals, while Austrians believe in distributed laissez-faire capitalism and supports the idea of individual liberty.

Firstly, deflationary currencies would improve the standard of living of the poorest amongst us by lowering prices for essential goods and services. By saving their money the poor would no longer be subject to the inflation tax as they are now. Secondly, deflationary currencies don't stifle investment. People can still choose to invest in whatever they wish however the potential returns on those investments should be greater than the economy's productivity gains. This would lead to more market-driven, prudent levels of investment.  As it stands now, the so called risk-free return investment is government bonds. People earn interest for lending their money to a centralized group of people who use those funds to support projects that are greatly influenced by all sorts of back room deals, graft, and corruption. Bitcoin would move investment decisions away from centralized actors with hidden agendas to rational individuals.

Here's my math using [this world bank data]( as a resource)
Global Reserves (includes gold) = 12.52 trillion
Sixth largest reserve currency = Canadian Dollar at ~2% according to [Wikipedia](
So 12.52 trillion * 2% = 250$ billion
250 billion $/21 million coins = **11900$/coin**
I was wrong your estimate was actually too high compared to mine.
*Made additional calculation edits.

There is no problem with deficit spending but there are problems with persistent deficit spending which is unsustainable. Persistent unsustainable deficit spending is only possible with fiat currencies because they are not physically constrained (scarce) and eventually leads to loss of faith in those currencies and resultant hyperinflation.

TL;DW 
M-Pesa is great and has lead to marked improvement in the lives of Kenyans. No mention of Bitcoin or the fact that while M-Pesa is a great advancement in money transfer it is not an innovation of money itself.
The head of Safaricom (M-Pesa) was subtly mocking the banks lobbying efforts to prevent M-Pesa from entering their market. He went on to praise the government's openness to M-Pesa and other disruptive technologies like AirBnB and Uber. How likely is it that he would do the exact same thing as those same banks if BitPesa started to gain traction in Kenya? 
My guess is about 100% likely.

@_date: 2015-11-12 04:01:47
I think what I was confused about was the comparison of BTC to cash, in that cash's purchasing power can be inflated away very easily while BTC and gold's cannot. In a future world devoid of COMEX paper contracts, (thought by some to be suppressing the real value of gold and allowing it to function as the premier S.O.V.) gold would be the item that most people would choose to hold and not cash. I hope that bitcoins will also play this S.O.V. role in the future as well.

Mayer hits it out of the park in that interview with Buitink which is not surprising as he is a follower of the Austrian school and understands what real money is. It is this foresight and knowledge which enabled Mayer and other techno-libertarians to become the earliest Bitcoin adopters. Similarly, Jaime Dimon understands what real money is which allows him to recognize the threat that Bitcoin poses to the current issuers of currency and predict what their reaction to it will be. Bitcoin is monetary sovereignty which is what this world desperately needs despite the vast majority of people not being able to recognize that fact. Currently monetary sovereignty is being manifested in items like physical gold, fine art, vintage automobiles, and Vancouver real estate.  If developers like are able to improve the properties of Bitcoin which enable monetary sovereignty (eg. through confidential transactions) then the value proposition of Bitcoin will increase tremendously and the world will be a much better place.

I **think** he gets it as well but when he doesn't explicitly come out and endorse bitcoins as a reasonable investment and opens with "the greater fool theory" then it brings his understanding of Bitcoin into question. Maybe he is one of these "protocol-good currency-bad" people. If you can articulate the value of the protocol you should have no reservations recommending the token. If your audience is incapable of understanding a well reasoned thoughtful analysis and think of you as a pumper then it's their problem. I have more respect for individuals with conviction and reasonable analysis than intellectual fence sitters. 
So I just Googled Brad T. and come to find that he was once the Chairman of the EFF.

You seem to be thinking too much in USD terms. Sure at today's prices a few bitcoins is a drop in the ocean but bitcoins and gold may be all that matters after a hyperinflationary crisis. The object would be for the Feds to obtain a significant amount of bitcoins; let's say several hundred thousand at least. Their current value or their future value priced in dollars is immaterial. I'd think of it as an insurance policy against hyperinflation much like central banks hold gold. 


They would have to try harder because the network hash rate would be far greater than it is now. It would be more worthwhile to figure out ways to steal bitcoins than to try and break the Bitcoin protocol. I think Satoshi designed the incentive structure of Bitcoin with this type of attack in mind.

I believe that Bitcoin's demand should not be measure by the number of users or transactions on the network but rather by the amount of value transferred over the network. Hypothetically, if there are only 2 users on the network who are transferring tens of billions of dollars worth of value on-chain per day, and paying miners for that privilege, Bitcoin is much more likely to survive than if millions of users are using bitcoin to play Satoshi Dice and paying de-minimus fees.

For people who want to use their retirement account funds to track the price of BTC there is no easier way to do so than to buy GBTC. Compared to the performance of other investment alternatives GBTC has done exceptionally well but is relatively volatile.

Interesting problem. Here are some random thoughts.
As an analogy what if I had a bunch of cash or gold? Could I use that as collateral? How would the bank know that a buddy of mine simply didn't lend it to me for the day? Maybe you'd have to transfer some of your coins to a trusted 3rd party like Coinbase and use their Vault product. I wouldn't lend you money unless I was sure that those coins were actually under your control. Showing them a few private keys is not likely to cut it. Good luck though.

So I guess my issue with MMT is partly philosophical and partly economic. It seems that ultimately MMT is dependent on coersion/force to work. As Mosler said in the debate with Murphy, if you remove the bouncer then Mosler's tickets lose all their value. No one would want or need them. Sure the system of a monopolist issuing the currency can work for some time but do we really want to continue to live in that kind of world? Are a small group of central bankers really wise enough to know the right amount of money needed by an economy at any given moment. How is that world any different from the central planning of the former Soviet Union?
From an economic point of view I thought that there was a very astute question from one of the attendees at about 1hr 20min. He made the observation that what is really changed when money is put into or taken out of the economy is the distribution of the money which alters past contracts. For example, when money is put into the system debtors benefit, and when money is taken out savers benefit. I think this situation causes a lot of confusion and unintended consequences in the economy and I don't think that Mosler answered the question of distribution alteration adequately; he simply rehashed what gives his cards value.
Also, hypothetically if Bitcoin adoption became more widespread how would governments maintain the value of their currencies? I understand that fiat currencies are required for payment of taxes but couldn't one simply exchange enough bitcoins for dollars for tax payment? Governments can't require the use of dollars for all economic activity? If governments continue to expand the money supply won't the relatively deflationary bitcoins continue to gain in value in the long term? If bitcoins do continue to gain in value and can be used as a medium of exchange where would the demand for dollars come from other than to pay taxes? The only solution would be for the government to restrict the supply of dollars much like they had to under the gold standard which would bring their budgets under control. Bitcoin would end up keeping governments honest. 
Sorry, I know it's a bit rambling of a response.

Satoshi modeled Bitcoin after gold. In fact, [here is the link where he discusses that]( in the context of Mises regression theorem.

@_date: 2015-11-12 14:33:12
I like to think of the Bitcoin network as the foundation of truth for the monetary system much like gold was in the past. This foundation is possible because bitcoins are a scarce commodity which can't be created at will like fiat currencies are. As long as one can refer back to that Bitcoin foundation, via proof of reserves for example, then the system will function efficiently and be able to scale off-chain. As it stands now, countries issue their own money, and the decision making of how to spend that money is more centrally determined relative to a monetary system tied to a scarce money like gold or BTC.
For example, a bank or country can issue its own off-chain currency and relatively easily prove that it has the bitcoins to 'back' that currency at a certain exchange rate. If all of a sudden that country were to print more money their off-chain currency to btc exchange rate would worsen and the interest rates on their sovereign debt would rise. An increase in the interest rates would require governments to be more fiscally responsible and force them to make tough budget decisions.

What has worked for me is focusing on what Bitcoin **'is'** and staying away from all the **'how it does it'** type of explanations. The analogies don't have to be perfect. Usually the more astute listeners will start asking 'how?' questions but I don't get too deep into those explanations otherwise you end up going down the whole blockchain-node-mining road and they lose interest. Use the **'KISS'** (Keep it simple stupid) principle with your explanations.
So I'll say stuff like:
Bitcoin is like digital cash. 
I can send you a bitcoin like I send an email. 
I can't copy a bitcoin like a digital file or picture.
If I lose the password (key) then the bitcoin is lost forever. 
There will only be 21 million but they're divisible into a lot of units like dollars and pennies for example. 
They can be bought like any other currency (show them a screenshot of Bitfinex). 
The price fluctuates a lot because it's a small market.

I disagree that more users are needed to grow the ecosystem. Bitcoin is a value transfer network. The ecosystem "grows" based on the **amount of value** transferred over it not the numbers of users directly exchanging on it.
In addition, the author assumes that everyone will need to eventually settle on the network. I don't believe this is accurate. Most individuals may end up having bitcoin denominated accounts at financial institutions (or use a system like Open Transactions). It would be these financial institutions which eventually settle on-chain; in a process akin to banks transferring gold bullion between themselves while their depositors used paper gold certificates as a medium of exchange.

The gold standard doesn't work because it is essentially a form of price fixing. When the dollar was exchangeable at a fixed rate of 35$ per oz. for example there was a run on physical gold as the US increased its money supply. This gold shortage was the reason for the Nixon shock in 1971.
A more reasonable system would be one where the price of gold, more specifically physical gold, is allowed to float relative to the amount of fiat currency. Some people believe that this situation is inevitable, has been dramatically hastened by the recent actions of central banks, and when it does occur the price of gold will be revalued significantly higher. It is postulated that this gold revaluation will allow gold to resume its role as a store of value replacing the current store of value, government bonds. I have found this blog helpful in understanding our current monetary system and the role that gold may play in the future (hopefully with a little help from BTC).

I believe that he is right that governments will try to make Bitcoin illegal. A lot of people here have been predicting this for quite some time; especially those who understand the threat that bitcoin poses to the current monetary and financial systems. What I believe he is wrong about is when he says: "There will be no real non-controlled currency in the world. There's no government that's going to put up with it for long." Now I'm not sure what exactly he means by 'real' but to assume that governments can eliminate the usage of Bitcoin worldwide by making it illegal is the ultimate in both hubris and ignorance. Drugs are illegal, file sharing of copyrighted material is illegal, exchanging Venezuelan bolivars for dollars on the black market is illegal yet all of these activities occur. The world's governments are unlikely to come together in some type of kumbaya moment and co-ordinate a global Bitcoin ban. There is likely to be a quiet revolution where people see their government issued currency losing value and they turn to bitcoin as a safe haven asset where they can store their wealth. Even some failing governments may purchase bitcoins as a reserve asset as a last gasp effort to save themselves. It may take years or decades but I think it will happen.

Full quote:




Ethically, if a group of people don't agree with others it is within their rights to pursue their own self-interests. Bitcoin was created by Satoshi because he disagreed with the current global monetary system and decided to 'exit' with the hopes that Bitcoin would supplant fiat currency. If btcdrak contends that hard forkers are unethical shouldn't he apply the same reasoning to Satoshi and himself? 






By definition, contentious hard forks don't require consensus. Those who want to hard fork are within their rights to do so. This is not a democratic process. Hard forkers are not beholden to Core or any other Bitcoin users; they have no responsibility to guarantee the long term value of your or my funds, only their own. Hard forkers only responsibility is to pursue their own self-interests.  
Btcdrak seems deathly afraid of any contentious hard fork yet it is certain that eventually there will be irreconcilable differences and therefore contentious hard forks will be inevitable. The market will subsequently decide the value of each chain. If BTC can't survive hard forks it is not "robust".  On the contrary, I am confident that when faced with adversity BTC will overcome it and become stronger. BTC is not only robust it is anti-fragile.

Bitcoin enables people to save their wealth in a way which when used properly is easily stored, indestructable, divisible, and which can't be inflated or confiscated.

Another possible scenario; status quo. No scaling solution for years...maybe more. In the interim, there are financial crises and BTC's price continues to rise.

I had a similar experience as you when trying to make sense out of Ethereum but it's way over my head. I'm not a computer science guy or tech geek but I was able to understand the basics of Bitcoin pretty quickly. Ethereum may be great but I still don't understand its value added if the same system can be built on a Bitcoin foundation with sidechains and Rootstock. On the other hand why do we need Rootstock if we have the ability to exchange ethers for bitcoins using Shapeshift.

Because the government is not the law in an AnCap society. There is no **central** authority but there is still authority.

These people took on risk of losing all their money which still may be the case today. If not for them, bitcoins would have no value. There would be no incentive for others to develop infrastructure around the Bitcoin protocol. So yes, these people deserve something. They have nothing to be ashamed of and deserve to be rewarded for their foresight. Sure, some may have stumbled upon Bitcoin and not understood the true potential of the protocol but I suspect that the vast majority of these "weak hands" sold long ago and aren't as wealthy as you imagine. The fact is that if Bitcoin reaches its full potential anyone here can buy a bitcoin today and find themselves in similar shoes to those early adopters.

My main question to you is this:
Does the item society uses as money need to have "intrinsic value"?
Gold for example is currently trading at around 1200 USD per oz. Almost all of that price reflects its use as a form of money/store of value. Very little of that price is related to its "intrinsic value" as a pretty yellow metal which is also a good conductor of electricity. The characteristics that make gold a good form of money are improved upon by bitcoins. 
So, if gold's "intrinsic value" is not necessary for it to serve as money why must we expect bitcoins to have "intrinsic value" to serve as money?
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:24:36
If increased centralization were becoming an issue and was reflected in a lower BTC price I'm certain that Bitmain and other miners would make adjustments to reverse the process. Bitmain has an incentive to keep their customers happy otherwise their profits will fall.  
Also, it's difficult to define centralization. If there were only 100 nodes being run in huge data centers but were geographically distributed and in different jurisdictions would you be confident that Bitcoin was still immutable?  
Everyone knows that a centralized Bitcoin is useless and therefore everyone is incentivized not to let that happen.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:57:05
What's arrogant about my statement? People who bought bitcoins took on risks that they would lose all of their money. In fact, that is still the case. Bitcoin could still fail.
Compare that situation to many of the 1%ers of today especially those involved in the financial industry who make up the majority of that category. The fact is that the fiat system allows these bankers to create credit out of thin air and charge interest. Should these loans go bad they are bailed out with taxpayer money. These one percenters are the ones taking no risk.
My comment is not arrogant, it's about the facts of how our current system operates and how a bitcoin based system will be far more just.

Bass laughs and asks if “its a trick question” as if it is something they have both talked about. Bass goes on to say that his firm has a new focus that he finds captivating and that they will talk about in around 6 months. 
Keep in mind that Bass is a very intelligent investor who is an independent thinker and made a killing in the subprime mortgage crisis by betting against conventional wisdom. Also, Bass is somewhat of a hard money/gold advocate (see here  and here

I'm not so sure this is certain. If there were a huge price increase I'd guess that most new users would buy coins through Coinbase or Circle. I also suspect that as the blocks get filled we'd see an increase in the average number of bitcoins transacted per block along with higher fees. I don't think 1mb blocks will lead to any disaster but it will shift Bitcoin towards being used for higher value on-chain transactions.

I agree in general but there is no succinct way to convey the actual mechanics behind a voluntary society without government setting the laws.

Money is the first and most important domino to fall which will end up transforming society.

This end-game can only be achieved by taking control of money away from central banks and governments. Once you do this everything else falls into place.

OK back to another lengthy blog post by the author known as FOFOA. Here he discusses why he believes MMT is not a sustainable system. 
Hit Ctrl-F and search for the following which can be found in the comments section (you may have to open a link): 
Hello Greg, I am going to take issue with statement as well:
"QE is NOT adding new money for the Treasury to spend it is a simple asset swap." 
I think his arguments make a lot of sense. You may have heard these critiques before and disagreed with them which is fine or perhaps you haven'y and they will make you rethink your position.
For me the criticism of MMT that resonates the most is when FOFOA explains:
"But where your theory really goes wrong is viewing "money" and government spending as the engine of the economy. Money is only a lubricant for the real economic engine, which is private production. The government doesn't produce anything. All it does is mess with free market private production, sending capital here and there in a big tangled mess of system-wide malinvestment."
I don't believe that I will ever be convinced by the MMT argument that it is money and not production that drives an economy.

A reading of the documents released by both the Central Bank of Italy and the FIU indicates that a business that transacts in virtual currencies is not subject to any regulation at this time. However, the owners of such businesses would be subject to existing AML/KYC requirements when setting up a bank account or dealing with a regulated financial institution. In that case, virtual currency activities are not subject to any unique regulations; instead the activities are regulated where they intersect with the existing AML requirements of the Italian financial system.
Italy is the first country to declare that virtual currency exchanges are not subject to any AML requirements. This is in contrast to the United States, where exchanges are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as Money Services Businesses.
This is confusing to me. It seems that since regulations do in fact apply at "intersection points" that all virtual currency exchanges will be required to follow these AML/KYC regulations contrary to what the article suggests.
Unless they mean the exchanges that are crypto only, without fiat, which would be impossible to regulate anyways.

Ultimately these limits will be set by the mining fees. As fees move up it will make less sense to use on chain transaction for small values. If the fee for example is 5 cents then it doesn't really make sense to use Bitcoin for transactions where you are sending value around that amount.

Also, as someone mentioned above the block reward can remain in place if there is a resolution to increase the number of decimal places from the current 8.

I don't really think 'democracy' is the right term. If it were a 'democracy' we would all vote on the issues and then follow the path selected by the majority. In Bitcoin's case there are 2 paths and the more robust path succeeds. I find it more akin to evolution or survival of the fittest.

I think the government is really inefficient at allocating resources with a ton of waste and corruption. I also believe that the vast majority of people are kind and would be willing to help their fellow man. I believe that we can offer a more robust efficient and voluntary support structure through charities as opposed to taxation. 


I think that this is a possibility and even occurs today with government agencies but there would almost certainly be free market solutions. One solution is that if the other defense firms suspected that Dawn Defense was tampering with evidence they would contract out with private investigators. Once they had gathered enough evidence they could take Dawn Defense to court. This is a far more palatable situation to what we have now where it is near impossible to take corrupt government agents to court.

The tulip bubble burst and never recovered. Bitcoin has had multiple bubbles since 2009 with each baseline price after the bursting being higher than the baseline price before the bubble. This is a significant difference. Bubbles based on Ponzi type schemes or manias form once and never recover after the bursting. Although there are similarities in the appearance of the tulip and Bitcoin manias I believe we are witnessing the adoption of a new technology. Time will tell.

They can steadily buy a couple of thousand bitcoins a day over the next few months. Sure it would drive the price up several hundreds or thousands of dollars; but so what, it would still be a relatively small market compared to fiat currency forex markets. I don't see how that would destabilize the Bitcoin market other than driving the price higher.

There are a ton of sites out there trying to scare people into understanding the monetary system and how it enslaves them but truth be told I don't think fear is the best way to achieve that educational goal. A lot of gold and silver advocates make these types of videos with the eerie background music which I believe come across as amateurish and scammy. There are better teachers in the space like Ron Paul, Mike Maloney and Peter Schiff but it seems that they are having relatively little success reaching a broader audience. Also, there is so much inertia that I don't believe most people will be convinced to give up on the current monetary system through fear tactics.
OTOH Bitcoin, by leveraging people's greed and envy, can be a terrific tool to move masses of people out of the current system and achieve a network effect into hard money without even necessarily having to educate people about the monetary system. Imagine how powerful a Bitcoin exchange rate of 1000$, 5000$, 10000$ (ahhh the beauty of a small 'market cap') will be in getting people to switch over into the hard money camp. People won't even know why they will be exiting the system; they'll simply see a small group of people becoming rich and will want to get in on the action by dumping their fiat and saving in BTC (and gold too). Also, considering the exchange rate has gone from pennies to hundreds of dollars, it seems to me that it's already happening. Starting with the most knowledgeable people who understand money and tech, and working its way outwards to VCs and financial types, BTC adoption will end with the arrival of the general public as passive followers. It will happen. It's only a matter of time. Hopefully sooner rather than later.

Jaime Dimon is smart enough to understand the current monetary system and the vital role that fiat currencies play in sustaining centralized institutions. Unfortunately for him he is not smart enough to understand that governments can't stop Bitcoin. Yes, they can slow it down but in the long run Bitcoin adoption will win because it is the better money. Dimon's comments may have a huge Streisand effect especially if the mainstream media follows up and asks him to elaborate on his comments.

Although it's decided by the 'market rate' more importantly it's not decided by a 'free market rate'.

Without perfect fungibility/privacy there is always a level of fear of government. That the state might punish me for using my money in a way in which they do not approve. My needs are subservient to theirs and my 'monetary voice' is quieted or even silenced. Without fungibility/privacy I lack monetary freedom and am incapable of having true freedom of expression. Multiplied across the population this loss of freedom results in self-censorship and a hindrance of cross-pollination of ideas that help move society forward.

I expect the mining industry as a whole to have the exact same problems they had with the first halving - none.
For the better part of the past 1.5 years the price has ranged between 250 and 450$ with a concomitant increase of the network hash rate by about 500%. It's probable that the jump in prices since May of this year are more than enough to mitigate the downsides of the halving.

Countries used to back their currency with gold which is a physical asset with limited supply.

If dollars were made more divisible tomorrow that effect would be distributed evenly to all current dollar holders. Whereas in the past they had 100 pennies to spend they now have 1000 or 10000 or whatever units to spend. The overall relative distribution of the money does not change and neither would prices.  
If on the other hand the money supply were increased by the central bank that new money has to get into the economy and be distributed in some way. It does so in an uneven way with those who first acquire the new money being at a relative advantage in their ability to purchase goods and services as prices haven't adjusted upwards yet. Those who get the money first benefit at the expense of those who receive the money last as it works its way through the economy.  
Therefore the effects of making a money more divisible versus increasing the money supply are very different in terms of who benefits, who suffers, and what happens to prices overall.

Not quite. In the US, the Fed Reserve bought billions of mortgage backed securities and government bonds. The purchase of mortgages kept property values artificially elevated benefitting the owners at the expense of real estate buyers. The purchase of government bonds enabled continued government largesse which absent the QE program would have had to scale back its spending. QE also artificially kept interest rates lower than they would have otherwise been. The beneficiaries of QE were speculators and debtors, both rich and poor debtors, while those who suffer the most were the savers.

What's wrong with off chain transactions to address blockchain bloat? I would have no problem depositing bitcoins in a bank whose deposits could be audited by looking at the blockchain. 
We have had an analagous banking system in the past that was backed by gold with the issuance of gold paper notes. In that system, the physical gold was the blockchain and the paper notes were the off chain transactions. The problem with gold is that transferring of bars between banks is expensive and auditing of the bars in the vaults is a very time consuming. 
While this whole auditing process with gold is opaque to the public and requires trust in bankers, with bitcoins the process is completely transparent, and with this transparency arises confidence in not only the banks but the money itself.

I don't think there is anyway one can explain the technical details of how Bitcoin works to a non technical person.
However, you can draw the analogy that bitcoin mining is similar to gold mining in that new bitcoins are discovered and not created. Maybe show him [this graph]( and explain that the rate of bitcoin discovery and the total supply of bitcoins is predetermined. Explain that the whole mining aspect is meant to mirror gold and prevent inflation like they had in the Wiemar Republic.
For peer-to-peer I would explain how the blockchain is like a giant public ledger that everyone has access to. There is no central authority who can abuse the system. Maybe show him some [live transactions] ( or some [random transaction] ( he can see for himself. 
Hope this helps. Good luck.

If something will benefit you you should support it.  Bitcoin is not a zero sum game. One person's gain is not your loss.  Bitcoin will create a fairer society compared to the one we have now because unlike fiat it can't be created without limit by a select few. With this non-fiat system I expect there to be less overall wealth inequality as the current hodlers eventually spend their bitcoins.

Bitmessage is a p2p messaging (and broadcast / subscription) protocol, based on the Bitcoin protocol.
It uses its own blockchain, but the chain only stores the last 2 or 3 days worth of messages. (It's assumed they were delivered within that time, where they are then safely stored on the recipient's inbox.)
Combining the above Bitmessage capabilities--which we already proved out experimentally--with Open-Transactions, makes possible **fully-decentralized p2p markets**, as well as p2p escrow across OT federated servers, easy p2p and server-to-server wiring of funds and conversion of currencies, both within OT and also between OT and the conventional banking system.

The FED is already cornered. I don't see how there is a way out of this mess. Just the hint of tapering QE earlier this spring caused the yields on the 10yr UST to rise to 3%. If they do actually taper what will yields rise to? What percent of the tax revenues will then be needed for pay the interest on the $17 trillion debt? Essentially the FED is waiting for a miracle from Congress in terms of fiscal policy while at the same time the FED enables the politicians to spend more as they see interest rates at historical lows. This crisis will end not from changes made from within the US but rather from a loss of faith in the US dollar by the rest of the world. It will happen slowly then all at once.

They won't stop mining but that mining after the year 2140 will not have block rewards. The incentive to mine will come from transaction fees which will be done with existing coins. No new coins will be generated. Hence the cap of 21 million. Increasing the number of decimal places will not increase the number of coins it will increase the number of units that able to be traded.

The Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises distinguished between 'use value' and 'exchange value'. Gold's value arises predominantly from its exchange value ie. It became money because it could be exchanged for items with use value like a plow or livestock. 
The question is, what gives gold it's exchange value? The answer lies in its fundamental properties of divisibility, fungibility, portability, durability,  and scarcity. Over thousands of years, and because of these characteristics, free market forces determined that gold and silver were the commodities best suited for the role of money. Although our current  US Dollars share many of these characteristics they lack that of scarcity. Because humans are fallible and because printing money is often the most politically convenient means of fulfilling government promises the supply of dollars has skyrocketed over the decades. This increase in supply is the reason why prices have increased and the dollar has lost over ninety percent of its purchasing power since the creation of the Federal Reserve. The past several years has seen an even greater degree of money printing euphemistically disguised as "quantitative easing".
So, what "backs" bitcoins. Although lacking physicality, I would argue that what "backs" bitcoins are the same fundamental properties that "back" gold. Bitcoins like gold are divisible, fungible, portable, durable and scarce even though these properties exist in the electronic/virtual as opposed to physical/tangible realm.

Credit cards aren't good for **selling** bitcoins.
If you sent your bitcoins to someone in exchange for a credit card payment the person who bought your bitcoins could claim that they never received them and the credit card company would cancel (chargeback) the transaction. The bitcoin seller would therefore not receive his cash and his bitcoins would be gone.

Upon further reading, I found it interesting that each individual transaction is first hashed and then a block of these transaction hashes is hashed to get a "merkle root".

I agree that selling might be the right move for some people who really need fiat now but I don't agree with:  "recognize what this is -- a reflexive bubble being driven by hot money speculation in a small market wthe price of bitcoin, and not "adoption" -- and sell some now with the intention of buying back at some point after the crash."
If it is a bubble:
Does it rise to $200 and crash to $90? or
Does it rise to $10000 and crash to $7500? or
Maybe it's not a bubble at all and it rises until it finds its true value and plateaus.
I have no idea what the price will do. I'm also cognizant of the fact that past stock/asset bubbles may not be applicable/predictive to Bitcoin as we are talking about a new form of money after all.

The smartest traditional bankers probably understand that nimble fintechs that use Bitcoin are at a competitive advantage.

They've been laughed to scorn by left and right wing economists, caricatured as the perpetrators (or victims, take your pick) of a global Pyramid scheme, written off, ridiculed, and all-around snobbed to death by Wall Street.
Yet, for all the articles that have appeared in the mainstream media, comparatively few have actually engaged the Bitcoin community itself in the conversation. I believe that's a mistake. What I've discovered over the past 5 days or so I've spent on is not a basket of naive, ideologically fueled freshmen that detractors like Gideon Samid airily dismiss as "The Bitcoin Delusion", but a diffuse, sophisticated and above all ambitious sub-culture that is capable -through raw programming prowess, if nothing else - of changing the way people think about money. This is not some pseudoeconomic post-modern Libertarian cult, it's an un-led, crowd-sourced mega startup organized around mutual self-interest where problems, whether of the theoretical or purely practical variety, are treated as temporary and, ultimately, solvable.
In fact, it is this ability to layer solutions over Bitcoin's existing framework and hack around inconveniences is the reason why Bitcoin won't just crawl up and die, despite five boom/bust cycles, the fall of Silk Road's "Dread Pirate Roberts", the jeers of heavyweight economic influencers like Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman and Euro Pacific Capital's Peter Schiff, and the outright skepticism of Wall Street in general.
Bitcoin started it's pseudoanonymous life as a pet programming project: a protocol designed by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the supporting infrastructure is relatively complex, in practice, Bitcoin operates like cash with a caveat: No one can bring more that 21 million coins into being, while the coins that do exist are near infinitely sub-divisible.

Or they could match a fraction of the coins. The lower the fraction the lower the fees. If the fraction were low enough I suspect that interest on deposits would be feasible. Different depositors would have different risk tolerances and therefore choose the product that served them best.
The banks could have a collective pool of coins and insure each other if they wanted. 
I believe this type of banking system would also allow for off chain transactions as coinbase does for their customers thereby reducing the stress on the blockchain.

First create an offline cold storage wallet on a computer not connected to the internet. After creating the offline wallet there will then be an option to create a corresponding watching only wallet that you can save to a USB and transfer to a different computer which is connected to the internet. This internet connected computer must have BitcoinQt running so that the Armory watching only wallet can check it for your bitcoin balance and broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network. 
In order to spend any bitcoins you first create the transaction on the watching only online wallet. This transaction is saved on a USB and physically transferred to the offline cold storage wallet whose purpose is to sign the transaction. Once the transaction is signed it is saved on the USB and physically transferred back to the online watching only wallet where it can be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
Alan Reiner, the creator of Armory, has a great website that walks you through the process. Try it out a few times until you are comfortable. It's not that difficult. Also, I would only use Armory for coins that you can't afford to lose. If you only have a small amount of coins it's not worth the hassle of keeping BitcoinQt up to date. Something like Electrum is probably a better option.

When Bernanke came out and said that Bitcoin has some positive attributes some in our community saw that as an endorsement. Make no mistake, when Bitcoin starts to gain significant adoption there will be a confrontation between the fiat and hard money camps.

I can envision 3 possible scenarios coming out of the government deliberations:
1) They fully endorse bitcoin, understand its advantages for consumers, and encourage entrepreneurs to build out the ecosystem provided that AML/KYC regulations are followed. Likelihood 1%. BTC To da moon!
2)They issue some wishy washy statements and kick the can down the road explaining that they need additional time to study x,y, and z. In the meantime, all AML/KYC regs must be followed and in addition consumer protection measures be added. Likelihood 98%. BTC falls in the short term but continues appreciating in value at its current pace with occasional superimposed bubbles.
3)Full on assault of bitcoin with plan to ban usage by retailers in US. Propaganda as to how it is used to launder money, avoid taxes buy drugs blah blah blah. Likelihood 1%. Bitcoin falls in short term. Development slows in short term but subsequently moves to friendlier countries and BTC continues its current trajectory.
In summary, I believe that the government regs can only effect the adoption and price of BTC in the short term but have none in the long term. Also, I believe its more likely that we'll see a short term fall in the exchange rate following the recommendations. Keep in mind that those recommendations may come out when BTC's price is far higher that 200$.

So, let me get this straight, the former head of the Federal Reserve, the bank of banks, does not understand the very essence of money?! I could believe this if it came from someone like Bernanke or Yellen but keep in mind that before he was head of the Fed, Greenspan wrote about the [merits of gold] ( aka "analog bitcoins".
So how do we square this circle? 
I see two possibilities:
1. He has become senile with extensive deposition of plaques and tangles within his cerebral hemispheres.
2. He is lying and completely understands the significance of Bitcoin and the threat it poses to the US dollar as the global reserve currency!

Although guys like ryancarnated seem like tin-foil hat types with their analyses of the US economy they are probably closer to the truth than most. It is probably very true that in the long term Bitcoin has a better chance of success than any fiat currency including the US dollar. 
The fiscal and monetary situation in the US is crazy. They are nearly 17 million million (aka trillion) in debt and the Fed is printing (ie. devaluing) 85,000 million dollars per month to buy bonds and mortgages. If this "quantitative easing" continues the dollar will eventually lose all its purchasing power.
On the other hand, if the Fed stops buying US bonds the interest rates will spike up and, depending on how high those rates go , the majority of tax revenues could be consumed by the interest payments on the debt. There will be much less money for everything else (social security, medicare, the military, unemployment insurance etc). The entire US could resemble Detroit with a very unhappy populace. Taxes would have to increase significantly to pay for entitlements which would lead to capital flight to other countries. This would lead to a revenue death spiral exactly like Motown's.
Of course, theoretically politicians could decide to reduce the size of government but I have seen absolutely no indication whatsoever that this will happen. Heck, last year it was as if the world was coming to an end and they couldn't even agree to cut 0.1 trillion/yr from the budget for 10 years. As a betting man, I believe that the current deficit spending will continue until there is a crisis forcing change. It is just human nature. It's politically too difficult to do otherwise.

Online poker had to interact with the traditional banking system and the fiat currencies. Although adoption of Bitcoin would be more rapid with currency exchanges they aren't absolutely necessary. Also, Bitcoin is a distributed network with no single point of attack much like Bittorrent which has also eluded government regulation. In addition, the existence of a web site like Silk Road suggests that government regulations have limits. Also, bitcoins may actually allow online poker to flourish. Although Bitcoin may fail I believe it is far more difficult to control than online poker.
TLDR-online poker guys may need to prepare themselves to feel extreme levels of jealousy and gratification.

Interviewer asks: "What is Bitcoin?"
JLE answers: "Bitcoin is not literally a coin. It is a 32 alphanumeric set of numbers and letters and what you need is a digital wallet."
This is not a good explanation for most non technical savvy people. 
I would have answered the question something like this:
"Bitcoin is a currency similar to US dollars but without a physical form. You can check your balance like you do with your online bank account at Bank of America. In order to spend or receive bitcoins you need a digital wallet which contains keys that grant you access to those online coins."
You can then transition to the whole fiat vs. gold/bitcoin conversation, tell people how easy it is to download a wallet or use an online wallet service, explain how wallets contains addresses, post addresses on websites for microtransactions, etc etc.
IMHO terms like blockchain, cryptocurrency, hashing, and mining should never be used when introducing newbies to BTC. Their eyes will glaze over and they will lose interest within seconds.

Looks good but a few questions:

2.When is the launch date?
3.Is the government of Cyprus supportive of Bitcoin? I saw Max Keiser's interview with the CFO of Nicosia U. who alluded to the fact that the government seemed open to the idea but I didn't hear anything concrete. 
4.What is the ECB's position? (This may be less relevant in Cyprus compared to the PBOC's ruling in China given that Cyprus is an independent nation and not bound by the ECB if they want to leave the Euro.)
Overall, I'd love to see Bitcoin "in action" as the primary medium of exchange in countries like Cyprus and Greece. Given their recent economic travails they are both fertile soil and would prove to the rest of the world how effective BTC could be at recapitalizing a country's economy.

If Bitcoin fulfills its function as a store of value it would replace a percentage of the global bond market which according to the BIS are valued at 21.2 trillion USD. Also, it's possible that cryptos make up more than 10% of fiat currency trade in 10 years. No one knows for certain what the final price will be.

Since when is price deflation a bad thing? Do you prefer to pay more for goods and services? I don't. In fact, the more prices fall the more I'll buy! Even if I expect the price of X to fall by 50% over the course of 
the next year I'd buy it today if I really wanted it and if I could afford it.
Also,what's good for an individual is good for the economy as a whole. Hoarding, more commonly referred to as saving, is essential to having a robust economy.
Hoarding does not mean "never spending" it means "spending when you are able and ready to spend". This leads to an economically more responsible individual, and by extension, country. It would dampen the large booms and busts (tech and housing for example) that the US has been experiencing as a result of the Federal Reserve's ridiculously low interest rate policies under both Greenspan and The Bernank. The entire price signalling mechanism necessary for a healthy economy has been screwed up by our central bank and Keynesian ideology. Bitcoin wrests monetary control away from the elite and puts it in the hands of the people. It, along with the internet, has the potential of being the most important advancement of our lifetimes....no exaggeration.

Although we here at r/bitcoin know that they can be used as a medium of exchange using the appropriate channels, it is much more difficult to convince naysayers that it can be done easily and widely.

If the Federal Reserve can't end quantitative easing as some claim then we will have hyperinflation at some point in the future. The country may then have to return to a gold backed currency. Many argue that the US doesn't have anywhere near the amount of gold it claims to have. If this is the case how would the US replenish its gold reserves?   It wouldn't be able to buy gold because the US dollar would have no value. It could nationalize gold mines but it would take years to obtain sufficient reserves. 
Given bitcoin's relatively inexpensive price the US could currently purchase a significant amount as an insurance policy should the dollar lose all its value and then transition to a bitcoin based economy. Who knows, maybe they have already done this. Maybe they are Satoshi!

I believe US dollars will be used more for day to day purchases if BTC's price **continues to rise**. That's not to say that people won't use BTC to buy stuff just that they are less likely to do so than if the price of BTC were to be **stable**. 
BTC may be used more as a store of value like gold as opposed to a medium of exchange. I hope a side benefit of this store of value role will be fewer transactions thereby taking scalability stress off the blockchain.
If BTC finds a stable exchange rate with the USD, then BTC will probably more frequently be used as a medium of exchange.

One critique I have is when spokespeople say that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. I think that this turns a lot of people off as they can't envision an economy functioning with only 21 million dollars. This statement should always be followed by a quick explanation of the greater degree of divisibility of bitcoins compared to dollars, or a mention of 21 quadrillion units etc.

I agree with you but I think we have to separate short term from long term outcomes. In the short term I can see the price falling by 50% or more but in the long term (arbitrarily 5-10 years from now) I see higher prices than the current 220$...no matter what the US does. I also agree that Joe public doesn't give a shit but the people who are capable of understanding the significance of the technology are starting to grasp its import (ie. venture capitalists, silicon valley entrepreneus) and eventually Joe public will follow. For me the fact that Bitcoin has so many benefits to offer is the trump card that will make it successful. Even the strongest governments eventually succumb to the will of the people...although it may take awhile.

Gold today is primarily used as a store of value. Would you argue that it can't act as medium of exchange? It has been driven out of circulation by Gresham's law. 
Gold is backed by its characteristics that make it money namely scarcity, divisibility, fungibility, portability, and durability. Bitcoin is backed by the same characteristics that make gold sound money and therefore I believe it can similarly act as both a store of value and medium of exchange. 
What other "collectible items" can you name that share the same characteristics as gold and cryptocurrencies? I can't think of any, and that's why I believe that Bitcoin is money.
If any distribution model is flawed it's that of fiat currencies. One day your money has purchasing power and the next day the Central Bank decides to create 85 billion more units a month effectively reducing that purchasing power. That's not a system I'm comfortable with.
@_date: 2013-03-03 17:21:51
The most important aspect of Bitcoin for me is that their purchasing power will not diminish over time like it does with currencies like the US dollar, euro or pound. By having bitcoins I am able to protect my money for retirement from the ravages of inflation much in the same way as people who save gold.
The fact that I can use it over the internet, carry all my wealth in my pocket, get cheaper prices on goods and services, potentially benefit form being an early adopter, and protect my anonymity are all bonuses.

The fundamental problem I have with selling bitcoins at this point is that you are essentially selling "good money" for "bad fiat currency".

Unless you really need currency now isn't the end game to replace fiat and use bitcoins for purchases.

There is a huge difference between increase in supply and increase in units through divisibility and this confuses a lot of people.
When governments print money they are increasing the total supply of currency in the system thereby reducing the purchasing power of all the other existing dollars. This causes increased prices.
When the money is made more divisible the total amount of money supply stays the same. Imagine if instead of your dollar being exchangeable for 100 pennies it would be exchangeable for 200 half pennies. The total number of exchangeable units increases by not the money supply.

There can obviously be counterparty risks with BTC but far less than with gold as bitcoins are more easily stored. If gold were to act as a currency it is unlikely that gold coins would circulate. The gold would be stored in banks and it would be paper bills exchangeable for gold that would circulate.  This is not the case for Bitcoin where the actual coins would be used for the transactions. In addition the amount of bitcoins held by banks would be completely transparent through the blockchain. This complete transparency is impossible with gold.
Bitcoin has already faced competition from a host of altcoins and still has over 95% of the market share. Also those coins don't offer any significant advantages over BTC at the moment. Could it happen that one of the alts wins out? Yes, but I find it very unlikely.

Long Ball
What you have to understand about the Bitcoin community is that while riding off into the sunset as indecently rich as possible may be the ultimate goal of Bitcoin enthusiasts, it's not necessarily the immediate goal. In fact, most Bitcoiners don't always cheer sky high prices any more than Warren Buffett does. On the contrary: High prices are something of a calamity for Bitcoin's true believers due to the fact that it makes the currency that much harder to buy.
Yes, some early adopters are hitting the jackpot. But Bitcoiners don't want to just make money. They want to make truly offensive amounts of money and change the world while they're at it.
In the words of one Redditer:
(Click to enlarge)
On balance, the endless "bitcoin millionaires" stories smack more of the kind low-probability/high impact human interest news that always gets airtime and less like a nefarious secret cabal. Yes, there are big fish within the Bitcoin community just like there are in every pond. However, for every miracle, there are at least half a dozen sob stories of early adopters who either gambled their coins away on SatoshiDice, spent them on pizza or left them on a computer that crashed 12 months ago.
An Insider's Perspective
I decided to conduct a virtual interview with Ryan Selkis, a former venture capital associate and current Bitcoin entrepreneur who has filed two patents for technologies that use Bitcoin to disrupt the charitable giving market, in order to get a handle on the some of the current difficulties and opportunities for merchants who might be thinking about taking the plunge into Bitcoin.
K.S. Bitcoin has a number of skeptics, not least in the financial community, many of whom believe that bitcoin is simply another unsecured speculative vehicle. Some analysts argue that the size of the bitcoin-only community doesn't justify the market cap that is being assigned to the technology. Does that change, in your view, if more merchants decide to accept bitcoin?
R.S First of all, let's distinguish between Bitcoin (the protocol) and bitcoin (the currency). You have to keep in mind that bitcoin the currency is both a store of value and a currency. Right now, its utility as a store of value is outpacing its utility as a currency, so you've got what looks like a speculative investment. But I truly believe that it would take a collapse of the underlying Bitcoin protocol (which most computer scientists say is unlikely) to send the currency to zero.
In fact, there very well could be a natural floor to the price because so many big investors are piling in (SecondMarket, Winklevoss twins, China) and buying on the dips. That's because they believe in the long-term applications possible with the Bitcoin protocol. And since there are a finite number of bitcoins that will ever make it into circulation, these speculators are treating their bitcoin much like they would stock options: you can only lose 1x your money in the event of a collapse, but with many thinking the value of bitcoin could be $10k per coin in the not too distant future (that would put its market cap at about 1% of the global USD reserves), that's might be a decent bet.
The expected value is so sky-high for many investors (rationally or not), that merchant adoption probably doesn't need to ramp up immediately for their underlying assumptions to change. However, it would certainly help, not to mention fuel even more speculative investment. As long as there is some incremental progress, and the U.S. government doesn't over-regulate the industry (which looks less likely after this week's Senate hearings), bitcoin's value could keep going up.
Near-term merchant adoption isn't everything, though, because at the end of the day, investors are looking at bitcoin as if they have the opportunity to retroactively buy a portion of the total value of the early internet. I'd argue the "internet of money" comparison is appropriate--with the caveat that the units of ownership might not necessarily be bitcoin in the long-term, but quite possibly some other alt-currency like litecoin.

K.S. Still, one of the biggest objections you hear about Bitcoin is that there are only so many things you can buy with it directly -
R.S. I actually think the bigger issue is getting consumers to spend their bitcoins, which I'll address in a second.
But for merchants, this really is a no-brainer. Companies like BitPay and Coinbase (and likely Circle, soon) are providing tools that help them accept bitcoin in a matter of hours or even minutes. The merchants pay virtually nothing for the services, unless they convert the bitcoin to U.S. dollars, which they can do instantaneously if they don't want to take the currency risk. (i.e. The merchant lists a good's price in USD, a bitcoin consumer pays in bitcoin, and then BitPay instantly charge the appropriate bitcoin based on the current USD exchange rate and converts it for the merchant.) On top of adding 2-3% of pure profit to the merchant vs. credit cards, they don't have to worry about chargebacks and enjoy near-instant settlements, depending on the transaction size.
In fact, some merchants love bitcoin so much, they're taking the 2-3% savings they earn relative to credit cards and keeping it in bitcoin, with the belief that they are playing with house money and that those reserves could appreciate significantly. So far, those merchants have been right.
The biggest hurdle for most merchants might simply be education. For a select few, another hurdle might be the market's illiquidity. For instance, online jewelers will have a tough time instantly converting large bitcoin sales to USD, and you won't see Amazon accepting it anytime soon with its $60 billion in revenue. They would break the market.
Like I said, the real issue is getting consumers to part with their bitcoins. Merchants have downside protection with some of the tools that are out there, but consumers don't have the same "upside" protection. After all, why pay for something with a currency that might appreciate 50% the very next day? This is really anyone's guess.
Here's how I would approach it: Most of the people buying with bitcoin today will be consumers who have hit the jackpot as early adopters. Rather than diversifying by cashing out through an exchange, why not just buy things from merchants, save the extra 1%, and in the process, help demonstrate the utility of the currency to the broader market, so that more speculators get excited and pile in? Some people buying secret (not illicit) gifts will transact in bitcoin. Over 95% of bitcoin users are males, some of them are married or in serious relationships. If you want to buy something discretely, it would be better to do it with bitcoin when your significant other can't check your checking or credit card statements.
How about getting hedge funds (and I am honestly baffled as to why this hasn't happened already) to reduce volatility for more conservative bitcoin users by guaranteeing the value of those users' underlying bitcoin -- almost like a mini-FDIC. Even if one of the big funds threw $25mm to test this out with a subset of users, it could send enormous positive signals to the rest of the community. In the event bitcoin appreciated, maybe the user would reap 80% of gains, and the fund 20%. With a fund backstopping 100% of losses, it seems like there would still be amazing option value for the funds and good peace of mind for the consumers.
Those are just a few simple ideas. The Bitcoin community is going to come up with many, many more.

Hypothetically, let's say you have 2 bitcoins on Day 1 with a US dollar exchange rate of $10/BTC and you buy a pizza for 1 bitcoin (ie. $10). 
Then, imagine over the course of the next month the exchange rate rises to $100/BTC! Assuming the price of the pizza in US dollars stays at 10$ that one BTC you spent the previous month represents $90 of lost purchasing power had you decided to hoard (aka save) that bitcoin.
All in all an increasing exchange rate does lead to a preference of spending of the depreciating currency (US dollars) and saving BTC. In addition, more saving of bitcoins leads to a decrease in the supply of bitcoins available for purchase in the marketplace resulting in a further escalation in their exchange rate!
Eventually, as the exchange rate continues to rise, different people will decide at different times that the time is right to spend their bitcoin savings. This spending will release bitcoins into the marketplace and put downward pressure on the exchange rate until there is equilibrium.
The point is that people must have the freedom to save or spend their bitcoins as they wish so that the free market is able to establish the appropriate exchange rate. There is no need to tell people whether or not to save or spend. We are all in different situations and must make decisions that best fit our own needs.

Your understanding is correct. Since your offline cold storage wallet is not connected to the internet and doesn't have access to BitcoinQt it will not show any balance anyways. It's sole purpose is to allow you to spend your bitcoins because it contains the private keys to those bitcoins. The bitcoins are actually stored on the blockchain but the access to the coins via the private keys is on your offline cold storage wallet. The online wallet shows all of your balance info.
You should also go to your offline wallet and make backups of that wallet onto a USB drive and store those somewhere safe. You can download a program like Truecrypt onto your online computer and transfer it via USB to your offline computer. You will then be able then be able to encrypt the digital backup copy of your offline wallet and save that encrypted offline wallet to a USB. That **ENCRYPTED** offline wallet on the USB can then be uploaded to Dropbox from your online computer. By having the encrypted offline wallet on Dropbox or similar service your coins will always be safe if your house burns down or your offline computer is destroyed. It also gives you access to your coins from anywhere on the planet with internet availability. Truecrypt tutorials can be found on YouTube.

So, what does the development time-line look like, here? Is bitcoin something that both investors and companies should be paying attention to now, or is it still too early?
I think that investors and companies alike should have been looking seriously at Bitcoin (the protocol and the ecosystem) yesterday. Seriously, if you are a VC and you don't at least pick up the phone and call every CTO in your portfolio to evaluate what they think of the potential here, I've got to question why limited partners would trust you with their money. I'm also very long the bitcoin currency, but that is high-risk / high-reward, and not indicative of the real opportunity. I could lose all of my bitcoin and still be bullish on Bitcoin.
I already outlined most of the clear-cut benefits to companies in the last question. One additional benefit is the marketing value many companies are getting out of it, especially companies with young, male, educated, tech savvy (and libertarian) customer bases. Uber just integrated with Paypal, but why not Coinbase while they're at it? Why aren't digital publishers all over this? For the first time ever, it's realistic to effectively collect micro-payments from readers (e.g. $0.25 per article). There's even a company called Bitwall, which won the Bitcoin 2013 hackathon, actually working on exactly that.
(Click to enlarge)
(source: Coinbase)
The most mind-boggling thing is that computer scientists are calling this "the internet of money," the value of the currency is up 50x year over year, and yet some VC firms seem to have written this off as too good to be true or a bubble/mania without any further research. All because of a couple of dips in what is otherwise a logarithmic growth curve. I've talked to friends at two separate brand-name venture capital firms who told me that the firms weren't even aware of Coinbase, much less the other start-ups in the industry. And this after an industry blogger just posted a compelling case for how Coinbase was on track for a billion dollar valuation after just 18 months!
Companies and investors have immense opportunities right now. They should at least be paying attention, if not diving in with both feet.
There are signs that some big very players - individuals, as well as businesses - are beginning to stand up and take notice. The recent U.S. Senate hearings on Bitcoin were described by The Washington Post as "a Bitcoin love-fest." There's the Winklevoss twins and Second Market, of course. As I write this, billionaire Richard Branson is announcing that his space-tour company Virgin Galactic is now accepting bitcoins for a ticket to the stars. And in a recent interview with the Financial Times, eBay (EBAY) president and CEO John Donahoe said that the company was keeping its eye on Bitcoin and that in the months and years to come, digital currency is going to be "a very powerful thing".
The key to that power is what's known as the blockchain. Like the relatively assuming TCP/IP protocol that underpins the Internet, the Bitcoin blockchain is a cornerstone that future layers can be stacked onto. One such innovation involves the use of so-called "colored coins" that effectively transforms Bitcoins into tokens that can theoretically be used to transfer the ownership of any asset class - real estate, stock, automobiles - all for a cost of about $0.05 USD.
Perhaps the real problem lies not in economic theory, but in institutional memory. The consensus view within the financial community at present is that the "Wild West" aspect of Bitcoin commerce will inhibit consumer spending and dissuade merchants from accepting it at all. Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible and have little to no built-in consumer protections. The same was more or less true of eBay fifteen years ago, and yet millions still shopped there anyway for the novelty of the experience. The strong rate of 1998-2005 growth is reflected on the company's balance sheet.

If Bitcoin can be near-instantaneously converted to dollars right at the register via an exchange plug-in like the one offered by Coinbase (along with all applicable sales taxes, of course), then why should retailers care if it's a bubble or whether or not a deflationary currency is economically tenable? After all, the euro could disappear next year.
What the expansion of Bitcoin's user base offers is sales opportunities that are ultimately measurable in dollars today. Those dollars can, in turn, translate to any number of wonderful things, from quarterly earnings beats to higher transaction volumes. One thing is for certain: If digital currency is even remotely successful, the rewards will go to the investors of the companies that were crazy enough to slap a "We Accept Bitcoin!" sticker over the door.

@_date: 2013-01-21 21:57:30
Chris is right. The rate at which bitcoins are created over the course of time is unrelated to the mining power worldwide. The Bitcoin protocol takes the total mining power available into account and adjusts the difficulty level of obtaining new bitcoins accordingly. This difficulty level is adjusted every few weeks (I think that's the time frame).

Volatility is not a problem when the general trend is upward and if one is willing to hold onto their coins for longer than just a few months.

Do the miners hash those initial transactions or is it done by the whole network?
Does it take more time to hash a transaction with hundreds of inputs and outputs compared to one with only one or two? I'm asking about the initial hashing here, not the block or merkle root hash. 
Can miners game the system by selectively choose only the smallest transactions to hash thereby giving them a slight advantage in finding a block reward? I suspect that the miners get hashes of blocks so that this isn't an issue. Thanks.

I think if there was an outright ban the public would wonder why? They would question what threat bitcoin posed to the US. It would tip off more savvy investors and money managers who would begin to understand Bitcoin's significance and begin to seriously question the US dollar's role as a safe haven asset. Just like twitter was used to kindle the Arab Spring perhaps it would hasten the demise of all fiat currencies. Basically, I don't think an outright ban is in the cards because it would expose the weaknesses of the current US/global fiat monetary systems.

I've been thinking about this recently. 
If Bitcoin does fail for some type of technical reason, I can't imagine a big rush into a new cryptocurrency. The trust in all cryptos would have been broken no matter what improvement it promised.
People would say to themselves: "That problem with Bitcoin was unforeseen, what's to prevent a different unforeseen problem occurring with this new crypto? I think I'll stick with gold and its 5000 year history."
For this reason Bitcoin may be the first and last crypto, or alternatively, the hub/foundation through which all other cryptos are exchanged.
TL;DR--Bitcoin is likely here to stay, but if it fails it will be replaced by something other than new cryptocurrency.

It's not about getting your money offshore. It's about getting your money out of the system altogether and under your own control like people have done with precious metals. Bitcoin is another way to do this and I suggest that a portion of one's total wealth be diversified into Bitcoin. What percentage is obviously up to the individual but I would say not more than one is willing to lose. I agree that Bitcoin must build a reputation and still remains a speculative venture however that seems to be changing faster than most people expected. No reward comes without risk. Bitcoin has been worth the risk so far.

In other words, the purchase of a single bitcoin or a fraction of a bitcoin is just as much a state in the future profits of the Bitcoin network as a share of stock is a stake in the future profits of a company. The economic rationale underpinning Bitcoin's steady logarithmic increase (once booms and busts are filtered out) in price is in turn based on Irving Fisher's Quantity Theory of Money, which essentially states that the quantity of money determines the value of money.
Liquidity within the Bitcoin community is supplied not by inflation, but rather through the extraordinary divisibility of a single bitcoin into increasingly smaller fractions. In short, the programmers, merchants and developers surrounding the bitcoin protocol/network are effectively stakeholders with the mind-share to keep the Bitcoin system up and running regardless of currency crashes or regulatory interference, something that Beijing appears to realize even if Washington ultimately decides to take a different tack. (The German government recently classified Bitcoin as "private money", taxable as a financial instrument.)
Part of that probably has something to do with QQ, a Chinese virtual currency that became so popular so quickly that it accounted for up to 13% of the Chinese economy before Beijing could rein it in. While QQ had a single point of failure [i.e. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY)], Bitcoin highly distributed nature does not. This property makes Bitcoin, like the Internet itself, virtually impossible for a single government or collection of governments to turn off.
Readers should keep in mind that deflationary currencies are not in and of themselves an untenable proposition. Most of the Western world was based on similar standards, and commerce abounded for centuries. And Bitcoin's current volatility cuts both ways: When the Bitcoin price vs. fiat currencies is rising, there are few participants that wish to sell. Nevertheless, as the price of bitcoin is allowed to float vs. a basket of currencies, and because both essential commodities like oil and taxes are denominated in these currencies, the ultimate result is a price collapse to simply shake out the weak hands.
Anatomy of a Startup
Perhaps the best analogy for the Bitcoin community is the frenzied start-up activity (and, yes, euphoria and occasional paranoia) that surrounded the emergence of the World Wide Web in the late 90s; a fact that the creator of the Web, Tim Burners-Lee, never hesitates to point out:
        In this sense, Bitcoin is more like the PC or the Internet than a Segway. What's important isn't the technology itself, but the ways the technology can enable third parties to build on it. People forget that early PCs seemed as comically pointless as a Segway and Bitcoin do today. In 1979, the PC was about four years old - about the same age as Bitcoin is today...The Internet was even worse. The Internet's predecessor, the ARPANET, was still intimidatingly complex and impractical a full decade after it was first created...Someone with a limited imagination in 1979 could easily have mocked predictions of an Internet-connected PC in every home. Who wants to go through all that hassle just so they can write BASIC computer programs, play primitive computer games, and send e-mails to other nerds? What happened next was not that ordinary users became more tech-savvy or more tolerant of clunky technology. Rather, a growing community of entrepreneurs and hackers used these open technological platforms to build more user-friendly and powerful applications on top of the PC and Internet platforms.
It's an apt comparison when you consider how weak the case for the Internet was prior to 1994:
    You had to own a PC (around $3,000 at the time for the floor model.)
    You had to spend even more money a modem ($399+ for a 14.4kbps SupraFAXModem 14400), and the software was glitchy and difficult to install.
    There were only a handful of immature companies to buy from.
    There was no way to trust a seller with your credit card...or, indeed, anything.
    It was filled with strangers.
    It could be dangerous.
    There were no portals - "Jerry's guide to the World Wide Web" (quickly renamed Yahoo!) didn't exist yet - and no search engines, movies, or instant messaging.
None of those significant drawbacks stopped or even slowed the pace of adoption.

I don't believe that the US government can cause the exchange rate to fall as low as 2$, maybe 50$. It's a big world and if the US does ban BTC then development will continue and flourish elsewhere with the US falling behind. I don't think this will happen anyways as Silicon Valley is too important to this country.
The only thing that could cause BTC to crash is some unforeseen flaw with the underlying protocol itself. I'm not tech savvy enough to know the exact odds of this but given that it has survived this long is a good sign. Also, if you spend some time over at bitcointalk.org, specifically in the Development and Technical section, you will get a sense of the intelligence, devotion, and diversity of the community that make this thing work. This community will only strengthen as time goes on. I trust these geeks, hackers or whatever you want to call them far more than any central banker!

This current run up still feels like the earlier stages of the bubble to me. This bubble may top out far higher than 200$ and also crash back down to a level above 200$. Who knows? Good luck though.

I suspect that the typical commentor is an older (over 40 year old) heavily invested long time gold bug with limited to zero understanding of Bitcoin. It's sad that most of them don't have an open mind as even a small allocation of their savings to Bitcoin would be extremely profitable if it ever does go mainstream. There is a lot of philisophical overlap among Bitcoiners and ZHers although many fail to realize this.

Although it may be too late for most Cypriots this crisis highlights the importance of having a Bitcoin wallet and establishing an account on an exchange like Mt Gox. By doing this ahead of time one is assured of having an emergency fund that is not capable of being frozen by the government. Everyone should be doing this. It is the paranoid and smart thing to do.

250 seems a bit low. 
The previous bubbles did not crash below their preceding bubble tops iirc (ie. 266 top fell to around 55 while previous bubble top was 35). I wouldn't be surprised if we drop down to around 500 but I'm hoping it's different this time with stronger hands (SecondMarket) in play.

I don't mind people saying the don't think Bitcoins have value but for a journalist to not understand it and make bold statements that it is "malarkey" is inexcusable and unforgivable.
He also compares bitcoins to the Zimbabwe dollar yet they are polar opposites. The Zimbabwe dollar is an example of a currency which lost all its value because if excessive printing while bitcoins are gaining in value in part due to constraints on their supply. His statement is based on looking at a 3 day chart as opposed to a 3 year chart.
Also, that guy who talked about mining is way off the mark. 
Mining is completely impractical for the average Joe.
I mean does anyone who wants to own gold head off to Alaska with a shovel and pan. No they go to a coin shop or an online dealer and buy some. He made it sound as if only nerds capable of solving complex math problems could get coins easily.
Bloomberg continues to fail on Bitcoin and it brings into question all their reporting on things that I don't have expertise in but rely on them as a source of information.

I don't think people are obsessing about the price as much as they are about the actual cause of the price drop; namely government interference hindering adoption of Bitcoin and limiting personal freedoms.
This Zipzap news gives me hope that the price of bitcoins will rebound by early next year as people will have an easier time obtaining coins. The next few weeks may be a good buying opportunity.

You can only help the economy by doing what is best for you. If you are spending, but would actually prefer to save bitcoins, then you are doing yourself and the Bitcoin economy a disservice.

Unfortunately most people today use fiat currencies both as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. With all the USD that the Federal Reserve is printing, interest rates are extremely low and therefore people who are saving in USD are not able to generate enough interest income for the future. Clearly, it is not wise to keep ones USDs in a savings account for retirement purposes. If interest rates were higher then it would preserve ones purchasing power over time and the USD could easily function as medium of exchange and store of value.
On the other hand, gold has proven over the past decade or so to be a great store of value and I suspect will continue to do so given the worldwide easy monetary policies of central banks. Also, some believe that physical gold's actual price should be much higher than it is now because of suppression by various Wall St. products. This belief seems plausible especially when I hear stories that it will take the US several years to fulfill Germany's recent gold request.
IMO, it is wise to keep one's savings in gold and and only keep a small amount of USD on hand for short term purchases. This way I can protect myself from fiat currency devaluation and would not care too much about its stability.
All in all, both gold and USD can theoretically be media of exchange or stores of value but in reality their role depends more on the Central Bank's current monetary policy.

I don't think that the Chinese government is doing this but
it would be a lot cheaper for them to buy a significant portion of bitcoins than their current strategy of purchasing large amounts of gold. Heck, they could even afford to do both!

Looking at your charts it seems like the bubbles didn't correct straight down. There is some horizontal movement in the price correction so they hit that trend line at a higher level.
I stick by my original statement that 250 seems too low. My guess is still between 400 and 500. Time will tell.
I have zero technical analysis experience and am basing this on my gut and experience with the April BTC bubble only.

I have a feeling that once the US finishes with their upcoming "studies" of Bitcoin they will put a lot of restrictions on its use. The US will then pressure Canada and get their "mind right". Bottom line- Canada will end up doing whatever the US does.

The whole point of bitcoin is to remove the power of money creation and control from the State. 
When this is done banks, and more specifically central banks, can no longer serve as tools of the State. In a bitcoin economy there is no central bank available to the State to print money ad infinitum to bribe the people, there is no central control over interest rates. This is very different from the banks that would evolve in a free market bitcoin driven economy who would return to their original role of keeping money safe.
The most important thing we can do is keep the blockchain as distributed and decentralized as possible and build on top of it.

I would use these banks if the fees were reasonable and would even lend out my coins at a certain interest rate. I would require that the banks have their deposits posted on the blockchain for complete transparency. Trust in these banks would ultimately be dependent upon this transparency. I suspect competitors would enter the market who could use their combined deposits to insure eachother in case any single bank had coins stolen. 
These banks could also offer off chain transactions for their customers (I think Coinbase does this already) thereby reducing the stress on the blockchain and reducing scalability issues. Smaller transactions would be immediate with no wait times for confirmations. Fees would be paid to these banks for this off chain service, which would have otherwise gone to miners.

The way you phrased it is great. If spokespeople don't explain this feature of divisibility, then the whole idea of running a Bitcoin economy on 21 million units seems ludicrous to the layperson (and so it should because the world economy can't function with only 21 million non divisible units).
