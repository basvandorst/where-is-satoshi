Only invest what you can afford to lose, personally I'd bung most into BTC and split the rest between the other two. LTC has done very well for me, I bought two at £48 a few months ago

When should I sell oh benevolent one 
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:56:49
How high we think it's gonna go this time? I reckon around $85k, then back down to circa $9k when it pops
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:49:32
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:42:56
It will never reach that high
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:29:06
I am a little more conservative than most. I think the next ATH will be towards the mid/end of 2021 and will be around $75k. When the bubble pops we’ll drop down to $18k, and the following bull run will take us into 6 digit figures. I don’t see a 10mil BTC ever happening personally, at least not in my lifetime
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:01:32
I have a bunch of savings I am tempted to do this with but I don’t want to lose it all either. Both options are risky. Hmmm

“A prophecy that misread, could have been”
@_date: 2019-10-01 15:13:40
Remember - 'past performance doesn't guarantee future results'
The percentage gains in comparison to the previous ATH post-halving have varied each cycle, but decreased each time. The last ATH as $20k so I think 4x for the next ATH is reasonable. To be honest I'm just guessing though, I have no idea. It could do nothing and gradually fall to a few k

The cursed image returns! Sell your BTC!
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:10:00
How were you to know? Try not to let it eat away at you.
@_date: 2019-08-03 08:36:47
...if you invested in 2010
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:33:30
Does anybody want me to lower the price of BTC so you can buy in? Basically what I'm asking is, should I finally bite the bullet and buy 1BTC?
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:58:51
I mean, yarp?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:01:12
Why would BTC be positively affected by this? Expecting Wall Street money to flood into the ‘safe haven’ (lol) of crypto if there’s a crash is wishful thinking. BTC would probably dump too in the event of a 2008 style economic crash as people would need to pull their money out of crypto
@_date: 2019-02-15 11:00:14
Will be really interesting to see how high it goes ‘next bull run’ (still a while to wait imo if it ever happens). I wonder how many bag holders who bought at or near ATH are still chomping at the bit to unload and get their money out. Market is definitely a different beast this time 
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:45:05
I’ve always had the mindset of only investing what I can ‘afford to lose’. I’m not sure I’m comfortable putting any more money into the market - I can ‘afford it’, I just don’t want to lose more money that could be better spent elsewhere perhaps 
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:11:04
I still don’t think it will make it to 100k, I could see 80k though
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:47:47
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:48:14
Unfortunately I wasn’t in the game then, but good to know 
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:10:16
The next ATH and subsequent bubble pop is going to be really interesting - I wonder what the high and low will be
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:10:26
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:54:05
I’m getting serious FOMO right now, wonder if it’s a good time to buy in again 
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:01:56
If I was a millionaire I’d definitely be part of the 21mil club. Probably a few more so I could sell them at some point too
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:48:06
December 2017 was definitely not a good time to buy BTC
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:08:07
As far as I’m concerned the true bull market doesn’t ring in until we’ve passed the previous ATH. Here’s hoping anyway
@_date: 2019-04-22 11:25:08
Oct - Nov 2021 will likely be the next ATH but imo it won’t be as high as you think, probably as high as $80k max.
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:34:55
This gonna dump harder than my asshole after a spicy curry 
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:34:00
Historically the new ATH has come a year after the halving
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:50:14
Lmao I got this too. Fuck these assholes
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:13:38
Congrats - you either have decent parents, or rich parents! Do you still think you'll make it to $1million? Good look to you I say
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:23:29
One thing I’ve learned from this is to never, ever discuss your investments with anyone that you don’t need to. They’ll either be jealous you made money or smugly call you a fucking idiot for losing it 
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:18:50
 Has anyone noticed that on certain sites/comment sections there is a lot of hate and smugness targeted towards those who spent money on crypto last year? Prime example being The Verge website. I don’t get why they give a shit if they don’t have skin in the game 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:11:07
Good luck I wish you good fortune 
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:58:52
@_date: 2019-09-02 08:20:39
As if 1mil or even 100k isn’t ‘moon’ already.
@_date: 2019-09-02 09:30:36
True that
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:24:59
What I don’t understand is how people go on and on and on about NOT leaving BTC on exchanges but then expect people to use stop losses to not get rekt
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:20:26
A lot of people will tell you to dollar cost avg or whatever. Personally if you can afford to buy 4BTC now, can accept that it could all go to zero and don’t care, I think you should buy it now. The price could go up next week... it could go down. You could’ve bought 8BTC with the same cash a few months ago.
Nobody knows what’s gonna happen. Buy it now and wait.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:55:43
Honestly - Nobody knows really! Looking at the pricing history there are patterns (parabolic price increase running up to and several months after the halvening) but there are no guarantees
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:35:34
In that case would you be kind enough to send me 1BTC pls 
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:54:47
I still don’t think we’re at the bottom. January-March next year will be lower imo 
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:38:25
Wish I could afford 1 BTC. I just want one
