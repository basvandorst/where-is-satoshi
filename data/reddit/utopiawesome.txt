Is there a or There is where this could go
This OP could be a comment in if there is a then this is just the type of post to go there

The internet? What are you looking for?
I have a soon to be released physical coin, but only 50 will be made; perhaps you want one?
@_date: 2016-04-08 03:58:37
This is certainly a post
@_date: 2016-04-06 01:37:37
And custom stickers like that run at least $200 if not $1000+ so they prepared ahead of time for this
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:03:41
Doesn't think only assume that the fork is not planned for and people are not well prepared for it? 
Have a look at the stuff at satoshi.nakamotoinstitute dot org and see what Satoshi thought about forks, they aren't anything too scary if done right. And the other thing is, no one can stop you if you want to make a fork they just don't have to follow you. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:43:52
How again is a well planned upgrade with a hardfork so dangerous? And can you back up that opinion?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:53:01
This tells me you don't really understand what is happening at all, why not go to the 'other' bitcoin subreddit and read the FAQ? then come back and make a well reasoned argument of your opinions
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:05:31
Ouch, there are 2 more being looked at but this makes things look way worse for them.
Can the twins try again with another 2 years of waiting?


@_date: 2017-03-05 19:56:57
I don't think that's true though. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:59:21
But they address completely different issues, it's an apples to oranges comparison. And frankly I don't see all the issues as having been satisfactorily worked out. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:32:47
This is where you should start
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:29:46
all of SN's stuff pretty  much was
be arned, the bitcoin SN explained is not the one the Core devs are working towrdas, 
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:19:21


I don't see any other possible way to understand what Greg Maxwell, is saying if he isn't saying that blocks should be full (note that here we are discussing Satoshi designing Bitcoin not to ever have consistently full blocks)
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:38:11
I;m not sure, the cost of mining a coin is probabkly near $400 USD at this point, with the havling that would go to 800 right away
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:18:34
Well, from a business perspective, why shouldn't they?
@_date: 2016-06-24 22:32:32
video auto-play? count me out
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:18:29
So in summary, all people can't run personal nodes which is fine because that was the original design. There is political disagrement.
There are options that move us further away from the Bitcoin Whitepaper.
It seems to me there are no good *technical* reasons not to raise the limit only political ones. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 05:11:02
Is this just your own post of the info from this post: ?
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:23:05
Whoa I would never use this system! Is that an official iOS version at this point?
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:40:01
That's not true, please do everyone a favor and do more research. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:30:45
Gavin was left in Control of Bitcoin by Satoshi and in the kindness of his own heart shared the commit access giving us the core devs we have today. 
He campaigned for years to help btc from a problem he saw as getting worse. He proposed a solution with a hard fork, as bitcoin was designed to use in those situations.
He said he thought some guys used to be SN (or is an elaborate hoaxer) based on proof *no of you have seen* and he stuck to his convictions after none of us saw what he saw.
There is no reason to demonify him at all, his has been far more cordial and data driven than many of the current devs. 
Where is he? I don't know but we need him back, back in charge.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:31:10
Bitcoin is a decades long investment. Your money is fine, with hard fork (a integral part of btc's design) you'll be fine since your coins are on all chains.
Until something better than btc comes up, or the internet goes away. Think of it as an investment into a fund you can't move for a year. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:43:27
Can you comment on this article:  please?
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:55:28
So like the opendime or that polymer btc notes that were around a few days ago?
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:11:17
I don't follow, when I read through the satoshi.nakamotoinstitute I got the very clear idea that in no way were block ever intended to be 'full'. It's like some people are trying to re-write history and brnad their ideas with the name of an already existing idea
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:14:30
1) in the original design of Bitcoin, bigger bins were mentioned. 
2) It's fine if you want to create a new system and alt-coin, but it's dishonest to try and call it Bitcoin. At least in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:38:11
I don't see anything wrong with what they have been doing nor why they have done it. Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:25:42
To be fair, wasn't seg wit plan like D after a series of other scalling proposals were rejected for being too conservatie such as the BIP102 2MB stopgap measure 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:20:19
Do you have any supporting evidence? 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:17:26
Nodes are important do 2 things and 2 things only.
Supply miners with the full blockchain, this decentralization of the ledger supports the network as long as no group can gain over 50% sustained hashpower. 
Assure people of their own txs.
Only the nodes in the top situation will help btc, the second may become a limiting factor which stops btc growth if there is a requirement for it. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:01:05
I think that's a very reasonable shower bitcoin thought
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:53:02
If everyone does this then no one has done this. It seems very clear logic how this is a bad practice.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:24:02
I think it's a great idea and I wish iother wallets would have incorporated it long ago when it became an option. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 20:55:03
Well not to nit pick or anything but if I were going to try and sabotage the system I wouldn't think I could get an obvious exploit through at once, obviously. 
What I would do would be to change something simple to make it more complicated, then later do it again. After a few iterations I have a system that is slightly more complicated than before, and every peice works on it's own, but it may be possible to dream up a way to put some pieces together that make something bad.

Memes are the best you've seen. That explains a lot about the education level of the comments in this sub
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:32:35
All logic would reason that by the time gavin was invited to the CIA (and told everone about it) that the CIA already knew a bit about it from their own inside man.
All logic would dictate that gavin is not the CIA plant, but that there is one. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:35:33
the person you're talking to is a well known troll (or they have never tried to understand how bitcoin works and actively ignored information) 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:32:07


tell me more
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:41:04
That doesn't mean anything for the security of bitcoin (which was created with the end design of full nodes being run in millions of large centers and not home computers)
it's like some people want to make a system that everyone can run but no one iwll use
@_date: 2017-01-21 07:47:56
So one side lied to their supportes and thought they knew better and lost what should have been their because they were so dishonest? That sounds like Core alright
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:36:55
I see you have a very strong opinion, I ask you to provide some hard data to back it; can you back up you opinion with reality? 
@_date: 2016-11-22 01:45:53
Yes, 
at least for the early adopters who signed on to a vision outlined by Satoshi and in the whitepaper.
If Bitcoin, as designed, fails then Bitcoin has failed a great many of us. A settlement system far removed from anything described in the Whitepaper isn't Bitcoin, it's some alt-bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:37:32
That doesn't fit with my definition of Bitcoin which I got from reading all of Satoshi's public writings. 
Not everyone would run a full node in originally planned future bitcoin. Plus most people who can run a node right now *don't*.
@_date: 2016-11-05 17:01:23
Certified? 
But daddy, he's bonafide!
[Free content for everything to know about btc]( 
[Free online course from coursea](
[Mastering bitcoin]( explains all the parts of the system (subject to change)
[And of course the whitepaper]( and [writings of satoshi](
You don't need no certification!
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:36:51
So, for the record, you do not have any sources at all for a statement you made.
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:08:44
So about what BIP02 was when it was reject by the community for being too conservative? 
When can we expect the ~2m (is that less than 2MB?) data cap to be hit?
@_date: 2016-12-18 10:31:59
Well we all know bitcoin was not designed or created with the intent for everyone with a poor internet connection to be able to run a full node, so let's think about how we could help them?
 * education
 * access (to exchanges and such)
I understand your vision to have the 'open dime' style of transfer; I saw your post to Batman Beyond long ago where they guy grabbed a cred stick from a machine; but I don't think that is what Satoshi created Bitcoin to be. I hope you'll answer me (and not just nuke this comment) and that we can work together to clarify things. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 05:42:01
What I read long ago was there was a turnign poitn when most articles about the WWW stopped explaining it at the beginning 
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:59:37
Doesn't this already exist?
and there were more no?
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:52:17
Perhaps you can point out for me the problems you have with that statement. 
From a factual and technical standpoint, what is false about it?
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:56:55
So we can be suspicious about that, what things can we not be rightfully suspicious of?
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:46:40
Not to call you a liar, but do you have any sources for that, even at all?
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:15:47
Well are they not the ones who do make that call?
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:31:23
Everyone gave you guys a hard time last time you posted here but I think it's a cool idea, [like the cred sticks in TV shows]( this is far from how Satoshi said btc should scale this doesn't hurt if it is not relied upon to do everything' ). The world can run on btc and this can (in theory) be a secure way to trade btc off-chain.   
It's like a usable physical Bitcoin. [I wouldn't use it for cold storage]( for many obvious reasons but if it was mass produced it could be cheap and ubiquitous in the future. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:42:51
Where did I hear the phrase, 'btc is future money, not apocalypse money' before? It seems fitting here.
@_date: 2016-12-19 02:30:53
So the solution to a polictial problem is to allow it, and try to be even more political?
@_date: 2016-09-15 01:36:34

have you read anything else that SN wrote? You don't sound like you have

Anyway, great idea I did run it and found it here 
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:52:29
Nonesense, I would love to have somehting like that availalbe on a website. I think it would be useful to idiots like myself as well.
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:18:25
It is mine. Basically I didn't have a printer, so I wrote down the secret key and address, copied them twice each but it now appears there is a problem with what I wrote. I wrote it down so I could look it up later, and send money there
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:44:29
Okay, I see what you are saying. A wallet would be more useful but I was simply storing individual secret keys, more like buried treasure. I can send money to the address, but never use it. 
It is of course cold storage and not intended to be used. 
I know how to save bitaddress and check it, what programs would you recommend for the wallet?
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:54:57
Care to explain that a bit more.
What makes something proper? Your opinion? Or is there some actual consensus and definition?
This is all in the past, I didn't have access to any of that, what I had was a secure copy of bitaddress and a computer, no printer, no flash drive, not a computer that would ever be used again. I did what I could becaseu that is what my research led me to believe was safe and effective. I would be very interested to hear any actual reasons why a paper wallet is not proper because it isn't a seed. Note that of course these wallets were made years ago.
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:51:59
Why do you say it is not safe?
Also, it was a bip38 encrypted paper wallet. paper.
Isn't there just as much risk of me losing or ruining this paper as a flash drive? I don't want to keep it on my computer as I only have one hwich is always online, even using truecrypt I would prefer not to. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 01:51:25
Corrupting existing developers or somehow getting them to follow a confusing scheme that was intended to hurt the system without anyone notice. Then call all who notice shills or enemies. Like that quotation about how people don't want to go to war but you call those who don't not patriotic and ostracize them or pay people to do that in public for you. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 04:15:00
Are you saying not to use paper wallets?
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:41:53
Yes a very good point. And as I remember so well, it's no fun writing down all those chars, and doing it twice. Where I messed up though was I didn't double check my written words to the screen; making it all my fault. But I could have, had I not been to lazy.
Yes yes, that's what all this was about in the first place. electrochemical plating 
@_date: 2016-05-11 01:48:04
this doesn't quite make sense, if you send them a secret key, then the address is derived from that SK and can't be one they didn't have before 
@_date: 2016-05-18 00:49:18
If you insist on reading be sure to read other reddits or sources too as this reddit has become something of an echo chamber and much new and exciting new is restricted.

Not sure, but I think this is more or less just the type of post that was ment to live in @_date: 2016-07-28 18:53:54
It makes security something that maybe should be explained, which makes it more confusing, which turns off newcomers (one of the few things I have seen do such an action in regards to btc, the others can't be mentioned)
As far as myself I don't want people who I got btc from to know what I am doing with it so it influences my behavior and use of the system, more specific txs but it may end up being more volume on the BC.
I like some of the ideas you mentioned that I saw [from here]( and I do think that is one of the most important needs in btcland right now.
I predict most the responses to this question will get axed.
@_date: 2016-07-14 02:20:46
At the time it was not a misconception. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:03:47
Yeah, people cl;aiming they were getting paid to post on this subreddit have posted before, there have been accusations of bots commenting and trying to shape or direct the conversation and the sheer number of commenters who when pressed clearly know nothing about btc or its history but are very vocal and adamant in their opinions leads me to not trust any of the comments in this reddit specifically.
Also, I think that is part of what corporate is trying to show example of

@_date: 2016-07-21 14:13:50
Nice if true, but I don't see why it wouldn't be; I have assumed these stuff was going on on a grander scale for a while now. But good on the OOP for making it more public. Sounds like a or post in the title.
I'd like to know morem, does it use history of just current price, would feeding it the all time record distord its prediction?
