Send them an email, they cancelled my 205 order then honored it after my email
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:31:22
Well, you can already say it's off a bit since we're at $300 already
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:14:57
I tried to sound professional and what not.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:13:18
Took me a day or two to get a reply, just hold out man

Just because he's looking to cut his losses does NOT mean he's trying to daytrade
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:14:28
Nothing so far, I'm hopeful though.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:15:14
Gotchya, already did, and thanks for the re-assurance.
@_date: 2013-11-01 05:57:20
Awesome. Glad to hear they're On top of it

You accidentally a word. I purchased .2 bitcoins, worth about $40 (now $47)
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:13:22
I think he's laughing at your last sentence
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:26:22
This bill guy sure likes his drugs
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:15:01
Yeah, I just bought .194 btc and spending $40 on 20% of something struck me as odd, but I felt it was the right thin to do
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:46:28
I got the same about 2 hours ago, they must have just been backed up
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:14:06
That's what I was wondering, like can they really not eat a $40 loss? When they already have my money?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:49:41
My interest for bitcoins originally started when the ASICS from BFL were first being sent out, I considered investing $500 into BTC but I backed out, had I done that I'm fairly certain it would have turned into around 20K, but oh well, I recently bought in an have seen a 5x return already

He never said he wanted to day trade, but he's insinuating that after a 10% drop he may have felt uncomfortable and sold out.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:40:08
I just did, thanks for the advice.
