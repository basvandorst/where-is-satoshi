I am from Kazakhstan. Unfortunately, not much activity here. Even absolute majority of IT people, programmers do not own any Bitcoin. At least at this point they all heard of it, and somewhat understand.
I would say Kazakhstan government maybe warming up to the concept of Blockchain because they hear good things about it everywhere else in the world. Our largest telecommunication company Kazakhtelecom recently had a workshop on the topic of Blockchain, so it seems they are interested too, even so they do not probably understand how exactly is it useful.

To prevent censorship, so that a central banker cannot turn my money off, e.g. if he disagrees with me politically. If all coffee places use the same centralized method of payment, and I am banned from that system, I cannot drink coffee anymore.

It will allow late adopter to also get value from Bitcoin by actually using it as a currency. This way everyone wins - early and late adopters.
If Bitcoin cannot be used to pay for things, then it is a bubble, because late adopters will probably lose money, and not get any value. This way only early adopters win by taking money from late adopters.

If blockstreams and coinbases of the world will start to censor your cups of coffee and everything else, except maybe your large onchain $30k transactions, what would you do? Will you be able to find another lightning network hub that accept you as a client, so you can use your money?

How would you use good old on chain if the cost of a transaction is prohibitively high?

People who advice you to hold have made themselves investment in Bitcoin. They want their investment to grow. Therefore, they advice everyone to buy and not to sell, hoping to increase demand and decrease supply, pushing price up.

I've ordered one time several days ago from a seller who had several good reviews. I am expecting delivery now. The experience was decent, except searching for items works better on  than in native client. I expect OpenBazaar to catch on sooner or later.
Also I posted an item for sale. Will see whether it sells.
