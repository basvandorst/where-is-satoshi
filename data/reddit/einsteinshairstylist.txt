coinmarketcap already offers an iOS app. I believe u/MarkReddit7 is trying to accommodate mobile browsers :)
Edit: I confused [coinmarketcap](coinmarketcap.com), which *doesn't* offer mobile apps, with [coincap](coincap.io), which offers both android and iOS apps

Because they took bitmain money and did 180degree on segwit stance.

Some Bitcoin exchanges employ blockchain analysis to flag "suspicious" coins and ban users.

Spend them. Take them. Trade them.

Personally found stellar more open?

Arbitrage.

You mean sellers?

Shoot... I meant uasf
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:39:26
For blockchain.com, you do own the private keys. 
For coinbase, you're trusting them as they hold the private keys. 
Personally, I recommend [copay](copay.io)
@_date: 2017-05-04 07:37:56
Originally named copay
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:27:43
Nah it's just fiat stuck in transfers. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:18:22
imho stellar does the same thing better

Definitely agree we should keep it simple for newcomers. 
It's not a choice between web and hardware wallets though, "app wallets" are a good compromise: electrum, copay/bitpay, bread wallet, samurai, mycelium...
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:36:58
Please don't. As you've mentioned, there's no way to prevent the seller from writing down the private key. Just print your own paper wallet. :)

@_date: 2017-05-02 01:46:23
I'm confused. Isn't the notifying/explain-yourself thing a part of the transfer itself, like your bank would require you to fill out forms for large amounts? Or maybe that's not the way in Europe. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:47:01
Set up a mobile wallet for them and gift them some coins. They watch the price and want more.

Looking forward to the day I buy bitmain and open source their chips :)

Prosecuted like police knocking on your door? Not some scammy emails?
Anyway, what you're looking for is a block explorer, like blockchian.info 
But as others mentioned, the burden of proof is on the authorities.

Set up my account quite a while ago. It didn't take long. Maybe a day or two and most certainly within a week.

Google trends has a good correlation with Bitcoin price, with google generally preceding the price. From recent google trends, we will likely stay bullish in the short term.

Try importing your seed into another wallet? Quite a number of people are complaining about multibit
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:08:32
The problem is unconfirmed transactions may eventually get thrown out of the mempool. Worse than double spend.

How about bitflyer, is it regulated? Thx
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:55:29
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:19:24
For sure. Bank transactions are reversible and complicated to verify, while bitcoin transactions are irreversible. If you were selling bitcoins, you would want to get the fiat first before sending any bitcoins to avoid scams and loss.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:18:14
How is it different from other Bitcoin timestamping services like proofofexistence.com
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:02:03
Mine altcoins. Monero recommended. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:54:33
Think op meant transaction fee and custom fee
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:45:25
Side note: stellar or ripple might be more comparable to wu and bank transfers.

Not much you could do, unless you have 51% network hash power to make a chain fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:04:11
You have your point. Exchanges that don't allow withdrawals shouldn't be counted as part of the market.

Good wallets that gives you direct control to your coins (your private key):
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:40:12
Transaction fee and thus confirmation time is independent of the transaction amount (but dependent on the number of "inputs" and "outputs").
To get confirmed within 30 minutes, the fee usually ranges from around one to a few dollars.
Wallets (the sellers' wallet) usually suggests the fee based on a setting of e.g. High/medium/low

Good: run a full node
Great: run a uasf node :D

Sounds legit to me too. Just pick a comfy place and remind him to pay a higher fee.

r/bitcoin is generally pro-segwit

At least start now. If she's to get her own exchange account verification will take time. If you're doing bank transfers that takes time too. Not to mention she needs a guide (you) on setting up a Bitcoin wallet.
