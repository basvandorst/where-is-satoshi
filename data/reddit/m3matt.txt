An attacker would need to know you're using this method. You could trick it up a little more and reverse the characters in your 25 letter phrase - or use the 2nd word in the list that starts with that letter.  Only you know the formula. But if you make it too complicated it becomes harder to remember the formula.

Try bitmex.com - I have an account but haven't used it as I'm not really a trader and would prefer not to use leverage.

Although you specifically stated that you want to withdrawal into a bank account there are other anonymous options such as using something like localbitcoins.com - however the exchange rates aren't as good.

Good advice.  I too would like to sell to ensure my initial investment was returned, but really I wish I had bought more.  I'm not selling -
 I'm HODLING!  And if I lose it then it was fun. Ain't gonna happen though.

Kinda, I suppose - but a single phrase for 25 words, not just moving letters one spot in the alphabet.

Yeah, thanks. The phrase wouldn't be easy as in my example. It would almost look like a private key :)

$5 wrench attach or $5 drill attack on your safe - at least with in memory storage there's 5 minutes of denial. With a safe there isn't any denial. Just hard evidence.

Yes, I see your point. Thanks for the numbers.
