This looks like the S&amp;P 500 overlayed with radar flight data from a mid-sized airport overlayed with head shot blood spatter patters based on caliber overlayed with a EKG of someone being tazed to death

I agree the elites and either political party are not interested is serving us peons. But social media, tv, and film is dominated by liberals and leftists.  The squashing of free speech, 2A rights, etc is from the left. (See Virginia)   As a libertarian,  I see the left destroying the country and eroding freedom.  YouTube has been demonitizing videos, limiting views, banning creators, blocking all comments, and in some cases actually harassing creators.  All because of opinions or content that differs from the "tolerant left".    In this crypto case, your free speech has been trumped by their piggy banks

Yeah, I got the wording and mining rewards results a lil ass backwards.  I expect steady btc price decline til may 2020, then steady increase afterwards. Its happened twice already and the world is ripe for currency not manipulated by central banks

Halves the reward for miners. Its happened a couple times already and increases scarcity of btc. May 20 2020 is the next "halvening"

The block chain calculations are getting harder and miners are making less $.  When btc splits, you'll double $ and mining will become lucrative again
