You want bulls to ... keep on losing versus selling pressure?
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:46:46
Let's not lie. We had better buying opportunities in past weeks.
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:05:25
Wow looks like this is FOMO time. Glad I loaded up this morning.
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:05:24
Aaaaand it's gone!
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:39:17
Volume is so low right now. Next move may be up or down but either way it will be again an irrational +/-10%
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:49:52
Fork her.

Crypto can look big to you right now but in 2009 I guess governments / intelligence had other things to do than discover Satoshi. Now Bitcoin works without his creator so I think if a government knew who Satoshi is they would not necessary call him out at it would be huge hype for Bitcoin &amp; crypto currencies in general. Anyway we already have a short list of potential Sat's.

If yours goes up on the morning you know you have to buy. Otherwise you sell. That is dickline.

How space could be an issue? Do you live in a 8sqm room? In a car maybe?
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:12:39
Nice try mate. Everytime I read these bullish prediction I see bitcoin price go down just after.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:30:29
Actually this is very standard pump and dump on a 75-80$ price range. Zoom out and you will see one flat day with low volume so far. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:01:42
"Steady" source of capital. Then crypto is definitively not a good pick for your need.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:29:35
Do you really think they will invest in crypto currencies &amp; blockchain because it is a disruptive technology with arguably bright future? Of course not they will short / pump / dump and make big $ out of it. Even more when you have redditers who FOMO in each time you have a 100-200$ price increase. To the MOON guys that is so nice of you to feed old billionaires ! 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:15:03
You called it right on time. Good job ... I guess.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:34:12
HODLers right now: 
@_date: 2018-04-30 20:45:09
Every three days someone is calling for a "deathcross" critical moment back with shitty TA. Then we just move on with very standard price action but nobody is there anymore to compare actual performance with original predictions. Rewind. Erase. Repeat.

We see some high spread spikes on GDAX for most currencies today. Coupled with quite high volumes that is a sign of heavy live/day trading. Had some success/luck at it today with a nice +3%. However it looks like Vegeta is going away so I will stay on the side until market tension is resolved. Easy to get burned in these situations.
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:46:07
So the guy own 1 BTC (=8000$ investment, arguably less if invested a while ago) but do not have a few bucks to pay taxes? Give a cookie to that man!
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:53:55
We got rejected. Quick give Vegeta some magic beans!
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:52:29
They are coming in waaaaaaves!
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:47:18
Any reason to justify huge pump would have done the trick anyway. Traders *need* these highly speculative moves so I bet at any time you will always find a coin pumping 15-20% a day event if you have never heard about it before.
@_date: 2018-04-30 12:04:28
Says the guy with limit sell ready. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:27:09
and ... a red wild dildo appears!
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:48:49
And I believe next level will be 0,13$. "Seems likely". Lol guys do you actually read yourself before posting something that ridiculous?
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:09:48
Congratz what a good timing.
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:13:18
Another fail at 7,5k. It looks like we entered in a slight correction which should last a few days. Anyway market is recovering and day trading was much easier to manage this Tuesday.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:26:11
Trading volumes were so low today. This is really bad news. Even if we go down further and smart money enters again around 4-5k$ would it be enough to brake ceiling? We will see. Now is time to turn off crypto alerts pretty sure nothing will happen in upcoming days.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:35:57
Why? They are disgusting you if you are looking for short term gains without being on right timing. But holding is actually much worse for bitcoin as it reduce circulating supply which makes price even more volatile.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:41:49


I share most of your analysis but I am not convinced about figures. You said it all: these are "magic" numbers. If market follows an unpredicted move then everybody will refresh and modify price perception accordingly. Also if you look at previous crashes we can find value from -60% to almost -85% compared to highest point. Different contexts, different price impacts. We still do not know what will be lowest point and we will discover it afterwards. Those who will say "it told you so" just happen to have right guess and sometimes did not even invest since they had low trust in their gut feeling. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:28:04
We may land on the dark side of the moon tho :/
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:18:30
Low volume. Very small buy orders. I think it is time for a nice red dildo guys ;)
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:38:26
Bart pattern confirmed. Bullish if 5 hear spike or more. Bearish otherwise. 100% accurate TA.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:39:55
Really? On stockmarket you can have several thousand orders placed in a few seconds. So I do not think you know what financial market looks like to write such nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:04:24
Not today dude. BTC got denied pretty hard at 8150$.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:17:36
Your point is rather strange as resource scarcity is indeed a strong driver of price. If you stay very general the more finite it is the more valuable because a growth in demand cannot be met by supply growth. Which means price increase. Hope I was clear.
