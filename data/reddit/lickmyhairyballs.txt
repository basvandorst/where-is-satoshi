You can't provide ONE scrap of evidence to your claims. buh bye
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:17:04
IF you can sell right before the crash. NO ONE knows when the crash is going to happen. It's pure fucking luck.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:14:34
How the fuck do you know? It might not drop at all or it might crash completely. Stop telling people what to do.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:54
People will spend it when it stabilizes. Why would you spend bitcoin now, that's crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:08:49

@_date: 2017-12-11 04:42:24
Looks like you were full of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:31:43
Better to chuck it all in now while the price is low. Putting small amounts in will get you no where the price is going up and up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:14:11
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:20:42
Yeah I'm sure they'll track him down from his reddit post /s
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:37:06
Someone has to lose for you to win.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:09:33
So...you're just guessing like everyone else then?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:43:27
Only if its used. And at the present time is only being used to make money.

Personally I think you know all about the advantages of bitcoin, you're just trolling. 
Perhaps you should look at spending your time in better ways and unsubscribe from all your crypto currency reddit groups. But you won't because you're a troll and have nothing better to do.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:17:47
sssshhh I'm making money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:13:05

Boost isnt healthy its rubbish
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:24:08
What plan? You can't really plan. At the end of the day it's a gamble.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:39:29
Its a gamble.
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:01:21
Or it could go down and never recover..it's all a gamble at the end of the day. One single event could change the future of btc. Only invest what you're willing to lose.
