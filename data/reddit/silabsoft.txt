You only have to if you want to change your phone number for your authy account when you don't have access to the old number. For example when I moved to China I didn't know my authy app would stop functioning. I had to provide my ID so they could verify I was the owner of the previous number.

in shenzhen the electronic market also has to hide bitcoin related products during police sweeps when they are looking for the knockoff phones and other products that are technically "not legal"

in the event that XT does not get adapted into bitcoin core in the future how difficult would it be to downgrade back?

I'm talking $4 a day $120 a month unless you have some really high end niche content you can expect around $2.00 (and you would be lucky to get that considering most cpm based publisher networks that have high payouts require 500,000+ hits a day 20%+ unique) cpm. Bitcoin is not a publishers wetdream most advertisers want really low rates when its a new field. However just for sake of agurment lets say the site made $20 cpm that would be $50 a day $1,500 a month that isn't anywhere near the 40,000+ expected. So either some numbers are off, something is bullshit, or someone had no fucking idea the true value of hits whe

as a person who has owned a few websites anyone else find the part " Because the site was already generating 2,500 hits per day before OKCoin’s involvement, the parties agreed that should OKCoin generate less than $40,000 in any given month," to either be mistyped or completed bullshit? you would be lucky to make $4 a day with those numbers

its industry standards. Generally it will be used in cases of fraud detection rather than just shared to complete a typical settlement.

Personally I think the easiest way of doing it would be to require a return btc address for the customers then just doing a sendtomany  dailySalesTotalInBTC / numberOfCustomers you can use the bitcoin rpc server for this github has bitcoin rpc clients in multiple languages available.

to be completely fair lets  be honest no "virus scanner" would pick up that code. that being said its absolutely horrific that the daemon was able to run on the same vm as others. If you are not going to spend the time to review the code you should at least sandbox each daemon instance.

I can't speak for the U.S. side of BTER but for chinese bank accounts I have never had a problem getting RMB or sending RMB and getting BTC. I use it quite frequently to avoid getting slammed with international transaction fees by BOA

I use coinbase and never had a problem with them. They have increased my instant limit multiple times. However I have never used their customer service so I can't say much about that end of things.

Maybe that's changed since I last tried to register but how it worked prior was that when registering you select your country and it would not give you the option to change the country code for phone verification. I am a U.S. Citizen with a U.S. bank account I just don't spend much time in the states so I don't keep a U.S. Phone number.

I also have bounced around the various exchanges, Poloniex may not have all the Shitcoins but they seem to be rock solid with support and  usability. It's currently the only exchange I use for shitcoins and Gemini I use for bitcoin.

if you were to download the full block chain with digital ocean you would need the $60 droplet at least. you could probably get by with a cheap seedbox vps as they tend to have more HDD and less power.

I use Bter myself for transfer btc from my wallet to china so I can avoid ATM fee's they have had their troubles in the past but I can usually get my money into a bank account within an hour with them.

It's a nifty idea but I think most people will just end up turning off the alarm and then falling back to sleep which is even worse than snoozing for awhile.
