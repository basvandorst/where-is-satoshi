I own a $2.8 million refrigerator bought for BTC (OTC Sears gift card purchases in 2012) so... Yeah

That indicator is absolute crap. Many top holders are exchange-wallets and buying that turns fiat into BTC (causing outflow to smaller wallets) is a positive.

HMS Cryptopia? I wonder how massive the "Bitfinex Inside Job" is?

He's also a highly paid developer that begs for money, wants to censor transactions to casinos etc. Mental stability level of a 14 year old highschool girl.

Yep, prob bought it in 2015-2016

That's not how it works to maximize profit. It makes total sense for them to secure capital by selling contracts at a fixed price, and simply earning their money on the margin between their total cost, and the price they charge. 
It makes total sense to rent out miners.

Once again proving that HODL is the mental safe heaven of idiots. When 'HODL' peaks, SELL.

Genesis I would argue, is only a scam if you don't read the fine-print. It's not illegal to sell a product that results in a negative value.

Where are all my "Tether isn't a problem, bitches just jealous of Bitfinex' peeps at? Explain again how Bitfinex isn't a criminal enterprise. I'll wait.

Open shadow account using some random idiot as 'institutional trader' or open a business account with fake info - then dump whatever you want, transfer to offshore account and drain it while the investing goes on. Not exactly rocket science. 
Financial crimes work perfect well using traditional fiat and banking. No need to re-invent the wheel.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:08:44
The 'reaearcher' that came to the conclusion that 'Tether is fully backed, but Bitfinex isn't' should probably just stop doing meth. 
Here is the statement in context: The GUN murdered 12 people, the person is innocent. 
The word idiot comes to mind.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:17:48
Can't they just get tether and... Oh my bad.

I'm not sure I have a less surprised face than this.

Kraken is relatively closely tied to Bitfinex, an early adopter of USDT (tether) so.... Maaaaaaaaybe the same people are sort of... Colluding... (

They SHOULD be dead several times over. They STOLE funds from their users when they got 'hacked'. That should have been the end, and the shady ass Ponzi-founders should have gone to jail.
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:57:43
So the reason that Bitfinex didn't commit a crime is that no one should be dumb enough to trust them in the first place, so they can't possibly be thieves since anyone who uses them should expect to lose their assets.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:14:53
Well, technically NOTHING is invincible. And while I don't see Bitcoin 'failing' (not at all actually) thinking it COULDN'T is a huge mistake.

I don't understand why people admire Buffet these days. He hasn't beaten S&amp;P500 in 10+ years, and he owns a TON of super questionable investments in predatory businesses like Insurance, private healthcare and trailer park equity. He's a senile douche with a sub-index track record since the early 2000, why is he interesting?
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:37:34
Wait, didn't they already do one where they simply stole their customers funds and gave them tokens? It worked once, why change the approach?
@_date: 2019-05-01 04:01:36
How is this surprising? Most Millennials are so disillusioned with the current 'Rich gets Richer' financial system that literally only the propagation of wealth and punishes inexperience, young age, and any attempt to work outside the existing system.
Even with Bitcoin still being a long-shot at a 'world currency' or even a long term serious store of value it presents a FAR more attractive option than being scammed inside the current system.

"wasn't exploited' is actually impossible to state with 100% certainty, unless monero is broken.

In defense of this strategy: They already did it once without even asking, and they haven't been punished for that. So...
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:36:42
Most civilized countries. Also: It did. Bitfinex were openly accepting U.S. Fiat customers at the time. That makes it criminal. There are many examples of the fact that when a company accepts financial agreements with U.S. citizens they abide by U.S. financial laws (Neteller, Paymat, etc.) and the U.S. WILL enforce the law sooner or later.

Getting 'hacked' worked last time and they pocketed $850 million for free, don't change what's not broken.

One could argue that having the need to use a mixer that specifically targets 'dirty coin' is the first mistake.

'socializing losses' is ILLEGAL IN ITSELF!!! Jezus, people in crypto really has become accustomed to some shady shit.
You realize that 'socializing losses' is not a thing right? Like.. Bank of America in the banking crisis weren't actually allowed to just 'socialize losses' and take money from your account. That is sort of what the whole banking crisis was about.
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:33:13
Except it's not backed, and not a crypto. If you own Tether, you own an unknown % (if they feel like letting you cash them in) in a centralized shitcoin, backed by a bunch of Ponzi-Muppets that in 3+ years haven't been able to keep a bank, or provide an audit. And that's AFTER stealing $850 million from their own customers.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:46:36
Not necessarily. It's entire possible to 'know' there is a leak without being able to prove if it has been used or not.

This is an important fact that people don't get/remember. He mined a LOT of early coin (as in, he protected the network in it's infancy and was compensated at a market rate). It's not like he threw away a lottery ticket, it's FAR more like him being Wozniak or Gates and simply jumping in on a 'start up' at a VERY early phase. 
Plenty of early investors in Facebook, Google etc. that quit their job before their options vested, and 'lost' as much money.

@_date: 2019-05-17 17:46:01
Yes. At the time of the hack they 'appropriated' 150,000 BTC from their users (a crime). They will through class action or NYAG be forced to pay back 150,000 BTC and in fact go bankrupt NO MATTER what.
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:38:22
Stop saying 'haircut' when you mean theft. The very FIRST base of something being a 'loan' is not to pay it back, it's PERMISSION. The fact that some people were made 'whole' is 100% beside the point. They STOLE an asset, replaced it with another asset WITHOUT permission from the owner. THAT... IS THEFT!
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:03:18
None of that argument is true. You can mathematically prove the existence of black holes without being able to see them. 
It's entirely possible to prove a flaw in code that could allow for an exploit and patch a flaw without being able to prove weather that flaw has been exploited. 
I'm not saying that HAS happened, or IS the case here, but it's entirely possible for such a flaw to exist.
