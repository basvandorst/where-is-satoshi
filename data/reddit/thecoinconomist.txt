You are just being stupid if say it has no value. That is like saying the software you use doesn't have value. You can do things with bitcoin that you can't with currency therefore it has value. Whether or not it's over speculated is another question.

Stabilization comes from traders now being able to hedge instead of having to do a trade. 
For example if prices are ATH trader will get trigger finger because they smell a crash coming like you are seeing now with all these "futures will crash bitcoin" messages. They have to sell their bitcoin if they want to protect their cash thus becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. With futures, this is no longer the case. The same trader can enter into a short position that will hedge any downward movement and go sleep. This means that he never sells the bitcoin. More holding less volatility. Vice versa is true for long positions

Because it's not going to have a impact. Whoever told you it will does not understand futures

Finally someone with some god damn sense. Risk management at any reputable and sizeable firm wouldn't let any significant money into this trade. The only people making such a crazy bet are going to be traders trading with themselves or small size funds. 
Futures are going to be used primarily for hedging. Although I do need some assholes to go and try it maybe drive the price down to 10k please. That would be awesome.

Yep. Gov has it out for bitcoin over there. But that makes sense given the context of the economic structure there. I see a lot of demand for crypto in China though, that is another topic. My point was that the widespread adaption of wechat gives a pretty good preview of what bitcoin might one day look like - but better because you are able to cross borders with it

Yes but for every guy in a short position there is a guy in a long position. It's not as easy to manipulate as you think. Though with how weak the hand of the average bitcoin user is...
My point is that its not going to crash

You do realize hedging will also cap your gains? Hence why it is called hedging? 
Let's assume bitcoin is 1 mil per coin and you can buy 100. You just have to enter into a short position. A short position allow you to sell X good for Y amount at K date. In this case you want to enter into enough short position to allow you to sell 100 bitcoin at $900000 per coin by whatever contract length you want. This strategy makes sense of you suspect a major dip in prices in the near future but for whatever reason you don't want to exit your position but not risk the price drop.

Explain to me what gold is backed by that and how that is different than bitcoin

Short futures position mean he can sell his coins for a certain price. I.e. he can lock in a price to sell even if actual bitcoin price falls to 0. But bitcoin futures are cash settle which means he just gets the difference in actual price versus lock in price of the contract in cash. So he can still keep his coins and there is no delivery.

I was commenting to a friend today about how China basically skipped credit cards in the cash - credit card - mobile payment progression tree. When the need arose for easier forms of payment, the technology was already there for them to pay with phones. The incentive at that point to completely skip the credit card phase makes a lot of sense since the marginal benefit of going straight to mobile was so much higher. 
One of the other things that absolutely blew my mind while I was there were the food deliver app that seamlessly integrated with WeChat payment. It was absurd how convenient it was. 
Can you imagine being in a long distance relationship and simply downloading an app during valentines and have some romantic dinner delivered to your girlfriend with the help of some borderless internet cash?
