And this is when I get worried. When "everyone" is excited about something. Question is when is the pop coming.

Yeah but bitcoin CAN be centralized via hash power and big banks. Say you setup mining groups to signal one direction or another. Or the nodes. Or hell even people on Reddit. 
No one new in the crypto space has really been discussing this. When crypto was in its infancy yes it was secure. But exactly how the hell did Silk Road fall ? I haven't seen a real explanation. But from back then there was discussions of three letter agencies running nodes etc. 
You can call it tinfoil hat. Or an old dog but it def freaks me out. If this was / used to be the bastion of illicit trade. Why hadn't it been banned ? Tor has similar issues. ( created by govt funding. But never banned. Just gets you on a watch list ) 
And the real risk is still coming even from an investment point of view.  Govt backed coins ARE on their way. Or corp backed coins. With a perceived (value). Corp insured / fdic like insured coins with hard usd backing. Are on their way. Now everyone will say"fiat/fiat/fiat" but the mainstream folks  who haven't gotten in. Guess what. That matters. 
Just a disclosure. I am riding this wild ride currently. And will exit 80% of my positions sooner or later. But I also got in when this was like between 2.00 a coin to 25.00 a coin.
