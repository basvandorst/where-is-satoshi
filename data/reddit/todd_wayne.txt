I disagree, I think the monthly chart is predicting a major correction this year. 
[monthly chart]( 
Note: you’ll need to pull up bollinger band and macd on the chart under “indicators”
Notice this months candle has a longer upper wick than it does to the downside. Additionally, note that the price movement is still outside the upper bollinger band. When candles form outside a band they will always correct back towards the mid line. This will be the 1st month bitcoin prints a candle entirely outside the bollinger band.  Granted that 1/3 of this month remains to be printed. 
But knowing how B.B. gravity plays out, I know this month will trend towards that middle line. The month will close lower than today. Next month will print a new candle inside the band, and the correction will continue. The middle band will move up on a new month as well setting itself in the mid 4’s or 5,000. That will be the bounce zone. 
That prediction finds additional evidence on the weekly chart, with the MACD clearly showing a downside cross in the future. Downtrends will follow the cross.

Well then I’d say you need to get your emotions in check when making that buy decisions. Use technicals to take some guesswork out of it: 
Do you look at charts? Whether or not you understand technical indicators and candlesticks, it is a good idea because it will help you visualize the trend. 
I’d recommend  bollinger bands and macd, both simple and easy to follow. Make your buys when the macd crosses over to the upside. 
Bollinger bands mark volatility, and will show you whether a recovery is a dead cat, or if there’s enough momo (momentum) to push a run. When the bands widen, volatility is up and a run (in either direction) is forthcoming. 
Chartschool on the stockcharts.com website is a fantastic resource ( I am not affiliated in any way). Learn some basic candlesticks like bullish/bearish engulfing, haramis, and doji stars. Learn basic indicators like rsi, Bollinger bands, macd, aroon index, fib retracements. 
Find a few combos you like together, and take two weeks to make no money predictions re: price movement. When you feel comfortable, go live. 
Whenever you buy, write down your reason (“bullish engulfing on the 4 HR chart,” “MACD cross on the daily”) and then go back and check yourself for accuracy. As you get into keep a notebook for observations, predictions, buys and sells etc. Trust me, it helps with taxes. The IRS has begun auditing crypto gains, always keep a paper trail.

I did not tell anyone to do anything with Bitcoin today. You either have me mistaken for someone else on this thread, or are simply lying. 
“Timing an exit” is not the same as “taking profit”
Timing an exit: getting out of your position at, or near a high
Taking profit: selling when you have made money. 
Once again, just because you are not capable of finding tops and bottoms on the chart, does not mean that no one can find tops and bottoms on the chart.

Bitcoin has a 5 year lead on most coins, and that lead is narrowing as other coins develop far superior tech and make partnerships to make crypto household.

What jurisdiction? Please make my day by telling me you thought no court could have "jurisdiction" over bitcoins. 
Courts have jurisdiction over people. If a person's bitcoins are at issue in a case, the court has jurisdiction to make a disposition over those bitcoins.
A number of cases in the federal circuit have held bitcoins to be a personal asset, not currency. These cases mostly deal with contracts where performance was to be paid in Bitcoin. 
That's right, even where you specifically intend Bitcoin to be a currency for the purposes of a transaction, it is not a currency 
That's more than enough for you to do a google search

This is not true. The express words of the constitution apply to only the federal government. The constitution in fact expressly states that "all powers not expressly given to the federal government are reserved for the states in their sovereign power." 
Only by Incorporation of constitutional rights through the due process clause of the 14th amendment does the Bill of Rights  apply to states. Incorporation is judicially created doctrine. Thus, the clause which OP cites does apply to the Federal government, its just not the part that gives Congress the power to create and tender currency. It is, however one basis for the currency power. Through the necessary and proper clause, the Congress is allowed to decide the means by which the Federal government is administrated.
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:36:10
You spelled "pump" wrong 
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:53:50
The Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause States, in it's entirety:
   " The Congress shall have Power ... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."
In the case MCullough v. Maryland, the Supreme Court ruled that this power vests, in the Federal Congress, the power to create laws which are "necessary and proper" to the carrying out of the functions of the federal government.In the case, Maryland levied a tax on the Federal Reserve. The Court held that the power to tax is "the power to destroy." States, as weaker sovereigns to the federal government under the supremacy clause, cannot interfere with the exclusive power of the federal government to create and destroy as necessary to administer Federal Sovereign function.
The Powers of the federal government are to lay and collect taxes, raise and arm the military, wage war, etc.
To carry out the above powers, the Federal government is empowered to create legislation that is "congruent and proportional" to the incidental needs of running a federal government. A currency system is one of those powers (incidental to the power to "lay and collect taxes")

No it's not. And if you get your trading advice from a Tony Robbinesque "visualize your riches" trading guru book, you are a fool.  Moreover, any trader who just copies someone else's strategy is bound to fail. 
 If you are not taking some profits whenever a peak happens you are making a mistake. Thats how trading works, the goal is to make profit, both in the short and long term. I sold some coins at $3000, kept some, and have been shorting this crash in derivatives. I have fiat to buy the bottom, I am making coins as it drops, and I still have a core position for the future (which is now constantly being reduced in cost through the addition of profit coins from contracts, and low buys)...... Yea, you're right Hodling works better.
 The idea that a "long" does not take profits is absurd. If you are a long who was in profit at $2900 and bought above the current price, you should have taught yourself how to read a chart or fundamentals, and made sure you were in fiat for this dip. 
Longs who are at cost right now made a mistake not selling. To day otherwise is just more of the delusional vitriol this sub is known for.
