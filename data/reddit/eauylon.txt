Yet everyone keeps expecting politicians to make things better, and things just continue down a destructive financial mess for the nations populace.  
I do have real "hope" that Bitcoin could possibly "change" things for the better.  Financial change for the US (world?) is not possible for a person/politician/leader/messiah/political party to somehow do - its much more possible with a decentralized protocol.  Having said that I have no faith in my fellow Americans.

Those companies *were* regulated, and they *still* committed huge financial crimes.  The politicians who make the laws are part of it, part of the problem.  I don't trust any person or entity in that entire situation, especially any new regulations the same politicians come up with.  
Consumer protection must be offered by each individual vendor.  If its not offered then either do not buy that service or good from that vendor or accept the risk.
Legislating these things messes everything right up - creates bureaucracy which only benefits those in government and those that own the government - the "regulated" entities.  Otherwise bureaucrats would have no work to do and no reason to have a taxpayer paid for job - that's the only reason a lot of parts of government exist, its insane when you see it for what it is.

I'm not an anchro-capitalist, I'm an anarchist. 
How many firefighting companies would one little town need to support?  Why are you asking this?  Why would one little town need more than what covers it?
Your answer, the status quo, works by taking ALL the tax money (which you pay or are jailed) giving multiple administrators large salaries to they can then be approached by unions to get sweetheart contracts for their services.


I think you may be contradicting yourself here.  By your statement here, of which I completely agree, Marx's model nor a true free market has ever existed, especially via a State.  So why is the current model of fake democracy and tilted markets so great?
I like a lot of Marx, but not all.  For one, I don't go for revolution, but evolution.  Forcing change through revolution doesn't do it, and I hold no expectation of humanity *ever* evolving to any kind of better society as I assume we will die out/kill ourselves/destroy the planet well before anything like that were to happen.
I do not make a claim to having all the answers.  I make the claim putting humans in a hierarchy is the problem.  Putting faith in individual leaders and political parties? Yea, that's gotten us far.  Everything is all our responsibilities, not presidents, not cops, nothing like that.  You, me and everyone else is in charge in an anarchic society.  And you, me and everyone else is responsible for everything too.  *Nothing* is "the liberals" or "the conservatives" fault.  In an anarchic society you do not have the option to collect government dole because you are lazy, nor do you have the option to get gobs of taxpayer money for your corporation because you own some politicians.  You work and live where your rights end where another begins.  I fully do not expect anything like this to ever happen.  People like you really wanting to maintain the status quo is what I expect.

It would just be nice for ONCE for consumers to pull their heads out of their asses, educate themselves, and understand the financial industry exists to fuck them hard as much as possible and Bitcoin can end all that. Bitcoin does not need any financial establishment of any kind, if it did it wouldn't be functioning for the past 5 years.
But masses of people LOVE to let 'leaders' think for them. So instead we get people paying attention to this bullshit.
I have unit of value and know how to spend, receive and store it. Boom, done.

Also, you don't know but your arguments are tired, old and run into the ground.  They've been rehashed, poked and prodded and done with by the end of the 19th century...if you were to pick up a book or two you can check on that yourself.  I know I sound like a smug cock, but I do mean that for real and not like a jerk.  Ignorant politicans in the 2nd half of the 20th century liked to throw that rhetoric around.  Save your breath.
I'd give to a fund that provided health care for the poor, as would any other living human with empathy.  I'm against the beaurcacry, awful care, inefficiency, and only done to expand power of those in charge that is Government. 
Its not right or left.  When I was a voter and a slight partisan, I was part of the left yet you probably see what I'm saying as coming from the right.  Its not part of that bullshit, I've left that all behind.

However, think about how fucking fucked up the entire situation is. The government spends a shitload of your money on weapons and people and training to kill you if necessary if you don't do what it says.  
That's what this all boils down to, and it doesn't matter one iota if you fancy yourself part of a political party or even vote.  You have the illusion of a modicum of control, that's it.  I'm not necessarily going to die over that if I can help it, but I'll do everything possible to take a big giant shit all over it.

I have over $4 in spare bitcoin.  Its hilarious watching the price fluctuate, sometimes I have $4.92, later in the day I have $4.67 worth.  Its hilarious because I think of all these dickwads who will not use it as currency, but as a get rich thing, and the price drops and they sell at a loss.  If I fuck around with ~$5-20 worth of bitcoin, my quality of life doesn't suffer if I lose it all.  And if it 'goes to the moon' in the coming years, hey, I'll have some money for doing nothing but fuckin around with a few USD worth.
When I have enough bitcoin to purchase things, I do. Right now I have enough for a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:35:46


Deal with it.  Bitcoin is illustrative of why and part and parcel why I converted from voting for Obama in the '08 primary to an anarchist.  I will live without the government as much as possible - who will build the roads, you ask?  The same people that do now, without having an overlording entity (government) coercively collecting taxes from the populace first and then distributing it to whatever construction company bid lowest and cozies up to the right politicans at the right time.  
Instead of that system construction companies can build a damn road, upkeep kept through tolls, perhaps taken electronically through a cryptographic blockchain. Bitcoin's assoication with Anarchism will lead to wider adoption of Anarchism.  


This part of your post is fucking great and I totally agree with you.

Calm down. I do use it as a currency, as I said. I use small amounts of fiat to buy a little BTC when I can afford it. And then I spend the bitcoin I have because its easy to use, I can show and explain others how you don't need to be a wall-street type cunt, and simply because I find satisfaction knowing my little purchases are part of the blockchain, forever. People like me will be what makes Bitcoin, if it ever makes it to the worldwide adoption. Not Mr. Smalldick Sorevagina.

@_date: 2014-04-03 16:17:28
This has been a great conversation, thank you.  
Are you not aware of anarchists being involved in unions?  Unions can be anarchic, and the things you mentioned do come from anarcho-socialism (or anarcho-communism, I know those are dirty words in modern American parlance, but in reality that's just bullshit rhetoric).  But none of that exists today, unions are an enormous part of the problem and infrastructure of government.  For example, there are plenty of cases of unions today demanding raises and benefits from government jobs that are taxpayer funded - where the local government does not have ANY taxpayer money whatsoever, because they're already running a deficit (due to obscene mismangement and criminality)! Take a look at every state and you'll find like that happening.
Its at least partly because people are hierarchically arranged.  They need to be right when they are on top, being wrong isn't an option - I'm sure you know you don't have to take my word for it, look at any union, corporation or political party.  Even if that's not what a particular leader is thinking or doing, hierarchy in unions, corporations and government relies on exploitation of everyone below and anyone on the bottom usually will do anything necessary to get to the top, no matter how destructive even to themselves much less others (good 'ol upward mobility in 'merica, right my fellow patriot? /s). Now, I'm not talking about having children equal to their parents or students being equal to teachers [although school administrators are an illustration of hierarchical problems], or like refusing to have someone who knows the way "lead" you out of the woods because hierarchy=bad, those are practical matters.  We've been led to believe by an enormous apparatus that who and what governs us is also a practical matter.  I think that's actually true, but in the opposite way its usually meant. Decentralized, anarchic is the practical way.      
The other problem is wages itself.  Its of no use for me to try and explain the 'why' of that right now for two reasons: Any explanation I could come up with would be garbage because I'm just plain bad at explaining it at this point.  And the second reason is I can just refer you to the body of work that has been written about it.
Your last paragraph I'm totally down with.  What you described actually isn't capitalism anymore, and doesn't need to come from an individual on top, but can only properly be put into effect by mutual agreement from everyone involved.  
FYI, I come from the left too, and was a strong democrat during Bush II's years in office.  I even voted for Obama in the '08 primary.  Then he voted to reauthorize FISA and I dropped my support of him.  Suddenly other people thought I'd magically be voting for McCain (and then Romney when I tried to explain why I don't support Obama).  Its absurd. I started to see my views weren't left or right, especially when I saw things on the right I sometimes agreed with.  And then the news of the NSA broke, and any respect at all I had for Obama vanished.  I started to read and think a lot.  The government isn't there for us, its there for those in it.  I refuse to be a party to it.  I do not support revolution of any kind as that is a means of coercion and makes no sense for an anarchist to do.  I believe only evolution gradually is the way, but I also at the same time believe its a lost cause - what I'm proposing with anarchism I fully expect to *never* happen on any widescale in human society.  I guess I'm a pessimistic individualist anarchist.  With time, reading, discussing and experience I'm sure my views will change, but at the present there you have it. If you have reading reccomendations for me I'm all ears (or eyes I guess).

Especially if you think the FDA works for you.

Spare me the peanut gallery comments.  
Your post is confusing, especially this:




But you may have been typing fast and I think I get the gist of it.
I'm not talking about "punishing someone for being too successful" which is a concept the useless left/right paradigm likes to bicker over - and monoplies exist because of gov't (which is a point where ancaps and I agree).  Anarchism would only ever be achieved through an evolution of human kind, an evolution where things like capital and property would do not exist in the way we think of them now.  This sounds like radical nonsense to most people (it has nothing to do with Socialists taken yer guns/property!!1! for example), but it is difficult to explain in a few sentences, *especially* by someone like me who is not a scholar by any stretch and still has much reading to do.  
It also takes a lot of thinking to understand.  Quips on a left/right paradigm will get you nowhere when it comes to understanding anarchism, or honestly, anything at all not related to partisan politics.
Bitcoin exists outside of that paradigm.  I see potential for an evolution to a better world with the protocol, but I also see the potential current paradigm being replaced by something that is different but still all the same problems, which is where ancaps would end up weather they realize it or not.  
However, I thank you for reading my post and commenting.  It appears the rest of has their head in the moon or something.

No no and nope, your taking more than is there from what I write.
I do not argue for a utopia, nor do I argue the arrogant standpoint you mentioned.  
I didn't think I'd have to mention evidence for the hierarchy claim, but take a look around you - EVERYthing is set up that way.  It also goes much deeper than that, may I suggest to you the fiction of Octavia Butler, her Xenogensis series and Patternist series explain much more eloquently that I ever could.  Also, Le Guin's Dispossessed I feel is a very realistic portrayl of the pitfalls of both an anarchic and hierarc


So why do you not have anything to add?  If you can do better than the tradition of anarchism, then please tell us what you got.

If a government or somebody like that wants to attempt a 51% attack, they will. It won't be because they got their panties in a bunch because people criticize their stupid attempts at regulation, they'll do it because they are fucking evil cunts looking to benefit themselves - the same reason anything else is done in seats of power. There is no doubt bitcoin will be tested like that in the coming years, and who knows? It may even fail.

Things like Bitcoin lessen the influence of and make centralized authorities outdated.

However, the point is Bitcoin gives all people everywhere a modicum of control and people everywhere should run with that and literally think about and use politics and centralized *anything* less and less and less. Let the 'masters' of the world go nuts with themselves and leave me out of it as much as possible.
Until they come for me, I guess.

What about banks that are too big to fail?  Situations where those responsible are never held responsible (at least partially because of political financial donations).  That is what government is and does.

Awesome. I listen to him for shits and giggles because I noticed the station on shoutcast. At least he's anti-war. His audience is perfect for Bitcoin.

Nope.  That will be the anthesis of what the Bitcoin protocol solves.  A move away from *ALL* centralized entities.  Government and religion are the two worst.
The protocol can be refined and improved upon.

I know, that poor bus.

This is a very important point that perhaps needs to be beaten like a dead horse: Bitcoin does not ever require a centralized 3rd party for any transaction, at any time.  If you want to give to charity, send some bitcoin to the charity's address. That's it. To the moon.
Just beware of fraudsters, that of course is the major risk and why in certain cases it is worth the trouble to use an escrow and perhaps other third parties. It all depends on what level of trust down to an individual transaction level and to the individual transactors. For example, I want to build a thorium nuclear reactor funded by bitcoin. Please feel free to send donations to this address: 1EUHectkUsK4a79yVTqDoPpEP3FGR8yN9K
Keep in mind you have no reason to trust me as a charity.
