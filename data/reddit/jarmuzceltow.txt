That 1 Mb of additional capacity fron Segwit is not going to cure high fees and limited throughput.

Have no idea why on earth there is no VodkaCoin!

It is obvious fact that bitcoin has the biggest amount of users and transactions. This fact doesn't imply fees and transaction times on every existing coin. The world is not so simple.

Hey, but you don't know what this network was meant to be. It was promised to be p2p payment system for everyone, with no fees, permissionless, with signatures in chain. Today you come just like that, with no idea behind the whole system, you are trying settlement layer, probably only because you would like to be a part of something big? What's your purpose to do this? Maybe you just should think for a while what is your goal and just in case check if you are not a tool of someone with malicious / incompatible plans. I'm just saying, think about this.

How can you know if Segwith had so big community support as shown on your picture?

To be more precise for trades: fiat-&gt; crypto or crypto -&gt; crypto you have to pay PCC always. For all trades you have to pay also separate "income tax " (18% or 36%) but only from gains. Yes, for trades crypto -&gt; fiat no PCC 1% on each trade.

You probably did not understand how this tax works. Example: you bought btc for 800 $ and you panic sold at 700$ so you lost 100$. You are at debit - no Gain tax apply but PCC tax still. You have to pay PCC Tax: 800$ * 1% = 8$. Second example:  Imagine that you have done ten such transactions so you net profit is: -800$. You performed 10 buy transactions so you have to pay 80$ despite fact that your balance is -800$.
