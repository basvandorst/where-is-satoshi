I still have transactions stuck from January 2nd.  I’m glad they haven’t been sent back, because I no longer have the keys for the sending address.  I just hope they go through someday.  My assumption is that somehow a node is rebroadcasting.  But maybe not. Maybe they will be sent back and I will lose them.  Maybe they will remain unconfirmed for centuries.  Who knows?  Moral of the story is any time you have control over the fees don’t skimp it.  FYI my funds in limbo are less than .002 BTC, but I still just don’t like unconfirmed transactions they are a real bummer.  I love bitcoin though this is not FUD. Hodl strong!
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:11:29
I’ve tried lots of wallet software and they always show unconfirmed transactions almost immediately.  If you know the receiving address then it should show there.

Nano uses PIN number, seed phrase, passphrase, and hierarchal deterministic addresses allowing for infinite addresses for multiple accounts and coin types tied back to a single seed phrase.  Oh, and it also performs offline digital signatures.  
Paper wallets are still FINEfor storing crypto.  You just have to generate them offline.
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:07:07
Google "Ian Coleman BIP 39"... Save the HTML
Run the HTML offline and input the 24 word seed.  (you really should also protect with a passphrase)
Then get the private keys and get that bitcoin to some new addresses, because your old private keys are on the Ledger.
Note that the lost Ledger is pretty secure.  It requires your PIN and 3 bad entries will cause the device to wipe itself clean.  But, I just think when you lose it you want to get those funds to new addresses ASAP.  You could use the HTML from "bitwallet.org" to generate a paper wallet offline and move your funds to that.  If it were me, I would not wait to get a new HW wallet, I would input that seed into the BIP39 tool and move all the coin to cold storage immediately.  then you can move it to a new Ledger later.

I don't think it has anything to do with Segwit.  That should work just like any other address.  Did you use low fees?  I've got some transactions unconfirmed.  I chose the economy fees, and maybe they just ended up being too low.  From what I understand worst case they should eventually just return to sender.  I though 2 weeks was when it should happen.  So, you should either get a confirmation soon, a return soon.

Free labor is an interesting theory but the banks already have slave labor through their fiat system.  The simple thing would’ve been to kill crypto 9 years ago and keep printing more fiat to finance more wars over oil.  But they can’t stop it Bitcoin.   So, they are in scramble mode.  
If you tell me “that’s a bankers coin”, then you might as well be telling me “that’s a 30 foot drop into a pit full of rattlesnakes”, cuz I ain’t going anywhere near it.  For those trading it and making money, more power to you, it’s all good, and I will look forward to when you finally drop it and pump it back into BTC.

No, the treasury / government can BORROW money... Every Federal Reserve Note is a loan that must be paid back with interest. 
Money gets created out of thin air in two instances:
1. Federal Reserve Notes
2. Fractional Reserve Banking
Being able to increase the money supply with a push of a button is what supporters of gold have always been against, and with the limited supply of Bitcoin, that's why it's often referred to as digital gold.  
Being able to loan out $100 when I only have $10 is another way that money is created out of thin air.  
All of this is just power plays. But we don't need their money anymore, just like we don't need their wars.  Nationalism is cancer.  Fiat is trash.

Bitcoin's market cap shrinks every day?  I think you mean market dominance, which is really in no way evidence of a "takeover".  Every alt-coin is trade-offs.  Any alt-coin that provides exactly what BTC does would have the same scaling issues.

While I don’t like the dig at bitcoin, I 100% agree that a brainwashing occurs in USA where many people believe that hard work equals success.   Effort will do what effort does, but hard work doesn’t equal success.  Take it a step further, your compensation for your work is related to the value that you create for the war machine, but proportionately you get very little as the money funnels up to those that print the fiat it and finance the wars.
If you make money off Bitcoin, help those that did not.  That would be the humanitarian approach.  
I can see if you had a buddy and you tried to tell him Bitcoin was the future and he wouldn’t listen.  But, if someone was working their tail off and never received the message regarding Bitcoin, there is still no reason they should suffer from totalitarian government.  
Last thing is that it’s worse now than ever before regarding class mobility.  Unless you hit big on bitcoin, it’s rough out there.  College debt just to get a foot in the door at some corporation...   it’s no wonder the concept of working hard to achieve is becoming mostly a marketing slogan.

That’s why it makes so much sense to send me your seed phrase - by mail of course, preferably in a cryotosteel or coldTI to give yourself max security.

I posted on the Mustache Man's blog... says my post is awaiting moderation and I used a fake email, so who knows if his flock will get a chance to read it.  Anyways, I sounded off...
This blog post was nothing more than an angry rant from someone who fails to understand what money actually is. That’s quite a bit of irony considered that his entire website is about financial advice. The Mustache Man is now rooting for bitcoin to fail and fiat to win. Why? Why would you root for the banks… The dollar is backed by war and violence. BTC is freedom. Will it win? Nobody has a crystal ball… It’s just as much conjecture to say the bubble will burst as it is to say the coin will hit 1 million USD. If the Mustache Man really did understand bitcoin, then he would’ve invested long ago, and that pain is obvious in this rant. 
And, for all of you penny pinching frugal folks, there is nothing wrong with that. In many ways it’s irresponsible to spend money on luxury items, etc. But, let’s not pretend like the bankers don’t live lives of extreme opulence and extravagance. Try googling “Rothschild Houses”… Those bankers are not contributing “value” to society… They are making money doing absolutely nothing but profiting off of debt slavery and warfare. 
Bitcoin may lose… But do we want that? Mustache Man needs to question his motives. He’s being way to adversarial here rather than truly trying to be objective about what Bitcoin can do for society. He wants it to lose, because he wasn’t an early proponent… that’s completely transparent here. The Bitcoin community understands the risks, but how else can we attack the tyrannous central banks?
And it’s not about the “blockchain technology”…. It’s about BITCOIN. BITCOIN, BITCOIN, BITCOIN, BITCOIN… Decentralized currency. Blockchain makes it go, but we can’t pretend like the subject is not the crypto currency itself. That’s pure ignorance. Perhaps the banks, the corporate overlords, and the warfare machine will win. But, I wouldn’t bet on it. Remember, it’s not money for the internet, it’s the INTERNET OF MONEY!

What's "inflating"?  BTC is a deflationary currency... And if the value of BTC i.e. the amount of goods and services you can buy with increases vs fiat, then people will accept the volatility in pricing.  
Example:  Fiat with Price Stability..  Honda Accord costs $30k today and $30k tomorrow
Example: You bought a bunch of BTC in 2014... Honda Accord cost 5 cents today and 25 cents tomorrow.. Who cares about the price stability?

You can't credit a Bitcoin private address without actually having the Bitcoin.  The bank can easily just say that your account has $20 in it and my account has $20 in it even though they've actually loaned it away.  They are custodial accounts.  This is not possible with Bitcoin.  Bitbond is not increasing the money supply, only the miners are.  Bitbond is just connecting lenders with borrowers and charging interest for loans.  But, the blockchain ledger makes it to where they must have ALL of the money they intend do loan... The P2P lenders in this dynamic are far different than account holders at a fiat bank.

Trezor and Nano are very similar.  It comes down to interface, alt-coin support, and the one architectural difference where Nano S uses a secure element which some say is more secure, but others say is less secure, because it's not open source.  I really don't understand it to be honest, but I went with Trezor.  I only store bitcoins on it.  The interface is great.  It's almost hard to believe that your keys are not "hot" when you have it plugged in... So, it's pretty much like a hot wallet.

Welfare and poverty can be addressed at the same time as addressing warfare...

It's hard to quantify or prove, hard to say what the consequences would be if we cut our military spending in half... I would like to give it a shot, though.

You can use Coinbase to buy Bitcoin, but then transfer them off to a wallet.  The wallet holds your private keys, which you need if you ever want to spend the bitcoin.  But, the actual coins live on the blockchain.  So, if you lose your phone, you don't lose your keys.  What you would do would be to install the wallet software on a new phone and recover the keys.  At that point, you would move the funds to a new wallet.

That's how the lower market cap coins work.  It goes up 6 cents and you 2.5 x your money.  Of course it can work in the reverse direction.  It's important to learn the relationship between BTC and the alt-coins.  Learn about the history of crypto.  That will help you going forward and almost assuredly will encourage you to keep BTC in your portfolio.  I would say if you have only $17k to invest and you put it all on SIA without any in BTC that would be a fairly large gamble.  Maybe buy half a BTC and then spend 8,500 on alts.  Or just buy one BTC and hope it goes to the moon.

I disagree.  It's like if there were no separation between Church and State.  We must liberate ourselves from the fiat system.  From there, we can talk about politics, structures of government, boundaries of government, campaign financing restrictions, etc.  But, first we have to escape the tyranny of the financial system itself.  Otherwise we're going to be constantly pouring our time and resources into fighting wars and killing people.

You're indoctrinated into the debt-based economic slavery to the point where you're defending it.  I wouldn't be surprised if you also supported warfare as well.
The national debt was the topic, not individual debt anyway...  But, a deflationary currency will promote saving over debt.  And peer-to-peer lending has immense potential over getting loans from the crooked institutions we have to deal with today.

 I wouldn't mind if they took the speakers out to reduce the cost.  Also, this is a boutique company.  If it were more massed produced it would cost less, but then it also won't have the Wow factor when people see it.

This is actually not possible when everything is on the blockchain, because you can't have money in multiple addresses at the same time.  
Loaning money and collecting a reasonable amount of interest is one thing.  Loaning money that you create out of thin air is completely different.

The increase in Money supply is really not the issue, the issue is that the people who put their money into a savings account see the purchasing power decline with inflation while the banks make profits off loaning their money ... If you put your BTC into a P2P lending service, you would see gains.. (in addition to the gains you're getting against the fiat without lending it)  
So, you can see how BTC has tremendous potential to flip the whole money game upside down.  Separation of Church and State is obvious.. And now that we have discovered the blockchain and crypto currency, we can separate government and central banks from our money as well.  Decentralized Peer to Peer.  Let's Go!

The problem being solved is based on a batch of transactions called a block.  Once solved, the next block can begin. The difficulty of the problem is adjusted by the total hashrate of the miners.  Bitcoin mining is called proof of work.  Equipment and energy costs are consumed in the process.  Bitcoin backers believe this proof of work is necessary for the currency to have value.  I would tend to agree myself.  It’s similar to the effort required to mine gold.

Difficulty is all about 10 minute blocks.  So regardless of hashpower a block is solved every 10.  
In the case of a halvening,  I wouldn’t expect any miners to shut down unless their electricity costs had them operating at a loss.  But if they do shut down then it should be even more lucrative to mine where electricity is cheap since the difficulty will be going down.  I do think you’re right that overall the protocol is designed to increase hash power over time.  
With all of this should come a price increase assuming the demand for BTC remains constant.        That will obviously encourage more mining and hashpower.   It’s less than a year away.   It should be interesting.

There’s nothing like the feeling of BTC on an unencrypted paper wallet that you printed from an offline computer and incinerated both the computer and printer after creating the wallet.  unencrypted it’s pure gold you just have to hide it somewhere.   
For long term storage all you need is one address so a paper wallet is as good as anything.  Encrypt it if you want.  Probably the main advantage of hardware is you can plug it in occasionally and make a BTC transaction just to reassure yourself that your store of value is not worthless.   But otherwise you could put 50 BTC on a paper wallet and save it for a rainy day.
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:03:51
If you spend and immediately replenish then the volatility impact is minimal.  It’s still kind of slow and you have to pay a fee to transact, so yeah for me digital gold.... it’s like a new pyramid based on the blockchain.   OGs reign.  Newcomers get gains.

People are learning more about the financial system and economics these days.   That’s why you see the interest in bitcoin.   With fiat we watch the national debt.  With BTC we watch the deflationary aspect as the mining rewards gradually lessen on our way to 21 million.   
My point, though, is that the protocol is serving people today.   If you need to send $500 to someone who holds, owns, and loves BTC such as myself, then it’s game on!  We can do like a $2 fee and zip it on the next block.  No chase bank.  No Wells Fargo.   You know what I’m sayin all you would have to do is hit me with it.  37zK8LzD6voRJfiAPfKiHMRR1tw9WyrXNo

It’s generally not going to move 5% in 20 minutes but it could move significantly by the time the recipient cashed out to fiat.  It works better when the recipient is looking to accumulate bitcoin.  there’s no volatility issue then.   The recipient will accept that as part of the deal.  In the 10 years you speak of accumulating BTC would’ve served the recipient well and it’s completely decentralized.  Glad you see the vision.

The risk is fairly minimal if you’re looking to immediately transition to fiat after a transaction, especially if you already have an exchange account set up. Merchants can also avoid CC fees and chargebacks.   2 billion people don’t have access to banking services.   They can use bitcoin wallets to store and transfer money as long as they have cell phones.  It’s entirely a network effect.  More adoption, higher price, less volatility, more ability to spend/receive without ever touching the traditional fiat system.  But the protocol already works today.   There’s no 10 year wait for that.

It’s volatile but not that volatile.   It doesn’t swing 20% in 20 minutes.   Also if the market cap grows then the volatility will lessen.   I would say the trx fee and the confirmation wait times are more significant strains on practical use, but those are not important if you don’t require instant confirmation or f you’re transferring over $50 USD.  Furthermore you get the advantage of an immutable trx and you can cross international borders.   Another great use case is hodling.

The 51% attack is not really a huge threat because the community can always fork the chain.  I wouldn’t lose sleep over some major takeover occurring at a halvening.   Unprofitable miners shutting down has always been part of the protocol.  It was once profitable to mine BTC with old laptop CPUs.

The problem with “sticking to cash” is most currencies are unstable and decline in value over time.  Even the USD always slowly deflates.   Also cash can be stolen...much easier to secure crypto.  I don’t see why the banking the unbanked argument isn’t relevant.   If you have no way to store any money other than hoarding deflating paper in a developing country... Phone wallet seems smart.   You gotta have some way to store liquid assets that don’t get crushed by inflation.   And if you do need to move some around, the fees are usually less than $1.  I know this because I actually transact w BTC.
I love the protocol, the mining schedule, the hash rate, the security, and the reliability.   I love that it’s borderless and doesn’t involve banks.  (As far as we know). But the original point I was making is that the practical aspect of bitcoin can be demonstrated today.  Just point your phone wallet at a QR code and presto you can send money anywhere in the world.  Adoption is separate from practicality, although there’s clearly a network effect in play here.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:42:42
It depends on where you’re getting the power to mine the BTC but in general it costs $1,000s in power plus cost of mining equipment.  If the price of paper were comparable you would see the paper at Office Depot cost $1,000s.  It’s paper and it’s cheap.  Moreover most fiat is just digital anyway so it’s moot. Bitcoin cost far more to create than fiat but that’s part of the proof of work which is part of its value.  it’s better to talk about this intelligently rather than make your argument which quite frankly is just dead wrong.
What you can mention is the cost of government and banking infrastructure.  The cost of MC/Visa.  But not the cost of making paper.

If you put all your savings in BTC, then you’re investing your savings.  Have you not seen the price swings?
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:00:27
There’s the price of the coin and the price of electricity.   I don’t think the design is to put all miners into a loss.   The reward is also the minting process,  so when the reward halves the new supply also halves which should increase price.   
I do think in general hash would increase up until halvening then recede then start building again.  Of course some of the hash rate is technology based.  If they come out with faster chips that run off less juice that impacts hash rate as well.

That’s not really a problem.  If somebody accepts fiat then use Zelle or your debit card.  Nobody buys groceries with gold coins either.   That really has little to do with the strength, relevance, or practicality of BTC.   What matters is that the distributed ledger has 100% uptime and any person in the world with a cell phone can access it, which is actually not the case with Zelle, since that service requires a bank account too bad for the 2 billion humans without access to a bank.

Actually I wasn’t totally correct.  Currently BTC is created faster than USD, so holding $6400 is actually a growth in total purchasing power or market cap.   But there is a schedule to a finite 21 million, which is why ultimately if it stays at $6400 it loses.

Time and cost to produce are certainly part of the price equation.   This is why lobster cost more than steak.  But it’s more complex with BTC because the mining difficulty calibrates based on total hashpower.   If all the miners shut down, the cost to produce a bitcoin would be very low and you could mine on laptops.   So it’s a network effect.  As network grows, cost and price grow.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:12:08

One thing my boss would do is have one of our off duty cops stand in the office and he would get kids to sign restitution agreements based on how much he estimated they stole.  Some kids paid back $1,000s even though had they just denied, denied, denied they woulda been good cuz corporate policy was to not prosecute.  another classic way to burn big, disorganized companies is with straight up time card fraud.  Punch your coworker in on their off day.   depending on software this can be audited but I bet there are still plenty of disorganized organizations where it will work.

You should connect myether wallet to your ledger also.   But the best thing to do regarding recovery is test it.  Turn off your router and boot up Linux from usb.

When I worked at the movie theatre 10 years ago I would bring about $10k in cash to get an initial set of about 8 tills going.  4 customers paying with 20s is enough to change the 5th customers $100.  I would make hourly “pulls” and send wads hundreds 20s 50s to the back via pneumatic tube. The bills the cashiers ran out of were 5s and 1s.  They were instructed to put big bills in a lower locked compartment as it accumulated but they would always have plenty up top because they were busy serving an endless line of customers that often paid with cash.  
To steal money, you have to trick the point of sale system somehow, otherwise your register would come up “short”, management would review security tapes, and you would be done.  We started telling people up front that we’ve caught countless people stealing.  It actually made a huge difference.  People steal when they think they can get away with it.

Bernie’s main platform was taxpayer funded health care and education.  I think
It’s a favorable approach, but beyond funding / barriers still much to improve regarding education and health care.   Overall I’m
In favor of governance over health care.  In the future I think public education may be less important, but I see why someone attacking disparity and oppression would look at the classism and aristocracy that the university system  has created.   Bernie seems like a good guy to me.  He hates crooked bankers and bank bailouts, so I bet he would be in favor of bitcoin.

I don’t believe that a “free market” is the answer to everything.  In my view we need organization based on the will of the people.  You can call it “government” if you want.  Otherwise what’s to stop 1 man from polluting a river in the name of profit?  I guess in libertarian world you go shoot the guy?  Is that anarcho-cap?  I really don’t follow political labels.  I just know my beliefs. 
Bernie has a solid track record.  If you went full on libertarian with health care I don’t see how it’s any better than our current capitalist model.  People are still going to want health insurance.  Our FDA is corrupt.  So the answer is to get rid of it and let Big Pharma go unchecked?  I’m pretty open minded and I don’t trust my government, but I thought Sanders was a good candidate mainly because of his ideas on healthcare.   I thought the free college was actually old school because these days I’m more like F the university system... it’s mostly politics and football.   
Bernie is anti “favors for the rich”.     I agree with reducing the size, reach, and cost of government.  But I also agree with making sure there is as much fairness in the system as possible.  Based on the status of USA government in 2016, Bernie was a pretty good candidate.  Of course I believe it’s all mostly a charade and real power is banks, which is what bitcoin is up against.  So I don’t really care.  But still can’t believe they gave us Donald.

Sure if by private sector you mean the owners of the banks.  Central banks screw over the actual people that give fiat currency it’s value, the people that work for it to pay off BOTH their personal loans AND the government loans. (Taxes). Of course there’s no debt ceiling.  The debt will only continue to grow under the current system of central banking cartels and global warfare.  Central banks = government debt = enslaved workers and warfare.  All of politics is a joke to me, I only look at economics.   I only look at the banks.  Fractional reserve is criminal to me.  It’s creating money out of thin air; to me that’s counterfeit.  The whole fiat system to me is crooked.  You put your money in a bank and they lend out 90% of it while you work 30 years to buy a $200k house for $400k w $200 going right back to the bank.  This is all criminal.   It’s backed by police and military force and the government is forced to borrow so what to spend it on?  Medical?  Social?  Education?  Nope.  Warfare warfare warfare warfare.

The analogy is pretty straight forward.  A token of BTC can buy over $3k USD goods and services, but for most of those services you need to first convert to fiat currency.  It’s the same with bars of gold.  Buying with gold is not convenient, so you first convert to fiat.   However BTC is infinitely divisible and 100% digital, so I believe the convenience of payment part will work itself out.
