Hm, I can't find my source for that bit. I may have misread something or conflated him with Robert Mercer at some point. Thanks for bringing that to my attention. Edited comment.
It was probably this bit from my first link:

Not OP, but there's plenty. He ~~funded~~ worked with Cambridge Analytica/SCL &amp; owns Palantir (psyops firms spying on and manipulating people, stealing elections). He helped get Trump elected. Helped cause Brexit.

Assange has not even been charged. He's wanted _for questioning_.

Still, citations please.

I understand that. A transaction of 10k+ may be worth investigating but it's not reasonable grounds for suspecting anything. And one ought to be able to use bitcoins without being questioned about that, and he said he was questioned specifically about it, not just about making a large transaction.

You're missing the reason he was upset. Using bitcoin is _not_ grounds for reasonable suspicion, and he resents the implication. If people don't defend their privacy then people will soon lose the right to privacy. People should be able to do things like use bitcoin without being questioned about it.
