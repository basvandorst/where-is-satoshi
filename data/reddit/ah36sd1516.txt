Most laws don't have AML which make it insanely trivial to track down every person breaking said laws.
even if you want to launder your money and use local bitcoins and manage to actually get non-counterfeit cash/not get robbed/actually find someone to cash out with -- great, now you have USD.  Now you have to launder it before you can use it.  and now you've increased your risk if you ever get caught since you broke even more laws.  5 years in jail just became 30.

You can't turn your BTC into $, or precious metals though.  you can only buy whatever people sell for BTC, which is not many things.  There's no amazon for BTC, and websites that claim to convert btc&lt;-&gt;usd get shut down because they violate various TOS's of the sites, if not laws.
all those people spending thousands of dollars on miners will never be able to get their ROI

"a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter."
Seems pretty cut and dried to me
Mining = Creates units of convertible virtual currency (bitcoin)
If you sell your bitcoin for real currency, you are a money transmitter.


That's not how it reads.  MtgGox does not absolve you of responsibility.  MtGox _FACILITATES_ you selling to ANOTHER PERSON.  You are _NOT_ selling to MtGox.  
This is how the exchanges THEMSELVES manage to not get shut down instantly.
NOBODY wants to take that responsiblity

"a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter."
Take it up with fincen.  Mining is creating bitcoin.  Selling your bitcoin for $ is money transmission.  Trying to buy gold/silver/etc is also money transmission.  About the only thing you can buy is "services" aka things you can't resell
They killed it bro
I hope asicminer isn't based in the USA at all, or they'll be shut down fast

I only hope the requirements aren't so complex and expensive that it makes any fully legal/licensed exchanges impossible
thanks for your viewpoint

The problem with


Is that using MtGox doesn't get me real or virtual goods or services.  It gets me real currency.
I don't think that applies to anyone who sells BTC for $, regardless of its person to person, or through an exchange, or however. 
That is for people who use BTC to buy things like say, electronics, etc.
but things like Gold/silver/etc which can store as a easily traded store of value, don't count as a "real good or service", they count as an alternative to physical currency.. i don't recall the name
Maybe you are right and exchanges take this into account, but it would require the exchange to have all their AML/Know your customer for every person who buys/sells.  I dont know if any do this.  And i'm still not sure if a miner has to register somehow and say "I sell through Exchange XYZ who does this shit".  
I doubt miners can get away with 50,000$/year profit (i.e. asic miners) without some form of registration

Hmm.. is there any precedent for this kind of market / service that MtGox/etc fill?
Maybe FOREX exchanges who move money between currenecies, but the people using it don't actually see who is buying from them / who they are buying from?
i'm slightly more optimistic after reading some replies

I hope you're right.  But they did not explicitly say you CAN trade with an exchange and cash out.  This still seems to be a grey area.
They said
* You can trade BTC for goods and services (real or virtual)
* If you mine, you need a license/register to trade BTC for USD person-to-person 
AFAIK they said nothing explicitly about BTC-&gt;USD via an exchange, or for that matter, USD-&gt;BTC.

You cash out any significant amount of money from an exchange, you will have to account for it.
If you try to lie and say "b-but i &lt;sold services here&gt; you'll have to prove it, and meanwhile they have full documentation you bought &lt;GPU/ASIC/etc&gt; mining equipment here".  they will also have IP logs (unless you use Tor) and addresses of you mining on the block chain unless you solo mine BTC which requires you have to Terahashes of power and also means you're going to try and cash out 5, 6 figures a year
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:55:50
I think at a minimum all miners should use Tor or similar, and as many wallets as is practical
solo mining is always the best, but difficult for BTC

Come on, you known just as well as I do that people GPU mining were ordering dozens and dozens of GPUs.  Thousands of dollars on a single model of hardware.  You think that's not hard to figure out.
Any tiny mining ops made up of less than maybe 6 GPUs will be fine.  There are thousands of people running 20+ GPUs at once.  
Not to mention every person who bought from BFL/Avalon/etc.  No other use for their FPGA/ASIC products
