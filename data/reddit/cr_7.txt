What is your walk-up song at Bristol going to be?

If Brad still hasn't bought his tank yet, maybe Arnold can help him out!

Have a moment of déjà vu? ;-)

Hey Alex, the ["toilet paper" incident]( back at Bristol was one of the funniest things I've seen this year in NASCAR. How many followers did you gain on Twitter after that race? Thanks for the AMA!

Justin Bieber ruined her for me, haha.

IRP losing it's Nationwide race to Indy was so unfortunate. That place always had some great racing. More money at Indy though...

Haha, I was one of the 10,000. Hopefully you'll get some more followers with this Bitcoin sponsorship! You ever used Reddit before today?

We'd occasionally do this on the last lap if the other person was way behind.

Alex, you've just gained a new fan. I know the schedule is full and there are political issues with SMI/ISC regarding scheduling changes, but I would love to see a couple more short tracks on the schedule. Martinsville is my favorite track.

They actually race each other every week. Josh Wise has ran the Dogecoin car on three different occasions this year already and will run it again this fall at Talladega. So if you're looking for a Bitcoin vs. Dogecoin scenario, Talladega would definitely be the one to choose!

Do you have a celebrity crush?

&amp; Pretty sure I'd want to kill him. My roommate and always used to stick to short 20-30 lap races. Even so, sometimes half an hour would pass and we still wouldn't have finished one race yet because one of us kept restarting.

Reddit is really awesome once you get used to it and find the subreddits you are interested in. Extremely time-consuming place though.

Who do you usually seek out for advice in the garage? 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:14:23
Do you follow a particular workout regime to stay in shape for the races? 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:30:02
can help you out! lol

Bristol. Coincidentally, that's also the race where the idea of sponsoring Josh Wise started.
Edit - words

I know teams and drivers would disagree with me, but I don't see any "prestige" in Nationwide racing at Indy (I can at least see it in Cup). It's a lower-tiered series racing on a historical track. And letting them race there makes it worse for the Cup race, IMO. You have sit through two races on a track where stock cars don't race well.
