Can confirm.

I am hopeful bordering on expectant.
If it weren't for interference from the Central Banks, I would imagine BTC would have already taken off in a bigger way than has been seen to date.
But I feel like the CBs have been painting themselves into a corner for nearly 100 years and it seems/feels like they are about out of corner. I think the attempts at "stable coins" is an attempt to build a bridge out of the corner but it's all based off the same broken system they have abused to death.
Crypto, BTC in particular, has been struggling forward and innovating at a pace that makes fiat look so dumb by comparison.
Every bit of greater adoption robs a little adoption from the CBs/fiat. There will come a point of critical mass (we may not even realize when it happens) and that scale will tip.
Considering the nature of BTC, the more of the global economy that moves onto BTC the more it will explode. And, considering how little of the global economy is currently in BTC and the cap on BTC... Well... Do the math.
I suppose the CBs could still pull off a hat trick but it's not all within their control. The right sort of economic destabilization could push a lot to crypto at once. I.e. the crash of the dollar would do it, I believe.
As gets said many times daily, BTC/Crypto is a long game currently. But when it takes off... Look out.

Give me one hard fork and I will kill half of it.

It really starts to tickle after a fortnight or so.

This. Besides, if they tried to ban it in a country like the US, people have enough resources to go underground with it.
It would take a global effort to quash it to stand a chance of success.
Besides that, a lot of the financial establishment is hedging on BTC. That's not the act of someone looking to ban a thing.
