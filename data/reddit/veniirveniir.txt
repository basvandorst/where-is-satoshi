It is off-chain.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:02:07
Lightning Network is off-chain, so Bitcoin doesn't have smart contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:00:34
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:12:11
It's never cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:18:54
It's not profitable to mine bitcoins anymore. Though, you can mine altcoins through nicehash and get paid in bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:41:49
I don't get your question.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:51:36
It's FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:54:45
Buy graphics cards and mine altcoins instead.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:14:36
How is Litecoin less centralized? Do you mean less DEcentralized?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:13:36
5$ is insane!
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:17:11
Why would you cash out back to fiat? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:18:54
Bitcoin will not take over the world economy in 2020. It's not ready for mass adoption at all.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:02:41
Except Bitcoin Cash doesn't have high fees, slow transaction times, Segwit, RBF, a "Core" team that chooses what will happen to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:51:10
IMO using segwit still doesn't make the fees low enough.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:17:31
Gdax is an exchange, not a wallet. Never leave your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:41:06
Care to explain why?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:07:43
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:43:00
Samourai or Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:23
Nicehash is apparently hacked. Feelsbadman
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:10:24
That is coinbase's fault. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:42:49
Why use Bitcoin Cash instead of Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:57:10
What's the hashrate?
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:25:18
A paper wallet is just as safe, just not as convenient.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:11:44
Why are you spreading FUD? The money was not lost. The Bitcoin.com wallet uses the same address for both BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:55:00
No, just bought more.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:24:10
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:06:02
Nice try irs 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:26:34
You can lower the fees.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:58:33
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:46:24
Electrum is for bitcoin, not Ether.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:35:03
Nice try irs
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:54:19
Look for a wallet.dat file.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:19:30
Try out Nicehash if you are going to mine on a computer. It mines the most profitable coin for you and converts it to btc.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:42:28
7 bucks transaction fee? You can do 40sat/byte and still get confirmed fairly quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:28:16
You can do 20sat/byte. No need to pay 5 dollars in fees.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:52:19
Use RBF. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:32:56
Import the private key from the wallet.dat file into a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:00:34
Lightning Network or increased blocksize.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:43:33
Breadwallet for iPhone, Mycelium for Android.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:02:35
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:18:54
Stop asking this question all the time. You have already asked it 5+ times.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:48:10
LTC and ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:50:00
The dip is now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:04:13
I want bigger blocks, but not bcash
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:14:22
Stop spreading lies.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:03:40
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:31:06
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:54:13
You can set your own fee if you are not in a hurry.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:16:08
Use Replace-by-fee.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:40:51
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:23:07
Games on Steam.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:56:44
You can choose a fee yourself.

@_date: 2017-10-22 15:18:36
Thanks for the quick answer. :)
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:43:07
I got disappointed when i read the article. :(
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:12:47
The same place you bought them.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:21:34
I have been experiencing lag with mycelium today as well.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:44:22
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:12:38
Hopefully, yes.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:10:39
Yes, when using Electrum you control your private keys.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:40:49
Thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:39:28
Mycelium for Android.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:15:34
Okay, thanks. :)
