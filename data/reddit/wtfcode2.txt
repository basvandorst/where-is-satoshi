Which is exactly why I would. Though I wouldn't want to deal with the support side of it when I start running the ponzi down, nor the impending 'I'm going to kill you, then cut off the ear of your child, and rape your wife' anger that those idiots have, which is a whole other legal tidbit.

Some of the fervor is for adoption, others is for the 'I don't have a credit card or bank account' crowd, and some more for the 'pseudo-anonymity' crowd. 
For me, I just have BTC sitting around not doing anything, so might as well ask if it would be possible to spend it on something I want without all the hassle of an exchange.
As far as the 'gave in' quote, I wasn't reluctant at all to use USD, I just had poor word choice in my comment. I love DI, and actually listen to it everyday, and even get some radiotunes in as well (soundtracks are coolio.)

If you continue to invest in cloud mining sites, you will inevitably lose all that you invested.
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:44:55
Funny you should ask, because it looks like you've asked on another post.
Why not do your own research instead of asking others.
lemmings follow other lemmings, and when the leader jumps off a cliff, the herd jumps off as well.
Nobody here is an investment professional, and it seems like you should just keep your BTC instead of investing it in places where others suggest. If I told you to invest in my lucrative site, would you?
I don't actually have a site, but the point is to do your own research and to never listen to what others have to say about positive integrity (always pays me on time, gives errors in my favor...) of a site....
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:20:02
Don't think I need to since you removed the post. :|
You sir are an idiot for investing a clear ponzi from the start.
If you really want me to elaborate...
'Cloud mining' services start to shutdown, and slow payments when the ponzi is about to go belly up, they have paid the first investors back, and maybe a few levels down the chain back, but do not go much further, leaving the end links (you and most others invested, the idiots,) with 0 payouts. They try to leave with no trace at all, or start winding down the whole 'support process,' hoping they can fade away into the background.
If you werent an idiot, you would know that there is no such thing as cloud mining, nor is there any such thing as a ROI for any type of 'internet mining' (mining using hardware not your own (or hosted by yourself,) but getting a payout for 'purchasing' the hardware.)
Bitcoin is *NOT* a get rich quick scheme, which people who invest (like yourself) seem to think. I hope you won't be part of the idiot cycle that tends to happen where you will just invest in the next 'good looking cloud mining site,' otherwise I say good luck to you in losing all of your BTC.

steambitshop.com has a lot more items, and generally follows with all the sales; I see no upside to this; in addition 50 and 33% off coupled with your comment about legitimately gained keys makes it seems like they aren't, and you obtained them nefariously.

More ponzi crap and referrals to bring more people in.
This is why people are eating their own shit, because they aren't smart enough to know better. Bitcoin (and by extension, bitcoin) should be used by people who have an IQ above 100; as opposed to currently where it seems the IQ of the users is well below 70.

I think you are failing to see how the majority of the people get get scammed due to ponzi, never learn after the first mistake, thinking high payouts mean something.
Having said that, those investors only got into bitcoin because of the 'I can make X amount from nothing, sign me up' mentality.
If I had no morals, I would open a ponzi site as well, idiots never learn.

Been done with Twitter, and Reddit more recently.
A problem with doing a command stack with blockchain technology is that on each zombie, they have to have the bitcoin software along with the blockchain. If the constant connections don't set something off, the disk usage would. 
(I am aware if you make a rootkit advanced enough you can effectively hide the files, processes and network activity)
The main problem is that if you issue enough 'commands' (transaction in reality) the IP can be pinpointed.
You would be better off using a FastFlux network DNS structure to send commands than blockchain technology.

That ONLY shows the 5 PH/s they bought from BitMain. That does NOT show anything related to scrypt mining, which is where it all started; and where a lot of the 'hashlets' are in (scrypt not SHA256.)
Those are clearly S4's running; okay, good for them.
If that is all they have to show, then it really is a ponzi scheme; because that 5 PH/s wasn't ordered early on, but was well after the hashlet introduction.
Since they refuse to do anything about SCRYPT mining; you can determine they ARE running a ponzi, using money from new investors, to pay back the old, and the 5 PH/s is just to quicken the pace they can pay back, and make it look like they aren't.
Paycoin itself is full of flaws, centralization, and misuse of the word 'partnerships.'
Edit, more info:
It should be noted that they kept saying that the pool you pick on your hashlet is the one that it is mining on; that was then turned around and now it is wide open that it doesn't matter what pool you pick, they screenscrape the payouts for the day on X pool and pay you that rate.
The VaultBreakers NEVER were manufactured and never were going to be. This will absolutely be proven by the end of the month, when their timelimit expires on when they can deliver.
Their "Q and A" are pure BS, since it isn't a question answer session, but a 'this question only promotes GAW, lets do it.'
Josh is full of ego, saying that hashtalk will crash Rackspace and the whole 'we crashed Authy' stuff... If you truly believe that what they are doing is legit; then by all means waste your money on a loan to which will NOT get paid back, and does NOT collect interest.
More edits:
Also, from the apparent failures of their front AND backends, they do NOT have a development site or anything to test new features. A lot of the issues they have had and are having would have easily been caught if they used a development branch. Speaking of branches, I highly doubt they use GIT. From the access that I had from the ZenController thing, they just copy/paste repos, and change words.
Nothing of this is right, and at this point I don't feel bad if poor saps go for GAW. It is obvious they can't do basic fact checking and math.

If someone says something about their 'datacenter' (either the zen side or the one with the racks and racks)
for the Zen images, that is not enough hardware, space or power to support current hashlet rates.
For the racks and racks; there are NO power conduits, cables or anything BESIDES the CASES (important to note, as metal cases are far cheaper than the entire miner itself, saving costs for that picture) of the miners. That warehouse was a shipping (more than likely receiving address from Zeus, since they never fabricated any chips or PCB's {Subnote, the VB's never were going to be fabricated, and never officially existed, chip specs never came to light...})
The old "Bring back ROI" slogan was dropped; and by this point we know that ROI meant something different to Josh than the people.
The "1 MH/s" contracts are (or should say were as they were called out on it several times) really 1.6 to get that higher payout than the other pools.
If the "Big contracts" thing was true, they would flaunt it left and right (more or less an application form or some form to submit to strike talks.)
The fact is that GAW is so shady, and I don't and won't feel bad for the lemmings who follow his every tweet and take every word he says to the grave, because the math is there, the logic is there, and common sense is there; but they either don't get it, or are too absorbed to understand.
Subnote... In the PayBase announcement, he mentioned "partnership" again... Not only does GAW NOT have a partnership with PayPal and Shopify, they are using the BITCOIN name to say they have a partnership. ANY legal team (which I am not a lawyer) would tell you that they cannot do that, or with the whole "NDA" thing with Walmart and Target.
The fact that law enforcement hasn't taken care of these idiots amazes me... The fact that people here in the crypto scene are so stupid to fall for this crap... Why should I be involved with idiots who can't think for themselves...
Edit: Should be noted that "PayCoin" will have a BTC interface, and be 100% centralized. Not only do THEY solely control transactions, but they are the exchange and set the rate from PayCoin-&gt;bitcoin.
The rebrand from Hashcoin to Paycoin is ironic... you aren't hashing, you are paying them... Being the school lunch bully...

The main question is, does coinfire have the server? If so, it is trivial to:
1. Move to a new registrar and a new domain, at least temporary. Domains are cheap.
1. Move way from Cloudflare; another like Staminus or the like can actually eat up attacks. Cloudflare is known to be bad. 
On the other hand, if they don't have the server (access to files or just locked out):
1. They need to publicize everything they have (any documents or the like) because inevitably it will be released by whoever now 'owns' it.
1. give the community as much info as possible. Otherwise it will be a festival of "inside job" and other boundless claims.

1. It will prevent the 'gavinfork' from accepting an oldfork chain if it becomes longer. If several are placed as intervals, the risk of 51% is significantly decreased, as people would be on various checkpoints.
2. Changing the protocol version (and enforcing it) would not allow the forks to talk to each other.
3. A little extra code can be put in place as sort of a buffer zone for those 100 blocks
There are also other quirks that one can do, such as setting -blockversion or modifying the way version checks are done at the transaction level.

Everyone who says this is just WRONG.
Not only are cold wallets not a real thing, but they are not offline. The only thing a 'cold wallet' is, is on an address which the signing key is not connected to the internet. 
The address itself that houses the coins is still on the network, and it is trivial to initiate a private key brute force.
So yes, you can be 'hacked' with a cold wallet.
Now for the haters saying 'it will take more energy than the universe has.' That is also wrong. It is based on chance, which a lot of people still don't understand. I could find the private key in seconds, or in that millions of years, or any time between.
Multisig on the other hand just multiplies the complexity to get the keys as you not only have to find m keys, but the chance of finding those keys in a TIMELY fashion is unlikely.

You don't seem to understand the definition of chance, or the idea of probability.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:01:55
So is your throwaway.
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:39:04
It depends if the keys you are putting together are WIF (start with a 5) or the actual ECDSA hex-encoded private keys.
You can't just add two WIF keys, but you can get the ECDSA private keys from them, and do whatever math you want on them to add then, and then make that into a valid WIF key.
Remember, all keys are, are points on a really large graph.

I don't work for anybody...
You haven't fixed half of the blockchain.info stuff, and the accusations comes from not only Coinkite being 14 X's ahead, but there are 5 sections, which nobody else has.
All of that, plus the recycled link, and Coinkites notoriety of vote manipulation.
Now, if you are fair and unbiased, you would do research on the wallets as opposed to the media.
You want things to fix, Fix what I stated in the linked topic, and all other suggestions.

Wasn't directed at OP of thread, just of the bitcointalk post; granted I didn't open the link.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:34:00
There are odds, which is the whole point, and that a cold wallet is just as hackable as any other wallet address.


Again, chance, so you cannot say that there is a guarantee that it will take that long.
It is possible and frankly people hiding behind the idea that it isn't possible or it will take too much time and energy are either full of themselves, or don't understand the idea of chance.
Yes it will take a lot of time an energy if it happens to be the last nonce tried for the key, but chance dictates each try has an equal opportunity to be the correct nonce.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:54:26
That is probably accurate, however I was pointing out that because people use the term 'cold wallet,' it does not mean that it 'unhackable.' It is just as hackable as any other address.

Shill account for another web wallet service...
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:27:29
Again, it is possible to; I'm not saying it is likely.
Very unlikely does not mean not possible.
If something has a probability of occurring that is greater than 0, then it is possible.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:23:58
Of course you don't report that you are doing it yourself.
Typical practice to make yourself look good when you are all covered in shit anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:29:26
That's not a private key though. That is a WIF key.

Pay, automatically, Developers.
Some words I never want to see as it becomes way too easy for those developers to ~~scam~~ scim more, or worse, all of users funds.
Now if it was default off, and you get a prompt when enabled, That's better, but implementing it default on, and at that, 1000 sat per transaction is too much. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:02:16
Seems like you've never gotten lucky in your life.

Java Runtime.exec. More and more EKs are running Flash if Java isn't available (what the 7.11, and all the other Color Rasters exploits that brought a lot of media attention.) Or you can take a time machine back to the EKs that used VBA to run stuff.
Have an RSS feed on the CVEs, and you quickly learn that you shouldn't have anything installed on any computer, online or offline. Most are due to weird edge cases, and overflows which developers really don't know how to stop.
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:16:50
Did you expect anything other than this?
If you did, you need to understand that **everything** GAW touches does not turn to gold, but turns to dust, crashes and is never fixed because nobody at GAW gives a shit.

What else are all those Art majors gonna do?
I guess they can be art hacks.

You will get it; but depending on which version of bitcoin core you got, could be hours, or possibly days before it shows up.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:13:51
Altcoins are far more profitable to mine in the short term, if you pick them right.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:33:46
You would get better experts by going on the bitcoin channel on freenode; where you can actually talk with the devs.

Quoted text, and I guess I made an Ass out of U and Me.

You are willing to spend 1 year + (more like 2 or more since you obviously are not a programmer,) with no pay, and programming 20 hour days, only to get hacked within the first week or shutdown due to regulation or just outright scam people.
You want technical bits for bitcoin? Why not look at the code and all the BIPs...
You want to know about the safety and security that banks have? By asking that, you are already going to fail. 
I'd gladly be the first to 'alpha test' your exchange. Just be aware that I'd take all that you had. If not me, then anyone else.
