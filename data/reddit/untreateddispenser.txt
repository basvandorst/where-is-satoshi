I was thinking if it didn’t go below 10 then that’s good cuz the last low was 9k. higher highs and higher lows...
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:16:58
yeah that’s what a lot of people did on 2013, 2014, and 2015. bitcoin price rn doesn’t even mean shit because bitcoin won’t be fully devolved till probably 2020-2022
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:55:55
march is when things will start picking up 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:59:45
and we didn’t did we
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:06:36
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:35:37
lmao I litterally feel the same way bitcoin will look like it’s going up and then all of a sudden boom back down 2,000$ and i’m just like “oh that’s cool, I don’t give a fuck anyways cuz I wasn’t planning on pulling out till the end of this year 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:17:12
bitcoin and everything thing else will be up by march. ITS NOT EVEN FEBRUARY FOR 10 more days!
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:43:18
it’s january u relize these past couple weeks look like less than a centimeter on the yearly chart 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:07:37
it’s fucking annoying right. like why can’t these dum mother fuckers stop selling and just fucking buy and we can all get rich god damn 
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:42:01
have you heard about sumokoin? what do u think about it? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:09:44
yes and everyday we get more people that are planning to buy and hold that’s why the price will continue to go up. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:57:02
tonight at 11:37 pm
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:07:07
ya it’s fuckin gay
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:08:53
lol u seem like a fagget
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:05:46
fuck. but it’s gonna go back up u know it
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:38:28
I know but I feel like i should wait till it’s at 20k for me to take out my initial investment, so I would still have like half a bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:12:27
golds not a functioning currency people can’t just easily buy stuff with it all the time just like bitcoin but it still has value so why couldn’t bitcoin do the same? and use the other coins as the currency but keep ur money stored in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:12:38
ya more like 12500 RIGHT NOW
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:47:50
yea just wait when bitcoin hits 30k u gonna be sucking my cock
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:26:37
I bought in at 7200 and again at 9600 so I just don’t feel like it would go down past that you know?
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:29:11
snapchat duhhhh
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:20:55
when do u think it’ll hit 25k
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:23:27
i’m just worried people are thinking bitcoin can’t possibly go any higher and they think it’s going to crash and that makes them sell which makes the price crash, i’ve put 75% of my money into
bitcoin at 7200, 9600 and 10,500 so I really hope i’m not trusting in bitcoin at the wrong time
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:12:23
haha it’s bout to hit 12 k rn
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:45:37
it’s already correcting 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:27:43
so the support lines are where a lot of people bought and are holding?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:13:20
 was just about to post a question like this
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:13:00
LETS GOOOO
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:21:33
will it for sure go In though, can I leave the browser on my phone and it’ll go in eventually?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:31:03
it’ll be 25k sooner than that i’d say
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:34:38
same... mostly into ltc though, I think it could easily hit 1000$ in the next 2 months 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:51:00
I have .5 of bitcoin now, I put .15 into ripple so I have 1900 ripple now, and I have a good amount of litecoin so i feel like i’m good 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:28:24
I used to be and then I put in half of money (6200$) when it was at 7200 and at 9600 and now I’ve made over double my money plus more from putting in 450$ in litecoin at 86$ i’ve now doubled my money with that too. don’t keep thinking about what you’ve missed out on and jump on the train while u still have a chance!
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:11:24
lol I told u
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:37:27
so what are you saying... don’t buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:46:45
well I didn’t get this money legally anyways
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:19:19
bro it’ll be more than 20k by christmas i’m thinking
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:46:23
tried to post it this morning lmao
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:33:26
ok but now gdax is showing 16,485$ and coinbase is showing 16,461
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:09:47
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:38:28
dumbass i’m saying it’s been going down more than staying steady the past 3 hours
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:17:10
why does the price on coinbase say 16,460 but on gdax it’s 16,330
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:21:32
yea but it’s ben stable all day since the morning going up from 13,800 to 15,800 and it just dropped again back to 13,800-14
 I mean 14,800-1500——^
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:39
I just tried to ask this and the bot wouldn’t let me ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:37:41
get ur bread up 50$ worth of bitcoin ain’t shit
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:28:29
what do u mean 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:39:30
bitcoin isn’t going to just crash now, a bunch of shit has been happening and with christmas coming up and the bitcoin cash being put on coinbase caused a lot of people (mostly the ones that are new at this) to sell and possibly lose faith in bitcoin. but after a run up from 12k to 19k in less than 2 weeks, this is expected but bitcoin is way stronger than any other pussy alt coin, so HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:10:08
yea but it’s not gonna nose dive. it will be back to 20k sometime soon after new years
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:39:51
now ether is going up and litecoin isn’t ???
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:45:36
Lol stfu u don’t know me, i’ve already made over double my money and i’ve been in this 20 days, that doesn’t mean i haven’t known about bitcoin the past 3 years
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:11:06
yes it’s been slowly going up since it hit 11,300 and dropped to 9 having a higher low each day and a higher high each day too so it seems like it’s being steady
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:49:53
I feel the same way man
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:01:51
what if I have no set yearly income, i’m 18 again and I saved up the money I put in over 4 years. but i’ve heard that after u get any amount over 10k in your bank account the irs will look into u
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:33:52
what u mean popped up another 50$
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:17:45
got it ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:08:55
is a gold a functioning currency? why does it have value? why do people buy it? because it’s a good store of value
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:01:23
what chart?
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:31:20
people are selling right now because they want to before this tax season ends, its the end of the year 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:25
if it bought at 7200, 9600 and 10,600 should I have sold and re bought? (I put in a total of 6200, and I my money was at like 14,000 earlier today)
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:02:01
fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:38:13
the lightning network will change that just wait 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:19:10
yea u don’t seem like someone I should take advice from
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:39:34
50% but i’m only 19 and only had 15k to my name, I put in about 8000$ 1000$ into ether and 500 into litecoin, the rest in bitcoin, and i’m up to 15k on coinbase now
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:10:26
yes but also have you thought about how many more people know what bitcoin is now,  and how evolved it has become since 2013-2014. so many people who are invested in bitcoin believe it is the future. this is why i’m skeptical on thinking this a bubble, we really don’t know what will happen because times have changed alot and so has technology and there’s way more people in the world than there was 5 years ago
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:35:29
that’s a good idea, I have a .76 of a bitcoin and I only payed 6200$ for it. should I use this same strategy?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:08:28
obviously it crashes and then goes back up.... buy the dips!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:09:11

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:49:17
yeah wtf
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:00:47
Lol ok ok thanks for the intellectual response ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:56:50
I know exactly what u mean, everyone just needs to stick together and hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:10:11
fuck u
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:14:00
what does that mean exactly. what is volume 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:04:14
my friend has 24 bitcoins and was at 500k when the price was over 18k. i’m not new at this i’ve known about this for the past 2 years and just never decided to put money in until it was at 7200
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:02
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:12:15
hmmmm so u think the next few weeks coming will be good or bad for bitcoin now that bitcoin cash is on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:04:22
do u by any chance know any exchange that’s allowing btc to xrp exchange or ltc to xrp?
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:51:41
i’m 18 I put in 7500$ , have no job, have had multiple jobs, and now my moneys up to 20k so what do u think
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:57:15
it doesn’t even say there’s any pending transactions, I tried to buy it again after and it still doesn’t say anything.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:29:22
u don’t know shi
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:38:07
how long will the fork last u think? .... if it happens
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:15:07
there’s more people on here to give there input
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:10:07
the fact that u can’t re buy ur bitcoin that u bought at a cartain price after they sent back ur money and cancelled the purchase means coinbase is part of the reason the other part is my bank cancelling my card and sending me a new one without telling me
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:58
same problem what the fuck is going on
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:51:03
I mean most likely there’s gonna be another dip before it just goes up to 10k
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:04:25
wow they did thanks.  fuck wells fargo i’m getting a new bank 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:27:28
literally did the same thing ended up buying 3000$ worth at 6150
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:12:52
my question is still should I just close my bank account so that I the transaction doesn’t go through and just buy again in the dip? having bitcoin at 7200 just seems dumb when it’s gonna go below that again
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:08:59
I fucked up and bought 3k worth at 7200 should I just close my bank account so the transaction gets cancelled and just wait for another dip, I think it could go in the 6-7k range most likely 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:46:13
also I just went ahead and said fuck it and bought 3200$ worth of bitcoin at 7200 since the next drop won’t be for a while and i’m not gonna be able to get what I payed for originally ��. should I just sell when it gets to the next high and re buy again when it goes down since it will probably go down to around 6500 next
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:23:45
bitcoin is a huge pump and dump scheme lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:24:00
be ready for the pump part again
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:18:47
u don’t think about how long i.t takes. after it breaks 8200 it’s going to 7200 no doubt.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:21:40
my guess, 6500 will be the bottom
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:47:38
could you buy any at 0$??
