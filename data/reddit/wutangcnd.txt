That's just it, Its so hard to imagine BTC actually being used for large sums. I want it to happen, don't get me wrong, but is it really possible?

Just weird seeing stuff like this 20mins from your house
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:31:21
Ok interesting, thanks. Is it sinple do make a double move like that? Make a transaction, then "dump" remaining into a other wallet?

Reasearch friend. Research before making random comments and claims. He filed for a chapter 11 (or something along those lines) which basically allows you time to liquidate finds. Most rich people don't just have massive bank accounts with all of their money. That's why it's called net worth. The media and a bunch of idiots ln social media made it into this big thing of "ohh Durr Durr 50 cent is poor lllolollol" which couldn't further from the truth.

Apparently I have too little of an amount to transfer... This is not reassuring. Thanks copay.

I have a little amount of btc, very little. And currently minus as I bought at ath. I bought a little more at a much lower price last week. Very close to breaking even right now. My btc is in a non segwit wallet, I want to just hodl this little amount. Should I leave it there or transfer to samourai (using profit to pay transaction fee) when I go +?
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:57:45
Thanks for always doing this for us!

I don't see what, could be bothering you.

@_date: 2017-12-26 00:51:16
Seems useful. I'll definitely look at it!

Man you need to chill out. It's obviously a joke.

I wish there was a way to transfer without fees considering I just bought into btc about 6 weeks ago and have little invested
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:24:07

I've got a copay wallet, how can I transfer to samourai?
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:49:52
What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:32:38
No... Tried googling it.

Hey! Not all redragon boards are cheap and shitty! I made mine great imo :P
[First was a switch swap](
[second was detachable cable mod]( , this mod was really fun and made all the difference. Not only is the cable not centered anymore but I can use custom cables.
[I also sanded off the logo seen here](

Good luck, hopefully our dummy PM isn't there. He'll probably be with all the baby scientists.

if BTC hits 50k Ill make $250, TO THE MOOOON

Bitcoin is supposed to be used as a currency yet nobody wants to use it. Is hodling and using it as a long term investment not sort of against the whole idea?
I'm genuinely asking.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:24:52
Where did the value come from if everyone is holding?
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:18:45
I mean, how do you get it into say, your samurai wallet
