No the transaction is instant. First confirmation takes 10 minutes and you would need a computational monster to defraud double-spend the $1 purchase

I think they are probably just swamped. Possibly only a 2 person team so they are probably back logged with new account requests.. Give it some time..
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:22:05
Amen brother!
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:49:10
Hey this sounds interesting.. Any more details? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:28:53
Throw enough money at anything and it can be manipulated
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:03:41
you will give him US$21 equivalent for that?? :O
damn you must be loaded
@_date: 2013-12-29 13:21:57
Errr actually they convert to fiat straight away so aren't exposed to price volatility.. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:55:32
Great interview.. Good for newbies to get into bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:18:55
errr.. their payment overhead is 2% (credit card charges) and their profit margin with this current payment system is 2%.. if they can cut out their dependence on credit cards, their margin increases to 4% -&gt; a doubling, in other words

Nice work man - keep at it!
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:08:53
Can't wait.. Two brainy people and this genius invention. Feeling very twitchy leaving coins on a computer.. Can't wait..

Hey fellow Aussie :)
CoinJar is good but takes a while to set up and deposit funds due to many  many security procedures
Bit Trade Australia is easy to use but you have to make a physical deposit at a bank and they are a bit pricey compared to CoinJar
Quickest way is to use LocalBitcoins
I have had no issues acquiring bitcoins

says zero bro.. sorry for your loss
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:37:04
Convert the free to Dogecoin and be a Dogecoin millionaire 
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:25:21
man that's exactly what it is.. what a con: the guy who made it up gets all the coins and his whole setup is parasitic on the block chain network
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:30:39
man I lol'd hard at this!
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:32:08
Nah that's easily negated - the rate of adoption of bitcoin (and thus demand) is greater than the rate of creation of new coins. So for purely the reason you describe, bitcoin and it's mining don't produce an inflatory effect
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:00:45
my thoughts as well
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:25:14
Nah if the economy tanks,  bitcoin will too.. It's considered a high risk investment so speculators will dump it at the first sign of greater trouble 
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:57:28
Do it man - you won't regret it.. It'll pay off more than anything else at the moment. And there is no better time to invest than the present.
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:16:54
Pretty significant news
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:25:29
they are an established business with a good reputation.. slight difference to the type you describe
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:50:42
Less talk,  more shipment of trezors
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:15:59
Hold.. No regrets YOLO
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:55:54
Jesus this man must have testicles the size of watermelons to risk doing this
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:21:18
mining should be centralised if you ask me -&gt; it promotes efficiency in the system.. if you had every Tom / Dick and Harry running their own amateur mining operation with their their regular PCs, it would be wasteful compared to what's happening now.. the migration to ASICs just fosters efficiency
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:36:23
Yep definitely... This is bait for people looking for a robust, secure way of storing their coins.. I have to wait until they release to the public as I didn't want to spend a whole coin for the pre-order
EDIT: I would pay up to $300 for something like the trezor.. For support, hard work and of course what the thing does
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:19:07
lol what an idiot.. "puzzles!"
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:41:02
They'll jump in sure enough - the whole concept of bitcoin is a shock to the system for someone less computer literate..
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:34:39
One day, I bet hardware wallets themselves are going to be churned out as accessories when bitcoin becomes more mainstream... Just a thought - there a whole new inductry of design up ahead..
