The BTC chain would need to be changed to have more coins and then everyone would need to agree to use the new chain.  It technically would not need to be forked but if this ever happened it would most likely be a hard fork as there will be many people opposing the change.

I can't say 100% but here are educated guesses.
1) straight fishing; they don't have any idea that you know anything about BTC and/or Coinbase
  They are hoping that you will just click the link where they can either infect you or just get your personal info.
2) aggraget data collectors (Equifax)  created a comprehensive profile of you then got hacked!
3) YOU! You might have click a link last (week/month/year) and accidently leaked them this inform and they are finally targeting you for attack.
4) an acquaintance (friend/family/enemy) is attacking you.
I don't see any personal identifying information in the initial text so I am willing to guess that you got mass texted. Unless you can think of a risky click this is not targeted.
PM me if you have any additional questions.

BTC mining has been unprofitable many times before and this has never happened, in fact it has simply lead to an increase in value.  There is also a fundamental flaw in his understanding of a 51% attack.  51% attacks are not trivial.

Yeah, the wallstreet Bros, FUDers, and Luddites feel emboldened and flock to the subreddit spouting irrational and illogical statements because of the drop.  But the drop has no impact whatsoever to the functionality of the bitcoin network.  If the bitcoin network has 1,000TH or .001TH the functionality is exactly the same. 
It is important to note that Bitcoin == blockchain, and bitcoin == BTC.

There is also the silent majority (?) That understands that big B Bitcoin is a protocol, like HTTPS, SFTP, or SMTP.  
They have a grasp on the fact that this is a digital version of the technology known as money.  
They know more than buzzwords, they understand what the block height is and how it relates to the coinbase.  They are happy to hear of new BIPs. They understand that any transaction that is executed by the network by definition is a valid transaction.
Maybe it is not a silent majority, but if you are right about the three groups, at some point the only people here will be the group I mentioned.

Yeah, given there is already adoption via necessity in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and to a degree Iran, I don't see Bitcoin ever really having a low evaluation for the long run.  
There are a bunch of Luddites that have skin in the old financial system and refuse to have the basic understanding of technology that is money.  They we're born on third and are pissed off they were not born with the home run.
Bitcoin is the first truly digital money that is decentralized, censorship resistant, permissionless currency.  99.99% of people don't understand the gestalt impact of what Bitcoin is.
Americans don't understand the razors edge the USD is on.  Saudi Arabia has already said if Congress retaliates they will not hesitate to take the sale of oil off the USD.

That is not why it has value.  The simple act of printing it does not give it value.

With no evidence whatsoever, I maintain that DARPA created Bitcoin. 
I know DARPA evaluated the sale on Monsanto to the German company.  The interview on APM market place ( forgot who it was ) discussed how DARPA does extensive threat analysis on the craziest things.  He talked about how bird migrations can impact the health of forests that leads to xyz.
If they looked at the resolution of the financial crisis they saw how wallstreet and the Fed were and continue to be too big to fail.  The way our government is being financially irresponsible growing the deficit at breakneck speeds is an absolute threat to America and Democracy. 
I could see a world where these threats we're identified by the best of the best, the most patriotic Americans in the highest levels of the government. They handed it off to DARPA, DARPA and the Pentagon would know the paramount importance of absolutely secrecy, the foresight to create and stick to a pseudonym, and the fundamental need for the project to be open source for it to be adopted.
Literally 0 evidence and likely at least a million reasons why it cannot be, but I like this elegant explanation.

Going out to eat seafood with friends is generally not a small expense. Pick up a big lobster and you can tell a few stories about big lobsters. In the British coastal cities more than 100 years ago, large lobsters were particularly disgusted. why? It's very simple - too much production. At that time, the traffic was inconvenient, and the lobster produced in the coastal cities was particularly large. The only local people who could consume it were locals. So even prisoners and orphans can eat big lobsters. The servant will even sign a written agreement with the owner to ask the owner not to give him more than two lobsters a week. Later, with the refrigerated train, the lobster had the opportunity to be transported from the sea to the mainland, and the price gradually increased and became a rare food. Friends chat, sometimes talking about their own here or there is not perfect. If you talk about "it is not good to eat too much sugar when you are young," you can say "

Well, Bitcoin is a protocol.  It is as equally functional when the value in USD is $10.00 as it is $10,000.00.
The network still has 30,000 TH/s. It is being  successfully used as a currency.  There is heavy use  in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Iran. 
The Bitcoin protocol is still functioning and will continue to function every 10 minutes transactions will be processed without a central authority of trust.
The transactions will be recorded on millions of different nodes around the world.  
My argument is that Bitcoin functionality is binary, yes or no, it does not care what the value of a token is, only that it facilitates commerce.

You can chose to have the opinion that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme but you are ignoring the facts of the situation. You are also ignoring the 30,000,000/TH supporting the Bitcoin network.
As far as Bitcoin as digital money, I think it has some clear advantages over other digital monies.  It is decentralized, immutable, tamper resistant, and programmable.
