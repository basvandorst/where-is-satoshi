Good point. If the aim is to help the poor, well, the War on Poverty has been an unmitigated disaster. But if its true aim was to solidify a class of people that were dependent on the government and therefore consistently seek to expand its scope and power to ensure the tap they have been trained to rely on never slows down or gets turned off... if *that* was the aim, then it has been a raging success. But, no, it has not helped the poor in the least.

You most certainly sound like someone who has no idea what it is like to have a truly difficult job.

I'd be very interested in hearing what your definition of "proven"is. Especially given the fact that you are the one that mislabeled a bitcoin welfare project as a UBI project. I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact that reddit users express very little enthusiasm for welfare projects, but blow their load the second anyone brings up a UBI.

Claiming that Bitcoin has inherent industrial use because "it has the Blockchain" is akin to claiming that a certain plot of land has inherent value because it has air. "The blockchain" isn't anything that everyone else doesn't already have, or those that are interested can't make for themselves in a hour or so for free.
Satoshi's gift to the world wasn't BTC. It was blockchain technology. BTC was simply the first meaningful way it was implemented. The question that is in the process of being answered is if BTC would become "sticky" and universal enough to retain market supremacy prior to more complex versions of the supplanting it.
I don't believe BTCs will ever be worth zero, but not because they have inherent industrial use the way gold, silver, and copper do. You are right that blockchain technology has enormous industrial use, but you can use blockchain technology without owning a single Satoshi.

I am not the one claiming that others don't have difficult jobs. I know  they exist, and have worked them. Also, I'm not asking others to tell me what job they have because a) this is the internet and everyone lies and b) I'm not interested in having someone else reveal personal information about themselves that could be used to identify them in the future.
Really fucking tough jobs exist and they are usually worked by really fucking tough people.

This is just as true.

It only hurts if they bought at 20k and then subsequently sold. Investing with a less-than 50-day time horizon is not investing. It's get-rich-quick seeking.
Also, I don't think I entirely feel bad for them because buying ATHs is rarely a smart move. BTC had seen 53% gains over the course of eight days prior to hitting 20k. Did anyone think that was going to be sustained? (Yes, that is very easy to say in retrospect.) Buy the 53% dive, not the 53% climb.
I definitely don't feel bad for them if they then choose to sit out until it hits a new ATH again in a few months.

I don't think "fault" really comes into play, but they deserve about as much credit for their bold foresight as someone who suddenly figures out that they just happen to be a fan of the team that is up by 24 points going into the fourth quarter.

It's really too bad r/definereddit didn't catch on. I feel like there are a number of terms that could definitely use a redditfinition.
Shill: Someone who likes something.
Cuck: Any male that fails to strap a machine gun to his dick.
