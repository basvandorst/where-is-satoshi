@_date: 2018-01-03 23:35:45
ur a fking noob mate they arent going under 100k anytime soon
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:32:58
more than half of that is owned by corporations that aren't going to put it into bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:13:54
134k unconfirms not going down ya nub 
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:03:55
There's definitely fees and there is definitely waits and there is transaction history. Some reporters are just retarded.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:50:51
anyone can draw a line
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:24:03
The bitcoin mempool is only clear because less people are using it. The problem with bitcoin is when there is an influx of transactions it creates a backlog in a couple of hours which makes the fees skyrocket. BCH doesn't get this issue as the blocksize is adaptive and miners can choose to mine 8mb blocks
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:12:05
who cares not everyone watches the god damn superbowl 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:06:24
why doesn't Andreas have a goddamn segwit address
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:43:31
surely that atm took government ID before it let you buy? Looks like its got a fingerprint scanner. If your really looking for privacy use localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:38:09
if anyone can accelerate this one aswell - 426fbef3fde866536a3623c2fa65d76caae2c2d6c6e3ea6d9e34912e848c1826 
Would be awesome
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:22:39
just hodl bro not that hard
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:00:29
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:07:09
People can't handle us taking gains, Ill be sure to come back to BTC once they adopt offchain and fees are back to normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:12:37
pay more this is bitcoin not bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:40
pretty sure it's time to sell since about 2 days ago
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:51:04
the lengths people go to get referrals 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:47:46


No but I suggest reading up on guides on how to use localbitcoins before you go buying.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:44:22
i'd be calling it bitcoin cash if i was a shill dummy
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:20:45
LN is a myth 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:24:02

Dude stop begging for money
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:51:41
world explodes nigga use the search on the side ffs
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:30:08
pick a time to sell so you don't get totally burned when lighting never solves a thing
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:50:01
wait a couple of days the mempool has to get through the expensive 500-800sat\byte tx's yours is low priority at 350
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:16:09
you help keep roger virgin at bay
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:40:27
those atm's charge like 10-30% on transactions try and buy it online like coinbase.com and dont move it from coinbase until you have a substantial amount because its gonna cost you like $10-$15 everytime you move the funds outta coinbase. (Coinbase arent gonna steal your $100 worth of bitcoins so its safe to leave small amounts in there)
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:33:48
possible segwit support cuzzy bro
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:10:35
his probs ugly bro
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:05:30
there is no point having btc until then im just losing money... if btc ever adopts to using offchain i'll be sure to come back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:36
them 280k unconfirms doe
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:55:24
nah its in one transaction so it will all confirm at same time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:02:11
yeah i cashed in aswell im so over these fees
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:21:12
send them your ID's 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:45:11
Rad well.. you just paid 30% for privacy if that floats your boat then continue to buy from that atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:36:12
nah where did you buy it from for starters?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:33:02
that just means you lost $30 in fees welcome to bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:37
Im personally sick of bitcoin and i'm slowly selling all my bitcoins. I'm over the fees and the amount of time it takes for confirmations. I dont care about this lighting network I dont even think its going to materialize. I can see bitcoin is like Myspace and Facebook is coming in hot to take its place.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:11:19
I gave good info below dont be a hater
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:44:44
most be people who hold substantial BTC wont have it in an "Online Wallet" you can simply transfer BBC out of. If you looking for tips maybe put together a step by step guide. Nobodys going to give you money for a half assed post. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:08:27
bch will be used in darknets soon that's how bitcoin got most of its value at the beginning they are all switching because of less fees which makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:00:04
mate stop worrying about the politics buy any coin you choose the whole point is being able to use it whether your buying drugs or a christmas present online bottom line people don't want to pay an extra $20 to use their money may as well go back to using fiat
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:50:08
so bitcoin has to get to $750,000USD before their amount you gave is worth $1000 lol 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:20:25
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:12:36
I put 50k in at 5k a coin and was sweaty aswell
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:58:41
yeah youd have to cash out to fiat quickly
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:25:17
no shit mate what do you expect the mempool is full give them something else on the card like litecoin or bcash or whatever else they arent gonna lose a shit ton in fees
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:46:34
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:52:33

@_date: 2018-05-01 01:11:21
bitcoin cash works better than LN atm 
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:01:07

@_date: 2018-05-01 04:43:18

@_date: 2018-02-04 22:54:42
you just ordered at the right mempool time what if you want a pizza when theres 200k unconfirms your not getting that pizza till 2 weeks later. IMO this is not ok
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:35:50
btc is dying anyways they need lighting to stay alive
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:57:02
oh god what is this world coming to
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:22:14
people will just sell their shitty s9's once its gets too low to profit or put them in the bin
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:33:45
its a bloody wordpress site just add bitcoin to checkout process instead of bitpay. Looks like Steve has a tech background he has just taken the lazy option
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:33:38

This lighting network is stupid everyone who sells anything needs a node
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:24:53
That looks like bitcoin cash to me
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:26:33
who did you pay it to? yourself? A merchant or another person with a lighting node? This shit aint ready for mainstream 
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:20:34
bra its alot easier to have a wallet than a lighting node go teach ur nan how to setup a node.
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:08:33
yes because 99% of places i go dont accept crypto 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:27:03
