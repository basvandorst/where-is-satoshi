and yet, none of them...

This is epic.  Thanks very much!
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:51:40
ohh fuck yeah

This guys views on 'valuing' Ethereum are weird.  Makes me think he doesn't get some key concepts about the decentralized nature of cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:59:12
Sumed it up quite well there!

I agree, independent reserve is great and fees are reasonable.  If you want to do lots of trading move your crypto to another exchange. BTCMarkets is also quite good, more liquidity than IR but larger fees.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:58:30
I believe what we're seeing is a lot of people being greedy fucks.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:52:19
Fucking irrational market lately.

Umm err, umm umm err

But they have employees, and job openings
How do they plan to monetise building a protocol.  I don't really understand where their funding is coming from..
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:34:12
Yep, testing on mainnet is just going to lead to bad sentiment in the short term.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:56:45
Don't worry, just hodl on..  I share your discomfort at the complete lack of rationality in the market..

But seriously, Warren Buffett doesn't no shit about crypto.  He said it himself..
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:58:06
and then down again.

What's your secret..

The merchant will probably have a channel with someone else, not you.  So yes but that won't close your channel.  And also no, they still 'own' the Bitcoin once you've sent it to them and they can spend it on the lightning network again.  The only reason they would need to close a channel is if they needed to send bit coin via an on-chain transaction for some reason (example - taking a % of profits and converting to fiat).  Most transactions would probably stay on the lightning network though once it's all up and running.

If you felt uncomfortable carrying a hardware wallet into such a country, maybe the best bet would be to store your encrypted private key on the internet somewhere instead. 
You carry nothing through customs. Then access that from within said country.
It's a very weird, and kinda useless law.  Kinda like trying to censor the internet..  good luck with that..
@_date: 2019-10-14 05:40:05
And the first version of the internet sucked.  Look at email.  We still use the same old protocols to send email now just with a bunch of extra stuff tacked on for security, user identification etc.
@_date: 2018-06-19 00:01:21
The points he brings up are super flimsy.  Like $57 transaction fee at the absolute peak.  No mention of the intense debate that has been going on for a while now about scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:46:00
holy ship indeed!

Can Steemit be regulated by mods?
edit: This is a super interesting question.  Essentially what people seem to be saying is 
"What is a censorshit-resistant manipulation-resistant form where (real) people can share their opinions (on bitcoin)?"  Which doesn't seem that difficult to achieve (though I think it's harder than it sounds).  Is the hard part also eliminating spam?  I guess any non regulated board is highly susceptable to spam?  And the magic question: 'how do you determine if a person (who tries to create an account) is real or or a bot/spam account/alt account etc.)?'
Interesting discussion..
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:44:17
Is there any way to see who made the up/down votes?
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:36:20
How so?  Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:37:35
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:03:24
Nobody knows...
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:51:07
Agreed, though I doubt this is a full reversal.  Look at the price on Chinese exchanges [here](  Huobi is trading at $2600 while Bitfinex for comparison is trading at $3300.

Hopefully it don't get below 1800..

I think you should watch this:
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:30:52
23rd largest exchange by volume.

But why for just 24 hours?  They'll still have an unhealthy fractional reserve % the next day when they pay it back.
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:57:16
Oh boy, if only they could have seen the future..
