I would argue that people don't avoid being full nodes because of the blocksize. They avoid it because it is a hassle to run an up-to-date node. If there where turn-key solutions to run my own node and point my favorite light-weight client to use it and I had a reason to not trust my current service provider (blockchain.info), I would not hesitate to set up my own node. 
Blocksize is not what is stopping me.

Thanks for your thoughts.
Upon review I agree that Prisoners Dilemma is perhaps not the greatest parallel. My point there was that the rational optimization for a miner is to acts selfishly and put as many transactions with non-trivial fees into the block as possible. Acting against the groups good while optimizing his own profits.
In the Tragedy of the commons analogy the scarce resource is the bandwidth, processing power and storage which the Bitcoin network use to handle blocks. When a miner decides wether or not to include a transaction in a block he only looks at his own costs of distributing, verifying and storing that data and how much fee he will earn from including it. If the fee is higher than his expense, as a rational player he will include it. But _after_ that the whole Bitcoin network _also_ have to distribute, verify and store it many times over. This is the scarce resource that is being depleted - nodes' willingness to accept bigger blocks when they don't get compensated for securing the network. A resource that _will_ be depleted when nodes leave the Bitcoin network because blocks has become too big to handle without getting compensated.
Hope it makes sense.

If we consider all aspects then it is a very broad question which can not be summed up in 'a graph' as you request. What I was trying to say is that you have to be more precise about which aspect you want a graph for and gave you some suggestions. Maybe then we can discuss what metric we can measure the aspect by and find a graph for that.

Let's, for the sake of discussion, say that your premise is correct and he ordered the killing of all seven people.
What does that have to do with running a marketplace? Because that is the only thing he has been found guilty of.
If the case is 'open-and-shut' as you say, why not just charge and convict him for the murders? Surely that is more important and more harmful than the marketplace?
The problem is that this case will be used against others in the future. People who probably have not comitted any murders. And they will be unfairly punished because of this bait and switch by the prosecution.
This case literally damages our justice system - no matter how guilty Ross is of murder.

I'm sorry, but that is completely false. A [Criminal Enterprise]( has nothing to do with violence towards others. It only relates to doing something criminal in an organized way (at least five people under your command), and of a certain size ($10 million dollars in gross receipts during any twelve-month period).


Yes he is. And it has nothing to do with this ruling.


The original indictment contained charges of murder for hire, and it was played up in the media to sucessfully enrage people like you who can't tell the difference between two separate lawsuits - one about murder, one _not_ about murder. Later the charges of murder for hire where withdrawn from the lawsuit, hence the bait and switch. The MD indictment is still irrelevant to this.


The problem is people like you who cannot see that convicting people unjustly is bad no matter who they are. Ross could have been Adolf Hitler him self - that still does not make it right to send him to prison for life for running a peaceful marketplace, and it damages the justice system for future generations.

Every other piece of software transferring value over the internet (banking, stock exchange, remittance), Facebook (as opposed to Diaspora), Skype/MS Messenger (as opposed to Tox/Jabber) and download.com (as opposed to Bittorrent).
The defining difference is: "Is it a protocol where noone can prevent you from joining as any role as long as you follow the rules?" If the answer is yes, then it is P2P.
Just because many choose to outsource their role on the Bitcoin network does not mean that Bitcoin is not P2P. I could also choose to pay someone like put.io to download my torrents for me, but that does not make Bittorrent less P2P.
I agree that it is a problem that people introduce trust dependencies on others by letting them be full nodes on their behalf. But that has no effect on the P2P properties of the Bitcoin network.

I see what you are saying about optimizing for static files versus an expanding record, thats a good point. But I think it is a bit misleading to call Bittorrent more centralized?


DNS seeds and hardcoded IPs are very centralized, how is this better than Bittorrent? Bittorrent also trusts noone and independently verify data according to the hash in the .torrent file or Magnet link.
I can see how a data transfer protocol can be optimized for Bitcoins expanding record data, but how is it more decentralized than Bittorrent + DHT?

What exactly do you mean by "centralized/decentralized"?
My point is, there are many aspects which can be centralized/decentralized - for example mining, full nodes serving SPVs, ownership distribution of bitcoins, exchanges and so on. 
Even retailers accepting bitcoins could be problematic if they where too centralized, though it has not been an issue so far.

The problem with no blocksize limit, as the system works now, is that the miner creating the block is not the one who have to pay the majority of the cost of distributing, verifying and storing it. That will be paid by all the other nodes who receive no compensation for this work. Blocksize will spiral out of control and most current nodes will leave the network.
Some might think this is fine, but it is _not_ a well functioning market.

Yes, miners as a group have an interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem developing. But an individual miner who competes for block rewards have a bigger incentive to use his resources to generate more hashes which exclusively helps him, than to use it to increase the blocksize which helps everyone including his competitors. This is very similar to the [Prisoner's dilemma]( which in this case leads to [Tragedy of the commons](
And it does not even touch on non-mining full nodes, who absolutely have an incentive to keep the size as low as possible.

In a perfect market, if someone is paying the price then the value must be worth it. Maybe someone gets more value from Bitcoin transactions than "the average consumer" and buys them out of the market. Maybe not. But Bitcoin will provide as much value as possible when the service goes to the highest bidder - just as with any other commodity.
That said, I think there are potential problems with the market in which Bitcoin transactions are sold which makes it very far from perfect. The service of distributing blocks across the internet and saving them on HDDs forever are not priced in as a cost when miners chose which and how many transactions to accept or reject. This is more of a "common good" miners get to use, which is why we have block size limits. There is no price function on these common goods which allows their supply to increase with demand and that's what's creating this awkward situation with the block size limit which essentially boils down to "how much bandwidth and HDD space should we force participants in the Bitcoin network to give away for free to the greater good".

@_date: 2015-06-26 11:31:19


I completely agree. And I believe that the problem is the inflexible supply of block space. If blocksize was a function of transaction demand it would balance itself out. But now we are left with the less-than-ideal solution of guessing the demand for block space and hard-coding a roughly matching blocksize into the protocol, which can not take into account how much is actually needed at a given time and how willing full nodes are to accept the bigger blocks, and not just turn off their node and leave, leading to centralization and diminished value of the Bitcoin network.


It seems that we agree on the basic premise and forces at work, just not the analogy. I know that it is not a perfect fit and you have to think about resources in a bit more abstract way for the analogy to match. Can we at least agree that blocksize cost bandwidth/processing power/storage for full nodes who does not receive compensation proportionally to the value they create by preventing centralization of Bitcoin? And that this can be seen as an unpriced externality which should be priced for the transaction fee market to work well?
@_date: 2014-10-17 09:57:56
I see what you are saying, but effectively you are just selling your bitcoins and loaning them out. You could easily do the loaning without bitcoins and get that risk/reward regardless of bitcoin. And you can also just sell your bitcoins and buy them back when you need them, thus avoiding the volatility, without loaning them out.
But ok, you found a way to do both at the same time. If you are happy with that there is no reason not to do it.

That's more or less what I'm trying to say. I just don't think the number of nodes will fall at all because of 20 MB blocks.

In Bitcoin, the current standard minimum transaction fee is approximately $0.045 (0.0001 btc). 
If we compare that with credit cards, they typically cost 3-4% plus a static fee. This shows that users are willing to pay around 3-4% because users make sure to transfer high enough amounts that the static fee becomes negligible.
Let's say Bitcoin users are willing to pay up to 4% in transactions fees. That means that the lowest amount users are willing to transfer via bitcoins today is $0.045 / 0.04 = $1.125. Or just over a dollar. While it is better than credit cards, it's hardly true micro transactions in my book.
On top of this, when the receiver of all these small transactions want to spend the bitcoins, he has to pay around the same transaction fees as all who sent him the small bitcoin amounts. This effectively doubles the transaction fee (because he has to reference all his incoming transfers to spend them and transaction fee is proportional to size of transaction), and also the amount users are willing to pay. So to be competitive with credit cards in micro transactions, **Bitcoin users have to transfer at least $2.25 per transaction to stay within 4% transfer fee**.

Yeah, I was also surprised when I learned it. But that is in fact how Bitcoin work.
When you send a Bitcoin transaction, you have to list references to all the transactions resulting in you being able to spend those bitcoins. Broadly speaking, every reference cost you a transaction fee because the more references you write in your transaction, the more kilobytes your transaction will be, and the transaction fee is based on the number of kilobytes in your transaction. 
If someone send you 1 bitcoin in one transaction, you only have to reference one transaction when you send it on, and therefor only 1x fee. But if you people have sent you 100x 0.01 bitcoin in 100 transactions, you have to reference 100 transactions to spend that 1 bitcoin. The size of the transaction becomes bigger, and therefor the transaction fee.
I simplified it a bit, but that is pretty much how it works.
You can sort of think about it like, if someone give you a $100 note, it is easier to move around and use it to pay with, than if 100 people gave you 1 1-dollar-coin each.

You probably want an Android wallet app that lets you store the private key, like mycelium or knc wallet (most of these are based on the open souce Android Wallet from Andreas Schildbach).
There is a bit of a trade off between user-friendliness and security (relying on third parties is just one security concern). When you don't rely on third parties, you have to do the security your self. It's not a big problem if you only have pocket change in your Bitcoin wallet, but if you have a substantial part of your savings you will have to do some work to secure it properly.

The only measures are the ones put in place by the user or agents working directly for the user. This is very much on purpose. 
Anyone can pay for services or goods and then claim the money was misplaced or misappropriated. In traditional digital payment networks, the receiver has no idea if they have actually received the payment before up to 180 days after the fact, in which time period the money can magically disappear from their account.
Even worse, in traditional payment networks the bank or Paypal or whoever owns the network can be compelled to plain steal your money on behalf of any number of government agencies. Or frozen indefinitely by the payment network on suspicion alone. All because someone once said "Why aren't there fail safes in place?!?!!" and the temptation was too great for the banks and the government.
Bitcoin was founded on the principle that to avoid this, whoever knows the password owns and 100% control the money. No more, no less. *Noone* can take your money as long as you protect your password. If you need help protecting your password, that is a *voluntary* choice - *not* baked into the system and impossible to opt-out of like all the other payment networks.

The reason that the price stays the same is because the producers know in advance that "national bread day" is coming - so they prepare and ramp up production.


It's all about supply and demand, and how much an event pushes it out of balance. The bigger something is ( = more commonly traded in large quantities) the harder it is to push out of balance.
It is also about how anticipated the event is, like with "national bread day", because then the event can be build into the price already - and then the price would actually change if it turned out that people unexpectedly did not buy more bread on "national bread day" after all.

There are plenty of people holding on to bitcoins, a healthy amount of selling is good for the liquidity on the exchanges and helps finding the market price quicker.
There are basically two practical parts to Bitcoin. The transaction system/protocol Bitcoin (usually written with capital B) and the units of account exclusive to this transaction system called bitcoins (with lower-case b).
While these businesses don't make much use of the bitcoins, they gain lots of permanent and tangible value from the Bitcoin transaction system. This is where they get lower fees, fast transactions, true access to a world-wide customer base (not just the western world) and remove the risk of charge-backs. They are all very real advantages that does not require them to hold bitcoins themselves.

Depends on the type of economic crisis. If the US dollar starts hyper-inflating and taking other big currencies with it, bitcoins could start looking very appealing when people look for ways to secure the value of their savings, while still being able to use it over the internet. Precious metals are not as practical in this case, though better than fiat.

True or not, that's completely irrelevant to a payment service. A payment service delivers money from one entity to another. No more, no less.
If people want more "protection" from bad actors, they should absolutely use that. But in PayPals case that is a combination of Escrow and Censorship. Sometimes that is what you want, but it is per definition not payment.

@_date: 2014-08-27 13:15:09
You own bitcoins the same way you own everything else. You have full and exclusive control over it.
The Bitcoin network is essentially a giant distributed database over who owns how many bitcoins. All accounts in the database requires a key to spend them (which is the only thing you can do with them = full control).
So if you have the key to the bitcoins, you have full and exclusive control over them, which means that you own them.
If two or more people have the key, they will all own the bitcoins. But we all know how messy it is when more than one person own the same thing at the same time, so we try to avoid that.
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:39:43
It depends on what you want to do.
If you just want be able to spend your (in this case hopefully small amount of) bitcoins and the back up is just in case you loose/delete your wallet on your computer, you should not delete it. Just use it as normal.
If you made the backup to secure your bitcoin savings from theft and don't plan to use them for a long time, you should delete any trace of your wallet on the computer.
Both are valid solutions, and you can make two wallets, one with your savings where you back up and delete the wallet on your PC, and another spending wallet where you have your day-to-day spending bitcoins and don't delete the wallet on your PC after backup. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:51:51
Depends on which part of Bitcoin you want to work on.
If you want to develop the next cryptographic algorithm, or in other ways interact with Bitcoin on a low level, you probably want to be aware of and control its memory usage. If you are more into the business application side of the game, go with the high level languages - I love Groovy myself, and I hear good things about Google Go for financial systems. (hmm... that's a lotta g's...)

* No, I have a significant amount of bitcoins, but it would not change my life significantly if it disappeared. This is mostly because I choose to live under instead of over my means.
* Yes. This lowers risk because you only have to handle all your funds at the same time when you create the cold wallets - if at all.
* What ever is the best balance between convenience and safety at the time. What particular service is best will change because cold storage is long term.
@_date: 2014-08-14 11:21:15
You put money in Bitcoin by buying and holding. That's demand. When you then sell, demand goes down to by as much as you raised it by buying. But in that time you where holding it, demand was higher than it would otherwise have been. If enough people do this in overlapping intervals, it creates a constant average demand. This is like a never ending bobble, but that's how all currency works and have been shown to work in the long run.
Or you can put money in Bitcoin by creating or investing in services that makes Bitcoin more useful.

Instead of challenging the status quo they should make it irrelevant.
"DarkMarket" defines it as "Here you can trade all the things the government don't want you to trade".
"FreeMarket" would define it as "Here you can trade anything you want, regardless of what anyone thinks incl. governments".

Unless you separate your savings and your pocket money, it is going to be extremely easy to steal if a thief just needs the phone and hardware device to spend all your bitcoins.

Because theft, fraud and money laundering never happens in regulated industries, right?


Do you even know what regulation is? Laws punishing theft and fraud holds everyone accountable. No regulation needed. Regulation tries to prevent theft and fraud by applying restrictions on lawful behavior. These restrictions are applied arbitrarily and mostly fails miserably, not preventing any theft or fraud but just sucking energy out of the industry and increasing the barrier to entry.

Let's take a look back to the 1995 Internet shall we?
1. There is no reason to use the Internet to communicate. You have to dial up with your phone anyway, so it costs the same.
2. Privacy - The Internet offers little privacy out of the box. You need to go through hoops to achieve privacy. People who care enough to go through these hoops have better alternatives (like encrypted letters in the mail!), which are more foolproof.
3. Being your own Post Office - Few people want to take the risks associated with being a Post Office. It is more of a headache than a plus.
4. No consumer protection - No need to elaborate.
5. Distrust of the federal postal service - The unreliability of eMail makes it useless as a medium for communication, and there are better and more reliable options to send your information. Few people buy into the tinfoil-hattery that the government would ever read through anyones letters, or that the postal service ever misplace your mail.
Yeah, that Internet thing is useless. Realists like me see it for what it really is.

This is wrong on several levels:


Messages, pictures and video are not digital property. It's just data. And copying data (spreading information) without going through a middleman (like a newspaper or TV station) is exactly what the revolution of the internet gave us. That many people now choose to use middlemen for the sake of convenience is true, but it is not required, and it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
What Bitcoin (or rather blockchain technology) *does* do, is transfer information that should *not* be copied. Like money, title, domain names, etc.
I appreciate his attempt to "dumb it down", but it is a rather misleading result. Why not just use the examples of peer to peer money, deeds and ownership transfer to illustrate the new possibilities of Bitcoin?

Nice tip! It looks much more professional than any others I have seen.
Unfortunately it seems that they don't use "n of m" signatures with timelock so they can't loose the coins, but instead hold the coins themselves.
From their FAQ:


Because we don’t keep any of your funds stored with us, we need your addresses specified before you’re able to sell any items so we can forward the coins as soon as an item is sold or as soon as it’s marked for escrow release in the case of an escrow.


All coins are paid into cryptothrift’s wallets, fees are automatically deducted and coins sent straight to the seller. In case of an escrow, coins are transferred straight to our offline wallets where they will be transferred to a cold wallet until the reception of the item is confirmed by the buyer.
But still the best crypto marketplace I have seen so far.

Good to hear! I have been looking forward to trying your service since hearing about you on Lets Talk Bitcoin! I have a few questions:
1. Which countries exactly?
2. How is your service free? At the buy page you say *"This is the price of 1 bitcoin including exchange and ZipZap processing fees. The actual price will be determined by our exchange partner at the time of your payment."* That would not lead me to think that buying bitcoins from you was a free service. Is it?
3. It seems that I can only buy between €10 and €300. Any plan to let customers buy more at the time?
4. I can't find any info on delivery time. How soon after you receive a customers payment does the customer have the bitcoins?
*Edit - ~~I'm kind of disappointed that none of my questions are answered, even after 24 hours. Reddit is not a place where you just dump press releases and don't answer questions.~~ Thanks for getting back to me :)

Absolutely. But a side effect of that "protection" is that people can NOT buy miners, and can NOT buy Bitcoins, and can not buy a lot of things that they want because PayPal deems it to be undesirable.
If the "protection" was an extra service that PayPal customers could choose (and more importantly NOT choose), I would have no problem with it.
PayPal is first and foremost a payment service. And if I can not pay for the things I want to buy, they have failed. This is what Bitcoin gets right. "Protection" can always be built on top of the payment service and offered to the customers who want it.

I think the potential is a lot easier to quantify than the risk. [This article by Rick Falkvinge]( proposes a potential bitcoin value within 6 years on the $100,000 or $1,000,000 order of magnitude. 
I like the analysis because it looks at which current financial services that Bitcoin would be likely to displace a part of, which I think is the right way to look at it.
On the risk side, I have looked at several possibilities which would rank high in both likelihood and impact, e.g. push Bitcoin back to the enthusiast fringes:
* A critical bug is discovered in the Bitcoin protocol and devs are not able to fix it in a timely fashion
* A new cryptocurrency is launched with enough better features that it overcomes Bitcoins network effect and Bitcoin is not able to adapt quickly enough
The above is mainly because Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is very new and unproven, and the risk will fall quickly as they mature in coming few years.
Things that could delay Bitcoin adoption significantly:
**Coordinated attack by government and/or incumbent forces** could delay Bitcoin adoption significantly, but because Bitcoin is international these forces will have a very hard time stomping out Bitcoin globally. Innovation will just move to another country.
**Bitcoin network scalability** could easily delay adoption if a series of network disruptions occur. But I have researched this enough that I feel confident that there are solutions that can be implemented in a timely fashion, given the need.
As I mentioned, I think the price is low. So no, I have not cashed out :)

The problem is trust and proof.
If the "phone number -&gt; Bitcoin address" information is hosted by a central entity, that entity has the power to steal or block any money sent to you.
In case of a distributed system for storing the "phone number -&gt; Bitcoin address" info, it is very hard to prove that a phone number belongs to you, and make sure that only you can write and update the "phone number -&gt; Bitcoin address" info. I'm pretty sure a reliable system for proving ownership of phone number has not been invented yet.
I know this tastes like a "this is not safe enough" answer. But hey, this is what do you expect? ;-)
If you can trust a company like WhatsApp with hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins per user, then sure, no problem. But it is quite different from trusting them with your casual text messages.

@_date: 2014-10-17 09:25:50
All right, I'll play :)
As far as I understand your proposal, you want to expand and contract the supply of your crypto coin based on the sales of your crypto for USD, and thereby keep the value of your crypto constant in USD terms. Right?
Firstly, every transaction (crypto &lt;=&gt; USD) is both a buy and a sell depending on which end of the transaction you are on. So you would have to decide on a target conversion rate and issue new crypto if the USD per crypto is over your target, and destroy crypto if the USD per crypto is lower than your target.
So far so good.
* How would you issue your crypto to adjust the rate? Just add crypto proportionally to all accounts? That sounds like a massive transaction! :D
* How would you destroy crypto to adjust the rate? Subtract proportionally from all accounts? Also very big transaction. How would you explain to people that their balance goes up and down depending on other peoples transactions?
And most importantly: How would you do price discovery? Maybe you could make a distributed exchange as part of the system and use that as a source. But how would you stop manipulation? I could just keep selling very high or very low to myself and there would be no way for the exchange to prove that it is not fake transactions. And if I wanted to sell high or low without telling anyone I could just find a buyer, send the crypto to him and let him pay me via cash or what ever other channel not controlled by the crypto network.

Charity only goes so far. There are good reasons why models like Kickstarter/Indiegogo are so much more successful than simple donations. People really feel that they get something in return.
Trust: Highlight other successful projects you have done and why you think you will be successful in doing what you are asking money for. Present a compelling human story about who you are. Present how funds will be used and a plan for completing your project.
Value: Tiered rewards are a tried and true method to maximizing donations. Research successful projects on Kickstarter/Indiegogo for reward ideas. How about selling people a cut of possible future profits?
Anyway, that's just my two milibits :)

Not true. It has a significant cost per transaction. It is just charged to the store, which in many countries are forbidden from charging their customers a direct payment-card fee.

Congrats Andreas. Your name adds a lot of credibility to their security IMO.
@_date: 2014-11-30 10:58:56
No. In this regard it is pretty much like bread or dollars - with the important exception that the supply of bitcoins is restricted by the bitcoin algorithm/protocol which enforces that no more than a total of 21 million bitcoins will ever be issued, a specific amount is issued every 10 minutes on average (every block), and the specific amount is halved every 4 years. Around 70% of all bitcoins there will ever be have already been issued.
This does not prevent periodic fluctuations, but in the long term the price should follow the general economic development of the world. This has historically been around 3% per year since the industrial revolution. And that is much better than fiat, which for larger currencies are typically around -2% or -3%. So, holding bitcoins will tend to make value, and holding fiat will almost certainly loose value.

In the Bitcoin world (or terminology), knowing the private key is the definition of owning the bitcoins associated with the address.
Owning bitcoins in this context means having complete control over them, being able to spend them any way and at any time you wish, within the general rules of the Bitcoin protocol. This is much like owning something physical, which in its basic form means having complete control over it within the rules governing our physical world.
Stealing does not exist in the Bitcoin world, but outside of it, where people can get private keys in an unlawful manner, for example via hacking, coercion, spying, or theft of any physical token(s) the private key may be recorded on.

I believe the "Trade is not a crime" quote in the headline is a statement of opinion, not a statement of fact.
I really think the devil is in the details here. Most people can quickly agree that using children for pornography or humans for slavery is bad and that we should do our best to stop it. The question is if banning trade is the best weapon, or even a desirable one at all.
If we don't hold producers of knives responsible for violent stabbing crimes, why should we hold operators of market places like The Silk Road responsible for the actions of their users?
Even if we accept the premise that holding market places responsible for their users actions has some sort of impact on bad behavior, what are the unintended consequences? Market places will have a huge risk profile and they will have to pass on the costs to their users in the form of high fees, inefficient handling of goods and violation of their users privacy. That's the world we live in today, and before you have seen markets like The Silk Road, you won't believe how great a service a market place can provide when they don't have this government threat hanging over their heads.
In all the examples you give, there is a separate crime from the trade it self. The trade it self have no adverse consequences.
- Murderous weapons have to be used for murder to be murderous
- Drugs have to be produced, distributed and used to have consequences
- Someone have to produce the child pornography for it to hurt a child - I don't think anyone hurt in this way think that the sale afterwards was the worst part.
- Identities, passwords, medical records and private information has to be copied without permission to be abused (in these cases you don't steal information, per definition - but that's another discussion)
- Human organs have to be stolen or coerced from the original owner for there to be a real crime

Well, in most countries you have to declare it (and maybe answer some tough questions) when importing any amount above ~10.000$ in value. Bitcoins included.
While it is not very well defined excatly when you have imported bitcoins ("where physically are your bitcoins?" is hard to answer), I think most governments will start asking questions when you start using your foreign bitcoins in the country.
For small amounts it's probably easy to fly under the radar, but if you start buying expensive houses and cars, I think there is a fair chance that someone will investigate how to you came by the money to buy them.

Each transaction on the blockchain costs 1 transaction fee. With a micropayment channel you can set up a session between you and someone else. During the session, you can send as many payments back and forth between you as you want, and when one of you decides to stop you both get your share of the money in the channel and the channel stops. A channel costs 2 transaction fees.
The channel can be open as long as you want, but you can only use the money that was put into the channel to begin with, and the money you put into a channel can not be used in other channels or normal bitcoin transactions while the channel is open.

Bolivars only lose value in the future. So if you need to buy a bread today and have more bitcoin than you need for savings, it would make sense for you to sell a half breads worth of bitcoin for one breads worth of bolivars and effectively buy the bread for half the bitcoins you expected.

It does not have to be a net sell pressure at all. 
Lets assume that all businesses sell all their bitcoins right after a purchase (this is not the fact, but sure, close enough right now). 
Yes, some people are just using their bitcoin savings with the new offerings, but people like me buy at least as much as I spend in bitcoin because I don't want to deplete my savings. Especially now that the price is almost at a 6-month low I am more than willing to buy.
Add to this that people who didn't want to speculate in bitcoins before because no shops where accepting them, now have no reason not to buy and hold bitcoins. That creates buy pressure.
So does the fact that more shops accept bitcoins and immediately sell them create more buy pressure or more sell pressure? I don't know, but it is not as obvious as some people seem to think. There are a hundred other possible reasons for the decline in bitcoin price.

I was not aware that there where different opinions in this regard, but good to get it out of the way. For future reference see  which states: 
"In computer science, an implementation is a realization of a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component, or other computer system through computer programming and deployment. Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard."


- Smartasses that believe their new protocol is better than everyone else and they should take it without proper testing and ignoring side-effects.
- Smartasses that believe existing protocol is the best and they don't care to put the latest fancy code if everything works ok.
I'm not sure why you feel the need to call all pool operators "smartasses". I think that many pool operators take their responsibility very seriously. Of cause it is a new business, so some amateurish behavior is to be expected, but I don't think it is as black and white as you put it. For example, I think that pool operators did a fantastic job of swift cooperation in March 2013 at the bitcoind 0.8 fork caused by the change in database.


There is always a choice. Bitcoin developers can not force anyone to update, and will have to convince a large majority of node owners (mostly pool operators) that it is a good idea before they even think to implement IBLT in the reference client.
If you are in the minority, it will be increasingly expensive to insist on running your own version of the Bitcoin specification and not update. But there is always a choice.

There are other reasons to put money in Bitcoin than currency speculation.
For example, say you are an immigrant worker and you want to send money to your family somewhere in Africa. You can either pay Western Union or exchange your dollars for bitcoin, send them to your family, and have them exchange them to their local currency (or use the bitcoins directly if local businesses accept them).
Using Western Union will easily cost you 20%. The two bitcoin-fiat transactions and a negligible transfer fee might cost you 10% (very conservative estimate). In this case you can have your bitcoins go 5% down in value and still save 5% for your self. Everybody wins (except Western Union), and the value comes from Bitcoin being the cheapest and most widely accessible system for transfer of value.

I really like how this is a low-cost alternative to Trezor. 
It doesn't support visual off-device confirmation because it does not have a display and buttons to accept/reject signing the transaction. But it would require a lot more sophisticated attack than just a virus looking for private keys. And it costs a lot less.
This is still great for protecting against potential loss of bitcoin by
- All but the most sophisticated virus/malware
- Theft of device
- Somebody using your device without your supervision
There are still aspects that could be improved (like fx. letting the user generate the private key), but over all a very promising product that could fill a niche for low cost hardware two-factor auth.
Good work Peter!

First of all. If you accept common payment methods as a store, you have no control over how your customers pay - debit or credit, foreign or domestic. This is because you are not allowed to charge fees specifically for the payment method. And that is also why customers who pay with domestic debit cards also pay for the cost of foreign credit cards, through a general increase in prices.
Secondly. Here in Denmark, which is very much a part of the EU, you pay between 1.5% (domestic debit card) and 3.75% (foreign credit card) in transaction fees ([Source in danish]( And that is *not* including charge-back fees, fraud resolution costs and fraud prevention costs.
In all, transaction fees are *conservatively* between 2-3% on average.

Trade is the tool that align the incentives - not the incentive it self. There still need to be a buyer to drive demand and provide incentive to supply, otherwise trade would not happen no matter how free trade was.
But sure, if "trade was hindered in some way" it would be impossible to sell and therefor only producers who consumed their own product would be left. The profit incentive would go away. However, as the "War on Drugs (that are not socially acceptable)" clearly shows, **criminalizing trade** does not hinder trade in any significant way! And it creates a host of very real problems, like wasting immense taxpayer funds and putting crafty traders in prison where they just burden society (and ruin their lives) instead of using their skills to better society.
If we could magically stop trade of specific things without huge negative side effects, it might be worth discussing. But we can't. Not with criminal law at least.

Not just currency, but all things traded. The price for bread for example is very stable. Not because a lot of people are saving up bread, but because a lot of bread is sold and bought every day.
If all of a sudden big producers of bread stopped making and selling bread, the price would go up. And if a lot of people started eating spaghetti instead and stopped buying bread, then the price would go down. How much the price changes (volatility) depends on how noticeable it is compared to the normal volume of trade. Low volume leads to large change in price, and high volume leads to small change in price.
Basic supply and demand. And that's how dollar and bitcoin prices also work.

It does not solve that problem. It only solves the use case where you want to send a lot of transactions back and forth between two specific parties. In that case, you can send unlimited transactions as long as you keep the channel open, and only pay 2 transaction fees. The really good part is that it is trustless. So at *any* point during the micro payment process either party can leave, and take with them whatever belongs to them at that time.

I'm just pointing out that current utility is not indicative of future utility. Every major technology we use today was impractical in the beginning. I don't know if Bitcoin will be a major technology in the future, but "It's not practical now, so it will never be practical" is just not a valid argument.

No. He is asking whether anyone has discussed systems for implementing voluntary censorship in TOR nodes on the key level.
He is not saying he is for or against it.
Your headline is completely misleading.
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:42:38
It is still guesses with a lot of assumptions. And those assumptions are unreliable at best.
Besides, having someone see that the transaction came from TOR is a lot better for your anonymity than if the public can see the original broadcast IP - which I see as the alternative.

I would hope that Bitcoin is for people who are naturally skeptical of any system in which they store their wealth. Part of that is starting small, just as most sane people do.
No responsible person would say to themselves "Hey, that Bitcoin thing looks interesting, maybe I should play around with a few bitcoins worth a couple of thousand dollars"
And working with tiny fractions of the base unit is just an extra mental barrier which you absolutely don't need when Bitcoin is already hard to understand. Making more base units common, like "bits" is just a natural solution to this.

Thanks for your comprehensive post. It raises a lot of good question. I see that you have not gotten many replies - I think maybe you will get more feedback if you split your questions and concerns up in smaller posts with less wall-of-text. Just a friendly suggestion :)
I use Bitcoin for both investment and as a payment system.
As for the investment part, I don't have other investments except for savings in my checking account going towards buying an apartment soon. I bought around 100 bitcoins a couple of years ago when they where around 130$ each. A very risky investment that turned out to pay off.
The reason I invest in Bitcoin is beacuse I feel that I understand it and the risks associated much better than any other investment I could make, and that the current price is low compared to the potential to succeed and risk of failing. Don't get me wrong, I think that there is a rather large risk of Bitcoin failing. But the astronomical potential more than outweigh it at current prices.
If I just wanted to beat inflation and maybe make a bit on the side until my retirement, I would probably invest in bonds and stocks - but right now the money I have in bitcoin, although substantial, is not something that would risk my personal financial stability if it where to disappear tomorrow.
As for Bitcoin as a payment network, I find it exhilarating that I can send the equivalent of nuggets of gold anywhere over the internet, easier than sending an e-mail. The money in my bank or Paypal accounts are not really mine. They are just a promise of money I can ask for in the future. And sometimes that promise is broken. Sometimes the answer is 'no'. It is my view that banks and traditional payment networks like Paypal and credit card providers have gotten so used to their power that they don't have to treat their customers with any respect or give competitive value for fees paid. They seem to peddle around in their own little pond with very little innovation and government programs to suck dry one after another. Opting out of that system and actually owning my money feels great.
I usually find one or two things I can buy with bitcoin every month. This was nearly impossible last year. Merchant adoption seems to be expanding very fast. Last Christmas I bought all gifts with bitcoin from retailers who received bitcoin directly (no gift-card cheating ;-)), but it was really not very easy. This year I expect it to be much easier.

If you want to minimize your risk of loosing value on your  long term savings, bitcoin is not as appealing as for example precious metals.
Bitcoin is going to have high volatility for at least the next decade. However, volatility is not necessarily the same as instability. As deflationary international money, it will in theory continue to rise at above the average world economic growth. But it is also the most liquid money that the world has ever seen, and that means that the price can change extremely rapidly in the short term. This will hopefully be countered by high frequency margin traders, but how these forces will play out against each other is anybodys guess.

Yes, if this new mining protocol become widely accepted, all participants in the Bitcoin network will have to use it. But nobody says that they have to use the same **implementation**.

You can choose your own fee if you want. This is just a default fee for one wallet. If nothing else, it will make transactions at the old fee price point more likely to get into the first block.

OK, so if I understand it correctly, I would need to get bitcoins first and send them to you. So your 1% fee is for converting the bitcoins to PHP and sending them to local money service providers, like banks or brokers.
So if for example I used Coinbase (1% fee, ~0.5% spread) to buy my bitcoins, I would end up at around 2.5% cost to move my USD in a US bank account to PHP in a PH bank account.

Where bitcoin is better is in the separation of payment network and escrow service.
The problem with payment networks like PayPal, MasterCard, Visa etc. is that they try to make a one-escrow-fits-all. This is very bad because even the best escrow service doesn't fit all. And because there are only one escrow service in traditional consumer payment networks, there is no competition to improve that escrow system. So you are left with only one bad choice.

While I mostly agree with you, there are still important differences between Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology. All the variables that differentiates Bitcoin and Altcoins are inherent in Bitcoin, but has nothing to do with Blockchain technology.
If, for example, you don't like the block size or block reward algorithm of Bitcoin, it's perfectly sensible to say that you like Blockchain technology but not Bitcoin.
But still, I agree that it has become popular to say without specifying exactly how a Blockchain implementation should be different from Bitcoin. It's a bit like going back to 1910 and saying that you think cars are a good idea in principle, but Ford Model T is not good enough, without specifying how it should be fixed.
@_date: 2015-05-01 10:21:05
Found the answer: [Block timestamp](


A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours. "Network-adjusted time" is the median of the timestamps returned by all nodes connected to you.
Whenever a node connects to another node, it gets a UTC timestamp from it, and stores its offset from node-local UTC. The network-adjusted time is then the node-local UTC plus the median offset from all connected nodes. Network time is never adjusted more than 70 minutes from local system time, however.
So basically, every block has a timestamp found via network consensus. The miner who mines the block that recalculates the difficulty does decide what it should be, but it will not be accepted by the network if his calculation is off by more than 2 hours from the timestamp of the last block or 70 minutes from his peers local time.
For a calculation that happens every two weeks, that's not much room to cheat - especially when you consider that the miner can not anticipate that he will be the one mining the block with the new difficulty target.

Thanks for your reply and your thoughts!
I understand why you are wary of the Kickstarter model. It can easily come off as tacky. That's mostly why I wrote that you should think long and hard about what value you give back. But also, don't underestimate the power of a unique or limited token for people who care about a project. Creating a feeling of participation and personal stake is key, but also hard to do right because the right way to do it depends a lot on the individual project and what it can offer to backers.
But to ask you a question: If not kickstarter-style rewards or investment returns, what would you give supporters?

Okay, let me ELI5 it:
Yes, it is (in most cases) more expensive to convert fiat to BTC and BTC back to fiat than to just transfer fiat. However,


With this headline you seem to be implying that Bitcoin promised that you could transfer fiat cheaply. Bitcoin can make no such promise because it has no control over the interface with the traditional banking system. And in your example, it is the interface with the banking system that is the expensive part. The bitcoin transfer is so cheap that there isn't even a reason to count it in your example.
So concluding that the traditional banking system is great and that Bitcoin sucks on account of your example is wildly misleading. And that is what most people in this thread are arguing against.

Agreed. And it's even better than that. Because Bitcoin is completely open, it is relatively easy to conduct studies of real world double spend attacks and statistically quantify the risk associated with a transaction for each second you wait and see no double spend attack. From there you just wait until the risk is low enough for your need.


Banks do a lot of stuff besides transactions. Currently transaction middlemen take around 3-4% on average in developed economies. That could all be freed up for the benefit of both consumers and retailers. But I'm not so sure that Bitcoin could do much for the loan, mortgage, currency, stocks and derivatives markets. It is still highly regulated markets (with good reason I think), and the big banks excel in exploiting that environment. I think that the only solution there is to break up the big banks into smaller ones. Like Bernie Sanders says, "too big to fail is too big to exist".
@_date: 2015-05-29 12:49:14
I see your point, but I mostly disagree. Confirmation time is only slow because current software is lazy and says "transaction is confirmed when it shows up in a block". The truth is that you can very quickly (less than 2 seconds) say with a very high degree of certainty whether a transaction will go into a block, by looking at fees associated with the transaction as well as looking for double spend attempts via a well connected node.
In other words. The instant that a well connected node has propagated a valid transaction with adequate fees to its peers and no double spend is detected yet, the transaction will end up in the next block (or the block after that) with virtual certainty. At least with a much much higher degree of certainty than any other retail money transfers.
Right now the only practical way to get this feature is through a middleman service provider. But there is no inherent limitation which mandates this. It could just as well be implemented in software running on local hardware at a retail location.
The advantages for retailers in cost and risk are huge and scales well (as long as we don't run into transaction limits like the current one imposed by the 1Mb block size limit). 
The problem is consumer advantages, which are close to negligible in developed economies. And here is a bit of a chicken and egg problem where consumers don't use Bitcoin because there are no incentives, and retailers can't give incentives to consumers because retailers gets no benefit when consumers don't use Bitcoin.

These things will not go away, Bitcoin just makes it harder because the government have to actually force you to part with your money instead of just taking it. It would be the same if everyone saved up by hording gold (except gold is much less practical).

@_date: 2015-08-13 14:36:58
Eh... no. The Bitcoin network is set up so rules are defined by the group with the majority of economic activity.
The direct, technical majority that matters are the miners. But they are extremely incentivised to choose the fork that merchants will accept. Block rewards are worthless if they are on a fork that no merchants will accept. Merchants are extremely incentivised to choose the fork that consumers use, because otherwise they will loose sales. This chain of incentives also go the other direction from consumers, over merchants, to miners.
In the end it is a very general majority of Bitcoin users that choose which fork gain majority support. It is a simple question of general adoption.

This. Paying off debt is almost the perfect investment. No risk and guaranteed return. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:09:04
Yes, but it is even more complicated than that. The aggregate across all exchanges is only the available supply at current prices. 
If price goes up, more people will want to sell their bitcoins. And if the price goes down, fewer people will want to sell. And the same is true in the other direction. If people want to sell more or less for some other reason than the price, the price will change accordingly. It is a interdependent relationship that always tries to reach an equilibrium.
The difference is that Bitcoin has one less variable compared to fiat (and a big one too). There are no unexpected changes in the production of units, so people will not suddenly sell or buy more bitcoins because some government decided to print bitcoins (or stop doing so).

The usual victims of human trafficking _does not_ have anything pleasant waiting for them in the country they will be sent back to if caught by local governments.

Dear Theymos,
I respect the work you have done in this sub-reddit which I have enjoyed for years, but I interpret the rule you cite much differently than you do.
Whether or not Bitcoin XT is inferior is subjective and besides the point. We all know that any meaningful change to the consensus rules (a fork) technically creates a new currency which may or may not become the "new" Bitcoin depending on adoption, but that is not what most would call "some other cryptocurrency".
The way that changes to Bitcoin happens is by _proposing_ one or more changes to the consensus rules and try to convince others to adopt them. The way we are used to this happening is through BIPs which are discussed, but which can ultimately be vetoed by the "core devs" with write access to the Bitcoin Core code repository. In this way they can gauge the level of future adoption and efficiently implement changes which have wide support, and that has worked well so far.
_Another_ way to propose changes to Bitcoin is to bypass the "core devs", implement the consensus rule changes in a new client (like Bitcoin XT) and then try to convince the network to adopt the change. This is an important emergency release valve for situations where the "core devs" views no longer match that of the wider Bitcoin network.
Now, maybe Bitcoin XT is badly written, have reckless changes with no regard for responsible forking, have stupid concepts and have no merit whatsoever - I wouldn't know as I have not read the code. But it is still _a proposal to change Bitcoin_ and is on topic and should be discussed in If it really is no good, people here are more critically thinking on average than almost any other sub-reddit and I am sure it will get downvoted and torn to pieces. But this and other posts clearly shows that people want to discuss it.

What is more "standard" about versions of Bitcoin Core than of Bitcoin XT? It is just different interpretations of exactly what consensus code constitutes "Bitcoin".
Saying that Bitcoin Core is better just because the same people have been controlling the code for longer is centralized thinking - exactly what Bitcoin promises us to get rid of.
Current Bitcoin is the consensus code that nodes run currently. Future Bitcoin is what concensus code nodes run in the future, no matter where or who the consensus code comes from. If not, then we might as well go back to the centralized bank model.
All proposals to change consensus code - good, bad, genius or ridiculous - are on-topic if the headline is Bitcoin. No matter if it is advertised as "Bitcoin Core", "Bitcoin XT" or "Bobs New Consensus Code That Bobs Mother Think Is Totally Cool". Beyond that, let Reddit votes decide what should have visibility.

In most countries where prostitution is legal (including my own), pimps run prostitution with illegal immigrants. Their advantage is that they don't pay tax and can threaten their slaves (I think it fits the definition in most of these cases) with letting the authorities send them back to whatever war-torn hell they fled from. This let's the pimps sell their slaves for very low prices and achieve a high profit. 
Of course the legal prostitution has no such problems and people mostly forget it exists because there almost  everyone gets what they want, in a well functioning market. The horror described above is only possible because being an unregistered immigrant is illegal.

You seem to be confused about several concepts, which leads you to strange conclusions.
First of all, Bitcoin is not a piece of software, it is a technology as described in Satoshi Nakamoto's paper ["Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"](
The Bitcoin network (the biggest of many networks that uses the technology described by Satoshi Nakamoto) lets computers transfer Bitcoins and verify transactions by talking the Bitcoin protocol (language).
To make our computers transfer Bitcoins on the Bitcoin network we need some Bitcoin client software, again of which several versions exist made by different people.
Now, when you talk about bitcoin intellectual property, it could either refer to patents on the Bitcoin technology or copyright on the client software. 
Bitcoin technology was never patented and even the name of the inventor "Satoshi Nakamoto" seems to be a pseudonym, so no one even knows who he/she is and it is questionable if anyone could patent Bitcoin technoligy in the future. 
There are [many clients]( you can use to access the Bitcoin network, and all of which I have seen are published under free open source licenses like the MIT License or GPL. This means that you are free to copy, alter and build upon the software. If you really wanted to infringe on their IP, you could copy the source code and sell it as closed source software without giving credit. That is generally thought to be a very douche-baggery thing to do, but would not hurt anyone but the developers of the client software.
So in short, there is no intellectual property around Bitcoin that you could possibly user or misuse to hurt the Bitcoin network or it's users. You are free to copy any of the software, and there exist no copy protection (DRM) you could crack or break, as with your Microsoft Office example.
Finally you seem to talk about "cracking Bitcoin for your own use and/or profit". The only way to do that would be to find and use a flaw in the clients making up the Bitcoin network. First of all that would be very difficult because it is already constantly attempted by would-be criminals hoping to steal Bitcoins and no one has succeeded so far, and second it would have nothing to do with intellectual property, just software security...
TL;DR - There is not much IP around Bitcoin to speak of and "cracking" the Bitcoin network would have nothing to do with IP...
@_date: 2012-12-18 13:01:19
Very good explanation. 
A way to publicly receive money from people without having any of their addresses (or your own) publicly connected with that activity, is to set up a system where you generate a new address for every payment. 
So instead of having one public address displayed on your webpage, every time someone press "Donate" on your webpage they will be presented with a new address. You can then send bitcoins from these addresses to anywhere you want, and no one except you and the person donating can follow the paper trail.
@_date: 2012-12-21 11:58:00
Technically, I don't think the forks in the block chain can ever be merged. You would have to choose one or the other. 
But Bitcoin requires Internet connection and for all to agree every 10 minutes. If you are not connected to the rest of the network it naturally does not work. 
But in a real world scenario I think that you would pretty quickly figure out that your country was not on the Internet with the rest of the world, if that was the case. 
And if you don't make any new transactions before you are again on the full Internet, then you will not have any problems.

Bitcoins have intrinsic value. They are scarce and cost real electricity and hardware to produce. Bitcoins are essentially calculated numbers that are very hard (impossible with practical means) to guess. This attribute has intrinsic value, and (not so) coincidentally makes for a good form of currency on the internet.

ChangeTip is great for what it does. Creating awareness and lowering the barrier to entry for Bitcoin.
But it is NOT the Bitcoin network. It is no different than a bank. And letting them hold your bitcoins is just as risky as letting MTGOX hold your bitcoins two years ago.
There is a reason why banks are regulated and audited. Because when you give someone a lot of money to hold, it is only a matter of time before they run away with them unless they are being watched and threatened with the wrath of law enforcement.
TL;DR ChangeTip needs to be watched and audited by the government because they are a centralized bank. The fact that they only hold bitcoins makes no difference when they run away with the money.

Even better, if you have a keyboard with USB ports you can connect the bitcoin USB stick and hammer away on your keyboard.

Thanks for the link. Very interesting use case.
It is interesting that this method can be used in any use case where two parties want to move money back or forth between each other for a predefined period of time and settle the balance with only one transaction on the block chain before or at the end of the period.
And the beauty of it is that it is zero-trust where any of the parties can take his current balance and leave at any point in the period.
I guess the only downside is that you have to "post a deposit" for the maximum amount you want to be able to transfer during the above mentioned period.

It would be interesting to hear if anyone else have had similar issues.

I think a blanket ban of Bitcoin will be very hard to implement or enforce for most governments. Most governments are not single-minded entities working in unison - it's more like a confused hive mind with knee-jerk reactions and rare coherent thoughts.

I think that serious miners have a bigger edge over recreational users in terms of how high the difficulty has to be before electricity costs kill their profit. Serious miners will have a bigger part of their costs in hardware depreciation (for which they get better efficiency).

it depends on what odds you would like. If you bet more there is less chance of losing, but if you lose, you lose more.
You could bet the amount you need on a 50/50 bet, and not lose all your bitcoins even if you lose the bet.

I agree with this.
BitPay or WalletBit takes care of the messy details (including the "unstableness") still associated with handling bitcoins, but let you reap all the benefits.
As a small business with an international customer base, the non-reversibility of bitcoins is a huge advantage. This let you avoid fraudulent charge-backs which is all too common with international credit card payments.
@_date: 2013-06-18 09:14:45
Because the system is much much more efficient. Credit card transactions where never intended to be used on the internet. It is generally accepted that credit card service costs the retailer 2-3% of their revenue. On top of this the retailer will lose an uncertain amount to fraud and chargebacks. Fraud is such a big problem in non-westeren countries that most online retailers simply choose not to service non-western countries. And in western countries it is accepted as a basic cost of doing business because retailers doesn't know any alternatives.
Compare this to Bitcoin: A flat transaction fee of 5 cents. With an average credit/debitcard transaction size of over $80 ([source]( that's just  0.06% transaction fee on average - over 33 times cheaper than credit cards. Oh yeah, and no fraud.
Bitcoin is cheap because it does not need all the infrastructure to mitigate fraud and manage a complicated network with multi-region regulatory and security management. This is all built into Bitcoin or ignored (as in the case of regulation). Bitcoin knows only the internet and answers to no regulatory power except the Bitcoin community as a whole.

If you believe that we are currently on the way down between two highs and that the price will go up again some time in the near future, the sensible thing to do would be to decide on a time scale (depending on how long you think it takes to smooth out "noise" and how much in a hurry you are to buy). Look at the price difference from one mark to the next mark in your time scale, and if the price have gone up for more than two or three periods it would be a good guess that the downward trend have ended and it is a good time to buy for your intended period of investment.
But of cause, if you believe that the price will only go up, now is the best time to invest. And you you think it will only go down, it will never be a good time to invest.

The same is true for any currency not tied to physical things (most currencies in the world).
I could easily make an American Dollars 2 currency and print a lot of red Dollar2 bills with my face on it. But nobody would think that it was as easy to spend as regular Dollars because we are already using it, and it came first.
It's all about thrust that you can spend a currency in the future. That is literally all that makes a currency worth anything.
@_date: 2013-01-15 13:34:38
In practice this will give you a piece of paper worth the amount of money associated with it. Some might call this cash :)
The only difference from traditional cash I can see, is that you can add more value to it using only the public address (of cause in addition to the traditional features of bitcoin money). So you don't have to access you secret paper before you want to spend the money.
Beware that as soon as you load the private address back onto a computer to spend the bitcoins, they are again a target for hackers. This is why it is a good idea to have many addresses on paper so you can transfer a limited amount to each of them. Then when you want to use your bitcoins you can load only as many addresses as you are willing to risk.

I wouldn't say "it's that easy". You would have to wait until you actually find a block first. That could be months, even years. The reason why it is a bit expensive to write transactions to the block chain is because it is replicated to every client in the network. That's a lot of aggregate space and bandwidth when everyone and their mother want to write in it.

@_date: 2013-08-14 14:47:56
Well, it's a little technical. But in Bitcoin you don't need any internet to create and sign a transaction - it's all just a local cryptographic computation. You need internet to verify how much money the sending address has, to see if it is enough to cover the transaction, and to tell the world that you want to make the transaction so it will be included in the blockchain (the common history of the Bitcoin network if you will).
Normally it is yourself who broadcasts the transfer and the reciever just checks that it has been broadcast by asking the network. But there is nothing wrong with letting the receiver broadcast your signed transaction.
It is a bit like signing a check. "Offline" you can provide proof that you own an account and that you want to transfer an amount of money to a specific person. But the receiver needs to contact the bank to make sure that your account has the money, and give the check to the bank if the transfer is to take effect.
@_date: 2013-06-11 13:42:39
I think the most important social aspects of Bitcoin all center around giving the user the power previously held by the middlemen and issuer of currency.
The power to send money to anyone anywhere without asking a bank or other middleman permission (google Wikileaks + visa + mastercard).
The power to decide how much, if any, personal information you reveal during transactions.
The power of deciding, as a community, who should have the newly issued currency, how much should be issued and when it should be issued.

In theory there should not be any difference between exchanging bitcoins and exchanging any other **cash** currency.
It's basically the same regulation requirements, but ppl often forget that bitcoins are cash. The really innovative thing about bitcoin is that it works like cash on the internet, where as any other cash is bound to be physical.
As far as I can see there should be no extra regulatory burden for brick-and-mortar currency exchangers, but online exchangers who usually send currency to a bank account (not cash), which is a reversible transaction, now have to comply with regulation for non-reversible transactions (like cash).
For example, you cannot just go to a brick-and-mortar currency exchanger with a stolen credit card and empty the victims whole bank accout and get it in cash because you have to prove your identity and there are limits to how much you can withdraw.
On the internet it is far harder to prove your identity because almost anything can easily be copied. And that is why it takes time and is cumbersome on the exchanges that provide this service.
So, to solve this you either have to find a country without this type of required regulation, or find a reliable and fast way for people to prove their identity online.
On a side note, this is really a problem with credit cards and legacy bank transactions. With cash you are implicitly the owner if you are in possession of the cash - the only one who can say otherwise is a court of law.
Money in credit cards and bank accounts are only yours if you can prove that your identity matches the identity tied to the CC/bank account. In many respects it is not really yours.

Got any source on that? The way I understand it the transaction would be "transfer xx bitcoins from my-address to your-address". If I have to collect the bitcoins from many of my addresses there will be many inputs. But if I only spend from one address it doesn't matter how many transactions happend to fill it up. Nodes just have to read throught those transactions to verify that the new transaction is valid and not a double spend or over-spend. The previous transactions does not become part of the new transaction because it does not need to. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 17:02:16
Well, it is actually. But in a more indirect way because we pay the price of printing, handling and enforcing the ban on printing dollars indirectly via tax, inflation and higher retail prices.

Why can't the merchant sell the Latte for the bitcoin equivalent of $2.90 or even $2.80? They have to convert the price to bitcoin anyway.
Because bitcoin transactions are much cheaper than any dollar transaction the merchant has incentive to lower the price if you pay with bitcoin.
In addition, the bitcoin transaction fee is (or will be in the future according to Gavin Andresen) based on the transaction cost price. And because the cost is only dependent on the cost of computer power, storage space and internet bandwidth it will roughly follow Moore's Law which is in the ball park of a halving in cost every 18 months.
Storage has historically halved in cost faster and internet has halved slower, but they probably more or less cancel each other out.
This means that a basic transaction which costs 0.0005 BTC (5 cents) today, will cost 0.0000625 BTC (0.625 cents) in just 4½ years.

It would be very risky. It is not a stretch for the government to argue that bitcoin is a currency and any business exchanging bitcoins for other currencies need to be licensed and follow anti money laundering rules, and risk having all their bank accounts frozen for ages pending an investigation.

If you want to get technical I could argue that a free marketplace should allow all forms of pricing and if the price is a procentage of your total wealth or monthly/annual income then who are you to say that the price is wrong? Tax is the price of living in a country and you are free to choose another country if you think you can get a better deal elsewhere. But that's not really the way I see it.
The reason I think that it makes sense for a government to price its services in percentage of wealth or income is because it promotes equality. 
Unregulated capitalism has a tendency to make a very big difference between rich and poor. This is bad for social stability, which is bad for everyone. As it is the governments job to better society as a whole it makes sense to redistribute wealth to some degree.

I had exactly the same eerie feeling when I transferred my bitcoin savings to bitaddress.org paper wallets.
Start by printing out a bunch of paper wallets and play around with them with small small amounts of bitcoins. Transfer to paper and back to your online wallet several times and get comfortable with it. (Remember to write "Test!" or something on the paper wallets you play with! And never reuse a paper wallet that has been redeemed, unless it is strictly for testing!)
I also liked BIP38 encryption, so my paper wallets are password protected. It gave me the option of storing a copy of my paper wallets with a family member without worrying that he would take my bitcoins (our anyone else who could stumble over them).
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:39:18
Personal opinion:
For anything over ~$500 I don't trust any online wallets in the long term.
I found  with BIP38 encryption (just enforces a password on top of the paper wallet to redeem the bitcoins), with a medium-strength password I am sure I can remember, to be relatively easy to use for storing my bitcoins offline.
Because loosing the paper wallets are also a risk, I printed two copies and let a family member keep one of the copies. Even if my family member tried to take the bitcoins, he would have to break the password first. I think that risk is worth the safety of having an extra copy of my paper wallets in a separate location.

Well, I'm not sure it is really a thing, but in literature the LIX number is a measure of how complex the text is (eg. how hard it is to read). Basically long sentences with a lot of long words make a high LIX number.

They all are, in a sense. Miners have to pay electricity and hardware costs to mine them. That's real value invested in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
While mining increases the supply of bitcoins, it also adds to the value of bitcoins in that the system is harder to cheat and potential buyers are more likely to trust and use Bitcoin. If more value is being created than diluted by mining can be seen in the market price, which is currently going up (= more value created than diluted).

It is actually a net benefit. There will be the same btc on the market before and after the 10 btc transactions, but buying and selling creates liquidity and let people trust that they can easily sell or buy btc when they want to.

I used to agree with that point of view, but I have come to realize that the important differences between Bitcoins and fiat is not internet money vs. physical cash. Fiat cash is not as tangible as we might think. Inflation makes it loose value over time. The government will periodically issue new versions of coins and bills making the old ones worthless. And finally [currencies regularly dies or are reformed]( All this regardless of what happens to the physical cash.
To me, this means that every coin and bill is just a symbol or token of an amount of money. From Casascius bitcoins and "paper wallets" to fiat coins and bills, all they are is a representation of money that helps us use and understand them. In that regard Bitcoin should not be shy to borrow the parts of traditional money that actually works.

It is not from lack of trying. Several exchange services have tried to offer bitcoins for credit card payments. 
What happens is that they get bombarded with purchases with stolen credit card numbers. Because you can use bitcoins without leaving any trace to your name or address, it is practically an anonymous internet ATM. Further more, 10 minutes after using the stolen credit card, the bitcoins can be in any country in the world - or no country at all, depending on your philosophical view of the Internet.
This all stems from the fact that bitcoins are so easy to move - which is normally a good thing. Just not when you are interacting with systems with completely broken security like credit cards, where you rely on your local laws, police and court, as well as the fraud prevention centers of the credit card companies, to enforce good behavior.
The only reason why your credit card work in normal stores is that most things you buy are hard to run away with without being caught. And the few things which are relatively easy to run away with are routinely being exploited by criminals, accepted as a cost of doing business by the stores and credit card companies, and the cost of this is being sent on to you, the consumer, in the form of higher prices on goods.

We have no idea what 54 mBits are going to be worth in the future and we should not make rules or encourage defaults which depends on a variable value (like "how much is a Bitcoin worth") if we can avoid it.
And I think we can do a lot better than arbitrarily deciding which Bitcoin amount is too small to move. We already have that; it's one satoshi. You can't divide it, so that's the limit. Is the block chain being spammed with small transactions? Easy, just raise the fee until it matches the cost of processing. Why shouldn't that be an open market controlled by supply and demand?
We have no idea what innovative use of the block chain we will have in the future, but colored coins shows that it does not have to be the dollar value of a Bitcoin that determines the value of the transaction.
If you associate ownership of a car or a house with at specific satoshi you could easily imagine someone paying 0.0005 bitcoins in fees to transfer that satoshi.

They can. They just reflect the real price of loans in an expanding economy, instead of the artificial supply pumped out by governments, which in effect is a tax on money.
The housing market is also bound to supply and demand. If loans are more expensive, prices will fall far below the current price which is artificially pumped up by cheap loans.

Not a bad idea. It could work if executed right. Take some cues from similar ideas such as Kickstarter. For example, make sure that the BTC is returned to the donators in a specific time if the next installment is not funded in time.
Edit: [more ideas]
Also experiment with ways to get the hooks in the audience. Efficiently kickstarting a new series with a new author is critical. Experiment with first x number of installments free, or maybe issue the next installment in a new series after 30 days or 0.5 BTC donated, which ever comes first. 
It's a bit of a "chicken-and-egg" problem, popular series will generate lots of donations and better content and even more donations. The trick is to get the ball rolling on unknown series - they will need lots of help and free content before the ball is rolling.
Edit 2:
Maybe also let the author decide the "price" for the next installment, and let him/her lower the price if he/she thinks too much time has passed without enough donations.

The signature of the message is proof that the person controlling the address (e.g. knows the private key) wrote the message. As opposed to a fully encrypted message, the signature is only the encrypted hash (unique signature) of the message.
The people you send it to presumably already know your address, so you would just have to send the message and the signature.
For them to verify that you send the message, they decrypt the signature with your public key (= address), which will give the hash of the message, and then calculate the hash (unique signature) of the message. If these match, it is proof that you wrote the message, because only you can encrypt the message hash with your private key and the message hash can only be derived from the exact text in the message.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:44:00
That really depends on how you define "bitcoins". If you never accept a hard fork that makes more than 21million btc possible, then your bitcoin network will never have more than that. EVERY time there is a hard fork, a NEW bitcoin network is created. It is completely up to each and every user which one to follow. It is literally impossible to force any user to accept any changes he/she don't like.

I would store 250 BTC in paper wallets. Like you said, you don't plan to spend most of them before 2 years from now.
Split them up in 10 BTC (or similar) paper wallets with one copy of the paper wallets in a physical safe in your home and one copy in a physical safety deposit box in a bank or similar.
Leave the BTCs you plan to spend in the next couple of months in your online wallet.
This is really the only way to secure that amount of money. Even though there might be less than one in 100.000 chance that your online wallet is hacked, would you really want that risk for that amount of money? I would not.
The reason why this is so important is because the software we run on personal computers today (incl. Windows, Linux and Mac OS) are just not made for the kind of security required to handle non-trivial amounts of money. Computer security today is not about completely stopping hackers from accessing your system. It is about delaying them and identifying them before they get access to your most sensitive systems so you can plug the hole they happen to be using. Trying to close all the holes in modern software is completely impractical if not impossible.

Paraphrased: "In the industrial revolution when railways where booming, people had a hard time separating the value of railway stocks and the usefulness of railway technology.
There where huge, hype-fuled fluctuations in the stock price and many had a tendency to think railways where fantastic when the price where going up, and that railways where useless when the price was falling.
Of cause, today we know that the usefulness of railway technology had nothing to do with the price of the railway companies stocks.

It might be prudent to compare the risk of data loss on a device you carry with you versus an online storage service.
Good encryption with strong passwords will protect your wallet regardless of where you store it. The next priority should be not to loose the encrypted wallet, and that's where I would not trust a single device.

It is prefaced with:


Which clearly states that virtual currencies are NOT regulated under existing financial regulations.

Which goes further and states that this is backed up by an existing ruling that allowed a specific company to trade Bitcoin without complying with current financial regulation.
It is basically a completely free pass for Bitcoin business in Denmark until regulation specific to virtual currencies is introduced (if it will be introduced at all).
The article from business.dk you link to, completely misunderstands the announcement and interpret it completely opposite to what it actually says. It's not the first time the media misunderstands something about Bitcoin... (or news in general)

@_date: 2013-08-21 12:50:24
I think the argument you link to is very flawed.
Yes, an inflating currency creates *artificial* demand for what ever can be bought with the currency. Most people don't invest in sound business because their money becomes worthless in the future. They just take loans they don't need to buy worthless stuff.
Sure, this keeps the economy going in artificially high gear. But wouldn't it be better if people saved instead of loaned so they could afford to buy the things they need even during an economic crisis? The reason why  recent economic crises where so bad was because everybody and their mother had loaned money to buy things they didn't need and had literally less than nothing when the crisis hit them.
And as the saying goes; the higher you fly, the harder you fall. Artificially pumping up the economy when we want it to be stable sounds like a bad plan to me.

Basically anything you would normally use a credit card for is too low value for an attacker to bother with a double spend attack. (see 
With transactions bigger than what you would normally use a credit card for, people will have no problem waiting an hour or two to get ~6 confirmations (considered safe number of confirmations).


There is no blind faith in accepting a non-confirmed transaction. You (or your service provider) have an updated copy of the block chain and transactions that have not yet been put in a block. With this information you can prove that the customer has the required amount in his account and that the transfer message he is sending will indeed transfer the required amount to your account.
The only thing the customer can do (except for extremely expensive or improbable attacks) is to send a competing message to send the coins to another account owned by himself and make sure that this new message is accepted faster than the message he sent to you. But this in itself is very hard because he has to be better connected to the network than you and you can make it very hard for him by being well connected to the network and spread his transfer message as soon you receive it.
@_date: 2013-03-17 09:28:38
Yes. In this kind of graph long vertical lines are called "walls" - probably because they are tall and hard to get past. 
If the wall is on the sell line (blue), then it is called a "sell wall". It means that some or someone is selling a lot at that price point, and in turn that a lot of people have to buy at that price before the price goes up.
The same is true for the buy line (orange), except inversely so. A "buy wall" means that some or someone are willing to buy a lot at a specific price, and sellers would have to sell a lot to get the price below it.
Hope it makes sense :)

Fair enough. I guess we just have to agree to disagree then.


What I'm trying to say is that both fiat cash and Bitcoin coins/paper wallets are virtual. They only have value because of the system built around them. But that is not a reason to dismiss them. They make it much easier for people to understand the practical functionality of the currency: When you get it you own it. When you give it away or destroy it you don't have it any more. And you can't (easily) copy it.
This may seem like a banality, but it is the most basic functionality of a currency and physical tokens help people uninterested in technical details understand and trust it.

When you "cancel" a bitcoin transaction in a client, it just means that it lets you issue a competing transaction (which can have a higher fee). The first transaction to be included in the blockchain will be the "true" transaction. The other transaction will be discarded by all nodes as invalid because it is trying to spend bitcoins from an empty address.
You will have no control over which transaction the miners will include in the blockchain because they are both valid, but if the miner has any brain he will choose the one with highest fee. Incidentally this is also what is exploited in a double spend against people/companies who accept zero confirmation transactions.

Proposal for improvement of your set up:
Instead of storing the true-crypt volume on USB/CDs, store a live Linux distro on the USB/CDs. Set up the Linux distro with bitcoin software and your true-crypted wallet (or just true-crypt the whole she-bang).
With very little extra up front work you now have a as-good-as guaranteed key-logger free (software-based anyway) way of accessing your cold wallet, and most importantly completely independent of a dirty every-day OS.
@_date: 2013-07-22 13:30:56
I was also confused by this in the beginning.
When you buy at the current price it basically set up a buy order for you at the current cheapest price. If the current cheapest sell order is only for 1.9 BTC then you will only get that and you will then have a standing buy order for 1.1 BTC and have to wait until someone sets up a sell order for that amount again (e.g. the price goes down again). If the price does not go down you have to cancel your 1.1 BTC buy order and make a new one at a higher price.
If you want to make sure that you buy BTC for all your dollars, you have to look at the sell orders and make your buy price high enough that the top sell orders can fulfill the transaction.
Hope it makes sense... feel free to ask if it doesn't.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:53:00
I don't see why cashing out now would be bad for Bitcoin in the long term. I am currently hesitant to buy Bitcoins for general use because the recent skyrocketing of the price is clearly unsustainable, and the best case scenario is a period of stagnation. But investors are rarely rational enough to let that happen and I expect with &gt;80% confidence that we will soon have a downward adjustment. I think this is good, because noone gains from overvalued Bitcoins. Lets just hope that the adjustment will not kill too much adoption momentum.

Rick Falkvinge does a pretty good estimate of what order of magnitude the price of a bitcoin will be. If Bitcoin manages to capture just 1% to 10% of international and internet trade, one Bitcoin will be worth between $100,000 and $1,000,000.
Bitcoin really is in its infancy compared to its potential. But of cause there is also a good chance that it will fail or be surpassed by something better and be worth $0.

I think the only way is to sell your fiat on exchanges. You probably have to pay tax on your income, so you will need a lot of the fiat anyway.
A work around might be to tell your customers to send the fiat to the bank account of your preferred exchange (with a note identifying that the funds belong to your user on the exchange). Then you can bypass your own bank, and maybe even an international fiat money transfer if your client/customer is in another country. (This is just an idea, due diligence would be required!)
@_date: 2013-07-23 11:11:49
Offline transaction is not really Bitcoins strongest suit. 
Casacius coins actually shows the true cost of making physical cash, which in fiat is hidden and payed for with inflation (your dollar coins/notes slowly looses value no matter what you do - some of the value which the fiat issuer uses to manufacture cash).
If this is taken into account I actually don't think that Bitcoin does a worse job than fiat in regard to offline transaction, but it doesn't offer much, if any, improvements.
Online bitcoin transaction offers so many wonderful improvements over any fiat-based system that I think it is worth the effort to get a cheap smartphone with internet connection, even if it is only for that.
Would you mind explaining a bit further what transactions you would like to do where a smartphone with internet would be impossible or prohibitive?
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:52:08
Okay, more basic: Since the seller of the house knows that the bitcoins go up in value, he will be willing to accept a much lower price in bitcoins than if he was paid in fiat, which just go down in value.
Yes it will be more expensive to borrow bitcoins, but you will also be able to buy equally more with them.

Why would you assume that governments does not tax bitcoin right now? Yes, no government explicitly tax bitcoins, but most governments tax everything and then give a few explicit exceptions.

PRISM relies on central authorities because we trust them with our data and information. The connection between me and any service I trust is encrypted, so listening to the data going over the fiber gives them nothing. The encryption keys are generated with the Diffie–Hellman algorithm and the service is authenticated with their certificate, so a man-in-the-middle attack is close to impossible, even more so if attempted on a large scale like PRISM.
PRISM gives the US government back doors into big service providers like Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Google because we trust them with unencrypted data. The solution is to not trust the service provider with your unencrypted data, which is possible with for example Jabber and Diaspora.
The traditional Bitcoin client does not rely on trusting anyone with unencrypted data and services like Blockchain only store an encrypted version of your wallet (which is still worse than traditional Bitcoin client where noone sees even an encrypted version of your wallet, but still pretty safe compared to sending emails via Gmail or Office 365).

Theoretically yes that is possible. But Bitcoin is defined by it's protocol, and if you change the protocol you don't have Bitcoin anymore, but something else.
The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it very hard to push changes to the protocol to everyone (and thank god for that - we don't want selfish governments running around doing that). Every time you change the protocol it will create fractures and forks in the network ending up with one Bitcoin network that accepts the new changes and another network that rejects them. And you can't transfer coins between the two networks except through an exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:33:55
OK, thanks. I agree completely :)

This! If you use your every-day computer to access your bitcoins it will be vulnerable to hacking or trojan/virus no matter if you use 2-factor-auth or not. The attacker can simpley mimick your normal user interface, ask you for the 2-factor-auth and transfer what ever he wants, using your authentication.
An alternative to paper wallets (which IS the most secure if done right) could be to use a Live Linux USB installation and install a bitcoin client with your long term "savings account" on this. When ever you need access to your savings account you can boot up on the Linux USB and do your transfers. Because you only use your Linux USB for Bitcoin transfers and don't install any other programs on it or browse websites, the risk of getting exposed to hacking or trojan/virus is very very small.
This saves you the trouble with physically handling private wallet keys on paper and creating and printing new ones when needed, at a minimal cost in security.

Thanks for updating us who came late to the flame war :)
As far as I understand, you don't need anything like colored coins to blacklist certain bitcoins. When someone try to spend bitcoins (broadcast a transaction), they have to reference the bitcoins they want to send (technically the last transaction the bitcoins where part of, aka the Inputs). This means that the bitcoins can be traced through the transaction recorded in the blockchain, all the way back to the block they where mined from. So if any transaction they where part of where deemed "bad", then the coins could forever be identified as such just by looking at the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-01-15 14:10:49
Yes, non-reversibility is indeed a good attribute for a currency. This is also an attribute of all fiat cash. Only companies like banks and credit card companies have introduced automatic reversibility.
If a transaction is reversible, you have in effect not really made any transaction. This is a big problem if you are an honest company selling to cheating customers. They can send you money, receive your product and then take back the money, and in effect steal your product. It automatically gives all the power to the party sending the money.
If you have non-reversible transactions, and you don't trust the party you are paying money, you can find a 3. party you both trust who can hold the money until the product is delivered. This proves that you intend to pay and prevents the other party from running with your money without delivering the product.
This 3. party service is called [escrow]( and is a tried and true method used successfully for thousand of years. And with the internet it is cheaper than ever to run an escrow service.
If you wanted to buy from bASIC and didn't trust them, it is your own fault for not insisting on using an escrow service. If you trusted them, it is your own fault that you accepted the risk. 
Of cause bASIC's actions are highly illegal and customers should be refunded. But if you don't take any precautions, justice have a tendency to escape you - that's just reality.
TLDR; Non-reversibility is good because 'merica, that's why. (read my argument)

Of cause you would want to spend fiat if you had both bitcoins and fiat, simply because bitcoins are better and you value them more than the rest of the population on average. This is basic supply and demand. But many business models only works with bitcoins (or at least much more efficiently). In the cases where you can only pay with bitcoins or get a hefty discount, you will.
Additionally, when you only have bitcoins left you will start using them. For example if you have your savings in bitcoins, when you actually need to use those savings you will want to use bitcoins - savings are worthless if you never use them.
Happy bitcoin saving :)

Yes, I agree that this is the most practical way of doing it.
But if Bitcoin is to be truly decentralized, you can't just tell people to upgrade to a new protocol. Many will not hear about it, many will not agree, many will not bother, most may even not use the same client. And then you have two forks - essentially two different currencies.
This is problem for Bitcoin and all of us who want it to succeed.
@_date: 2013-06-03 10:57:21
I don't really see how a bank could protect itself from BTC volatility by running an exchange. The price is dictated by supply and demand, neither of which an exchange controls.
Not that running an exchange is a bad idea, it's just not related.
The bank should charge a fee corresponding to the cost of acquiring the bitcoins plus the cost in the risk of holding the sufficient amount for liquidity. All of these factors can be quantified and a profitable yet competitive fee established.

"expensive" is very relative. Compared to the huge sums of money people loose on credit card fraud, and what credit card companies spend on fraud protection, the cost of Bitcoins mining is nothing.
This is most visible in the cost of transactions which is a hundred times smaller with Bitcoin than with credit cards.

To an extend you are right. The problem with personal computing (very much windows, Linux and Mac also to an extend) is that it was not built to be secure in a ultra-connected networked environment full of "bad players" like the internet.
The core of all personal computer operating systems are inherently trusting of the code that gets executed on it and lets the code do pretty much what it wants. This was chosen because it was great for performance not to have to do security checks all the time and security was not a big concern 20-30 years ago. All security in modern OS's is build on top of this insecure core and therefore is full of holes which can be exploited.
Hopefully new OSs will address our increased need for secure systems.
TL;DR - The security problem is not with Bitcoin itself, but with the PCs we run it on which are just not secure on a fundamental level.

Indeed, make sure to check the speedometer (the small blinking light on your USB stick). If it blinks more than 2 times per second you are loosing coins!

I understand your frustration, I also went through a lot of bull the first time I purchased bitcoins. This problem you and everyone else have is real and not yet solved in a reasonable way.
But I think your anger with Bitcoin is misplaced. 
The problem with buying bitcoins for fiat is almost exclusively in the fiat part. When you use credit cards you don't really transfer any money. You just instruct your credit card company to promise someone the money. You can request a "charge-back", in which case the money is not sent to who ever you are transacting with. It takes a very long time for the person or company you are transacting with to be able to trust that they actually have the money. That's the real problem.
It is more simple with bank transfers. Here you actually send money, but it is also reflected in the time it takes banks to process bank transfers - usually around one to two weeks for international transfers.
After the bitcoin seller have actually received your fiat money, it can take as little as ten minutes before you have your bitcoins. And ten minutes later you could have paid someone else in bitcoins for goods or services. I think this shows nicely how Bitcoin is vastly superior to the fiat banking system.
As for the Russian services with poorly translated English and bad functionality, I think you have found some "bad eggs" that you should just avoid.

Thanks. I didn't know that. 
I wonder why it is nessesary to reference previous transactions. If you just referenced a sender address as input a node could easily figure out if the transaction was valid by looking at the blockchain and sum the ingoing and outgoing transactions of the address.

I don't really understand why Blockchain would ask you to pay such a high fee unless you are trying to make a transaction to or from a lot of addresses (I am guessing you are just trying to transfer from one address to another).
The main thing to understand about transaction fees is that it costs harddisk space and bandwith for the network to process a transaction. But after looking over the details of your address on blockchain, I don't see any reason why you should not be able to send your 0.07 bitcoins for a 0.0005 bitcoin fee.
If you want to send your bitcoins for free, use the "one-bitcoin-day" rule of thumb. Take the average number of days your bitcoins has been sitting in your wallet and multiply it with the total number of bitcoins in your wallet. If the result is bigger than 1 most miners will include the transaction for free. So if you have 24 bitcoins they only have to sit there for one hour before you can transfer them for free. Unfortunately your 0.07 bitcoins would have to sit there for over two weeks to qualify for the free transfer.

"Currency" is not very well defined. But there are a couple of attributes that makes something useful as a currency. 
Like: 
1. It loose as little value over time as possible: Pizza very bad, gold good, bitcoin good, fiat so-so.
2. It is easy and cheap to split up and recombine later without loosing the sum value: Gold and fiat pretty good. Bitcoin very good. Diamonds or cars bad.
3. It is easy and cheap to transport/transfer: Fiat so-so. Gold bad. Bitcoin very very good.
These are the main attributes and there are others, but I think it shows why Bitcoins are very good as a currency.

Indeed. It is easy to look back now and say "obviously Bitcoin was going to increase in value, the early investors got everything for free". But back then nobody knew if major bugs or fatal flaws in the protocol was right around the corner, which was very likely then, but much less likely today. People buying Bitcoins today are exposed to much less risk than people buying just one year ago, and therefor the price is higher today, and rightly so.

The Segway mostly failed because it got completely over-hyped and the company behind it failed to cut down the cost, and thereby the retail price, to anything resembling a favorable value proposition. Our *genius* patent system simultaneously prevented anyone else from doing a better job with the technology and Segway went nowhere fast and stayed there.
Email, online shopping, streaming video and online news escaped the patent touch of death and flourished thanks to competition. The same way that Bitcoin, as long as it lives, will have the alt-coins forcing it to improve or die. And if Bitcoin dies it will be replaced by something better.

The idea behind the blockchain is that every block of transactions builds on top of the previous block and it's unique signature. Any new Bitcoin install joining the network will first download the whole blockchain from other existing installations. Each block is validated based on the previous, so any missing transaction would make the validation fail. 
TL;DR Yes, all transactions are saved.

A copy is not scarce on the internet. A truly innovative bussiness will focus on what is scarce, and that is exactly what icarusholmes is doing.

PRISM relies on big central companies or controllers of communication networks to tap into all the information being sent over them. This is why Microsoft, Facebook and Google are obvious targets.
Bitcoin has no central company or controller, so it is not susceptible to central corruption. But every transaction is public, so you should not use Microsoft, Facebook or Google services (or any other service where the service provider can record your communication) to talk to anyone about the addresses you don't want the US government to know about.
Use a Jabber client with end-to-end encryption for instant messaging and Diaspora for your social networking.

Like I said, every hard fork creates a new bitcoin network. Nobody is forced to move or to stay on any of the networks, including the miners.
If, in theory, _all_ the miners left the "old" network, no transactions would confirm (be included in a block) because no blocks would be created. But any remaining miners would have increased profit because the difficulty would go down. You see this with miners "shopping around" between mining for the Bitcoin network and other "alt-coins" (slightly different implementations of bitcoin with their own ecosystem) depending on which network gives them the biggest return on their work.
And if most users left, you would not have many to trade bitcoins with. Even if absolutely all left the network you could in principle go back to the network and restart it all by your self. This is obviously not desirable, but again nobody is being forced in any way.
Miners are incentivised by making bitcoins from block rewards and from transfer fees. Both the value of the block rewards and the amount of transfer fees are determined by how many users are using the network. So collectively, users control miners to a much higher degree than vice versa.
Sorry for the wall of text. It turned out longer than I intended :) Hope it makes sense.

Essentially you are taking even more risk than if you just invest in bitcoins. Not only do you bet that bitcoins go up in value, you also bet that the company whos stocks you are buying will give a return on investment.
It's really the same as investing in any other company with any other currency, except that no other currency is as volatile as bitcoin right now. So we don't really think about it as investing in our local currency because that is what we measure everything else by - but it is essentially the same.

One of the best reasons why a 51% attack makes no sense. Mining is a very public affair, and if any unknown player got close to 51% most honest nodes would be ready to stop accepting work from this player. 
Also, a government attack also makes no sense. The government fear the idea of crytocurrencyp, not bitcoin itself. Even if they successfully kill bitcoin, another cryptocurrency will take its place. Because bitcoin has already proved that it work. And work very well.

For small amounts of money (which is not worth doing a double spend for) you don't need to have internet access to send bitcoins. 
You can send the internet provider a signed transaction from you to him, and he can check with his internet connection that your account has the required funds. If you decide to use his internet and run without paying, he can just broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network and take your money that way - that is his insurance.
This model has been discussed a couple of times on the [Let's talk Bitcoin]( podcast.

This is very true. But the way it works today, with credit card companies just letting bad customers do charge-backs like it's nobodys business, is also extremely unbalanced. So much so that most small specialty shops can only reliably serve first world western countries. At least the shop is a much more public entity and can quickly get a bad rep if they cheat too many customers.
The future I see is third party escrow service providers. Small unknown shops can use bigger escrow service providers to hold the bitcoins while the product is shipped, proving that the customer has the money, but not giving the money to the shop before the product is recieved. The escrow service providers will also mediate situations where the customer is not satisfied and can prove product errors or shortcomings.
By the way, that is more or less how Silk Road works... And all else aside, if there was ever a seller you should not trust with cash in the mail it would be an anonymous drug dealer. As far as I have heard customers on Silk Road are quite happy, so I think that shows a lot about what that kind of system is capable of.
Edit: Somehow managed to call an escrow service an "arbitrage service". Fixed.

It is stupid because it did not give the market time to adjust. 
There where many people selling at ~33$ and a good amount of people selling from that and up to 36$. Many probably didn't actively sell in the 33-36$ range because they could see that many other where, and didnt think that anyone would buy up to their price because that very rarely happens.
If the guy buying bitcoins did it in small increments over several days, the price would slowly go up and people would be more attracted to selling, thus keeping the price lower and saving the guy dollars.
**In other words, the guy did the equivalent of going to a potato market and yelling "SELL ME 5 THOUSAND POTAOES RIGHT NOW. I'LL PAY WHAT EVER YOU WANT" - of cause that is going to be more expensive than using a week to buy the cheapest potatoes and get the overall lowest price for the 5k potatoes.**

No "guaranteed" rate of return is higher that a loan accessible to the general public.

You are right that the bitcoin symbol is not in the ASCII table of characters. But neither was any other currency symbol except dollars ($) which is the ASCII character with decimal number 36.
The B with double vertical lines through it does not exist in any character set I know.
It has been proposed to just use the single vertical line same as the bath, reasoning that multiple use of currency characters is nothing new - take for example $ used for both USD, CAD, AUD and NZD, this is why we have the 3-letter identification. Personally I don't like that. I would prefer to use the double-vertical-lines-B whenever possible and BTC when constricted to a standard character set until the bitcoin symbol is adopted in a standard character set.
@_date: 2013-05-17 12:32:46
Well, isn't that good? Would you have preferred that the transaction went through twice and you transferred double the amount you wanted?
I honestly didn't know this was possible, because I thought that a new transaction would just use more bitcoins, but it kinda makes sense. Every transaction spend all the bitcoins from an address - the amount you want to the address you specify, and the rest to a new "change"-address in your own wallet. 
This means that you can make a new transaction which will in theory be a double spend attempt, but ofcause only one of them will be accepted and when the new transaction with fees gets accepted the other one gets rejected and you are have the transaction you want.
@_date: 2013-05-28 11:27:17
After reading up on the transaction protocol I now understand that the previous transactions must be referenced individually in any new transaction.

I wrote nothing of the sort, I only wrote that it happens. But to argue your straw man, it happens &gt;95% of the time. The point is that money is not a stationary thing.


I absolutely share your excitement, and I cannot tell you that your opinion on images of physical bitcoins are wrong. But the question was if it would help people understand Bitcoin, and I think that it does. 
Most people understand fiat money in terms of coins and bills. Either you have it or you don't. Only one person can have it in his/her hand at any time. If it belongs to you, then it really BELONGS to you. This is a really powerful concept. One of the main features of bitcoin is that it cannot be copied (unlike most things living on computers). And when you own it, nobody can take it away from you.
Of cause, as both of us know, there are multiple exceptions to the above. But for me it is part of the essence of what Bitcoin strives for and comes closer than any other currency I know of. People can always research the whys and the hows of the bitcoin implementation details - but most will not and I don't think those who do will be stopped by a couple of coin images.

If the current system really worked and was not used as a tool for censorship (just google "Rojadirecta censorship" for a good example) you would be totally right.

The difference is that with traditional banking you trust the bank with all your money instead of taking responsibility for your own money as you do with Bitcoin.
In essence traditional banking is good if your system gets compromised and someone tries to steal your money. The bank can (usually and if you can convince them) reverse the transaction because they are in complete and undisputed control of the system.
The problems with traditional banks are that because you give them complete control over your money they can:
* Freeze your account and deny you access to your money
* Take what ever fees they deem appropriate
* Block you from sending money to people or organizations they don't like
* Record and tell government agencies who you transact with (which you can later get punished for, if it is someone they don't like)
* Simply steal your money if they have financial troubles (like in Cyprus)
But at least they will mostly refund petty money lost from hacking to try to convince people that their system is "safe".

Sorry, but that's wrong. Connection between you and StrongCoin is encrypted. Further, as far as I know StrongCoin is not part of PRISM and they also only ever see an encrypted version of your Bitcoin wallet.
On StrongCoin, BlockChain etc. your Bitcoin Wallet is encrypted via JavaScript in your browser so you don't have to trust them with your unencrypted wallet. The obvious weakness is if an attacker or the service themselves changes the JavaScript code and make it send the unencrypted wallet. This however, is easy to detect and is the reason for browser plugins like the one for BlockChain which checks and makes sure that the JavaScript is not altered. But this weakness has nothing to do with PRISM.

Today houses are very expensive because money is losing value. People are able to pay off huge loans because the loan is worth less and less as time goes by. This doesn't create more houses, this just makes houses more expensive. Basic supply and demand.
Tomorrow, with bitcoins, houses will be much cheaper (compared to average salary) because everyone will have less (but more valuable) money. Rates could be 20% p.a. - but if that is the rate for everyone, demand for houses go down and therefor the price goes down.
Yes, it will encourage people to save up and think before they buy. But I think that is a good thing (and a whole other discussion), and it does not stop anyone borrowing money. It just reveals the real price of lending when you don't have a government continuously destroying the value of your money.


You could ask the same thing about fiat, just inversed. Tomorrow it will be worth more or less the same, in 20 years it will be worth a lot less, and in 50 years it will be worth almost nothing. How do we decide how much things are worth in fiat? The market finds a price based on how fast we can pass it on to the next sucker. Inversely, bitcoins will find a value based on how long time we are willing to wait for it to rise in price.

I wholeheartedly agree. I think that BlockChain is one of the most userfriendly services for bitcoin transactions currently, but they could absolutely improve on this point. It should not require intimate knowledge of the protocol just to do a transaction that happens to be slow to get confirmed.

The ting is, Apple could easily protect it's customers by warning them instead of forbidding specific behavior. There is no advantage in Apples closed system which could not also be implemented in an open system.
Make sure that you show your customers exactly where the safe zone is and where the unsafe zone is. If you go outside the safe zone you are on your own. If you stay inside, you have all the advantages of the closed garden. Everyone wins.
But Apple don't want that. They want to tell me what I can and cannot do with the phone I own, and make perfectly reasonable use cases impossible in the process. This I cannot forgive, and thus I am no longer their customer.

All value gain is subjective and depends on what store of value your perspective is tied to.
If your perspective is dollars, then you can only reasonably say that you have gained value if you end your transactions with more dollars than you started with. If you never end your transactions with dollars you can't say that you have gained any dollars. You might have gained other things, like if you buy bitcoins for dollars, wait a while and buy two beers instead of only the one you could get with your original dollars. Then you gained a beer, but how many dollars is a beer? That's completely subjective and just because 10 people have bought beer for 1$, it does not mean that that is the price you would have had to pay if you bought a beer.

Short answer: Yes
Long answer: Yes, but more unlikely than two people randomly choosing the same grain of sand from planet Earth.

It would be a problem if you want to spend the bitcoins that your customers paid to all the addresses. When you make a bitcoin transaction, each extra "from-address" costs additional transaction fee because the data that describes the transaction is bigger and the cost of saving it in the blockchain is proportional with the amount of data.
Using all the money from all the 100 million addresses would probably cost the equivalent of over $100.000 in transaction costs.

Every time the price seem to go on an express elevator to space, I spend some coins on interesting things like:
* [The Roast Station Project]( (Gourmet coffee beans from Bali)
* [Sean's Outpost]( (Homeless outreach and pioneers in non-profit Bitcoin Organizations)
* [Let's Talk Bitcoin]( (Very interesting Bitcoin talkshow/podcast with their own @_date: 2013-05-28 11:12:50
Thanks. I think what confuses people (incl. me) is when you write "input: &lt;your_address&gt;". It is misleading because each input **must** reference the transaction that transferred it to &lt;your_address&gt;.
