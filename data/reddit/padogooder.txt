Listen, you’re right. It’s stupid and unfunny and immature. 
But so is, like, all the best things- the same could be said about things you like, I’m sure. The question is, why do you feel the need to tell us that? Why does *our* immaturity bother you? I suggest it’s probably because you take appearing smart and mature very seriously, and don’t like that being part of this group requires dropping some of that facade. 
But it’s ok. You do you. I’m gonna have a little fun with life and enjoy the memes that I enjoy.

Ripple has gone up 40 cents since you said that.  I’ve made 15% of my portfolios value in the last week trading between XRP and BTC. it’s not idiocy- it’s analysis. Ripple has more optimism around it right now than BTC which means the price is going up.

No one knows. There is no technical definition or ability to forecast a bubble from trend analysis. The question is: does the price drop or does it plateau? Does it drop catastrophically for a reason (such as the subprime credit bubble), because its lost steam, or does it snowball because of profit taking and then FUD? No one knows. 
Me? I’m staying in and buy as much as I can for the next foreseeable future, regardless of price.

You figured it out, I’m one of the designers of this toy. Hey records the price every five minutes and stores 1000 minute moving average. If then checks the current price and compares it to that moving average and angles the roller coaster depending on whether or not the price is above or below that. 
One percent produces a roughly 15 degre eangle and a temper cent increase produces a 90. The other guy did most of the math, but it’s logarithmic.

There’s a price floor with mining. You can always mine for some coins if the price is too high to afford,  that is, it might be cheaper to mine then to just buy.
With mining becomes harder, and thus more expensive, that floor rises.

Volatility and speculation have nothing to do with each other. I get that you’re trying to preach what you think of “responsibility”, but all you’re going on is the vaguest understanding of investment principles. 
Bitcoin may or may not be a wise investment. The growth in value offers some data, but the real question is in use cases. I’m not listening to any naysayers who doesn’t speak about use cases.  For now, it’s apparent to me that bitcoin has first mover advantage in a new economy that is only barely nascent now.

You’ll want to consult a pro at that point, but I’m nearly certain that would still be a taxable event and you’d calculate the price the dollars would be and pay gains on them.

My family has experienced a windfall in the last few years and gone from solid working middle class to upper middle class with a little bit liquid for investment, enough to have an advisor. 
I’ve been telling my parents to put a little bit into BTC since it was 2800. They finally listened at 15k. Mom mentioned it to her financial advisor and he literally *hadn’t heard of bitcoin*. She had to try to tell him about it, only knowing what she had been able to get from me. I feel like I should have a meeting with the guy and charge him $100 an hour for training.

@_date: 2017-12-14 07:28:07
So two things: 
1. Once you have bought a contract, you can then sell it. If I buy a contract that allows me to buy a commodity for $100 in two weeks, someone might offer me $110 for the contract tomorrow, knowing the extra 10 bucks might be worth the extra profit. 
2. You might buy these instead of bitcoin for reasons of liquidity- it’s easier to buy this contract than an actual bitcoin. You can also get these on margin- 44% of the price- so you can leverage your cash holdings further.

1. Sentiment isn’t a great indicator of price. Hard to track effectively. 
2. For every person I know who thinks BTC’s growth is unlimited, I know 1 person who thinks there’s some reasonable growth, 2 that think it’s a bubble, 5 that think it’s a scam, and 100 who think it’s fake magic  imaginary internet money.

I don't even think it's good currency or means of payment yet. 
It's a damn good speculative investment still; and it will become a currency as it is more widely adopted... which is why it's such a good speculative investment now.

I've said this other places: 5.8 million dollars per BTC equates to a 121 trillion dollar market cap. 
That's substantially more value than there is in the world. The only possible way that happens is if the dollar drops to meaninglessness.

@_date: 2017-08-06 10:30:06
You're thinking about the wrong way. Yes- making a purchase of 1 bitcoin for 3100 or 3300 or 2300 isn't that big a deal, but if you're buying 1,000 dollars worth of BTC, that could be .4, .5, or .6 BTC. 
That is an incredible difference in the long run. You want to buy as much as possible when it is low.

Ugh. I was paying attention- I’m playing futures, 20x on deribit- and caught the 7500 to 7800, though it was surely going to hit 8, set my sell order and looked away. 
Poof, dropped to 7300 and forced a margin call. Lost all my gains from last night. Gotta grind it out again.  
Don’t be too sad, it was like 50 bucks. I’m a little guppy.

I actually changed my mind about 11:30, shorted ETH/BTC.  my short was doing well, but ETH started moving up a bit before I hit my sell target (I set a price so I could sleep). Lowest BTC price in the last day was 68 and a half or so. I was off. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:36:36
.02 was the minimum winning bid.

It means you’ll have to buy it from someone else- mining will no longer create new BTC.

If something over here costs $1, and over there sells for three dollars, and the trip. Esteem here and there costs $.25, then you can double your money- just buy here, move there, and sell there.  Come back here and repeat. 
However, this also means you increase demand over and supply over there, so an efficient market will close the gap until there is no advantage.

Is mining really useless at the point? I did the most cursory of google searches and see that I could get some 3.6 BTC a year for running an ant miner. 
Am I underestimating power costs, over estimating output?

I feel like like you think you know what these words mean and assemble them into coherent sentences, but don’t actually know what you’re talking about. Crypto is volatile- yes. The stock market had a bad day- yes.

This is less a bitcoin question and more a question of financial planning. I would go to /personalfinance and ask them. I would be specific about not looking for a debate on the validity of crypto. 
They will give you some good advice on how to diversify, which is really what you want to do here. They will also probably give you a more realistic view of crypto as an investment. 
For my personal 2cents, I would never think of holding even close to all of my investments in crypto or any other one thing. I can only justify the risky investments I'm making in crypto because I am young and live cheaply. 
Your going to want to cash out an amount that makes sense with capital gains and your tax situation. I would consider moving a large portion of your bitcoin earnings into a bitcoin IRA- pay taxes now while it's cheap and get your growth for free. 
I would actually hesitate to cash out BTC to pay anything but the most onerous debts. If you cash out a bitcoin today to pay 5k in credit card debt, that debt might be 6500 next year, but BTC might be at 10k a coin. You lose money in that situation- but this isn't just a question of math, but of emotional state. What debts can you live with for a while and what do you want gone now? 
Get thee to r/personalfinance and r/financialindependence. 
Congrats.

It would be... not difficult... to pair this toy with a raspberry pi and a small display to have a constant ticker price, plus a servo that rotates the coaster through a vertical 180 degree axis as an approximation for rise. The faster it's rising/falling, the steeper the incline. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:02:13
If you're serious, I could figure out how to produce and sell a small run of them. I don't know anything about the technicals, but I have crowdfunding experience and access to a micromanufacrure facility. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:36:09
It's always worthwhile to see the price as Xxxx USD/ BTC to reinforce that it's an exchange rate, a relative position between two things. 
Hell- the dollar could plummet (October debt limit is coming!) and blow the usd/BTC exchange though the roof and leave the EUR/BTC price essentially unchanged, theoretically. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:11:41
 What do you think you would take? I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it to actually produce a few.

I’m buying $100 a week for the foreseeable future, not all in BTC (not that it matters as tightly as the alts are reflecting BTC), but that’s where I’m at. I can lose it all,  but at this point, no one can call the bottom, which is the time to display the virtue of CDA.

What do you think would be a reasonable price? Trying to explore if I should actually pursue this idea or not.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:05:13
I'll be back with the math. 
Edit: there's about 5.28 billion ounces of gold in the world. Gold currently trading at about 1300 USD per ounce.  That means there's about $6.8 trillion worth of gold out there.
If all of the bitcoins are available, and the bit coin Was the same as the gold, a bitcoin would be worth just over $300,000.
I do not find this likely in the near or medium term.

Yes. This is true. 
You’ll note, if you are capable of reading english, that I asked “why?”  
It’s all down, yes, but what is causing the correlation. I don’t think I’ve seen the crypto and stock markets be related infraday before.

So the limiting factor there is the coin figurine and coding the processor. I think it *could* be done with not much hassle, but the BTC people are the biggest market. If you wanted to put in a bid and won, we’d figure it out for you, I think.

Those numbers do not go into the tables in the form you see them.

Perfect! That's great feedback. It is a bit more complicated than those parts, but I'm glad you see the value. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:14:59
1. I don't think the components we are using now will support changing prices between cryptos or other currencies. I imagine we could program them to show BTC/EUR pretty easily when we build it. Good thought- will add to dev list. 
2. We're still thinking about pricing, but thinking somewhere around .018 BTC including shipping. What would you pay?  Crowdfunding isn't that attractive- we'd rather take payment in BTC and we don't really need start-up capital. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:44:36
Yup- we'll make the sales while we can and let the Chinese do their thing when they catch on. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:10:11
I appreciate it. I know that I am bumbling about without a lot of knowledge on parts of this- I am confident, though, that this puzzle is solvable and gives access to a wallet with BTC in it. 
If someone solves it or finds a mistake rendering the puzzle unsolvable, I'll happily send them the prize manually. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:03:08
I'm not arguing with the blockchain, I don't know why block explorer says the wallet is empty. Perhaps I misunderstand the outputs from breadwallet.

@_date: 2017-10-05 16:32:02
I *beleive* I have encoded enough information into this puzzle that one would control the wallet entirely, not just be able to pull  BTC from it. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:40:24
My point is that this very nearly measures value now from value *before it had value*, so the 5m% number especially is kinda useless mathematically.

And it's a good one, we appreciate it.

@_date: 2017-10-28 19:15:59
But just before someone found a use case, it’s use was zero. The first time a human made a trinket of gold, value was established as exactly one trinket- it’s minute, just like the first usecase of bitcoin. 
Both started at zero, and that fact makes this math spurious. 
What I’m saying is that the value of something in its growth phase isn’t useful data... and we won’t know the growth phase is over until it is. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:43:08
*good* questions. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:15:09
That part where assange points out a new website and don say he’ll look into it, then does, is proof they were working together.  
But you know what? The truth will out. I don’t give a shit if you agree with me, as long as Mueller is working. If he finds nothing, I’ll happily eat my words. If he comes down with proof of conspiracy to commit treason, money laundering, and fraud... will you do the same?

Collusion isn’t a legal term. What you’re looking for is “conspiracy”. Collusion means “working together” and these DM’s clearly show them working together to mutual ends. 
But you don’t care about facts, clearly.

No, it's not. It's a membership fee. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:11:03
You mean "the estate tax"? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:32:01
You will get the amount of bitcoin you paid for at the price you paid for it when you ordered. 
For example, at time T, you order 100 dollars of bitcoin, which is equal to about .05 BTC at the time you ordered it. After the processing period, you will get .05 BTC for your 100 dollars. 
However, if the price changes during the processing time, that .05 BTC might be worth some different amount of dollars. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:38:35
Are you kidding me? Have you even logged into coinbase? Go look at the price swings in just the last 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:23:47
But you still have .5 bitcoin. "Dollar" is not synonymous with "money". If what you are trying to buy costs .5 btc, then you can still buy it, so who cares what the relationship to BTC and USD is? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:43:44
You won't have any dollars left. You will have bitcoin. You would have about .195 bitcoin.  If, in six days, bitcoin is worth $1,000 per BTC, then you still have ..195 BTC- but it will only be worth about 180 dollars. 
If bitcoin is worth $2500 per BTC, then you still ALSO have .195 BTC, but it's worth about 450 bucks. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:44:39
Then it's really stupid to try to buy things with a currency that fluctuates minute by minute. BTC isn't a currency right now. It's an investment vehicle. 
But also- if you're trying to purchase things with BTC, you won't lose BTC. dollars are no longer relevant if you're trying to exchange BTC for goods or services. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:29:31
The two concepts are totally distinct. You would hope that people value that which is useful, but they don't do so all the time.

Missing a K, then? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:46:35
No. It is simply the desire of people to have something that makes it valuable. Desire is different than usefulness. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:45:31
Yeah, I git brigaded by them a few days ago. Such bullshit.

No one knows. In the next 12 hours? Probably. Maybe. Unless you're trying to get the best price possible, just do the transaction. Unless the seller changes the price in BTC, you should be fine.

His version of masculinity is just a mitigated, wordy version of the “western chauvinism” that the proud boys claim so they can claim to not be a hate group. 
His version of “individualism” is just creating villains out of those who wish to share a joint society- a version of white male supremacy that takes racial and sexual privilege so for granted that it is ineffable.

So power and access to the things a human needs is completely equal in America? 
No people more likely to be jailed?

He’s fascist adjacent, at least. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:15:51
Worked perfectly! Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:58:30
What's that situation look like? 
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:36:32
Is there anywhere to short BTC against the dollar?
@_date: 2019-05-05 02:56:47
Deny his fascistic ass a route to get paid for his bullshit racism? 
Yes, they should.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:38:24
The rumsfeldian unknowns, yes. What are your thoughts on the systemic risks in BTC? 
@_date: 2018-12-31 04:33:45
How many are in the top ten? I’ve seen three in my main scroll. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:41:57
I'M IN. coinbase, stop sucking. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:59:18
Does anyone agree? This is my concern as well- I have no idea what the likelihood is, but I recognize it as a possibility. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:48:19
I just saw how down BTC is on the day. There might be something I don't see. I'm hoping the drop maintains another day- I get paid tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:09:49
But none of that mean my BTC are valueless, just that I don't have my BTC anymore. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:11:12
thanks! That's really useful. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:28:16
Ooooh! That's a fun number. Maybe I should hold off- I was licking my lips at 2,500. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:58:31
I mean, a million dollar coin means a 1 dollar satoshi, so really you only need one more digit.

You're right- I misread the hundred in "hundred millionth". 
Even better. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:43:11
I could stand seeing 2500 and making 18% in the next few months. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:54:55
People seeing 3000 as all time high and locking in their insane profits from the last 2-3 months. I'm buying cost average weekly from here out until at least 10,000. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:15:11
Oh well! I already know the phrase people are going to get tired of me saying:
"I got into bitcoin around 2200." 
Let's have a bad week every two years. I like fire sales. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:06:04
The real problem is that the tense doesn't match. To flop the letters in "sell" you get "sell". I propose slel. Rhymes with hell. Starts with the phoneme as sled. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:30:45
Cost average purchases. BTC goes up, have more value, BTC goes down, get more coinage.

Every person who has gotten out of bitcoin thinking they've maxed their profits has been wrong so far.

Adjacent means “beside” or “near”. In the common parlance, it’s means “almost” “nearly” or “associated with”.

@_date: 2017-06-13 13:27:27
This is something I don't understand. Let's say you own 1.0 bitcoin at 250k and you have a method of payment for daily items that draws against that coin. 
At 250k a coin, a 10 dollar burger and fries will cost you 4/100,000 of a coin. Do coins even break down that far? 
Just looked a little harder, and apparently that's just 4 bits. Ok- I can deal with that.

Could you eli5 scaling?

Yes. This is better. Sodl'd. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:50:37
Did you mean to say "bitmain" there? Also- thanks so much for a cogent explanation. I've been trying to understand for a few days and you got me there. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:47:39
Are you sure? 10/250,000 is .00004
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:36:40
I'm gonna cost average weekly across this period and see how it goes.

It might be worth some amount of gold.

So what's the real floor? Am I looking at buying something that loses 90% of its value by Christmas? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:38:06
I have coinbase right now- I see concerns, but I'm so limited in my exposure right now that ease of learning is my priority. Ill learn more in the next weeks-
Anyway- I'll be splitting my investments (and we're talking 10's of dollars for now) between CB's  three coins. I like etherium, and litecoin is so cheap. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:36:58
I think we'll see 2950 sometime this weekend or early next week. I think we'll be bouncing between 2700 and 3000 until July. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:11:58
I'm not even waiting for the dip- I'm just waiting on coinbase to verify my account. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 03:14:50
The fact that you think there’s anyone advocating for gay people to be treated specially betrays the point. It isn’t identity politics to advocate for equal rights. 
It is, however, fascistic to create second-class citizens out of people who are different sexually. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:45:05
You've waivered, what, 15%?   CHILL THE FUCK OUT.

I don't know what you are trying to do, but you do not seem to have the kind of grasp on how this works that I would want in doing a transaction. It sounds to me like you are at high risk of being scammed. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:46:17
Understanding satoshis (to be honest, I thought a Sat was like an eighth or 8 hundredths for some reason) reinforced that even I can get in, 10 bucks at a time. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 22:41:50
“Identity politics” is a dog whistle. It means “anyone who wants to change the political balance for those with identities who are being discriminated against or oppressed”. 
So advocates for gay rights are playing identity politics- according to the terminology of those who use the term. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:54:08
Yes. That. Exactly.
