So besides signing a deal with Mt Gox and then promptly suing them for breaking said deal, can anyone tell me what Coinlab has done? It seems like they have just made promises to fund start-ups they either think up or pay someone to think up, and then delegate all tasks possible.

Good to see PV vendors finally starting to wise up and dumping the ridiculous payment providers that mistreated them for so long.
By the looks of things, Shopify has to add the gateway themselves because of their proprietary nature. Have you considered moving your site over to an open source platform?

Is Bitcoin illegal? Of course not. However, especially now that there is [precedence]( Bitcoin is the same as any other currency in the eyes of US legislation. If what you are doing is illegal to do with cash, then it is just as illegal with Bitcoin.
Given that information, we can surmise that mining is therefore legal. However, mining also counts as money earned, [so that opens up an entirely different debate](
Summary: It isn't about the currency, but what you do with it that defines legality.

I can't tell if this is a general parody of conspiracy theory shows on TV, or if this is just another conspiracy theory show...

This is the unfortunate part of the ecig market in my experiences. It appears that most of the end users, although passionate, are older and not terribly tech savvy. However, if your business is Slumberland Industries as your name would suggest, I'm honestly quite surprised that the RBA community isn't willing to embrace Bitcoin a bit more. Do you generally find your customers to be tech-savvy people?

I really like LTCs increased transaction speed. I spent a week or two playing around with some Litecoin gambling sites and exchanges, and got so used to the fast confirms that I found myself annoyed with waiting when I went back to Bitcoin. Of course, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere as the top cryptocurrency, but I would like to see more Litecoin integration into sites that already accept Bitcoin, if only for days when I don't want to wait 10-20 minutes for a confirm.
