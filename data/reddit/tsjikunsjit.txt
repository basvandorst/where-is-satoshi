Thanks. It is an interesting thought. Right now we managed to put the btc in cold storage on an offline computer with Armory

It is very sudden. It is an extension of a planned nuclear summit. Obama has suddenly called for an extra G7 meeting, without R. !!(G8) It will happen in The Hague. Lots of world leaders shall be there..but no Putin..

This is really funny! Didn't know this connotation in English. However, to me he is just my uncle in The Netherlands..speaking Dutch. Does that have a double meaning as well?

We should feel some pitty for her. It is not very pleasant for her to know she's not a very talented journalist.

Spending is investing. Spend btc and buy them back for fiat immediately.

Huh, I got tipped? Why..? Random? How does that work? 
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:49:50
Perhaps it is because China and Russia made an energy deal, payed in local currency. Meaning the petrodollar is compromised. We may expect more of such deals.. If I would be someone having large capitals stored in USD, I guess I would get the hell out and buy gold or (even better) ..bitcoins

this is saying a lot about mr Wang's credibility

That sounds logic. Thanks. So when that happens that could evoke another recession in the US?
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:10:19
The nuclear summit brings representatives of most countries to The Hague, ofcourse the sudden economic meeting of the G7 will only involve seven countries. But.. As I said, it is G7 not G8. Putine is not invited. Talks will be today about the economic sanctions towards R. 
This is not propaganda..please I don't like it when someone tries to 'frame' my words and give it a different connotation. Just telling what is happening. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:07:38
Yes I know about the agreement a few weeks ago, but it seems the Financial Times are shaking this up again, based on recent quotes from the CEO of the Deutsche Bank, based in Russia. And also one of the heads of another bank, the Russian statebank VTB. 
So this is no news?
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:42:15
I can not respond to the details of what started the crisis in the Ukraine. There is no right or wrong here, but I can see there is something building up. NATO has been surprised by these moves from Russia, surely they have admitted that publicly. I think we should keep our eyes fixed on this G7 meeting, because it can have a drastic spin off. If Putin is well prepared, he may try to shift power on the energymarket, refusing the dollar as a currency, therefore throwing down the cardhouse. I can not predict the outcome, but for one it will have an effect on the dollar, and I bet that evolves into another recession.

He may write whatever he wants, but he'll never get it. We're done with these guys. Even IF any stateregulator should get a grip on Bitcoin, It's still so easy to move over to another cryptocurrency. Reality will bite him one day..

Very strange. Since one of their own members of the board (and former minister of Finance) has confessed that he himself owns some bitcoin. His name is Jan Kees de Jager

Can they really do that? I've read an article (date 4th of March) quoting one of Vl.Putin's advisors, and he is saying this could be a logical course of action for Russia if "the west" decides to maintain the economic sanctions. What currency would replace the dollar then..?

Local elections will be on wednesday. This is yet a small local party trying to gain attention. Still ..it's an interesting message
Edit: however spending bicoins on taxes seems kind of a waste ..

Buy and spend btc. And earn them by starting a business. Hold some for later puposes, investment or savings. Isn't this obvious?
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:13:17
Yes, we all know this..but it seems some powerfull people in this world are now taking action. I'm not an economist, so I have to ask about this. As for now, I got some short anwers but no explenation. The dollar is inflationary, but what will cathalise it's downfall?

I've seen him work once on some really rough material. Very cool, and large paintings. ..while his stereo cried out with Metal. And one week later he was all into Tiffany horses, on Chopin.. You can talk with him for hours on allmost any subject. He's cool.

Obvious fact, please make no illusions. By nature the bitcoin network counters any communist economy. That will likely become one of it's main features. I never believe China will adopt it, however ..we can.

Yes, there is a website, but personally I think his best work is just in some corner in his workshop. That's where this guy was looking and became enthousiastic. Reinier-art.nl

It's understandable. However, this is part of the ride, brother. Lots of thing are going on and this reddit is only a part of the information you get. Just remember that you should not look at the price too much. Some day bitcoin will be it's own standard. I hope you will put your future wealth for the benefit of others.

You should meet him, he is a nice man, but very independent. Runs in the family btw.

If the G7 decides this week on increasing economic sanctions towards R. Then an energycrisis may evolve from that, with a (yet unpredictable) impact on the dollar as a tradingcurrency. Is this a dellusional prospect? Sorry, I am not a native speaking English, though not ignorant for the signs

WB has no significance in my country, north of Europe. Could we just ignore this man? Instead of recycling his  old school misinterpretations on this subreddit over and over again?
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:18:08
why? 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:21:16
Btc may become significant in the next economical crisis. When this will happen is speculative, but we should keep our eyes fixed on the G7 meeting in The Hague this week.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:59:50
Who are you. How can we trust you. Can you Give som guarantees and If so..by what authority. Authority..Hm that sounds a bit scary too..
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:07:08
Seems to me this is very likely to happen. I tried to explain this to the people around me, and I get this glazing look.. But the next few weeks will be crucial considdering this scenario. 
Edit: If this is so obvious..why isn't this whole subreddit buzzing about this news?!!
@_date: 2014-12-16 07:40:02
This video really moved me. Anyone can see they are so poor, and placing their hopes on a better future. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:46:40
So we should not focus on 'the news', but see what is actually happening? Is there any difference btw? What If the US and EU increase their sanctions towards R.? Would that have an effect on the energymarket? Would that have an effect on the petrodollar? Would that influance the demand 'safe' stores of value?
Maybe this is a delusional line of questioning..so please anyone, if you disagree, tell me how
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:11:46
How could this effect Europe? Seems to me that, besides for a run on stabile assets like gold or btc, there wil be a increasing shortage on energy as well? Do you believe this to be likely to happen now? I guess If Putin's a leader who is steeking for more power, this time he may push through..
