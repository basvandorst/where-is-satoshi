This is the best one I've seen.

Gotta start somewhere. You expect it to adopt itself?
I'd say it's more like putting your sovereign, borderless, censorship-resistant, state-free, decentralized, digital wallet on the table and trying to work out the bugs. 
You can't just count on lightning saving BTC and not using it.

I haven’t lost any. One of my best friends once sent $15k worth of BTC to an LTC address. Luckily, it all got sorted out and he didn’t lose any funds.

Not so. There are ways to retrieve it. Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin. I don’t know the details on how it was recovered because it was through Coinbase. He contacted the support and went from there. 
I’ve heard other stories of people recovering funds from the exact same scenario. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:53:06
Probably. They didn’t have Bitcoin.

Because all others are useless and provide no real utility.

You mad bro? Why?

The people did. The idea remained.

Glad you liked it. ���� After Effects.

The men died. The idea remained.

Not sure why everyone thinks it’s so hard to use lightning. It’s getting easier every day. 
1. Download Bluewallet.io 
2. Create a BTC seed wallet
3. Transfer BTC to that wallet
4. Create a Lightning wallet
5. Transfer BTC from seed wallet to Lightning wallet
6. Spend and receive using Lightning

A paper wallet: 
Or a hardware wallet: 
Or any other wallet where you have your private keys: 
Off of an exchange. If you don’t have your keys, they’re not your coins.

Interesting. I would try updating the app if you can. If not, I’m sure it’s coming very shortly. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:21:20
You can open more than 1 channel per on chain transaction. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:34:22
I’ll just refer you here:
 
You’re really rude, and obviously don’t want a discussion, so if you have anymore questions, just go ahead and fuck off.��
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:57:29
Yea, you probably shouldn’t invest in things that you don’t understand. 
You can’t inflate transaction fees because you will just be routed around by lower fee nodes. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:11:29
Yes. Download Bluewallet.io. 
Send some BTC to the BTC wallet. 
Send 1 on-chain transaction to the lightning wallet. 
Spend. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:41:52
Why not?
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:33:02
Lightning is off-chain. It doesn’t have a block size.

We’ll add you to the list.

Most people care about the security of their money. That’s what hash power is. It’s a massive feature. 
Why is the LN not usable? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:15:51
You can say that it isn’t legitimate all you want...and I’ll keep paying for things with it.����‍♂️
