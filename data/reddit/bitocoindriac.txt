You can hold and when you want to buy something with bitcoin you buy some bitcoins at the days price and spend them at pretty much the same price immediately, that way you can still have some savings in BTC and take advantage if the price goes up

again, this is just to give someone a little something, maybe 50 cents or something, just to get them started with a little bitcoin, I make it clear that they should not put money in it, only take it out when they want to have a secure wallet of their own. You have no idea how hard it is to get bitcoins where I live and some people might want them but might be afraid to get started, also some of my friends have Iphones, and if I want to give them a little it's better this way if we are out and they don't have a phone that can take bitcoins.

that is my point exactly, as someone that has followed and believe in bitcoin for a while it is easy to think we are at the tipping point, that is our point of view but we are far from it, since i first heard about bitcoin a year ago, i have looked at coinmap and it has gone from 2 to 3 businesses accepting it, i know Argentina is way ahead of the game, but damn if you live there I'm sure if you talk to the first person you find on the street they would have no idea what you are talking about when you  say the word bitcoin, again, not a bad thing, we are ahead in the game.

yes once you put the private key online, and is no loger pure cold storage, what you would do if you want to use some of your bitcoin from cold storage and keep the rest again in cold storage, you would have to grab some bitcoins from that cold storage use the ones you where going to use and now transfer the rest of the funds to another paper wallet which private keys have not been online now you are again in cold storage.

ebay, paypal and apple do not fully approve bitcoin, they have only dipped their toes in the water up till now, now DISH those guys had the fucking cojones to go ahead and accept bitcoin, yes they turn it into fiat, but that is to be expected because bitcoin is not widely accepted, if i go out of my house right now, and ask the first 10 people i meet on the street what is bitcoin, i bet 10 out of 10 have no fucking idea of what i am talking about.

I was trying to point out the fact that money is a very useful invention made by man, but money itself holds no value, the only reason money has value is because we give it value, so if we decide that bitcoin has value then it will be worth something, of course it has to have certain properties.

The point was not so much that the price fell or did not fall, the issue is when you compare bitcoin to the tulip mania, and that is the reason you give for an imminent fall, then you are insulting the people that have actually put in the time to understand why Bitcoin is not like the tulip mania or beanie babies.

Its good that you reached your goal, but a piece of advice, whenever you want to buy something in amazon or anywhere where you can do it with bitcoin, try to buy new bitcoins and use those to make your purchase, that way you are not exposed to the volatility, and keep the bitcoin economy liquid

Even if you use different passwords, password strength might be an issue, i recommend you use a password generator like keepass or last pass. also keep in mind that keepass uses a local encrypted file to save all your passwords, i keep this file stored both in my computer and in the cloud in case my computer is destroyed my passwords are not lost. its ok to keep it in the cloud because that file is un accessible without the main password.

Intrinsic means it has value because it is useful, if you are dying of thirst a bottle of water will be priceless to you, but if you can get drinking water from the tap, you would probably not pay me $1000 for that bottle of water, bitcoin has intrinsic value because it is a payment network and a way to transfer money over the internet, but at the same time, like gold, it has value because it is limited and scarce.

if you had a computer that has been compromised, and has some sort of remote access to it, then someone could steal your private keys, just like they can steal your email password. a paper wallet is not required, it is a feature and an option you have, usually one used by people that might have large amounts of money on their wallets, think of a paper wallet as some sort of safe, if you have $20 don't bother with any of that, use a wallet on your phone and carry it with you, but if you had $10000 then you would not go out with that amount of money on the streets with you, you might want to look into paper wallets and all that jazz then.

the only reason Bitcoin ATM's are so complicated is because they have to comply with stupid laws, this is a good example of an ATM where you do not have to have a scan of your veins, then submit a valid ID then have your picture taken, then have a human see if the picture of your face matches the one on the ID then give a valid phone number..........
Not to worry people like the guys at mycelium already came up with a good solution where we are all ATM's and when regulators realize that they can't regulate this, they will likely just give up.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:59:28
since there are many different wallet programs or online wallets, they are just all different, just like if you have a gmail and a yahoo mail, the buttons might be located in different places but usually they are very straight forward and say something like: send bitcoin. request bitcoin, your adress. and so on, maybe you should download a wallet and open it up, it will be empty so you can poke around on the different buttons it has.
very hard to help you step by step because we do not know if you have a wallet on a mac or a pc or a phone or what wallet in particular on any of those devices, don't be afraid and download a wallet and open the program. if on some sort of computer try multibit or blockchain wallet that would be my suggestion 
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:10:14
Bitcoin price is not higher on Mtgox, it is just the value of the US dollar is very low on gox, because if you have dollars on gox, you can't use them immediately, you cant withdrawal them and spend them, so basically, BITCOIN ON GOX IS WORTH THE SAME, IT IS JUST THE $  THAT IS WORTH LESS.

If the US dollar where to crash that would mean all currencies that are not affected by whatever made the dollar crash, the euro should remain at higher levels so would the yen and so on, also bitcoin should not change much compared to the euro or others but it would go up in value compared to the dollar.

I was thinking just yesterday how you can't use the flashlight to scan QR codes in the dark thanks guys, another feature that i think could be useful would be to be able to pick more than one main currency to see the exchange from the send window, right now I can toggle at the push of a button between USD and BTC, but it would be great to have the option that with a third push I could also see the price say in Mexican pesos for example.

you are right, the "dollar" the US is the biggest consumer in the world, and if you have a financial crisis the economy of any country that depends on selling their products to the us will suffer. but i suspect there will be more unemployment poverty the gdp would go down, however the currency would take a lesser hit, but yes they would suffer to a degree.

If you are worried about it, you can always create an Empty wallet, and post the public key to that wallet as your donation tip jar, if it is empty there is nothing to steal there anyways. However as long as all you are only giving your public key then it is also safe.

the public key is like your email adress, you can give that to anyone, post it on facebook or even here, and all people can do with that is send you money. the private key which the wallet handles is like your password and should be protected because if someone has acces to your private key, then they can access and transfer the bitcoins, those should always be kept secret

You should not be concerned with what happens with the bitcoins after you spend them, realize that most merchants have bills to pay and have to purchase new products, and it is most likely they can't yet do this with Bitcoin, Also realize that if they change the bitcoins into other currencies, there is someone else buying those bitcoins and that means they are being circulated to more and more people.

The economy does not die, and eventually might recover but in the mean time people loose their jobs, their houses companies go bankrupt because no one has money to buy things, and basically it is a huge step backwards, it happens often around the world in different countries with higher inflation than the us, but this is not something that has not happened in the US before, go look up the 1920's great depression and as you can see on this chart that goes hand in hand with those events.

deppends on where the price is when the trial is over, but it's all the same, if he agreed to sell them at a certain time then he agreed. I am also curious because I think those are not even his coins but the coins of the people that used the silk road if I understand. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:32:43
so does he get the cash from the sell if he is declared inocent ? because if that is the case and he agreed to auction them then I am fine with it, but if the money from the sell goes straight to the goverment or someone else, I would say he only agreed because he was preassured.

except that when you give banks your money they lend it out and charge people interest on the money you gave out to them, hmm also an ATM is a machine that saves banks the trouble of paying an employee to be sitting at a bank and having to process transaction, and also, most places that have an ATM get charged money for having it in there because it brings people in, and they have to pay the electric bill. It has been working well up till now, but now we hace Crypto, let that sink in.

there is an agreed price of gold by unit and it is an ounce of gold, just  as you can sell coffee by the pound, and perhaps in the future we will be using Milibits as a unit instead of Bitcoin as a unit, but all I am saying is one Bitcoin will not go under the price of an ounce of gold, I might be wrong, but i am confident that I am not.

I use and happily pay the fee of an ATM, all I am saying is that they have to be a bit scared that their service might not be needed or much less needed in the not so distant future. But I love ATM's anything that keeps me from standing in line to go to a bank I love. I hate banks, not the institutions but going to one and having to stand in long lines to pay someone or to get money from someone.

I think when it comes to Bitcoin there are people that are in it to make quick bucks and get out, they way this guy talks, he just thinks it is the future and sure he might sell some along the way to pay for stuff but, as i told my friend when he called me up and told me to sell at $600 I said no, he asked me why, I said, I wont sell my bitcoins, I will only pay in bitcoins when people take them, if it goes to 0 that is fine with me.  (i bought when the price was around $90)  also, I buy whatever I can with Bitcoins, i just buy whatever i spent back and hodl it, but I do use them any chance I have.

for me writting down the words and having them somewhere where someone can get to them seems a bit silly, I keep my wallets encrypted with strong randomly generated passwords etc etc I know I am not 100 % safe but to me it feels better than writing it down, I would have loved it if they had put it in as an optional feature and not a requirement on the multibit HD.
