I've fully synced an hour ago,and the bitcoins aren't at my wallet,and i dont know what to do,that key i posted,it aint at my "receive" adresses
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:10:13
the error i get is "wallet.dat corrupt,salvage failed"
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:04:20
the file is 88KB and i would assume like 3/10 is filled with 0
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:56:42
i went to localbitcoin,the place where i bought'em,and saw that i've sent to that address
