Off topic - can the Pebble screen display a bitcoin qr code? Namely, is it high enough resolution? (Apps are easy. Hardware is not)
EDIT - Yes. Thanks @_date: 2014-01-06 21:05:16
Okay, sold.

What, someone who knows how quantum computing works?

How would quantum computing challenge bitcoin?

The issue is not that. That is not the argument I'm making. I'm saying that the one output can be a tuple, such as (3, -3). It is not 3 or -3, it's both. sqrt(x) = (y,z): y = |x ^1/2 |, z = -| x^1/2 |.

Yeah, this isn't. But a function could be created with that behavior. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:51:32
Per [wikipedia]( functions can take n-tuples both as input and output.

What do you think this is? That's exactly what this is.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:47:59
Excellent. If that's just used for the signatures, it should be "easy*" to implement Lamport's algorithm and get around that. 
*easy, in this context, means that it doesn't break bitcoin, and that all old transactions should be able to remain secure.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:14:14
Yeah, I understand that it "breaks encryption." That only works for systems that depend on the difficulty of factoring and related problems - namely, the number theoretic cryptosystems like RSA and El Gamal. 
What I'm asking is
1) Does bitcoin depend on a number theoretic cryptosystem, and 
2) Does that system get used for more than the hashing, which isn't nearly as vulnerable to the quantum algorithms?

That's not changing the definition. It just maps RR to (RR,RR), where RR is the set of real numbers.
