Miners are individuals and groups of individuals who own the means of production of new BTC.  This process, in turn, controls the number of bitcoins in circulation.  New bitcoins are put into circulation at a decreasing rate.  But new people are entering into the Bitcoin economy at an increasing rate.  This leads to strange results in the price and perceived value of Bitcoin.

I think this was done for security/anonymity in the original client.

Even if you couldn't send that transaction through, couldn't you just send all of the btc in the wallet except for 1 satoshi, and just give the public and private key for the old address/wallet to the person who bought the satoshi?

This came up in discussion during the event, someone even mentioned Zuccotti.  I think it would be really funny to have an open air trading pit right outside the NYSE starting at 4pm as all the traders are leaving work for the day.  "What, you're leaving?! The fun is just beginning!"  In the end we may end up with a few different open air exchange meetings in different parts of the city.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:54:10
The last two meetings were very interesting.

I was thinking along similar lines recently, posted [this]( last night.  
There is great concern that governments may undermine or even destroy the bitcoin economy in some way. But should we be more concerned that government might embrace it for the worse, for example, to increase control over populations?
On the other hand, could the requirement of a block chain type transactional history enable better government oversight of targeted industries? 
And on the third hand, couldn't a blockchain type structure be used to control government itself?  For example, if it were instituted that all transactions in a given governmental department be recorded on it, therefore allowing for better audits, more accountability, etc?

There are a couple of examples of cases in the U.S. where juries have sided with defendants who argued that they were not lawfully required to pay certain taxes because the attornies for the state could not cite the law. [Aaron Russo]( was a fairly prominent activist who argued that no such law exists. Some people dismiss the argument as "conspiracy theory."

Start a Bitcoin Meetup group in your area.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:08:58
This is an important question, I think.  A lot of people are worried about what will happen if governments start legislating against Bitcoin etc.  I think we should be much more worried about the possibility that governments may aggressively adopt something like Bitcoin in order to micromanage their populations.
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:44:42
This was a fun event.  Will definitely go again.  Also, it was by far the simplest way to purchase bitcoin that I've come across.

And there are even more potential features that people haven't discovered or invented yet!  
With regard to the loss of money from BTC pools in the past, thanks for that tidbit, will have to check it out.  If they got robbed/hacked, then there was a fatal flaw in the construction of the pool, since a major point in having a  pool, imo, is to have higher levels of security!  
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:38:18
I guess that depends on your definition of a free market.
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:47:32
On the third hand, couldn't something like bitcoin be used to control or tightly monitor government spending itself?  In order to mitigate waste, fraud and abuse in government agencies?  All you would need is a public record of the private keys and who was controlling them.

I'm not talking about mining solo, I'm talking about mass decentralized mining in a browser.  I think I've seen one site that does this, but it seemed a bit sketchy.  
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:42:41
I've been asking myself similar questions.  Would be interested in more detail from others who are more informed than I.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:01:23
hmmmm, I guess everything! lol
Sometimes it just seems like when reading details about the mechanics of bitcoin related functions, for example, about blockchain.info, the explanation seems opaque in some way, and then after "getting it", it all seems to obvious and straightforward.  I guess I'm looking for more concrete detail about how the various processes involved work at specific sites or services.

Well, Jones has not endorsed it.  As I said, judging from this interview, he's skeptical, but also curious, and may be a good gauge for where some tea party types stand on the issue.

Deregulation means removing or reducing state regulations. Many argue that the deregulation of the [energy sector]( in California led to manipulations like that of Enron, and that [financial deregulation]( (in this case, removing barriers between commercial and investment banks, and insurance firms) contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

I think what may be missing from these sorts of discussions is the idea that Bitcoin could very well change our notions of what a bank is.  Today, people tend to think of banks as exploitative multinational institutions, and with good reason.  But the dictionary tells me that a bank is "an institution for receiving, lending, exchanging, and safeguarding money."  In the Bitcoin economy, anyone with a wallet and an address is thus, in a very loose sense, a bank.  We don't really know yet what kind of community bitcoin banking solutions people will come up with.  What are people doing already?  I'm not really sure.  Does anyone know of current experiments where people are pooling their BTC resources together, in order to have higher levels of security and potentially be able to draw upon more funds than any of them would have separately?
Local cash credit pools are fairly normal.  Ex. a group of twelve people get together and every week each of them puts in say $10 to the pool.  Each month over the course of the year, one person in the pool is awarded all of that month's money.  This is one way that people help one another in their daily lives.  It is basically a form of highly localized community banking.  Who knows what is possible in this regard with Bitcoin?

People were there until after 7pm.  The original plan was for it to go from 4-8pm.  There were only a handful of people still there at 7pm.

On decentralized mining . . . there are numerous instances of known trojans that sit in the browser and do mining work.  Why isn't this a legitimate plugin or piece of software yet?  That way anyone can help mine if they so desire?

Does this also happen with wallets such as Instawallet, blockchain.info, things like the Multibit client, or is this only the case for Bitcoin-Qt?

hmmm . . . maybe instead of giving it directly to the person who downloads, you could have some kind of thing where, when they download they can direct that small amount to some other worthy cause or something, even offer them a choice of where it should go.

As a musician, I've been thinking about similar things recently.  And as a person who's relatively new to bitcoin, I'm very excited to learn about bittracks and coindl.  My band has a new EP coming out in a few months, and I've been thinking about how to integrate BTC into our release of it in some way, both as a way to raise money to cover our costs, but also to expand the bitcoin economy.  I was thinking of adding a bitcoin donation button with each download, or maybe offering a paid download for bitcoin.  But I was also thinking in the other direction, to get some extra interest in our music: offering free btc WITH a download.  It would be similar to a faucet, except you also get MUSIC!

Good question.  A lot of tea party folks are likely skeptical of bitcoin because they are against a single world currency, arguing that it undermines national sovereignty.  However, some are also likely very curious.  Watch this video of Alex Jones (who is skeptical) interviewing Max Keiser (who is a big supporter).  Jones is a Tea Party supporter, who is arguably bit-curious.  The interview is from a few weeks ago.
