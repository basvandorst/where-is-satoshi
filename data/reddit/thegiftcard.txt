Maybe.. I've no clue at all..
I believe that bitcoin is better of without an ETF.. 
cryptocurrency should focus on the normal human in the street.. make sure that people can pay for it at every store at the corner.
Be independent and leave the 'old system' be.. dont follow it footsteps.

Yes. But lets continue your hypothesis;
What if this Major exchange is in Russia or China, or a private exchange funded by whales in the caymans.
The local govs can identify the manipulators, but the SEC cant. thats what they're saying: "we cannot identify.."
The SEC has not jurisdiction in those countries .. that's why we will not get a ETF, ever.

I doubt that a US entity has jurisdiction in Russia.. They cannot bring a russian manipulator to the russian court for manipulation. Right?
Yes. Exchanges like Wex, formarly known as btce, have such a good [sarcasme sign] relation with the US that they will think twice before complying.. they proof that the US gov can try to be the boss on the internet, but there other ways to go forward.

There is a difference between reality and the fabricated reality..  We all know that they charged him with a crime that is max 5 years for 2 reasons;
1; is probably the easiest to proof..
2; it gives them 5 more years to arrest him for the rest.
So what is the reality here? The simple truth of the max 5 years, or the more dificult truth where he would probably go away for the rest of his life?
Reality is a relative concept.. 9 out of 10 times there are different truths to a reality

No, it is not a crime for a journalist. Its the exact freedom of press that allows a journalist to receive those documents and write about them..
You know where those things are a crime? Dictatorships, and countries where you'll be arrested when you say that the glorious leader has an ugly nose..

Sure, thats why the US Gov wants him arrested for releasing the footage, because they are fake.. ��

Then you should move to a tax-free country, and live that life.
Otherwise you should comply with the local rules and regulations. 
Or face the consequences....

To my knowledge you should pay crypto tax where you pay your normal taxes.
There are rules and regulations for offshore savings accounts.
But I'm an European citizen, in a pro-crypto country. We already have does tax rules setup.
