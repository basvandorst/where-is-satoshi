I don't think I'm using Armory as a wallet, I believe that Armory just connects to Bitcoin Core in order to show what is in my Armory wallet. 
I did try and import the Armory wallet into another application called Electrum and I can now see my BTC there, however my Armory wallet still shows the same balance so I'm not sure if anything has actually happened or if I've just 'connected' to the same wallet

I'd appreciate any help with my issue below if possible. I've been searching online for the past few weeks but I'm a little in over my head.
Back in 2013 I bought a tiny amount of BTC 'just to have' and see where it goes. After doing some research at the time, I installed Armory and created a wallet there to keep my BTC.
I now have a new computer and would like to keep my wallet on this computer but I don't understand how to transfer it. I've installed and synchronized both my old computer (took forever) and my new computer so they are both up to speed through Bitcoin Core and Armory.
My research seems to indicate that I need to 'import' the wallet on my new computer but I tried that using the root keys on my old wallet and all it did was restore some random wallet ID that I don't recognize.
Is there something obvious I am missing? Is there a different software I should be using instead that is more user friendly to a casual owner such as myself?

Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately it would not let me send the BTC without a fee and I am hoping to find a way to do it 'free'.
It seems that is not as easy as I thought it would be however!
