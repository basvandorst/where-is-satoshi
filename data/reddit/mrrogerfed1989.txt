The way I see it playing out is something like this:
- Whales buy up as many Bitcoins as possible
- The public FOMO buys in
- Futures market opens
- Tons of people short Bitcoin futures
- Same people go and make multi-million dollar market sells on exchanges using the coins they just acquired
- New investors panic sell and drive the price even lower
- Stop losses trigger which drive the price even lower
- Rinse and repeat
Time to warn people, we all must **HODL**

JPM will make money if the price moves up OR down. Meaning they can make money even if Bitcoin's price is range bound, whereas us Hodlers only make money when the price goes up and thus do no benefit from sideways movement.

The bankers will gain control of Bitcoin just like they have done with all commodities that have a futures market, e.g. precious metals, Oil, Iron Ore

Quotes of concern:
- "will make it much easier to bet on a decline"
- "The futures reduce the frictions of going short more than they do of going long" - **what's wrong with going long?**
- "keep the bitcoin price a little closer to reality" - **uhhh the reality was UP before they have decided otherwise?**
- 'Jamie Dimon famously called the cryptocurrency "a fraud" ' - **so the CB's/Institutions DON'T LIKE Bitcoin**
- 'The ability to short the currency is "an important part of the ecosystem", said Novogratz' - **only if they don't like the price going up?**
- "The concept is that this is such a volatile market that it's going to scare a lot of investors away" - **they're creating this volatility by promoting shorting, not the other way around**

With the gold/silver 'physical' bullion and gold/silver 'paper' futures markets, the bankers  comprise both the buyer AND seller end of the market. And they coordinate and collude both sides of the trade in tandem.
That way they can coordinate movements in price and sentiment - they have gained full control of the precious metals markets this way.
I don't see why they'd be playing dirty in the gold market, yet not plan the same thing with BTC.

Be cautious and alert guys, these banks literally win the game by being better than everyone else at it. They're not your friends, they're at the top because they are cunning and their mandate is to fuck everyone for profit.
It wasn't long ago Jamie Dimon was anti-bitcoin. He has most likely changed tact following from this 'aha' moment with futures - taking advantage of the arbitrage to manipulate sentiment both ways and profiting from/fleecing the suckers.
This may be their way to manipulate (thus control) Bitcoin.

This needs to be raised more. Not enough people are awares.

They've been manipulating the Gold price for decades now:
Who are they kidding here with this shit?

Day traders are meaningless because they're small-money. It's the whales that matter, the instiutional money who have billions and billions, even trillions if necessary $
Just got this link from somebody, looks like they're going to attempt what i've just stated:
My bet is that their long game will be to play the swings in price, and slowly corner the Bitcoin market while keeping the price down. They will knock the price down, buy up just a little more to hold, rinse and repeat.

Or they could manipulate the crap out of Bitcoin like they have with Precious metals and Oil futures.

Doesn't sound particularly healthy or positive for BTC, no?

OP must deliver. Bitcoin requests it, $10k is here, a deal is a deal
