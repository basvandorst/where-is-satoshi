I mean the intro prices for everything is 5$... But everyone has their addons and usually a job turns into 40 or 50 bucks... Which is fine and still extremely reasonable...
End of the process you can just choose pay with btc for whatever $$ amount is in your cart.

Haven't done it yet, but I was stoked to see fiverr.com accepts bitcoin... I higher session musicians and vocalists for the tracks I produce on there...
And if you don't know about the site it's a great place to find people who can pretty much do anything for you. It's wicked.

There was a 128 btc buy order on Gdax right before it passed through 12k. Some crazy volume going down. 
Edit 128 BTC in 1 order. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:12:01
This is amazing to see, well done.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:08:14
All we need now is about 85 dolphins to buy 10 btc each and we can move on. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:25
This vid would be better if you could see the buy and sell orders, and the list or trades on the right side when you go full screen. 
Biggups tho.

For a finance hotshot I liked what he had to say. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:36:38
But that's pretty much what they all say over at r/btc about all the core team...
This whole battle is really confusing and annoying. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:46:21
I loved that scene.
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:22:07
I've been holding off the blue in the lower right corner under the big B. Could use some help.

Thanks man! Steady Hodling the orange.

Your flag is twice as high as it needs to be. Way over double the proportion of a flags size.

Allright, I've been dropping blocks for close to 12 hours now. I hope you guys can hold it overnight. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:37:33
Cool, well, I'll just keep oranging out that blue till I go to bed in about 7 hours. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:27:32
No. We get the full orange square. You guys can put the blue of your flag behind it. I have nothing to do today and will continue to delete blue blocks. 
I went to Paris, nice place....^For^me^to^poop^on. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:16:04
I've been deleting your blue blocks in that area for about 5 hours now. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 05:05:45
IT's fine how it is... This might end at midnight... 
There is a lot of little shit spots... I've been dropping blocks for 8 or 9 hours now. Hodl. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:39:30

We need to focus on getting rid of all the blue in the orange square from the French. Only Megaman and the rainbow can stay in our territory. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:02:58
Looks like maybe people are trying to just have the one bitcoin logo and keep all the rest orange with the black outline... That will actually be easier to maintain.

@_date: 2017-04-02 03:01:54
Im trying to clean up any black in the orange up there... and we trying to make the second logo? It seems like some are trying to expand a lot of black and others are going for Orange...
Top corner chaos!
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:35:01
Shit I got distracted and didn't notice that his foot got messed up and I put an orange block there. Will go back to cleaning up the top left corner. 
Lots of attacks on the Bitcoin name at the bottom but I'm letting the dudes running the scripts hold that... I hope at the end of this we can see how many blocks we put. I must be close to 30 now I bet.

Is there an online school or resource where he can learn all the kinds of coding needed to work on bitcoin projects?

"It went from 12 to 60 dollars. That's why I love it, that's why I believe in it, that's why I tell all my friends about it. If you want to make money invest in Ethereum"
I mean I'm not hating on the girl because she's stoked, but I hope she invests more of her time to research fundamentals and not base her endorsement on price rise, because, we all know what happens on the roller coaster.

I'd love to hear an explanation from someone knowledgeable about how this could affect the price of exchanges?
A BTC derivative would be traded on the stock market correct? How is it tied to the price? And vice versa? Ie. if there were massive shorts like what we see on the comex, it's not like the exchanges are obligated to follow the derivative prices, up or down?
Seems confusing and I'd love to hear some input from someone who is experienced in this space.
