A lot is a lot when you feel no longer comfortable in losing all the money that you have involved in bitcoin... For some people that's 0.1 BTC, for others +100 BTC... That's all personal, depending on your total bank account.

Hehe, I know you're going to laugh, but I trade with Bitstamp (yeah I know, the fees... :)) But my analysys is mostly based on paterns which I just started to learn by reading op r/bitcoinmarkets and also I follow Chris Dunn on Twitter:  He sometimes tweets some very interesting market moves on Twitter and they mostly pan out nice. I dont follow him on everything and make my own interpretation of what he sais, but baiscly I look at a lot of graphs here on reddit from people I know are good at trading, consider them wether they're plausible or not and make a move. But the last months my only move was hodl so I'm glad that my first move in months was so succesfull... I know it's no much, but it was a good trade for me, gaining 0.13 btc in only a day's work... (work = checking btc all the time during my work (have it open in a different tab and setting my buys/sells accordingly in real time on Bitstam)... I am not the big shot daytrader everyone claims here to be... I just try to understand and try to stay logic. :)

Thanks for your reply. To install a full working web shop I think will be to much hassle for just this small market test...so I'm looking for something that can easily be created.I was thinking maybe placing a qr code on the page, and once a certain small amount of Bitcoin has been deposited by the community,a new batch of content will be released for everyone...but I'm not sure that it's a good idea...
@_date: 2014-01-19 12:59:05
So I made this wallpaper since I couldn't find any decent one...
Other idea's are welcome, I will make 'm for you.

There are already a lot of things that are forming up that would be great to see put into everyday use:
- Shopping: install a panel on every shopping cart so that you can scan your products yourself. When you're done shopping, simply press 'pay' and you recieve an on-screen QR-code. Pay with bitcoin and just walk out the store, without having to go past any kind of register. Greatly reducing the time we shop. Negative: job loss (but I believe a lot of new bitcoin inovations will result in some sort of job loss. But maybe the people working the registers could help people shopping, explain bitcoin and give advice...)
- Begging/Charity 2.0: We already see a lot of great ways Bitcoin is involved in charity. Think about Sean’s Outpost. No middle-man with sticky fingers. Or even baggers could use bitcoin, drasticly reducing the risk of getting their much needed cash stolen.
- Music/Entertainment industry: The idea of having the pirate bay use bitcoin would drasticly improve the way artists earn money. No need for a greedy iTunes of any sort and getting all the reward from their hard work straight from the consumer/fan.
- Prostitution/Striptease: more a gimmick then a real surplus: having QR-codes tattood on a certain body part. Just for fun. OR in case of a stripclub, a large screen with a certain amount of btc/dollar on it that has to be deposited by the customers in order for the striper to take out another part of her clothing. I know, maybe a bit silly, but hey, oportunity none the less...
I really need to get some out-of-the-box thinking going on here. I meself rather suck at it at this moment, so any type of inspiration would be greatly appreciated!

Hi, is it possible to withdraw them to another Bitcoin adres?  You could open a (free) account on Bitstamp and send them to your Bitstamp.net public key. Then you can withdraw them with a wired transfer...
"International withdrawals will be charged with 0.09% fee, minimum fee is $15.00 on Bitstamps end and may incur additional international bank fees. Minimum amount for international withdrawal is $50.00."
Or you could give me your bitcoins and I'll be thankfull :) 1EJ6KTu8uaSuSo1soJSiyjzcat1Vsw1jvT

This can't be right... Are people actually getting payed?
This doesn't feel right
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:37:06
Well, I follow your point completely. I given the title a lot of thought. Also the questionmark was added as to not make it a statement. Since we are dealing with a magazine, I'm fairly sure most of our readers (who pay more than 5 euro's for one magazine) will not just stick to the title. The article itself has a lot of sub-titles as well who are no 'read bait' sort of speak. But I understand your point of view...
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:52:32
So, earlier I asked some input from you guys for an article about Bitcoin. This week, the monthly edition of Ché (Belgian magazine) will publish and contain six(!) pages about Bitcoin. I tried to keep it light but as correct as possible. Explained what bitcoin is, how it works and what some cool applications for the future (and men in particulary, men-orientated magazine) could be. I'm happy :)
EDIT: It even made the frontpage! Bitcoin: betalen zonder spoor translates to Bitcoin: paying without a trace?

Price: &lt;4 euro's payed with BTC off course :)
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:48:56
Good idea! Thanks! Will keep that one in mind.
The problem then is, how do I deliver the high-res images to the customers who have paid? 
Maybe let them fill in a webform, ask them with what bitcoin-adres they will pay and send them the download link as soon as they have paid? Although kind of laybour intensive ;)
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:30:00

Mildly the same here. Invested one full paycheck atm, recieved a new one today and will see how much is left of this one at the end of the month and deposit the remaining on bitstamp ;)
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:39:09
And besides, bitcoin does leave a trace, but to where, that's a mather of personal security and anonimity. That's a point I try to make in my article. The whole blockchain shows every transaction, that is true. But if you play your cards right it will never be tracable to you personally.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:12:53
No. I'm sorry...
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:33:29
Anyone any idea on the title of the article? Let's make this a community effort ;) And for those who think I'm just lazy, (well, I am about some things :)) I want this to be something that does not only support my own vision (which may be biased)
By the way, the article is (luckely for me and my readers) NOT in English... I will be glad to translate afterwards for anyone who's interested...
Title suggestions I had:
- How Bitcoin will change our lives
- Bitcoin: the biggest 'fuck you' you can give (yeah, went total anarchy on this one ;))
- Bitcoin: X reasons why it has to work (too easy title)
- Are we ready for a revolution?
- Let's 2.0 our lives

I work as a Freelancer and ask as many of my contracts to pay me in Bitcoin. Some are starting to consider it... So maybe, one day... Just keep asking!
And also, being a DJ in my spare time, I always have my laptop with me and people can easily transfer me bitcoins to pay me using Bitplaats.be, a dutch website. They can just use their card as they are used to with online banking. Bitcoins are at my adres in less then 15 minutes, it's an awesome way to acquire some bitcoins...

I completely agree on what you are saying, but I think there may be some confusion about how it went.
I know exactly what panic buying/selling is because I made those mistakes in the past (a year ago). It's a hard way to learn not to do it but it's the only way...
This time was different. The +-586 range was having some nice support but it could not last, purely based on the information I had at the time, so I decided to sell an hour before the market made the move downwards. Even when the price jumped a few moments, I never felt the need to 'cut my losses'. I was confident (again, because all the signs where there) that the price would drop to somewhere around 550-560 range as ultimate bottom.
But instead of setting my bottom even further, which I could and maybe should have done, but no regrets, but I estimated that 568 was fairly a failsafe rebuy-price. If I was truely pani-buying and selling I would have made a lot of bad desicions on the way down from 586 to 568 but I did not. The fact that the price now is still dropping makes complete sense to me and I do not regret re-shorting again because right now I do not have the time to re-estimate a good buy/sell... I made this very cool graph to show at what point I bought and at what price I put my rebuy. Rebbuy was set the moment the sell was placed, so that's roughly 11 hours before the actual buy-order went through. I followed the price, but even the jumps back up did not move me in the slightest way and I'm glad for that... No emotions except that of joy at the end of the buy/sell were ever in place during these 11 hours...
OW yeah, the cool graph:

I do not believe 2015 will be the year Bitcoin 'goes mainstream'. Yes it will be talked about, more people will use, hodl or trade it and more merchants will accept it. But we are far, far away from big scale adoption... Honestly, I do not think any 'common folk' will actually use this for at least another 3 years. Let's talk again in 2018-2020. If Bitcoin still excists (and I hope so, since I'm a longtime hodler AND believer) by then, it will be widely accepted and price will have risen also. But not after some heavy volatility, insane crashes (heck, 100/btc is possible imo) and exhuberant rises (&gt;ATH-levels). But for 2015, I predict more or less the same path we 've started in 2014. Up, down, left, right, adoption, repeat.
TLDR: 2015 will not be thé year for BTC.

Like everyone here I am NO EXPERT! I have no economical knowledge what so ever. But with some common sence you should try to come to an agreement with yourself as what to expect, what you are willing to give (and possibly lose OR win (also set a 'buy-out' goal and STICK to it, even if the market is booming. Better out quick then staying too late)...

I see your hackers and raise it with BANKROBBERS
Sure some people will steal... But the big majority won't and won't even notice anything...

I tought he was going there with his story but no... The convenience of online shopping without it's main USP, combined with the irritating task to actually go some place... I think he's on to something!
Sorry OP, like the idea though...

What I've learned so far... 
I have made 2 deposits (both around 200 dollars) and the thing I regretted the most was to turn those dollars into BTC as soon as they reached my Bitstamp account... I know this might be hard (at least it was for me) but WAIT a bit... Look at the market a few DAYS!
That's all I can say.
And always ask yourself the question: "How likely is it that this is the best price I will get the BTC for in the coming few days..."

Return to normal is where we are... mean not even in sight... probably somewhere mid-next week when we've had a new crash.

Well, I myself am looking forward to see how all this develops... But I think, when you look at the current value of the bitcoin, bitcoin is here to stay for a long time. I sure hope so... But when you see the intrest it gets slowly but shurely by your average Tom... I think great months and years are ahead of us, the early birds... 
It's not up to the bitcoin-system to make derivitives. Pioneers will open shops, make ATM's... People with a vision and a lot of guts will bring this to the streets and into the homes. Few at first, a lot in, lets say, 10 years from now?
The flaw with those other 'new' alternatives is, that they don 't hold any value at the moment and have to fight for their right at the party... A fight which, if you ask me (and you did :)), is like David VS Golliath (bitcoin being the golliath). Please ignore the fact that David won that battle! I'm just trying to make a point...
We'll see... Interesting times none the less!

I've been looking for that 'right time to buy' for a long time... And it's always in retrospective that I say 'Damn, that was the right time to buy'... So I just said 'f*ck it, let's buy'... I'm coinvinced that the prise will rise spectacadoublarously in the next X months...

Chris, you are helping a lot! I used to be very emotional when it came to trading, now I can say I am much more confident about my buys and sells. I see a bigger picture now thanks to you!
Last 2 days have been nothing but good buys and sells. I think, I hope, I'm getting the hang of it.
Now, I know daytrading is not very popular around here and we should HOLD no matter what, but the truth is, I am only trading with 1/5th of all my coins. Just trying to squize some more out of that 1 fifth. I believe in bitcoin in the long run, unlike others and I have a great bit of fun trying to understand how it all works and learning about it every day and I HOPE everyone else experience it the same way.
Don't get jelly on people who are doing a great job on what they do best: trading. Being jelly is not okay m'kay? :)
And cheer up! If you need a suicide line, I advise you to stop trading bitcoins and go outside. Life IS beautifull!

So nice that the price keeps rising! And at a, sort of, 'steady graph'... :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:55:06
I'm European and I don 't sell... Since I bought them at 96 :p
Don 't be afraid of this new low... It will rise again to great hights and will drop back to insane lows... That's how it goes!
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:07:13
Wow! All the best in the world to you and your brother and I hope you'll succeed at achieving your dream!!!

A real breakthrough will be when the first companies pay salaries in bitcoin... I foresee this to happen! First a few innovative companies who like media-attention. Then the big internationals who transfer money all the time...
