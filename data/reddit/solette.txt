If I'm reading you correctly here, your use of "current system" in this sentence refers to the current banking system, correct?
If so I would very much like to begin moving away from it, even if it's just a little bit. On top of the run of mill worldwide issues caused by banks irresponsible actions, I also have a few personal horror stories that give me increased motivation to move away from their control.

The "Getting Started" section in the sidebar at /bitcoin leads me to a page where I can browse wallets. these wallets have bullet points listing some of their main features, good or bad.
Looking at the Blockchain.info wallet under Desktop is a good example of something I consider odd given what I understood crypto currencys goals to be. My impression is that this wallet in particular seems to do a lot of unnecessary things that don't seem to have a benefit to the user.
As far as usability and the amount I'm storing, it will likely be small potatoes, I'm not very wealthy. I want to store most of the Bitcoin I end up with in a paper wallet, and keep a tiny amount available just for kicks.

Thanks for the message, that bitlisten is very cool,  I saw a 333 Bitcoin bubble floating by seconds after opening it!
I looked at the wallets mentioned on this subreddits "getting started" section and Electrum seemed to be the closest match to what I'm looking for, I'll start there.
Thank you for the info, and thanks for the red pill!

I'm kind of a shut in, but I appreciate your response!

Thank you for your response. I will look into them further, at first glance their website seems to be quite vague about the specifics of how they do what they do.

Thank you for your response.
My main concern is what my wallet does with my private key. If my understanding of wallets is correct, the private key is the only way to move bitcoin out of my wallet. It seems like there are some wallets that store your private key somewhere, somehow on their end also, which I want to completely avoid.
Of course, it's quite possible that I'm just completely wrong about this, I've still got a lot of learning to do!

Very kind of you friend.

Thank you for your response.
I'm happy to pay a small fee for the service of turning dollars into BTC, it's only fair. 
As for the wallet being able to set a fee, does this mean I can end up charging myself a fee even if none was required?

Yes, this is the exact moment that is currently holding me at pause. I'm having difficulty discerning how to trust an exchange.
Thank you for the reply, I will look into AML and KYC regulated exchanges.
