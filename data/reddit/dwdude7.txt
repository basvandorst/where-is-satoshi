No sign-ups for international? No wonder every other non-US based exchange bans US from trading 90% of the time. That not how decentrilized should fucking work.

You honestly think bitcoin has "value" ? Just as shit coin as this whole crypto trash. Be honest with yourself. All holding and "hoping" their shitcoin will moon. Those who are really rich will control "supply and demand" ratio. They can do 500% pumps in 24h, then can make bitcoin go 20k+ in matter of days, but they won't because they are here for a long term and  careful game. Also, most of "percentage" statistic made up on spot. You don't know shit. What makes bitcoin good is that its main trading pair. Thats it. Other "values" are bullshit. I am holding a lot of different crypto including bitcoin, and will never understand that fanatism towards particular crypto.

Just like visiting reddit or any other website on the internet. Watching shit random people posted. That's how it sounds. Same to stocktrader saying investing in bitcoin is idiotic.

I don't disagree with you. My point was that some people praising their particular crypto like religious fanatics.
