Thank you. Exactly what i am looking for.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:43:23
So your whole problem is basically because a bank would transfer the funds for you? How is this bitcoins fault?
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:12:42
Difficulty adjustment is taken over a 2016 blocks (2 weeks). Not the most recent.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:03:35
No, their fee is very high, which helps. Mine got confirmed in 3 blocks (Requried 3 confirmation).
Edit. Only saw "Internally" now.

Back up it seems. Just their Shitty servers again
Edit. Nope still down
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:57:44
Difficulty is going down not up. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:37:38
Just refresh a couple times. Everyone has been having the same problem.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:56:25
Ho do you specify small fees on Electrum? The slider still recommends higher than needed fees, even all the way down

Thats amazing. Should be advertised a lot better though! I mean its the equivalent of Amazon accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:42:53
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:23:24
But surely, thats the inherent risk of investing i  anything... 
Therefore its pretty pointless advice and just creates FUD

Everything points to it bouncing back. Past history, fundamental tech hasn't changed etc. Every stock could crash and not come back up, does that mean we shouldnt buy anything?

Can you provide before and afters?
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:17:26
If you ordered at a lower price than what its being sold at, your order wont be fulfilled. This is especially The case when the price is constantly rising like it has been over the past couple hours. If you want to immediately buy, click on a coin thats being sold at a specific price. You may pay extra fees for this as you are now a "taker" (Taking away liquidity from the market)
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:10:23
I really couldnt care less about you trusting me

How did you pay for takealot?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:47:48
In general yes. Im sure there are exceptions.
Edit. Just checked and ripple is down 15% over a month?
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:22:25
This cant be true. You have a screenshot?

BCH Selloff continuing slowly maybe?

Ill be making use of this

Bitfinex walls are the craziest to watch. Saw a 1000+ btc wall fall in one trade once
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:12:35
what other good websites like bitcoinwisdom exist for graphing?
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:14:42
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:34:40
Im just happy BCH/BTC is now under where i sold mine at a month or so ago
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:26:40
Yip, breakthrough is what we are looking for haha

also learnt this. dumped in time too
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:34:24
I dumped my alts about 3 weeks ago. Alts haven't moved and Bitcoin has pumped. I'm definitely better off than people that have held there alts and I can buy back into them at pretty much the same levels. Don't comment on people's trading if you don't know anything 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:33:45
Problem (or not) is, it becomes a huge part of you portfolio very quickly
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:39:11
Read a little.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:40:14
This guy definitely sold or shorted a while back.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:38:33
Can you provide a link?
