Gemini is the best

Wouldn't Qubes be hard to run from a live usb since it is running pretty much 3 OSes at the same time?
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:51:37
No it's fine, I just wanted to know if there was something else everyone liked to use. Having some OS diversity would be nice.
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:46:07
That's what I have installed on a few of my drives.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:55
And electrum will support it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:36
And electrum will support it?
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:15:15
No I mean like if you transfer USD in, can you buy bitcoin and then send out the bitcoin to something else before the real transaction actually happens too?
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:26:22
Sure thing
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:49:53
Oh ok, interesting. How much are the transfers usually? Like are the all $100+?
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:57:35
Ok, have you been able to make bank transfers yet? Like has the money landed in your Gemini account? Or have you not tried/is it still pending?
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:56:36
That's pretty good. Have you had experience with support? How long do they take to respond?
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:47:21
it does sound a little sketchy... meeting someone to exchange bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:14:48
They just responded to mine 
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:15:22
Understandable 
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:11:23
Oh that's nice. I sent them something ealier today but no response :/
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:20:29
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:15:51
What is the reason they are giving you that you can't transfer out?
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:54:33
How long did that response from Gemini take?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:16:33
They have responded within a day for me. Haven't gotten verified yet but their support seems fast.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:11:44
Oh really? So can you move the BTC over to an exchange, or using changelly or shapeshift to make it something else immediately?
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:54:29
Oh ok
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:16:19
Coinbase with a credit card or bank account?
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:11:31
Jesus that sucks
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:17:39
Well I guess if it is in there there is no reason you should be able to trade it. They money is going to make it there anyways I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:02:53
Hoping gemini verifies me soon! I'll also try kraken verification too.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:07:57
Dang. Have you tried buying using a bank transfer?
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:21:49
That's not instant, that is the one week bank transfer. The credit card fees are 5%
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:43:49
Question: If I want to buy bitcoin to invest in altcoins, does it matter when I buy (from coinbase)? Or should I wait for a dip for any reason?
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:27:16
Ok thanks
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:09:15
Nice. How long did it take to land in your account once you confirmed it?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:34:50
Nope. I asked them to update my name, and the person responded that they updated it and to not hesitate to ask any more questions.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:54:15
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:54:22
That is what I am hoping for exactly
