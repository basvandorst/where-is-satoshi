The Raspberry Pi doesn't have enough memory to efficiently process the database that holds the blockchain, so you'll never sync up to the network. Even if you pre-load it with a blockchain it still won't be able to keep up.

We're hosted on Reddit so the gold supports Reddit's infrastructure. Plus there are ways to tip in Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:54:03
No but if it were possible that would be the end of Bitcoin.

They're your coins until you hand the paper wallet to them. For all you know they would've burned it out of spite and the coins would've been lost. I say enjoy spending that money. If you tell them then you'll be just like them, i.e., just doing it to hurt them.

With bitquick.co, the company holds the coin in escrow until you demonstrate you deposited cash into the seller's bank account. I've done this about 10 times with no issues. With localbitcoin, you can do it in-person or you can send (to a reputable seller) money by various means including bank deposit, or moneygram-type services. You get your coin when the seller confirms receipt of the money. I've done that twice so far again with no issues.

I would buy more at $500 regardless of what my basis is. If I liked it at $1000 I would like it twice as much at $500.

You're not the type I'm looking for then
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:49:36
If you use cash, you can buy right away using bitquick.co or localbitcoins.

Both factors you refer to are likely to add to demand. Also, China keeps buying.

There's a rumor of a pending yuan devaluation. Those in the know may be buying BTC as a hedge.

Come back when you've included transaction fees in your "analysis"
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:13:05
OP's argument is a non-sequitur precisely because he hasn't accounted for transaction fees:


The price of Bitcoin is not exclusively dictated by the amount of coin being mined.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:45:35
The night side would be fine, so Bitcoin will live on in the nodes of the night.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:32:29
How do they know? My coin are at different addresses so **IF** I have more than 10 you can't tell. Is this really just "This is the amount of bitcoin at each address in the blockchain"?

Maybe he wants 21 houses, or one in California

Actually can you please do some buying so I can get a better price for my purchases k thx

Try "Bitcoin rape" too
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:02:41
You most likely won't be stiffed if you deal with someone who has a lot of positive reviews. Each of those positive reviews represents someone who got their bitcoin from this seller. There may be more to the escrow system than that but the bottom line is that positive reviews equals trust on localbitcoins.

Are you sure she's really there, or did someone hijack her email account and sent messages out to everyone she knows asking for "urgent assistance"
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:56:26
I don't know if you've heard this, but if you include transactions in your blocks then you get to pocket the fees associated with those transactions.

There's no such market yet. Around here we just like to hodl.

They've been covering it heavily, it's been a pleasure to read.
Adding value here: WSJ is behind a paywall but one way around it is to Google the name of the article, then click the "news" tab (if necessary--so Google returns only articles). Clicking the link Google gives you should bypass the paywall.
So, for example, for this article, Google the phrase "Bitcoin Trades Full Speed Ahead" and you should be able to click through and read it.
Edit: For whatever reason, the headline on this article online is different: "Bitcoin Drives to a New High, but Is It Headed for a Crash?"
