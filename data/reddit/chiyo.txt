You won't save as much dollar cost averaging as you would if you bought once at the bottom, but have you ever tried buying in at the bottom? Trying to time the market is tricky and even if you think you're buying in at the bottom, it could be a fake out. Dollar cost averaging allows you to minimize risk by putting less money at stake at any one time. If the price is down, buy a little. If it goes down further, buy a little more. Then when it goes back up, you've made a profit off both buys, but if it continues going down, you haven't lost much, yet you have an opportunity to buy even more.

It's called dollar cost averaging. Buy some at 20% and then buy more at 50%. In the end as long as it goes up it doesn't really matter.

Care to elaborate on what I said that's false? I don't claim to be an expert but I have done a good bit of research on the subject so if I'm wrong, I would like to know what exactly it is that I'm wrong about. So, you claim that computer speed is the current problem that's preventing on-chain scaling from working. How is that so? Does computer speed contribute to full blocks, high fees, and long confirmation times? Does it prevent block size increases? What exactly am I missing here? I would love to know.

If you want to sell the dip, I think the best thing to do is wait for it to start happening. It will be obvious when the price suddenly falls off the cliff. I know we've had some mini corrections so I would wait until it drops further than those before selling.

I also recently sent from a SegWit address (Trezor) to a non-SegWit paper wallet. I didn't even use economy mode. I used a low fee (101 sat/byte) and I still got charged around $3 for a 0.002 BTC transaction ($26 at the time). That was on the morning of the 24th and it's still unconfirmed. The estimated confirmation time was four days. I don't know how people are getting low fees transactions to go through with SegWit but it's not working for me.

Do you know if Bech32 addresses are backwards compatible with existing Bitcoin clients or do they only work with new software? For example, if I send from a bc1 address to a 1 or 3 address, will it work, or what about from 1 or 3 to bc1? From my understanding, it has to be from bc1 to bc1 only.

The problem with on-chain scaling is not just computer speed, it's mainly storage capacity. The reason Bitcoin fees are so high is because there's so much volume that all the transactions are using up all the space in each block. When that happens, higher fee transactions take priority and lower fee transactions have to wait their turn, hence the complaints of high fees and long confirmation times. On-chain scaling solves this problem temporarily but it cannot and will not work forever. The on-chain solution is to simply increase the block size, allowing more transactions to fit, temporarily lowering fees and confirmation times. However, as volume increases, so will the number of transactions and the blocks will get full again. This means more block size increases. The problem is that as the block size increases, so does the overall size of the blockchain as a whole. As the blockchain gets larger, it will become more expensive and difficult for people to store it and run full nodes. As a result, it's not only unsustainable for exponential growth, especially for visa or paypal levels, but it will cause the network to become more and more centralized as the only way to run a full node will be in a datacenter.

It's no longer profitable to mine Bitcoin with CPUs or GPUs. The difficulty is so high that the only way to profitably mine is with ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) hardware. However, there are other coins with algorithms that still work well with CPUs and GPUs. Monero, for example, uses an algorithm called Cryptonight which you can profitably mine with a CPU. If you're using a typical gaming PC you may not make more than two or three dollars a day (mining with both CPU and GPU), but as long as it pays out more than the cost of electricity, it's still a profit.

I did some 101 sat/byte transactions two days ago. The estimated confirmation time was four days which is the day after tomorrow. Do you think it's likely that they'll be confirmed by then? I'm worried that the fees will go back up by then and they'll never get confirmed. I just couldn't justify paying any more than that for the small amount I was sending.

The expiration date is a great idea. I gave every household in my family a paper wallet for Christmas and they were all clueless as to how it works. I tried to explain as simply as possible but it didn't really work. In the end, I told them to just hold on to them for a few years and hopefully they'll go up in value. If they want to cash out, they can either follow the instructions on the back or tell me and I'll do it for them. I also kept backups just in case because as clueless as my family is, I wouldn't be surprised if at least one or two of them loses their wallets or even throws them away. I also didn't give them much for the same reason. If any of them show genuine interest and manage to hold on to their wallet, I may add more to it. My dad is one of those exceptions. He's given me $20 to add to it on two separate occasions and now his $40 is worth over $140. When I told him that, he had me show him how to sign up on an exchange so he can add to it himself.

Using Bitcoin like cash is not the issue. Settling all of the transactions on the blockchain is the problem. The blockchain itself is not suitable for processing millions of transactions per second. For that, we will need off-chain scaling. Solutions like Lightning Network that adds up all the small transactions off-chain and then groups them into one large transaction on the blockchain. The reason we still want to use the blockchain, even as inefficient as it is, is because it's incredibly useful as an immutable ledger for large transactions. It will basically be the backbone of the network if off-chain scaling works as intended.

If these "types of transactions" are against their policy, I would ask them to elaborate on exactly what policy they go against. It's very strange that this is coming from loss prevention because at the business I work for, loss prevention has to do with theft and loss of assets. What do bank transfers have to do with loss of funds? Coinbase is just another financial institution and they're not stealing your funds. Unless they have a policy against certain types of exchanges or crypto currency trading, I think you have grounds to contest this. If they won't back down, I would absolutely change banks. You could also consider switching to Gemini (which I would recommend anyway) but they would probably treat it the same way.

Using a Bitcoin debit card or buying a gift card with BTC is pretty much the only option for paying most merchants right now. You can tell them about Bitcoin all you want, but if you want to buy something, you'll most likely have to use fiat. So until Bitcoin is accepted everywhere, Bitcoin debit cards and gift cards that you can load with BTC are necessary as a temporary solution to bridge the gap between BTC and fiat. As for not using the Bitcoin blockchain, how do you think they transfer their funds to the exchange to load the card? They make a transaction on the blockchain from their wallet to the exchange. At least they're not spamming up the blockchain with all of their coffee purchases. Actually, the service they're using reminds me of Lightning Network in the fact that they're making one large transaction on the blockchain and then all of their small purchases occur off the blockchain, freeing it up for others.
  
Anyway, I also have a Bitcoin debit card, though currently I'm in the same situation that OP was in with Cryptopay. I have to load the card with Bitcoin and every time I load it, the fees are astronomical. I may look into TenX as well unless someone knows of a better solution for US residents.

The reason it's considered a scam is because the coins or paper wallets have a private key inscribed on them which is used to redeem the funds. The seller has access to the private key when it is in their possession which means they could easily make a copy and wipe the balance from the wallet after selling it. This is why you should never buy any kind of wallet unless it's a blank template with some way to inscribe your own keys. It's basically the same as someone selling you access to a bank account where you both have access to the funds. Now, as far as I understand, when Casacius Coins were created, the original copies of the private keys were destroyed and the keys on the coins were hidden. I've never heard of funds being stolen from them either, but that still doesn't make them safe. The person who created them had access to the private keys at some point so buy owning them, you're putting trust in that person. The best thing to do if you absolutely must have one of these coins is to wipe the balance to a separate wallet as soon as possible and keep the coin as a collectible only.

If you have the BitPay debit card, they only allow you to use the "normal" miner fee as apposed to "economy" or "super economy" when loading the card. They also charge their own "Network fee" on top of that, so it makes it prohibitively expensive even when the mempool is low. Coinbase, on the other hand, charges no fees at all for their Shift Card and you don't even have to worry about loading it because it withdraws straight from your BTC wallet.

How do you know that the creator didn't make a copy of the private key when they inscribed it on the coin, though? I don't profess to know exactly how they're made, but I just don't see how you can trust that they obscured it from themselves when they created it. Maybe they're more valuable with the funds (and hologram) intact, but I still think it's incredibly risky for a buyer because you have to place trust in the creator of the coin. That said, I'm not claiming that the people who created the coins are scammers. In fact, as I said, I've never heard of funds being stolen from a coin. I'm just saying that someone had to inscribe the private key which means that someone other than the buyer was in possession of it at some point before the hologram was applied, which is a potential security risk. I'm sure it's not in the creator or seller's best interests to scam anyone because then that would ruin their reputation, but it's entirely possible nonetheless.

That's true but for a user of the service, even if they pointed their miner to an external wallet, it would mine to a Nicehash wallet until it reached a certain point where it would payout. I'm not sure but I think other mining pools work the same way. You mine to the pool, you reach a threshold, and then they payout. If you were making a lot, you could potentially get paid everyday, but smaller miners such as myself had to wait weeks or months. Fortunately for those who cashed out as soon as possible, they didn't loose much. The ones who lost the most are the ones who didn't heed your advice and kept their funds in Nicehash. For me, personally, I lost about $100 but I knew that it wasn't actually mine until it payed out, so I never counted it toward my overall BTC balance and I can just shrug it off. It just sucks that I left my computer running all that time and wasted processing power and electricity for nothing.

Also SegWit hasn't been fully adopted yet. It's taking longer than I think most people expected, but it is happening. Same with LN. Things like that don't need to be rushed out. They need to be released after extensive testing. Once it's out and services start integrating it, we'll start to see the benefits and Bitcoin will get better as a currency again. Scaling just takes time.

Find a Lightning Network thread and read the comments. There's lots of FUD and misinformation floating around, most notably the idea that off-chain scaling and "hubs" introduces centralization and somehow makes transactions less secure. There's also concerns about complexity for mainstream usage and fees associated with opening and closing channels, among other things. I think it's just a highly misunderstood technology at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:50:17
What I don't understand is that the argument from core developers was never against increasing the block size. It was against rushing a block size increase without careful and thorough consideration and testing. Well now that 2x is gone, what are they doing now? We will need a block size increase eventually and with SegWit pretty much stalling at the moment, we could use it right now, but I've heard nothing about it. Is a block size increase even in development?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:46:52
The way I understand it is that it will be like a second account or wallet. You will just transfer funds from your main wallet to your Lightning wallet with the click (or tap) of a button and it will open a channel, so in that sense, it's automatic because you don't have to know what's going on behind the scenes. The thing I'm unclear on is who do you open a channel with and is that automatic or do you have to choose. From my experience using a testnet wallet, you don't even see that part. You just add funds, copy the merchant's Lightning address, and send it. If the real implementation will be anything like that, it will be dead simple.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:50:32
That's true. People just don't understand it. Sure, it's a risky investment and it could very well drop significantly (like we've recently seen) but it can't drop to zero without something going horribly wrong. We have a hard enough time finding consensus on forks and software upgrades. There's no way the entire market is going to sell and take the price down to zero. As long as nothing is broken, there will always be buyers.  
  
However, the price doesn't have to reach zero for you to effectively loose the majority of your investment. If, for example, you bought all of your Bitcoin at $19,000, you would be at a significant loss right now. I think that's what most people really mean when they say it could go to zero. They're basically saying it's an extremely high risk investment and you would be safer going into more traditional investments. Personally, Bitcoin is the first investment I've ever made. I believe in the technology and I believe it will increase in value. I could invest in something else, but seeing a small increase in value over the course of a year and a market that moves at a snail's pace is no fun. I like investing in Bitcoin because it is exciting. It's a roller coaster ride and I'm enjoying it. It's like seeing a technology growing and evolving right before my eyes. I'm only investing what I can afford to lose and if I hadn't invested, I would just be spending the money on stuff that I don't really need, so it's just a fun experiment for me. If it goes to a million dollars, awesome! If it goes to zero, oh well. It was fun while it lasted. Either way, I'm still okay financially.

Couldn't they try it out on testnet? You may be right that 2mb wouldn't help much but it would help nonetheless and since it will have to happen eventually, I think the sooner the better. I know the devs need to take their time and get it right (unlike the previous 2x fork) but some kind of time frame for a release date would be nice. I wonder if anyone is even working on it because I haven't seen anything.

It's getting there but many vending machines and parking meters are still cash only and even where contactless payment is accepted, it seems to be rarely used, at least in my area.

It looks like it's broken out for now so I'm not sure at the moment. After a correction, though, it usually forms an equilibrium pattern where the price starts bouncing up and down within a certain price range and it typically gets tighter and tighter. You can spot this pattern forming and (using chart tools) draw a trend line at the top connecting the points where price is bouncing down (resistance) and connect the bottom points where it's bouncing up (support). This should form a triangle and price will have no choice but to break out at some point. I usually try to buy at some point before it breaks out. Otherwise if there hasn't been a correction and price is just moving at a steady pace, I'll just buy regardless. Basically large price movements in a short period of time indicate instability and since I'm not a day trader, I try to stay away from that. I like to buy when it looks relatively stable. That said, I'm not trying to give advice because I don't know much about trading either. I'm just telling you what I do. As for the current price, I actually just bought because I didn't get paid until after the breakout and I think it's going back up. I didn't buy much, though, because I'm not super confident about it, so I won't lose much if it goes back down.

It doesn't even matter if customers want it. Most of their customers are new anyway and many of them probably don't even know what SegWit is. As a business, Coinbase should know that customers don't always know what they want until they have it. SegWit is a standard feature of Bitcoin now and it's something they need to implement as soon as possible to stay up to date, even if their customers aren't requesting it.

Hardware wallets and paper wallets are great options for large amounts. For small amounts there are numerous software wallets to choose from on various platforms such as PC or mobile. For PC, I've heard good things about Electrum and Mycelium is a popular mobile wallet (though they don't support SegWit yet). If you want an alternative to Coinbase, Gemini is a common suggestion. I just wouldn't suggest keeping your money on an exchange unless you're trading it, and even then, keep in mind that you're trusting a third party to hold your coins, so if something happens to the exchange, you could lose everything. MtGox and BTCe are good examples of that.

Who put the key there in the first place? How do you know that they didn't make a copy before applying the hologram? Unless there is some kind of process that obscures the private key from the creator themselves and they have a way of proving it, such as filming themselves making it, I don't see how any of these coins or paper wallets could be proven to be secure.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:27:50
Someone finds an exploit that allows them to steal funds from any wallet (not likely) or computers get sufficiently powerful enough to crack the encryption used and discover private keys. Basically, if something happens that breaks security at a fundamental level, Bitcoin immediately becomes worthless or worth very little until a fix is issued. If a fix is issued and the problem is not too detrimental (as in only one or a few people have access to the hack) then we could see a hard fork like ETC to ETH and the original Bitcoin could retain some value. If, however, an exploit is fount that everyone could potentially perform, I could see it going to $0 as exchanges would de-list it and no one would be able to or want to trade it. I don't think that's likely to ever happen though. People have been trying to hack Bitcoin for years and so far they've all been unsuccessful. The only way I can see it ever happening is if quantum computers (or a similarly powerful technology) becomes mainstream. Even then, I think we would see it coming well enough in advance and a hard fork could be issued ahead of time to increase security. Anyone left using the old Bitcoin would do so at their own risk.

I have been using it as a currency. I've bought Steam games with it (before they dropped support) and I have a Bitcoin debit card which I've occasionally used when I was short on cash. It's not very useful as a currency at the moment though, and I have to admit, I haven't used my debit card in a while because the fees are way too high. Bitcoin will need to scale before it can meet the demands of mainstream adoption and so far it hasn't been scaling fast enough to keep up, so currently it's far too slow and expensive to use for everyday purchases. I believe that will change eventually because there's already solutions in the works such as a Lightning Network. They just need time to be implemented and if Bitcoin is truly here to stay in the long run, the time it takes for it to scale will be insignificant years from now. In the meantime, yes, I am hoarding it. I can't deny that, but that's mainly because it's not very useful as a currency at the moment and the way the price keeps increasing, it only makes sense to hold it. I'm also buying in anticipation that I will be able to spend it directly someday and won't have to sell it, so whether you're using it as an investment, currency, or both, I stand by my word. HODL.

Reminds me of how Japan already has widespread use of contact-less payment, even for train passes and vending machines. Speaking of their vending machines, they're far more advanced than any you will find in the US as well. I think one thing that makes new technology work better and faster in Japan is the fact that it's a small, densely populated country. As a result, there's less infrastructure that needs to be built, so it can be built relatively quickly and inexpensively compared to countries like the US where there can be miles and miles of vast emptiness.
  
The only problem I see with Bitcoin being adopted is that it isn't ready for everyday use as a currency yet. The fees are still too high and transactions still take too long to confirm. Once we have a seamless integration of Lightning Network (or some other scaling solution) then it can go mainstream. Until that happens, though, I don't see it being widely adopted as a currency, even in Japan.

What I'm concerned about with a hard fork is what happens to existing infrastructure that has been built specifically for the current version of Bitcoin and requires consistent 24/7 operation? Things like payment processors (such as BitPay) and all the ATMs (or BTMs) scattered across the world. I doubt that many of those established businesses and operations are prepared for a hard fork. Some of them, such as the ATMs may have to be upgraded or replaced. Besides that, you also have all the people, businesses, etc. that are invested in Bitcoin but may not know about the hard fork, so they'll be left on the current version. I'm afraid that everything combined would cause a split in the user base rather than a smooth transition to the fork and it would hinder the growth of Bitcoin (or cryptocurrency in general) because the price would go down due to the user base being split between the two and the infrastructure would have to be rebuilt as people slowly begin to learn about and accept the new coin. (assuming they do accept it).  
  
I just think it's something that doesn't need to be done unless absolutely necessary and even then, it needs to be planned way ahead of time and there needs to be some sort of agreement, at least between all of the major companies involved to make it as seamless a transition as possible. What happened with Bitcoin Cash is a good example of how not to do it.

Personally I hope it doesn't correct any further than about $3500, but if it continues to follow the long term trend, it could go as low as around $1400. It's hard to know what could happen though, because it's already rallying and SegWit isn't even activated yet. Imagine what's going to happen when SegWit is active and all kinds of Lightning Network implementations and other improvements start coming out. It could keep the momentum going a while longer.

There is a speech by Andreas Antonopoulos where he talks about how many successful technologies exist while continuously failing to scale. The internet is a good example. There has always been a need for more bandwidth and there has always been discussion and concern about how the internet is going to fail because it can't handle the increasing rate of bandwidth consumption, yet somehow there are always improvements made just in time to keep it going. He talks about how Bitcoin is the same way. Bitcoin is failing to scale but just as it's hitting the 1MB wall, we're seeing scaling solutions being implemented. As Bitcoin grows and gains adoption in the future, it will fail to scale yet again, and like now, we'll see another scaling solution. Basically, the problems will never end, but they will be solved as they come along.

Paying for everything with Bitcoin can be really difficult if not impossible. I have a couple of credit cards which only seem to accept direct bank transfers, so even with a Bitcoin debit card, paying them off with Bitcoin is probably not an option. The only way I can see it being possible is if you keep a minimum amount of fiat in a checking account and every time you need to pay a bill, deposit just enough back into the account to cover it. Personally, I get my paycheck directly deposited into my checking account, so it's easier for me to just leave enough in there to cover bills, any unexpected charges, etc., use the rest to buy Bitcoin, and then use a Bitcoin debit card for everyday purchases.

You're right that it's essentially gambling, but there's a difference. When you're playing roulette, the house generally has an edge and, like you say, you may get lucky but you will lose over time. Trading, however, is different. If you're an experienced trader, you can analyze  the price movement and use indicators such as MACD, RSI, etc. to your advantage, essentially flipping the odds and making you the house. Experienced traders will still lose occasionally but technical analysis will put the odds in their favor, giving them a net profit over time. Is it better than HODLing? I don't know. Both methods can be profitable. I suppose it depends on how experienced you are and how much risk you're willing to take.

If you don't intend to trade, you should NOT keep it in any exchange. When you set up a wallet, it will essentially be an empty wallet that you will transfer your funds to, so you will not need to import your public/private keys. It will create a new set of keys, and depending on the wallet, a backup seed/phrase as well. You will need to make a copy of the backup phrase (or keys if a backup phrase is not available) and keep it in a safe place. It will be needed if you ever loose access to your wallet and need to restore it. To transfer the funds to your wallet, just send them to the wallet's public address. Keep in mind that depending on your wallet, the public address you see can change periodically as you make transactions but each one remains valid and permanently associated with your wallet.

This same guy says that EVERY porn site you visit on your cell phone remotely roots it and installs keyloggers. I'm not sure how much truth there is to that but I know that not every cell phone has been rooted yet and I'm sure not every single porn site does that. It just sounds like either straight up lies or paranoia. As for his stance on Bitcoin, I think I read somewhere that he met up with Jihan Wu, so he's probably just been fed propaganda and from what I've seen, I don't think he's very knowledgeable on the subject, so he probably just went with whatever he was told. He has some interesting insights into security, but given his reputation, I don't trust anything that comes out of his mouth.

Who knows how long it will stay at $300+ though. It's currently in a down trend and for all we know, it could drop to double digits in a few days. I think Coinbase is playing it safe by waiting until January. That will be enough time to see if it's holding up or if it fails.

I've never understood how Bitcoin works with taxes. Do you have to report anything? Does it depend on how much? What kind of transactions? Only exchanging fiat? What about bitcoin debit debit cards?

I did. I sold as soon as I got off work. I did glance at the price, but I was determined to sell regardless. BCH has no value to me and since I was in possession of some of it, I sold it as soon as possible so I could be done with it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:35:05
I think if you set the fee too small or if there's no fee (not sure if that's possible) the transaction can get stuck and eventually dropped, leaving the funds in the source wallet. I'm guessing you could manipulate the system by doing that. I've also heard of double spending, though I'm not sure how that works.

I bought a $400 laptop some time in 2013. Seemed like a good idea at the time but in hindsight it was a terrible idea. I couldn't afford to replace that BTC before the price went up and I actually lost interest and kind of forgot about Bitcoin for a while. I just bought back in at $2500 and if I had kept that $400, it would be worth over $1000. (also, after checking my transaction history, I once bought a $25 gift card that would be worth over $200 now. Ouch)

Bitcoin is an infinite investment as far as I'm concerned. If I ever need fiat, I withdraw whatever I need and replace the missing funds as soon as possible. I'm not even selling if the price stabilizes because at that point, you'll probably be able to buy most things with Bitcoin directly, so there will be no reason to sell.

I've been analyzing historical data and doing hypothetical trades as well. I won't even pretend to understand how most of the indicators work but I'm trying to learn. So far I've mainly been drawing arbitrary lines, looking at what led to tops and bottoms, and trying to predict breakouts. I'm getting a better understanding of it, but I'm not confident enough to trade for real yet.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:07:52
The problem is a business can't just drop support for one version of Bitcoin and switch to another because they would be dropping support for a large portion of their customers who haven't switched over yet. They would either have to add support for both coins and slowly fade the old one out, or give their customers a deadline to switch over. I'm just not sure how a hard fork could be implemented smoothly without causing problems because the current version is already so well established.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:54:37
Download a Bitcoin wallet program/app. When you set it up, it will walk you through the steps of creating a wallet and generating your public and private keys. Then you just hit send on the exchange, copy the public address (or scan a QR code of it) from your new private wallet, paste it in the send form on the exchange, specify the amount, and initiate the transfer. Just make sure to back up your private wallet first. Most wallets walk you through that step when you set them up.  
  
Another thing I'd like to point out. It kind of annoys me when people say "take all your money off the exchange". It's true that it's safer in your own wallet that you control (as long as you take the proper precautions) but some people intend to trade, so you have to keep some on an exchange if you want to trade it. If you intend to trade, I would still suggest taking most of your money out, but keep a small amount on the exchange for trading purposes or else you will have to constantly move BTC in and out. Each transaction is charged a fee and it takes time for each one to get confirmed by the network, so I don't think it makes sense to take it all out after every single trade.  
  
Also, Coinbase is not a trading exchange. You can use it that way to some extent, but it doesn't have all of the features that a trading exchange has. Coinbase actually has their own exchange called GDAX, but there are numerous others such as Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, and HitBTC.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:17:04
Look at how well that worked out for people who had their money in Mt. Gox or BTC-e. No matter if you're a "geek" or an average Joe, you should never keep your money on an exchange unless you're willing to take the risk of losing it. It can't be helped if you're trading it, but even then it's a good idea to periodically take some of the profits and transfer them to a wallet where you control the keys. If you're not comfortable with doing that, you probably shouldn't be into crypto.

I'm not saying whether I support 2x or not and I'm not giving in just because one wins out over the other. If it comes to that and I don't support the winning side, I'll just take my money out. I'm just stating what I feel is the safest thing to do to protect your investment if you have a lot of money involved.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:20:02
You'll definitely get burnt if you buy and hold but if you already own BCH due to the fork, I'm not sure if you'll be affected by holding. I expect the price to more or less correlate with BTC, so if the price of BCH goes down, I expect the price of BTC to go up due to the sell-off. The only way I can see this not happening is if a large portion of the sell-off goes to fiat or altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:18:51
I had a similar issue with the Jaxx mobile wallet. I didn't notice any missing transactions or if they were unconfirmed but  my balance was wrong. Instead of 0.19 BTC, I had 0.12. Fortunately after they lifted the restriction on transactions, it magically fixed itself. I'm guessing this all has something to do with the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:15:32
Exactly. I'm not against a 2x hardfork, but I am against a rushed hardfork such as this one. Even core says that they're not opposed to a hardfork. It just needs more careful planning and more widespread consensus so it doesn't create a divide in the community like this one is going to do. This as well as the BCH hardfork were recklessly rushed out. If Bitcoin manages to make it through all of this nonsense, it will truly be a resilient currency. I can't help but wonder what Andreas Antonopoulos thinks about all of this.
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:06:01
Same thing. The official Bitcoin Cash website calls it BCC but there is already a coin with that symbol so BCH was proposed as a better alternative.

Actually if enough people start using it as a currency, it will be a good test of SegWit and Lightning Network once it gets implemented. I can't wait to see which scaling solution wins out, bigger blocks, SegWit, or a combination of the two with SegWit2x. I'm not rooting for any particular solution. I just hope the best one wins out.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:45:11
One theory I've heard is that it's just returning to what it should have been if BCH hadn't been a thing. Personally, I think it's a little too high though. Here's a thing I drew about a month ago and I still think that's roughly where it should be. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:49:50
Okay, that's a little rude. I'm just pointing out what I've been observing for the past month or so, but you do have a point. If I don't know what I'm talking about, I shouldn't be talking about it, so my apologies if I've said anything that isn't true. Since you seem to have a better understanding of the situation, do you mind explaining it for those of us that don't? I would love to know the truth so if anyone else asks I can tell them without spreading misinformation.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:45:45
I don't know anything about Copay, so I can't answer that. I don't have any experience with sending to email either. All I know is that you can send to your wallet by entering the wallet's public address in the send form on the exchange.  
  
When you hit "sell" you are locked in at that price. The transaction happens immediately but depending on where you're sending it, it can take a while to clear. If you sell your BTC but keep your fiat on the exchange, it's probably instant, but if you send it to a bank account it could take days.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:08:13
Really? How does it work then? I would love to know so I can make some sweet profits. The way I see it though, we've broken through the previous all time high and from now on, we're staying above it. If there wasn't so much positive news around Bitcoin, I could see it falling back down a bit, but with BCH, SegWit activation, and then actual SegWit implementation and possibly Lightning Network later on, I think there's enough bullish momentum to take it higher. If I'm wrong, please explain why. Just saying "that's definitely not how it works" isn't helpful.

I think I read somewhere that people don't trust the Electron Cash fork because it's closed source and there is a chance someone could gain access to your funds, though I'm not sure about that. Personally, I used it, but only because I didn't want to download the entire blockchain and I didn't know of a better alternative. I still took precautions though. I transfered my BTC to another wallet first so if my private keys were stolen, at least they wouldn't have access to my BTC. I then imported the private keys into Electron Cash and as quickly as possible I transferred it all into an exchange so I could sell it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:35:58
Mission accomplished! Actually, we shot right past it and went to $4400, but now we're back down to $3900. Still, it's two weeks later and we're right around 4k. Maybe with SegWit activation we can reach 5k in two more weeks.

BCC was the original proposed symbol but it's already in use by BitConnect Coin, so to avoid confusion, some exchanges have begun calling it BCH instead. Some are also calling it "Bcash" instead of "Bitcoin Cash" to avoid confusing it with Bitcoin as well. Ironically, all of these different terms are confusing people even more.

There's a lot of things they didn't think of. The whole thing seems like a hasty copy/paste project with a few alterations here and there. Even one of the wallets, Electron Cash is a carbon copy of Electrum, and the "BCC" symbol is already in use by BitConnect Coin. They either didn't look it up or they didn't care. It's pitiful, really, but as bad as I feel for some of its supporters who don't know any better, I don't have any pity whatsoever for the developers or anyone who helped release this trash.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:23:04
That was a pump. From what I can gather, it seems that it happened due to BCH being listed on Korean exchanges, so there were a lot of new investors all at once. Looks like it's heading back down now. Also you think BTC is going to crash with SegWit one day away? I know the price is high but I think there's just too much positive sentiment for that to happen. We'll see.
Edit: Aaand it did crash. It didn't correlate with BCH though, and I still expect it to go back up once SegWit is activated.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:13:13

I expect Bitcoin to go up more than Litecoin did. It's more popular and mainstream than Litecoin and the scaling debate has been going on for a long time. It will be a major and exciting event for many people when SegWit is finally activated. Given the future implementations that will be made possible by SegWit and the fact that it's happening on the most popular coin, I expect the price to not only outperform Litecoin, but to continue upwards for a long time to come. Then again, maybe I'm just overly optimistic.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:41:47
How does this affect people who may not know of this issue and have funds in a Bitpay or Copay wallet? Will those wallets switch to the 2x version without their knowledge and possibly cause their funds to drop in value?

So if I understand correctly, you will basically open a channel with a hub and as long as the merchant you're doing business with is also open with that hub (or network of hubs?) you will be able to process a transaction while also keeping the channel open for more transactions with other merchants? So I'm guessing this means that you will not need to open a channel with a payment processor in order to pay multiple merchants on the same channel. How will this work in a wallet? Will you just transfer your BTC from your regular wallet to your "LN wallet" and then all of the routing would be done behind the scenes, so when you pay a merchant via your "LN wallet" it will go through automatically? How will opening and closing channels work? Will that be an automatic process in the background, and if so, will the user see unexpected fees pop up when the channel eventually closes on them or will it close when you spend all of your "LN wallet" or when you transfer it back to your regular wallet? All of this is so confusing to me and it has to be simplified if it's going to work for the mainstream.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:32:38
I'm not sure I understand completely (which is why I brought up the concerns) but after reading your explanation, I'm under the impression that in the case of a carefully planned hard fork, all of the miners would have to agree to move their hashing power to the new fork and the old one would be discarded. The name, ticker symbol, and everything associated with it would move to the new fork and all users would have to do is upgrade their software. Is this correct? If that's the case, I'll feel a bit more relieved.

Let's say I have my coins in a personal wallet with access to my keys and backup phrase, and let's say I stop buying/selling around the time of the hard fork. Is there any risk of my funds losing value? If I understand correctly (given what happened with the Bcash hard fork) my funds will be cloned across both versions, so if I'm not sure which one to support, I could just wait it out and eventually sell the less valuable one and actually make a profit off the whole situation. So basically, if I have my funds in a secure wallet and be patient, I'll be fine no matter which version wins out. Is this correct?

In the meantime, if you want to use Bitcoin to pay for everyday things, maybe consider a Bitcoin debit card. Some of them convert BTC to fiat automatically upon transacting and others work like prepaid cards that you have to "top-up". Also, regarding PayPal, I wouldn't be surprised if they integrate Bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:11:07
Look at the price historically. Bitcoin has been this volatile in the past. Currently, I think much of it has to do with the scaling proposals. Since the hard fork went over without affecting BTC too much and SegWit is still happening, there is a lot positivity and bullish momentum. There are also some exciting implications following a successful scaling solution such as Lightning Network and lower fees which is likely driving the price up further and may keep it going as long as the technology is being developed and implemented. I expect the price to become a bit more stable at some point, but who knows when that will be.

I'm fairly new here, but from what I've been able to gather, some people were banned from and they felt that it was unjust, so they went to r/btc. Ever since then they've had a grudge against r/Bitcoin and for whatever reason, most of them seem to be "big blockers" and anti-SegWit. I'm not sure how that came about but now you have r/Bitcoin rooting for SegWit/UASF/LN and r/btc rooting for Bitcoin Cash/big blocks/Satoshi's vision/following the whitepaper. At this point it seems to have degenerated into a petty war between the two and I've noticed lately that even some people on this sub are stooping to immature memes and name calling.

When you have a Bitcoin debit card, I think it's best to choose one that doesn't rely on an exchange. I use BitPay which works with their wallet which allows me to access the private keys.

This is exactly what I intend to do. I know it's risky but I believe in the future adoption and utility of Bitcoin (or some form of cryptocurrency) so I recently bought a BitPay debit card and every week I exchange most of my paycheck for Bitcoin. I haven't started spending it yet, but when I do, I'll just transfer what I intend to spend to my BitPay wallet and then either buy directly with Bitcoin if a business accepts it or use the debit card. Either way, at least I won't have fiat sitting in a checking account slowly loosing purchasing power.

People were arguing about this even before that. I remember when I was into Bitcoin back in 2013 and the price was well below $1000 (I foolishly sold it all to buy a laptop), people were arguing about it back then. In fact, I think it's always been a concern but it can't seem to gain mass adoption. I think the reason is because Bitcoin is still extremely volatile and mostly just an investment rather than a currency. Many people have large amounts of BTC so the larger unit makes more sense. The only way I can see a smaller unit becoming popular is if it starts being used as a currency with lots of small transactions. I'm hoping that will happen with Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:04:49
Does this mean that Bitcoin should continue to increase in value even after mass adoption due to lost coins creating scarcity? If that's the case, I'm okay with that.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:23:29
Honestly, I wouldn't mind if it goes down a bit further in the short term so I can buy more. I know it's no fun when you're HODLing or bought in at the top and it corrects and it's boring when it consolidates and there's not much price movement, but overall corrections and consolidations are healthy because otherwise the price would soar out of control and then we'd have a huge crash which would hurt a lot of people. The situation we're in now is great because even if you panic sold at the top, you didn't lose too much and if you haven't been able to buy lately, it gives you a chance to get in before the next rally. It's also a great trading opportunity if you know what you're doing.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:08:31
There's no point in using the Bitcoin blockchain for everyday purchases. That's true. It's overkill and inefficient, but that's what Lightning Network is meant to be for. You will use the LN to buy your stick of gum, coffee, etc. and all of those small transactions will be bundled together into a single, more significant transaction that will be settled on the blockchain. You're still using Bitcoin, but you're not spamming up the blockchain with individual small transactions anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:55:02
I would suggest not trying to time the market. Looking at historical data, it's obvious where the tops and bottoms are, but it's impossible to know for certain where they will be in the future. For example, you could see a price increase and decide to sell, and then instead of going down, the price continues to rise. If you believe in the long term success of Bitcoin, I would suggest holding indefinitely and buying periodically on the way up (dollar cost averaging/DCA). You can spend a little here and there, but replace what you spend as soon as possible to maintain profit.  
  
That said, you can try trading the market if you wish, but most traders loose money so you'll need to make sure you know what you're doing. In any case, from one new investor to another, good luck!

I bought at $8260. Definitely feels good. I knew it had been consolidating for a while and was due for a breakout but I wasn't sure if it would break up or down. I went ahead and bought because I knew if it fell, it would likely recover eventually, so I felt like it was worth the risk.

You have a point about the car memes. I think the deflationary nature of Bitcoin will cause a reduction in consumerism but not to the extent that many people think. Personally, I'm one of those car people too. My rationale is that even though I could save that money and possibly see future gains, what's the point of saving if I never spend it on anything?
 I have goals for my savings and one of them is a Tesla Model 3 or something similar. Sure I could wait a while and it would probably become cheaper and cheaper over time but I'm not going to live forever and I would rather have a nice car sooner rather than later. Basically, my point is that even if a currency increases in value, it won't stop people from buying what they want or need. It will encourage saving and slow down spending but it won't stop it altogether because at some point, no matter how much it costs, people will buy things to maintain a quality way of life. I think Bitcoin or at least some form of deflationary currency will be good for the economy and would help bring a bit of balance between saving and spending.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:13:06
Actually I've thought about doing that. I have credit cards I need to pay off first and increase my credit score before I can finance anything though. The problem is, I'm making more by investing in Bitcoin than the interest charges on my credit cards so I can't bring myself to pay them off. I would rather make regular payments on them while investing the rest. So at the rate I'm going, it's going to be a couple of years before I can buy a Tesla. I'm fine with that though, because by then hopefully they'll have production ramped up so I don't have to wait years before actually receiving one and I'll have increased my BTC holdings as well.

You don't need a ton of cash to get into Bitcoin. You can buy a small fraction of you want, even as little as a few dollars. (or quid in your case)  
  


  
If the price keeps rising, it's well worth it. Even if you only make a small profit, it's better than nothing.


  
You don't have to download the blockchain to own Bitcoin. That's only if you want to contribute to the network by running a full node. All you really need is a wallet which typically takes up very little space, or no space at all if it's a paper or hardware wallet.  
  
In fact, signing up on an exchange and linking a bank account or debit card is probably the most difficult part. After that, owning Bitcoin is as easy as going on the exchange of choice, typing in how much you want to buy, waiting for it to arrive, and then transferring it to a wallet.

You're right. I'm sorry about that. It's been so long since I studied Japanese that I forgot how that worked. What I was thinking of was the fact that "n" cannot be used to start a word. There are definitely Hiragana and Katakana words that have "n" in the middle of them. One that comes to mind is pantsu (パンツ)

That is true for the most part. Most characters are syllables ending in a vowel but "n" is an exception. For example, the Japanese word for Japan is "Nihon" or "Nippon", both ending in "n". There are also some words where a syllable starts with two consonants. In the case of "Bitcoin" it would be spelled bi-tto-ko-i-n (ビットコイン).

I first got into Bitcoin back in 2013 so I've had plenty of time to get used to the volatility. I have a routine where I usually buy every week regardless of the price but when I see it spike like it did from 9k to 11k, I stop buying because I know there's a correction incoming. It's just the way it's always been. At this point, I could probably profit off the corrections but I've never taken the time to figure out how to trade them properly, especially when I can't be watching the chart the entire time. In any case, I always wait until the price drops, consolidates for a while, and then I wait for it to stabilize a bit before I buy more. For example, this time my last buy was at $8260, so I'm still at a profit even with the correction. Now I'll wait for the volatility to die down and see where the price finally lands and I'll probably try to buy more before it breaks out again, or wait until it just starts to break out and see which way it goes. Basically what I'm saying is that if you know how the price behaves, you can prepare for the corrections ahead of time so they won't be a problem, and if you're good at it you can actually profit off them.

It's not the currency, it's the implementation of it. If Steam accepted Bitcoin directly or used a payment processor that didn't charge their own fees, it wouldn't be so bad. Miner fees are still too high regardless but there are second layer solutions in the works that aim to help with that. For now, Bitcoin isn't great for small purchases like Steam but it's already miles ahead of fiat when it comes to transferring money around the world.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:53:07
What I do is dollar/cost averaging. I buy some when I get paid regardless of the price and then buy more if it dips or if it looks like it's due for a breakout.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:42:20
You're absolutely right. I was trying to make my explanation short and simple but in doing so, I was a bit misleading. It's been a while since I studied Japanese, but if I recall correctly, when a word contains two consonants next to each other (such as "Nippon" or "Bittokoin" it's actually a single consonant-vowel character that has its consonant extended so you put more emphasis on it. In Japanese, the extra emphasis is characterized by a small "tsu" symbol and when Romanized, it's just an extra consonant. For example, Nippon is ni(に), p(っ), po(ぽ), n(ん) (though in Japanese it's usually spelled using the Kanji characters 日本)  
  
Also to further clarify my previous post, the "n" character is completely separate from the "n" that is used with a vowel, so it uses a separate symbol. For the "n" sound, you have na(な), ni(に), nu(ぬ), ne(ね), no(の), and n(ん).  
  
I could go on and on (and I would love to) but I'm already getting off topic. I just find the language fascinating and though I still have a lot of learning to do, I always love to help others learn as well.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:09:13

Another way to look at it is when you're young with very little to no financial responsibility it doesn't hurt to go all in. If it falls to $0 oh well.

I use Coinbase so yeah, the fees are bad.

Yep. Python 2.7.13 to be exact, along with TkInter for the GUI. It was a beginner programming class and Python is the only language we were taught. Despite how simple it looks, it's actually well beyond the scope of the class which only covered the very basic concepts of programming. To be honest, I spent way too much time on the GUI and not enough time learning the language itself, which was evident when I entered a programming competition and lost because all I could manage to make was the GUI.  
  
Anyway, I haven't done any programming at all since then. It was just fun to dig this up after all these years and see how outdated it is with MtGox and BTC-e included in the list of exchanges. The whole concept is outdated now due to websites like preev.com that do basically the exact same thing, but it was useful at the time.  
  
Actually, now that I think about it, there was one thing I meant to do that would have set it apart. I wanted to include a way to set a custom price per coin so you could see how much it would be worth at any given exchange rate. I actually included code for that, but it only worked if it couldn't retrieve live exchange data.

You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. A pyramid scheme works by paying members to recruit more members who, in turn, recruit more members in such a way that the earliest members get paid the most. There is no such business model in Bitcoin. It's a currency. You can buy it, sell it, or hold it as an investment at your own free will. Getting others involved won't make you any money. As for speculators (read early investors) getting rich, that happens with any successful technology. It doesn't make it a pyramid scheme just because some people got rich and others got burned. That's just how investing works. I'd argue that most buyers that are HODLing believe in usefulness of the technology, otherwise why would they expect large gains? It's not because they're expecting to get rich, but because they see the opportunity to get in on something revolutionary.

Bitcoin is not remotely similar to a bag of gold or any other physical form of value, so that's not a fair comparison. Bitcoin is digital so it can be integrated into POS systems and if the merchant doesn't want to accept the currency directly, they can use payment processors like BitPay to easily and quickly convert it to fiat. In fact, companies like Overstock.com, Steam, Bic Camera (large retail chain in Japan), and even Microsoft are already accepting Bitcoin, so I don't see what the problem is. As far as merchants are concerned, it's just another form of payment. The only issue I can think of is the cost of installing or updating POS terminals in brick-and-morter stores. As for online stores, it's just a matter of adding an extra payment option.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:50:09
Why do retailers accept Paypal? Why do grocery stores accept EBT cards? For that matter, why do they still accept checks when they are slow and inconvenient? It gives more options to consumers, especially those who may not have or want to use credit cards and more options means more potential customers for merchants. If Bitcoin becomes popular it would make sense for retailers to accept it because otherwise they're missing out on those customers who want to use it.

They just added BCH support to their wallet like many others have already been doing. What's wrong with that?

If the USB port is broken it will be useless (unless you can return it or repair it yourself) but as long as you wrote down the 24 word seed you can just import your Bitcoins into another wallet. Of course you would still have to replace the hardware wallet but this is a hypothetical situation. Unless you're careless or happened to get a defective unit, it's not likely that you'll break the USB port any time soon. I believe Micro USB ports are rated for 10,000 plug/unplug cycles.

Good point. I didn't think of that. If you're looking to sell right away, maybe it is better to keep your BTC on an exchange because you won't have to worry about splitting and moving it. All you'll have to do is hit "sell". No matter what you do, it's a risk. You don't know what Coinbase will do and you don't know what the price will do. If it's anything like BCH, it could go up in value before it goes back down. Personally, I'm just going to hold both until this all blows over just to be safe. If S2X goes to zero, I'll still have my BTC, and vice versa, so nothing lost either way.

On the other hand, what if Goofus sells, intending to buy back in at a lower price, but it never dips that far and instead he panic buys higher? Sure, Goofus could get lucky, but the takeaway here is that Gallant believes in the long term success of Bitcoin and by holding and buying the dips, he's still making a profit but without the risk of trying to time the market, which you should only do if you're an experienced trader.

The thing I don't like about Ledger Nano S is that it looks very similar to a USB thumb drive, so it would be easy to misplace. (or for someone else to misplace if you accidentally leave it lying around) Also, I've heard that the swivel cover can get loose over time.

If you go with a paper wallet I would recommend keeping it in a fireproof safe, (or in a fireproof bag inside a regular safe) though I would also be concerned about loosing it. Personally, if you plan to keep buying I would recommend going ahead and buying a hardware wallet. It would be much better because it would have the safety of a paper wallet, the versatility to send/receive with a software wallet, and the ability to back it up with a list of seed words. It's still a good idea to keep the seed words in a safe but you can keep the hardware wallet anywhere and use it anytime you want.

From the looks of it, it will be similar to the Bitpay debit card in that it will be a prepaid card that you add funds to directly from your Bitcoin wallet. I suppose the main advantage is that it is more convenient, but I think it's cheaper as well. If it's anything like Bitpay, both your Bitcoin and debit card accounts will show up in an app. You type in the amount you want to transfer to your card and then you should be able to use it instantly. I'm not sure how it compares to, say, Coinbase's Shift Card, but I have a BitPay card and I find it's very convenient when you want to make frequent purchases with Bitcoin.

Almost no one accepts it yet because it's still in early adoption. Give it time and Bitcoin will become much more useful. It's like when credit cards first came out and no one accepted them.

This is one of the main reasons Mycelium needs to add SegWit support as soon as possible. Lower fees are attractive and increasing adoption is good, but by not supporting SegWit, they're locking out a lot of Trezor users that have already migrated to SegWit addresses.

I think their BTC is already in Coinbase and they're referring to moving it from Coinbase's "cold storage vault" to the regular Coinbase wallet, which will enable them to buy/sell. If that's the case, I would personally recommend them to go ahead and move their coins to a private wallet ahead of time because despite what Coinbase claims, you can't be 100% certain what they will do during the fork. Theoretically, they should split your coins for you and allow you to safely sell your S2X coins for BTC, considering they are an exchange, but if you control the keys and do everything correctly, you should be able to split the coins yourself, at which point you can do whatever you want with them.

That makes sense but ultimately I think Bitcoin will need to be integrated into the same POS systems that credit cards are used with. For example, there could be a "Pay With Bitcoin" button on the screen, press it, and then the QR code pops up, or if it becomes popular enough, have the QR code show up by default. Alternatively, there could be a new standard released that allows NFC payments, so all you have to do is hold your phone up to the terminal and then confirm the transaction.

It's not a flat fee. It seems to be in sets. For example $1.99-$10 is $0.99, $11-$26 is 1.49, $27-$51 is $1.99, etc. Try typing in different amounts and you will see the fee change. As for GDAX, I've been thinking about buying there as well. I've read that while there is no fee (or lower fee, I forgot) you have to pay whatever the price is once the money arrives in your account, not necessarily when you make the purchase. Then again, I've read that Coinbase is going to start offering instant ACH deposits, so that may solve that issue.

Everyone else? What makes you think everyone else is going along with 2X? There is a very clear NO2X movement and there are already some NYA signers defecting from the agreement. Replay protection or not, there are going to be two chains. For there to be only one chain, everyone would have to agree with 2X (at least the miners would, anyway) and that's not going to happen at this point.

If Bitcoin is going to succeed it has to be accepted by merchants like Amazon and just because the technology can't handle a high volume of traffic right now doesn't mean it won't in the future. In fact, that's one of the issues Lightning Network is supposed to address.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:09:54
I have to agree with here. BCC is just a copy of the BTC blockchain (with bigger blocks/whatever) so no one has any obligations to access the funds just because someone decided to create it. If you want to trade BCC, that's up to you, but you can't expect exchanges to change up what they're doing just because someone decided to make an altcoin using the BTC blockchain.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:11:32

Just download a wallet program such as Electrum. I personally use Jaxx because it supports alt coins as well and allows you to exchange between them. In any case, a wallet program/app will generate a set of keys for you that you can transfer your bitcoins to. Personally, if I had a large sum of money, I would probably consider a hardware wallet for added security.

BIP 38 basically encrypts your private key with a passphrase. The encrypted private key is printed on the wallet and the passphrase is stored elsewhere. This way, even if your wallet is stolen or compromised, as long as you have access to your passphrase, your funds are safe.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:16:54
Like I posted in another thread, no one, including exchanges, is obligated to acknowledge BCC unless they want to. Just because someone copies the BTC blockchain and makes an altcoin out of it doesn't mean anyone has to react to it and it certainly doesn't mean exchanges have to change what they're doing and support it. Imagine if tons of people were making BTC altcoins. What would exchanges do then? Sure they can access BCC if they want to, but it would be a shady business practice and I'm sure they would be found out eventually. Any reputable exchange that decides to ignore BCC will do just that and if you don't trust them (not saying you should) just withdraw your BTC. That's all you have to do.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:50:07
How could there be legal action? Think about it. What's to stop anyone from forking off, copying the blockchain, and making their own version of Bitcoin? Coinbase is not going to support just any and every fork that happens and just because someone decides to do it doesn't mean that exchanges are held legally accountable for the funds in those copied blockchains. Basically, Coinbase is just doing business as usual with BTC. They are not obligated to change the way they run their business just because someone copied the blockchain and made an altcoin. It's the users responsibility if they want access to it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:23:36
I tried something like that once. However, I think the server I played on had a rule that you had to play normally and anyone caught blatantly farming for BTC would be banned. It made no sense because the highest ranked players had to farm constantly to get there.

That sucks. We have a similar delay with Coinbase but the price is locked in at whatever it was when you bought it. Personally, I bought at 2190 and 1987, though the majority of my bitcoin was bought at 2571, so I haven't really made my money back yet.
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:15:12
Nothing will happen to your BTC. They will be fine. What's going to happen is the blockchain (up until the split) will be duplicated, which means your funds will also exist on the alternate blockchain. It will not affect the funds on the current blockchain. Your public and private keys will be the same for both, so if you wish, you can access your alt funds with a compatible wallet, or you can leave them alone or even ignore their existence. Personally, I plan to use an exchange and dump my alt BTC as soon as possible and add it to my real BTC balance.

The only way I know to get around the fee is to adjust it in your wallet of choice. There is a problem with that for small transactions, though. The smaller the fee, the longer it takes to get confirmations. If the business accepts 0 confirmation transactions, it's fine. Use the lowest fee possible. However, if they require at least 1, you may be waiting a while if you use the lowest fee. Fortunately, this is something that SegWit should help alleviate and Lightning Network should be able to fix altogether.

I love seeing these pop up everywhere. It's got to be good for informing the public about bitcoin but I don't see how it makes sense for the business owner.

I haven't looked into why they feel the need to implement a hard fork, but I'm with you on that. It sounds like a bad idea to me. In fact, after reading a bit more about SegWit and SegWit2x, I edited my comment to be more neutral because I really find the whole thing a bit confusing and I'm not taking either side. I am leaning more toward a soft fork, though, because I'm afraid if there's a hard fork, coins will be doubled and the value could drop considerably. Of course, if it only drops by half, you could just exchange all your coins into one version of the currency, but then who's to say that version will win out? I could see people loosing lots of money if there's a hard fork.

Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin by definition. Everyone is signalling SegWit and they're forking off from it to do their own thing because they don't agree with the consensus. Maybe it will gain traction and the current version will become an altcoin but as it stands, that's not likely to happen. However, given that your question relates to an upcoming fork of bitcoin, I think it's still relevant to this sub. Regarding your question, I don't have an answer as I'm not familiar with that exchange and it's likely that no one knows except them. Personally, I would widthdraw all BTC from exchanges before August 1 (or even before July 31). You can see how they handle the situation and act accordingly afterwards, either trading the alt coin or exchanging it for BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:03:11
Why would I support a fork that doesn't help bitcoin in any way? It shouldn't even exist. We have SegWit and possibly the 2x part (we'll see about that) but BCC was never part of the plan. It's just an altcoin created by a group of people who had their own agenda and didn't agree with SegWit2x. I do care about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general and I am concerned with how BCC will affect bitcoin, but I don't support it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:31:23
Where is the profit if almost no one uses it though? Also, another problem I just discovered is the exchange rate on these ATMs is ridiculous. I found some that charge $3000 per bitcoin when exchanges were charging around $2700 at the time. I understand the convenience factor for the average person who doesn't want to deal with the hassle of setting up an exchange account, but it's still a ripoff and people like myself will never use them with prices like that. On top of that, many of them only exchange fiat to BTC, so if you're wanting to sell your BTC, you're out of luck.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:55:53
If you're in the US, Coinbase is a popular choice. I think some people don't bother using exchanges because you have to jump through a few hoops to set up your account such as identity verification and linking a bank account. ATMs could be useful in those cases, or in situations where you need cash immediately and all you have is BTC. In that case, though, I would recommend a bitcoin debit card. I'm not sure about all of them, but with a Bitpay card, you can use your phone to load money from your wallet at current exchange price, wait 1 confirmation, and then it's available to spend. Much better than paying a huge markup at an ATM.

Whatever you choose, I would suggest resisting the urge to sell. If anything, take advantage of this dip to buy a bit more and just put off building your computer a few more weeks or months. Either that, or save up with fiat so you don't have to wait for the price to go back up. Personally, I consider bitcoin nothing but an investment right now. I buy little things here and there with it, but I mostly just buy and HODL, making all of my major purchases with fiat. I made the mistake of buying something expensive with bitcoin once and I was never able to replace the bitcoin I spent before the price shot up. So my suggestion, HODL. Always HODL. Oh, and that $10 MIR, you'll have that covered easily once bitcoin recovers. That said, this isn't financial advice. It's just my opinion and what I would do in your situation.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:26:30
That makes me wonder, would it be safe to just exchange all of my BTC for Litecoin (or some other altcoin), then exchange it back after the split? That way I wouldn't have to worry about having coins on both chains.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:29:58
Bear in mind that you won't be able to simply transfer the balance and double your BTC. You will be trading the alt coin for whatever it's worth, which will likely be much less. I'm just hoping it doesn't bring down the price of real BTC with it.

The security issues with Jaxx are twofold. One, the 12 word recovery phrase is stored unencrypted on the device, and two, it uses a four digit pin number rather than a password, which is much less secure. Both issues are connected, apparently. Supposedly the reasoning behind the low security is that pin numbers are more convenient than passwords and your device should be secure in the first place. If your device is secure, anything on it will be secure. Personally, I'm not buying it because there's always the possibility for a hacker to gain access. That said, I actually use the wallet, both the android and Windows version. I don't have much money in it so the small risk is worth the convenience for me.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:15:32
This gets me thinking, if there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, what happens as bitcoins become lost, the supply goes down and the value goes up? What if it gets to the point that 1 satoshi is worth more than 1 cent or even 1 dollar? Is it possible to implement a BIP to divide bitcoin into even more units/denominations?
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:01:04
I'm going through the same process. It's been about a week now and still waiting.
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:17:50
The difference is, the value of the dollar changes very slowly compared to Bitcoin. You can expect to pay around the same price for something day after day and it changes so slowly that the perceived value becomes ingrained in your mind. Something may go up 10 cents in a month but you may not even notice because prices differ slightly from one business to another. As long as you have a base price ingrained in your mind, you have an idea of the value and you can spot good deals. With Bitcoin, however, you never have any remote idea what the value is. If you're a business, you can't price things in BTC unless you're willing to constantly adjust the price and you can't expect customers to buy your goods based solely on that price because they can't tell what the value of that price is. Without looking it up, they can't tell if they're getting a good deal or if you're price gauging. That means the only way you can really price things in Bitcoin right now is along with another currency for reference. Once Bitcoin stabilizes to an appropriate level, people can begin to associate value with it and reference currencies will no longer be necessary. Another thing to point out is that as long as the price of Bitcoin is volatile, it's extremely risky for a business to accept Bitcoin without immediately cashing out into fiat because for all they know, that money could be worthless tomorrow. There again, it needs to stabilize before it can be used on its own.

I bought my old laptop with Bitcoin back when it was worth about $400 USD. Now I'm finally getting back into it and I'm remembering how much I loved the ride. I never know what's going to happen so I'm always watching the price, but despite the fluctuations, I'm not worried at all. I believe Bitcoin will only increase in value in the long run and even if I'm wrong and it drops to nothing, I'm not going to invest more than I can afford, so the risk will be minimal. I'm just having fun with it.
