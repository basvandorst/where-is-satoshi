You'd have to be an idiot to tax crypto to crypto trades that are done on exchanges in China. I only tax my USD cash outs that I do on coinbase.

Funny you call yourself an economist but you can't see what's coming for Bitcoin. Hint: it's going to be a lot bigger than you think. I used to call Bitcoin buttcoin or Grandpa coin or whatever but fact of the matter is Bitcoin will become very valuable and it will be the catalyst to a new global currency. Why do you think big institutions want in?

Lol nice calling Rogers site a scam. But it is, just like Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2019-03-20 16:29:00
One USD is equivalent to like .0001 btc. Proof that USD really is toilet paper

Hahahaha I love this. Jihan's day of reckoning is coming. Roger's too. You live big and brash you crash hard and fast. Will be good to see these 2 assholes penniless and without a Bitcoin to their name.

Just like the Bitcoin logo by itself with nothing else. If you put that on a black t-shirt that has a high collar (not the cheap ones with low collar) I will buy it. I said not paying Roger because currently you can only get that on bitcoin.com or pay for a cheap Chinese one on a sketchy website

Probably a good call to hold btc and ltc 
@_date: 2019-03-16 07:07:40
if its a serious emergency then a dip isnt going to stop me from selling. i wish i could dump all my usd into it but even though i think and know the usd is worthless it still needs to be used to survive comfortably so im like basically 75% btc 25% usd at this point and probably going to keep that ratio
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:48:43
Yes as long as you have the seed phrase you're set. The seed is the most important for a recovery
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:02:09
Exactly why I'm loading up as much fiat as possible in btc. Only keeping enough to pay living expenses the rest goes to btc
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:15:31
Hahahahaha you have no fucking idea do you? Fidelity is dumping 5% of their fucking portfolio into crypto and no they aren't buying your shitcoins they're buying btc. And then the reward halving that's happening next year? Lmao near zero? That's the dumbest shit I've read in a while 
@_date: 2019-03-20 16:16:37
I just want Bitcoin logo t-shirt without paying Roger for it.
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:07:41
Btc and eth definitely
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:19:36
Unironically stay poor if you aren't in right now. You're in before financial institutions because theyre tied up by regulations. You can beat the elite to this one for once
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:32:55
Then I'll sell

its funny that the "rize cronic" guy is putting down people who use it to buy drugs and most likely buys drugs illegally just not on deepweb. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:46:53
That's how big money flows in.....
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:00:52
Exactly this. Everyone down votes me or calls me a brain let but the fact of the matter is btc is going to 6 figures 
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:58:40
If you believe in the future of Bitcoin it should be a very easy buy.

Wells Fargo blocked all my crypto purchases but bank of America still lets me buy crypto.

@_date: 2017-08-15 01:03:33
if it was $500 tomorrow morning i'd be buying 1 btc immediately. i have a good job and holdings in IOTA so im not too worried. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:29:48
nice. do what you can. even the smallest amounts still count

Its 11.96c/kW but my computer at 790w running 24hr a day only costs me $62 and change a month 
2x 1080 360w 1 1080ti 230w 1x e5-4650 v4 100w + HDDs/fans  
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:53:45
mining on a 1080ti+2x1080+e5-4650 v4 gives me $25 USD/day and on an initial investment of $1840 and factoring in my electricity costs ($62/mo) i would make my money back in less than 3 months. anything after that is just pure profit and i regained what i spent. I could then choose to spend the money i earn from my hardware on bitcoin market so essentially all the bitcoin i would buy would be courtesy of my computer, not courtesy of my real life job paychecks. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:49:10
thats really good to know. i guess im mining BTC right now because its a lot more valuable than ETH, but i really should diversify into ETH asap, but ill probably get a second computer running to mine ethereum.
exactly, so if segwit passes all the BTC i mined can potentially be worth an enormous amount so im not seeing how i would be losing out at all?
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:51:36
i mean theres nothing stopping anyone from buying up bitcoin before and after segwit. i mean isnt it better to be buying bitcoin out of pocket and also having a computer crunching away? you make money from 2 sources. also, if segwit does jack up the price of btc, the fact that it would decrease profitability due to the new exchange rate wouldnt really change anything...from what i understand, it would make it easier to mine blockchains as well so im not sure much, if at all, profit would be lost
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:20:07
Bitcoin..I recognize that hashrate fluctuates and isn't constant. The $25 USD/day is an average estimation from what the normal hashrate for my GPUs is right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:40:55
newegg is great for USA based consumers and also for people like me that are constantly adding more mining machines. i can outright pay for all my hardware on newegg without ever digging into my personal bank account. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:01:39
17 a day is too low. i do 15 a day with the xeon and 2 1080's by themselves. the 1080ti does 8, so actually its 23 a day which is good for ROI of 3 months. im not putting electricity cost into daily profit since i just pay monthly and can use a work paycheck to pay for it if i so wish. also, why would i miss out on the segwit surge if i already hold BTC and therefore would still benefit from the (hopefully) increased exchange rate?
to answer your second question, i'm still very new to mining, can you tell me why i should be mining ETH instead of BTC? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:33:01
right...but you were saying that segwit may make the price of BTC go up higher, so lets say BTC goes to a 5k value after segwit, wouldnt it still result in good profit even with the lower exchange rate? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:23:39
my limit is $15,000 per week on coinbase...as long as you have everything verified then you shouldnt have problems dealing in large amounts
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:12:24
thats really interesting info to know. thank you. though, i tried out the daggerhashimoto ethereum miner and on that one, im making 7.50 usd/day as opposed to 14.06 usd/day on the lbry ccminer. this is on only 2x1080 btw, im still waiting for my 1080ti to come in
at current productivity i would have a little more than .5 btc by the time segwit passes. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:27:14
thats a good point, though how long would it take to make 1 ETH? to make 1 BTC on these 3 cards it would take an estimated 6 to 7 months
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:56:45
why didnt you use the money to reinvest
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:23:36
sorry, im still new lol, but im using the nicehash client and i mostly am on the LBRY algorithm sometimes the pascal one but mostly LBRY. I just said BTC because when i mine the LBRY it tells me how much BTC i'm making. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:30:44
you make good points. i have the parts coming for a secondary rig anyway (only had to pick up a pentium g630 and 2x2gb of ripjaws) so might as well use it. ill run the 2x1080 on there and the 1080ti on another platform. I ran into temp cooling issues with the 3 gpus in a 3 stack config even after exhausting directly from the top of the gpus into ducting with fans in exhaust direction on both ends of the ducting. the bottom 2 cards stayed below 85c but the 1080ti on top kept hitting thermal shutdown no matter what. 
 
mining and buying btc with mine profits could be a way to go. 
with these 3 cards i make roughly $400 after power with the 2x1080 probably $250-$280 after power which IS still a profit...
