hah yeah that story is 100% real

You never learn about any of these people's faults in school really (or at least I didn't) so when you grow up and learn about all the shitty things they did, it can feel almost like you were lied to. Really we just need to dismantle the idea of what a historical hero is. except teddy roosevelt, that man seems to actually be an incredible exception.

when? as he was throwing out all the corrupt cops

oh nah it's overall pretty positive. he just posted a huge thread about the challenges crypto faces and that was one of the tweets taken out of context. you should go read the full thing, it's worth it:
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:17:23
he's one of the biggest players in the crypto space. you should care at least a little since what he says can impact a lot.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:06:36
given the context, nah.

lol calling eth a shitcoin is kind of hilarious considering what it can do.

@_date: 2018-04-04 03:16:22
i’ve found nothing on twitter of him supporting that shit
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:06:21
are you saying eth as a whole is a scam??
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:13:00


you keep saying this, but really provide no evidence your decision was based on anything other than your hope you'd be able to catch a falling knife...
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:06:00
many of those 'quotes' they use are largely out of context. Like that 2 year old quote from Charlie, who is supportive of Eth...
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:26:28
lol what
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:51:44
the thread is still going, he is still adding to it with examples of interactions.

it honestly sounds like you are trying to wrap your FUD into something else to make you sound smarter. what sort of TA were you doing where you thought selling that low was a good idea?

I guess Ver took a page out of Jeb!'s playbook.
