If you need this, you don't understand cryptography, blockchain, computers, and Humans.

Hey, this unexpected «bug» can clearly be turned in a feature!
This is extra strong authentication, comparable to ssh-keygen, but keypairs are generated by the wallet.
Way easier for regular user.

Next level will be an exchange without user wallet, but LN. 
Can mean no accounts at all if you follow. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:05:33
Can you provide dev infos? What are you using in backend, did you wrote the frontend?

Usd fluctuating, [usdt  (!), etc...USD crashing!
BTC kept under 4K artificially.
This broke the reverse head and shoulder and lead to confusion.
High volume peaks then low volume peaks, till peoples will realize,
That the printer is currently working hard.
BTC 15K EOY!!!

If you have time for it every day, you should maybe learn how to trade it smooth without leverage.

Very cool, but **GOlang devs**: stop being dumbs and make a real installer script:
    sudo apt-get install golang-1.11-go
    Reading state information... Done
    E: Unable to locate package golang-1.11-go
    E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'golang-1.11-go'
And not talking about the countless following path issues.
95% of all GO packages are like it: this is bad and how a lang die.
No, i won't read a full book and spend hours to learn golang ~~alienation~~ concepts, thanks.
Pretty sure half of users halted their installs because that.
What a javamind. There is **too much dependencies**, already.  This is scary.
Please **adapt to the unix philosophy**, unified parameters (--help -h ...), piping capabilities, clear man page, simple installer/uninstaller (...) so we can devs robusts packages for other langs.

« The signature would be quite large, around 11 kB »
These are some **serious** signature!
There won't be a technology able to break this for centuries to come.
Including without time limit with all imaginable ressources.
The amount of possibilities is close to [amounts of universe atoms]( (10⁸²)
**10⁸²** =  10000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
11Kb = 11000 chars in hexadecimals
**11000¹⁶** = 4.594972986357216e+64
    var universe = Math.pow(10,82)
    var signature = Math.pow(11000,26)
    console.log(
      signature,universe
    )

As a pirat, I disagree ;)

    if (B.value !== null){
      buy(low).then(sell(high));

Cryptography, all is there. This has a marvelous history, an intense present, and a glorific future. Don't reinvent the wheel! Crypto currencies are a branch of that.
That is the sole technical important things, rest is futil, after that understanding blockchains is piece of cake.

Yeah, the last line might not reflect the actual truth ;)
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:35:01
Yay. Corrected thanks.
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:13:21
Can anyone provide some useful dev resources about LN?
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:01:46
Yay! Corrected!
