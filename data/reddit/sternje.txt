What if those gains aren't realized in a transactional context?  Do I really need to advise the IRS the increase of value of any asset or property before I sell?

Bitcoin is like an orphan.  It needs adoption.  Individual, commercial, government.  Individual adoption has certainly been happening.  Commercial is in its infancy, still growing.  Governments are either disdainful or indifferent.  One will lead the other.  Stay calm and hodl on.

BBT did this a couple of weeks ago.  Wasn't a great episode, but exposure leads to adoption which leads to increased value.

Step 4.  Profit.

Best investment.  Ever.  I love btc, but I can't scratch its ears.  It doesn't run to greet me when it hears me come home.  Fuck, I'm getting misty over this pic.

Look back another few months to June '17.  $2000s. It's retained a ton of value.  The late commers and the speculators and the rest that didn't see the true value until the run up, are just butt hurt because they bought at 18000.

Guess you can call me Norm.  I don't really understand all the intricacies of crypto currency.  Idk what I'm getting myself into exactly, but it sounds like a neat idea and certainly seems the global community is going to be moving bitcoin in the right direction (up).

There's no going back to April when it was 1700.  Haha, funny now, but when it hits 25000 in Jul '18 everyone is going to be calling that man a genius.  And the grandkids will be asking for the new Transformer doll.

Sherman, set the way-back machine for 1984.  You see, back in 1984 there was a little burgeoning experiment in transferring data very quickly over any distance.  They would connect their telephone to their computer and put telephone receivers on devices that could MOdulate and DEModulate, or MODEM, signals so they could be transmitted over the POTS infrastructure (pre-cellular telephones to you and me) to another computer that was listening to it's own MODEM.  People dismissed the idea as a flight of fancy.  A playground where nerds could discuss who was the better captain, Kirk or Picard on newsgroups like alt.nerd.obsessive.  Just a few short years later fortunes were being made.  Googles, Yahoos, and stupid little bookstore called Amazon.  But here we were with this great medium with vast information and resources attached to it, but no ubiquitous method to transfer value from one person to another over it.  So here we are ladies and germs.  It's no longer the future.  It's the present.  It's happening and we're all bearing witness to it.  And it just is and will continue to be for a good long while.

He comes from a different time, a different culture and a different mindset.  And frankly, I think he feels personally threatened [financially].  He sees what's happening.  He smells the winds of change and to him they smell ill.  He reads the charts, sees the trend and summary reports and it scares the shit out of him. And he's attempting to discourage those with the deepest pockets from investing.  Because those are *his* clients and *his* institutional investors.  For now.  Little Jamie is like a dog with a bone and he doesn't want to share.
