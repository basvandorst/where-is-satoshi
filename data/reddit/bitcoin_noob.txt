I'm really struggling to see how you think QR codes are an awful user experience. You literally just hold your phone up and pay instantly. No typing, no clicking. 
How is this harder than pulling out your credit card and typing in all the details .
@_date: 2014-08-17 02:41:22
Other than the high fees and long wait times? Bitcoin is virtually free and instant.
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:24:35
Thankyou for agreeing that at this point in time, a bank account is the better option. I also receive $50ish per month interest on my savings accoint, which is risk free compared to the return I may or may not get on my bitcoin investment.

Dorian has no idea how bitcoins work. HOPEFULLY Andreas still has the private key, in the case Dorian cant figure out how to move the coins and cash out.
Theres not a more trustworthy guy in the bitcoin world to be a backup for Dorian.

Oh yea? I've never looked into it. 
Really theres nothing for conspiracy theorists to go on with bitcoin, there's just no evidence. 
The only indication to me, knowing how banks run the world, is the strange fact that the US is not trying their hardest to stop bitcoin. Very strange. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:58:33
No we can't. People believe exactly what the media tells them. And the media aint gonna report what we say, they will report what their overlords tell them to.

@_date: 2014-03-18 00:54:08
Yeah, because bitcoins been around just as long as credit cards right? Here's a tip- bitcoin is EXPERIMENTAL. If you are in a situation where you need to be able to guarantee you can pay,  either take cash,  or take some responsibility and send your bitcoins to a wallet where YOU control them,  such as Android wallet. 
Bitcoin is FAR from mature. Either understand that and stop whinging,  or go back to your bank and come back to bitcoin in 10 years when its ready for the rest of the foolish masses. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 09:58:07
If I made the same number of transactions per month with bitcoin as I made with my bank account, the fees would be more than $5 per month. So your point is kinda void. I love bitcoin, but you're making the wrong argument for it. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:44:57
This is exactly why we need bitcoin. These opressive government's dictating what we can and can't do with our money, all in the name of fighting 'terrorism'.

Well, witnessing a bitcoin tip over a year ago was the amazing thing that made me look into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 20:24:03
Then you would have those media headline that the price of bitcoin has plunged from $430 to $0.00043 or whatever it is. There would be years of smug people who had heard about the value of a bitcoin being $1200 and now being less than a cent.

Probably something that highlights the fact you can pay anyone at anytime. In new zealand at least,  paying someone via online banking from your bank to another bank takes a few hours. If you do it at midnight,  it won't go through until 9am. If you do it on midnight friday, it wont go through until 9am monday. 
One way I've seen bitcoin extremely useful is buying a car in a private car sale. I don't want to show up with $20000 in cash. I might lose it. Someone might mug me. 
The seller doesnt want a cheque. He might lose it. It might bounce. It might take a week to clear. People under 25 don't even know what a cheque is. 
What suits both parties? Bitcoin. We can pay for the car simply by negotiating an amount and scanning our phones qr code. 
No risk to either party. Money and car changes hands instantly. Doesnt matter if its midnight tuesday or midday sunday. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:38:26
So its possible to tattoo a QR code? I imagined everything would need to be super perfect and printed out by a computer to actually work.

I dont know, I'm not an economist. I think the changes to the entire system would be so overwhelming thats its a bit simplistic to say 'people wont lend therefore parents basement'.
Houses would be cheaper, for a start. People would want to amass more wealth so pretty much everything would be cheaper. Jobs would possibly disappear as shops close down. Is this a bad thing? People would have less incentive to work as if they have enough money they could live within their means and simply live off the deflation. Therefore wages would have to rise to tempt skilled people to go and work.
A world where we dont have to work like slaves! You could choose to not work and be relatively poor, or to work and be able to afford luxury items. Due to the emergence of AI, jobs will be disappearing anyway.
So, to answer the question, perhaps you wont need to borrow money at all? Imagine a world with no bankers ripping us all off. A debt free world...
Now as I say, I have no idea what I'm talking about and am talking out of my ass. But a guy can dream.

Dude....a smart guy like Satoshi, when choosing his random date for his birthday (which he knows will likely be investigated one day), he is going to choose a date significant to him.
We have a direct correlation between what happened on the chosen date and bitcoin. If you think its a coincidence, in this case, you're a moron.

@_date: 2014-04-15 05:56:34
I'm well aware of bitcoins shortcomings. In fact I see ease of online purchases as one of the only benefits over credit cards for the general public. 
If you think funding an Android wallet is hard, then you're doing it wrong. And seriously, ditch iPhone! Since the HTC One came out there is no reason to stay with Apple. Ex die hard Apple fan here. 
If you think carrying a credit card and typing in all the details is really harder than scanning a code with your phone,  well there's no way I'm gonna change your mind. Are you an older gentleman? 
As a 26 year old,  I despise that in 2014 I still need to carry a wallet with cards in it. I want to be able to do everything electronically with one device. So I find paying by android wallet, and therefore not having to carry a card wallet and look after it,  a far superior system.

I cant help but think that this is where all this is headed. If the powers that be want bitcoin destroyed, they will simply say that IS has been funding its international efforts using bitcoin.
Governments across the world have been taking away freedoms and increasing surveillance all in the name of fighting this non threat. They could very simply ban bitcoin using this excuse. They already know everything we do on the internet. Everyone with a bitcoin wallet will be added to a watchlist, have their door broken down by police, and potentially arrested.
We can only hope bitcoin skims under their radar long enough to become more widespread.

Perhaps phones need a hardware button dedicated to payments.

I can see it now…The world is in ruin. The NSA controls bitcoin and uses it to keep track of everyone's spending habits, all in the name of fighting terrorists.  Satoshi Nakamoto is 97 years old.

The real government, the deep state planners, are extremely competent. These guys are not voted out every 4 years. They stay in power for decades.

From the afternoon 17:00 to 19:00 two hours , the Bitcoin Chinese trading price JUMPED UP sharply, JUMPED UP sharply from 3691 yuan 3400 yuan , down 5% .
Stakeholders for many years in a bitcoin transaction told Sina science and technology, although the news true or false is unknown, but has quickly caused panic in the bitcoin community , many traders are prepared to sell holdings bitcoin , bitcoins domestic prices likely to RISE significantly.
Last December , the central bank has issued a " Notice of CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS prevention Bitcoin " Bitcoin for that Bitcoin is a specific DIGITAL goods , does not have legal status and monetary equivalent , can not and should not be used as currency in circulation in the market to use.
At that time the central bank requirements, financial institutions and payment institutions may not bitcoin price for the product or service , may not be sold or traded bitcoins as a central counterparty shall not be covered with bitcoin -related insurance business or insurance coverage into Bitcoin may not be directly or indirectly, to provide customers with bitcoin other related services .
But at the time the central bank made ​​it clear that in the notice , Bitcoin transaction as a commodity trading behavior on the Internet , ordinary people at CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS from the premise , with the freedom to participate . Therefore, insiders judgment, the central bank suddenly demanded an BEGINNING to the possibility of not all Bitcoin transactions . ( Nan Zhang )

Good on you all. 
Do be aware there is accusations Snowden is a 'limited hangout' - ie still working for the NSA. 
The theory being the media only shows us what the powers want us to see,  and Snowden has had A LOT of airtime. True whisleblowers like Assange and Manning and vilified in the media and find themselves facing false rape accusations. 
Look into Snowdens past and you'll find some very pro government, anti whistleblower comments on forums.

I'm exactly the same.
My mindset used to be that if I had $50 left at the end of the week then I could go and buy something awesome.
Since Bitcoin, I only buy the cheapest, budget grocery items. I buy nothing unless it is absolutely necessary for a comfortable survival. Some of the money I am saving goes to bitcoin, the rest to other investments. In less than a year I've gone from a paycheck to paycheck survivor to having tens of thousands of dollars in investments.
Deflationary currency completely changed my mindset for the better. The implications of this, if the entire world gets the same mindset, could be devastating for the corporations but extremely beneficial to the environment and the world.
