No, I'm saying as the block reward/subsidy goes down and miners become more dependant on fees will need to be balanced against users desire for affordable txs. I agree that---especially while the reward is 12.5 btc, we can afford to. and should, keep fees low and given that payment channels aren't really in place right now a block size increase would be ideal. But I lost that arguement a long time ago and now segwit is near so yeah.

I like how the most upvoted comments are from users with new accounts saying this is a terrible idea. Shows just how dumb the median user on this subreddit has become.    
You can claim capital losses on your tax return---though there is a max limit but you can use capital loss carryover  to deduct it on future returns. I have recorded gains and losses from bitcoin trading on my taxes for my last 3 or 4 returns. I have been audited zero times.        
But what do I know, I'd definitely trust someone with an account a month old when it comes to IRS audi...I mean 'IRS AUDITS' over someone that knows what phrases like "capital loss carryover" mean.    
     
   
edit:     
As pointed out, this could be deducted as loss from theft, which has no max or need for carryover. Smart thinking.

I would imagine whatever does the tabulation could have an intermediate step to encrypt or otherwise obfuscate the original voter address. That is to say, John S. has the ID/address 123aBCD and votes for X. This is relayed and whatever the mining mechanism is could record it as "XXX with a way for us (public) to verify the signature should be possible. I'm trying to think of it but its not worth the brainpower really, voter fraud is pretty rare in the modern era and is much lower of a priority than campaign finance/influence of money/et al.     
It's a good point you mention though since the secret ballot is what pretty much ended vote buying which was a rampant problem.

Could help but you would need voters that each have their own privkey. Could attach it to a driver lisc but that creates the requirement to have a DL.      
I think an interesting corrolary to this is an idea I've heard Eric Posner (son of the badass 7th circuit judge Richard Posner) put forward what he calls 'quadratic vote buying', in which each voter is allotted, say, 100 coins each election. Say they have 5 races to vote on: a state rep race, Congressional house race, presidential contest, county commissioner, and a ballot measure for a water treatment plant. Say the voter doesn't have a strong preference in the Congressional seat or in the president but is emphatic about the state rep election and the ballot measure. They can allot 51 credits to the state rep, 40 to the ballot measure, then 3 to the Pres., House seat, and county commissioner races.       
I'm not sure how good of an idea it is as I haven't thought it over too much but it sounds interesting.

I initially chortled at the headline and the notion of the appeal having a fudge-pop's chance in hell. I haven't followed the case too closely but I knew enough to know he was DPR and I personally think any "free ross" campaign is pointless as he has clearly broken the law---this isn't a wrongful conviction.      
    However I did skim through the appeal brief and was pretty surprised at just how poorly the case was prosecuted. From withholding Brady material (meaning evidence that would help defense) to gems like this from the US Attorney's reply to the initial appeal:        
 "But the fact that two agents sold information to Ulbricht, attempted to extort him, and stole money from his customers’ accounts through the Silk Road
website, itself did nothing to undermine the reliability
of the evidence found outside that website that
demonstrated that Ulbricht was “Dread Pirate Roberts,”      
   
Basically that breaks down like this...      
Defense says: "your corrupt agents bring reasonable doubt to your case and weaken the idea of this being a fair trial and that we had no mitigating factors"     
US A: "So what if our agents extorted him and stole money from SR customers? It doesn't disprove that DPR=Ross Ulbricht"       
Wut? So the gov is saying, no matter how it was discovered or whatever else happened, whoever DPR was should be getting 2 life sentences. This for the purpose of making an example out of Ulbrict as to deter others. Well how well has that worked out? Nobody is buying and selling drugs on darknet sites anymore right?     
I don't think the appeal will succeed but the real problem here isn't whether Ulbricht=DPR. He was---at least for a while. The question is what exactly is he guilty of? Some kind of drug trafficking and money laundering laws certainly but the sentence doesn't match the crime. If Ulbricht wouldn't have done these things with SR then someone else would have---and normally you can't truly and sincerely make the claim 'well someone else would have' (ie. murder, embezzlement, burglary, etc)---but with this we know someone else has and someone else will. That doesn't exonerate him by any means but mitigates much of the reasoning used for sentencing  him to double life.

I'm guessing OP is on localbitcoins or   and was buying position. Someone said they were looking to sell like 1,000 btc and OP responded. Someone then claimed to be the bfx hacker to OP during course of transaction.     
OR (more likely)      
OP knows someone that claims to have been in the position described above---buying btc from the hacker--- and OP is trying to cajole the person into reporting it (but the person OP knows is resisting because they are full of shit).

The rate of transactions per second is cyclical---it ebbs and flows. If there is a backlog in the memory pool then I'm willing to bet it is most likely a Monday, Tues, or Wed. If it is totally empty then it is likely Saturday or Sunday.     
As for the blocks not being full I'm not sure what timeframe you are looking at---maybe only a few hours?--the average block size is within a few % of june and july averages. It's actually up compared to july.     
If you sum the data size for all blocks every two hours (i.e. 8/11 00:00 to 01:59 = X mb, 02:00 to 03:59 = y mb, etc)     
Mean 2hr blocksize total for:    
**2015**     
Aug - 5.71mb    
Sept- 6.86mb     
Oct - 6.68mb    
Nov - 7.32mb    
Dec - 8.43mb     
**2016**    
Jan -  8.71mb     
Feb  - 9.52mb    
March - 8.77mb      
April - 9.19mb       
May - 9.56mb     
June - 10.2mb     
July - 9.2mb     
Aug - 10.0mb (8/1 to 8/12)   
     
In theory 12mb is the max (6 blocks per hour * 2). Once the avg tx size is able to come down then, in theory, these numbers should go down assuming segwit implementation outpaces bitcoin adoption.

Just posted this comment on post about this (the claim that BFX employees are making more than avg. Goldman Sachs worker) so might as well crosspost here:       
       
Pretty absurd to be honest. In another post I calculated their take of fees a day or two ago in terms of USD---though I calculated it at 0.25% per btc traded (though I'm not sure if 'both sides' should be calculated). Year to date I came up with $6.9 million. However since I don't own an exchange or stand to profit from taking BFX down a notch I bothered to look up how many pageviews BFX gets and included overhead estimates. BFX gets 880,000 pageviews in the past 30 days, so their is likely some pretty heavy hosting/server fees. Then you add in any regulatory compliance costs, taxes, office space, capital goods, electricity and all that other shit you get a much different total.        
Don't get me wrong I'm not defending BFX, I've never used it and think they a pretty poorly run. But this is a steaming load of shit as far as accounting goes. At least now I know never to use bitmex either because either A) their CEO honestly has zero accounting and business skills or B) they are trying to take down a competing exchange a notch or two by attacking its employees, which is pretty damn unscrupulous.         
Thanks for the heads up to avoid your exchange though Artie.

Yes you are correct that low rates from central banks reduce it for normal people. However the nations aren't failing to deprecate the value of their fiat in fact this policy would actually reduce the money supply in a way we haven't seen before (that I can recall anyway).      
These negative rates mean that banks will be paying the central banks, and presumeably the central banks will 'delete' this money. Say a huge firm like JPee Moregum has $500bln in reserves (when they only are required to hold $50bln). If the interest rate is -0.2% JPee will have their balance reduce by $10bln by the central bank, now if they lend $100b of that $500 out then it would only be reduced by $8b.       
The low rates we've seen could help bitcoin look as a more attractive investment to prop trading houses and individual investors. But the difference between 0.25 and -0.20 doesn't really matter---especially since the U.S. rate is still positive.     
@_date: 2016-08-13 10:12:27
You aren't saying on-chain scaling is a long term solution right? Ultimately, assuming bitcoin is successful, blocks and the mempool will be *always* be full.      
A max throughput of 3.33tx per second is paltry (1MB)     
26.64 tx/sec will eventually be insufficient as well (8MB)      
Thus payment channels are going to be the only practical option. *However* this doesn't mean that blocksize shouldn't be increased. The blocksize should be set to what will maximize net social benefit---or rather, maximize net surplus for miners (seller/supply/firms) and users (buyer/demand/public). There are issues with larger blocks: slower relaying between nodes/miners, nodes having memory eaten by a full mempool that need to be taken in to consideration. However this is secondary to optimizing blocksize/fees for social benefit.     
If bitcoin is to be *the* blockchain currency of the future blocks would have to be enormous. If 0.2% of the world pop. (16 mill.) will use btc for one tx a day, we would need to handle 185 tx/sec. 8MB blocks max out at 27 tx/sec. Lets say we can handle 16MB blocks and segwit gets tx size cut in half, that's only 107 tx/sec.

My laugh came from the notion that the appeal had any meaningful chance to succeed. I do get another chortle out of you saying *"maybe he deserved 10-20 years in prison, but life? For what?"* since you clearly missed me saying:      
"gov is saying, no matter how it was discovered or what happened, whoever DPR was should be getting 2 life sentences. This for the purpose of making an example out of Ulbrict as to deter others. Well how well has that worked out? ...
**the sentence doesn't match the crime.** If Ulbricht wouldn't have done these things with SR then someone else would have..."      
       
 


     
No. That's why I said, as you quoted: "surprised at just **how poorly** the case was prosecuted." To elaborate further, "how poorly" means that I'm surprised that prosecutors and investigators, with such a high profile case and a target they've undoubtedly been dying to take down, that they fucked up as bad as they did and made little effort to fill in these holes before taking it to trial. Our judicial system is systemically unfair---it is a great friend to a very small demographic of persons but remarkably byzantine and cruel to other demographics. I can't see anything in my original comment that indicated otherwise.       
My guess is you either:     
- didn't read more than the first two lines of my comment.

I wasn't the one that made the centralize point. But, right now, the biggest problem is that the two biggest pools are closely related to one another (F2 and Ant) and on top of that (what I personally see as the bigger problem) is &gt;75% of the hashrate is in China. You seem to want larger block sizes yes? Chinese pools have little incentive to move in that direction since they relay blocks slower the larger the block. Hell having any country have &gt;75% of the hash power is bad though, the interests of miners can vary slightly from nation to nation (ex: if 75% of miners were in a nation with the fastest internet speeds they would have an incentive to push the blocksize high as possible since they could relay the blocks much faster. Or again with China, they have electricity that costs next to nothing whereas Western Europe electricity is very expensive---so these miners have totally different perspectives for mining)
@_date: 2016-08-21 07:52:35
I'll piggy-back on this comment to address negative interest rates. The negative interest rates you've heard about are more complex of a notion than people realize. This started at the central bank level so this is more relevant for huge institutional investors (commercial banks, mutual funds, investment banks) that would have reserves with a central bank. Those banks with reserves have taken to holding more than the required resv. ratio in recent years. Rather than lend they have decided it would be better to sit on the funds even if they only get 0.25%. And with QE and such they have a **ton** of reserves. Central banks don't want them making money off this instead of lending so they have cut interest rates closer and closer to zero (and for other reasons). Still little lending has happend. So central banks are now in effect telling those with reserves: "you want to sit on all this cash instead of lend? Fine by us, your new interest rate is -0.2%" Thus the reserves will now **cost** the banks money to sit on.    
 Sure some of this has trickled down a bit to large banks/mut. funds/etc. Those without reserves that would be interested in this are, in essence, looking for somewhere to park hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Generally US t-bills or bonds are where such 'parking' would happen but with bond returns so terrible and US treasuries still pay okay but no institutional firm is going to buy into only US t-bills, especially with how ~~dysfunctional~~ **un**functional the US Congress has become.... and no firm puts all their eggs in one countries basket. 
Thus these firms buy---as they always have---from other nations even if they are paying -0.2%. These firms don't pay attention to the nominal interest rate though, they consider the real interest rate. The Fisher equation gives us the real interest rate by accounting for inflation. If nation X's inflation rate is rising at 5% a year and you lend out money with a 6% interest rate, the real interest rate you receive is only 1%.     
Rather than continue this lecture I'll conclude with this. The kind of parties (with or w/o reserves at a cent. bank) interested in negative interest rates are looking for a stable place to park money, alot of money. None of these firms are going to park ten billion dollars in Bitcoin. It's way too risky and this isn't money that is being used with the intent to profit maximize, it is money that is meant to be the same (real) value in a decade.

@_date: 2016-08-11 07:55:59
Let me break it down for you since you are already to the point where you have nothing but insults (rather than hypothesis, reasons and facts) to 'advance' your argument.      
Most bitcoin holders don't have 500k in bitcoin laying around. The signature provided matches the address and message provided. Of the handful of people with that much in bitcoin, at least one of them has to be the bfx hacker, meaning there is not an unreasonable chance that the OP is the hacker.     
OP sent single bitcoins to a few users. Since you have lept to the assumption there is no possible reason for OP to do this, consider this:        
If you have &gt;100,000btc and, presumably, would like some of it in USD you are going to have a hard time converting it without raising eyebrows and eventually having to explain where the funds came from. However, if you gave 1000 to, say, 12 different addresses of users that posted, and one of the users was you, you could claim to be one of the lucky 12 people that received it. You could even give to 12 people (and none to yourself) in *hopes* to see what happens to those users from a law enforcement perspective.            
      
Anyway, I am truly curious as to what your response to this comment will be... that is whether you will:     
 a) make a rational, reason-based case against the points I just wrote---which I would, in all seriousness, applaud.       
b) dig your hole deeper with petty insults and zero claims to backup your argument to avoid the cognitive dissonance.

I'm not getting how centralization makes it that much more easy to carry out what you originally described. I mean sure, it is easier---like entering an agreement with 3 state level governments instead of 3000 municipal level govs.      
But wouldn't it be easy for BFX to create a trustless funding mechanism for the bonus reward---a smart contract/channel or as part of the reorg---and announce to the decentralized miners "hey if you do this for us we will give you 2x block rewards" and thus collectively, but individually, get to the majority of miners needed? Then each miner who works toward this on a block is rewarded.

Some data to consider. Since april 2013 bfx has taken in about $24 million in fee revenue assuming 0.25% fee on BTCUSD trades. (took integral((daily volume * close price in USD)*0.0025). $6.9 million from start of 2016.     
Traffic estimating websites say bfx has had 880,000 pageviews in past 30d. That would be 50gb of downstream traffic at 65kb a page---but I'm guessing their average is alot higher given the trading UI and trade data plus all the API queries. I could see their server/hosting fees being over 10k/month pretty easy. If they have some kind of support team that is an outsourced thing like other ticket based systems then that can be another 1k/mo. If they have a web developer or similar coder and one other IT or CS worker that is another 12k/mo. Fees to regulators, permits, taxes, etc is a few more grand, office space? hardware? electricity? there goes another grand.         
So maybe they have a few bux leftover to help ease the haircut but it likely isn't going to be much of anything. 60 million in losses isn't much different than 61 million.     
Was their fee really only 0.25%? I never used BFX so i dunno, but that seems a little low.

Disgusting. is either: writing with the intent to mislead, defame, and harm ChainAnchor, or he truly lacks a basic understanding of how Bitcoin works.     
Frankly, I never really paid mind to the users remarks about him before as I assumed they were just baseless character attacks. However he really seems to not understand bitcoin and that people can actually build on top of bitcoin---without effecting bitcoin itself.         
But maybe he does understand it and is simply being disingenuous; since he says **"Unfortunately I haven’t been able to get anyone willing to go on the record and simply say who those Bitcoin community members are publicly;**      
implying that he at least contacted ANYONE tied to the project. Yet when David Shrier replies that he and others weren't contacted by Todd, **Todd's response is: *"Where do you think I claimed that I tried to reach you for comment?"***          
At which point Shrier points out that Todd isn't responding to his e-mails to Todd. After being made aware of newer drafts that make it even more clear ChainAnchor is totally separate from bitcoin (akin to the way novacoin or another fork of bitcoin is separate) Todd has been silent. No comments here saying my bad. No new blog entry or update to the original article. 
       
Investigative journalism 101 PROTIP: if you are "exposing" someone you should ask those being exposed to comment, or at the very least ask others who have a better understanding of the topic to review your article/conclusions.    
That is unless your sole purpose is to slander someone.  Todd either has a personal animus against someone at ChainAnchor or he truly does not understand the very basics of how Bitcoin works. Perhaps the former since he has made no attempt to correct himself---or if he truly believes in what he wrote he would make an effort to refute what has said in response to his charges.

OP should also diversify his storage methods. That is keeping the btc backup up in multiple different places. Technically it increases the odds of losing some but losing some is always preferable to losing all.      
Second, OP should definitely diversify into other assets. It's easy for others here to say not to or to put it all in gold when its not their life savings at stake. I'd put some in a simple index fund like SPY (SP500 ETF priced at 1/10th SP500), physical metals are okay too but don't have to be gold---Iridium and other rare metals might not be a bad idea given their usefulness and scarcity vs gold.

Sure, but as bitcoin is a deflationary currency the value of it relative to other currencies (USD/EUR) is going to be high. So a miner getting a reward of 25btc at $300 was getting $7,500. Now---even if they were getting no subsidy---they are earning an avg of 1.81btc fees/block. Even at $5k this would be just under $10k.          
Further, miners are the only one recieving any economic surplus since their elasticity is nearly flat and even if their willingness to accept was set at the lowest tx fee on a block they are still getting the surplus of the other 1,999 or so txs.

Also, sorry to be that guy, but if you don't have the private key then the wallet isn't really "yours"

Looking at my wallet's txs from 2012 to 2016, I have over 80 btc sent to addresses that start with "1dice..." (satoshidice) and at least a few that have seals with clubs as the label.          
In fact, of sending txs only, I have over 700+ txs for 488 btc. I have less than one coin right now. My 'best' year for selling btc-&gt;USD was around $23,000. Of course I would rather have those 80+ bitcoins I wasted (or, rather, more of the $1.2million they would be worth). Sure I regret it and am not doing great financially, but getting angry or depressed about it isn't going to do any good. I hold what I can afford to and see what happens.

Yeah on a sunday. When tx volume is at its lowest. Do a tx on a wednesday and tell me how you fare. The avg fee rate for the past six months is 194 sat/byte, so a 500byte tx is just under .0010btc. Even at a third of the current price ($5000) this is $2.91/tx.       
Even if you want to call the USD value irrelevant, then fine, the fact remains that sending a .01btc 500byte tx now has a 10% tx fee.              
Also can do mind giving a link to this $0.46 cent tx? I'm curious as to what the lowest fee on the block was since you managed to get a 16 sat/byte tx on the next block (or after next)

I've used coinbase for a couple years and have transferred thousands USD in and out, sent and recieved BTC with it and have never had a problem.      
I don't use them exclusively by any means but certainly a great deal, I think they have a platform that really helps bring in the average joe that wouldn't have otherwise tried bitcoin and see that its not so scary or unsafe.        
I know they have what some see as too much regulation, spy on your addresses, want too much info, etc.  But these are to comply with federal regulations and aren't optional for a money transmitter/bank that wants to be licensed in the US.      
If you don't like that and feel bitcoin should sooner die than have companies comply or would rather people not use bitcoin at all if their going to use coinbase, etc, that's fine by me (not being facetious), I think it's good to have a spectrum of opinions on stuff like this. Just don't tell me it's wrong or imply it's immoral or be generally insulting about it. If you have a valid point or argument to raise then speak up, but if you're being an ass about it or presenting opinions as fact then I'm (and anyone else) not going to take you seriously and you just make what you advocate look bad.     
That really goes for anything though... it's just I hate to see low-brow arguing happen in the Bitcoin community, we're ~~nerds~~ 'tech enthusiasts', if anyone should be able to debate dispassionately and with logic it's us.

Nope, that's not wrong. I guess you're just not a big enough ass to tell someone how to use their money "properly"...

Thanks for helping me out. Yes two of the items are in the newegg marketplace section, I asked chat support and they confirmed this. Kind of a bummer since so much stuff on newegg is now through 3rd party sellers, I figured that the payments first passed through newegg anyway that they could have integrated this, hopefully they'll at least allow sellers to accept bitcoin soon. Bummer :/   
I do greatly appreciate the help and not just downvoting, I'm sure others will run into this issue too since newegg makes no mention of this on their "how to pay with bitcoin page" linked to the new bitcoin ads they have. Could really use an asterisk somewhere to mention this.

Its complicated since you have to hold some things constant but, real briefly, it depends on the tx/sec rate ebbs and flows. Say the the tx rate is oscillating from 3.00 tx/sec to 4.2 tx/sec with a week from trough to trough/peak to peak. Miners would make more with a 1MB limit than a 4MB limit. At 4MB the mempool wouldn't fill up much and users would have no incentive to pay more. At 1MB the max is ~3.33 tx/sec, so the pool will backup a lot _*but*_ will also clear at times. the times where it backs up there is, in a sense, a supply shortage. Users wanting confirmation in the next block will pay more and more.     
 The _*same number of txs is processed under both scenarios*_,^a since the pool will clear eventually. Backlog txs will just clear 1mb than 4mb.    
The same would likely happen sooner or later with 2mb blocks, 4mb, etc. That doesn't mean unlimited size blocks are superior, miners and the network itself would bear the burden while users reap the benefit.--- its akin to the reverse of the 1mb cap.     
    
My personal opinion is that the size limit should be decided via an optimization equation that maximizes social benefit (meaning the optimal point is where burden to users and miners is minimized and surplus maximized) via a Lagrangian or other methods used in stuff like tax optimization, carbon pricing, eliminating externalities, etc.     
       
   
       
a. If 12,000 tx/hour is the limit at 1mb and we are at 14k for 24 hours then 48k tx will be in the pool at the end of the 24hr. These tx do not vanish, but rather say for the following 24hr the rate is 10k/hour. Each hour the pool shrinks by 2k tx and after 24 hours it has cleared. So users wanted 336k tx sent on day 1 and 240k on day 2, but instead miners processed 288k on both days. The total is the same with 4mb blocks but 336k processed day 1 and 240 day 2.        
**This all (not just footnote sect.) holds alot constant and is for when the "weekend tx/sex rate" is still below 3.333tx/sec.** Things get hairier once the  norm stays above this.

This ^      
I've been around since 2011 and in those years volatility was much higher and it seemed like there was limitless possabilities and the protocol improvements were more exciting, anyone could mine, it was just different.       
Now the blocksize debate has stagnated and has made it seem like future features are impossible. Everyone has stolen the blockchain idea---which even though we knew was going to happen it still stings a bit. The community feels like it doesn't exist anymore and even the dev mailing list and IRC lack the same feel. Plus 9 out of 10 users don't understand that if bitcoin is successful, in terms of adoption, what we are seeing with the mempool now is going to be the norm---whether we have 4mb blocks or segwit (unlimited blocks would be impossible to relay and miners would soft limit and  eventually we'd likely all agree to some stupid arbitrary cap again).         
Plus, personally, I've been working on a model/paper/proposal for blocksize limit based on social benefit (think Marshallian economic surplus/Lagrangian optimization/CV EV kind of stuff) for a year now and it feels like it is never going to finished and too many people either: don't care, don't have enough economics literacy, are too burnt out on blocksize, to take in interest in my proposal.      
Bitcoin itself is really doing better than ever though.            
            
          
and I could care less about the Bitcoin ETF as it is of little relevance. Barry Silberts 'bitcoin investment trust' (see symbol GBTC ) has been around for years and tracks about as well as most ETFs and is actually backed by something. Alot of ETFs are garbage that have to reverse split constantly and track prices pretty dogshittedly from my experience. All a bitcoin ETF would be is a way for Wall st to bet on btc without having to ever touch it. I just hope it doesn't start to get backwards and effecting the actual price of bitcoin because Wall st is likely to treat it *exactly* like gold---buy/long when S&amp;P is tanking and sell/short when the market is rising.

@_date: 2017-02-14 07:27:58


Wouldnt go so far as to say that. You can get a good idea of the price elasticity for fees when mempool is backed up vs. empty. The times where the tx rate stays above 3.33tx/sec the elasticity approaches perfect inelasticity, the same would happen at 13.33 tx/sec with 4MB blocks. So it is possible to say "what range of fees will we see if the block limit is 4MB and the tx rate is *X*" and plot out a decent estimate.        
This is all miner *revenue* that I'm speaking to, not profits. I'm not in the loop anymore with miner hardware lifecycles and alike to get in to that.

"Im not sure if these rumors are true but Ive deposited 72k leaf and 73k DOGE"   
The rumors are true, you have deposited a bunch of coins. har har.   
But I'm guessing what you are implying is that you deposited some coins to cryptsy and the deposit hasn't credited yet? I've been using cryptsy since a couple of months after they launched and I've never had to wait an unusual amount of time for a deposit to show as pending once it was confirmed on the blockchain. I never got how cryptsy was a scam and i'm always surprised when i see people say it outside btc-e's trollbox. Scam implies they steal your coins and i've never had this happen or seen a legatimate case of it. There have been plenty of issues with lag in their trading engine and website over time but i've never seen anything close to a scam.

The only time I could see this thinking being remotely applicable is perhaps for a very large purchase like a house or a car where someone would actually be "unloading" a ton of btc. Otherwise it is hard to see how economies could have evolved past the barter and mercantile systems if this were true.      
Also, asking if they accept bitcoin isn't "trying to get them to take it."

Thats close to what Classic was supposed to be (and should have been IMO). I guess there hasn't been because the support isn't there...although with how contentious BU and segwit has been I wonder if that proposal---a purely HF to 2mb only---could gain traction at this point.

Help me to understand what I'm missing here. You buy one bitcoin from someone selling it for $200. the equilibrium market price rises in terms of USD to $210. All else constant, have you not gained $10 in wealth while the btc seller realizes a $10 opportunity cost?

Since when? Miners dictate protocol changes by having &gt;50% of them agree that "we all agree that *x* is part of a block and part of the protocol". Takes me back to when Classic was first starting up and there was this big effort to get Classic nodes online and exceed the number of Core nodes, which was meaningless.       
At a protocol level miners dictate what is and isn't bitcoin.         
Personally I don't think miners or users should have a greater share of power for substantial protocol changes. That is to say changes to something like blocksize limit---whether a HF or segwit--if decided by users is going to be something that maximizes consumer surplus and producer burden by minimizing fees (see BU), if decided by miners it is going to be something that maximizes producer surplus and consumer burden by maximizing fees (see doing nothing).     
I suspect there is a way to either optimize social welfare (or perhaps optimize reduction in deadweight loss) via some code that uses Lagrangian magic to set a limit that is best for all... even with the reality that, eventually, the memory pool will always be &gt;20k tx deep.

Yes, she would need to justify it and all claims, that's how the legal system works in the U.S.    
Thats why I used the words "her claim". As in, her claim to ownership, not "obligated share of", "half which should be awarded", "half that is rightfully hers". Claim, meaning that one party is seeking judgement on ownership. It is her assertion, not mine, just as if you are talking to your brother and tell him you saw a homeless person on the street today who claims to be the second coming of Jesus you aren't agreeing with the homeless person's assertion.        
Maybe you misunderstood, after "...his share of ownership. This means entitlement to revenue it generates...". Entitlement to revenue, etc is refering to/defining "share of ownership", not an assertion that she is entitled to have her claim approved.

But btc is here to stay because this 'split' can't kill bitcoin. It's Highlander rules bitches; there can be only one. Core, classic, unlimited, whatever; all are competing to be ''the'' bitcoin---not so much against each other.    
       
One will be adopted and the others not as if nothing changed. No banking holidays or business hours or service interruptions. As it should be since there will always be a need to move money long distances at low costs (whether its $20 sent from NJ to Kansas for a nickle in fees instead of a $40 western union fee, or $2,000,000 from NY to Lagos for a nickle in fees)   and there will always be a miner somewhere to move it.

Worse yet, he is oblivious that he is essentially describing it like a ponzi scheme: "the more everyone buys, the more everyone wins....unless everyone doesn't keep buying and is holding it / not using it as a currency since I just called it a fucking lottery so soon as value stops rising everyone will bail"

But that's what I'm referring to---the original graph of the mempool is misleading and I can explain why--- just please hear me out. In fact, *if you read this and aren't convinced and can prove (barring micropayment channels, etc) that this isn't happening I will send you $2.35(.00314btc)*, just leave an address with your reason.     
   Take a look either at the graph I posted which shows the tx accepted per second or the one [here on Tradeblock]( (1day or 1week view shows it more clearly). Can you agree that TxPS is steadily increasing?  Assuming so, the question then becomes at what point will the tx per second rate (or per block) be high enough to actually make the mempool backup. If the average tx size is 530 bytes and a block is 1mb then we can fit 1,886 tx into a block (1,000kb / 0.53kb). A block is found every 600 sec. so 1886/600 = 3.14 tx per second before the mempool starts to back up.      
According to tradeblock the mean TxPS for 2016 is 2.44. Looking at the graph from the link above you can see how there are these steady cycles of peaks and troughs, thats the days of the week. Now note the TxPS on the peaks... see alot of values over 3 in recent peaks? Now that isn't a problem unless we start staying above 3 for while. **This** is when the mempool backs up since the tx's can't clear. If we are at 1.66 TxPS all day, all else constant the mempool will be pretty much empty. If we are at 3.00 TxPS all day, all else constant the mempool will be pretty much empty. If we are at 3.33 TxPS per day all "' "' "' the mempool will have 19,262 tx in it.      
Knowing all this and where we are headed can you see what I mean? If I didn't do a good job explaining any parts feel free to ask for clarification.             
     
Now if you still aren't convinced and you can explain to me how this isn't going to be a regular occurrence I'm all ears---I sincerely mean that. I'm hoping Lightning or another form of micropayment channels can be implemented in time to keep it from being a real problem where low fee tx's aren't possible. Granted eventually this will happen no matter what, which isn't necessarily a bad thing so long as other secure channels exist and the fee is at a healthy equilibrium that maximizes social benefit for both parties.

Weird, late 2011 wasn't exactly a popular time for bitcoin so that is odd.     
But I don't remember if that first receive was me withdrawing from an online address or someone sending to me or what. But I remember paying some fees of .01btc, at the time that was like $0.14 so who cared? The worst is all the satoshi-dice tx's I see    
.44     
.50     
1.00       
.75    
got like 100 of them, most are like .05 but I don't even want to total the losses. I'm sure I would have spent them on something else or cashed them out though so I guess it doesn't matter. Guess it's good motivation to remind me not to gamble though lol

You know this isn't like some podcast for a tech audiance though right? They have 15 minutes to tell this story to an aggregate audiance who have, at best, heard of bitcoin and the blockchain. They explained mining and why electricity cost matters and things leading up to XT in simple terms. If it is purely technical discussion the audiance won't understand and will tune out and then Planet Money won't make a Bitcoin podcast again and most of the audiance have learned nothing.    
But if they understand this in simple terms without people tuning out then they can do future stories about it on All things considered that are more and more complex.     
It's like anything else: you can seek a compromise and move inches or you can stay put, remain pure in the name of preserving an ideal ideal.

I'm worried that we are talking past each other. I'm not saying its an issue either exactly---Fee's absolutely need to rise to support the decreasing subsidy. It's only an issue **if** fees are rising way too fast **and there is no alternative means to tx btc** and right now there isn't.    
What would you say is happening right now then as monday rolls around, the mempool is backing up with 20k tx, fee/kb rises, and the tx per sec isn't really outside it's norm for the past dozen monday's (but is enough to tip over the 3.14 mark)?        
Again I'm not exactly saying it's an issue--- but if fees are rising way too fast and segwit is no where near implemented (and segwit is only a band-aid like 2MB blocks) then we have a problem.      
Have you looked over the papers for the Lightning Network or Duplex Micropayment Channels (or some of the other academic examinations on Cornell's arXiv.org?) You genuinely seem interested in evidence-based approaches backed up by data so I'm curious as to what your basis is that we aren't close enough to the point of "overflowing"? How are we getting such different conclusions from the same numbers?       
I think our only real point of disagreement is over whether or not this is a problem happening in the next month or two (me) or the next year when segwit/LN/DMPC is in place to take some of the pressure off (you), would you agree with this?       
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:56:47
I'm not advocating for any one solution here--- but what happens when the tx per second rate does go over 3.33, and say doesn't drop until the weekends? I mean I know what happens, mempool fills and fees rise. But in terms of fees, how can we determine what is maximizing net social benefit [(that is, maxes producer+consumer surpluses) + (minimizes P+C cost)].        
Say the tx rate is averaging 6.00 tx per second most of the week so the mempool is crazy full (3600 tx/block demand) and using the above categories: low-prority costs $0.10, economical is $0.90, normal is $2, priority is $10. (Granted this example is extreme but I think it makes it easier to see what I'm asking). So miners are getting 0.013 per tx in fees and are ending up with a block reward of 12.5btc and fees of 25btc and consumers seem to be bearing all the net cost while producer's reap the surplus. What then? Is that just how it is and people start going to third parties requiring trust who can move it around for cheaper (given the lucrative market) or will micropayment channels be able to fix this to the point that consumers wouldn't seek a trusted third-party? or is there something else all together?        
I'm sincerely asking from an economics perspective. Bigger blocks, segwit, and alike are all temporary fixes so can micropayment channels/lightning do it and be usable in time? and do we just disregard net social benefit? (since adjusting tx capacity of blocks will greatly change social benefit) I don't know, though I think it could be ascertained once we do get the pool filled, I've modeled it but without a full pool too many assumptions have to be made. I'm hoping with the data from March and the past few days I'll have enough to go on.     
Anyways, given the length of my question I do sincerely appreciate any input/answer you care to provide.

Okay now I see how you're viewing it I think. Try this, step back and take a longer view though: [This chart]( I know its hard to see but you can verify it on statoshi.info---is from about Feb 2015 to now, daily tx per second rate, 14MA. We are starting to crest over 3.00 txps. If you switch back to the oringal white and red chart I made it shows the daily with no smoothing and you can see that monday/tuesday tx rate peaks and sat/sunday it bottoms out.       
It's like a river hitting flood stage, if the flood point is 31 feet we can be at 3 feet or 30 feet and not notice the difference, but once it is over 31, everyone's pool will be getting filled.     
I'm not saying whether its a bad thing or not, just that it is starting, that it will be most noticable on monday-wednesday, and its inevitable (regardless of blocksize/segwit/etc). That's why we need some sort of channels to divert these waters....mebbe some sort of micropayment channels?      
Also a useful metric for "seeing" actual spam attacks is to goto tradeblock and turn on "xbx price", set to 6h and don't make it too smooth and you can see where the price jumps match with tx rate jumps and where tx rate jumps *don't* match. Check out september last year. Granted the scales aren't pegged but you can see it.

Amazing how many new users here bought at a dollar or less than a penny per btc....      
I bought my first bitcoins in Spring 2011. My oldest accessible address is from June 2011 and I've moved (at current price) $144k that one alone and have---just on my PC wallet---sent almost $500k. All total, I'd say I've moved around 1,200-1,500 btc ($840k to around $1m).          
I have not much at all to show for it but it provided me with a car, very expensive dental work, and other smaller things. Of all that coin that moved through I'd be surprised if I cashed out more than $50k in lifetime profits and I currently only have about 1-1.5 btc spread around.       
 I used to get mad that I didn't buy more when the price was hitting $200 for the first time (same with the crash from $30). After so many ups and downs I guess I just got over it. Focusing on what could have been is a waste of time, plus you can't think in terms of "if I sold at peak" only one (or a few) people sell at the peak. After all these years: I'm still more excited about bitcoin's potential and mechanics than making money off it.      
And (I'm guessing unlike many other people replying) I can actually sign messages from an address that's 5 years old:

Not quite. Institutions wouldn't be offering negative yield instruments if someone wasn't buying. Large firms are sitting on alot of cash still and want somewhere to park it. With inflation so flat they don't see alot of risk opting for negative yield holdings (risk in terms of Fisher equation). That is who is buying these for the most part. The yield on gov bonds hasn't been so great and large institutions don't want to dump everything into U.S. T-bills, so where can you park your cash that is safe? China? EU? Canada? Not alot of "safe" options as far as places to spread cash out.      
Bitcoin is way too volatile for this kind of institutional function, even the lowest beta blue-chip stock would be. So what is the driver of the rise? Primarily China. Their economy is on the edge along with a currency that is subject to regular devaluation by their govt. Further, their consumer banking sector is pretty messy and doesn't offer the same kind of stable saving/investment accounts in Western nations so what are consumers to do? The SSE is still in rough shape with stocks not yielding so that's out.       
So to recap, roughly *1 in 6 people on the planet* are facing a currency that will lose value, little in the way of bank savings accounts/instruments, a flat at best stock market, and an economy entering a slowdown. Wouldn't you be more apt to increase your BTC holdings if you were in their place? This is why during the most recent run-ups the prices on CNY exchanges were consistently trading higher than U.S. exchanges---at times BTC-CN was trading at like $580 when bitfinx/stamp were still at $530.

I saw some of your post on the mailing list and it is an interesting idea---the pass fees to next block concept. Maybe I missed it or am misunderstanding but with how centralized mining my concern would be large pools passing fees to themselves (or other large pools) and wouldn't this incentivize miners to restrict the size and keep marginal fees high?

About a third of their revenue comes from individual donations but it is true that the average NPR listener makes more than the national average (around $95k household, about 50% over US average) and something like two thirds have a bachelors or higher and I think the US average has slipped below a quarter. In some ways it is a positive feedback loop: people with a college education are more likely to turn to NPR (than say Fox News), so they have more disposable income so they are more likely to donate.           
    
However you are missing one key point: they are not controlled by the establishment or the super-wealthy (they want you to think that though) Tom and Ray Magliozzi control all of it. They pretend to host a show answering caller questions about their car problems but that's just a cover. They actually both have PhD's from MIT. This is how they were able to implant sound frequencies that render the listener under their power (why else would so many people give NPR money?).      
and... I shouldn't post this here but the truth needs to be told. They are actually Satoshi. Fellow MIT alum Gavin was their puppet. Think about it. MIT now gives $100 in bitcoin to every student and plenty of bitcoin code contributors are from MIT. It's no coincidence.

Lot of people here with knowledge that doesn't stretch further than two weeks back it seems... Usage peaks on Monday/Tuesday, then when more than 2000 tx's are sent per block the mempool backs up. We are at a point where the peaks are getting higher and higher so you will see more and more backup. Sat/Sun are always the lowest volume days and we might only see (lately) demand for 1,000 tx per block. The mempool doesn't fill up until we go over around &gt;1800 tx per block. Again, **the mempool doesn't fill up until we are over 3 tx per sec for a few blocks**       
     
I should have overlayed the mempool history with this but this graph I just made, using data from statoshi.info (tx accepted per second) is set so that the verticle gridlines are drawn every tuesday. If you still doubt that sundays are the troughs I can draw one with it set to draw each sunday. [Tx accepted per second- gridlines every tues]( The black line is simply a 14 day moving average to illustrate that the TxAPS is approaching over 3. Meaning the mempool will be full more often, eventually every week with drawdowns during the weekend, until the weekend rate breaks 3 TxAPS (unless: segwit is deployed and implemented, lightning/micropayment channels is "" "" "", other solution is "" "" "")

Not sure what you are referring to...  I said alot of people seem to have knowledge that doesn't stretch back further than two weeks because of the original two-week graph.

But look at the tx/sec rate weekly view on trade block.         
Don't dismiss an argument without assessing the evidence, I beg of you. Looking at the weekly tx/sec rate on tradeblock I picked a random week at 6 month intervals (you can see for yourself that it's not cherry picked)      
Here's the tx/sec rate:      
dec '12 -.453   
jun '13 -.527 +16%    
dec '13 -.636 +21%    
jun '14 -.702 +10%     
dec '14 -.932 +33%    
jun '15 -1.31 +41%    
dec '15 -1.84 +40%    
jun '16 -2.65 +44%    
    
Even if it stops increasing at an increasing rate and only increases by 30% by dec 2016 that is 3.44 tx/sec. Surely you are not saying that this is all spam and bitcoin adoption hasn't increased at all? These are weekly averages so any spam is getting smoothed out.     
Again, a block is about 1,000,000 bytes assuming no empties or wasted space, the avg tx size is 530 bytes--- so 1866 tx fit in a block. A block is made every 600 sec roughly. So 1866tx/600 = 3.14 tx/sec max. When this rate is exceeded the mempool fills up. Yes spam has filled the pool at times, however the pool is going to be full very soon and, **again, I'm not saying this is bad or good it just is.**      
There are people much smarter than me that point out this problem and are proposing solutions: Poon and Dryja's [Lightning Network]( or Decker and Wattenhofer's [Duplex Micropayment Channels]( outline solutions. 2MB blocks, segwit will only buy time they are temporary.        
Please tell me specifically what you disagree with: the tx/s maximum capacity, the increase in tx/s being a result of increased bitcoin adoption (I have other stats to prove bitcoin is being used more widely), that the mempool will fill up when actual tx/s &gt; max tx/s.      
I'm just trying to understand where you are coming from. Are you saying that most tx are spam attacks? We can exclude data from all of june and march 2016 if that would better prove it.       
May 25 Wed - 3.30    
May 17 Tue - 3.04    
May 11 Wed - 3.03      
May 04 Wed - 3.14
the 6hr tx/s chart shows the progression.

Well that was hyperbole to a degree; I said 1 in 6 since that China's population is ~17.5% of Earth.     
But obviously the relevant population in this case are those in the middle class (or close to it) that consumer saving accounts would be relevant to them---those with savings they want to keep somewhere that isn't their mattress.

-users with an account &lt;3 months old w/ poor understanding of bitcoin/markets (15%)    
-established users that have a poor understanding of bitcoin/markets (30%)      
-paid shills  ~~(10%)~~ (2%)   
-paid shills that are actually bots  (10%)     
-established users that have an excellent understanding of bitcoin/markets but purposefully mislead those with a poor understanding of bitcoin/markets (5%)    
-users w/ an account that is less than &lt; 3 months old but have a reasonable understanding of bitcoin/markets but I and others ignore reflexively (5%)
             
     
And isn't much better, replace the 'new' and 'shills' user categories with users that are willfully blind and its much the same.

 In 2013 this sub grew about 5.5x, adding ~215 new subscribers a day.     
 Even in 2014 this sub added ~160 new subscribers a day.       
First half of 2015: 110 new readers/day (12/23/14 to 5/22/15).      
Now in the past year (11/23/15 to 6/16/16) this sub has added only 24 new readers a day.

The price of gold is inversely related to the price of S&amp;P 500. All technicals and data suggest we are in a remarkably similar situation as 10 years ago---an overvalued market running on hopium and a stunning amount of traders failing to recognize what is actually going on beyond their bubble.

In responding to your comment I was surprised at how much the Chinese banking sector has improved in the past few years. Looks like they finally implemented deposit insurance (up to about ~80,000USD) last year and are, in some ways, diverging from the Postal Bank system that mired Japan for decades.     
I've only skimmed through this thus far and it's still a bit dated but it seems to give a good overview: [link](     
Still, even with the improvements China's deposit interest rate the last decade has been terrible even with the growth. The banks---and this is based on my knowledge that is outdated by about 5 years---primary function is to lend to state-owned enterprises (directed credit) which fills their balance sheets up with non-performing loans; this is while the average Ji Sixpak makes his deposit and the funds from it are used by the government to prop up SOE and entities that the gov views favorably. Consumer deposits exist to aid in directed credit and earning interest for consumers isn't really a priority.           
But it does look like things are improving over there---that is in terms of how the banks function I mean.

I follow you, I agree on your last point but it's the first one I'm not sure on. I think we might just be ultimately talking about, basically, two different accounting methods. I agree that your $10 gain does not mean that I only gained $90 instead of $100. But doesn't it mean that, by selling to you, I gained only $100 instead of $110? and that $10 gain went to you instead? If not for our trade, I would have $10 more wealth and you would have $10 less. Thus my loss becomes your gain.      
I'm going to assume that you mostly agree with this, its just that you are saying you wouldn't count the opp. cost? In other words that the only thing that matters is the individual start and exit positions... not the macro view? Right?      
I'm not sure that either position is correct/incorrect, depends on what you are trying to account for. I still don't think the OP is wrong, I wouldn't frame it the same way as him, but I can't see how it isn't zero sum in terms of currency.        
I'm still open to seeing it otherwise though so feel free to let me know if I misunderstood or am still missing something.

Don't have a better chart handy with pegged axises (axii?) but you can see the correlation. Sure it's not close to 1.0 but there certainly is a positive correlation there, if I weren't so lazy I'd put it into excel now. I think what is really interesting though is if you take a look at the price jumps in July, Nov, and Dec of last year you can clearly see the tx rate jump with it but for sept there is no price jump, suggesting that it is likely spam (or some other use that isn't the transfer of value)

The USD is finally cooling off a little but some of the margins that the currencies beat USD by are insignificant and a singular date doesn't give alot of context I could say:      
     
Since 1 Jan 2013, the USD has beaten JPY by 19%(86Y), Gold by 25% ($1665), Ice. Kroner by 1.2% (123IK), Shekel by 1.7%, and CHF by 5%(0.925CHF)      
Maybe do YOY performance over a decade or something? I mean it all depends on what you are actually trying to measure. But I think you already know all this since you don't have a username like that and your own domain with spreadsheets laid out nice and have an incomplete view of currency markets--- I see your shenanigans!

While its true that some creditors are placed higher than others during bankruptcy (think secured vs unsecured), among users seeking relief the losses should be split equitably. Losses among users are likely to be measured in USD value at time of insolvancy---but since this is certainly a special case where values became distorted it's hard to say how the judge/reciever works out valuation. Regardless, the haircut among user accounts should be an equal proportion as users should all be on equal footing in terms of creditor priority.        
Should be interesting to see how things develop as more claimants come forward. Looks like the losses were as bad as it seemed. Still wonder what happened to that---what was it $600m worth of btc?

If you had your coins on a chinese exchange and knew the PBOC said they are going to investigate exchanges in a week---and know that the gov there can easily take unilateral actions that leave you little recourse--- what would you do?         
You would sell sell sell and get your money off there (not sure how many in China have actual wallets to w/d to or if everyone just holds at exchanges). This causes the price of Chinese exchanges to be significantly lower than others---especially notable because the Chinese exchanges tend to be a little higher overall than USD so the drop is even more significant. As I type this USD exchanges are down 25%-30% from peak and CNY exchanges are down just over 40%

Good analysis, and nice neutral wording and dispassionate points. However, I'm not convinced it is due to a spam attack (or at least primarily due). If you check out the sum tx count at 2hr, 4hr, 6hr, etc you can see how the tx rate ebbs and flows with troughs on the weekend and peaks around tuesday -/+ a day---in recent months often you can see peaks at right around the 200 tx/min mark where if it crosses 2000 tx/block (3.333 tx/sec, 200tx/min) it is not sustained so the mempool doesn't fill much. Then you see peaks that occur where expected, **but do** cross the 200tx/min threshold for a sustained amount of time then things quickly escalate.     
   
From a post I made a month or two ago:     
Here is an example scenario where the mempool could fill quite naturally.      
**time**|**tx/sec**|**pool backlog chng**|**total backlog**
12pm| 3.1 |no backlog| 0
01pm| 3.3 |no backlog| 0
02pm| 3.5 |+600tx|600
03pm| 3.8 |+1680tx|2280 
04pm| 4.0 |+2400tx|4680
05pm| 4.3 |+3480tx|8160
06pm| 4.5 |+4200tx|12360
07pm| 4.8 |+5280tx|17640
08pm| 4.5 |+4200tx|21840
09pm| 4.2 |+3120tx|24960
10pm| 4.0 |+2400tx|27360
11pm| 3.33|+0|27360
12am| 3.0 |-1200tx|26160
01am| 2.8 |-1920tx|24240
02am| 2.6 |-2640tx|21600    
and then it steadily clears.

addendum:    
when I first skimmed through I thought you were referring to different metrics but as I browsed through my datastream I see I misread. Yes these are some very large txs. Tx size does tend to ebb and flow as it seems like (as jtoomin touched on above) people seem to do 'sweep' txs on a weekly basis. However these are a good bit outside that expected range, but it is the end of the month and if you [take a look]( at when the highest peaks occur for tx size you'll note alot of spikes on last day/first day of months.        
These ones are definitely a good bit larger than previous months though but it would be a stretch to call it an attack, unless whoever is carrying out the attack is really half assing it. If I had to take a wild, pure speculatory guess, I would say it is from Chinese exchanges doing extra housekeeping after their visit from PBOC regulators (something akin to increased reserve ratio requirements? something related to settling thousands of option contracts? beats me.)

Spot on but I hesitate to call it a scaling solution exactly. Ultimately, when modeling this out, it doesn't take long to realize that there is always going to be tx's in the mempool---txs not just for clearing on the next block, *but the block after*.  So if you accept that full blocks are going to be a constant the next question is "then what?"      
    
The next logical question if we accept that thousands of txs are going to be in the mempool waiting then the next logical most pressing issue is fees (as it maximizes the utility and usability of bitcoin). Rather than asking "what's fair?" we need to ask "what maximizes benefit for both parties?"(which happens to be a good way to define fair as well!)       
Well shit we can use calculus to figure that out, and it is hard to argue over calculus. The debate after that turns back to the technical/programers are of expertise---i.e. if the Marshall cons. surplus model determines the most beneficial block limits are at 400mb, then at 4mb and below, then 32mb the programmers can determine (say) 400mb won't work but 4mb can so lets work toward that.      
    
Basically. If bitcoin becomes widespread, blocks will always be full and the mempool overflowing (I imagine zero-fee would have to die then right?). So whats equitable in terms of what miners get and what users pay? Well that can be modeled and figured out with economics so lets build the model!

Wow. Just wow. Look at a graph of the # of tx's or tx per second and you can see it isn't spam. This is what happens when the network capacity maxes out. [This Graph]( shows what spam looks like: note in Sept/October last year where the tx accepted per second rate spikes and the mempool fills. However if you note the overall trend, the tx accept rate is pushing beyond 3.33 (which is the max at 1mb blocks), so the mempool begins to backup more and more. Every monday/tuesday the network peaks a little higher and a littler higher. If you zoom in to the past six months you can see what happend in march when the tx rate went &gt;3.33.      
**This is not a denial of service attack in any way** but rather the direction Bitcoin is headed in. Don't like it? Tough shit. You can: Use a different coin, try to get the protocol changed, or just pay the higher tx fees.     
Plus, large price changes = coins moving around.        
I'd prefer 2MB blocks until we can get Lightning (or a similar solution) implemented but I'm honest about it. Don't spread this kind of BS.

Why is that post citing nonstandard rejections as being highly abnormal? The chart they show for it only has like 48 hours, pull it back to 60 days and you'll see it spikes frequently. Further, you are likely to see spikes of this nature anytime the mempool backs up (if users creating chained txs don't anticipate mempool backlog)
More importantly, these 17 output txs weren't exactly the only tx in town during this time. 200tx/hr is only .05tx/sec and as the author notes: *"This difference is the direct cause for at least an extra 5 to 6MB of transaction data processed during the congestion period."*     
This isn't an insignificant amount certainly, but you can't just disregard the other 20mb, 30mb, 40mb of mempool during this period. Without these 17'ers we would still witness a backlog peaking at 40mb instead of 45mb. Correlation != causation (though it certainly contributed)

Pretty much. People seem to be oblivious to what the IRS is actually like. Their budget has basically been flat for a decade and their audit rates have been dipping year after year. Plus when you look at the distrubition of audits, it is pretty apparent that their focus is on entities with alot of income reported. And finally, the data shows that on average the IRS accepts about half of what is actually owed.    
Even if you did get audited because you had $50k you paid no tax on, you can still amend your previous returns to account for capital losses and use carry over to offset and alike. Sorry but if you are in the US and bought 100btc for $1000 and cashed out for $80,000 a year+ later, and paid no taxes on it then you should be paying up something.

Wait, you actually don't think this happens?               
Look at the peaks and troughs for tx rate:                  
  
Doesn't take long to notice that virtually every trough occurs on a sat/sun and nearly every single tx rate peak is +/-2 days from a wednesday. Go look at the times the mempool has backlogged as well, you don't see mempool backlogs *continue* to grow on weekends--- if there is a backlog for a while and we hit a saturday you'll notice it tends to clear it up.

Not only is the whole Assange disappearance thing of concern but why the hell would anyone give money to an organization like wikileaks unless you live in 2011? They have long become less than neutral with regard to what content is released. Rather than a wiki-like site where whistleblowers can publish documents without suppression/redaction, they are clearly pushing an agenda.      
  They redacted details regarding ~$2.5b in transfers between Syria and Russia in the 'Syrian files' from 2012. Until recently the wikileaks shop had a bunch of merch that was anti-hillarly clinton yet no anti-Trump shit.   
 And it's not they released shit damaging to Clinton that is a problem here---its that they had at least some communication with the Trump campaign, their tweets are all super-partisan and misleading, they didn't release all the DNC/HRC docs at once, they sat on them and portioned them out before the election.

But really though, your comment is spot on. Bitcoin in of itself isn't "meant" for any one class or type of person. "Bitcoiners'' are people and people are fallible and will always take sides and be political (to varying degrees), bitcoin is like the internet---it is what people make of it. Not the other way around.
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:58:42
Personally, I advocated for the 2MB route when this whole schism started with XT, before segwit was concieved. Long as 2MB passed muster on the testnet, why not? However with segwit here I'm not going to be a bitter prick and reject it outright. Long as it passes muster on the testnet and doesn't complicate the future then I'm all for it.             
   
To your question though, 1.1mb won't happen. Forking to 1.1mb is more or less the same as forking to 2mb (maybe some slight differences in latency and perhaps how miners set min fee). I fear we are approaching a situation where there isn't enough consensus for 2mb or segwit to activate.           
If we are being frank about the long term however we need to come to grips with the reality that, as(/if) bitcoin usage spreads, the mempool will always be overflowing. If 0.5% of the world wants to use bitcoin for a tx just twice a week we would be looking at &gt;115tx per sec (about 35mb blocks). Even with payment channels off the ground there will be enough on-chain demand to make current mempool look empty.             
So we need to figure out what parameters maximize benefit to both users and miners within the realm of technical feasibility.

I've been working on this model for a while so this text is slightly dated and the model is a more simplified version so the average reader can understand.    
 But I still have been and intend on fleshing out this model better, so if you also have a background in economics have been doing the same kind of Marshallian Surplus/social benefit model to create a blocksize limit optimization formula, or your interested in contributing feel free to comment or PM me.
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:31:16


     
Well, at least I knew from the start of your comment you loathe economics. I still hope you will entertain my response in kind as I did.
    
I'd like to remind you in case you missed my comment that this *"model is a more simplified version so the average reader can understand"*.    
   
1. Right, which is why I said I support segwit. Average tx size is held constant in the model you are looking at. S2 can be gains through other means---which, again, is why I support segwit. Anything that maximizes consumer and producer surplus within technical feasibility is dolomite baby.       
    
2. I can correct you and not insult you in the process. Cost is held aggregate as a constant, I could have modeled it with 30 graphs to illustrate cost changes but people would have tuned out. In the model you are looking at perfect inelasticity since if we take the filled mempool as a constant given the decent block subsidy in the next decade it is more practical for this discussion. (so quadratic isn't far off---one way or another we're gonna have to^raise-that-bitch for our *x* to model elasticity)         
    
3. Yeah. Thanks for explaining to me what an externality is. Your talking more about (im)perfect competition but I'm aware of the miner size concerns, constants would need to be set with this in mind. You can find externalities modeled in upper level economics; something that is also great for solving externalities.    
     
If you want to properly approach the problem as a programmer you will ~~need to be a computer programmer first~~ also need economists. I think a lot of people underestimate Core dev's expertise in economics (which a lot of it actually based on common sense). *(those I agree with)* But the less common sense economics is what I am suggesting.

Also worth noting: that day (11/23) also had 164 blocks. Normally we average 149 blocks/day, so at 500 bytes a tx and 990kb a block we max out at 298,000 tx a day so this day was about as full as you can get.

To be frank, that's why I added the qualifier "doesn't complicate the future."... I wouldn't have even added that reply if I didn't feel the need to cover my ass to make it clear that I don't blindly support any one "side".     
I wish I would have reworded a bit and said "I'm not going to reject segwit outright simply because I'm a bitter prick"---**not** that anyone rejecting segwit is a prick. Just that too many people reject it not out of merit but out of spite and bitterness; out of emotion rather than logic.      
I still see segwit as a complicated solution to a simple problem, but for now, all other capcity increases are essentially 'off the table' and segwit contains alot of capacity-unrelated riders (in the legislative sense) that make rejecting it difficult.        
         
I still haven't thoroughly read up on the future implications with regard to segwit and it's effects. The deeper you get involved with bitcoin the more it reminds you of being addicted to eating heroin coated thumbtacks. I figure I'll get around to the 3 course meal of SW future implications over the holidays.

[Here is hourly data from around that time]( I don't have the mempool data handy on the same spreadsheet, but as you can see its not like the actual txrate is up 10x, its just that it crossed the capacity long enough to fill the pool (along with the other factors discussed earlier)

Pretty big deal. Scope of the warrant is pretty damn massive given it basically includes anyone in US that tx'd money in/out of Coinbase. Would guess that the IRS is going to check all users who have above $x in total transfers (btc&lt;-&gt;USD) between the dates and then crosscheck the individual filings for those years.    
       
I actually paid capital gains tax on sells via Coinbase from the dates in anticipation of this scenario so I hope I don't get hassled.

Yeah, especially in this (or any) subreddit, the zero-sum thinking of people is horrifying. I thought it would take years for the Bitcoin community to become so weighted with those that willfully ignore fact based points of view/science in general basically. When the "split" started, when XT came out, I was in favor of raising the limit initially but I'm open to other alternatives. If we can achieve the same effect via shrinking tx size, someone is willing to code it, and it passes muster on the test then I'm certainly not going to oppose that. By the same token I'm not going to reject an increased limit out of hand and would only do so if the risks/costs outweigh the benefits. It's the same with any proposed change really; I just don't know what the hell happened with this issue that so many people decided to stop acting rationally and decided to interject themselves as a rabid partisan and expert when they have no interest in any other part of bitcoin and potential changes.

Not to be flippant, but you don't. All you linked was a graph of the mempool tx history. Please consider skimming the first half of any of the academic papers in my OP.         
   
Also since you are using tradeblock:           
* Switch the setting from tx to 'tx/sec' and note the lack of abnormalities - a spammer would show up as a sustained spike.     
* Switch to 'value', note the 3-4 fold increase - a spammer would have to be moving around &gt;$75,000,000 in btc for the purpose of spamming, rather than small amounts which makes more sense.    
* Switch to 'fee/size', note the jump from 0.0001 btc/tx (20sat) to 0.00025 btc/tx (50sat) - that means the spammer, rather than use the min effective fee to drive up the mempool, is using a higher than required fee to drive up the mempool at a cost of thousands of dollars.

This sub is pretty horrible, its picked up &lt;10k new sub'ers since nov---about 1.5%/30days. Last time price went this high it picked up 20k sub'ers a month---about 35%/30days.          
And just to put it out there----I think r/btc is pretty bag-o-turds like as well.

Sorry, I wish I would have read and responded to yours first since by the time I started on yours I was a bit agitated by the previous commentors, apologies for the automatic defensiveness. However I do think you seem to be a bit dismissive of economics and its usefulness here.     
    
The problem with how I had to approach this post is that if it is overly technical from the start so many people will just tune out here. My hope was to: A) get a response from educated/dispassionate commentors who might not necessarily have an education in economics beyond an intro level to (ideally) be convinced that this sort of thing can be modeled, and B) get a response from others with a background in economics that will see where I am going with this.      
To better illustrate where I'm coming from overall with this I'd add---and sorry to quote myself from [another comment]( next logical question if we accept that thousands of txs are going to be in the mempool waiting...is fees (as it maximizes the utility and usability of bitcoin). Rather than asking "what's fair?" we need to ask "what maximizes benefit for both parties?"(which happens to be a good way to define 'fair' as well!)     
Well shit we can use calculus to figure that out, and it is hard to argue over calculus. *The debate after that turns back to the technical/programmers are of expertise---i.e. if the Marshall cons. surplus model determines the most beneficial block limits are at 400mb, then at 4mb and below, then 32mb the programmers can determine (say) 400mb won't work but 4mb can so lets work toward that.*"      
I want to emphasize that, in my idealistic mind, it would economists and CS guys checking and balancing each other. Like, personally, I wouldn't flesh out this model without tabbing over to  for feedback on constructing my constants. Anyone modeling this economically would need to have the CS end defining what the parameters of whats possible for the model to be useful. I'll gladly PM you as this progresses if you would like, the more econ/CS/CE eyes the better.      
..and btw, since you mentioned Keynesian econ, the model I'm proposing to use comes from [Alfred Marshall]( the founder of neoclassical economics ;)

Meh. Why would I goto WaPo for Bitcoin news? I don't goto Cat Fancy for the latest Android news.    
Plus they aren't really pro- or anti-bitcoin. [Yes Bitcoin is volatile. But it's still got defenders](        
[Why didn't Bitcoin users freak out in May?](        
[Bitcoin refuses to flip: Virtual currency stays strong despite bankruptcies, gyrating rates](      
and then an article that was an interview with Marc Andreessen on a range of subjects the headline they went with was: [Marc Andreessen: In 20 years, we’ll talk about Bitcoin like we talk about the Internet today](            
        
Maybe your guys problem isn't so much with WaPo but with Vivek Wadhwa?     
 The one caveat to this worth highlighting but nobody here seems to have picked up on is that Jeff Bezos owns WaPo now and he isn't a fan of btc. Most comments on this seem to be from the "all media is evil blahblahblah" camp and may be too fixated or too ignorant to notice this. Further, all the articles I linked are from the pre-Bezos era...although with such a small sample size I should note correlation != causation (unless you are the anti-science/conspiracy theorist type)

Hashcash in the late 90's. Tim May's BlackNet (the original darknet market). Nick Szabo's Bit Gold and his work in the 90s. Wei Dai's b-money (though I'm unsure how fully formed that was). If you look at the work of these guys and Hal Finney through the 90s and early 2000's you can really see how it all came together. Somebody just needed boil down this work and then to pair it with bittorrent (bit of an oversimplification obviously).

Yes. You can use the losses to offset any kind of income as well. You'll need to be filing a 1040 (which I think you may have figured out by now) and you can still use the standard deduction or itemized. You can only carry $3000 (IIRC) of those losses forward as an individual filer at a time; but if you have more you can still carry them forward for other years.     
So if you have $3000 in losses to carry over---even if you only have $1 in net cap gains the next year--- you can still use that to offset other income (ie wages).

Guess I better get to work, have alot of homes to break into and people to order to download BU and start mining now before I shatter their kneecaps.

  Also, I've reported gains from bitcoin for my '13, '14, '15 taxes and have dealt with reporting stocks, REITs, open option contracts and other horribles. I'm not a CPA but if anyone needs guidance I'll do what I can.

This, and the original article being addressed, help restore a small sliver of my faith in the bitcoin community (especially with respect to the comm. on reddit). This is how people in a rational, fact-based reality, seeking the same goal---maximizing btc's success--- behave.

Apparently not based on much of what people have been posting/commenting on this sub.
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:53:09
Funny you should mention the presentation. [Here]( is a graph I made about 3 days ago. I calculated it by taking the daily *sum* of tx data (i.e. Nov. 25 had 143mb of tx) divided by the total tx data capacity based on block qty (ie Nov. 25 had 152 blocks).        
So 143,000kb / (152*990kb) = 143mb/150mb = 95.33% of capacity used.       
I do need to update it to account for empty blocks and 749kb blocks, but I figured 990kb was a pretty decent constant. If you or anyone reading wants it, I have all the values hour by hour (tx size, blocks mined, # tx, all by hour) from june 15 to now in an excel spreadsheet
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:40:05
People seem to still fundamentally misunderstand why the mempool fills (not Lopp, but many commentors here). Look at the tx per sec rate:      
Note the steady growth. Note the ebbs and flows (monday/tuesday peaks). Now if we have 6 blocks per hour and an avg tx size of 510 bytes what can we handle? 995,000 bytes available for tx every ten min / 510 = 1950 tx per block. 1950 / 600 seconds = 3.25 tx per second.      
What would happen if the tx rate managed to edge above this for (most of) 24 hours, with an average tx rate at 3.60 tx/ps and rarely dipped below 3.25tx/ps?       
3.60 * 600 = 2160 ---*tx rate times # sec between blocks*      
2160 - 1950 = 210  ---*# tx that cannot be added to next block*       
210 * 144 = 30,240 ---*tx that couldn't be added to next block times # blocks in 24 hour span*     
      
So very quickly, a tiny increase in the tx/per sec rate for any sustained amount of time **will** cause the mempool to grow for **every** tx beyond this 3.25 per sec mark and that is how you can get 30,000 or more tx in the mempool through organic growth. I'd gladly bet a million satoshi this'll happen again around 11/29, 12/6, 12/13, or 12/20.         
The dead giveaway that it isn't spam (+ that it doesn't matter) is that these are not low fee txs. The fee rate per tx has steadily risen. Even if it were expensive spam, it would only take like 15 tx per minute to make enough of a difference to fill up the mempool like this. That's such an insignificant amount of tx that it doesnt really matter if it were spam, it could just as easily be organic, or a few hours in a row where we average 5.5 blocks mined instead of 6.        
    
**Put another way:**        
 If you are in a swimming pool and your mouth is two feet above the water or two inches above the water what difference does it make in your ability to breath? None.     
If your mouth were two inches *below* the water or two feet *below* the water, what difference would this distance make in your ability to breath? None.     
You breathe fine at a depth of &lt;5 feet, and drown at a depth of &gt;5 feet. We've spent every tuesday-wednesday inches around this point all year. You just don't notice it unless you're one of the ones stuck drowning in the pool.

Honestly, bitcoin aside, I thought Altavista was awesome until it was bought out by Yahoo. It stopped existing after that basically, IMO, as it was more of a buy-out to kill a competitor than an investment. I do miss the days before search engines got so dumbed down (though I suppose the average user became more and more computer illiterate over time as internet usage broadened).
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:08:53
^ pretty accurate.    
   
@_date: 2016-12-25 08:17:51
I do, like I said I have every hour for the past few years in terms of tx qty, blocks, total tx size, total fees, etc.         
 Looking at 12/2 and the days before it, its a miracle the mempool wasn't even more full. There was enough overnight drops in the tx/sec rate and alot of hours where 7, 8, 9, 10 blocks were found.  But you can even see the mempool in the days before starting to build up: [take a look](    
That's the total data size of the mempool---there is a higher share of data for lower fee txs than normal. and when we take a look at the avg tx size for this time we see a pretty big jump from the ~500 norm to &gt;1000 bytes a tx. This suggests a few txs had a large number of inputs ("sweep transactions"). Dec 2 being on a Fri would help to explain this as it isn't uncommon to see tx size jump a bit on fridays. **But** it is important to note what I mentioned earlier, that you can see on 11/28, 29,30, 12/1 that we were already starting to cross the max tx/sec rate and the pool was starting to fill. Add a few sweep txs on top of this and you got a serious backup real fast. **Plus** on top of all this we had a few streaks where &lt;6 blocks were found per hour; and an hour where only five blocks are found takes our max tx/sec rate down to 2.77 tx/sec.          
    
I know i'm kind of all over on this so if you want me to copypasta the data so you can 'see' it better feel free to let me know. But I hope you can see what I mean

If blockchain.info's chart on chain size is correct then around 40mb, so about .0005% its current size. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:44:36
Yes, at least in the short run miners benefit from the tx per sec rate exceeding the maximum. After the max (3.33~ tx per sec) is crossed we are faced with increasingly inelastic demand so fees per tx become greater and greater.          
However, can you link me to the basis for the spam attacks. I see the mempool is full, but I am not convinced it is something other than organic growth since the tx per sec rate is not outside the normal range.
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:33:03
'higher' price? so they mean it sarcastically? or is it meant to be taken as a different definition? like bitcoin will be 'higher' because we will all decide to raise our PCs/servers/thumbdrives +2 inches in elevation in 2017?        
          
     
The only 'higher' that is more confusing than that would be seeing the number of upvotes for this tripe going higher.
@_date: 2016-12-23 20:52:01
I'd absolutely be happy to give it a shot. Let's lay out a few constants first: avg tx size of 500bytes, block every ten min or 6mb an hour, block can hold about 2,000 txs (sound agreeable?)     
So 2000 tx a block / 600 seconds = 3.333 tx/sec is the most we can handle before the mempool fills. Anything **below** this and the mempool will not be full anything **above** this and the mempool **will** fill. So let's look at the average tx/sec rate over time to figure out what 'normal' really is:    
Q3 2015 - 1.45 tx/sec    
Q4 2015 - 1.90    
Q1 2016 - 2.37    
Q2 2016 - 2.56     
Q3 2016 - 2.56      
10/1-12/1 - 2.90      
12/1-now - 3.07 (median)        
Now the important part for what you're asking. The tx/rate tends to ebb and flow; saturday and sunday are almost always lower than the average, and weekdays are almost always higher than the average. Let's look at an individual case and break it down:    
on Sun. 12/18 there was little to no backlog but as we rolled into Monday things started to back up.      
   
I happen to have all the hourly data in Excel, hopefully it looks okay in reddit's markdown. First number is tx/sec rate for each hour which is derived from taking the total tx's in each hour divided by 3600 (seconds in an hour). Next column is simple 4 hour moving average (((3.15+1.72+2.79+2.86)/4) then (1.72...+2.16)/4 and so on)

I have all the hourly data for total txs, total data size, and other metrics for the past couple years in Excel if you'd like it. But the **main point here is that if you note the overall tx rate has been steadily increasing (as shown near the top) and you know the tx/rate tends to ebb and flow from the hourly view, then it becomes more clear that as the average tx/sec rate approaches 3.33 we will see more and more filling.**          
It is my view that we will eventually face a constantly "full" mempool, regardless of hardfork to 2mb or softfork to Segwit or if we increase to 8mb even. **Eventually** blocks will be full near constantly and the question, *in my opinion*, should be "What blocksize limit maximizes benefit for both user and miner?"         
and this question can be answered, *in my view*, with calculus and a [Marshallian Surplus](                    
        
I'm happy to answer any questions if I wasn't clear at any point and if you have any criticisms/rebuttal feel free to share.

If I had extra money to invest I would be all over making/investing a side-chain startup, long as the blocksize at 1mb or stays small anyway. There'd still be enough decentralization as long as there are a few sidechain facilitators (right? if its fairly competitive i mean).    
Risky though, I'd be so pissed if once I got it off the ground the blocksize limit ended up increasing.

So everyone commenting here is being sarcastic right?     
  
*A reddit account less than a week old claims Uphold is insolvent.     
*OP discloses no accounting credentials or experience     
*Doesn't mention consulting with an accountant or similar     
*Doesn't mention seeking comment from Uphold     
*their method of accounting used to determine they are insolvent is:     
 "Let's subtract the Voxel currency and look at Uphold’s actual balance sheet:
$5,652,329 in Assets $5,772,180 in Obligations to Members.
= A deficiency of $120,000!"     
Let's do no research into voxel and just subtract it from the balance sheet. Thats how accounting works right?    
 This would be like me saying I think that the iPhone is overvalued on Apples quarterly filings, so I'm going to just subtract it from their assets....what's this? A gaping hole? OMG APPLE IS INSOLVENT! I BETTER GET ON REDDIT AND ANNOUNCE IT BEFORE CONSULTING ANYONE!        
Now we see why OP created a new account for this, he had to think at some point "gee if I'm wrong could I be civilly liable for any losses Uphold incurs? ~~Maybe but I believe that my math is right and I believe in what I'm saying so I'm going to stand behind my claim~~"      
LOL JK /clicks new account link/        
I found it in 5 minutes of googling that Voxel was released, for sale, on Uphold and that users exchanged Bitcoins for them. So this wasnt some altcoin that was just deposited on an exchange, they received a shit ton of Bitcoin for it (which went to help Voxel's development, but no doubt Upshot got a nice chunk).      
 
Lastly, no one seems to realize Upshot has to have a ton of assets that aren't disclosed on that list. Do they own servers? Do they collect any user fee's or revenue? Do they have any cash on hand or investments? It's certainly likely since they can pay to keep the servers on and apparently **pay employees to deal with an asshole that posts, at the start of a holiday weekend, that the company is insolvent**     
**Sure seems like someone is out to get smear Uphold or Voxel**     
Not sure yet? or still in denial and cognative dissonance not hitting you yet? consider OP's comments in his first post after it gains traction:    


Beyond the **scary fact** that in 24 hours over $210,000 in real obligations to members have been depleted (4% of the assets in 1 day equates to a full insolvency in 24 days),...."      
emphasize mine. [see comment here](           
The worst part here? That first story has a score at **157.** This one, posted at midnight on a monday, has **11.** So few commentors said anything about the account being a week old or questioning his math or background.     
Is this candid camera or something? Has everyone here lost there fucking mind?    
So disappointed right now.

also my suggestions for topics:        
* when do we want fee's to become relevant to miners/what reward stage?       
(can we study possible scenarios based on user/dailytx/$ growth rates to get a few possible trajectories)?          
      
* assuming we want some kind of eventual limit to create fees viable for mining, what are we going to do if bitcoin usage takes off? even at 32mb blocks the network would stuggle to do 10,000,000 tx/day     
(at that point are we "good enough off" that we can let new traffic runoff to altcoins and assume offchain tx companies will form as a sort of secondary market?)             
     
I feel like I sound like i'm in favor of no increase in limit here with these suggestions but I'm actually strongly in favor of an immediate increase----its just I don't want to see a no limit or too high scenario where miners don't get incentivized when reward really gets cut down.

I like that you include the coding for verification/those of us learning to code. I don't know that I'd reach the same conclusions with the questions you are raising but I think you are raising fair questions... Forget which pools still softlimit at 750kb but that and 0 tx blocks would be nice to control for (maybe you did and I missed it).      
Either way interesting analysis and (assuming OP is author and owner/connected to site) awesome site for those of us learning to code, look forward to playing around with it.

What? No one MB inflation number to compare?     
Your close and your %'s are on but I think your a little mixed up. Inflation is primarily determined by the monetary base and there is a number for that since it is simply currency+bank reserves. Currency we can get from M1 money supply and reserves are given.      
Now for the inflation part, this is determined with MV=PY, where M is the money supply, V is velocity, P is price level, and Y is GDP(or sales, etc). An example: JMWtoria, a small nation, has a money supply (M) of 1200 JMshmeckles, the velocity(V) is 2, and their GDP(Y) is 16000. How can we figure out P, the price level (inflation)?       
(1200)(2)=16000p         
2400=p/16000        
2400/16000=p        
p=0.15       
Think about it too, if your GDP grew and was 20000 JMshmeckles next year, all else constant, P would be 0.12---inflation went down so the same 1200 JMshmeckles 'bought' more.   
In a way "there's no one inflation number"       
     
edit: corrected M in MV=PY, it's the money supply not the base...though right now they are very close to 1:1 in the US economy.

Actually the high is 259k from 9/17 from what I can tell. I see 241k for yesterday. Still important as part of the big picture though, we are def at capacity. For any doubters: average tx size is 550 bytes and with miners that softlimit at 750kb and slow validation "zero transaction" blocks we are at more like a block limit of 900kb. That means each block can do an average of about 1650 tx's, why does that matter? We avg about 150 blocks a day, 150*1650 = 247,500. We start getting about that number of tx's per day and the mempool starts clogging up and fees have to increase or tx's not get sent. This is why we see the average hourly total of fee's go from &lt;.60btc(just under .10btc per block) in Jan 2015 to an hourly of 1.65btc (.275btc per block) for 2016 so far.     
Yes fees may need to grow to support miners as blockrewards shrink, but 260k tx daily max before tx's get priced out of the market? that's way too low. Bitcoin needs to be able to handle more than 3 on-chain tx's per second to ever grow and fees still make-up &lt;2% of miner revenue...even after the next halving fees will still be of little value to miners.      
     
It's like a seedling you have sprouted in a tiny 3 inch^3 planter. It may get bigger and give you oxygen but if you don't transplant it into a big pot it will never reach its full size, potential or beauty. Sure its scary and would need to be done delicately; but that's no reason to keep it from thriving is it?
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:38:09
Monetary base inflation doesn't really matter if the banks sit on the reserves---and with the expansion of negative interest rate programs it looks like they intend to keep sitting on them. Sure QE has increased the base but money velocity and the money multiplier are low.       
For others reading---Velocity is a measure of how much money changes hands, the money mult. is the ratio between the money supply (M1) and the monetary base.       
The multiplier has been below 1 for a long time now--- a multiplier below 1 is unprecedented in modern history, and it means that banks reserves are larger than deposits. This shouldn't happen in a fractional reserve currency. This is due to the fact that all the banks that benefited from QE are just sitting on that money rather than lending it or even investing it. Its like the money doesnt exist if it isn't getting used.      
Thus the base can explode in size but if the velocity---which is found by taking the real GDP and dividing by the money supply---is low and the GDP grows more than the money supply does, then inflation cannot happen.      
BUT if banks did decide to start using these reserves then the money supply would increase and we could be looking at inflation. Its kind of fucked, because if the banks do use alot of these reserves then it makes their money less valuable since it would cause inflation (assuming the Fed doesn't sell bonds/act in response). By itself though QE could be used to take another 10 trillion in assets of the books/put $10 trl in their reserves and this would have ZERO effect on inflation. Its once these reserves turn into other things that inflation can happen.

I've really heard nothing but good things. I've seen alot of people switch from Coinbase to them and seem to like it. I just setup an acct. but unfortunately they only have major national banks listed for the bank acct. verification/link and I use a regional credit union so they say I have to do a wire transfer---but they do say they'll reimburse me up to $20 for it.     
I'm just hoping that after my stuff is verified that if I do the wire transfer that then I'll be able to link my credit union acct for ACH transfers---doing wire transfers instead of ACH everytime I want to buy/sell would be a deal breaker.

The futures contract need not settle in a very short time, this is why they exist.      
Orange grower has a pretty good harvest one year, ~5% more yield than avg, but price of oranges is down 25% by time he hits market, looks like he'll have to go without getting new equipment again this year.       
Solution to this. Guy in Chicago says i fucking love orange juice but i'm afraid the price is going to go up 100% by winter, I will buy 10 tons of your oranges 6 months from now for current market rate at $52/ton. Deal is made. 6 months later price is $38/ton but the farmer delivers them as promised, Chicago trader pays the $52/ton and doesn't mind the loss since he has his beloved oranges and offloads a few ton at grocery store chain.    
By the time the oranges get to that grocery store they aren't really a commodity, they are produce. You can't buy a futures contract for 3 oranges.       
The futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell something at a set date and at a set price. As the guy above said your grocery store isn't selling you two tons of oranges a year from now---they aren't a commodity exchange.    
However the grocery store can put a bitcoin atm in and sell you bitcoin, OP gives no context as to why they can't and is likely pretty dim and is conflating retailers and consumers lack of demand for buying bitcoin in a brick and morter store as some sort of government overreach.      
In short: Thanks Obama

Here's a relevant chart I just [made with FRED showing percent of total banks by size.](    
Blue=Banks with avg assets &lt;$300 million      
Red= Banks with avg assets between $300m and $1billion      
Purple= Banks with avg assets &gt;$1 billion      
This is just the number of banks as percentage though---i.e. the chart shows 93% of banks had assets of &lt;$300 million in 1988 but by 2015 only 67% of banks were &lt;$300m       
A good follow up to this would be same catagories but with share of assets...would need to add &gt;$20 bln catagory since the big five have &gt;50% of all assets.

I guess 'worthless' is redundant though^lulz     
           
I forget the author (O'neal? Krasner?) but I always thought the definition was a prime example of how the "science" of politics is bull. Trying to define broad, complex, abstract, words and concepts like 'government'  with these forced, one line definitions that are meaningless.

Consider this: when you buy a lottery ticket and win $20 do you report that? Even though it is a state lottery there isn't any real expectation to report this until the winnings get large. In my state for instance (PA), it isn't until you hit $600 that you need to fill out the back of the ticket and actually report it.     
However if you are committed to reporting this or have alot of income from it you can always offset your winnings with losses if you itemize your deductions. That is, if you bet $1000 ten times and win five times for a total gain of +$6000 and the other five times you lost a total $5000 of then your gains and liability is only $1000.

Just as if you buy a $2 lottery ticket and win $10, are given an expensive wrist watch as a gift, or buy a comic book for $30 then a few months later sell it for $50---you are supposed to report bitcoin profits and pay taxes just the same.       
Now would anyone actually report any of these things? No, there isn't a realistic expectation to. However if you won $100,000 on a lottery ticket, or bought $300,000 of comicbooks then sold them for $500,000 that would be something you might want to report/pay taxes on.     
Unless you have several thousands of USD in **profit** from bitcoin then I wouldn't worry.   
 If you do decide to report it, then remember that you can offset capital gains with capital losses (up to a few thousand $)

Protip: buying bitcoin &gt;1% below market value is typically not going to be safe. I can't tell you how many scams I've seen of the "introductory offer X is pleased to announce we are offering to sell btc 15% below market value for a limited time!"       
Anyway, it could be +5% a week later, or even if you buy below value the price could drop -5% the next day. So maybe you aren't ready to buy bitcoin as an investment? Maybe buy some to use and spend to start. If it is still important to have a good entry point then look into how-to technical indicators work---specifically MACD---and buy in on the reverse.

That's good to hear, I think this is an overlooked part of growing bitcoin; maybe it's because those of us that use bitcoin are often computer geeks and are introverts bad at walking up to someone to persuade them--- but it's something that needs to be done to keep growing bitcoin.  I'm surprised that anytime I approach merchants that so many of them have heard of it but have *never* been approached by anyone else about accepting btc.    
I approached an owner of an e-cig/coffee shop I frequent last week and I couldn't win them over (not yet anyway) but it's important to keep trying elsewhere---people need to see "btc accepted here" to feel like "well i guess I can buy things with that bitcoin stuff, maybe i should see what its about". Little stuff like that is what gets the coffee drinker who never thought about bitcoin to switch over to use their smartphone to pay in their daily routine.     
     
Good story, you don't need bitpay to incentivize you though---or you shouldn't---you should do it because you want to see btc succeed and it will raise the value of your bitcoin in time. Regardless, have $1 for doing what needs done @_date: 2015-09-05 05:33:02
Pretty much... I hear you man, I bought my first BTC at about $8 and remember the 'devestating' fall from $30 and have watched it (not just price) grow in ways I never expected. But watching this whole split has been painful. I hate to say it because I know I'm opening myself up to attack but it seemed like alot of the people that I've seen who were attacking BIP101 (and oftentimes, attacking any proposed change really) have been those lacking a technical understanding of BTC. This isn't to say they don't care about BTC, far from it they are often very passionate about it, but more so from a political perspective. But those who contribute code on github and get into the nitty gritty of the mechanics all seemed to be in favor of increasing the blocksize at the least.    
I mean yeah XT was a pretty bad way to go about things, would have been much better to get the devs all on the same page with piecemeal proposals, though I mean BIP101 wasn't anything radical--- I mean do people really think Bitpay and such would be in favor of something that is bad for their business model and cedes control?     
In the end, the pools all seem to be in favor of 8mb blocksize now that they realize its in their own best interest (those that didn't before) so we'll likely get the biggest change anyway. Frankly I'm glad that bitcointalk, 'the masses' generally aren't the ones voting, people voting on things they don't understand is not a good thing. I'll admit I don't know enough about all the technical ins and outs and am a pretty poor coder, therefore I should have no say over anything related to the network mechanics or code of core.     
De/Centralized isn't always as zero-sum/black or white as some people think, who is deciding BTC Core's future? The miners. Who are the miners? The pools. How many pools are out there? Alot, but only about 8 pools mine &gt;90% of the blocks. Sounds pretty...centralized? No?

I agree with others, you aren't actually holding the securities so that means they have to cover the gains on their own. So if Netflix goes up 100% in a week then they have to pay out alot at once---which seems to explain why only a dozen or so companies are offered, as they are all large cap and not likely to shoot up quickly. Still they would basically have to match every users "purchase" with an actual USD purchase on their own to cover it and with the leverage options that means they'd have to be leveraging themselves AND have to deal with the flux between BTC/USD.

I've argued before that the problem here is the approach to how we define this. Lets assume that bitcoin adoption will be widespread and we'll want to be able to handle 100 (or 500, 1000, whatever) tx/sec without the fee exceeding $1 (or $.10, $10, etc).     
 Ultimately raising the blocksize by itself is not a solution but is payment-channels a solution by itself? How many txs and at what price do we want to target for txs 'on the block'? At the end of the day the mempool is always going to have txs in it, as it should.    
But if, in 2018, a 1mb blocklimit (with segwit, payment channels, etc) means that the mempool has nominal size of 100k txs and the average 2-block conf fee is .01000000 btc then that is no good---miners are getting rich and users bore a huge cost. Similarly, in 2018, with a 8mb limit (with seg.....etc)...... has 1k and the avg 2-block conf costs only .00000100/tx then with a diminishing block reward miners are getting shafted and the surplus is enjoyed fully by users----also no good.        
What I think we need to consider is adopting a social benefit maximization model akin to what you would see in public policy economics. This sort of thing is done all the time to determine optimal taxation and how to "price" emissions for environmental regulation. I've done some modeling with it and I'm fairly sure the model could be built. However I haven't seen much written on it on Cornell's arXiv or other academic databases.

edit: I see evidence disproving your claim. See chart of ( interv. of fees (sum) + tx/sec rate]. tx/sec rate doesn't show anything terribly unusual even with a lower MA and the fees have only grown with the backload. ( 4 day] chart shows that most are paying &gt;.0003000/kb and that the avg fee is growing.

Actually you do. The price elasticity may be greater on the consumer end but given the widespread state of credit card acceptance the burden of increased price is bore in part by consumers.

and the tx/sec rate has already passed its trough for today with 42k still in mempool as of 0130 EST; a few more hours when the next peak is due should be interesting, especially if it breaks &gt;3.33~ tx/sec for a few blocks.

I've wondered about the possibility of a saboteur element, if it does exist and I've seen enough baseless attacks on devs, MIT, Uphold and other startups that I actually hope there are saboteurs and that the community isn't this horrible. I definitely don't think OP is one---I've seen their posts here and there and skimming through this they seem to care about btc and are probably smarter than me. But, and **this is what genuinely bums me out**, OP comes to the conclusion that this (Wright stuff) is some kind of attack on Core from the 'big block side'. One of my biggest takeaways from all the wright nonsense is that Gavin really got screwed since he put his reputation on the line and seems to have genuinely thought this guy was legit. And no, I'm **not** saying that this was an attack on Gavin or Classic or etc. What I'm saying is that whoever these saboteurs were/are they did a great job of dividing and then blinding us. If it's not clear yet then consider an analogous circumstance to the Republican/Dem split where each side just gets the news from sources that reinforce their own viewpoints. I admit I even ended up drinking some of the kool-aid back when this started before I realized how messed up things were.              
I wish I had a good/hopeful/convincing point to make but all I can offer is: if your only involvement beyond usage in the btc community is on reddit, then you are in trouble (whether r/bitcoin, r/btc, r/btwhatever). You'd call someone that gets all their news from only one outlet a moron right?  if this is you then get on freenode or something. What are you still doing here? Go!         
    
And just to be clear on where I fall:     
* I think 2MB blocks are needed and it is preferable to Segwit right now. 
* But I think 2MB blocks should be done to buy time until the Lightning Network can be deployed because that's the most promising true scaling solution.     
* I even think replace-by-fee is mostly harmless...        
 Didn't seem to be a problem when it was in the client before---just like when we had no block size limit (or was it 32mb? either way...) I see segwit as riskier and a lot of work for a low return and I see 2mb blocks as better performing on test and more safe. But at this point, if Segwit is deployed and we get the added tx throughput and the network doesn't require any emergency hard forks then I think that's great and I'm all for it. Same with Classic though, Classic's existence isn't a threat to Bitcoin. It's a feature of it! Ideally miners will act in their own self-interest and pick the best solution. I mean c'mon thats day 1 stuff.    
   To me, both accomplish the same thing in making the blockchain stronger and give us some breathing room until Lightning or another solution can be deployed. I think that and so many other btc code contributors who had a perfectly reasonable difference of opinion got screwed by the bitcoin community. They made them symbolic leaders at different ends of this "us" vs. "them" battle dichotomy that never existed in the first place and the community at large could have let this run it's course and let the best solution win. But instead users took the liberty of launching truly disgusting personal attacks on "the other side's leaders" ranging from wikipedia edit history to their religion---as if they were nobly doing a favor for "their side's leaders". What was, at most, a passionate but academic difference of opinion was hijacked into this parade of horribles. Bitcoin will survive of course. But is this how we thank the people that have put in just as much time and effort as Satoshi? Plus, I'm sure as hell Satoshi will never come forward after seeing how this community expresses gratitude. So yeah, I hope there are saboteurs because if this is all from the community then I'm going to need a drink.      
I didn't mean for this comment to be so long and I doubt anyone will read it but I'm hoping OP or a similar user will be swayed---not to "core" or "classic" but to the middle and/or out of here(reddit). And sorry for the paging but someone has to give these people **non-partisan** appreciation once and a while.

Personally I am no libertarian and am a long time fan of btc. I don't view it as something to supplant USD or any other currency, but rather a complement to other payment methods. Cash/ACH/Credit is well and good but not suited for internet payments (long distance p2p). I view btc less as a political tool and more of part of the new digital/open-source world we are going to be living in, but I also view the Federal gov as a necessary and important function of society that shouldn't (not always) be avoided.      
Look at Coinbase's approach and Gemini seeking approval for btc ETF. It's a varied community open to everyone.

I think summed things up pretty well (don't think I've ever said that before)     
    
However I'd like to add that this approach, or any other thus far like miner voting, isn't going to be reliable for major protocol changes. It is going to lead to outcomes that are not Pareto optimum.      
For instance, consider allowing miners (or users) to set the block size limit via signaling:         
Normally I wouldn't go into such detail but given that so many users seem to misunderstand what maximizes miner self-interest. Though more people seem to be aware---given the current fee rates---that more tx per block doesn't necessarily equal revenue maximization.         
Take a look at this [spreadsheet I made to illustrate](      
      
 The last column is a running total of miner fee revenue where negative values indicate larger blocks is more profitable and positive is for 1mb blocks. In the hypothetical the txrate maxes out at something like 5.xx tx/sec but you can feel free to modify the tx/rate and whatnot. For 2mb (or larger) blocks to be profitable for miners, the txrate has to be consistently above the previous limit and the non-backlogged fee rate has to be higher.             
So miners have an incentive to constrain capacity and users will always favor a limit that doesn't ever fill up the mempool. How can these actors be trusted to reach a Pareto efficient outcome for protocol changes that affect fees? They can't.        
The only strategy I have been able to come up with is using variations of a Marshallian total surplus maximization equation; at least this way Pareto optimum outcomes can occur rather than each side being Nash oriented.

Good work to OP and for putting this all together. Makes it perfectly clear why he is going to such great lengths to give the "proof". Wonder what his next step in his plan was if he was able to convince everyone? Maybe beg the bitcoin community for 'donations' because he somehow 'lost' access to all those coins (but yet can still prove he is Satoshi lulz)?        
   I suppose in a way we should thank him because he is demonstrating what makes Bitcoin so strong--- it's immutability. Anyone responding to media inquiries on whether he is SN (for when they report their 'corrections') should point out that btc is why we can tell he is not SN and maybe the journalists will be able to see, and mention in articles, why btc is no funny money.

Would help to post a link that isn't a live updating page or include in your post how many txs are in the mempool. Guessing from your submission time it was around 10k. Basically, every week tx volume peaks on monday/tuesday and bottoms out on sundays. The network can handle about 12k tx an hour, or 3.33 tx per second before the mempool gets backed up and txs get priced out of the network---demand exceeds supply in short. It looks like there was briefly &gt;5 tx per/sec. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:57:42
Right, you'd have a marginal cost = marginal revenue kind of thing with alot of ineffecient miners getting pushed out... but I don't think we'll ever see that again. Everyone has access to the same technology (or near-identical) and largely faces the same costs so even if mining wasn't pooled you would still be able to assume miner preferences/self-interests across the board.            
The rub here is that fee elasticities are largely straight lines----anytime the tx/sec rate is below 3.333 (or mempool empty, or 1mb/10min) users aren't going to pay shit. anytime the tx/s rate is above 3.333 (or mp filling, 1mb/10min) elasticity goes verticle and users will make txs expensive.

Because of the community split a couple years ago. IIRC it was mid-2015 BIP101 was proposed to increase BSL (block size limit) to 8mb initially then to like 8gb over 20 years. The whole changing BSL idea was mildly contentious prior to this as it would require a hard fork and due to ideological differences. BIP101 didn't really come together and was seen, by some, as too drastic a change. Still in the summer 2015 Gavin goes ahead and releases Bitcoin XT, this is seen as an affront to other devs since rather than working out scaling within regular order--bitcoin-qt's normal dev process---gavin is circumventing consensus building by trying to get miners difference a new client signaled to fork to this half baked scaling setup.     
     
**XT goes over poorly** for obvious reasons and is responded in kind with censorship here on r/Bitcoin when it comes to pro XT related posts and those with legitimate views that Bitcoin needs a bigger BSL are viewed as "pro-XT traitors", regardless of whether they thought XT was right course. Thus these people are then alienated and feel stymied so many support XT out of pure spite. Others, aware that XT is pretty bad idea but want scaling splinter off and by early 2016 they propose Bitcoin classic, what was meant to be a fork to 2mb and nothing else.      
   
     
^^^^^^i       
**Classic was still seen**, and was, going outside the normal dev process. But by this time it was clear that a BSL BIP wasn't ever going to fly. So classic supporters put forth the view that "we are going to max out very soon and fees are going to explode while the mempool backs up more and more" "so let's fork to 2mb to give some breathing room, show that Bitcoin can reach a middle solution and everyone can then calm down and finally unify afterward. "     
     
        
^^^^^^i         
**It didn't happen**. Sides had gotten too bitter and paid troll-shills fanned the flames. Core was already invested into segwit, a convoluted way to increase capacity but with a bunch of great features rolled into it to make it more palatable. By the time it was put out there many Classic supporters either left for other coins, accepted segwit as the only way forward(and hoped that payment channels &amp;such would pan out), or had hardened their position.        
This splintering and hardening on the pro-BSL increase led to BU being seen as the best route among those who remained. These users tended to often see any non-mainchain scaling as death, or were less concerned with long term viability (or didn't care about medium term strain from 32mb blocks?), or simply supported it out of hatred of core, censorship, the "other side" and lacked the technical understanding of Bitcoin to see it as a shit solution. Then, as some on the core(or r/Bitcoin) side came to terms with cognitive dissonance from increasingly frequent mempool backlogs and high-fees that r/btc types had warned of, they began to support BU. Not surprisingly they also lacked the technical understanding of Bitcoin to see BU as a shit idea (I say not surprisingly due to thier clear inability to believe that organic adoption was going to lead to higher fees and clogged mempool).        
         
      
     
^^^^^^i       
**This leads us to our** current state, segwit can't get enough support from BU/ r/btc types, miners realize they are better off maximizing fees (I.e. keeping the status quo), many of the more intelligent and technical users jumped ship for altcoins, bitcoins market share is slipping, the mempool is going to be backed up even on weekends soon (an inevitability even if we had segwit and/or 2mb blocks) and the price is up so no one cares.     
   
XT was a really stupid way to go about scaling but would have died on its own. The censorship here really just led to users getting more and more stupid and ill-informed compounded by smart and long time users leaving. Also really stupid: core not accepting a 2mb fork in early 2016.  If you alienated your user base long enough they'll do something really dumb, like a non-consensus chainsplit for 32mb blocks.           
So, basically, welcome to the cesspools: this sub... r/btc. It doesn't matter. Look at all the shitty comment replies you've got so far. Go ask the same thing but reversed on r/btc and you'll get equally dogshit replies.      
I recommend irc.freenode.net. Or r/buttcoin; buttcoin is lulzy

Other than the retirement account as someone else mentioned, no. I'm simplifying here, but pretty much any asset you sell after holding for less than a year is a short-term capital gain and the profit is subject to tax (sell price - purchase price = profit *.15(or .20, .25...). If it is something you held for over a year then you are subject to long-term gains.        
An exception is option contracts held from 12/31 to the next year, these have some pain in the ass valuation procedure.

This is very interesting. At first I didn't realize GBTC=the same btc investment trust DCG was launching a while back so I looked at as a OTC stock that didn't want to follow the proper ETF way of doing this. After I realized what it was (or rather who) this makes sense. There are not really simple ways for portfolio mangers to add btc to their funds; for reasons you can imagine, they have a much easier time having holdings in the form of traditional securities.      
Looks like there is enough pent up demand and that mutual fund mgrs view btc stable enough to hold(!!!) that enough funds are willing to pay the premium. They likely also take the traditional long-term view of btc that it will either be worth tons or nothing in 5 years, so why not put 0.5% of the total fund in it?       
I mean that it isn't an ETFs/index funds shouldn't matter anyway since so many ETFs out there are total garbage that don't track the reference asset well at all. Many just go off the rails enough that the ETF operator will just do a split/reverse-split to force it to re-peg, which is total bullshit.      
Either way, should be interesting symbol to keep an eye on.

They may not have even been subpoenaed. IIRC many of the relevant rules/regulations for banks that are part of the BSA and Patriot Act apply to money transmitters and MSBs. If I had to guess how this was carried out with regard to Coinbase:     
Those investagting Vaulin submited Patriot Act 314(a) to FinCEN. This means that every US bank(or MT/MSB) would pretty much have to flag an account matching the name in the request and are required to then contact FinCEN with where they want their subpoena served to. Non-compliance isn't much of an option.     
There are other ways via the BSA it could have been obtained. Entities like Coinbase are required to file SARs for all kinds of stuff and if something they flagged as an SAR is in fact something investigators want, then they can get alot of info without a subponea.       
So 31 C.F.R. sec 103.18 (plus 31 C.F.R. sub. B as a whole) and the Patriot Act sec 314 is where the authority is derived. Pretty much any DOJ agency is empowered, with FinCEN doing most of the legwork.

Okay but what if 100 million people want $100 worth of bitcoin? That's what I'm getting at is the future. I need to double check the exact number but I'm pretty sure there is a finite supply of 21 trillion units. If these 21 million coins are to be split among say 210 million people, I'm speculating that they will put $100 of their local currency "in" bitcoin, causing the price per coin to be $1000.

Actually I'm talking when and if bitcoin is a currency. As an investment I'm not so sure about the long term value, it could be anything. M1 money supply is anything that ISNT considered an investment (more or less, currency+checking deposits), so the comparison is directly to currency only. As an investment it can be worth anything. As a full-liquidity currency with 100+ million plus users it would have to be worth a great deal more than it is now if it is to remain relevant.

Well now we're starting to get into the abstract of what money and value really is. I would suppose you could say that in the early 80's gold wasn't falling but rather the value of the dollar was going up. Kind of a tomato tomato(pronounce this one toe-mott-oh) thing. However the value of gold also falls against other goods not just currency, not that gold is often used for purchases.
All the gold in the world /= all of a gold market.  Sure there is paper money that sits under a mattress for 10 years but most bills are in active circulation and it's easier to pinpoint an exact number. Lots of gold however just sits as excess reserves or elsewhere which makes using it for the comparative purposes I needed a bit hard.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:32:30
I see your thinking but since gold rises and falls so much in expansionary/contractionary periods and gold isn't really a currency with a base to compare it to it gets a bit messy. 1% of the gold market can be a hard figure to measure compared to the US M1 supply.

Not sure that's the same study I was thinking of but undoubtedly a large number of that 78% are "lost" coins. The one I was thinking of put the number at something like 71% which i'd guess to be total BS. I picked 16 million rather arbitrarily, even if there isn't a single coin missing the math is much the same, relatively speaking. I wanted to look a few years into the future rather than account for 21 million in 100 years. In my head I was thinking around 2016-2019 when there is 16-19 million coins and figured I'd take off a million for "lost" coins. That really doesn't make too much of a difference though in the math as I said.
