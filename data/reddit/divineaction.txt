you should look into other coins that will surpass bitcoin in coming years
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:32:53
no you should buy vertcoin, it has more potential

Haha absolutely me

stripper butts tend to have millions of germs, so i think your right

Sadly no one every stopped the government from spending too much.
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:47:45
I dont even mention bitcoin to anyone, i just keep buying it up
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:21:49
The problem is this wont happen, unless all government jobs were shut down

the start of bitcoins uprising,
banks falling
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:24:59
Does this mean that when a collapse does happen these people may have more than some Americans?

ive been selling high and buying back in lower, i have doubled my bitcoin holdings since march

There are many chrome plugins to buy from online shops. I recommend you to not spend any btc atm and hold instead.

Im not ready for a bull run just yet :/

Can you keep the price below 5,000 for another year?
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:31:12
I started dipping my toes into crypto through coinbase. For certain reasons I only buy through Bitcoin ATMs now. The only downside is having to pay 10-12% premium on bitcoin.

I can relate. The past year and half i have been saving up as much as possible to buy small amounts. Sadly i'm waiting for that lower low to get in at a cheaper price and see greater returns.

Well aren't you smart, POS
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:03:53
Has to do more with what banks do with my money. They lend it out while i get a shity 2% a year

As someone who has played video games for most of their life, i can say that a limited supply can only mean something will become valuable.

Uncle Sam will know when you buy from coinbase and make sure he takes his cut when tax season comes around. He cant keep an eye on cash/ATM transaction unless you tie up the bitcoin addresses.

After swapping to XRP and having that run up 25% in a night i didn't even notice the difference.

I use Binance but there are other exchanges that dont require KYC. Do your research before you use a shady exchange that wont give you funds back.

That is why the Markup is high.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:10:42
Ive done it dozens of times and would do it over again because i just swap it to a lower cap coin that is guaranteed to go up. Dont even think about the markup i paid on it. My gains are FAR GREATER and guess what. Uncle Sam doesn't even know I own a separate stash of crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:11:47
8- 15% markup is mainly used to pay taxes from the ATM operation license. Its the same for machines that convert coins into dollars.
