Limiting the block size to 1MB because of fears of a slippery slope is not a good argument. I think a layer 2 scaling solution is great but an increase to even just 2MB right now would greatly improve the customer experience and transaction backlog. A block size increase should have happened years ago. Let's do both

Look at who's on the payroll for Blockstream and look at the list of core devs. Count the names that appear twice. Look at peoples financial incentives compared to their viewpoints and follow the money yourself

Ah so I see we've devolved into ad hominems now. Im on no one's side. I'm not a big or small blocker. I want a bitcoin that is as useful as possible to the world. 
Also, Greg Maxwell isn't just employed by Blockstream, he is a cofounder. Blockstream profits from selling sidechain products meaning they have a financial incentive to cripple the main chain. The financial conflicts of interests of Blockstream and the core devs is clear as day. It's like Rorhabacher taking Russian money and suddenly being pro Russia. You think it's coincidence that people's viewpoints seem to align with their financial incentives?
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:12:47
Exactly. Complaining about a corporate takeover is laughable when Blockstream controls the devs and this subreddit

How is it a coup if core aren't the leaders?
