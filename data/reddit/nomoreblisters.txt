Satoshi travels back through time from an oppressed, regulated, Orwellian future, to seed the world with true freedom and liberty. Fighting the all powerful banking elite with the only weapon they respect... money.

I imagine it's a paid for template. Good spot :)

Good guide. Two things spring to mind which would make it better. Firstly, the title. "Everything to know to get you started with Bitcoins!". Why not something a little snappier, "Start using Bitcoins... today!" or "Getting started with Bitcoins".
Secondly, adding audio. Always makes a guide better when the instructor is instructing.

I don't have a job at the moment, hence why I can leave comments this late/early in the morning :/ ... I'm glad no one has tipped yet, I just fapped :(

I'm one of those that believe 10BTC will be worth considerably more than McDouble, maybe more than a McLaren. So yes, I would.
