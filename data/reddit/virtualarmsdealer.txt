Thanks for the reply.
I don't disagree with hardforks as evolution and I'm familiar enough with the Satoshi paper to know this is the way it's going to happen. My point is that I'd rather put my investment in Bitcoin Core rather than some HF spin off, I don't consider it an attack. This whole thing seems unnecessary and potentially damaging to the public impression of bitcoin.
Yes, LN is a degree of centralisation which is unfortunate but seems like a good scaling solution. Also, you can still transact with the blockchain directly without having to go though LN, which preserves the financial sovereignty associated with the original coin imo.

I'm not so sure about this. I would say bitcoins survival in some form is necessary for the whole cryptocurrency thing to gain traction with the general public and it is vital to the survival of litecoin, but ethereum could easily live on after bitcoins demise and so might monero, dash, ripple. They have active communities and serious interest from big investors. I hold a little ether and some btc just to hedge my bets.

Hodl only is for price speculators. The hodlers are the ones crashing the price when they hit their sell limits. Buying with bitcoin is a transaction, it's what gives bitcoin utility and ultimately what gives it any value. Hodlers are treating bitcoin as an asset rather than a currency.

@_date: 2017-09-29 20:11:15
I've taken some time this week to try to understand the NO2X protest. The more I read about the s2x fork the more I'm against it. The original philosophy behind BTC must be respected, this is not some startup trying for it's IPO!! It's a paradigm shift in the way people transact and store wealth. These s2x guys seem to be trying to capitalise on the underlying brand and technological value bitcoin offers while paying no respect to the original idea.
It seems obvious to me that BTC requires a larger block as no other solution to scalability problem seems to be forthcoming (except segwit and LN stuff), but this should be implemented via soft fork so as to protect against efforts to centralise, if it's going to be implemented at all.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:18:48
Considering this, don't wanna be the guy that gets his private keys swiped at gun point cause I was running my mouth about btc...we are only a few years away from this being a serious concern. Not that I have anything worth stealing currently :p
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:34:23
I might have this backwards... this is how it was explained to me, but my technical knowledge is a bit lacking on chain splits. As I understand it, during the splitting period and maybe after it, there is a chance that a transaction can be replayed on the other chain. So if I transact on btc chain, that can be replayed on the s2x chain and I can lose s2x coins, its unclear to me whether it is true that selling s2x would mean losing btc. I guess maybe s2x blocks would not be accepted by Core miners and thus btc would remain. I still wouldn't risk selling until the dust settles.

No this is a serious concern if you have 100k+ why fuck with a cashier at a corner store when you can just steal private key at gunpoint. Reason this isnt a prob currently is banks are insured up the arse to cover stolen funds. Remember, they hold deposits for you, they are often liable to repay stolen funds.

@_date: 2017-10-08 04:46:55
Yes, but without replay protection you can only spend the coins once. This is the big problem with s2x coin. It isn't free money. You can't spend s2x without losing BTC. I don't understand how this will be addressed.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:48:46
Yeah, ethereum follows bitcoin closely in price. I trade sometimes so I watch those charts like a fucking hawk. I also notice your average joe on the street isnt investing in ethereum, they all want bitcoin. If bitcoin dies ethereums unique utility could help it survive. Or it could just crash and burn as well, but something will take its place.

Clearly I need to do more research.
I was under the impression a blocksize increase could be implemented and made backwards compatible in much teh same way segwit was activated by UASF. Seems that was a false assumption. I still support the original idea and would prefer BTC to remain free from any silly hard forks in future, I would favor finding a solution to scalabilty that can be implemented by UASF.
Edit: Are 1mb limits to blocksize still a serious problem if segwit and lightning network grow?

@_date: 2017-09-30 03:16:37
That's interesting.
Seems they conclude any change to the blocksize ultimately makes older clients unable to process the block so is technically a hard fork even if implemented via UASF type 51% rule. Seems like a HF may be necessary unless some other scaling solution comes to light.

Yeah, speculators get into a trade knowing they have an exit strategy. I suspect many 'hodlers' go into it thinking they were investing, but given the right price, they will sell out. It's simple human greed, I'm not judging.

No replay protect is criminal.
I really don't like that they are attempting to sell this coin as 'bitcoin'. It is not bitcoin imo.
Im not worried though, so long as no damage is done to btc they can fail as many times as they want.
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:27:15
Last time it happened the price built just before the split as people bought up coins to maximise potential profits in the sell off. This was followed by a drop when everyone sold the new coins and the BTC which was at a high. We then had the Jamie Simon and China affairs which caused a correction and price drop. However, this is a different type of fork and given s2x has no replay protection I don't imagine it will go down the exact same way.
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:39:18
