Same thing happened to me.
I'm from the EU by the way.
Today my bank called and had some questions about my "suspicious" transaction.
Because of the stupid AML laws i'm under investigation.
First all that AML crap from the exchange that took weeks and now again the bank.I don't expect any problems because I can easily prove everything.
The big problem here however is tax.
There is no clear law if you have to report it only a shady one.
So it's all based on the interpretation of the tax man because the shady law is not defined with enough details.
So there is now way to report it correctly and not reporting can result in a fines + tax +interests larger than the initial amount.
To bad you can't buy a house directly with bitcoin here luckily every other thing is doable .

We need a open source app that doesn't send data to a server.
Why not make it open source for a price?
Like if the community donates ???? amount you make it open source.
You can still monetize it on the play store by putting ads on it or making it an paid app even if it is open source.

Where did you get this?
I live close to the german border.
Does this apply for all EU citizens?
Do you need to work in germany or is renting or buying a home enough.

At least we took the step the get control over our own money.
Better than giving your money to banks that factional reserve and don't even have your money.
That bitcoin currently is a privacy nightmare with current state of blockchain analysis is maybe a good thing.
This makes it more acceptable for states that want to track everything.
Once it is accepted we take the next step and take our privacy back.
By building privacy second layer or with atomic swaps with XMR.

Depends to what vpn server you connect to.
Netflix blocks a lot of known servers.
I use nordvpn they have a small list of servers listed that work with netflix and get fixed if netflix blocks them.
Most servers are indeed blocked by netflix.

wouldn't a big open source wallet be able to make their correct key generation processes different than the actual code and create binaries with this malicious code to create predictable keys/seeds. 
Most people don't build the thing from the source code itself.
If it is a long trusted project with a big user base nobody would notice if they use this the selectively scam a few people a year.

What did everyone suspect.
It has a public blockchain and all traffic is submitted unencrypted in plain text.
This combined with all the info they get with AML/KYC makes it a great surveillance tool.
This is why they allowed bitcoin to be legal.
A great tool to follow criminals.
For now we have control over our own money.
Once it is to big to ban we take our privacy back.
