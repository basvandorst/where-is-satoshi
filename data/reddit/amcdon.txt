Yeah I was talking to my mother about it the other day and she said "you're so smart, why don't you go work for bitcoin?" Even after explaining why that's impossible, she didn't understand it.

The point here is that the payment has been initiated via the bank but because of operating hours it won't actually be released to the payee until the next day. If the payer had used Bitcoin in the same situation, the payment would have still gone through.
Obviously, in either case the payer could mess up and pay really late or use the wrong address or whatever, but in the exact situation, the Bitcoin payment would have gone through.

I've already been using your app so I would be game for something like this. It might also be a good way to get more people using it so you're able to get the number of measurements that you're looking for.

Surely you're forgetting that a similar process is required to get the paper money in the first place: 
Walk up to ATM, reach for wallet, open wallet, take out card, insert card into ATM, enter PIN, select how much to withdraw, wait for transaction to process, reach for money, place money into wallet, wait for card to be ejected, place card back in wallet, close wallet, put wallet back in pocket.
Just because it doesn't happen at the place you're spending it doesn't mean it shouldn't be included in the process.

Since the other guy is being a prick, the statement you originally responded to was sarcasm. Basically, asking questions like OP did is entirely useless.

Thanks! What site do you like to use to see this?
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:19:56
Seems to be for me too.

Could you explain this a little more? Like how to actually determine whether there is an actual trading bottom? Thanks!
