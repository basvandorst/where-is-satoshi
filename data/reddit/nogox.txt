Yeah got some feedback with regard to the purchasing power and have made the change. Decided against using the blockchain icon purely because it's best to explain the blockchain as a big asset ledger. Yeah good idea with that last point.

Many thanks, some positivity on r/bitcoin? Have some gold.

Hey thanks for the feedback. Yeah the more I delved into bitcoin the more you realise there's a lot to take in. I wanted to make an infographic that answers those fundamentally who, what, why type questions but I'm definitely going to have to emphasize the answer to the counterfeiting question. I just didn't want to throw too much at them straight away rather make an appetizer and hopefully they learn more and ease into the subject. Thanks for the comment.

Hey is "buying power" the right term? I want to get this right.

Hey thanks for the feedback. 6 out of 7 people refers to the "other Six billion" which is mentioned by Andreas. I have had a hard time finding an exact source for that but Andreas is rather reputable. 
The nickel thing was there to demonstrate how a dollar can be devalued, through inflation by central control. 
Some credit card fees  for online merchants are 3.75%, some are 1%, some as you say are a fraction of a cent. Varies where and who your provider is.
A comment I recieved was it needed to be more "call to action" and that's why the 'How does it affect me?' was added there. 
Finding sources in this space is difficult, people are trying to push bitcoin, and some people are trying to put it down. If you know some great analysis/sources I'd love to know. Thanks.

I thought about it. The thing with infographics is to present simple ideas and I didn't want to throw too much at the reader. I've learnt a lot about bitcoin through trying to put this together and I had to be selective about what information I put forward. Hopefully an infographic like this could act as an appetizer for the reader to learn more. If I had enough room I would like to do something along those lines. Thanks for the feedback.

Thanks for the feedback. Yeah I guess it has, but for someone new to this world, illustrating what happened the past year is probably the most relevant information.. Updated the inflation description too ;).

Thanks for the feedback. Maybe a lunar capsule falling back to earth haha? Bitcoin is still like five times what it was this time last year, I'd say that's still a major descriptor for this past year.

Any recommendations, trying to get the balance right? Giving enough information to get a clear idea vs tell the full story. New to graphic design haha :)

Thanks :)

Cheers man. Was feeling the same way.

sounds like the next infographic :) Thanks.
