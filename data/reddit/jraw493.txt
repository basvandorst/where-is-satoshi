Your best bet would be to go with [Bitmain]( 
Also, check out lots of good information for new miners.

First, did you make sure you sent the payment to the right address?
If the address is right then did you contact coinbase about this issue?
If you did then what did they say?
If you haven't contacted them then what are you waiting for?

Updating to Yosemite Beta 5 as well?

I understand that it takes time to switch all their machines over to P2Pool. I am just curious why they took the units they already configured out of their own P2Pool node.  The last block they were part of with P2Pool was 308850.  None of the machines they configured have been on their own node since then.
[Here]( is a link to the last block they were part of.  Their wallet address is [here.](  
If you look through the transactions for the most recent blocks that P2Pool found you will notice that their wallet address is no longer participating.
It is also possible that they set up a new wallet to use with P2Pool, but the one they used in the beginning is the one linked above.  
Personally as a shareholder it makes me mad that there has been no updates whatsoever on Havelock or from the company itself whatsoever since they stated they ran into issues.

All I want to know is what happened to switching to the P2Pool.  An overwhelming majority voted for this to take place and the only update shareholders received said they ran into issues making the switch.
 posted [this]( thread showing how to implement the changes necessary for their equipment to work with P2Pool yet nothing at all was mentioned with the latest update from CryptX.
96% of their shareholders voted for this implementation to take place and it appears the CryptX has decided to ignore those that invested with their company.  What is the point in them even having shareholder votes if they are not willing to go in the direction that their shareholders want.

Shareholders voted for them to switch their mining equipment from GHash to P2Pool.  They updated us last week saying 96% of shareholders that voted wanted them to switch, CryptX said they their equipment had issues switching over and they would look into it.  The link I posted above shows it is possible to switch.
As for why they are not willing, your guess is as good as mine.
