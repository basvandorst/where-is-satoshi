If they took my stuff and loaned it out to other people and made a profit off of that as well, then yes.

Reminds me of an assignment I had in college to write about a controversial topic.  I wrote about legalizing hemp, I outlined all the industrial benefits, and why it is different than weed and how you can't get high smoking it.
I got an F.  Note said something like can't write about weed.

Thank you for the article interesting read.
"Expenses for the production of income..." 
sounds like you may be able to deduct the expense of your mining rig(s) and power.

I'd consider it, I hold bitcoin and litecoin and have been toying with the idea of using it to purchase a new shotgun.

Lots of people give a fuck, but none of them are politicians.

Hmmm.  I've been with CAP360 since 2009.  Over the past year I've bought about $100 per month or less from coinbase roughly every month  by doing one transaction out of a savings account I only use for coinbase, until this month I also used the same account for a celery purchase.
My average balance in this account is around a couple bucks, I only transfer in what I need to cover my purchase and have never done more than 2 per month.
So far I have not had an issue.
Do you have access to the linked account they transferred your money to?
