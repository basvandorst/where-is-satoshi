i wonder what kind of event will be held at the final mining of the last bitcoin ever. Will it be a huge event everyone will watch and chaos will ensue afterward or just another moment barely whispered anywhere.

You can't predict it but, you can buy back at any time at a lower point sure you run the risk of losing if it keeps dropping but at least you will end up with more BTC than you had before the dip on the inevitable bounce back.

Yup that's why I never got into it. Until now and still learning.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:30:36
Kinda Maybe. If she would of had an expert properly explain what it actually is and how it actually works instead of her powerpoint presentation people would of taken it more seriously and had more of an interest in it.
