How big of a crash are we talking`?

Hate to be that guy but it's a completely new account. More and more people are coming onto crypto subreddits with fake stories hoping for tips. Not saying it's fake based on this but well it's fishy. From the account age to the hourly wage and the bitcoin usage. You've got enough Bitcoin to travel to another country and live there for 1.5 years yet you go around walking miles to get BTC via cash? 
I mean I am sure some people are living like this for real. Investing it all in Bitcoin hoping for a better future while living as minimalistic and cheap as possible. In fact, there was such a story before of a family selling everything to do exactly that but just telling you to keep this all in mind.

Having a bitcoin is always a nice goal but there is no specific reason why that would be beneficial is there? Is it just to join the 21 million club?
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:54:34
A price increase of crypto doesn't equal to free bitcoin. You have the same amount it's just valued more. I get what you're saying though you're basically confident that the alt coins on coinbase will increase in price by a larger % than bitcoin will. So if Bitcoin goes up 200% another alt coin on coinbase will have gone up lets say 400% by then and would be more profitable than BTC right?

Didn't really mean to shit on you or anything just wanted the other users here to be careful and cautious before sending any money based on previous experiences here. If everything you're saying is true then I wish you luck
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:50:58
Let's be real. Bitcoin just doesn't work for your everyday transaction right now. I think that is what the original OP meant. Does this mean it doesn't have any usage at all? No, it does not but it's true that it's not a very efficient payment method for your everyday purchases especially for people living in 1st world countries with far better options.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:48:53
wait that's insane which one was that?
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:17:39
maybe you'll probably get downvoted for your views but don't think they ban
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:55:40
Only US? Oh and didn't blockchain do the same with XLM? Haven't checked out either as I don't intend to do KYC anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:28:16
Well it's not like they love bch either
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:20:02
Don't forget wikipedia. Think they've been in trouble lately.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:30:14
What was the post about? I mightve clicked
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:07:23
Can't believe someone like this isn't well known within the community yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:12:02
Where? There's so many places i can type something and it's confusing the hell out of me
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:16:49
"Then, you can safely use your old private keys to transfer your bcash (Bitcoin Cash)."
What old private keys? That's my question. How do I turn the 12 word backup phrase into private keys?

Lightning wallets are for small amounts? Can you explain
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:06:51
These tips add up to quite a lot for him. Look at his post history. We've seen multiple Redditors from Venezuela make these kinds of posts and I don't blame them. What is little money for most of us is a lot for them.
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:48:33
I don't see how your comment shows it's for small amounts? I've already downloaded the lightning labs wallet. I guess I'll go ahead and try. My parents actually own a business which would be fun to have them accept Bitcoin but might be a bit with taxes and all that official stuff that I don't know anything about
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:47:13
Have you checked out the lightning app? I have downloaded it and it goes through the paper seed thing as well isn't that what you mean by you owning the coins? Either way had no idea lightning would be that easy and cheap. Will have to check it out. I've been using ledger for all transactions
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:02:58
I thought I had seen this before. This all you're posting?
@_date: 2019-08-12 09:19:36
Doge to the moon?
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:27:57
I think that's a weak argument to get Bitcoin. Makes it sound like it has value because it's limited when I know you know it has other uses. Although you did say utility so maybe that was wrong of me. Either way, I'm still worried like a lot of anti-BTC people about this very thing. Because it's limited people are hodl'ing in hopes of it growing in value but not using it as a currency (as it was intended to) meaning a lot of the people are in this for a purpose matching that of a pyramid scheme. Been a while since I researched Bitcoin so if anyone could sum up all the uses for BTC/blockchain that would be nice.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:39:23
makes sense thanks for explaining.
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:11:32
Now correct me if I'm wrong because now I'm just assuming how things work but can't they just exchange their currency to say USD or whatever and then convert it back? That's basically the same as storing it in BTC. I mean obviously, you just gave me one example but would like to hear some more real-world uses. Feels to me that the majority in this subreddit only speaks positively about it because they are in it for their own gains moneywise. Well not like I'm here browsing all the time and researching but does feel that way to me.

Damn. And South Korea were one of the countries I thought was the most intellegent making peace with North Korea and shit

This is one of the few that changed my mind about paper wallets. I had already read it before you linked it but thanks anyway. Basically this post is saying that paper wallets is not as safe as you would think and gives solution to make it safer. Even after reading this i'm still not sure if it's any good or not. By using his solutions it should be safe right? 
All I want to know is wheither paper wallets are more safer than desktop ones with the recovery phrase. Both have the con that your btc might get stolen because you have some sort of virus on your computer. I'm not worried about printing, sending, destroying or creating. All I want to know is which is safer
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:57:40
Not sure if you've read some of the other comments here. When you said "The 12 seed words on a piece of paper are essentially another kind of paper wallet." Another user recommended getting a wallet and then deleting it, only saving the phrase. So as you said it's another kind of paper wallet. I'm only looking to invest long term so wouldn't this be safer? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:36:40
So paper wallets is just the same as a desktop wallet? Since both can be hacked right? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:12:08
So what you're saying is I should use either Mycelium or copay? I've used copay before but haven't really used mycelium. 
With what you've said I'm thinking about putting all my money that I have in my paper wallet in copay and then uninstalling it right? Or is there a way to actually delete the wallet itself and not the program? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:18:31
Oh so this way you can save them up without any risk of getting hacked or anything? Genius 
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:08:03
Yes to what?
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:11:57
So basically just use a normAl wallet as long as it's not an exchange?  "You can now delete the wallet and restore it to regain access to your funds at anytime in the future." What do you mean by this though?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:16:10
Just not sure if it's worth the fees. It is password encrypted or the BIP38 thingy. I know it's insecure but how exactly? 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:16:42
Would it make sense to use their name but at the same time use my mastercard?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:16:10
can you report fraud on localbitcoins?
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:57:26
Been googling for sites like these for a long time but only found localbitcoins. Ty
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:45:01
How?
