@_date: 2018-09-11 01:04:12


Jimmy has talked about the format in public multiple times. I don't believe that Roger was not informed as this is how the debate was promoted, as an actual debate such that Roger could not just interupt as per usual.
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:09:26
Yes, the whole point of the debate was to have a debate where one person talks then the other responds, Roger likes to interrupt and shout over the other person and as you can see he tried this tactic and Jimmy was like go fuck yourself and Roger capitulated and came off as weak and unprepared. Jimmy took the high road and smoked him.
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:47:17
Because Roger is the worst, showed up unprepared, and spewed incohesive incoherent arguments.

Roger claims and promotes a scam coin as Bitcoin on his website. Call it Bcash and no one would care, you can't call Toyota the real Lamborgini 
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:39:22
The debate was between Bitcoin and Bcash not to wax philosophical. We all agree about the need for Bitcoin, and by doing so he tried to paint Jimmy as not agreeing with the sentiment, but Jimmy had already said earlier about how he admired Roger for his philosophy in the early years. If we are scoring the debate Roger got his ass beat.
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:53:48
No he was telling the audience the format playing the part of the moderator (which there should have been), and prior to a debate the mod asks both sides if they agree with the rules, this is the protocol have you never seen a debate? Also why the hell would Roger agree to a debate without a format?

I understand what you are saying, but the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of individuals are technically illiterate and this is a huge barrier to entry. The first step towards mass adoption is custody solutions because people will lose their Bitcoin and then get pissed and leave. Custodial solutions from banks by banks that already hold their money serves as a great introduction to how and why it works without having to do the research themselves bc they won't. But then after some time, they will realize they don't need the bank and will leave or force the banks to change and offer new better services.

Jimmy was assuming the duty of the Moderator (WHY NO MOD???) which is to explain the format to the audience, then by protocol it was his turn to speak. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:49:08
Did he?? He took like 30sec in his initial rebuttal, for which he had 10min. He lost right there. Then rambled about shit that was not relevant to the debate. We all agree that Bitcoin is the future and why it is needed. The debate was Bitcoin vs. Bcash and Jimmy posited that Bcash is centralized garbage and laid out his argument for 10min, Rogers response was "a subreddit is mean to me."

I am a climate scientist. The energy is used to create and secure the network, but wouldn't the direct monetization of energy incentivize state actors to seek out the cheapest form of energy (renewables) by building out the green infrastructure? In a similar way to how coal built out the rail infrastructure or petroleum built out the highway infrastructure, Bitcoin and POW will build out the green infrastructure. Energy use is not the problem and will always increase, it's energy production that is the problem. The carbon credit system uses money to disincentivize energy use but as a voluntary system that is unenforceable globally it falls flat in the third world, Bitcoin is a system that third world countries will actively seek out to help stabilize their economies without compromising sovereignty which will naturally lead to mining and green infrastructure.
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:25:21
New power installations (coal, wind, solar, etc.) are built estimating the power needs of the community in 15-20 years, so a 50MW plant is built in an area with 15MW current demand. For renewable installations, you can't simply turn them off like you can just produce less with carbon-based sources. So by mining, you can have your 50MW solar installation (or launch a rental program with a monthly "service charge") and recoup losses and expenses quicker.

Yes, so why instead of issuing debt to the richest among us, why not just give an UBI to the people. The banks will still get the money when people deposit it, so they can fractional reserve it.

Mining profitability is from the marginal cost of the energy source not the initial infrastructure cost. Renewable infrastructure is expensive but the marginal cost per KWh is ~nothing. Fossil fuels have cheap infrastructure costs but high marginal costs per KWh. This is why Bitcoin mining is 75% renewable-powered and will continue.

Socialism is very different from communism, for that matter neither Nazism or Stalinism is communist (as they both have a government) or socialist (being authoritarian dictatorships and all), it just turns out that following the french revolution the new government gathered meticulous data on wealth and capital.

It won't change that much, but it will cut down on tax avoidance by the rich, corruption, and embezzlement as the larger the account the harder it is to hide in the blockchain. No more $1,000,000,000,000 getting lost in the middle east without record, no more off-shore tax havens, and no more 1MBD shenanigans.

u/roasbeef you are my hero and 4 years younger. Great job, oh and if you see this I started a small Lightning development business and we think we have found a way to bring the LN to mass adoption. I would love to discuss with you and get your opinion on our security model.

Bingo, by distributing the coins into legitimate society do you ban all of the coins or none of them and how?
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:45:14
The move would be to distribute all the coins to random wallets of real people (Robin Hood kine) then a bunch to themselves and their friends with legit wallets.

Hi Emiliano,
Not a finace guy (working on masters in Chemical Oceanography) but great paper. I am working on a paper about how Bitcoin could function as an incentive for a green energy industrial revolution. But when I approach economists they are dissmisive (and rude) and refuse to even read the abstract. As I am not an economist I need an economist to co-author, Do you have any advice for how to approach the topic or any individuals that might like to colaborate?

This is the conclusion of a paper I am writting:
As more people in the developing world start interacting with the internet they will quickly see the need to send and receive money over it. This will cause them to seek out a solution and for all the reasons described they will converge on Bitcoin as it is the only viable option. It is the need for Bitcoin in the developing world that will cause them to move quicker than the 1st world in adoption, as the 1st world already has a functioning system flawed and aging as it is. Additionally, if we keep the assumptions for adoption and thereby price, an increasingly valuable currency is far more attractive than a currency that is decreasing (such as what many developing countries have now often at very high rates) or stagnant (ex. M-Pesa).  Adoption by the people out of necessity will force their governments to action, some may adopt some will try to ban, while a dictator can slow adoption by banning it. Bitcoin is impossible to ban due it’s decentralized properties, for the same reason the USA couldn’t ban encryption or file sharing despite the best efforts of our leaders. If a dictator tries to ban Bitcoin and your family has it, you can simply leave without fear of confiscation and flee to a country that has adopted Bitcoin, and if you can’t bring your family yet you can permissionlessly send funds to them beyond the reach of the despot. This creates another incentive mechanism for developing Nations to adopt faster as well, to attract and retain wealth. The addition that
Bitcoin, at high levels of adoption, is a far more stable money than anything a government can print will also be attractive to both individuals and Governments. Bitcoin will allow families to start acquiring generational wealth leading to the emergence of a global middle class. As families start to acquire Bitcoin, inevitably their governments will as well for their currency reserves. To acquire more they must mine Bitcoin which will incentivize them to build renewable energy infrastructure to produce the energy to mine without having to deal with the logistics and price uncertainty of fossil fuels. Being able to pay for that infrastructure faster by mining will allow them to build more which will allow them to mine more or maintain the same share of the total global hash rate. 
Just as coal/petroleum (energy source) led to the build out of the rail/road (Means of Transportation MoT) infrastructure through an incentivized positive feedback loop. By stabilizing the economies of the developing world and incentive mechanisms, inherent to the proof of work competition, Bitcoin as a Mot will lead to the build out of renewable energy infrastructure and provide a new model for industrialization in the developing world.

Yes, they hold your money for you and have some protection from theft. But I don't see it as a bad thing, you have the choice to use them or not no one is forcing everyone to use them like we are forced to use a bank in order to get access to online payments. Many people are not ready to manage their own keys and many will never be, lack of skills. As long as they are transparent and honest I support them because it is optional.

I don't know. With their current push towards a privacy and security-oriented customer service business, it might make sense to use Bitcoin over their own which would have to be BSA compliant.

Enrironmental Scientist, Geochemist, checking in. I am working on the Envirnmental Case for Bitcoin and POW. Some quick points: Energy use is not the problem it's how is the energy produced. Bitcoin/POW incentivizes the use of the cheapest energy, and fossil fuels can't compete with green tech (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, OTEC, wave, etc.) for much longer. Competition for mining power will lead to proliferation of green energy infrastructure across the globe as mining can be participated in from anywhere, think space race except for remaking the energy grid. Inflation requires continuous growth in consumption, resource use, and enviromental exploitation, deflation may alow growth without increased consumption. The US is dragging it's feet with climate action because of ties to Saudi Arabia and Oil pricing in dollars and because the Oil infrastructure was built with loans that need to be paid back (politicians on the take from banks and oil companies), weakening oil reliance = weakening the dollar and potential default on loans from outstanding debt, Bitcoin/POW can weaken oil and the banks expediating the transition. I'm not done with my idea yet, comments?

Each individual would contribute computation power (tax) to a collective organization governed by consensus (gov). The body uses the funds (block reward and fees) to support social benefits (healthcare, UBI, infrastructure, war) but if the governing body has to choose between war and a hospital (can't print more money) they either have to increase hash power of the collective organization (raising computational tax) or not go to war because hopefully the political fallout and the ability to vote through the blockchain would provide a consensus on how to apportion funds and unless a majority of the people found that the war was nessisary it would not happen.
