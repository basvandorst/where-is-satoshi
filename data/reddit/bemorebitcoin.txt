It's a second layer solution. Ugly but it works.
@_date: 2019-11-10 07:53:38
 has a few options, depending on what you need.

[BeMoreBitcoin](  you can see live prices, though it’s UK and there can be additional fees but will give you a few ideas I hope!
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:54:22
And the price/development is increasing.

Broken record but you can compare here,

It's hard, you could get to a life changing sum of money, then the question is do you cash out, how much do you cash out, and the tax implications. Maybe you need 2xs a life changing sum of money, cash out half, pay your tax and hopefully the other half in bitcoin keeps rising.

Nice work!
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:29:18
Long term upwards is as much as I can predict!

Small changes in the balance between buyers and sellers can cause big swings is how I see it. So like if you have 10 buyers selling an apple and 10 apple buyers it's all good ��  more person wanting an apple and the price rises until 1 person won't go for it. So easy to get 20% increase quickly with 5-10% change in buyers/sellers.

Zoom out ;) there's definitely media that only reports the drops, not sure if that is because more people read it or because that's the narrative they want to go for.

Peter Schiff even if he knows can't change his view, at least not without a lot of decoupling.

Nice to see "buy bitcoin" also increasing, people looking to get back in the game.
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:23:47
 
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:40:04
I dont think so, there's too many different types of people/businesses interested and involved now, and they are still in the development stages.

Post your public key to your electrum wallet and someone might send some bitcoin across. 
No need to buy an hardware wallet if you are just learning first.

If it's like that we might never get to the millions.
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:24:57
More and more talk of bitcoin hitting the millions and everytime it's said it's getting less absurd.
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:49:00
Looks good, will the white get dirty with finger prints or what's the material?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:57:32
The bigger the dip the more chips you can put in.
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:23:21
Agreed, just would need to figure out what's the most fun work.

Revelout card or Coinbase Pro people talk about, Coincorner as well gets a mention.

bemorebitcoin.com/buy lists rates
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:27:06
In the past when price went up, more people came to the sub. If there is a big event there is a spike, but we aren't seeing that at the minute. Price effects subnumbers rather than the other way around.
@_date: 2019-04-21 20:41:22
In the UK you can check bemorebitcoin.com for current prices.

Start of 2018 when value was high, high transactions there was a lot of users online on this sub, now transactions are high, value up significantly this year but we aren't seeing users coming back? Maybe the price pushed more by institutions rather than many smaller buyers.

I'm not sure if someone said the subnumber would impact price but generally subnumber can reflect popularity of a topic for users of reddit.
@_date: 2019-04-21 20:59:12
If you are UK check bemorebitcoin.com for the current rate.

Just trying to say a parabolic rise doesnt mean a parabolic or even accelerating increase in interest.
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:13:15
100% but it does show interest from reddit users over time, it looks like the price increase isn't related to the type of people who visit reddit, or what you think?
@_date: 2019-09-14 18:25:10
This is gentlemen.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:57:04
Wonder was filmed before or after the recent rise?
