I thought the beauty of bitcoin was not having to rely on a magnetic strip and 4 digit code. 
I would gladly take my strong password protected bitcoin wallet on my encrypted cell phone over that.

There is a bet and there is what's right. IMO we can end the gox effect right now if we all just step back from that shit company.

Set up 2fa on your wallet then uninstall Google authenticator. It's a pain to regain access.

By the time it's released in the fall Asic will be king and GPU will be obsolete.

BFL is only shipping jalapenos at this time. No SC singles or minirigs have left their facility yet.

Still have the hard drive? You might try some data forensics on the drive to see if it's recoverable. The odds are slim but stranger things have happened and if you become a millionaire send some my way :). 
I can help if you want to send me the drive.

Here's the math I am working with. 
There are around 60k orders for BFL. I estimate the average order will produce an additional 25 gh/s to the total network. This is my gut feeling and might be wrong. 
If we multiply the 60k orders times an average of 25gh/s we get 150 th/s of additional total network processing. I am going to double that to 300 th/s because there are other asic chip makers. 
Over the next few months I estimate we are going to bring 300th/s of processing power to the btc network. Currently we have 132th/s this gives us 432th/s total. Difficulty is currently 15m, if the ratio of processing power to difficulty is reasonably linear (I am not sure how this is calculated I assume a linear ratio). This gives us a difficulty of 50m. Many other people are assuming 350m difficulty which is a good assumption to go by if you are thinking about mining hardware. A 350m difficulty assumes that 3ph/s will be released onto the market giving a total hashrate of 3.1ph/s.  
12.5 block switch is years away so we don't have to factor that in. 
The best bet is to read as much as you can on the emerging trends and don't play with money that you can't afford to lose.

I am order number 37xxx and I ordered in early april. 
I have seen order numbers on ebay in the 60,xxx for recent orders. I have a hard time believing less than 25k

I bought high but I still believe in the currency. I have my btc in my wallet and if it drops to 0 tomorrow I am fine with that. 
It's well worth the under $1k I tossed into it for me to say that I was here at the real early growth spurts of an internet backed currency. 
I feel like I am a part of history and that, to me, is worth the cost of admission. 
If I had put anything more than my gambling fund into it I might be concerned.

150 KH/s is pretty good, typically you want to keep your gpu temp under 80C. 
The difficulty for Doge is pretty low, I get 12k/day
