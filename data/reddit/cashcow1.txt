Basically, the only current limits on federal power are restrictions on violating the civil rights of individuals (1st Amendment, etc.)
There are very few effective limits to the Commerce Clause, Taxing Power (Sebelius). Essentially, the 10th Amendment is nearly meaningless at this point.

Read the dissent in Lopez, too. They basically come right out and say Congress can do anything they want under the Commerce power, and the only check on that power is political (i.e. elect other representatives).

That's the alleged point. But in reality, most law professors are decidedly politically liberal, and many seek to indoctrinate students into their views of the law.
Furthermore, much time is wasted on information that is not important to the practice of law. Source: ask any partner at a law firm if 1st year associates can tell their ass from a hole in the ground.

Can confirm. Am in law school. Most of con law is obtuse explanations of why the federal government can do whatever the hell it wants, and why citizens don't really have rights.
Examples: Wickard, Terry, Prouse

I'm in law school. Right now. I just got out of Con Law, and the prof talked about his expansive views on the Commerce Clause, Taxing power, etc.
Literally just sat through it.

You're shifting scope a bit here. I said that many profs are trying to indoctrinate, and thus not fulfilling the stated purpose of trying to make good lawyers.
Your objection (they won't be successful) doesn't directly address my argument.
