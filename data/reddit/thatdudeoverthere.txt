It's literally been over a month and I haven't been verified on bit stamp. Every time I log in, it says I need to verify, then i click the link and it tells me about the 2 week wait. I'm about to hit 45 days of verifying my info on bit stamp 
So Please. Tell me why coinbase is so bad. Everyone that is interested in crypto I will tell them to go there because in less than a week they can be trading  And don't say trade fees are expensive because its well known by now how to avoid fees

Ok so trezor does support bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin. 
But how do you separate them? Man I did not pay enough attention to the post at the top of the page explaining all this

I need help.

Damn this shit is complex. How safe is coinbase? I need to read and figure this stuff out a bit better. I definitely jumped in before I understood what I'm doing with crypto currency. But it's not like I re financed my house and threw it all in...it was more download the coinbase app and a couple bucks and see what happens

Ok I'm confused again. Can I use a single trezor wallet for bitcoin, ethereum, and lite coin all at once?

Im right there with you op...i just joined the club with 500 bucks today at 6396 per bitcoin. 
To be clear on the buying bitcoin way is, coinbase,trezor,gdax,trezor, celebrate? I think. I'm trying. Please be nice :) 
I mean coinbase we start with, learn gdax, keep our bitcoin safe on trezor, then we high five each other..i have much to learn..thank you for this sub Reddit!

So I bought small amounts of bitcoin, ethereum, and lite coin. And a trezor wallet. 
I bought it all through coinbase. Now I just transfer it all to trezor correct? Then I bury trezor in my back yard?
