thats too complicated. has to be more simple than that. people don't use prediction markets as is. you can't expect more people to use them if there is an extra step in the process.

If its denominated in bitcoin its not going to take off

Here is a direct quote from Dan Larimer (bytemaster) the lead developer of the bitshares toolkit and CEO of Invictus Innovation:

i agree that what bitshares is trying to do is unprecedented and is highly experimental. but it is important to understand that bitcoin is of the same nature. it took a while for people to understand how bitcoin worked and how it fit in the economic scheme of things. i think this is the same issue that plagues bitshares. only time will tell what will happen with bitcoin and bitshares but i would have to argue that having looked at the economics behind the bitshares concept, it looks a lot better than the economics behind bitcoin.

Yes. Delegates (the transaction processors in the DPoS model) can set the percentage of fees that they are going to keep and the percentage of fees that they are going to destroy, which acts as an implicit dividend to shareholders. Because being  delegate is such a competitive position you can expect that shareholders will vote for those delegates that burn the most shares or add the most value to the ecosystem with the proceeds from the fees they collect.

am i the only one that thinks that 21 is dumb and that investors are wasting their money on it? mining is a bad investment, whether you think its necessary for distributed consensus or not. i wish more investors would put more money into creating better blockchain protocols as opposed to putting their money into companies that rely on a blockchain network that hasn't even been optimized to process transactions other than transferring an arbitrary asset.  
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:51:29
i don't think thats accurate considering ethereum, ripple, bitshares all have greater functionality and more efficient transaction processing
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:24:22
you can only compromise pow networks with hardware. ripple and bitshares can't be compromised with $1m in hardware. thats one of the reasons why they present a better alternative to bitcoin. ripples consensus process is centralized and managed by ripple labs and bitshares consenus process requires obtaining enough stake in the network to control 51% of the transaction processors (or delegates). this would take more than $2.5m in investment in bitshares, which would subsequently bid up the price of bts dramatically if done all at once. if the network is compromised then the community could just fork the network start again, while the $2.5m investment of the 'attacker' would be sunk. you can't just pivot the network in this way with pow blockchains because then you need to find another hashing algorithm that the "attacker" doesn't have hardware for.

It is important to understand that all of these systems, including bitcoin, rely on trust. Miners can filter out transactions as well as double spend. And now because so many miners have delegated their hashing power to pools the users of the bitcoin network must trust the mining pools. With BitShares that trust is delegated in a more direct way without requiring the economic cost of waisted computational resources. Through Delegate Proof of Stake the network can be optimized to be comparably efficient as a single centralized server. This is key for the user experience and will ultimately lead to greater adoption of crypto-equities and crypto-currencies.

The best platform to raise funds would probably be bitshares. 
You can create an asset and sell it on the blockchain for USD. The value of the funds you raise is pegged to the dollar so you don't lose money if the price of BTC or BTS fall. 
here's a good overview of the advantages of bitshares for funding

bitcoins not scalable relative to other solutions that are currently in the market. its not about whether or not bitcoin becomes more scalable, but whether it becomes more scalable relative to those other competing payment networks
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:57:37


Thats why you can peg to other currencies or commodities (or really anything that we can collectively come to consensus on the value of).


It can be backed on and by the block chain with the network's reserve currency. The block chain is more or less incorruptible, which is why we need more of our financial interaction on chain as opposed to off.

I'm doing a similar analysis of the applications for blockchain technology in the exchange industry. 
There's no difference between Nasdaq managing cap tables on the blockchain vs a private ledger. Nasdaq is trying to see how efficiently they can manage property rights on the blockchain. Since Nasdaq is the only company that needs to have access to information from their private markets, a proprietary database works best. However, when dealing with markets for which multiple companies/agencies need access to the transactions, a publicly shared database can be more efficient. 
If you are looking for blockchain companies/projects that allow users to issue their own assets on a blockchain look at [BitShares]( The team behind it is focused on consolidating the functionality of an exchange on to a blockchain. Their blockchain prototocol allows user to issue assets as well as create their own collaterized derivative products. All financial instruments on the BitShares blockchain can be exchange for one another on the blockchain and transaction confirmation occurs every second. There are a variety of improvements that BitShares makes to the blockchain protocol to make it more applicable to heavily regulated financial industry.

To say that newer block chains stifle innovation is false. These block chains provide innovative solutions to bitcoins short comings. A database which is what the blockchain is should be permissioned by role. That's how database are kept secure. 
Bitcoin doesn't really have trust through computation. That notion relies on the false ideology of bitcoin being decentralized, which the economics of mining doesn't allow for. I may trust the protocol will only permit the miners or pools with the greatest hashing power to produce blocks, but I can't say I entirely trust those miners and pools will not utilize their power to undermine the integrity of the network. 
I've stopped listening to AA. He idealises bitcoin far too much.

This is probably the best article that addresses how a decentralized exchange will ultimately work and what place centralized exchanges will have in the future

This is why Bitshares was created, to demonstrate that fixed income securities could be collateralized on the blockchain so users don't have to trust that a third party IOU is redeemable by any centralized gateway. I think Bitshares has proved that stable crypto currencies with no counter-party risk can work well even if the collateral is falling in value as we have seen over the past 6 months. Just like people were slow to realize the advantages of bitcoin they are slow to realize the advantages enforcing other trust based transactions on the blockchain.  In the next couple of years I believe that blockchain enforced and collateralized IOUs will become ubiquitous and easily traded on the blockchain itself.

ok great, so you'll add $10 - 20 of sell pressure a week. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 18:00:03
That not true at all. Bitcoin is one implementation of blockchain technology. When people say they don't like Bitcoin, its because they see where this technology can go and already has. Bitcoin's blockchain will need to be faster, more scalable and include more operations if it is going to be competitive in the future. Personally, I'm sick of people looking at bitcoin as anything more than just a proof of concept for blockchain technology. Bitcoin is not the be all and end all of this industry. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:13:58
I have not lied about a single thing. I don't think you know much about bitshares, or for that matter blockchain technology. If you did you wouldn't cling to bitcoin as the solution to a "trustless" digital payment network. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:39:58
Bitshares (blockchain based securities exchange, 10 second transaction confirmation, $0.001 transaction fees, no waisted computational resources through mining, fungible futures contracts that allow for the creation of stable crypto currencies (market pegged assets), the collateral of which can be seen in real time and is in excess of 200% the contracts face value. User issued assets that can be traded against these market pegged assets on the decentralized exchange. Literally every issue with bitcoin is solved by bitshares (transaction fees, centralization of block production, transaction confirmation rate, stable crypto currencies)
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:41:36
You can also convert BTC to [BitUSD]( BitShares is developing a [mobile wallet]( that does this.

Coinbase wont be around in 5 years. A payment processor shouldn't need another payment processor. We need to first enhanced the block chain before we talk about building services on top of it. "Altcoins" serve that purpose. They innovate where bitcoin does not.
