For what it's worth... I am the owner of *snip*, which accepts Bitcoin &amp; carries all/most major Vaporizers.
I'm a long-standing Bitcoin supporter &amp; have been happily serving the vape community for the last year. Long live the forward-thinkers :)

I've never heard it explained like this. I didn't understand your first line until I'd read the whole post nad *re-read* that first line, but I think you nailed it.
The worry of counterfeiting coins comes from the system we currently have. BitCoin is a modern system that doesn't have that silliness. Math can't lie.

Cool. Thanks for responding.

Cool! Please do, I'd love to know who it is. 
Since the o's are stylized I know they're somewhat versed in lettering/typography. Crypto and graffiti/lettering... two passions!

Can you post the image with artist credit?
Your shot cuts off the signature, looks like *"GA..."*

Serious question, do you consider this *destruction* or *damage*?

Here you say newer iOS8 devices are immune but in another comment you said Apple *can* decrypt it. 
You seem knowledgeable (and not a troll) so I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding something.
* If they *can't* decrypt it (my understanding), is this just a case of posturing? 
* If they *can* decrypt it, then how are newer devices immune? 
Please excuse my ignorance, I'm not trying to be annoying.

That's an accurate description. Watch the documentary and it'll all make sense haha.

For archival purposes, [here's a screenshot of the original post]( and here it is typed out:
 
 Not Deposit To Cryptsy – Gone Full MtGox
It all started back in April when Cryptsy made the awful mistake of accepting control of a Paycoin prime controller. We warned our readers that Cryptsy decided to take part in a blatant scam and that you should withdraw your coins and never touch cryptsy again. You can read more about it here: [Cryptsy Becomes Part Of The GAW / Paycoin Scam](
Since then it seems that either Cryptsy got scared of not following federal AML and KYC regulations or the SEC investigaton of Josh Garza and the Paycoin fiasco brought the Feds to Cryptsy headquarters, because now many customers have had their funds frozen or were locked out of their account and are unable to withdraw coins.
In order to make a withdrawal you need to sell your soul to Cryptsy aka provide them with ID, SSN, Address, etc. Cryptsy is not the first to request such invasive information however, they are the first to not allow withdrawals for users who do not want to provide such information. This behavior is criminal and it looks like a class action lawsuit is the only option left for affected customers.
A quick look at the Scam Accusations category reveals a [10 page thread]( where customers are helplessly asking for information or help in order to get their funds back. Cryptsy has failed to solve any of these customer’s issues and has kept providing excuse after excuse as to why the withdrawals are not working.
One of the most hilarious excuses as to why withdrawals stopped working was due to the Bitcoin Malleability attack, posted by BigVern himself:


— BigVern ( October 6, 2015
We all know the only issue the BItcoin Malleability attack caused was unconfirmed duplicate transactions that may have clogged some wallets. A simple reset would have fixed the issue with no problems, however 3 weeks later withdrawals are still broken, and the malleability attack is long over.
Furthermore, instead of solving the PR crisis Cryptsy is currently experiencing and solving the issues with their customers they decide to roll out a Cryptsy Prepaid Mastercard – like we don’t have enough prepaid bitcoin cards already.
Do YOU have a pending withdrawals from cryptsy that is not going through? Are you locked out of your account? Let us know in the comment section so that others won’t have to loose their precious coins to a broken exchange. If you liked this article don’t forget to follow us on twitter

Pretty cool, considering the largest roadblock the community has right now is the lack of places to spend BitCoin. It will take a few forward thinking companies like these guys to get the ball rolling. After that it's a slippery slope for the USD.
