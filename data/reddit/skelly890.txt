I use bitcoin for actual purchases.
These are usually fairly big ticket items, and the fees aren't too bad when compared to the profits I've made.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:44:50


Bought at around $1k and can confirm that I just took some profits.   
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:10:41
I would (don't have a problem with anyone taking whatever - it's their body) but I had a blood clot related event a few years ago and don't want to risk a stroke.  Because that would truly suck monster donkey balls.

These days I don't take drugs but I can thank them for persuading me to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:50:29
I bought 1BTC at an average of about $1K (over time) and traded my way up to about 1.7BTC, but have been spending coin on desirable consumer goods since it rose about 4x, and have about 1.25 BTC worth of crypto remaining in a varied portfolio.
Because I've already covered my initial investment I'm essentially playing with free money and can afford to lose it, so if it hits $8k - and I think it's going down to &lt;$2k - I'll probably spend about 0.25, hold 1 and see what happens.  I'll keep some because there are few other investments which have the potential for moon type gains. 
But if it, say, doubles over the next couple of months I'll spend some more. I use crypto profits to buy huge upgrades on stuff that I'd buy anyway, but I make sure I put the equivalent  fiat amount I would have spent into a savings account.
Example:  I wanted/needed some new headphones. So instead of spending about $150 on a consumer grade set, today I spent about $600 on studio grade Beyer's, and put $150 into a boring old savings account.
These are fun, windfall gains, and I'm treating them as such.  I never expected this, so why not enjoy them now, leaving some so I get to indulge lottery winning fantasies without the expense or idiocy of buying lottery tickets?
Edit:  I might think differently if I had 10 bitcoins, but I don't have 10 bitcoins because I could not afford to lose $10,000 when I bought bitcoins...
Bonus edit:  There is very little chance of me sinking any *more* fiat into bitcoin or any other crypto.  I got lucky.  I hope other people get lucky.  I hope it goes to the moon, and if it does I'll still have skin in the game, but if it doesn't I've lost nothing.

There are trading fees but they're a percentage, so you can trade with extremely small amounts to practice.  A bit like playing cards for pennies.  (Though YMMV with withdrawal fees)
So you can put ten dollars or pounds or whatever worth on the exchange, trade with that, and multiply by a hundred in your head when you close the position.  You won't make or lose very much (unless you get lucky on the crazy, ultra volatile, small cap coins) but it's fun.
And obsessive...  I gave up after I spent hours chasing a ten dollar* loss.  :) 
*I live in the UK, but I think in dollars with crypto.

@_date: 2018-01-27 20:04:41
1. Open an account on an exchange.
2. Learn the interface.  What the charts are showing.  [Limit orders.](  and so on.
3. Put up some of the crypto you're *really* willing to lose.  Doesn't have to be very much. A few dollars/pounds/yen worth.
4. Get yourself in tune with the ebbs and flows of the market.
5. Keep up with the crypto news, and think how that will affect prices.  Example: it's the middle of the day in your country, but it's 2.00am on the American based exchange you use.  You read an article that says ebay is going to accept Bolloxcoin.  You double check and it looks like it might be true.  So you buy lots and lots of Bolloxcoin before everyone else wakes up.
6. Start small so you don't lose too much when you fuck up.
7. Profit. 
Edit:  Lots of people try day trading, but give up because they don't know they're doing and lose money.  But if you start with tiny amounts you can get yourself over that hump and make money from the new n00bs.
Bonus edit:  Oh, you were asking the OP.  Still, hope you find this useful.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:07:35
You're trading currency pairs in both forex and crypto.  If you can find your way around either you're good to go with the other, though the pairs are limited to certain currencies in the crypt market (depending on the exchange.)  You can't, for example, directly trade Ox for CLAMS, but would need to go via BTC, USDT, whatever.
Also, crypto has much higher volatility than forex so you don't necessarily need leverage to make or lose large amounts.

@_date: 2017-12-29 09:56:34
You know how you bought BTC with money you could afford to lose?
That goes double for trading, so only put the money you can afford to lose from the money you can afford to lose on the exchange.  Small trades at first until you get a feel for how the market ebbs and flows, and keep up with the news.
Good luck!

Tether [USDT](
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:07:17
UK here, so taxation system is different. If you show a profit and take it out of the exchange you're liable for capital gains, but trading is tax free up to that point.  So if you're a trader tether is extremely useful, as it allows you to temporarily exchange your crypto for the equivalent of dollars (handy if you think they're going to fall), avoid taxation, and not be hobbled by the glacial pace of exchange fiat withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:32:02
I don't see how it would make much difference.  It's not as if vast amounts of data are sent with each transaction, and they're not time critical unlike, say, low latency auto trading systems.

Personally, I think we'll hit $24K then correct down to $16K or so early January.  But I'm not confident enough to back that with money.  It's just a guess I pulled out of my arse, based on what my arse thinks about market sentiment.
Edit:  though if we hit over $22K I'll probably spend some.

As well as following the excellent suggestions from , you might care to get yourself a crypto news aggregator - for example, cointelegraph on android or cryptonews on apple - and read through them every day.  Some articles are bullshit, but you can make a lot of money on rumours, especially if you adjust your positions before most people on your exchange wake up in the morning.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:40:51
I haven't the faintest intention of buying or selling, but I looked at poloniex to see what the big boys are thinking.  And if someone is willing to punt approx $900,000 to buy in I'm assuming they've given it some thought.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:08:08
No one knows what will happen so why not buy $25 now and a further $25 later?  As I'm sure you're aware, bitcoin is a highly volatile investment, and that's one way of spreading the risk.

Diversify into the top (insert number of your choice here) market caps.  Occasionally some shitcoin will approach those levels because trading, so do some research first.   
I was discussing this with a friend the other day, and this is what he does:
*"Now I just tweak things so I always hold the top 25 or so coins (but not 'tokens') in rough proportion to their share of total market cap. I allow myself a *small* amount of wiggle room for my own opinions so e.g. have a handful % more* *XMR, ADA, Dash and a handful less % of some others, but otherwise its basically a self-administered index fund."*
I just hold BTC, XMR, ETH, BTH, and XRP, but I plan on picking up some Dash and LTC at some point.

They're useful for trading.
If you think BTC or Xcoin or whatever is going to fall against the dollar you buy tether, then exchange the tether for BTC if you think it's going back up.  
Saves you having to sell and buy back your BTC off the exchange, so getting around the transaction fees and time problem, and reducing your exposure to taxation (depending where you live, obv)
Edit:  down voted already?  Let me edit that to your satisfaction.

@_date: 2017-12-03 00:22:58
Am at the lower end of that age range and concur.  Right now my crypto holding are worth about 10x my initial investment/gamble. I paid back the original amount when they went up 5x and currently spend profits on tech. It's like a fun fund to me, and is used to buy stuff I wouldn't otherwise consider buying. But if we see another 4 - 10x increase at least 50% of that is going into low risk stock or government bonds.
Edit: If you're twenty by all means take a big chance - you'll have time to recover if it goes tits up - but if you're smart you'll put an equal amount in your pension.  Because compound interest.  And if you're thirty buy a house ffs.  Can't live in a BTX wallet.

At the sharp end some - but not all - in shop card readers were declining transactions.  So when I tried to pay for my groceries my card was declined twice and I was directed to another till.

 It's his business what he does with his coins but some general advice along the lines of if you're going to sell, send 0.001 coins first to make sure everything is as it's meant to be, then slowly ramp up wouldn't be amiss.  Along with keep at least 50/don't keep them on an exchange etc :)  Also, it's been a while since I've traded but winding off a 100+ coin position might be better than attempting to dump the lot.

Depends what you mean by "topples."
Exceeds market cap?  Costs more per coin?  The latter is essentially meaningless because divisibility, while the former doesn't really matter; what matters as a whole is total market cap, which you can see here:
 
And plenty of coins have have faded into obscurity.  They're quite often de-listed. 
Like I said, BTX was first to market and lots of people have heard of it, but apart from those it's not really special.  And if people make more fiat from other coins, then what of it? 
I agree that a major fall in BTX would be sort of devastating - it's happened before - but not in the long term.  Crypto in general is here to stay.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:35:03
All I know about tether is that it is - or was - a convenient way of converting crypto into something that's pegged to the dollar without actually changing it to fiat.  Probably because taxes.
So if you were trading and thought the all coin market cap was about to fall you'd move into tether, then buy back in at the dip. And sometimes it made up a pair if you didn't want to go via something else.
Apart from that idk.  Sorry, can't help you there.

Cannot up-vote this enough.  Have been trying to spend on rl goods and it's a total pita. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:42:13
Am also concerned about insane transaction time and fees (over an hour + 4.7% last time I bought something) so this conversation is interesting to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:17:06
Yeah, if he sells he'll be liable for CGT in the UK.  I mentioned that at the same time as You. Will. Need. An. Accountant.
Pretty sure that bit sunk in.  Hope so.

ETH has gained 28% in the past week, while XMR has gained 16% (1% under BTX)
I happen to hold both of those, but you need to do your own diligence.
Standard advice is pick a few from the top ten or so caps, but again, that's entirely your decision.  
Edit:  What I am saying is that it's a good idea to avoid an all your eggs in one basket situation. Ask anyone who held Enron stock...  And no, I don't think BTX is going to do the crypto equivalent of that.
Bonus edit:  Downvotes already?  I don't mind, and this is the bitcoin sub so you'd expect fanbois, but be careful out there, hmm?

No, but they can advise him on any taxes.  Also, some banks can get a bit weird if huge amounts of cash are suddenly dumped into a pleb tier account.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:21:01
That's right.  He bought them way back when.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:28:11


True, but other crypto currencies are available.  Which is why you probably want to diversify your portfolio a little.  Sure, BTX was first to market, first to exist, and is the first token most people hear about, but there is no guarantee that it'll always be the leader.
Don't get me wrong here; I want it to succeed, but the 40% of my crypto holdings that *aren't* bitcoin have had even more spectacular gains in the last week.

I followed a PCA strategy when I was buying.  Worked pretty well.

Assuming you've printed it for your parents, swap some of the words around using a simple formula that is either easily remembered, or printed and kept in a different physical location. 
This is a shit tier encryption method, but will deter casual thieves.
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:10:05
Fair enough.  I've printed my seeds, split them into two parts and left them with different relatives who I trust not to steal from me.  Another option is to leave half the seed with your will/lawyer, and the rest with whoever.  There's always the PGP option that has been mentioned further up the thread, but as you'll need to trust someone with the password/phrase, splitting that might prove useful.
Edit:  ...to someone.  You obviously trust your parents, but I can imagine circumstances where sharing an access code between two parties might be a good idea.

Dunno why you've been downvoted for arithmetic.
Bought ETH late 2016.  I now have approx double the amount of total fiat value crypto holdings I'd have had if I hadn't bought ETH.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:34:20
Think about it @ $2200.  
Really think about it @ $1100
Buy @ $560
All subject to events at the time; if it's still falling steeply I'll wait.  Most I've ever owned is about 1.1 BTC.  Currently hold about 0.15 BTC in diverse crypto, but would like to own 1.0 again.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:40:03
I concur.  Lots of panic/FUD to go as yet.  No way of knowing if this is standard bearwhale manipulation or they've let it run away from them. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:12:22
Soggy is right about the panic selling, but there's nothing wrong with a little top cap diversification. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:36:08


So am I. Am also slavering nicotine addict. 
Get yerself a low ohm vape.  Works better if you give up the ciggies for 48 hours first then use it when the craving kicks in.
I actually *enjoyed* Chantix/Champix.  It gave me crazy, acid grade dreams.  Great fun, though nearly passing out if I picked something off the floor wasn't.  It also took all the fun out of alcohol, which sounds bad, but I was getting worried about my drinking so I took the opportunity to give that up as well.  
Obviously, I'm back on the nicotine in vape form, but no longer have a burgeoning drink problem.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:25:43


I've done this in the past.  Small, ATM limit amounts, a couple of days before payday to cover unexpected bills or direct debits.  They charged an immediate 3%, and regard an extended history of such behaviour as a credit risk.
Edit:  If I was crazy enough to buy BTC on credit I'd just take out a loan.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:40:25


Yeah.  I liked those.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:43:13
Reason 4: I just spent some.  Expect it to triple within the next week.
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:34:29
If in UK, [Scan]( take BTC.  I've encouraged them by always buying with coin there.
Edit: judging by the downvote, at least one person doesn't want BTC to be a thriving currency.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:16:56
If you put cash in the ATM it clears pretty fast.  Not immediately, but usually by the next banking day.

Dow: falls 4.6%

Tether's value derives from the fact that you can use it instead of going through the lengthy process of taking your money off the exchange.  So if you think all cryptos are going to fall and need to move fast, paying a small premium is acceptable.  Otoh, it's sometimes worth less than a dollar because you're taking a chance that it's not really backed by fiat.
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:05:42
 ignorance is so pervasive...
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:38:26


I really liked them...  See post a little bit further up the thread for details.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:05:14
Can confirm that all my sold BTC was profit taking.  I used it to buy desirable electronic consumer goods that I really wanted, but couldn't justify spending fiat on.  Am holding on to what I have left because I think it's bottomed out.
And yes, I know money is money, but it's easier to spend windfall cash than hard earned.

Can you claim a rebate on your total tax bill if you've suffered losses? 
Doesn't apply to me in any case because UK, but if you can it might help some late adopters out.

I've been waiting for a couple of weeks now...
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:45:43
OK.  I'm sure you realise this now, but for anyone else who is reading this it's a good idea to pay back your initial investment from profits (and/or set stop losses) as soon as they reach a certain point so you're playing with house money from then on in. You get to decide what that point is, but if the price is going parabolic and people who have no clue are buying in because fomo you really want to think about it.  You miss out on potential gains but the pressure is off and it becomes fun.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:06:36
I used to buy from bittylicious.  Paid more than other places - at about £600 per coin - but the transactions went smoothly enough.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:55:37


Sell a little.  Buy something you'd like but couldn't justify without free money. Techno toys, nice whisky, whatever. Then if it splats you have something you'd like, but if it moons you lose some but still have something you'd like.
This is all predicated on the "only buying crypto with money you can afford to lose and have no interest bearing debt" rules oc.
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:43:41


Spent 90% of my crypto on that and associated gear around January.  
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:59:52


Was there a reason you didn't pay the 40 back after you hit, say, 400 (or some other arbitrary number)?
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:54:35


Which is?  
Sure, it has utility, but there is no way of ascertaining its underlying  value. Especially as there are lots of other coins. And the main advantage it has over those is brand recognition.


Or 10x less worthy.
