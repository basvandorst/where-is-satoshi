I don't think them being experts on it deserves the outrage in this thread. few places are "expert" hubs for anything that is commonly discussed. are we supposed to be angry and defensive anytime someone talks about something they're not an expert about? They are at least a technology focused group commenting on tech. it's another opinion, thank goodness is not the only opinion we have.

That all explains it really well, thanks. It's just too bad, because it's not often something that leads to cracks and now everyone who is curious is going to come in and see (what appears to be) a bunch of raving madmen.

Which is the current disagreement.

This is beyond "sticking up", the way people are acting *reeks* of insecurity. I love bitcoin, but jesus, there's no semblance of discussion in here, it's literally a bunch of people yelling "shill" at anyone who disagrees and being really oddly childish about the thread. Painting everyone as a shill or how they don't understand so fuck 'em, and acting like there's no discussion to be had at all.
There's just a really pathetic air of ignorance in here. Like nobody is secure enough to face this issue (or non-issue, whatever) with anything other than conspiracy theories, anger, exclusion, and a reactionary puffing of their chests to remind the rest of the sub that "we are right and cool, there's nothing to fear".
I've honestly never seen anything like it.

I've never seen more defensiveness in my life that in this sub right now.
