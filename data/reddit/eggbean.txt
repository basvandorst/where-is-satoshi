Yes, loads of times.  Remember that you need to convert into EUR (or this is done automatically).
You probably don't have your EUR account activated. On the Accounts tab, press the funny icon at the top left corner and activate the EUR account.
You can send to Coinbase/DGAX just fine.  Remember to use the code that is given by Coinbase or GDAX (the other adyress details between the two are identical).

I don't believe in hodling, as I have the equivalent of around 30% more of bitcoin than I paid for, through day trading (swing and scalping) than I would have if I simply held, and that's after losing most of my gains.

But Cryptokitties has had a huge effect on the network performance.  If you are unaware of this, I doubt your knowledge in this regard.

There are some new types of banks now.  I've opened up a [Fire bank account]( which is based in Ireland and available to UK residents.  It gives you both GBP and EUR accounts.  You also open a [Revolut account]( which is a mobile app account where you can exchange various fiat currencies.
They also both come with debit cards with contactless payment.  The Revolut card is incredibly useful if you travel a lot, as you can exchange into various currencies very cheaply on the fly.  It's like the Uber of banking.
SEPA bank transfers are not immediate, but they are free with these new banks (SEPA transfers from traditional UK banks cost around £8 to £30+).  So, what I have done is put money into Revolut from debit card, exchanged to EUR at its very good rate, then transfered to Fire EUR account and used that to make a bank transfer to Coinbase or GDAX, which only accept bank transfers in EUR and it costs nothing (transfers out cost €0.15).
Revolut can also possibly transfer straight to Coinbase, but there are some old posts in its forum that mention that cryptocurrency exchanges are against its terms of use or something.  However, when I asked a human in the app's support tab, they said there was no problem now, but it took her some time looking up what Coinbase was.  I will have to make a small test transfer to make sure that is true before I transfer any large amounts.
Also, [Revolut are just about to bring BTC/LTC/ETH exchanging and wallets]( which is going to make everything much simpler.
I got the initial information on doing this a while back here on one of the other subreddits.

Why is that?
If you mean because of the tokens given, they will be sent to MyEtherWallet/MetaMask.

No, send from Revolut, as the SEPA transactions are free and the GBP&gt;EUR exchange rate is at market rate with no fees.  It's the Uber of banking.

I have been, over a week ago when transferring ETH to invest into an ICO.  The transactions were taking over 12 hours, however that may have been the exchange's fault, although they blamed the Ethereum network.

Cryptocurrency transfers.  Like ETH transfers have been taking many hours recently.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:49:40
Surely the transaction times makes this not viable.

With the lack of replay protection, isn't there a risk of you dumping BTC at the same time?  I've been reading/watching/hearing a lot of conflicting opinions on this.

Are you talking about European SEPA bank transfers?
