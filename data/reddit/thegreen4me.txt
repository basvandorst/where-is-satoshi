Go be triggered somewhere else. Nobody here cares about you virtue signalling.

wahhh! a website's owner has a different opinion on block size than me!
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:06:22
yea but koreans are mostly behind bitcoin cash because all the blockstream sponsored shill accounts only post in english.

basically, once the amount of $$$ the IRS has to gain from shaking you down exceeds the cost of having an extremely overpaid and incompetent government employee calculate exactly how much they can steal from you.

no, bitcoin core is not bitcoin, because bitcoin is a p2p electronic cash system, (as stated in the white paper) not a p2p store of value system.

It's going to be more than 10k, however personally I would not take that risk at 10k given the consequences, just in case I'm wrong.

no, theymos is plankton

I am prepared. Hodling my bitcoin cash.

Isn't it convienient how they just left out what size blocks you suddenly need an "expensive data center?"
Do the math yourself. (It's a LOT more than 8mb)

Noooooooo exmo was the best exchange ever!!! good thing I never held anything there and always moved everything to my own wallets instantly. The beauty of Bcash is that you can actually afford to protect yourself like that since TX fees are basically zero.

yea he was so close to hitting the nail on the head except he picked LTC instead of BCH
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:06:38
LOL can't wait for how dumb you feel in 3 months. RemindMe! 3 months
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:51:02
No it would just make you bankrupt yourself in transaction fees since "store of value" coin isnt intended to be moved anymore
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:25:13
Ripple is a scam because all transactions require approval from a centralized authority and that authority can arbitrarily print as many coins as they want.

My prediction:
BTC: 0
BCH: 50,000
