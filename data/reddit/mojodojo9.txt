You could say that... but I don't believe Amazon, Virgin, or parties of that caliber aren't really causing more harm than good to the US economy - meaning their business with cryptocurrencies are going to come with a fees which will then get taxed. The US can force a bunch of things... put it this way... many stream and torrent movies through the internet, while fully being aware of the "5 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine'. With that being said, the cryptocurrency could lead to the inevitable wild wild west (worst case scenario - it being in the hands of terrorists) however, I do believe a sheriff put in place wouldn't be a bad idea.

Fiat paper isn't the only purchasing power; As we're all aware majority of everyday consumers have tap on their credit cards.. which at the end of day only represents what amount value we have in the bank as numbers on a screen. With that being said, Bitcoin will vanish as soon as the confidence in its value vanishes...

Let the 10k cappers sell, there'll be a slight dip back down to 10,000 (from 11,000) and I recommend buying then

But that doesn't make your statements invalid. If your logic is backed by facts from the collective of knowledgeable professionals and/or panel of experts, it might result in many being in sync with your thinking and take it as food for thought.
Back to the point. I believe that blockchain's STRUCTURE/PLATFORM is the vehicle for crypto-currency, why? Because Blockchain as well as Bitcoin are just players. In the coming decade, so many more parties will venture into creating new crypto-currency entering different "blockchain" platforms - to the point where perhaps the only way to purchase a particular good, would be the exchange of 'X' crypto-currency backed by 'Y' projects (i.e. projects for electric cars or solar panel manufacturing, idk whatever). Keep in mind, some might fail, and others prevail (just as new businesses historical play out in modern capitalism). It's the fundamental support of *belief* in the growth of 'Y' projects that hold their crypto-currency value. Just as the value in fiat currencies are in play today; we *believe* in the value the dollar holds BASED ON the economic projection of the country/government to strengthen it. Now arguably, the difference between governments and parties entering new crypto-currency is the mindset as a whole - governments keep printing tender cash allowing inflation to arise, whereas if a new crypto-currency keeps adding to their cap, it will only hurt its own value. This is what makes crypto-currency as a whole revolutionary.

Recommending people to read articles and educate themselves is a clear indication of one's inability to summarize their knowledge through a collective and productive point. "Bitcoin is a combination of multiple ideas and technologies." is a valid point... do you care to elaborate? On the other hand, I believe crpyto-currency IS the combination of multiple ideas and technologies while Bitcoin is just a huge player with the same characteristics as you described. Like a massive company in an industry. i.e. What Boeing is to the aviation industry, (among many others).
