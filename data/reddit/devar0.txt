Pity the ATO now insists of purchases of BTC include a 10% GST. Bet coinjar is hurting from that.

I remember seeing the photos of the inside of that place and thinking "wow, where are all of the *things*? I mean, like, business things. It was a business, and it was just devoid of anything.

It's pronounced さとし. Hope that helps!

Any virus scanner worth it's salt would read it as en executable, fudging the extension only fools us poor humans.

Yup. Purchasing with bitcoin in insanely easy. The first time I did it I was blown away by the simplicity over using a CC.

I'd personally rather increase the blocksize and then look toward a solution that works long term.
One line of code vs thousands.

I don't feel that way. From all I have seen it is core that has decided to take bitcoin and change it to a settlement layer, where bitcoin cash is what the original bitcoin was and shall continue to be.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:08:51
And another.

There's another bitcoin sub you might like to check out if you want actual discussion.

Noone is privy to anyone elses private key in transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:10:27
Well, not that one then, is it. There is another.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:15:24
have they? the comments are removed.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:50:44
All the actual users got c-en-so-re-d. There's no point being here any more. It's nothing but an echo chamber. I unsubbed back in 2015, it's no longer a relevant discussion board, and other people wondering what the fuck happened to this sub should do the same thing.

The blocks are full. Core refuses to increase the block size, instead vying for a very complex "segwit" system. Instead of simply increasing the blocksize to 2mb, which was asked for over two years ago, we have stalled.

Oh how you see, they've got you arguing with yourselves so you have no time or energy to argue against them!
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:34:42
Just comparing responses in both subreddits.
I can easily see which one has the FUD. Whoa.
@_date: 2013-07-01 01:01:49
This is true! Now I like your system better!
*I think? In any case we pay a licensed car registration every year.

I actually thought you were joking. I can get the same kind of thing direct from the WA dept of transport for under $500!
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:49:12
Posts like these are the signal for lots of people to sell. Good work.
@_date: 2013-06-30 13:58:42
It's not available in WA now. I checked! Taken!
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:08:08
Probably missed the boat on BTC so he's pumping this.
