you buy a tv from someone with bitcoin
you receive the tv, its broken
you contact the seller
if the seller responds at all, he tells you to fuck off
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:20:24
then you call the property manager and tell them to hire someone to fix the elevator?

yeah, i never understood how buying gift cards with bitcoin equated to using bitcoin at that store
you're not buying stuff at target with bitcoin, you're buying a target gift card with bitcoin and using it at target
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:45:36
well they have the overhead involved in converting btc to cash to lose

i have a credit card from barclays, got it online no idea where the closest branch is to me.

you'll never convince most of the people here of that, they're paultards who think taxation is theft
even in bitcoinmarkets (a more measured community by most metrics) there was a discussion not too long ago about how to handle capital gains taxes and the amount of people advocating outright just not paying them was astonishing

people buy from companies because they think they're good
people invest in companies because they think it will make them money

you know new york is a big state right
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:01:53
why as a seller would i give you a discount for paying in bitcoin instead of absorbing the extra profits?
@_date: 2014-06-23 00:43:15
Its really not though, It's like saying you're spending Swedish kroner at target when you went to the bank and exchanged your kroner for dollars and then spend it at target

it's a mass marketing e-mail tool for sending identical e-mails to multiple users on a list, like mailchimp or campaign monitor
go look at your e-mails, find a promo and you'll see something similar. [i'm looking at one from time warner right now.](

Lot of hostility in this comment, did a writer hurt you?

and they'll tell you okay have fun at the hotel across the street
it's an insurance in case you light the mattress on fire, not a tab for the mini bar
@_date: 2014-06-22 20:32:30
That's still not spending bitcoin at a retailer

what kind of magical car do you have where it's not 140 degrees after sitting in the sun when you get into it?

The reason won't be 'discussing bitcoin', it will be 'discussing drug activity'
edit: look at his profile, this is a troll post. certainly some illuminating comments in here though, i like the guy who proposed suing for infringing on his right to free speech.
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:55:58
That's not paying in bitcoin, that's paying with a gift card
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:43:30


I'm sorry, that pretty much just tells me that you aren't on top of your business if you don't know what the costs of doing it are.

Trump shares the views of the last person he spoke to

And they have a way for you to do that- reddit gold.


this is not an issue currently, why would it become one in the future?
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:04:49
can you explain why people would start paying microtransactions to access a significant amount of websites?
if cnn starts charging me .005 cents to view their site im just going to go to msnbc instead and so on and so forth
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:03:46
Can you give me an example? All I can come up with is small, niche blogs and I'd find a free alternative on say tumblr before I started paying to access them.
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:05:00
in what way
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:01:27


I have that already- it's called adblock and its free
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:16:41


If you are getting paid per visitor the exact opposite of this will (and does) happen
this is taking click bait to new heights, instead of hoping visitors to your 7 wild ways to beat the heat this summer (you wont believe number 5!) blog click on an ad to earn you money, you get it directly

they have 20k users (gamers, presumably mid-high end machines)

he's mainstream in libertarian echo chambers, sure. and yeah, i'm one of 'those' bitcoiners interested in making money, but i'm starting to feel like an idiot upon seeing how many of you people are paultards.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:52:16
are you implying that they got to those positions by guessing?

he doesn't think evolution is real. if he's willing to ignore mountains of evidence to fit his own worldview, i would consider much of what he has to say unimportant.

Apple sees anything they don't control as a threat to their business model. Why do you think instead of just competing, they tried to sue everybody who makes a rectangular phone?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:03:28


it's definitely the opposite for anyone who thinks he's a lunatic.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:27:52
does he really deserve it? he made a risky (AT BEST) bet and got super lucky
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:43:24
sure thing, boss.
@_date: 2013-05-01 08:22:12
They have over 20k users. Hypothetically, lets say 25% of users were mining the whole time (its also a mumble client, people will sit with it open 24/7) and all of them have average to high end PC's (it is a gaming service) is that a realistic number? I've been around Kane a long time and don't believe for a second he's telling the truth about the scope of this.
