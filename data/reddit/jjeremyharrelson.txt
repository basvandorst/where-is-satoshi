You're a good fellow.  I don't care what your friends and I say about you.

Okay, then how is the value established?  How can the soundness of the money be enforced?  No one person has to accept new rules?  Then when does a BitCoin cease to be a BitCoin?  I don't understand.

This is not completely true.  There are formulae which can verify how much gold is in any 'gold' product.  Discrete mathematics; thank you for your comments.

I don't think you understood my point.  Discreet math?  Which is what exactly?  The gold content within a French Franc as is mathematically determined, and discreet.  Please explain this nebulous math for BitCoin.  When does a BitCoin cease being a BitCoin?

Very interesting.  So a person could trace the mining source; making it a virtual commodity money.  Yes?

Can this not be hacked and... counterfeited?

Who or what determines that this trajectory will continue?

I see.  So the only possible course of action to 'create' a 'counterfeit' BitCoin would be to forgo counterfeiting and instead create a competing currency.  Yes?
