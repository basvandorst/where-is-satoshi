It all comes down to what is called entropy (i.e. true randomness, and a lot of it).
Imagine you're a band and you want to make a new CD album. Since CDs are digital, you could just generate a bunch of random ones and zeros and hopefully it sounds like music. But 99.999999999999+% of the time it never will. Yet at the same time, a CD can potentially represent every song ever written, every conversation ever spoken (broken into 74 minute segments, of course) and every single sound in the course of human existence that anyone has ever heard.
So as you can see, it's way easier to just make music and record it to ones and zeros rather than to try and generate it randomly, because music itself is a lot less random. Now just think of your standard randomly generated bitcoin wallet as randomly sticking ones and zeros on a CD, and a Brainwallet as recording a song on a CD. Going the latter route, there's a lot less randomness in those ones and zeros. If you take a sentence that already exists and make it a Brainwallet, you're pretty SOL. If you invent a sentence that has probably never been uttered before in all of humanity, it's still not as random as something that is *truly* random, because there is predictable structure to the sentence. But if you come up with something truly random, the problem becomes is that truly random thing easy to memorize? If not, then why use a Brainwallet at all?

I'm so glad one of the audience questioners called him out on mining not becoming more centralized. Bitcoin's reward scheme is a winner takes all lottery, which means the reward statistically favors those with more hashing power. Couple this with the abrupt halving of rewards which shakes out weak miners, it should be obvious that only a small handful of mining entities will ever exist as time goes on.
He also is incredibly misguided in thinking that only government monetary policy is responsible for boom and bust cycles. Booms and busts are a natural phenomenon that occur everywhere in nature. You would think a free market libertarian would be aware of that.

Even science is a field filled with flawed human beings with massive egos. I, for one, am happy when a scientist's ego is put into check. The science itself should be the matter of importance, and that science can and should be worked on and continued on by different people over several years.
So I argue maybe it is good to have some old blood leave and some new blood enter the Bitcoin development space. If we want this technology to still exist 50 years from now, that's how things inevitably are going to have to be anyway.

How can the network not handle an 8x increase in block size? Bitcoin has matured quite a lot since 2010. An 8 fold increase in block size (which would not happen overnight, btw) is not going to destroy Bitcoin.
At the time Satoshi placed the cap in October 2010, the average block size was less than 0.02MB, which meant his anti-DoS measure placed a cap at 50x the normal traffic. Now that cap is only 2x the normal traffic. NORMAL TRAFFIC. Not DoS attack traffic. How is it not clear the limit needs to be bumped up?

Only problem I can see with using your email address as a salt is there have been known leaks of email addresses associated with users of bitcoin from websites such as Coinbase.

Still orders of magnitude better than Brainwallet though. Just something to be cautious about.

Two blockchains diverged on the internet,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one miner, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  
Then took the other, as just as fair  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,  
And both that morning equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black.  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
I doubted if I should ever come back.  
I shall be telling this with a sigh  
Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
Two blockchains diverged on the internet, and I —  
I took the one less hashed by,  
And that has made all the difference

@_date: 2015-08-24 19:57:51
Please hear me out on this. I don't think BIP 100 is good for the free market for a couple reasons. The main one is that a market likes solid, predictable boundaries, and the fewer possible variables the better. BIP 101 is very easy to follow. We know exactly what the block size cap is going to be 5 years from now or 10 years from now, and we all can plan and work around this. With BIP 100, we have no clue what the block size will be. Hell, it may even be higher than it would have been with BIP 101.
The other issue is fee processing competition. Say there is a miner that only wants to produce small blocks and only includes the transactions with the highest fees. They do this because they don't have access to quality and inexpensive internet. Then there's another miner willing to make large blocks because internet connectivity is no issue to them. If the small block miners outnumber the big block miners sufficiently, then under BIP 100 the big block miners are not allowed to produce the bigger blocks that they want, and fees are forced to rise, even though a competing miner can offer all Bitcoin users lower fees. This miner's hands are tied and is not allowed to compete with the other miners.

Your recent video is excellent, but I couldn't help realize how the Bitcoin network works exactly in the manner you advocate against. "Voting" on which Bitcoin blockchain is the true blockchain is a winner takes all proposition. We cannot have one Bitcoin blockchain with a 1MB limit and another with a 8MB limit. We will have to vote whether Core or XT are the clients we want, and the minority side is shit out of luck as their blockchain becomes worthless. Hell, even Bitcoin's block reward scheme is winner takes all, which will eventually lead to centralization of mining power.

The time to be conservative is when the product/business/technology is mature and well adopted. Being too conservative this early in Bitcoin's life basically guarantees another cryptocurrency will win out and take its place.
Bitcoin's not even 8 years old and already it's being treated like a bureaucratic behemoth rather than a nimble and adaptive startup.

For real. TL;DR for anyone not wanting to waste their time: Core devs don't believe the blockchain is scalable, therefor we should not scale it. The number of devs who believe the blockchain to be unscalable outnumber the number of devs who don't.
If the blockchain can't be scaled then maybe this experiment that is Bitcoin is a failure after all.

The only arguments against that are because miners with shitty internet connections will have to set up shop somewhere else. But so what? Miners with expensive electricity have to set up shop somewhere else, too, or go out of business.
Miners with better internet connections who allow bigger blocks provide value to Bitcoin. They make it possible for there to be more transactions per second, and they keep fees low. You have to have a warped sense of logic to think those two things are *bad* for Bitcoin. Guess what, Bitcoin doesn't exist in a bubble.

Because the miners get paid sufficiently with with the block reward subsidy. There's no reason for a fee market yet, especially when the system is more than capable of handling larger blocks.
New user adoption is still vital to Bitcoin. If new users have to start paying higher and higher fees this early in Bitcoin's life, they are going to move away to better services. There is absolutely no justification for having a fee market now. It's silly and unnecessary. Raising fees later is not going to hurt bitcoin. If anything Bitcoin should be more valuable in the future and people *will be willing* to pay higher fees at that time.

When the block size cap was first implemented, the limit was at more than 50 times the average block size back then.

Also if 75% is reached months before January 2016, you will likely see the other 25% concede and switch to XT before the blockchain forks so as to not be mining on a worthless chain.

Face it. XT wins at game theory. Miners want bigger blocks. Not all of them, but most of them do (even if they don't realize it yet). They want to collect more fees as the block rewards decrease. They want the blockchain to be used by more people and businesses because that adds value to it. They don't want side chains and Lightning Network collecting the bulk of their transaction fees. The miners want that control. And by golly they are going to vote for it eventually. You will see. I know you don't think it's fair, but that's life for you.

Because all the people running full nodes on their Raspberry Pi's will need to upgrade their hardware and people in the 3rd world without access to phenomenal internet bandwidth won't be able to run full nodes either, and if your average Bitcoin user isn't running a full node then Bitcoin is a failure!
As you can see, the argument truly comes down to ideology and fundamentalism that which a small group of people think Bitcoin *ought* to be. Yet they completely fail to realize that the true value in Bitcoin is its blockchain, and to cripple the size and access to the blockchain is to cripple Bitcoin, which is ironically what would truly spell failure for Bitcoin as a better altcoin comes along that is not crippled and supersedes it.

Because now's not the time considering the subsidy miners get and how so few people actually use Bitcoin.

I find it peculiar that Satoshi would come out of the woodwork only to disappear into obscurity again and not offer continual dialogue. He supposedly did a similar thing when there was an email sent from an old account of his declaring that he isn't Dorian Nakamoto. One email then back to obscurity.
You have to ask yourself why did Satoshi disappear in the first place? To hide from government or other threats? To bow down from a position of authority and hand over a project that is greater than himself? Or is he simply dead? In either of those cases, why would he risk coming back just so he could toe the same old same old Blockstream agenda? There was nothing technical written. It was all fundamentalist ideology. It was a rabble rousing political statement rather than a solution to anything. Has Satoshi ever written anything in that kind of tone?
I ain't falling for the propaganda. That's not Satoshi. Sure, he never had to sign his messages before. But if he feels so strongly about this issue and he wants us to take him seriously then he needs to start signing his messages and offering more conversation.
This whole thing's a fucking hoax until proven otherwise.

If only a tiny elite group of people are allowed to make changes to the protocol, and easily getting around that elite group equates to failure of Bitcoin since apparently its development process is hyper fragile, then perhaps Bitcoin's failure was inevitable.

Just because a person has specialized knowledge on how to create a more fuel efficient car doesn't mean they should dictate how city roads and zones are planned. In an ideal world every road and zone would be 100% optimized to allow for maximum efficiency. But that's not how the real world works. Growth needs to be allowed to occur organically (with guidance).
My point is, if we wait to raise the block size limit until Bitcoin is perfect, we'll have missed the boat. The organic growth will likely happen elsewhere. And since the optimizations done by the devs have made larger blocks more feasible, then isn't that all the more reason to raise the limit?

Two reasons. First, miners messing with the blockchain would be easily detectable. Second, messing with the blockchain would require collusion. To do such a thing would make Bitcoin worthless and therefore at the very least it means the miners would end up killing their golden goose, and at the very worst putting the world into turmoil (in a scenario where Bitcoin is the world reserve currency). It's the same reason the U.S. and Russia never nuked each other. Turns out mutually assured destruction is incentive enough to not do it.

Who defines what is "good"? How do we distinguish good from bad? If 99% think something is bad, and 1% thinks something is good, and that 1% holds Bitcoin hostage, that is a serious flaw to this whole system and is not how things should work.
Bitcoin is and has always been a *consensus network*. What's good is what the majority agrees is good. What is considered "good" has never and will never have to be 100% agreed upon.

To generate your private and public keys in Bitcoin, both SHA256 and ECDSA algorithms are used. SHA256 hashes are very quick and easy to generate, so it's feasible to build a huge database of common words and phrases and find their SHA256 counterpart.
Apparently some people were saying Brainwallets are secure enough because you also have to perform ECDSA which is a bit slower to do, but the author is saying ECDSA is not sufficiently slow. You can still calculate hundreds of thousands or potentially even millions of dictionary attacks per second on Brainwallets. That number should ideally be closer to 1 attack per second, using much more CPU intensive algorithms to derive the key.

Why? I don't understand people's desire for this. The blockchain is *useful*, and permissionlessly being able to use it is what gives Bitcoin *value*. Having blockchain transactions be accessible to more people also brings value, as more people are able to hold actual bitcoin and use it as money.
Why should people have to rely on offchain services, especially this early in Bitcoin's life? It slows down progress and creates a fee market when there doesn't need to be one yet. You don't create a fee market until the technology is widely adopted and accepted. This is business growth 101.

It would be better for Bitcoin if those miners put in some effort to getting a better internet connection. They shouldn't drag the whole network down with them.

It's still an exciting new form of electronic money and immutable consensus. Just because there will be much fewer miners and nodes than there are now does not mean the technology will be worthless. Bitcoin can still work and exist even if there are to be only 3 mining entities in say, 50 years.

Bitcoin derives its value from the blockchain. If you cripple how much can be put on the blockchain and the number of people who can use it, you ultimately hurt the value of it.
I demand one universal publicly accessible ledger. *That* is why I care about Bitcoin. That is why we must allow for bigger blocks.
The Doomsayers worrying about 8MB blocks absolutely cannot see the big picture. They fret over centralization yet fail to realize centralization has been occurring and will continue to occur regardless. So just give me my bigger blocks already so we can move on.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:26:12
I think Brainwallets are useful in cases where someone wants to use their own source of entropy not generated by a computer, but instead by dice or playing cards.
There's no way you could ever crack a Brainwallet that uses a deck of 52 well-shuffled playing cards + salting it with your email address or something. Just bruteforcing the cards themselves (no salt) would take 245759936320788380647489513852337188357679246840220123200 tries per second for the next 100 years, and even then there's only a 50% chance of it being found. Yes, I did the math.
So it's wrong for you to say "no brain wallet will ever be secure ever in any capacity", because no one possesses a machine capable of that. And throw in a salt, use WarpWallet instead, then all bets are off. Way easier just to use the $5 wrench method or spend that money on Powerball tickets.

First of all, 20GB blocks? Get your facts straight. Second of all, who gives a shit if you can't run a full node on your laptop anymore. Guess what, you can't mine bitcoins on your laptop anymore either. Time to move on to the future instead of trying to live in the past.
Bigger blocks allows for more adoption, more adoption allows for more value. People and companies who can afford to run full nodes will. There actually is some incentive to run a full node, especially if you're a big investor in Bitcoin.

It won't survive for long.
A man could set himself on fire and he'd receive 3rd degree burns all over his body and inside his lungs. When the fire is put out, he's still fully conscious and walking. Did he survive the fire? You have to give it more than a couple days to know the answer.
The chances of a worthless chain with 25% of the hashing power surviving are effectively zero.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:26:14


This argument is hilariously baffling to me. Let me give you some perspective.
We have no qualms about miners being forced out of the market due to difficulty increases and reward halvings. These are basic aspects of the Bitcoin protocol and they also lead to centralization. So why is it that people completely ignore that aspect, yet draw the line at miners requiring more bandwidth as unacceptable and leading to centralization?
So many people around here don't see the big picture.

I never thought of it this way before, but...
Small block proponents say Bitcoin will die if the limit is raised.  
Large block proponents say Bitcoin will die if the limit is not raised soon.  
**If neither side is correct**, then raise the block limit to end this madness.
Of course, each side believes to be the correct one. But if you actually stand back and think about it and use just a little common sense, one side of the argument looks to be more right than the other.
@_date: 2015-08-08 05:45:55
It's also tiresome to see someone rant and criticize a presentation they didn't even see. Have a look at his slides he just released. He mentions Electrum. And WarpWallet is only obscure because it's relatively new to the scene, but it is for all intents and purposes BrainWallet's successor.
See the thing is, some people would rather use their own custom phrase to memorize rather than have to use Diceware-esque systems that aren't as easy to memorize. With key stretching and salting (as well other techniques proposed in the presentation to slow down brute forcing) these custom phrase wallets can be more securely used.
Of course any time there is a lack of sufficient entropy, even the most difficult to brute force system can potentially be compromised. So perhaps there is a false sense of security with something like WarpWallet.

It makes me so happy when I see someone else here who gets it. Market forces will lead to Bitcoin becoming more centralized by design. It's an inevitability. Raising the block size will have little effect on centralization, and to fight it is about as fruitless as trying to make a river flow in the other direction.
Increases in difficulty, abrupt reward halvings, the winner-takes-all block reward mechanism, no monetary incentive to run a full node... this is what has lead to the trend toward centralization. Margins get tighter, weaker players die off, the block reward lottery statistically favors those with higher hash rate.
If you could make the ideal Bitcoin mining company, it would be the one that fabricates its own ASICs and runs them off the world's cheapest electricity. Now where on earth could such a mining company set up shop? What country has access to cheap manufacturing of electronics and cheap electricity? Is it a coincidence that China owns the most Bitcoin hashing power? I think not.

Difficulty adjustments are targeted to occur once every 2 weeks. But if suddenly only 25% percent of the hash rate is mining one chain and blocks take 4x longer, it could take 8 weeks for the difficulty to lower. By that time the chain will most certainly be abandoned.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:28:07
It won't be complete centralization. Just more centralized than it is now. And I don't consider that a failure. Perhaps when bitcoin matures there will only be 3 mining entities: one in the U.S., one in China, and one in Europe. All of whom equally distrust but cooperate with one another in a sort of cold war "mutually assured destruction" manner. But that's the reality for you of a one world currency that no single government controls.
