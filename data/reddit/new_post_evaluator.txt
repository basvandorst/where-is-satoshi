Why didn't you just link a picture to the actual debt clock then? OP's not wrong.

Only humans that you have reason to think own bitcoin, and that you have a channel for holding hostage. In-person is a pretty straightforward way to intimidate someone into giving up bitcoin.

Great way to get robbed and ripped off. Never broadcast that you own crypto!

Because someone will follow that car home where there are no CCTV cameras or security guards watching, hold the car owner at gunpoint, tell him or her to get out their crypto wallet, and send the thief the balance in a semi-anonymous transaction. People don't have tons of cash accessible from home, but in most cases all their crypto is readily accessible.

Profit? Lol IDK about that...

Time to sleigh those bits
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:51:16
They'll know better than to broadcast that
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:46:12
Because you can't send a semi anonymous transaction from your cell phone outside of crypto
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:02:59
This is why it's a dumb idea to broadcast having bitcoins on license plates.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:49:48
Great...don't do it!

Don't forget the mystique of Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:37:03
I'm not saying don't tell people you trust. But whose stopping someone from blocking this lambo off, waiting for the owner, and holding him or her at gunpoint to transfer crypto. Or follow him or her home? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:51:58
A thief might not risk it all for that lmao

That's what my parents said when I was a kid. Took me an embarrassingly long time to become self sufficient.

The issue is that the name is already used in an open source, public domain way. Plus, Bitcoin Core doesn't own the technology that the term "Bitcoin" refers to.

I think Toast for XRP uses the same structure of Breadwallet.

So you just kept access to the money you gifted?

We've had a couple of these already. They're still met with mega skepticism, although the presenters that explained blockchain knew their shit. Lawyers gonna lawyer.

Is anyone keeping BCC? It sounds like the main driver of demand would be to trade it away.

Notaries aren't for safekeeping. Give it to a lawyer or banker, where there is a legal fiduciary relationship.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:51:15

The range of reactions in this thread goes to show that no one knows what the hell is going to happen. Where's that Christian Bale big short guy at?

Regardless of whether Coinbase is doing something wrong or not, you're still being affected negatively by this.. Even if it's just a mistake or oversight in their system, COINBASE IS STILL CAUSING YOU HARM. Negligence doesn't require malicious intent. The fact is that someone made a mistake, and the longer you wait on this, the less options you will have. 
By the way, I'm a transactional lawyer, and in my work I typically look to steer away from litigation unless it's truly the best option. I want to emphasize what a lot of others have said here — it would be highly prudent to *at least* consult with a lawyer now.
