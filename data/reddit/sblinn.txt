I'd like to sell a bunch of books with this -- and if possible, ebooks and audiobooks. Is integration of digital download sales something that's on the road map, or would that be (in essence) "on me" to build out my own fulfillment system and integrate it with OB?

Cool. While I'm pestering you on reddit, there's an important link in the wiki that doesn't work:
The link to the getting started guide at "To jump in, read our getting started guide." just goes back to the wiki, as:
Doesn't exist. Looks like the actual link should be:

Yup and yup.

I'm a programmer, and while yes there are quite a few libertarian programmers I'm not one. I'm not a "centrist Democrat", either, and there are quite a few programmers who are of various political backgrounds ranging from green anarchism (ding ding!) to Christian neo-fascism to capitalist-libertarians to "centrist Democrats" to old school conservatives to whatever.

I would like to use this for podcasts but 10 MB is well under what I'd need. Wonder if they'd consider paid accounts for higher limits?

This article... wow. I have the SPJ (Society of Professional Journalists) Code of Ethics tacked onto my cube wall and while this article meets 3 of the 4 sections well (seek truth and report it, act independently, be accountable) the section on "minimize harm"? Yeah, that section? It's a little more blurry when held up to this article.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:21:16
Wow. That's awfully ageist. (Also, I'm over 30.)
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:29:38
so about $300,000 USD.

Yeah I'm considering buying some kendo gear with bitcoin. I get the feeling that in a couple years it will have been some expensive gear. 
Related: once I bought a game on Steam with $20 of Bitcoin. It is now the most expensive game I have ever purchased, and I'm into Star Citizen...
(Of course, if I could have bought BTC instead of all of the stupid junk I've bought over the past decade... It is best not to think about it.)
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:41:08
Wow, USD is super inexpensive, only 0.00025 bitcoin. Time to invest?

Or a stablecoin if he was concerned about volatility. But even then there are fees at both ends. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:36:36
Yes there is the Dai Stablecoin (on Ethereum).
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:28:11
All of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:19:22
I cannot speak to the first question but to the second question absolutely yes.

My on-roads were Coinbase and LocalBitCoins.

Wish I had been awake when it hit $5500 overnight. I need to finally set up purchasing alarms and bids. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:47:08
Yes. I just have not done it yet. 
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:47:25
I’m guessing it’s the world population one?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:19
Yes, and damn it, I half-way fell for it this morning, lazily just googling "GDAX" and clicking the first link, logging in, then... oh wait, what's this? It wants my GMail password? Oh damn it. Not gdaxibtc *again*. FML.
Thankfully I have proper authentication (2-factor) set up on my Coinbase, and of course I changed my password immediately. But damn it, Google.

That’s what I came here to say. 10k bet on bitcoin v. 10 million — that’s retire now kind of money — bet on bitcoin. I’m taking the treasury note.
Now if it were 30 years instead of 10, I might take the gold.

Ping! Currently getting a "Network Error" there:




@_date: 2017-05-12 03:22:00
Yup and the $20 game I bought a month ago now has cost $40.

I'm also working on integrating coinbase into my publishing business, selling [magazines]( books, ebooks, etc. Slow going until I migrate off of Wordpress.com hosting and onto my own servers, but it's going.
