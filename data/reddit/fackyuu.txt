This is great info! thanks a lot. I'm pretty techy so I hope I can learn this stuff myself, any recommendations for learning resources? 
When you say backup seed do you mean the 24 words that trezor gives you to restore everything?
Can I ask you with all this malware and hacking is it correct to think that this is a program and not an actual person looking thru my files? For instance, if you take the 24 words and write them into a story or journal entry and then give yourself a code key to solve the puzzle, would this be safe from any hacking threat outside of a person deliberately going after your trezor's 24 characters?  Which I think would only be in a situation where you are targeted directly by someone who knows you.

Are prices on coinbase more expensive than in Skype groups + 3%? What's the limit on an exchange like coinbase?

I't just that I have confidence that bitcoin will continue to rise, there seems to be so much invested in this and I think it could be like the big banks, where they get too big to fail (unless perhaps some insane internal scam). So not matter the problems, they will be figured out, and if Bitcoin were to fail I think it'd put a stigma on all cryptocurrency in the future for the vast majority of people, slowing down long term adoption of digital currency. This is why I don't believe its the same as putting 20k on black inside a casino. 
Since I'm seriously considering this long term, I may decide to try and get roughly half in before segwit and if the price drops substantially due to problems with segwit, perhaps I think invest the other half at a much lower price. Believing it will bounce back.

Hey thanks I'll definitely get one of these solutions. How long does it take to get the bitcoin off of it if I wanted to trade it on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:39:03
Yes, I am thinking very long, maybe I didn't make that very clear. Like 10 years? Or more? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:40:00
Yes the 20k is not needed, just sitting around. I could survive without it for a decade!

Great thanks again. So the best way to use a trezor is to keep the backup seed on paper at home and use a strong passwordin a password manager. So if anyone finds or steals my seed they can't do anything without the password. How is my password safe inside a password manager?
Honestly I've never looked into password managers that much, just never trusted the idea, I have a password protected .dmg partition on my MBP and a word document inside where I store my passwords. Do you think this is unsafe?

Yes, this isn't my life savings or anything. More like money I don't really need, money that I'd want to be put in a good investment. Not a 'guarenteed' investment but more like an investment which could pay off huge in the future (like trying to start a business with the 20k  and having the business be very successful 10 years later, this is what I want, but doing it with Bitcoin seems like a lot less work than starting a new business, I'm already doing that with other...)

Yeah I was thinking it'd probably be rising soon once Segwit is running and solid. When you think about it dropping do you think something like $2400 or is it a major dip below $2000? I know you're just hypothesizing. 
Since this would be done for long term payback, not just hoping it'd double in value over the next year and then cashout or something, I might be overthinking it to try and wait for a dip right now.

Hey thanks! Do you mean August 1st? What decision uncertanties are you talking about, the Segwit approval?
Are you saying it might go down in early August, so perhaps think about waiting until that dip in price and buying big then?
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:19:54
What's the pending hard fork? I read that segwit is a soft fork right? I don't see how anyone could support a hard fork, making a legacy type version of BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:28:39
Was this the dip you were talking about waiting until August 1st for? or a difference typeof market correction? and still wait out for Aug 1?
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:44:41
Hey this is a really good suggestion. Thank you, I will consider this! Although I must say I'm worried we might see a really big increase after the Segwit thing is finished?
