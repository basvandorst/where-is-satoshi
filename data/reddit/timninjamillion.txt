Nice hashtag. How does that work?
@_date: 2019-07-27 05:31:32
Yeah, could make an exchange. Dex if you pay.
Edit: among others. MemeNTO backItlup

I use it like a bank account. I have money I have access to. Price fluctuations are ok, I trade in and out of cash when I choose to. Sometimes good, sometimes better. Sometimes bad. ... what the duck do I know? I code in java. Yet my shit works. Not much stack overflow, some I guess. Mostly other sources but that’s the key, sources.
Edit: code is code. Pure beyond belief.

They’ve been good for me.

I watch it through the internet, but you know, there’s that judeo — Christian lens.
Edit: need Christ alone.
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:50:51
I know. It doesn’t quite work that way, yet..,
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:44:19
I think you’d probably be able to do it through a bitcoin wallet using rpc and then a php/java app with a timer. If funds &gt;= 1/9 send payment: sleep 30 days.

It’ll be a while for brainscabs . Ya and brainsscana.ca but go figure.

Where I live (Canada), if you default on your property taxes, then after three years they can get title and auction it off. I’m two years behind right now but should be almost caught up by the time they’re due again. Sure, property taxes are like rent but I built myself so even though I’m on disability I can afford to pay that, live ok with a few luxuries and afford a little btc in the hope it goes up. I mostly just use the btc as a small savings account that I hate to touch in case it goes up.

Selective. What’s most popular will be kept, not everything available.
Edit: money has the first play, then probably media.
Edit 2: maybe guys like pewds.
@_date: 2019-10-01 23:20:05
 It won’t hurt. nope, but I’ll take it.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:17:14
You never know TIL you try?
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:45:48
It could work well with wills.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:29:45
Are the visible numbers and letters correct?
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:54:18
Probably be better to send a few sats.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:28:07
No, just crazy
Edit: that’s just because right now has all the glory, when they get ai working, watch out.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:29:33
I would like to know. Thanks.

The kind described in the bible...that God is a loving, just God, that Christ died to pay the penalty for my sins and that I’m saved by that faith, not by any of my good deeds. That god is transforming me to be more like Christ every day.

Can’t forge bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:48:59
Any links to relevant documentation?
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:48:00
I know a couple guys.
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:36:27
What recognition.  What would be the point. They’re gonna slam you at every opportunity, as you just proved.
Edit: grammar over punctuation.
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:40:49
Nope. You’d be able to dox/fix me.
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:27:59
Whether you’re paid in btc or usd for all intents and purposes they’re basically the same. It trades back and forth easily enough.
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:37:14
So producers of software shouldn’t be paid. And why wouldn’t you use it if it’s a benefit to you? Out of spite?
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:33:31
Could figure out federation, payment and code storage via blockchain. Or maybe you’d prefer to say no, that’s not possible”
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:56:50
Wouldn’t be much use if you couldn’t add to it.
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:24:30
So you’d say I’m wrong. Developers shouldn’t be paid? Really, is that what you’re saying?
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:58:31
If you can think it, it can, and probably will, be coded.
@_date: 2019-09-16 04:11:08
10329.41 by my ticker
Edit: that translates to 1 usd != 1usd

Is it a project that benefits everyone, or just your employer? Maybe I can help. Pay me.,..
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:49:47
It should be self supporting. Into perpetuity. Can your employer do that? Software can.
Edit hear of Napster, BitTorrent, bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:10:05
Think: “instance of Creation”
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:28:33
What he said.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:52:01
Ok, I might read the comments later, because everyone wants to be heard.
That aside, everybody’s got an idea not use, so consensus.
Put the developers in 1st seat. Let consensus grow from there. Best ideas win. Edit: it should be paid work.
