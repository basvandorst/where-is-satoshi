Capital One 360 is awesome, no problems. You can open up to 20 separate accounts and like 5 checking accounts. You get a debit card, you can do banking at regular capital one banks. No problems with coinbase or gdax.

I live in NY and I'm experiencing the samething. I signed up to buy BAT and see no way to purchase. Im highly upset as well. Did ur funds clear? I was thinking maybe a portal will open up once the account is funded.

IMO its a good thing that the correction is happening now at btc most highly publicize stage. Reason being that people coming now is experiencing the volatility of crypto first hand.   So  now they understand how the industry works and see bitcoin bounce back and rise even higher.  Instead of coming in and bitcoin goes up to 20k-30k. Now if bitcoin decide to correct from those prices these people will panic and sell off and bash crypto. So at the moment they get to see crypto when it's not doing well and dipping, and get to witness how crypto bounces back. Now they can be like they this is what happens I've experienced this before I'm going to hodl and not panic sell. Been there done that.

Are you on coinbase or bitstamp?

Just wait a couple days. Just check the usd transfer history on Gdax to see any progress.

Ur not able to make an instant purchase like on coinbase. Unfortunately the only way is to transfer from bank account and wait. If you want to react immediately to the market price use coinbase and like you said that's why you pay the fee (for convenience) Gdax allows you to set the price you want to pay and without a fee. Plus when you make tranfers from gdax they cover the fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:54:32
Isn't the purpose of crypto to avoid regulars, now ur crying for regulations. Did you loose money? Were you mislead in anyway? People been crying for coinbase to release bcash for months. Now that they do its a problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:23:25
So by suing ur pretty much asking to be regulated by the government. Isn't the purpose of crypto to avoid registration. This what happens when its not set rules people are going to take advantage especially when its big money on the table. Buy stock if you want to avoid manipulation.

Yeah pretty much. My goal is to eventually accumulate 1 btc.  So every paycheck I buy some. I save a portion and use the rest to buy the altcoins I'm invested in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:29:04
I buy high a buy low I just buy, because I believe that in the future all the problems btc is having will clear up. Im sure when the coin was created they didn't expect this amount of traffic and volume. The devs are working and things will get better.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:49
Did you have bitcoin before the fork? If not then  no

Does it really matter if he's getting paid, companies spend millions for athletes, actors etc to promote and pump their products. If a coin is willing to pay the 25btc its up to them to make sure that their technology will back up the pump. If not then their ship to the moon will crash and burn.

No need to worry its normal, it's about 170k unconfirmed transactions waiting. I've been waiting since 3am.

@_date: 2017-12-16 12:25:05
Its never to late to get on the train people have been jumping on moving trains for centuries. Just keep buying and hodling as much as you can. Most won't  ever get to have one full bitcoin, but having some is better than none. Yeah you might not be a millionaire but you will have some money. If you have a 1/4th of a bitcoin and let's say it hits a million, well you got your 250k. Thats more than a lot of people's salaries for a 3-4 years.

Its only $1.49 to purchase $20 worth of btc on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:22:53
Since ur new start with coinbase its very simple for newcomers. Then when you get ur feet wet sign up with there exchange gdax. You can make purchases without paying fees. On YouTube look up how to avoid paying coinbase fees. The video will walk you through. Also the most important make sure you use the official coinbase site. Its a lot of phissing sites in the crypto world, so be very careful.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:12:11
Me personally I wouldn't I got mines from ledger sometimes its better to pay more for peace of mind. They do have a list of authorized dealers on the site.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:56:55
Its gonna take some time then network is backed up. I sent some btc around 3am and I'm still waiting. Its pretty normal now a days with btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:39:59
You can purchase, ripple, litecoin, bitcoin cash, and bitcoin on bitstamp
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:59
This is nowhere near the end stop panicking and learn more about the coin. The price is already moving back up. Things like this just makes btc stronger. When people stop running around like chickens with no heads btc will be headed towards 20k +
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:30:37
I don't think that it will get to that point, especially since it was sent from Gdax. They pool most transactions and they don't low ball miner fees so it will be picked up. Now if you sent from somewhere else and  had set a low transaction fee then that probably would happen or take a couple of days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:30:54
Regardless if its the same people are not its just how the crypto world is set up. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:04:38

Smh you would think bitcoin dropped down to $10 or something
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:03:53
Sign up with there exchange Gdax and you can do the transfer without a fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:32:22
Check the blockchain and see what's happening with the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:32:11
Coinmarketcap shows the price on different exchanges but I don't think they have it in graph form.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:01:27
Coinbase is based out of  San Francisco. Why is ur bank giving you a hard time? You can also sign up for Bitstamp there based out of Vegas. They take CC.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:40:57
Did you try Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:54:47
Thats the only reason I signed up, to purchase with fiat and not have to deal with the exchange to get BAT. Once my funds clearly I'm going transfer it back and close the account. I was reading that closing the account out might be a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:56:55
You should of did a little more research instead of posting this article. Ur just as irresponsible as the person that wrote it, what he said was taken out of context. He has an explanation for calling it a bubble. Post like this so nothing to help cryptocurrency.

I've  been on reddit longer than you bozo this is a new account I forgot my password. I make enough that I don't have to take out a loan to invest in bitcoin. In this current dip/crash (I don't even want to say loss) but I've lost more than ur 10k investment. You won't see me crying or belly aching in post or asking anyone to send me coins. I know the market will bounce back and I'm not afraid like you.  If anyone's the dumb ass its you, I saw couple of ur comment history. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:21:11
I signed up to purchase BAT and its not even accessible, the app makes no sense. Now I need to figure out how to close it out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:22
What's wrong with people? I've been in crypto since August. Since then I've seen people complain about coinbase not releasing bch. Now that they release it there the devil, its a bad exchange. Yes coinbase has its problems, yeah some purchase fees are high. If ur a non noob you can use Gdax to make purchases and transfers with no fees. Coinbase has help bitcoin, its a simple Ui to get beginners started in btc and get there feet wet. As one gets more knowledgeable they can move on to other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:49

A lot of things sounds good until its actually been put to real world test. It all sounds good until it has to actually handle all those transactions. Any who IMO its space for both coins to coexist peacefully without having to compete. Btc is way ahead of the game and has been battle tested and is going nowhere. Bch could be used for day to day basic transactions. When it comes to big money transactions use btc because its value allows you to use less coins. Its like spending a $100 bill or 100  singles, 5 20's etc etc
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:37:49

At the end of the day its all about money. He's a dick but he's no idiot. Of course he's going to bash bitcoin to make his coins seem better and raise the price for BCH. He knows that the value of bitcoin is just gonna get higher and higher. So its a win win for him. His coin accumaltes value he makes money, the bitcoin he has is making him even more money. So at the end of the day its all about the money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:31:46
How would you know? Btc has almost twice the volume as bch. So until bch get anywhere near that, no one will know what bch can handle. You guys don't even know if bch can handle a fork attack.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:58
Just be patient its a lot of transactions going on.

On gdax if ur in btc/USD click deposit then in drop down window click coinbase then manually enter coin amount. The rest is self explanitory. On YouTube search, How to avoid paying coinbase fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:46:20
Just need some clarification here I got into crypto and coinbase after the fork so I won't get any BCH. So my question is to the people that got awarded bch on coinbase. Do you have access to them (bch)? If so why don't you just transfer them from coinbase to gdax or any other exchange to trade? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:16:52
Different market different currency, remember GBP is worth more than usd. The prices probably work out to be the same eventhough GBP is going down.

People need to understand the technology behind bitcoin and the innovations that happening behind the scenes. Im not going to front I'm in it for the money and profits, but I took the time to watch videos and learn what's happening. The I've learned the less worried I am about, most of these complaints and FUD people are spreading. The saying stands true "Learn what ur investing in before you invest"

Yeah look it up the info is on the site, they will explain it way better than someone bin here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:32
What the fuck are you talking about? Seems like you don't comprehend well. I said nothing about buying at 19k. I said when the price was 19k people wanted it to drop so they could purchase more (because they didn't want to pay at that price). Actually plenty of people did buy at that price. When the price was 5k and shot up to 7k then 11k people wanted it to drop so they could buy more. Some people are going to be happy their investment is soaring but some are always gonna wish it was lower so they can get a little more. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:47:23

I feel you. The way things are today hell going to work is a speculation. You can get fired a week, month, or year from now. Nothing in life is guaranteed but death and taxes. During the gold rush everyone was spectators, those who weren't afraid to step out on a limb and take chances became rich (well not all but most). Stocks are speculation its just been around longer and is less volatile. Spend what you can afford to loose, take a chance, that way you won't regret anything if the prices do sky rocket.
