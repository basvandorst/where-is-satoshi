Contact your local PD as well, the government wants BTC to be property, then it should be treated as such.  You've problem lost enough for it to be considered grand larceny.

Very nice! May I borrow it for a few months?! I need a car until I get my tax money :(

Bitcoin is property, not currency in the US. So claim it as such.  It's not an ATM, it's a goods vendor.  Like a vending machine that sells non-food items.

Well, since you're trying to get rid of them all, would you like to.... Make my day?

I used to intern at geni.org they're basically based behind the motto. I wish I could have understand what I was doing then and fully appreciated it. I would love to go back and intern there again.

The bank isn't a free country. It's a private institution. She is not being forced to use the bank to hold her funds.

Exactly.  They can refund the money and keep the coins because the market fluctuated.  It shouldn't be that way.  There needs to be regulation and oversight.
@_date: 2016-12-24 22:16:39
No they don't, it's unregulated. They can do whatever they very well please.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:10:58
Well. Crap.

I need a better job. Any market for EMT's?
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:02:59
What about texting or sending an automated call to the users?

Nope... Sadly, he cashed out a while ago and used it to pay off his house and car. While not millionaire, he's able to live debt-free other than utility bills which I would have still killed to be able to do.  
It's crazy, even working in a 911 system, I only make 11 bucks an hour as an EMT.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:34:19
Which....is nice?  Isn't that about 11k?!

Slow down the final path and bump up the RPM some as it will give you a better finish. I would then get it sent out to be powder coated entirely to ensure the inner paint won't chip off ever.  Then you can take a large insert endmill (can't remember what the actual name is, but they're about 2" wide and have inserts for the blades), and surface the top to pull off only the top layer of powder coating exposing the metal.
It looks cool! What software did you use to do all of this? I used to do some CNC milling in high school with solidworks and mastercam.

You sir, are awesome if you're the one that gave it to him.  I'm glad someone else can benefit from this.  3 years ago, my uncle told me to take the ~1000 bucks my grandma left me and put it into btc. I didn't, and instead bought a new top for my POS 1992 mercury capri convertible... I'd be a multi-millionare right now if I would have done it.  Now I'm stuck at ~6k in debt and living paycheck to paycheck.  Thank you for making his day!
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:52:55
He just imported his wallet probably.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:32:45
True. Wish my debt to income ratio was better though!
