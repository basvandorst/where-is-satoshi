Yes, if you want to day trade you will need to keep some coin on your exchange of choice that you would like to trade on. 
The reason you did not incur any fees when going from GDAX to your Nano is because GDAX covered the fees for you. The speed at which the transaction occurs is related to how high of a fee you would like to pay. If you (or GDAX in this instance) choose a higher fee, the transaction will be fast. The same is true for going from your nano to GDAX (although you will cover this fee yourself). You can choose the fee amount in the Nano wallet on your computer (there is a setting somewhere, look for it). 
Transactions from your hardware wallet (Nano) to GDAX are different from the ones that happen when you trade on the exchange. Trading on the exchange is all done in GDAX world, where they may or may not have to actually move coins. They can just take note of the trades and credit individual accounts without the transactions taking place on the blockchain, meaning when you trade on an exchange its not a real transaction. The transaction takes place when you move from one wallet to another, i.e. taking your coins off the exchange.
Hope this helps!

It's the same as BTC, moving from coinbase to GDAX is done internally through coinbase, as they are the same company. 
The fees are cheaper for both of those coins so its cheaper/faster to get them to the nano and from the nano back to GDAX if you're interested in storing/trading them. Although it's going to be pretty close to the same for all three coins, except BTC may be a tad more expensive depending on which fee setting you choose. I tend to move most of my stuff around with LTC.

If you're talking about the transcation from GDAX to your Nano, it's not instantaneously. It's about 15 minutes probably, if it was any faster, you probably got lucky or didn't notice how much time had passed. I think I had one go through in like 5 minutes before when traffic was low and GDAX was paying the fees.
You're correct in thinking it is no different than any other transaction that wouldn't be coming from GDAX.
If you're talking about Coinbase to GDAX, that IS instant, as they are just moving around coins between accounts on their end. It (most likely) has nothing to do with the blockchain.

If you're worried about it crashing, which is the only thing I can think of you being worried about for the sake of this question, just put your coin on an exchange and set a stop loss order. Then if the price drops too low it will trigger a sell and maybe you can get out before it crashes completely.
Other than that I don't see what else there is to do besides not seeing the change in your equity on a day to day basis...

You should give everyone your password. They only put those things on accounts to annoy and hassle you, after all.

Nice! It would only be fair to get a 25% broker fee! :)

No, you have to have a gain on the investment to get taxed. In fact, you can even include this as a deduction against future gains in the same tax year.

I never had a pillow of savings growing up. I did ok! Worst case scenario he has to settle for a beater instead of a lambo when he’s older.
