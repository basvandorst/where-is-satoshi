woah, you just tipped someone on reddit..my mind is blown (I'm not being sarcastic, this is the first time I've seen/heard about this bot)!

It would be possible, yet pretty hard to set up.  You can't really lend large sums to anonymous people without taking large losses.  If you get rid of the anonymous aspect and require legal names and a legal contract, you open yourself to regulation by the government if you ever want to enforce that contract using the legal system.  You'd basically have to be incorporated as a bank that happens to lend in bitcoin.

From what I can tell, it is a very thin device that sits on top of your sim card.  It intercepts sim 'messages' travelling between your sim card and phone without either being able to tell it's there.  It stores your private key in its hardware and allows you to send encrypted sms messages containing a bitcoin transaction.  It also includes it's own NFC chip to allow contactless transactions without relying on your phone's NFC chip (for phones without NFC and for phones that have 'secure' NFC).  It basically bypasses phone carriers and phone manufacturers completely to send secure transactions via regular sms or via NFC.

Why did you post the same thing under 3 different accounts? wtf?

Or the opposite.  Deposite into CaVirtex and then transfer to Mt. Gox, then do the reverse and cash out.

Just playing devil's advocate here, but is it really a free market when 99% of trades are ties to Mt. Gox?  How does one know they are not manipulating the prices for their own gain?  Someone has the assurance of the SEC/regulators (that may mean more to some than other, of course) and the legal system to prevent, say, the NASDAQ from being manipulated from the inside.  Just a thought.

I think a system like  uses might work.  They encrypt a string of text with your PGP public key, which you have to decrypt then supply the string in order to gain authentication.  It wouldn't prevent key loggers I suppose...

I've thought of trying to build something like this, but I can't get past the point that in order for your work to be computed on other people's computers, it has to be unencrypted.  That's cool for science and folding type projects, but who in their right mind will be doing anything of value on one of these grids if everything is potentially compromised?

Nope.  Go into the Mt. Gox deposit page and there will be an option to send BTC.  You have to enter the amount you are going to send, and it will give you a BitCoin address to send it to.  Then go into CaVirtex's withdraw page and send the BTC to the address Mt. Gox gave you.  To do the reverse, find your CaVirtex BitCoin address and send your BTC from Mt. Gox to it.  CaVirtex has a permanent address, while Mt. Gox generates one for you each time (and is only valid for 24 hours).  It took about 1.5 hours to go from CaVirtex into Mt. Gox but I've heard of people having theirs show up in 20-30 minutes.  If you do it right you can exploit the difference between CaVirtex and Mt. Gox.  CaVirtex at odd hours has virtually no traffic and people leave up orders over night, so if Mt. Gox is moving, there's some profit to be had shuffling BTC around.

How would a POS system work?  I mean it would be easy to implement but somewhat useless with transactions taking 20-60 minutes to clear.  That's going to be a major hurdle for BTC.  Works okay for online shopping and whatnot, but retail or stuff you want "instantly" online is going to be tough.   
*edit*   
It would be cool none the less.  Pretty simple really, too.  Small LCD screen that displays a QR code with the amount owed and the BT address.  Person scans code with their BitCoin smartphone app and confirms amount and hits send.  Then waits 30 minutes for it to clear :P.

In theory it was because Mt. Gox had a $1000 limit on transferring money or equivalent in coins.  So if the hackers crashed the price, they would be able to transfer a metric shit-ton of coins out of Mt. Gox because they are nearly worthless and therefor under the $1000 limit.  Once the price rebounds, sell the coins and profit.  No idea if they actually succeeded or not, but I figure that's the reason.

They don't yet have an API.

I was wondering, is there any way to transition from bitcoins to something like bitcoin v2 without losing everything/starting from scratch?  Maybe something built upon hashing the old sha256 keyspace together with something else using sha512?  I don't know what I'm really talking about, but hopefully that makes sense.

I thought transaction fees were built into the client, not the protocol?  Who's going to pay a transaction fee if they don't have to?  I'm sure people can/will take out the transaction fee code.  &lt;disclamer&gt;I could be misunderstanding the entire concept..

Stability is excellent.  We just need people actually taking BTC for goods and services (I mean at a volume that can support $20/btc)
@_date: 2011-06-15 08:35:34
There's some folks on  (irc.freenode.net) lending coins (for a fee, of course).  You can short sell that way.

Can someone eli5 the lightning network/thunder for me?  Let's use Reddit for example.  Let's say they want to introduce micropayments for upvotes.  Simple way would be that I'd load some btc into a Reddit wallet and every time I upvote, a TX is sent out.  The problem would be TX fees and scalability, having to do one TX per upvote.  So Reddit decides to use Thunder.  I click upvote... Where does the money go and how/when does it reach the recipient?

Short of something extreme happening (such as a country adopting BTC en mass or maybe Iran starting to sell oil in BTC) the price will come down.  It's a speculator driven bubble at the moment.  There's not much of a real demand for BTC besides people trying to make a buck.  When/if BTC is used for billions of dollars worth of transactions (not just currency exchanges) a year then the price may be sustainable.

I think it would be hard to outright stop it, but I think they could put a pretty good dent in it's use and growth.  All it would take is making it hard to use by requiring all ISPs to block the bitcoin protocol.  Sure, you could always use VPNs and encryption and the like to get around that, but if Bitcoin became mainstream it would have to be easy to use by the general public.  Once it starts getting complicated, it's usage (by the mainstream population) would tail off.

It's probably against the terms of service, but a system like tip bot might work.  Add tip bot as a friend, it monitors your posts, when you post +tip John Doe it sends a message to John Doe saying how to get his tip (or just sends it if John Doe is already set up with an address).
