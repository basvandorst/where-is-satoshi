Personally I wouldn’t, I have 3 types of saving methods and bitcoin is only one, seems like you have a good thing going there so I’d just use residual income for bitcoin. Maybe you could lower the 100£ to 50£ and put the other 50 into bitcoin

Who cares about the time table, why is only the last 50 years relevant. Britain has invaded 90% of the countries on the globe btw.

Just started actually reading up on blockchain and I gotta say, it’s pretty undeniable that it is going to be the future technology. I just grew even more confident about my holdings.

You know trump is just dumping the price so he can swoop in and buy a haul of it

So I kind of feel the same way. I wanted to put a large sum of money in bitcoin at once but I don’t think it’s the way to go, unless you can catch a dip (I was thinking sub 6k). But who knows when and if that’ll happen again so I’ve been strategically buying in $100 intervals, not based in a schedule but when I feel the price is good. Then I plan to put maybe a couple grand in when I think the price is even better, probably sub 8k. And to answer your wallet question, I got a ledger nano s because it’s recommended to store your bitcoin outside of a mobile wallet. Trezor is also another wallet to check out.

The mongols and Roman Empire are criticized? I’m not saying the us hasn’t made bad decisions regarding foreign policy in the last century, because they have. What I have a problem with is this idea that the US is the only country that’s every done anything bad, like come on, this has been happening for all of human history why is everyone pretending it’s just the US.
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:48:48
Yikes my bad lol
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:39:23
Yea we Nuked a country to end a war which would have had many more deaths than if we didn’t nuke it. Other countries have done equally worse if not worse things than that.
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:17:56
What the hell are you talking about? I’m not saying the US hasn’t done bad things, it’s just everyone acts like the US is the ONLY country that has done bad things, it’s ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:04:42
Type that on google sheet
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:59:11
And we were talking about WWll which the US only “intervened” in because they bombed Pearl Harbor, should we have done nothing?
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:25:33
As if America was the only country to do questionable things gtfo, Reddit is useful for information on a subject but when it comes to politics it’s just a bunch of mindless zombies who only know to hate America.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:39:47
Ah okay, well anyways I’d still keep that account and just put some money in bitcoin when you can and go about it the DCA way
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:04:59
Idk why people give ethereum shit, I don’t see anything bad about it, I actually think the technology is really cool as far as smart contracts go.

Any good bitcoin podcasts?

Oh that’s cool, does it not work for excel?
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:04:56

In that case, 4 states would determine the election
And I believe the rest of the US would like to have a say
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:44:14
Exactly so the normal supply demand curve wouldn’t work in this case

Once you sell you lose your money, just buy when it’s down and average it out

I’ve had some bitcoin since 2017, just now getting serious about buying it regularly. During a bull market, will you guys buy even when the price is up, or wait for a correction?
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:32:15
Well idk about the op but for my spreadsheet on excel I use the price of bitcoin to determine my total investment, so I update it whenever I want to know.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:53:19
There’s like a $10 difference so I was wondering if there was anything significant
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:56:04
Well as demand increases, supply decreases, raising the price in theory
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:21:16
Which interface displays the full address?
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:19:17
Right I see what you’re saying, but it’s kind of weird in this case since usually price and supply are directly related but there is a fixed supply. So what does happen?
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:09:37
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:18:04
Thank you fellow bitcoiner!
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:15:32
It’s called halving and yes by theory it should drive demand up

Ah okay thanks for the help!

Have you made a Coinbase account? I should show up under settings&gt;add payment method
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:52:57
Are you using a credit card or bank account?
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:28:11
How can you do that
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:25:28
I’m new to wallets, Trezer one or ledger nano s???
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:37:39
Anyone here use or know anything about VUVIV? I bought a trezor from them on amazon and they seem pretty legit. They say they are an official retailer of trezor.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:00:15
Oh boy
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:01:49
Lol yea who cares just ride the wave
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:42:24
Yea I did too thank god my average cost is kind of low still
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:22:42
I Honestly want bitcoin to drop to 5k so I can buy as much as I can for the huge rise to come
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:50:07
I know I shit a brick
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:08:00
Ahh okay that makes sense thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:05:16
You an either bitch about hypothetically losing money (money isn’t lost until you sell) or you can buy more and not miss out when it rises again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:32:47
You got that right
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:50:32
Oh yea I’m all in on DCA
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:47:14
I meant states not cities my apologies
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:33:34
The thing that confuses me is price is usually the dependent variable in those graphs, but with bitcoin isn’t it the supply?
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:32:54
I bought at 5k, not enough though
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:29:00
I use Coinbase, although people hate it I feel safe for now until I get a ledger. Also hear cashapp is good
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:18:07
