"redditor for 1 month" - I am guessing you've been in Bitcoin for approximately as long? My sweet summer child, please don't give people advice when you have no idea what you are talking about.

I have to say that these ads are pretty good

For a support job I'd only be interested if I could work from wherever I want. Decentralized currency but centralized office? No, thanks! English/German/Spanish/French speaker here.

Damn, good trip down memory lane, thanks.

Oh, my sweet summer child.

I am a hodler since 2010 and I am almost as excited as in November 2013. This is not just another day at the office.

Had he just kept his Bitcoin instead of trading against other cryptos, he would have more than $48k right now... just saying.

There is a (public listed) company I know where someone did just that. They caught the miners once the guy was gone but they didn't sue because they didn't want word to get out.

Your math is wrong, butvit still reminds me how I made both the best investment of my life and the worst (as in: I could be a millionaire by now)
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:21:35
At the time it felt a bit sketchy buying via paypal on mtgox and waiting 30 days to withdraw.
@_date: 2017-05-03 09:22:57
I don't think I can prove it (my buying history on mtgox is long gone, as you can imagine), but I distinctly remember learning about BTC while reading this article: 
At the publication's date, the article mentions that BTC were trading at 6 cents.

I didn't invest as much as I could have, unfortunately... Nowadays I invest in safer funds in order to diversify, but I still hodl.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:40:31


The word you are looking for might me "straw man"?
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:12:02
14 cents here. I remember when we hit $7 for the first time and I felt rich. Little did I know! Still hodling.

Sorry to be rude, but wtf is wrong with your spelling? You can't seem to be able to spell your own currency consistently, nor can you spell your neighbouring country's name. I am starting to doubt you're even from Venezuela.

Same here. Paid for 1 year of VPN with about 7 bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:57:06
I remember the time when you could buy bitcoin with paypal on MtGox (1st version)
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:54:21
down-voted because you are being a douche.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:50:33
Hasn't he commited suicide?
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:40:49
Wait. That one was the CFO [and he's out!](
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:21:10
Some of them (such as me) are also just trying to get their cash-out in local currency transfered to their account. They denied me the bank transfer a week ago because I use a VPN. I submitted my ID on Wednesday and I am still  in the verification queue.

Nice one - bitcoin on pizza.de would be a huge step forward!
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:29:54
3 years ago you could buy on mtgox and pay with paypal. I wish I had had more than €3.5 on my paypal account at the time. I read about it on a linux news website and immediately bought about 50 BTC, the biggest chunk of which I still have :-)

It would be interesting to add the BTC/USD conversion rate at the time of the quotes.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:41:26
I ate sushi and bought chocolate + other groceries: 
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:13:32
Woah, thank you! My first bitcoin tip :-)
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:37:36
You may want to avoid storing your passwords on a 3rd party service such as lastpass.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:42:46
Oh, and I also invited my girlfriend to a hot chocolate in Palo Alto (Coupa Café)

Yesterday in the subway in Germany I heard Venezuelan teenagers talking about bitcoins and how they wished they had bought earlier. That's when I realized it's definitely going mainstream.
