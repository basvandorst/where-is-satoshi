It would be a hell of a lot simpler to just use google wallet. It's free, easy, and no fees.
//edit: Lol, I'm getting downvoted for the obvious truth.

I've always known virtual currencies as those from MMORPGs, i.e. pixel crack.

Why the fuck would you want to use IE?

And Canada. That would cover at least 80% of the donors.

Try actually reading taxi ordinances. They are 99% consumer protection that protect against discrimination and excessive rate hikes. Like how Uber just nailed someone for a $300 taxi ride on Halloween.

Never happen, no charge backs or negative balances. They wouldn't be able to fuck sellers accepting bitcoin.

The taxi industry has existed in this country for the better part of a century. There's a reason why there are rate regulations and that's a fine example of it.

It's sad you're still using sourceforge.

There's not a big difference between game currency and crypto currency. Both are generated by time input. With bitcoin you are hashing and MMOs you are playing (macroing) the game. Games can print their own money, but they typically don't.
When bitcoin first came out I considered it because it was practically the same thing I was doing when I macroed Ultima Online for gold. I run this program, sell this product to someone for cash.

You spent your half. Give the rest to your sister.
Also, you suck at arbitrage.
