Paper money is technically fake money as well. Just sayin. 
I believe Bitcoin's success will be more because of its online buying abilities and world market expansion.

you are giving gold?
What does it do?

I will be visiting on my next trip up.

I was wondering when I would see something about BlackArrow brought up. I purchased a batch of their Prospero X1 back in March. Still haven't received anything, and I doubt if I ever will. They have messed up several times with their X3 model causing customers to have to ship the miners back due to failing power supplies the first time, and then after that was fixed some of the boards started to fry due to improper soldering. They are just another BL that over promises and under delivers.

I agree. We would need to see the cap for BTC reach 100 billion first :D
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:51:02
I am buying my Bitcoin now (hopefully at a good price) just for that reason.

I will continue not using them. Or any other "crypto news source"

Always nice to see what you guys are up to, and know how committed you are to bitcoin. What are your thoughts on the recent bitstamp hack and the securities that go along with running an exchange or even an etf that has to do with bitcoin?

It's the twins' account that posted this. That is why I asked my question.
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:48:13
and so the washing begins
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:15:48
Well I just did over 30 manual transactions. Hope it helps.

bitcoin should be put into the high risk section of your investment portfolio. $200 is somewhat low, but the trend is still downward (bearish).

You are just going to blow (potentially) millions of dollars on black friday?!
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:53:56
same. I will be buying once it hits too no matter the price. I am opening a long here to hold for years.

lol @ chase bank commercial 
@_date: 2015-02-18 10:51:43
still some to go?

Yes. I rarely make sports bets, but I recently made a bet on the superbowl and won. Their payout is fast they have great withdraw/deposit speed.

Isn't Gods Unchained being developed with people from MTG?

Bringing up all of the bigger names that have been talking about it lately might be a good start. There are so many positive things being said about bitcoin from many credible sources. Everyone I've talked to about bitcoin was a skeptic at first until I laid it all out there. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:45:56
This is the best strategy.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:18:17
I would say they areb both nice. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:23:27
just wait til you can pay for a new Tesla with just one of your bitcoins :)
