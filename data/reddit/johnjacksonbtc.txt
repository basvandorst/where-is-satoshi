In addition to this if you spend or receive coins after hard fork you need to monitor your wallet on BOTH chains. Ignore transactions that have different outcome at both sides unless you know what that means. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:11:49
Nope. It is measurement of bitcoin resistance.
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:56:13
Can you detail these compromises?
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:58:40
Last 144 blocks showed less support for segwit compared to 1000 blocks
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:05:05
Double sha256 over pubkey would do a trick.

Could you move these valuable altcoin discussions to appropriate subreddit?

Please elaborate why my transaction malleability fixing solution without segwit is not solution at all. It is clear statement for miners to reject blocks with malleated transactions and do not use segwit as malleability fix. 
Majority of wallets create transactions in correct format and with this restriction no malleated version of transaction is comfirmed without using segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:50:02
Malleability IS NOT permanent feature for current transaction format. It is fixable without creating new transaction dialect.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:55:34
My node would relay non segwit chain and does not give a fart about imaginary exchanges that would not do that.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:14:16
Segwit will be future to 1mb chain after 75% will go to BU. Then segwit supporters can perform unfamous twenty three seventy five fork.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:06:52
Why do you want segwit to activate with no majority miner support? Are you promoting segwit sucide?
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:23:55
By upgrading to segwit non segwit transactions remains malleable. Why everyone is refusing to fix malleability directly? Fixing problem direct cause DOES help without upgrading if user creates transaction in correct format. Please hash this idea through.
Creation of extension block, new transaction format creation is avoidable if you want to fix transaction malleability. Whole idea is written with few short sentences. You never explain full segwit technical details short like that. Why you support unnecessarily complicating everything?
Thoughts about transaction malleability fixing stopped at verifying stack size after script execution and future extensions. You can fix malleability for not segwit transactions too and add exception to not check empty script signature field to preserve future extensions.
Enormous time was spent to develop segwit. Fix transaction malleability for every user and deploy segwit with its true intentions for layer two, not because it is malleability fix. Or you can continue to do nothing to rethink conclusions.

What community? Group that used to be community is torn into pieces. Are you talking about exchanges?
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:33:42
Economic majority does not supports Segwit nor BU if we look at hashate distribution and that portion is going to be minority if it already is not. At least four times less blocks will be big "so be it" issue for weeks at the creation of BU chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:54:25
I thought BU hashpower started to fall like classic or xt rock reading these scary posts.
@_date: 2017-03-06 02:04:39
Any existing testnet with LN transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:31:52
Time for 256 bit secured pubkey hashes that are currently not relayed. I told you so at  long time ago. Ripemd160 increases brute force success by about 2^96 times compared to plain pubkeys. About one with 30 zeroes times easier to lose bitcoins. Pretty big number, huh?
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:21:02
Altcoin promotion on the top of This must be wrong subreddit for that. Edit: or you guys have lost your mind. Lets do not supress promotion of all bitcoin spinoffs.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:35:25
Peter Rizun does not seem to control any hashpower? He can tell anything he wants without representing any miner but themself. You jumped on his trap thinking BU miners are his pets.

Good luck hacking into my computer minixp live session without network connection. Windows 10 users' computers would be hacked from everywhere with these forced updates.

No side cares more than their own interest if we talk about money and especially about bitcoin. Neither side cares significantly more or less about bitcoin economic majority if either side need to abuse opponents equally hard and nothing changes.
Therefore and have similar ~~bad actor~~ economic significant user influence and that tweet has copy paste quality and no signs of independent opinion.

Why turn bitcoin into ethereum like crypto which changes whenever wind blows? Costs nothing for you to create a new bitcoin spinoff.

You are describing two separate transactions: Peter sends bitcoin to Joe and includes document hash in transaction, then Joe spends received bitcoin as he likes.

Can I have your prototype for POW upgrade?

Idea is good as its bitcoin node implementation. Do you have it?
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:31:53
Joe sends transaction to you with document hash and you then foward received coins to people of your choice.
PS. Any document can be duplicated infinite times if you have a copy.
@_date: 2017-04-12 21:01:10
I doubt your knowledge how bitcoin node stores blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:57:29
I had similar issue on hard disk drive. I recovered affected file with Non-Stop Copy v1.04 (it is older than Bitcoin and still works) and replaced zeroes with correct data.

Big upvote from me.

Point of UASF appears to fork no matter what other miners say. Most likely miners will not upgrade and see what happens because of this "fuck you" poster.

You might know some of my thoughts:
Use damn code to tell transistors to broadcast transactions not your imagination.
Bitcoin have self-contradicting properties and there is nothing wrong with it. Make your dreams real and i'll make my dreams real.

Was reading somewhere about TB storage requirements to set up blockchain explorer. My addrindex enabled full node can do the same much more compactlyWas
@_date: 2016-10-21 23:35:34
Probably a good idea to heat up testnet node.
Edit: 0.13.0 node on testnet returns new raw tx format in backwards incompatible way and standard raw tx format appears to be irretrievable when segwit went active. It is a joke, ?
