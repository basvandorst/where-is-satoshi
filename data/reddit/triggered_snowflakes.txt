I still prefer to use moderated p2p exchanges like paxful as there is something goes wrong a human is there to help in a few minutes 
@_date: 2019-06-03 19:33:17
where the offers at?
there are none
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:40:04
no thanks, tried it and got chargebacked by some nigerian scammer
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:13:22
Why dont you give it to me then if its not either A or B
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:52:12
paxful by far
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:38:25
wow thats so interesting, and you dont need to show ID or anything? 
I need to move there
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:00:37
Don't bother, they have zero liquidity.
Paxful is the only other P2P exchange with real volume 
the numbers are here: 
even bisq is dead as all their liquidity is coin to coin trades
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:14:34
why are you in every post related to them
are you affiliated or just shilling them ?
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:17:37
in the app? I dont see anything and i use it daily
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:51:34


Paxful is the only other exchange on this list with volume 
Oh and the guy is wrong about needing to KYC, you only need to KYC over 1500 USD
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:01:31
again is this in the app
im on ios and there is only 4 sections.
balance, accounts, transactions settings
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:58:40
Im sorry please show me how much liquidity there is for local cash sales on bisq. 
I'm waiting (just as long as im waiting for that shitty app to eat all my battery as it takes 20 minutes to load with 100% CPU use)
what are you mining monero while it doesn't load, seems like a scam to me
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:39:02
no, your argument is way off the point.
what you are saying is I should go sell my coins on some exchange that nobody has really heard about vs the one where people are actively selling for cash which is paxful.
your argument is I should use bitchute over youtube just because its peer to peer when in fact nobody will see my video or anything there.
the cash trade will go where the volume is and I already showed you after localbitcoins that volume is on paxful

bisq has zero liquidity and I wont touch it
