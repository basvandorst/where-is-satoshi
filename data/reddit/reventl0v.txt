well, you can rollback, but people can detect the rollback. If you just add, in your code, a way to disagree about branches when you see one of your blocks (that has been confirmed by N blocks on top of it) disappearing, no problem, nope ?

Not only :) You can rely on cryptography as well, but for that, you have to have something to trust. In Peercoin, thoses are centrally broadcast checkpoints that are signed by the developper private key. This breaks the decentralization of the blockchain, but, good news, you can do the same with your *own* private key, and by replicating the state of the blockchain.
People won't be able to tamper with the blockchain without you noticing (or without breaking the assumption you can forge hash).
For that, yeah, you need to decide there is a legit state of the chain at some point. You can argue anybody that man-in-the middle you from the rest of the internet can trick you into considering a fake legit state of the chain at some point. But, well, the same thing happen with PoW blockchains :)

Well they are immutable if you use cryptographic signatures that you trust into the process. If you mine a block and suppose your own signature cannot be forged, then you validate everything before that block: any alteration before this point won't work.
To get immutability, you have to be involved and "trust yourself". No ?
