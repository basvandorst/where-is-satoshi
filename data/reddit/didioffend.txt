Well he did vouch for mt.gox. No that's not the logic you fucking idiot. But doesn't say much for the bitcoin community when you have trash like you peddling scum like roger ver as an expert.


Of course. But you have to be quite a fucking moron to be convicted for selling firecrackers. 


What a fucking moron. Is that supposed to be impressive? Reads like gibberish a rebellious teenager wrote. He even whines that only he got punished like a little teenager.
Honestly, when trash like you and roger ver are gone, maybe people can take the bitcoin community seriously.

Holy shit has gone retarded. Comparing roger ver to mlk, oscar schindler and harriet tubman.
A stupid moron too dumb to sell firecrackers legally = MLK...
You are a fucking joke.

Honestly, scum like you are worse than shills like roger ver. 
You can watch what roger ver said.
Roger Ver BLAMED the banks for the problems at mt.gox... If he was that wrong about mt.gox, why are you peddling his interviews here? 


Who is he? He's just your run of the mill moron who got convicted for selling firecrackers from his apartment. The guy is a loser desperate to make money off of other morons on He's nothing but a snake oil salesman.
