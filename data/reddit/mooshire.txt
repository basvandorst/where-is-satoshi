Tomorrow is the 4th of July. A formidable coalition of Internet Defense League members will launch the largest online protest since SOPA, to amplify the Restore the Fourth street protests happening around the country and call for an end to illegal U.S. Government spying.

If you don’t have a website:
Click here to join our Thunderclap -- our goal is to reach 10 Million people on July 4th and we’re already more than half-way there!
The coalition is HUGE. Reddit, 4chan, Mozilla, Namecheap, Imgur, Fark, iFixit, Cheezburger, TOR Project, and thousands of others sites are helping, plus groups like the EFF, Demand Progress, OpenMedia, Downsize DC, Occupy Wall St NYC, and MoveOn.

Hello, glad to help with all I know. (If someone notices I am wrong, please correct me)
1)Yes; there is a feature on vircurex.com called stoporders. These will let you set prices to buy/sell at, and can expire on dates/times.
2)I think they will try, but I cannot say what the outcome will be.
4)This is possible afaik, but due to the amount of people that want bitcoin to grow heathily and succeed, combined with the current number of miners, I can never see this happening.
5)I cannot answer this, I am no good with economic theory.
@_date: 2013-03-17 00:52:36
Nice job, but for the lazier out there, if you look up an address on blockchain.info, there's a button to create a donation button, just HTML to paste into a website, generates a random address that sends to your address. Notifies people when their payment has been recieved. Cons related to this: Not multiple language, only accepts BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:19:18
You're correct, but that doesn't mean that blockchain.info doesn't have horrendous customer service. They NEVER respond to any kind of emails, its terrible.

I would go around to local stores and ask them if they accept bitcoins, and if they don't, persuade them by offering them a hefty startup sum (.0.5-1 BTC). By doing that I could get 100-200 more businesses to accept bitcoins and raise public awareness while making it easier to shop for goods with less fees for the merchant.

The script does just what the site does, it keeps a record in a database of all of the deposits and pays out interest accordingly. The point is that that's there just for legal purposes. The admin is not "shady". I've talked to him for a while and he is a very trustworthy person, he also runs

You can use the server texture feature of minecraft to achieve this with an unused texture, like sponges. A simple bukkit mod to spawn these underground would work, you would just be spawning sponges underground, and when you mined the sponge you got some other unused item re-textured to look like a bitcoin that you can redeem at a chest or with a command.
