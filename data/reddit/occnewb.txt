Most dev's these days don't do any C/C++, and have limited experience with it in higher ed, if at all. Sure C++ is slightly newer than C, but if you knew C, learning C++ is not hard, so I don't really see the point this tangent is trying to make. I guess it depends what you define as "young" because chances are, unless your in your mid 30's or older now, C/C++ was probably not your first real programming language to learn, you probably learned Java first.

Not a hoax at all. I was pretty sure it was an address, I was not sure if it was a private or public key, so I did not want to search the address on the blockchain if it was a private key, for obvious reasons.
There is nothing I can say to "prove" it besides that I am a dev, and so I was aware of it in the relatively early days, and I dabbled with mining btc briefly, right around the time people started to realize gpu's were better at it.

Actually, yeah, your right, looking at any random alpha numeric string, I did not know (or remember) if it was a private or public key which is exactly why I asked the question, dude. I stored it in keypass all those years ago, and never look again at it till recently.

Yeah, this is all depressing. I seem to recall having &gt;0 from mining, but this address is definitely 0. Might of kept that address because I was thinking about trying web payments back then. Thanks again. I did not want to search for the address until I knew it was an address, and not a private key.

It's not buying or HODLing that's the problem, it's selling. If people would rather sell their BTC for fiat than to spend it, that's the problem.  
You will create more value in BTC if you spend instead of sell for fiat. Simple economics really.
