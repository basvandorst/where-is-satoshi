Except your long winded post conveniently skips the important point which is Bitcoin does not only compete with currency. For example, it is objectively better than gold in virtually every aspect. Gold has a market cap of approx. 7 trillion.

I have to interject and say that the Greek people also contributed directly to their current situation. Tax evasion in Greece is half-jokingly considered a national sport.
"The OECD estimated in August 2009 that the size of the Greek grey market to be around €65bn (equal to 25% of GDP), resulting each year in €20bn of unpaid taxes."
That is an eye-watering sum for a country the size of Greece.

Gold price has been carefully controlled by central banks the world over for many years, through orchestrating the supply and production as well as the creation of a paper gold future derivative in the 70s.
It's immensely more difficult to short a decentralized asset such as Bitcoin, particularly without the assistance of 'fractional-reserve' finance, where only a small fraction of the underlying assets have to be held.

Technology evolves, rapidly. Bitcoin being the particularly disruptive technology that it is, prioritizes decentralization, censorship resistance and security over the latest gimmicks by design. "Feature, not bug."

Humans are terrible when it comes to trying to comprehend exponential development.
Just as the internet scaled to stream HD media content easily (which was beyond unthinkable in the early days), so too Bitcoin will scale to handle transactions per second that will blow companies like Visa out of the water. We will have store of value as well as the ability to process millions of micro-transactions.

We have an official subreddit for this at r/BitcoinBeggars
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:37:44
You're right, gold and bitcoin can't be compared directly. In fact, bitcoin opens up a whole new segment unable to be fulfilled by gold. Store of value without having to worry about expensive security, storage and other associated costs. Many 'gold bugs' have already started to diversify into crypto and I see no reason for this trend to stop gaining momentum. There is no reason why bitcoin can't match and even surpass the current marketcap of gold. The reason gold is chosen as a comparison is because the use cases are similar.
As a currency (medium of exchange) Bitcoin is pretty bad at the moment. It's impossible to accurately price anything (unit of account) with this kind of price volatility. That will change with increased adoption and liquidity - in fact the volatility of bitcoin has continued to decrease over time and is in fact currently less volatile than at least 100 other national currencies. Furthermore once the scalability issues are resolved with L2 solutions and we are conducting 10x and 100x more transactions per second than companies such as Visa / Mastercard we will see bitcoin able to adopt the currency use case.
Other cryptos are much less interesting for me due to centralization, small development teams, founders taxes, premines, etc.
@_date: 2018-08-31 10:54:34
Bullshit. Other coins are useless for remittance because there's no volume. Try exchanging thousands of dollars worth of shitcoins on an exchange and then you'll realize you can't do anything except get royally screwed because the whole exchange does 50k USD or less in daily volume on that particular coin. Nothing can touch Bitcoin for liquidity.

The only aggressor in this scenario is Roger Ver - with his continuous hostile takeover attempts, the most recent incarnation being bcash.
Richard Heart should have ripped him to shreds and exposed his complete lack of technical understanding. In the end we just had to listen to Roger's incessant derp derp about big blocks and fees which rendered the whole exercise rather pointless. Richard was in fact the 'civilized' one, for lack of a better term.

Hopefully he will fritter away his remaining BTC on futile takeover attempts such as bcash and wither away quietly somewhere. This might take a while since he never actually puts his money where his mouth is, just manipulates other people to lose their own.

Ok let me deconstruct your original bullshit post. The difference between 1mb and 2mb is negligble in relation to "millions of transactions" and "cups of coffee". 2mb does not bring you anywhere near the capacity required for that kind of volume. Layer 2 solutions are essential for that kind of daily throughput.
The only thing 2mb brings is more centralization and less nodes, which is exactly what the corporates want.

Welcome :). My advice to you as a newbie is to not worry too much about the drama that takes place on Reddit, rather focus on the fundamentals.
Personally I would occupy myself with YouTube videos about Bitcoin produced by or featuring Andreas Antonopoulos, Nick Szabo and Richard Heart. That should be more than enough content to get you familiar with the fundamentals.
Enjoy the ride!

Terrible platform. First of all it's a CFD platform, so you're not owning any actual BTC (this in itself doesn't make the platform terrible, but I would advise on using a real exchange), the main issue is that they are extremely shady with regards to withdrawing your funds. I myself had about $1k USD which took me over 30 days to withdraw. After that horrible experience I vowed never to trade with them again. Beware!
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:41:32
You are not buying bitcoin on those platforms you are trading using CFDs, essentially betting on whether the price will go up (long position) or down (short position).
If you want to actually own bitcoin I suggest using a reputable online exchange, and if you plan to acquire significant amounts invest in a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:53:55
Good job, this is all your fault
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:27:58
No I did not suggest the platforms you mentioned are not reputable, although I do have a negative experience with Avatrade (took me almost 30 days to withdraw my money from them, after that I decided never to use them again).
On Avatrade and eToro, you are not actually buying or owning any Bitcoin. You are only entering into a contract for difference (CFD) and betting that the price of Bitcoin will either go up or down. There is a huge difference between actually buying and owning Bitcoin and trading with CFDs.
I don't know about Lebanon specifically but you can try to register with a popular exchange such as Coinbase or Poloniex. You can use your credit card to start making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency purchases. Failing that, you can try a website such as localbitcoins.com to try and source your Bitcoin locally. Be aware that this service usually comes at a premium (generally several hundred dollars above the spot price) as you are buying from individuals looking to make money trading Bitcoin.

I'm a big believer in Ethereum. 25% of my crypto portfolio is made up of ETH. However, the events occurring in the ICO space are very worrying. Hundreds of millions of dollars being thrown around at half baked projects with no practical use cases and only flimsy white papers to support them. What is going to happen when the first of these failed projects start dumping their ETH and their respective owners ride off into the sunset? A mass chain of destruction. I'm all for deregulation and decentralization but when this kicks off it will be a truly seismic series of events, which will take a long time to recover from. Some of the damage may be irreversible.
