a phone wallet does take like 2 minutes to download to be fair
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:30:47
id assume its way faster for a phone wallet to be acquired. 
dont think you see much malware there.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:09:44
seems odd to assume he has thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin
why add the last part five hours later ?
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:37:25
yo your post history says you lost funds, over300 btc on my gox and 54 cents on quadriga. 
how many have u lost in a hacked phone wallet?

but now you have two locations it can be found. And both of them give you access to the account cause brute forcing half is not half as easy it’s like 99% easier
Stop trying to roll your own crypto.

it didnt seem like he was trying to be hostile at all

listen to this friend. There’s not much risk to using custodial exhanges if you can limit the time the bitcoin is on the exchange. Buy it then send it out 
@_date: 2019-11-06 21:09:50
Understandable, have a great day.

who shat in your cheerios, mate?

they only asked me for ID when I withdrew it from the cashapp. You can buy it and keep it in their app without ID
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:18:57
That's a roller coaster, they absolutely ended lower than they started
@_date: 2019-10-11 15:23:20
5 minutes. lmao

energy usage is directly tied to the difficult and the number of miners. The answer is there are more miners. 
If only one computer was mining with a gpu. The system would be fine. But then you would just need to spin up one more system with a gpu to effectively print bitcoins

lol what kind of medium did u store it on? Was it a FAT drive or NTFS.
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:54:13
dang, I got more BTC than ole musky boy
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:58:11
you’re a comp sci grad student ? we need u to keep reading about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:04:36
not sure if I’m understanding you correctly. you seem to be saying why don’t we use cash settled banks?
deposit cash to online custodial acct. 
get instant “btc” (not really. Since they own the fiat and the keys, you are just depositing cash)
custodial account pays merchants in fiat. 
this seems like a bank account. 
I guess you mention the value being tied to bitcoin rather than cash. so it’s like an investment in bitcoin that’s instantly cash settled when you spend from your custodial wallet.

I did this when buying some software two weeks ago. Gave me an hour to confirm at current prices. I set a 5 sat/byte fee. Got a little nervous. Made some food. Came back and it confirmed in 45 minutes. Missed two blocks. Fee was like 20 cents.

You won’t have the chance brother.

Careful there. See the forest for the trees. It could encourage green tech sure. But I think people have more confidence in their ability to create abundant energy then to create ever more efficient devices. I personally think that believing bitcoin will drive efficient tech is wrong. 
There’s big arguments that bitcoin using energy is a staple of its strength. As that physical limitation gives rise to the strength bitcoin has to be immutable.

sure. just like the safety on a gun. but coinbase still holds your gun.
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:07:56
gonna go against the hive mind here. lie to her to get her back. buy in at increments of like 20% a time. don’t tell her. win win win
bitcoin can’t suk suk

use a third party block explorer and your ping  and transaction id is likely to be logged, linking you.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:00:48
Or it could be not gone. I’m really not sure
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:18:30
let’s think. Does amazon accept money right now? Yes. And what do they do with it? They spend it. 
That’s probably what they would do.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:19:37
what was the answer you got ?
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:05:17
it’s impossible to track when there is no provided information. You should use a block explorer with the transaction information you got.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:19:27
p sure he meant bitcoin bro 
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:02:45
