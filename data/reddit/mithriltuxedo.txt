It's been less than a month since they said they were working on it.

Coinbase says they'll be adopting Segwit this year.

You remind me of my uncle sometimes when he gets drunk and tries to argue with me on facebook and his phone's voice recognition can't quite deal with his slurring.

Someone (or I) should keep a running scatterplot of these things associated with usernames and plot it out like  but call it a bag of dicks, or dickbag, or something like that.
edit: Have a bagbot match predictions in the format posted by OP and update the dick bag.

Who better to ask that wouldn't be biased? Someone working on ASIC-resistance?
Who's asking for unbiased opinion anyway? The author is upfront about their association.

These posts have been making me nervous for similar reasons. Reassurances make me suspicious.

For now it's overwhelmingly for the block reward. The transition to purely fee-based block rewards is what the halvening does.
Mining difficulty is directly linked to hash power. The difficulty is adjusted to account for hash power. That keeps the block discovery rate close to the average one every ten minutes, no matter what the hash power of the system is.
Mining reward is inversely related to the hash power of the system for any one mining node in the system. The reward basically dictates how much electricity is spent on mining.

What are their interest rates like?

You can still send BTC to Wikileaks, you just won't see a Coinbase app embedded in a webpage for doing so. Wikileaks is going to have to generate their own wallets.
Coinbase took their name off the Wikileaks donation page is how I'm reading this.

It would be problematic for bitcoin if hash power affected the rate too significantly, but you've pointed out where that might happen. The hash power of the random selection process has consistently been increasing, but when/if it stabilizes or drops the opposite will happen.
I hadn't considered before that if half the mining nodes on the network dropped out (natural disaster, war, virus, etc.), the block discovery rate would be halved and that network state could last up to four weeks.
You're absolutely right: the rate of block discovery is accelerated by the addition of hash power. I wasn't observing that the difficulty curve lags behind the hash power curve.

Plus, Wikileaks is complaining about a Coinbase-specific feature Coinbase won't let them use anymore. Nothing prevents me from sending Wikileaks BTC via Coinbase, this just makes it more difficult for the less bitcoin savvy to do so.

The block discovery rate averages out to one every 10 minutes. Every 2016 blocks the difficulty is readjusted up (or down) to keep the discovery rate where it should be as the hash rate changes.

That's the single exchange CBOE derives their XBT futures spot price from, as opposed to multiple exchanges like CME does for BTC futures.

I used to think the same thing about the rest of the internet, that it was the new wild west  and you really shouldn't be on it if you aren't going to be careful.
That was before someone went to jail for writing the Mellissa virus. When ILOVEYOU happened and Microsoft _still_ wasn't in any legal trouble I realized it wasn't going to be the internet I was hoping for anytime soon.

:-p Most every mobile device is *nix based, and most hosts on the internet are running *nix. Linux couldn't out-Windows what Windows was when it had 90% market share, and I think Microsoft is figuring out they can't either.

He's a bit of a climate change denialist too. That's most of what I know about him, that he takes an anti-intellectual stance about complicated things that aren't in his field of study. He's made an Argument from Ignorance and/or Incredulity about climate science that other people have glommed on to, which isn't good.
