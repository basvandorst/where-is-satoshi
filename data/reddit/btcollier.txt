You're right, I should have a section for explaining what exactly bitcoin is! Nicely spotted :) 


I'm gonna make a section on this. Good point suggesting that! Thanks.

My thought was that his name comes up very often so perhaps it's good to know who he is and why his actions have such an impact on bitcoin stability.

Yeah thanks I'm browsing through the guide, it's a good collection of tips and advice for buying bitcoin. Gotta integrate that info into my handbook - beginners would 100% appreciate this.

Yeah difficult to get lost when there are all these blogs. I've been reading through and will be some info that I can add to the Awesome Bitcoin Handbook. Hope you don't mind?

Yes, Andreas is very inspiring and accurate with this information. He's included in my Awesome Bitcoin Handbook under "bitcoin experts" sections.
