Don’t underestimate those whackos.

All fair points but I’m only arguing against widespread adaption. I just don’t see it happening.

To me, as someone on the sidelines, threads like this are exactly why I think Bitcoin will be worthless eventually. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:38:18
I think they provide a window into the mentality of the market.

I think you are underestimating the number of people that are either indifferent about, empowered or enriched by or part of central banking.

A lack of liquidity for Main Street customers would be fatal. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:53:53
My point exactly... do you regret not investing in Napster?! 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:14:43
So what’s the appeal of Bitcoin then to mainstream consumers over something like that? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:01:26
Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:00:59
Will do. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:00:38
I’m on the sidelines until it becomes touch/tap done with instant transactions and a stable value. No merchants will adapt without these. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:04:11
That’s not my argument. I’m arguing against critical mass adaptation.

Yes it is, but the computing power and energy to cool the systems is very high.

They will cook up some argument showing the amount of fossil fuels used to power the mining as a pretext for taxes and regulation. It sounds crazy but they never miss an opportunity.

It may be great technology but that doesn’t make  Bitcoin a wise investment. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:36:48
Ok. I tried. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:21:40
So by this logic, if my dog ate a $150 Kobe steak, got sick and threw it up, since it cost me $150 the mess on my rug is worth at least that much?

One of the hallmark signs of an irrational bubble is that kind of commentary. Hope you are hedging your bets and have pocketed some gains.

It could be high chargeback ratios. Don’t sleep on that.
