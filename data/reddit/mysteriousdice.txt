Assange's tweet here is hopelessly misguided.
Occupy Wall Street was not just about bank bailouts, it was also about addressing systemic wealth inequality due to capitalism, i.e. "We are the 99%."
Bitcoin is recreating the same old inequalities because it is simply rearranging the demographics of the 1% vs. 99%. Bitcoin may dismantle central banks, but it will also exacerbate global wealth inequality and governments will start asserting their authority in harsher ways as they lose control of the money supply. 
Cryptocurrency is a great technology, but those that believe it is going to automatically lead to some kind of political revolution or solve inequality are living in a techno-utopian fantasy.
