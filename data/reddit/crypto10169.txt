Paypal wanted me to pay them back $1,675.00 that a customer had made payments for services to myself using her fathers credit card without his permission, when the father found out he recalled all the payment and wanted me to refund all the money back to them, even after talking to the girl and the father and both father and daughter admitting to fraud and wrong doing they still wanted to make me liable for paying the money back to them, I told them to shove it down their pie hole, never paid a penny and closed my account, mind you the girl makes bank at her head chef job but they still would not go after her, so much for 15yrs of customer loyalty to them and never making a mistake of doing they wrong, FUCK paypal..

I think he was having a stroke at the simple thought of the word bitcoin, this made me chuckle.. haha.

I swear we here in the US look at this with marvel, the Chinese have been doing this since 2012, 95% of transactions in china are done this way using a cell phone and instant pay, fiat is almost non existence in that country, we are far way behind and its time to catch up..

Like it or not, Bitcoin is here to stay, like the cyborgs say, "Resistance is Futile and you will be assimilated" sooner or later but it will happen.. Rome was not built in a day gentleman, the only regret I have is not following my gut instinct in 2010 and buying 50k worth of Bitcoin which i had sitting in my savings doing nothing earning .02 percent per year, Mind you the only thing that stopped me was my friend was so fucked up on drugs and out of his mind that he didn't call me for a week to set up an account and buy into it and after that i just forgot about it, to this day I give him shit for it.  LOL

Gold can be confiscated by your government just like they did in the 1930's.. not such a great idea because it can happen again..
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:27:37
As price drops more bitcoins will get into the hands of much needed humans around the world which will increase the use of BTC and adoption by a huge margin then the price will slowly climb back up and reach Neptune.. :)

I have a solution for this whale market manipulations, exchanges should have limits as to the amount of BTC a whale can dump at one time or a limit as to time frame when they can buy back in.. BOOM!!! problem solved.. :)

my question is, what is the regulatory role that banks place in fiat currency? Hmmmm makes you wonder..
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:14:16
I am 49, never married no kids, 50% of my wealth is into bitcoin and I am not worried one bit, I bought at several stages beginning at 11k and lower, remember you only take a loss if you sell lower than what you bought, 1 coin is a coin no matter the price, just HODL and you be fine in the long run..

someones daughter i knew committed fraud by using her father credit card to pay me for a personal loan, when her father found out he cancelled all the payments on the credit card but i had already  gotten paid and withdrew the money out to my account, somehow PP wants me to pay the money back to them and made me responsible for the fraudulent charges even thought She the girl after talking with support admitted to the fraud they did not make her responsible and went after her to collect the money owed, instead they came after me and try to make me pay, I told them to fuck off and that i would be closing my account ASAP AFTER 14YRS OF BEING WITH THEM, they send me to collections and to this day i wont pay them a fucking penny of it.. FUCK PayPal..Mind you the even the Father knew his daughter had used his credit card to make payments to me, but without his permission which he then used to do charge backs and claim unauthorized used of his CC..

The money wont go Anywhere because with that type of attack all the money invested in BTC will be lost.

Not buying in 2010 when i first found out about BTC and then Not buying again after silk road got busted and price was at $84 per coin, I had 50K ready to be dropped into it and I didn't do it because a friend messed up the timing..
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:39:52
Its a known fact men take more risk than women, but i am sure you will find it more meaningful spending the BTC your future man will have in his wallet.
