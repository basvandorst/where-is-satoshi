1. not a new problem. Electrum servers and most blockchain explorers are DOSable.
2. not a new problem. storage space reqs for running Electrum server and most blockchain explorers already approaching ~100GB. VerSum doesn't cache the computation, just the outcome. computation performed once then result memoized.
3. odds become increasingly good of one honest server existing as number of servers increases. and there is no better alternative. DOS all servers and client can't connect. you would have to forcefully compromise all servers. not even one honest server could be left standing. the chances of this occuring in concert with having the client make a network connection nonethewiser are vanishingly tiny. DOS and you can't connect. compromise all servers simultaneously? still can't send assets you don't own. can't match orders without requisite balances. full nodes would reject. biggest danger is fraudulent $ASSET-to-Bitcoin-pubaddress return vals, but Counterparty =/= Namecoin =/= OneName. address aliasing costs 0.5 XCP, too expensive and won't be done at scale
Counterparty thin clients primarily need remote servers for balance lookups to pre-validate mktx step. do you have the needed balance of Counterparty $ASSET, if yes, then tx is valid, sign &amp;&amp; broadcast. think: distributed exchange order placement, named asset creation, asset sending, asset info lookups. broadcasting data onto blockchain for BTC fee, issuing numeric assets for BTC fee can be done without a remote Counterparty server.
