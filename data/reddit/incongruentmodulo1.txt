Thanks for the response. That's an interesting website, but I was curious more about your personal use, if you feel like sharing. I'd also be interested in what you do for work that pays entirely in bitcoin (mining seems like the most likely).
I'm interested in hearing more about your issues with fiat currency. Have you had payments blocked with other services? If so, can you tell me why? What makes you feel privacy is so important? Also, isn't it true that if someone knows your bitcoin address, they can identify every transaction you've ever been a party in, using the block chain?
I'm especially interested in your complaint about central banks' control over the money supply. Is this a practical issue or a principled opposition? Inflation in the United States has been below historic averages for the past few years, even more so in the EU, so I'm guessing you live somewhere besides those places, correct?

Hi, thanks for responding. You mention you bought 100 bitcoins at $130. Have you cashed out any of those paper profits yet? If not, at what level would you do so?
I'm especially interested in this comment:


Is this more of a gut feeling about the risk, or have you made some estimates for future prices? Could you share some basic predictions? It could even be the percent chance of a high price and a low price in a few years, e.g. in five years, there is a 50% chance the price is $10,000 and a 50% chance the price is $10.
