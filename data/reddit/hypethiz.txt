because their currency will have built in functionality designed to suit their specific needs

because I would assume in the future this is how business will operate... theory in progress 
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:44:13
well why are gift cards useful? there are tons of businesses that operate on a credit currency type of basis as well.. increases spending and consumerism.
as far as functionality, perhaps it can be used to mitigate returns and exchange processes in some fashion.
My theory is that it would be in a company’s best interest to have their own unique currency because it allows them more control over their money, whether it’s directly beneficial to the consumer or not. 
I don’t think we have the technology at this point in time for this type of system to be viable, but i think we will be headed that way in the next  15 or so years

exactly what i’m saying. i feel as this is the next step for commerce

why would it not add to usefulness for USD if it is directly based off bitcoin price (similar to a dollar based on gold) ?

When you say maintained, are you referring to miners? 
Can the current bitcoin block chain be upgraded to protect against vulnerabilities? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:14:55
like the way you think.. but the simulation we live in is just animal farm repeating itself 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:42:09
when you say sidechain, does that mean another fork?
can you give a dumbed down explanation of lightening network?

i’m not saying all currencies will be centralized in the future. If there is a good use case for a specifically decentralized coin, i’m sure that coin will be available to people somehow. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:07:57
we are either looking at 20k or 8k by the end of the year.. You should think about how much you are willing to risk and adjust accordingly.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:22:55
I don’t see how bitcoin will be able to remain secure in the future as an actual global currency, especially when quantum computing is not too far in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:25:07
Do you recall any altcoins that are significantly different from bitcoin in some way?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:05:50
bitcoin is still a very good investment at this point, whether you are going long or swinging it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:26:19
It seems to me that institutional investors want cheap bitcoin.. and that’s what we’re being hit with right now. 
I feel bitcoin is still very bullish.. this bubble is not ready to burst until banks are happy with the money they made. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:14:10
correct me if i’m wrong, but wouldn’t mining become obsolete once bitcoin reaches maximum circulation?
Or is there some sort of incentive for miners to continue mining well after the limit is reached
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:44:21
surely cryptocurrencies that are not truly decentralized still have use cases that solve many existing problems with money? such as making the potential of human error impossible. 
I imagine in the future, large companies will have fully implemented their own blockchain technologies wherever it is applicable.
As for currency, as long as they are all backed by a single thing like gold, many different currencies can still exist, like they do today.
In my opinion i feel as though it will quickly get to the point that every company will have their own coin in which they do business with, each designed to do very specific things. However there will still be a solid store of wealth currency used as the standard. 
I’m wondering what other peoples take is on a future like this 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:22:10
 I feel like when it comes to tech, things are improving exponentially. do we have any reason to believe that bitcoin as a currency will remain viable in the next 60 years? there are some very avid bitcoin supporters that seem to believe that it will.. but it seems questionable.

What did he do???
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:52:24
He already said he had some sort of medical condition that makes his body fidget.. on top of that he’s been in the hospital a couple of times... maybe he already knows that he’s expected to die soon because of his condition?
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:42:16
no that’s why I asked the question 
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:42:00
No article, nobody ever mentioned it either.. just been on my mind since December 
The guy looks extremely sickly
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:58:06
exactly that’s why i’m saying because of his age and bad health, he can really make any sort of “bet” without following through on the terms of it.
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:04:59
I’m not sure how involved he has been in those projects lately, he recently gave up ownership of MGT capital investments so he could focus on other things.. in my opinion it seems to me like he is more the face of his projects more than he is the arms working behind it if that make sense 
@_date: 2018-08-06 05:30:43
I understand that much but you’re saying him being potentially sick has nothing to do with it?
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:03:43
personally, i would prefer people to stop talking about bitcoin altogether for a long while... even if that means prices go down to stop the fluctuation. I think that’s ultimately what’s keeping new investors out because they are comparing it to traditional stocks... they don’t understand that btc price history is radically different from most other things
