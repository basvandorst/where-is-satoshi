Just asked Live Support. For the moment, yes. But their plan is to expand into UK and Europe (Probably UK first) by Jan - Mar.

Well, realistically, yes he could. The real question you should ask is could he send that money to you right now whilst not finding out any new information about your personal life?

Serious question though: Is Bitcoin dying? I got so excited about Bitcoin when I first learnt of it, but couldn't afford investing in it.
Then the big crash happened due to Mt.Gox going away, and I got scared to start again. It's such a cool idea though! Is it worth investing now? Will it go up? Is mining viable?

Fair enough, maybe it's one of those things that only stock marketers can somewhat guess... It seems really cheap to buy into though, so I may force my way through!
At the very least, it would be cool if it became the unofficial-official currency of Reddit.
And heh. Boobs.

Wait, what about Shakespeare? Everyone knows who Shakespeare was. He wasn't a secret man.
