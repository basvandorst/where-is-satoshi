Check out what the site wants for validation. Lol

Her boyfriend messaged me once they realized I knew it was a scam. I found out he plays Dcs world, flight Sim. He said he would shoot down my f18 with his mig29, if he gets the chance.

I don't have a pic as she unmatched me on Tinder after switching to whatsapp.
The crypto she talked about was PCT on add-ex.io
She went by Tiny/Amy

Can someone ELI5 this post to me.
Does he mean police morality?

I got her to click a link to a page I have so I could capture her ip. she's  logged on with a Google cloud VPN.

They switch to whattsap or whatever. Send photos, voice chat even. At some point share a screenshot of the crypto going up steadily.

Is that the gold backed one

They exploit your FOMO really, they don't make you do anything.  But they talk about how well PCT is doing, which you can only buy at [add-ex.io]( which is a scam site.

The longer you lead her on the more you save others.
@_date: 2019-11-10 02:26:19
They mention their success casually. Basically they invoke your curiosity. When you ask details they share a crypto on a fake exchange site that is fairly robust looking.
Anything you "buy" on that site is really a donation.

I see millions of stolen bitcoin in the news every few months it seems.
The method of attack probably doesn't matter to those who lost.

Just for perspective, what percentage of your net worth is that now?
