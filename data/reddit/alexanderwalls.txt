WHAT?!?!?! ������
@_date: 2019-07-25 00:54:54
It actually worked ‼️��
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:39:44
I’ve created it. Now how do I link it to my Reddit account and accept the SATS?
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:42:09
I see it. When I click it a message thread opens and I don’t know what to write...
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:30:51

The decoupling...
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:10:01
Nope, it didn’t PM me. But I PM’d you because I need help .
@_date: 2019-07-27 20:39:34
Every time I click the bot i have to write a username, subject, then message. It seem really confusing to me.  Everything is blank..,
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:00:41
This thread is golden ��
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:37:28
How do I start ?
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:58:24
Lol take care troll
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:06:08
Looks like a hollow tip
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:36:02
You need to be educated 
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:17:41
Let him take it as a joke... he’ll soon regret it
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:06:17
Why no Litecoin?
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:58:40
So you didn’t put any in alts?
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:15:32
Looks like he converted his crypto to fiat...
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:33:42
It’ll make since to buy now... if it going lower than expected put more in until you have whole one... $300 isn’t a big difference 
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:00:08
I’m waiting for Litecoin to hit these prices. Bitcoin will hopefully do this soon
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:21:11
I can tell you’re down in your investments ��
@_date: 2018-05-12 18:58:24
Why Ethereum??? 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:00:51
And then eventually it’ll rot
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:47:40
Am I wrong ?
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:09:48
And if I ever go broke imma take your money!
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:55:15
Lmao why did you have to say the last part ��
@_date: 2018-05-12 18:59:15
I invest in CryptoCURRENCIES
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:28:04
I don’t see that ....
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:24:42
Good luck my friend!! I’m planning on doing the same with Litecoin &amp; Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:25:32
Use a vending machine 
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:27:56
You’re totally right

He doesn’t 
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:19:06
Or he will  have one soon!
@_date: 2019-03-10 22:50:07
Why don’t you want to use KYC?
@_date: 2019-03-18 03:46:08
Why not?
@_date: 2019-03-18 14:52:42
I was about to say ������
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:54:19
Post like this should be trending..

Are you looking to trade or buy? Two different things..
@_date: 2019-11-09 04:51:26
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:37:30
Is this real?!?!
@_date: 2019-11-09 04:47:29
Cash app isn’t for trading, only buying crypto.
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:43:29
That’s what I thought 
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:28:16
Go outside.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:32:27
Only the top 5% would 
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:56:25
Listen to the guy above and don’t be dumb
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:55:15
Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:56:49
The American government created Bitcoin. Satoshi was most likely a group of people from the U.S military 
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:58:52
Does that even have a correlation ?
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:00:46
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:17:06
Don’t do that‼️ why are you investing to crypto just to use a debit card ?!?! That’s the past.... In a few years we will use BITCOIN. Just HODL then spend when the technology is here and you will be able to use the right tools to spend it 
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:27:05
That is definitely bullish... my mom called me in February and asked about Bitcoin. Don’t listen to naysayers.. they will regret selling or not buying at these levels.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:55:13
That’s not using Bitcoin if your using a debit card ‼️ all you’re doing is selling your Bitcoin into fiat through the transaction. You’re not using the lighting network 
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:15:56
You’ll never receive the money‼️ How else?!?!
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:53:14
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:21:56
So you’re trying to say false advertising in return for Bitcoin isn’t considered a scam?!?! If you don’t then you need some help 
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:55:12
Heard someone got scammed doing that 
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:42:35
Cannot stress this enough..
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:46:54
After that initial first pump everyone else that fomo’d in definitely are the sheep
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:43:46
It will not repeat simply because exchanges didn’t get hacked to a high degree like it did in 2014
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:37:25
So you know him personally or are you listening to other people 
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:46:18
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:39:02
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:29:01
How and why would it be illegal?
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:00:39
Not really but I get it...
@_date: 2019-10-24 02:22:23
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:28:13
No! Is he implying Bitcoin is a company?!?!
@_date: 2019-08-01 02:27:55
I’m sure people have done that with crypto lol
@_date: 2019-10-08 22:17:42
Go outside
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:40:44
What a joke
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:29:37
Right ! Comparing Satoshi to a fiat = disaster 
@_date: 2019-10-18 03:36:47
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:19:34
Use a debit card!
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:58:41
Regulations 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:50:33
Heck no!!
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:02:27
Lambo’s wouldn’t be a luxury then...
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:32:04
I’m glad I’m an early adopter ����
@_date: 2019-06-03 19:08:49
That was the end of the bull run!
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:55:29
Send some to my address :
@_date: 2019-10-18 03:31:01
Why you mad? You must’ve lost money recently..
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:49:53
You’re welcome
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:45:02
No way...

Dollar cost average
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:03:42
Buy a Ledger Nano X or S. A YouTube video will teach you how to use it .
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:05:54
Why would they do that if they can just accept USD?!?!
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:30:00
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:08:35
Should’ve DCA’d
@_date: 2019-06-09 22:06:27
Get REKT
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:26:12
Put it in a cold storage
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:56:43
This comments in this section makes me want to buy due to the uncertainty in the market. If you asked this question 4 months ago everyone here would be moon boys.
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:52:28
Copy and paste?
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:04:44
You’ll regret selling ������
@_date: 2019-06-01 13:01:11
If you’re going to Dollar Cost average than do that. There’s no way “to buy the dip” if you can’t tell when the dip is there.
@_date: 2019-12-09 04:58:01
I thought you gain BTC lol
@_date: 2019-12-09 05:03:00
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:26:35
Don’t reevaluate Bitcoin. Reevaluate your investment strategies.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:05:47
Ledger nano X
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:06:16
Ledger definitely has a mobile app. DYOR!
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:34:20
You’re a smart man.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:10:40
@_date: 2019-04-23 04:22:42
I heard they were sending it out this summer.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:52:13
It’ll go into TRON
@_date: 2019-04-28 04:16:15
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:21:45
Get a cold storage wallet
@_date: 2019-08-02 01:49:57
Looks solid to me ����
@_date: 2019-12-14 03:12:09
Stuff like this gets overlooked
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:59:52
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:00:32
Done! Can I see the results after?
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:24:53
Only CZ can.
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:01:01
Change your password

I’m sorry this happened but it’s irreversible

@_date: 2018-07-07 18:03:41
You’ll never know 
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:33:06
That’s expensive 
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:01:03
You’re right 
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:01:30
Don’t listen to him wtf...
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:46:27
Download Coinbase
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:19:44
Yes, that is cheaper than the other ones I’ve seen on here but great job! I still haven’t seen one in person yet
@_date: 2018-07-21 17:07:29
I'd love to have it 
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:27:35

I don’t have too, clearly.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:49:42
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:12:05
You sound stupid and took it WAY TOO FAR! Please get a job
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:20:42
Looks like Verge
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:03:41
Why didn’t you buy 
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:46:52
You should went all in @ 110 for Litecoin ‼️
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:37:31
Which can also be used as a DIP‼️
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:59:16
So are you trying to say it can’t be number 
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:59:10
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:06:47
@_date: 2018-12-31 00:08:37
It’s his head .
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:00:22
ASAP ������
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:22:12
That’s the end of the bull run ������
