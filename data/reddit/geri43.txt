It's still pretty scummy. Any money given away or gifted should be considered gone, they shouldn't be able to take it back just because they think the recipient won't use it anymore.

There was no indication that it was a coupon. It appeared in the history like any other transaction, and it was added to your balance. And also, the terms of the giveaway didn't mention that it will expire **after** you receive it:

Yes, and there is nothing in the terms mentioning that the transaction expires after you receive it

On Kraken, I got my withdraw in a few days. But you need to wait at least a month to get verified on that site, and the trading is very slow there.

Yeah, US is pretty good if you are rich. For the common people, good luck getting free education and healthcare in America.

Hi, simple question: If not defaulting is guaranteed, then why can't we (the lender) simply cancel the loan anytime (with the current fees), and let the site internally deal with the borrower?
It would also make the site earn some more profit, because while the lender cancelled his loan, the fee would still increase for the borrower who have to pay it back to the site now.
Also, the borrower will always have enough funds in his margin account to cover any losses. I think the users would have more trust in the lending system if they know they can cancel the loan anytime, and always access their funds.

Even if you are using Windows, at least create a Linux virtual machine for your wallet and encrypt the virtual disk. E.g. Oracle VM is free to use, with built-in disk encryption option.
