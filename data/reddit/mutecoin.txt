I admit that I completely misheard him.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:13:44
I admit that I am wrong, but you are also wrong. It's something like 300 actually. 1.5%
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:39:28
I think coinbase is a great entry point to the crypto market, but I kinda think you're a silly person if you make a purchase of more than a few 1000 because the fees are just unreasonable. Having said that, not many other places let you buy crypto via credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:17:52


Exactly. It takes at least 6 months to get rich in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:43:03
Guys guys guys.
20k of btc on coinbase has 800 dollars in fees.
No thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:41:08
This would be sad, but kinda funny...
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:46:31
I really doubt it had much of an impact
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:12:34
Greece is too small to have a noticeable impact on the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:33:38
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:29:49
Yeah, but they're going to launch another gimmicky ICO like everyone and their grandmother is these days.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:15:09
Coinbase is good for credit/debit card purchases. They are reliable and are probably the easiest way for a beginner to get bitcoin within 30 minutes (or even experience traders who can't wait to transfer cash via other means). I'm gonna pm you a referral for 10 dollars of free bitcoin through coinbase if you like.

It seems extremely likely that BCH will plummet during its first few hours.
I don't know where anyone is going to exchange it though... BCH is currently listed like nowhere.
But how much with BCH be worth after a few days... ???
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:16:49
It's just wrong. Ethereum is not 43% below its peak. He's pulling numbers out of his ass.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:04:13
I said potentially thousands of dollars. You seriously cannot encourage trusting your gut. Bad advice. Trust your research and planning.

Botten doesn't look like buy and Bitcoin doesn't have suffixes in most indo-european languages.
You've managed to make it look hard now!
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:57:07
I'm not sure why you are implying that an investment company will have anything innovative to add to the market.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:42:52
good question.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:25:05
ETC was a movement for immutability. BCH doesn't represent anything.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:02:01
Sounds like a back door in the short-term if there is an issue with segwit. I have not been around that long, no. BCH doesn't get much credit within the community is what I've observed. What has it going for it?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:50:15
I suspect you have something more to add?
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:47:50
Kraken is quite good...
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:34:57
Man, this is going to make buying goats so much easier!
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:20:03
Coinbase charge high fees. It's best to trade through gemini or kraken or some other exchange. The upside with coinbase is that it's very easy to use, and very easy to pay via credit card.
If you want a coinbase referral for 10 dollars of bitcoin just pm me. I recommend it to anyone who wants to make their first purchase without having to worry about the fees.
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:05:57
Well they are hardly making a crypto because they have a good idea. They are thinking money first, idea later...
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:12:08
Keep in mind the odds of the reverse order or other similar yet equally suspicious permutations.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:31:00
So.... they're gonna make a gimmicky crypto to make money? Same as everyone?
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:47:17
This makes me sad. Some may benefit from this, but some will get destroyed.
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:12:49


I don't think everything OP chose went down. That's insane. I personally think this is a pity story for PMss offering bitcoin donations. 
Also, just at a glance, ethereum is not down 43. It's at most down 30% if he bought at the very peak. WHERE ARE THESE NUMBERS COMING FROM.
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:52:10
No need to exaggerate. A bank wouldn't take 50 dollars. Bitcoin fees are still too high for day-to-day use unless you use the lightning network
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:03:20


@_date: 2017-08-01 22:13:37
Coinbase is easy but charges high fees.

We're talking about investing potentially thousands of dollars based on an emotional response?
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:04:46
I have no doubt bitcoin will continue to grow long-term. In the short-term it's incredibly hard to predict which way it will move, but I will tell you that the market sentiment at the moment is that it will probably go up for the next few weeks... probably. 
If you are new to trading, Coinbase gives 10 euro of bitcoin free for referred investors. PM me if you'd like a referral. Don't use them long-term though because their fees are a bit high, try kraken or gemini. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:56:43
Personally, I find the number of coins arbitrary. Why does it matter?
What coins fit your criteria, just monero?
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:43:46
decimals and commas get swapped when writing numbers in English btw.

Bittrex tend to be pretty on the ball, however, BCH will plummet HARD and fast in my opinion. If you can't find an exchange for quick disposal of BCH, you will need a new strategy for putting your BCH to good use.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:00:37
half a million dollars...?
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:22:57
I bought at .115 thinking i was catching a nice dip. Missed the .13 because i wasn't looking... It was downhill from there, but I got out before things got much, much worse... I don't know how byteball went to shit so fast. It's quite insane.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:36:31
maybe pay your taxes instead.
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:55:06
Now this is how you make money with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:22:46
I would expect nothing less.

Whatever most people say is what you should say, I think. Definitely not like poodle. Personally I say like coddle, because that is the way it is spelt, and most people wouldn't know the root word at first before reading up on the source of the meme.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:06:11
I do big trades all the time with the same fee on bittrex. If the trade is good, the fee is worth it.

BTC is defacto store of wealth. It works as is.

@_date: 2017-11-10 12:54:48
The market is aware of your presence and has responded appropriately.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:36:18
are you buying on coinbase or something? Normal half-decent exchanges have low enough fees for you not to really need to worry about them. Hitbtc charges 0.1%, The Big One has no fees.

This is true. An exchange actually responding to a query is a red flag.

It already pulled back from 3k to 1.7k, so he's being moron.

Sweden is all about cashless payments now, but not crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:45:52
Supposedly cloakcoin wants to mimic monero, which almost assures anonymity if used over VPN. I personally think cloakcoin will be flawed because it's not even open source yet. An exploit will be found, the price will tumble.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:34:10
He says the transactions were almost instantaneous. Is this just an error on his part or can someone elaborate?

In fairness, I never had any plans to buy bitcoin. I never thought the SegWit thing would bring the price up this much this quickly. I'm more pissed that it dragged up the price of my favourite altcoin with it (and well, everything, as bitcoin does).
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:46:04
Yeah. The last guy who posted this fucking nailed their timing.

Supposedly it was due to an interview with whatshisname. The whole thing took place over almost exactly an hour. I didn't see the interview, but I'm assuming whatever show aired it was on for an hour?
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:01:38
Yeah, I don't get it either. Typical something would happen to panic everyone, yet no one speaks the language to find out what... I checked some asian exchanges and their prices didn't seem much different.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:46:46
i suppose they anticipate a wall of 3000 sellers so want to undercut them in case it never reaches 3000.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:56:54
