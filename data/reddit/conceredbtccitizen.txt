Thanks for the suggestion, upvote for you!
If I may ask, what makes they instant?  I'm on their site, and it says they do instant withdrawls to your checking via ACH, but I don't see how you deposit instantly?

This doesn't explain the HST attacks of  0.0010 that were occurring by the THOUSANDS.
Though it does explain how people are benefiting it, which gives the motive to actually perform these attacks.

Those are definitely attacks.  There were thousands and thousands of 0.001 BTC trades done between 1 to 5 per second.  There is no reason to do those other than to control the exchange process to induce a benefit.

WAIT WAIT that is a very valid point!
Employees/contactors/server-host-employees/etc can benefit HUGE by knowing, just a little bit in advance, when maint. is occurring, or when DDoS is just starting to hit, etc.

Fantastic write - and correct.  I'd say you're missing a very important piece of information...
...The community overall needs to be defensive.  The world will not openly embrace Bitcoin.  We are a threat to the central banking system of the world, as well as the US Fed, of which, both are likely the driving force behind a vast amount of world conflict.

You're going to have to explain that to me like a 5 year old :)

Ahh.  That part makes sense, but how does LocalTill or Bitfloor figure out it was you making the deposit?  Is there some sort of name/account number field to indicate who you are? 
Oh, and do you have to use Localtill and not just go directly to Bitfloor?

It's real easy.
Imagine your friend, John, was one of 10 kids selling fireworks in school.  Of all the 10 kids selling fireworks, they've found that 1 firework = 1 slice of Pizza, or a porno mag, as well as 1 firework = 1 day of a homework slave.
Now imagine suddenly if John had a friend named Frank who gave him a box of 10,000 fireworks.  John can now buy more Pizza, have more kids doing his homework, and overall, have a huge advantage over everybody else around him.
Now replace John with the Fed, and replace John's friend Frank with Big Banks.  
The Fed literally prints money, which dilutes the hard-earned cash of hundreds of millions of people, and just hands it to Big Banks for virtually 0 cost.  Big Banks then use that money to make a **FUCKTON** of money at no cost to themselves (as they got that money virtually free).
Big Banks then bribe the Fed and government overall to keep them status quo.  Actually, they bribe the fed to allow them to aggressively rape the wealth out of people at an ever-increasing rate.
Why?  Because the dollar exists.  The dollar has perceived value (eg, 1 hour of work for 20 dollars), and now the Fed/Big Bank shit on the general people's perceived value by printing it w/o any concern.
Bitcoin represents a change to central banking and a system of perceived value (eg, the dollar, eg, fiat).  Bitcoin creates a perceived value artifact that can be traded in a way which does not allow a third party to control it in the manner that is currently being done today which is literally crippling mankind.
Bank's can't get Bitcoin's printed for them and then use them at no cost to themselves to make trillions.  
Banks and Governments will fight this until their dying breath.  Why?  Because if Bitcoin succeeds, then the corrupt institutions that exist today will have then failed.  
Bitcoin or Fed/Big Banks.  Only one can be the victor.  Which will it be?
