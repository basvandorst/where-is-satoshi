I had an erroneous deposit of about 2k, it was removed like a week later. Sounds to me like you spent money you knew wasn't yours.

Possibilities: a) some blackhats are continuously attacking to drive down btc value to buy low and sell high b) state-sponsored attack to destroy btc confidence c) bored guy in a basement renting out botnets for the lulz.

It actually makes sense for the value of the dollar to increase. If you keep up with the news, you would know the Fed mouthpiece Jon Hilsenrath has a piece up on the WSJ (front page right now) stating the fed is prepared to taper its bond/MBS buying program.

Yeah, but that's just not going to fly. Why would businesses take the risk? Especially at these levels. Accepting bc at the wrong time could send em to bankruptcy.

This sub has been taken over by speculators. Mods should clean this place up, but they're probably speculators themselves.

Should not invest/bet with money you cannot afford to lose.

Already off the lows, hold. You'll laugh about it later.

I cannot believe I missed this, I first heard of bitcoin when I discovered silkroad. Fuck me! Anyway, How liquid is the market? Are you guys able to move in and out of positions quickly?
