I'm looking for cash. I bought it off coinbase, just never figured out how to sell.

I see. I'll check out Gemini, I bought them on coinbase, but it looks like I need to send them a picture of ID to sell which I'd rather not do.

I sent it via electrum and on the details it said there has been 1 confirmation

Well me and a guy that commented on here were talking and so we made the deal and I sent the bitcoin then nothing from him for like the last 15 minutes or so and he never sent the paypal so.

I put in 50$ when it hit 3500$ not even knowing it was low almost at 100$ now! (Lost a lot transferring to electrum from coinbase)

Been looking into bitcoin for a couple months now but didn't really know how to approach it, coinbase sounds like the best idea??

Im thinking of starting to buy bitcoin after researching about it for a while, how would I acquire hardware wallet? Or paper wallet? And how why is this recommended?

So i have moved my btc from coinbase to Electrum and it gave me my string of words, does that act as my private key?
