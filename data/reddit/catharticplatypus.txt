I bet they'll be really impressed when they find out that even you, the enthusiast, realize that bitcoin is such an unreliable and flaky payment system that you have to make test transactions with the recipient beforehand just in order not to get publicly humiliated when it doesn't work.

Oh wow, who could have thought that bitcoin shills are liars???

It's no good, if they have any sense in them they'll realize that bitcoin is even worse by the same metrics.

Doing anything useful with bitcoin without involving scores of middlemen is literally impossible. Luckily LN will solve all the problems of bitcoin by adding even more middlemen.

Yes, you don't understand what a pyramid scheme is.
Social security comes with no promises that you get more out than you put in, or even that you get the same sum out. If the active workforce shrinks in relation to the number of pensioners, either the pensions are cut or the taxes are increased until the system is in balance again.

Reviewing the code doesn't help much unless you're an expert in both cryptography and deceptive coding practices (practically nobody is). We've had plenty of examples of e.g. cryptographically weak random number generators leading to SFYL.

The reason you think social security is a pyramid scheme is because you don't understand how it works. Usually there is no "individual retirement account" where you save money for your own pension. Instead, it's a tax that the working population pays that is earmarked to pay the current pensioners, i.e. pay-as-you-go system. Pension funds exist mostly to act as buffers to even out demographic changes.

But that's not all! I think you'll also find that the Federal Reserve is a conspiracy designed to enslave the citizenry, mainstream economics is a scam perpetrated by 95% of the economics profession, and "computer security experts" who say bad things about bitcoin don't actually understand computers OR security.

To anyone not familiar with the technical jargon, this means losing all your bitcoins to a bug or a scam.

Wow, it's good to hear that r/bitcoin is finally free of technological illiteracy, rampant conspiracy theories and cargo cult science!

Hey devs, get off your asses and implement some new content. Just look at the three NPCs above my comment spouting the same old tired lines about NPCs, I've seen that shit hundreds of times already.

For some reason you left out
4\. He has had bitcoin explained to him by top experts in fintech, economics, distributed systems and cryptography, and their conclusion was that bitcoin just wasn't very good.

Sorry you're wrong, I see people accepting fiat money out of free will every single day so it must be super valuable, much more so than bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:27:14
So exactly like fiat money, except fiat has about a 1000 times more backers?

Just imagine the vitriol and death threats he would have to suffer once he puts out a video that points out how bitcoin is technologically woefully inefficient and economically a pyramid scheme. I think he'll pass.

Feel free to guess about the education level of  random internet strangers if it makes you happy. I'm just going to pettily point out that I was right:
