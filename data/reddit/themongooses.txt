That's why I'm trying to change all my BTC to Doge.
Come join us! It's pretty cool over here +5 doge
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:17:39
Haha yup - I have $0.05899USD left in there now.
It's only 5 cents but I still some how feel ripped off.

I'm over 7 days mate. Who the fuck knows what is going on with MtGox.
Best guest is gross incompetence.
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:54:33
48 hours - 0.5 BTC
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:20:15
72 Hours still going...
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:03:15
Yup - I know. I'm just curious who else is out there and how long they have been waiting. Just for interests sake.
I wanted to get my BTC out so I could buy doge cheap... but doge is going up now.

Withdrawals in bitcoin on MtGox are broken?!
@_date: 2014-01-29 07:27:32
It was bitcoin - going to a mobile wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:15:59
My transaction is lost too. Originally it was showing on  but now it has disappeared from that too...
My coins are nowhere?
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:00:28
Well this is even more concerning - It was in that list. But now it is not. It no longer shows and I still don't have the BTC....
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:08:24
I am - I have a few dollars left in my account with them that I want to change to BTC and bail.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:40:51
Thanks guys!
I withdrew from them a few days ago and it was only 30 mins - 1 hour.
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:54:07
Still waiting... 3days  0.5  Btc 
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:26:16
It has now been 21 hours and still no btc in my wallet! I'm getting worried. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:16:45
I refreshed the page (Crtl + R) 2-3 times and it started to work.
Let me know if this works for you too.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:40:08
There goes my bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:32:38
My transaction is on the list at:
But I don't understand the data or what this means. Are you able to help?
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:08:49
I am not - URL is correct and the SSL is correct.
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:24:57
I saw in a forum post that their support team is getting about 1700 tickets a day... I imaging you won't get a reply.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:10:32
Yup - It sure does. Did it work for you? If it did, I accept doge tips. :-P
