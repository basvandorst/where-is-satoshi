or their own version of "fedcoin" and get the government to outlaw the peoples version of bitcoin by making it illegal? Hope that is not their intent. I suspect central banks will not go down without a fight... should be interesting.

What if you lose the hardware wallet? Does it work the same as their app with 12 words recovery? I looked around the site and that aspect was not  obvious...

It does not matter "what" money is, it only matters who controls the "quantity" of money... I like bitcoin because there is a finite amount. I can trust that it won't be jacked by central banks and governments. Can they jack it in other ways? You bet... hang on for the ride I guess. diversify.

I have one of those too though I have not used it yet.

but are they grass finished too? Hopefully they are not feeding them any grain at all. Most grass feed then give grain at the end to fatten them up which defeats the purpose.

I only have a hard time trusting bitcoin while I am sleeping. I fear that it might go down in value or flash crash while I am out cold.

I'd still put a dollar or some small transaction in the wallet so it can be confirmed it's there after restore. Having a zero balance and restoring a zero balance would not give me a lot of confidence. That's just me.
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:05:29
one easy way is install electrum on another PC and put in your seed to restore. I bet logon to the same computer as another user would do the same as well.

its just a printed paper/pdf of your private key information. So if bitgo went out of business as an example, you can recover your coins and put them elsewhere. The coins only exist on the blockchain. The only thing a wallet does is manage the private key. The keycard is your private key info. it's an offline backup.
@_date: 2015-03-01 14:54:04
I use coinbase for all my buying and selling. Never once had an issue. I just don't store my coins there. I now only buy instant and immediately send my coins out. I recently switched to bitgo multisig. I also love mycellium for my mobile wallet and also endorse electrum. I've tried Armory but really hogged my CPU and took a long time to download the full chain. I also run a full node on bitcoin core but don't keep coins there. So far, bitgo.com is my favorite. When I send I need a separate send password plus my 2FA SMS code (authy) plus it alerts me to any account activity my sms and email and I can whitelist addresses so I can only send to certain addresses. I looked at greenaddess.it but went with bitgo because its USA based and I too live in USA. So currently I use bitgo for storage and mycellium for hot.

I keep a copy of my key card in a physical safe and also on the cloud encrypted. Plus, with all the layers of security bitgo adds... priceless.

@_date: 2015-03-02 11:46:53
With bitgo, you keep your keys. You can recover off line if they are gone. I like all the security around the process. 2 factor, multiple passwords and emails and text messages for anything that touches my account plus I can have a white list so I can only send to certain addresses. After everything I tried, I personally feel safe with their service. I'm paranoid.

Reading a summary does not help. That's not what Fat Head is about. The Fat Head documentary does analyze what was claimed by Spurlock but Spurlock gave no proof and refuses to release a food log. Fat Head goes deeper and only touches on Spurlock in the beginning. It goes deep info the Lipid Hypothisis, Carbs and healthy fats and science behind it along with personal choice. I enjoyed it. Well worth the 104 minutes of time I spent watching it. Though my intent was not to Hijack this thread that is seemingly about bitcoin,  I did however lose all respect for Spurlock and the premise of SuperSize me after watching Fat Head. For me, it's not something he could easily redeem from my point of view.
@_date: 2015-02-24 12:33:04
I do not disagree. This Bitcoin thing has legs to stand on and the excitement about other blockchain technologies is rather emotionally intoxicating. Just because my spellchecker does not know what "Bitcoin" is or "blockchain" won't slow me down one bit and just confirms we are early in this journey. Bring it!

I like coinbase. I buy from them and send to my other wallets. I don't keep my coin there. Linked to my bank account so I can buy and sell and have $1k instant a week if I like. Sure, some aspects make me a little paranoid but only in respect to keeping my coin there or on any exchange. If they make it easy for even my 70 year old parents to buy bitcoin and enter easily into the bitcoin economy without doing some back ally deal then it has served a purpose and is just one of many vessels to enter or exit the bitcoin economy.

I can't speak to their exchange other than their original exchange before their hyped exchange. I live in Pennsylvania and am patiently waiting. I can only hope that when a new state comes on, that state receives the same 3 month transaction free benefit. I have been using coinbase for quite some time but I got suckered with their exchange announcement. I bought 10 BTC before they announced at around @ $236. I had already maxed out my 1k weekly instant so there is a hold on the original 10 BTC I bought. When I went to bed the night before the official announcement the price at already bumped to $267. I went to bed. I woke up to check the price and it was over $300 so I believed the "to the moon" and immediately bought 10 more BTC but again, there is like a 4-5 day hold but the transaction is at this point final. The price went up a few more dollars then crashed like crazy. I had no way to sell because my BTC would not arrive until the Friday after the announcement so all week I watched my $$$ do a magic trick and disappear. I am still buying at this level and will continue but I am a little salty I fell for the moon and the excitement that turned out to be rubbish anyway with the whole "legal gray area" of CA and NY. So anyway. It is what it is I guess. I am still a believer. I do like the ease of coinbase service. For me I do not hold my coins there. I buy and instantly send to my cold storage bip38 paper wallets. I keep some on my phone with mycelium as my hot wallet. Anyway, I can't wait for the exchange to reach Pennsylvania "legality" but who knows what else will pop up by then...

OK. So I watched the living on Bitcoin for a week today after I saw it posted on youtube. I will say it was fair. My bias against Spurlock was not unfounded based on a previous experience with both Super Size Me and Fat Head documentaries. I really did not think this guy would come at Bitcoin with a good angle at all since most of the media is not keen to be super supportive and tends to reports only the dark sides of Bitcoin in their attempts to shape public opinion and support a narrative that supports central control everything via federal government. So I was wrong. He did a nice job and my opinion is now more favorable towards Spurlock's objectivity in documenting without pushing a bias for the sole purpose of pushing some liberal agenda. I can't speak for his other work but this Bitcoin piece was done well and was a fair representation of Bitcoin and it's potential and was fair both pro and con when representing what Bitcoin is and can be.

financial tracking software like YNAB or quicken etc that have BTC price tracking built in to as I manage my spending in USD I know how much I have left at any time or so I can adjust my budget based on current price etc. I want to be able to have a BTC account in my financial software that i just keep the amount of BTC I have and it shows the current valuation in USD etc.

I am a coinbase customer and I would like to use your vault feature for the very reasons you mentioned above but if I want to panic sell I can't because of the 48 hour waiting period. I generally buy from coinbase and then send to my mycelium,paper or electrum wallets and because of paranoia move the money between wallets and change passwords often. Either way, I love the service coinbase provides and has made it easy for me to buy and sell bitcoin (though I really hope Pennsylvania will be a USD wallet soon). I also like when the guy a couple weeks ago fell to email phishing scam and you guys gave him his coins back when it was his totally his fault. I have no issues and will continue to support you guys privately and publicly. I am just paranoid about say an overzealous government shutting you down while I am sleeping and wake up not able to get my bits moved out. After seeing many governments leery and threatened about bitcoin, I just feel better with my private keys though. I am interested in the vault feature but the 48 hour thing always seems to get into my head and keeps me from pulling the trigger. I did set up a coinbase multisig but for now I will wait and see.
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:12:55
ouch. Sorry to hear that. I use mine a lot but haven't yet bought more than 3k at a time. no issues so far.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:12:21
Yes, though me if they so desire. They also have a family budget allocation. So if they give me the bitcoin, I set an dollar allocation so they can spend it on the house account. They each have a line item. I use a software called YNAB to assist. Works out pretty well.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:22:54
Dude, the OP said is was a "Gem" and "Best perspective on Bitcoin I've ever heard."  I kept waiting for the good part and it never came. The title of this thread over sold and under delivered. I got skunked.

Yes, and the public ledger to follow the money... easy arrest right? I wonder if the criminals realize when they go to sell it it's not so anonymous? I guess they could sell it for cash to some unsuspecting buyer. Either way, its not so easy to shake the chain...
