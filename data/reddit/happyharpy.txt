Poor my husband made bitcoin fascinating and I have it and Dogecoin wallets! I think it's all cool. 
Wasn't there a thread where non bitcoin tipping was cool? I got some tips yesterday and want to spread them around.
Ninja edit to spell bitcoin right ;)

This is pretty much right on!

Thanks. I'm new to altcoins... just setting up a tipjar for my art site, so I'm subscribed here.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:18:35
Thanks! I'll spread it around!

I would love a tip of 500 bits. It's the thought that counts. Just my 2 cents.

Our company is working on an eCommerce site and they want to build in Bitcoin as a payment option!

Working on integrating bitcoin to my art site… got a tip jar set up that's working with a QR code, but still need to incorporate it into the eCommerce section.

I love this phrase!
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:21:47
This is awesome!
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:25:10
Darn... I knew that! The altcoins are the forks!
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:23:39
My exact thoughts. I "design" sites, but I work with a programmer! 
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:17:42
OK I will! I'll have to find that post that listed the tip-friendly subs!
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:37:01
Thanks, I will!
ETA Thank you!
