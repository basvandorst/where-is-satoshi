This is why I love mining! Guaranteed income 24 hours a day.

Yes, I sent a segwit BTC transaction before... cost only $8.50 for a confirmation time of 20 minutes. That's not bad.

The mining crackdown is a recent event. With the China ban though, initially there were a lot of rumors, hence why it was called FUD. This turned out to be true, yet the effect on the price was short lived and cryptocurrencies have thrived since.

Who cares about NEM? Anyway that hack accounted for only ~0.1% of the total market cap. On top of that, the wallet the funds were transferred to has been blacklisted (a quality of NEM it seems) so the funds cannot be spent. Comparing to Mt Gox, the most valuable (bitcoin) coin was stolen, and the amount was equal to ~half the total market cap at the time. This hack means nothing.

How do you get it? I can't find anything in the galaxy store.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:19:34
It must not be available in my region :(

Just whales playing their games. Check out the 1 minute candles. Both dips today happened due to a huge amount of BTC being dumped in a 1 minute interval. Doesn't look organic to me. It looks like someone is trying to force a bear market. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:39:36
How did you calculate that probability? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:39:53
I don't use coinbase... I use BTC Markets (aussie).

So all the 'people' just happened to get nervous and cash out on every exchange all within 30 seconds of each other, with a volume increase of 10x in that 30 second interval? Come on...

This was sent from an exchange so unfortunately I had no control over the fee or whether the address used segwit :(
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:45:37
Usually 1 exchange will lead the charge, and it is usually Bitfinex, GDAX or Bitthumb (although Bitthumb often has its own independent movements).

Wouldn't surprise me. The wall street types would gladly watch the world burn if it meant making a profit.

Tried to send 1 BTC to Binance yesterday, 24 hours ago, still not a single confirmation...
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:22:27
When exactly is the hard fork happening? Is there a countdown? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:34:47
Hmm yes I would expect such events to raise some flags and for the account to be automatically frozen until the situation can be investigated properly. You should be using authentication though. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:21:18
Don't forget to take profits.
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:28:35
Consider this... the market just saw a 60-80% correction/crash. If Tether really was a scam, do you think they would have been able to handle that many people cashing out? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 07:35:40
Is there any new information? This has been known since 2011. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:22:53
Do you remember the 1 second flash crash from 10.5k to 9.5k the other week caused by someone market selling 3000 BTC? If 3000 BTC can do this, imagine what 6000 to 18000 can do. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:38:40
I do use segwit. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:21:42
What are they doing that is sketchy? I don't see any evidence backing up any of these crack pot conspiracy theories. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:18:25
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:37:32
At least.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:46:04
Hold until it becomes the standard currency used world wide, then you won't need to sell!
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:06:36
Should I be fine to just leave my BTC in my electrum wallet and wait?
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:56:40
BTC will be $50k by 2020 most likely. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:10:54
If BCC is going to have any value, it is going to be at the cost of BTC value unless more $$$ floods into the market. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:15:42
Isn't BTC itself getting segwit without needing to fork good news? Who cares about some hard fork when the real BTC has segwit? Why would there be any real support for BCC? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:09:15
Why? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:07:42
Did you ever get confirmation on the specific reason for the bans? This seems ridiculous.
