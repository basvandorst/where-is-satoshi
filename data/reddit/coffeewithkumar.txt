Yes, I understand that. But, even on P2P the sellers are not decreasing the rates? When bitcoin falls, there must be some sellers who decrease the rates.
 Just like stock market, people sell at lower rates when the stock goes down. But, in this case, the fluctuation is very low, in front of thousand dollar fall, there is just 10,000 rupees of decrease in the price. How is that possible?
I think the exchanges are buying these currencies from int. exchanges and selling them on higher rates to their users. They are creating a monopoly because they know that Indian investors have to buy the coins anyway.

Making bank account outside India without any residence proof of that country? Is that even possible? I am not aware of that till date. And, even if I do open an account, the US exchanges may ask for KYC documents to load USD in the account.
I may be wrong, but that's what I know. ��

I will try to find out, if that is possible then there is nothing wrong in giving it a shot. ;)

Well, for Arbitrage trading one have to find a way to buy coins out of India. It is extremely difficult, I haven't found a way till now. 
Although, you are right. Either traders or exchange owners, they all are doing arbitrage trading and making good money out of it. In other worlds, they are taking full advantage of the situation. ��

Because I don't know about a safer way to buy from US exchanges.

Yes, you are right, it is making lower highs and lower lows but this fall is looking quite serious because it happened within minutes and it is showing difficulty even around 6500 now. I hope it stabilises around this level.   
The major support is at 6000 (as per many experts and the chart). If it cracks that support, then it will be a problem.

 - Thanks for understanding. I was trying to mention this free fall to the investors in this community. May be someone is planning to invested or may be invested a couple of days back. He/she needs to know about this kind of fall as soon as possible so that they can attend accordingly.

If someone purchases a stock/ETF then it will stay in Abra app or we can transfer it to some other account as well?

They don't understand that this kind of ban is not going to stop mining in any way. Such a shame.

The fee structure is good, but the website is very new and I am not able to find much reviews on social sites. Have you tried this site for buying or selling?
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:17:58
Thanks for the reply. Is that a reliable exchange? Have you tried it before?
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:22:57
Yes, they do accept skrill �� 
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:41:56
I think they do not support skrill. Just checked supported payment methods, skrill is not there in the list ��

Have you tried it before?
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:26:48
Thanks for the details ��

Ok, I will try to deal with reliable sellers only. But, in case of dispute, does the exchange provides some kind of help or its just on us?
