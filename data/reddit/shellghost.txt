Whilst there are entities that have a huge proportion of total bitcoin in their wallets you will not see any government adoption as a currency. I worry that the fact that some of these wallets are lost means that the risk will always be too high.

I can honestly say I had not seen your comment before now. It's quite an obvious counter to the deflationary argument, perhaps I thought I was being more clever than I am.

Hi Andreas, I enjoy all of your talks immensely, this one in particular was the reason I initially became interested in bitcoin. Rock on!

Max Keiser needs to know that he has been ostracized from the Bitcoin community.

Most of your points have been answered a thousand times. But you do raise some genuine, well known, issues. Firstly environmental waste, not being anonymous and consumer protection. The latter two I believe will be solved in time. I also agree with the transaction time being too long, to an extent, it is not immediately clear to a n00b that 1 confirmation is good enough.
The power usage of the mining network is perhaps the only issue I believe will not be solved over time and with greater adoption.

They don't put the title in the url. This kills the SEO.

Out of interest what order of magnitude are you invested, I have about one months wage in BTC and am not certainly not losing sleep.

How do I create an analogue paper wallet without using a third party? Can I just 'think up' a private and public key?

I had similar concerns when getting confirmed at bittylicious, I emailed them and they said they encrypt the images with a private key not stored on the server. For bitstamp I would email them with your concerns.

I disagree, those will be solved with greater adoption. Environmental waste of mining will only become larger.

Not entirely true, I used to develop games in my spare time and albeit very rarely brand new builds would set off certain antivirus software.
