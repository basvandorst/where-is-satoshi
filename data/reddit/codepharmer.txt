Isn't this exactly why Bitcoin wasn't made Turing complete?

Henry: Hello there! How can I help you today?
→Hi, I made a purchase order for bitcoin on the 11th
→my bank account was charged on the 11th
→the BTC was supposed to arrive 5 days later
→on the day that coin was supposed to arrive, the order was cancelled
→I received this e-mail
→On June 11, 2016, your purchase 0.33784314 BTC via bank transfer for $200.00 USD. Unfortunately, we’ve cancelled your purchase. We know you were looking forward to receiving your order, and we’re sorry to disappoint. If you were charged, you will receive a full refund to your bank account within 3-4 business days. We don’t like having to cancel an order. However, due to the nature of bitcoin transactions, our system occasionally needs to prioritize security over order delivery. Unfortunately, there are times when our processes don’t lead to the right decision, and end up cancelling a good customer’s order. If you think we’ve made a mistake, we sincerely apologize. Here’s what you can do to help prevent future purchases from being cancelled.
→I had verified my account in the past for instant purchases, and even received an e-mail from coinbase on april 6 stating that my limits have increased
Henry: I have notified our subject experts who will review your account within the next 2 business days. If you are unable to create a new purchase after this period, unfortunately you will be ineligible to use the Coinbase platform to purchase Bitcoin. We're sorry for any inconvenience that this may cause. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we complete this review. Have a nice day!
→I'm not finished
→I want to know why the order was cancelled
→I want to know why it wasn't cancelled before withdrawing funds from my account
→and why it will take an additional 4 days for those funds to be returned
→based on what you're saying the only way to verify that my account will work is to make ANOTHER purchase and hope that it goes through?

When I first joined Coinbase everything worked perfectly and they earned my brand loyalty. The progressive deterioration happened so slowly that I just hadn't reached a tipping point until now. What is the P2P exchange you are referencing?

If it were I would think you would see far fewer class action suits.

I only see the coinbase transactions from my bank account, they don't show on coinbase.

I agree it is most likely a hack on the bank side, but what is strange to me are these "Sent BTC to Coinbase: Bought 1.0 BTC @ $400" that add -0.003579 to my account
@_date: 2015-11-21 02:44:14
how can I get in contact with a real human being?

I resolved the issue with coinbase, my complaint is that at no point did they indicate to me that money was owed or my balance was negative.
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:47:51
I am experiencing the same issue.
@_date: 2015-11-21 03:22:24
unfortunately they restrict submissions to @_date: 2015-11-25 18:31:57
It's also coinbase's responsibility to display an accurate wallet balance, and that should include negative numbers. Even coinbase support agreed this was a terrible experience and they are *working on improving it*

I had to close the account but it is still overdrawn. I also reported the transactions as fraud.

I never had a negative balance of Bitcoin. Coinbase uses Bitcoin, but it isn't Bitcoin. It is a trusted 3rd party that manages your private keys. Their internal accounting system has every ability to indicate a negative balance or owed funds.
