So as I understand how the lightning network works, in order for a program to accept or send payments for you it needs to have the private keys to particular lightning transactions on-hand so that they can be exchanged when you make a new lightning transaction and to sign in the case of the other party breaking the rules, which seems like a little bit of a security risk (Best practice, of course, is to not keep plain-text private keys to active addresses on any online computer). Authorizing the necessary signs and broadcasts by hand on an air-gapped, clean install computer would be a bit of a pain as compared with letting a program do it on a connected computer, especially for a merchant taking a lot of orders through their channel(s), or an exchange...
Of course it will *probably* never be *fully* safe doing it entirely automatically (anything can be hacked, and of course recently we're seen the Spectre and Meltdown issues...), so are there any plans to implement a hardware wallet designed with the lightning network in mind (or a lightning wallet that allows offline signing by generating the private key on an existing hardware wallet design) where you could, for example, just press the button to authorize for the key exchange part of the protocol or whatever at every transaction?

If someone claims to have sent you the Bitcoin by mistake, if they are requesting it to be sent to a different address you should demand that they sign a message that you decide upon with the private key to the original address, and check that it verifies to the sending address. Most wallets will make this process relatively easy.
Have you ever shared the address with anyone? Who would know the address?
If you made any withdrawals to that address from an exchange you can try contacting them (But of course get them to sign a message for proof).

You buy something and the shopkeeper foolishly doesn't wait for confirmation(s) or check the fee compared to the others in the mempool. They see on their node that it gets kicked from the mempool and they re-broadcast in the hope that it gets included in a block before you spend that output.
Or how about this: You broadcast a transaction that has a fee too low. Two weeks or whenever later it gets kicked from the mempool and you decide not to send it again with a higher fee.
Then maybe a few months later the mempool clears a bit and a miner, seeing that it now has a fee per weight higher than everything else being sent and that particular UTXO is still there decides to attempt to include it in a block.

Here is one way to do it:
* 1: Install gpg4win or a similar utility (other steps assume gpg4win). There's a problem here that really, to be REALLY safe we need to verify the integrity of *that* file, and so on and so on. Only way you can *really* be sure is looking through every line in the source code of bitcoin core for anything suspicious and compile it yourself (by hand in a hex editor because theoretically we can't trust the compiler, but on the other hand we can't really trust the OS or even the hardware either *really*).
* 2: From the command line, run *gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0x90C8019E36C2E964* (Note that this might change in the future, as this is the signing key of one person on the project). Again, it's probably best practice to check this against other sources, just in case one person or group compromised pgp.mit.edu and bitcoin.org at the same time. If the pgp.mit.edu server is down, use another one (and really you should check lots of key servers anyway). ALSO. Note that the line that I just wrote down might be edited later by a reddit admin for example, or I myself could theoretically be a malicious agent or my reddit account hacked. Don't take my word for it, search around that that really is what you ought to put in. Best practice is using web of trust correctly (finding a trusted person that can verify the key, or knows someone that can verify the key and so on), however this can be impractical for most people.
* 3: Download the SHA256SUMS.asc file (For example, from  or  if you are using that version), navigate to it's file location in the command line and run *gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc*. 
You can look at the fingerprint and compare it to the one on this page :  (and compare that to a few other sources such as  or  Really, type in "pgp key servers" into google and search a whole bunch of them). If it does not say "good signature" in the command line you have a problem. 
* 4: Assuming that the signing key from step 2 was not faked in some way by the same people that have theoretically compromised bitcoin.org, github etc (or compromised your access to them by man-in-the-middling) we can now trust that the SHA256SUMS.asc was at least signed by the private key of the lead maintainer of the bitcoin core project. This file will have a list of bitcoin core software variants (for example, windows 32 bit, windows 64 bit, portable etc) and their associated hashes, that you can look at by opening it in a text editor. 
* 5: In the command line and in the correct directory, type in *certUtil -hashfile [Bitcoin Core File Name Here] sha256*. Make sure that what shows up on the screen is the same as what is in the SHA256SUMS.asc file. If it does not match exactly as what is on the appropriate line in the SHA256SUMS.asc file, you have a problem and you should not install.
In order to *truly* make sure that the key that you're getting really is the legitimate one you would pretty much have to meet them in person, or someone else that was trusted that signed their key that knew them in person... But for most people with not a lot of bitcoin just looking around online in several places and making sure all the sources corroborate is *probably* fine, much like it's *probably* fine for most people with not a lot of bitcoin to leave bitcoin in a hot wallet. You, and only you can decide on your acceptable risk profile with regards to verification of bitcoin core, keeping in mind that hackers abound.

Technically it is possible for someone to continuously re-broadcast the transaction, no?

The merkle tree calculation part of it might increase with more transactions in the block, but that is in a sense "computational overhead"; for every block that part only has to be found *once per block* regardless of how many nonces you try.

A miner can mine a block with whatever rules they like. But if they try to sell the "bitcoins" resulting from that whatever exchange they use will ignore them because their full node being run will reject that block.
Same goes for shopkeepers accepting bitcoin and anything like that; far harder to trick them if they have a full node.
You wouldn't accept payment for a house in bitcoin or other very high value transaction if you didn't check through your own full node.
Whenever the miner who changed the rules would try and use their "bitcoin" no-one would accept them if they are running full nodes. The miner will not be able to do any economic activity with the reward from the block they mined.
Mining centralization IS a serious problem in bitcoin right now of course, but if most exchanges and so on are running their own nodes (And if you are running a bitcoin exchange it would be insanity to not have your own full node; that's like a bank not having any mechanism for checking counterfeit notes) the damage a big miner can do is limited.

Yes, github servers store the code on github (And it does other things, like makes issue tracking etc easier), but it's possible to use the Git Distributed Version Control System without using github or gitlab, BitBucket etc.
Perhaps I shouldn't have implied that git is a distributed p2p code repository; github *is* the code repository, but you *can* do things in a peer-to-peer (or more accurately friend-to-friend) way just with git, and there's projects like GitTorrent to torrent code repositories that use Git.
Every developer working on a project using git is a peer from which other people can download the project from (if it's set up correctly), and has their own copy of the code. You can set up a git server for a particular repository on your home computer and allow other people to download it (If they know your IP address etc).
You can fetch code from another developer working on a project by adding their computer as a remote server to get the branches they are working on.
There was a "gitchain" project to basically "blockchain git" where everyone stores the git data of everyone else rather than just whatever they're interested in, but I don't think it's seeing much use/went very far.

Be fair now, *all* on-chain transactions are *also* unrecoverable in the event of data loss (meaning private key backups lost).
It's a different security model than an on-chain transaction, sure (The interactivity means that you must do it online and it must be a hot wallet). But that doesn't make the transaction itself *not secured*, just that potentially the use of it is less secure than other ways of using bitcoin.
I buy that it's an additional layer of complexity on top of bitcoin and therefore inherently less trustworthy, but this factor will be reduced as more people use it, the implementations get more eyes looking over them and so on as time progresses.

CashApp knows a collection of cryptographic secret keys that map to bitcoin addresses associated with unspent transaction outputs (UTXO). They also have a database where they keep track of which accounts have how much bitcoin, with the total hopefully matching to the total UTXO set value that is theirs.
What you want to be doing is moving your bitcoin to addresses where you, **and only you**, know the associated private key(s).
 When you search for these addresses in any blockchain explorer (or ideally on your node implementation) it would then show an active balance, and you are able to sign arbitrary messages with the private key that verify to those addresses.


You have a claim on them, but only in a technical legal sense that will do you absolutely no good if bad things happen.
Consider what happens if Square goes bankrupt tomorrow. The bitcoin that was never really in your *actual possession* is now, most likely, just a sinking feeling in your stomach. Possession is **ten** tenths of the law as far as the Bitcoin protocol is concerned.
On the other hand, say you are using Electrum (As an example) and for whatever reason the software suddenly will never work again on any computer. You can simply import the key backup (*You did securely backup the keys, right?*) to another program and continue on, because knowledge of the key and not the program itself is what matters.
This comes with some risks too of course - you must take responsibility for the bitcoin. If you install the wrong software or you get other malware or otherwise do something dumb none of us can help you. But the general consensus is that controlling the keys is much better than the alternative.
If you're paranoid and buying a lot, hardware wallets that manage the keys and that are designed to do signing operations in a secure environment are a potentially good idea. Otherwise you can setup something like that with an old laptop or similar.
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:32:19
You can generate the address from the private key, but not the other way around.

Look, I don't disagree with you there. Some economists even say that usefulness is actaully a *detrimental* property for a currency because if you're using it in some use-case or other that isn't a currency then it's not circulating through the economy, and therefore the best currencies are otherwise basically useless. 
My comment was more with you saying "You can't use the gold for anything" - You can use it in electronics, anywhere you need corrosion resistance, as a catalyst in some chemical reactions, etc etc. You didn't qualify your statement.
Technically Bitcoin is the same way as you say - you can use it for data storage. If humanity somehow simultaneously lost all interest in the speculative/wealth storage aspect of gold some people would still buy it because they need it for something, and with the price so low, considering it's properties there are plenty of use-cases where gold would be a good material to use but it isn't because it doesn't make sense in our world because of the cost.
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:12:35
Bitcoin transactions *never* really *clear*, as in it is *guaranteed* that you really have it.
They clear in a *probabilistic* way - every new block that is mined after the one that includes your transaction reduces the probability estimate that your transaction will be undone, with a single block being good enough for most transactions and further blocks on top of that rapidly improving confidence in the transaction to &gt;99.9999% in relatively short order, without someone spending a truly enormous and ever-increasing amount of money (as more blocks get mined) to undo it. 
You also have to trust that the mathematical/cryptographic assumptions that the bitcoin protocol makes are valid - if that gets broken then all of that evaporates. I think you're relatively safe on that front though.
If it was a high-value transaction, recommendation is to wait for maybe 6 blocks to be certain, but use your own judgement; there's a calculator somewhere on the internet that will tell you the cost to undo n-blocks. Exchanges, coinbase etc will usually credit you after a certain number of confirmations (mined blocks), e.g. 1 or 2, with zero-confirmations (not-yet mined) will usually show up as a "pending" transaction or similar.
Also obligatory PSA - you didn't really receive bitcoin, coinbase did and credited it to your account. If it isn't your (and only your) private key that controls the address it's more like an IOU than actual bitcoin - think the analogy of a gold certificate compared to actual gold. Just like a gold certificate has counterparty risk and is never as good as actual gold you are physically holding in some emergency that affects the issuer of the gold certificate, bitcoin credited to an account you have with an exchange or custodial wallet service is not as certain as bitcoin you ACTUALLY hold.
Of course, setting up secure bitcoin storage yourself takes some forethought and it's not something that everyone gets right. Just be aware that it's a risk either way (though of course you must consider that coinbase is probably a bigger target than you are to thieves); perhaps coinbase goes belly-up tomorrow or some employee runs with all the bitcoin to a tropical island somewhere, and on the other hand perhaps you make a mistake setting up a secure *actual* (as opposed to custodial) bitcoin wallet and a hacker takes it (from a hot wallet) or your neighbor is running a Van Eck Phreaking device that steals your private keys from the screen, or whatever other disaster scenario you imagine.
I personally prefer to be self-reliant in security matters here, not trusting third-parties with cryptocurrency long-term. Hacks (or "hacks" as the case may be) of exchanges happen all the time. If you go down that path make sure you, for example, verify ALL the PGP signatures and hashes of software and are generally very careful with how you handle the private keys and backing them up securely (for example, encrypted in a way you are *certain* you will know how to decrypt, even a decade from now, and in a few different mediums in safe places).
Just be careful you don't lose control of the bitcoin - you're on your own (plus people on reddit, youtube etc giving advice, I guess...though of course, unlike a bank's support for example we **can't** cancel or reverse transactions you didn't mean to make or didn't authorize and we **can't** retrieve the funds if you lose the private key, and neither can we really help you if coinbase somehow cheats you or disappears).
That's all assuming that you're not planning on instantly selling, in which case you don't really need to hold bitcoin yourself, no.
edit: Looking at what you've said, 


So it sounds like what happened here is that no actual bitcoin *moved*, just the numbers in coinbase's database. In which case there's probably no actual bitcoin transaction here, so the thing about number of block confirmations can be ignored in this case (not if you were receiving bitcoin from a source outside coinbase though; also i'm not sure if coinbase has any charge-back procedure in that case; where none of the bitcoin they're holding moved outside and no actual protocol-level transaction occurred. Don't think so, though.).

You can use gold for plenty of industrial, scientific and medical purposes. It would still have "use-value" even if it was literally cheaper than dirt, because it is useful for those things and would find therefore find use in those use-cases.
It's denser than lead so if it was common you would even see it used in various applications to do with that - ballast etc.

The main benefit of SegWit is that it is a malleability bug fix - without it there was a flaw in the protocol whereby transaction identifiers could be changed in-transit prior to being mined, which can be a huge problem for anyone tracking incoming/outgoing transactions, or for people that want to accept bitcoin from an unconfirmed (not yet mined) transaction output.
Prior to the SegWit roll-out, blocks could be 1 megabyte in size. Now blocks have a *weight limit*. The size-to-weight ratio of transactions is variable (also, a person would have to basically design an optimized block in order to get anywhere close to 4 megabytes); there is no way, for example, to fit a higher number of pay-to-pup-key-hash transactions that you could previously. So it is not as simple as just a block size increase. If everyone kept using the pay-to-pub-key-hash transaction protocol there is no effective block size increase and blocks would have to keep being 1 megabyte.
The reason for this is that SegWit was implemented in a way that older implementations see the transactions as "pay-to-anyone", while newer implementations see the transaction and know that the signature proving the right to spend funds is formatted in a different way to how it was done previously. 


Lightning protocol is extendable to n-parties, not just two. Would not be particularly useful otherwise.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:53:31
You should obviously be using unique addresses for orders.
Unless you want to do something like present customers with a message and ask them to sign it with the private key of the sending address, how are you going to know which customer has paid for which one if it all goes to the same address? Although on second thought you totally could ask the customer to sign a message to prove they sent the transaction.
I'm not really sure what you mean by an address changing... addresses shouldn't change. You can stop using an address (for example when you send from it) but the address should still be valid (though there are implications to address re-use).
