it's not, just remove the garbage from url like this: 
actually, the quoted text is a full copy of that paste

but is it a frappucino?

@_date: 2014-01-24 18:02:37
you can use gyft and buy from amazon, too.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:24:32
you can use the mini private key format, it's a lot shorter
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:47:51
lol :D
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:30:41
indeed 
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:34:36
BTW, you can also do something about the months old pull requests for the Android wallet app
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:10:54
Why there's no XBT ticker at the top? :D
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:58:03
IIRC the price will be adjusted when they finally start shipping the preorders.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:21:14
nope, no hardware changes - you just need to "jailbreak" it
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:03:12
all exchanges support this. you just put up a buy order for whatever price you like and then wait...
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:41:26
It would take only 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584 seconds or 269283928458874873078072058159739320588999964 times the age of our universe (assuming you don't find any hash collisions).
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:39:22
the diff would increase 4x, as that's the maximum amount by which it can increase in a single retarget (or go down 4x).
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:42:54
i already got one!
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:51:43
* there's 2^256 possible combinations for a sha256 hash
* 256 / 8 = 32 bytes, not characters (1 byte is represented by two characters in hexadecimal)
* the only allowed hexadecimal characters are 0-9 and a-f, so 16 in total
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:07:40
nah, they're lower than on some chinese exchanges
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:57:28
for the extra paranoid:
  &gt; as you'll already have the key and address generated, it would be much safer to use a completely bitcoin-unrelated software, preferably open-source, eg. (assuming windows user) this one 
  &gt; also, make sure you do it on an offline pc and reconnect only after rebooting.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:37:09
The procedure might be a little different, but I'm pretty sure it can be done. You can search the forums at  for the jailbreak and other instructions (eg. the screensaver hack for putting images into the user store).
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:14:15


did you mean "online banking as safe as a wallet"? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:35:47
what he meant is that this transaction might have been a deposit to mtgox, and that those 25k coins were sold then
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:43:13
or simply encrypt the private key with a passphrase - we have a BIP for that 
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:08:54
should've waited a bit and posted this in "moronic monday" thread lol
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:05:43
I see you've made an Android section. You can add Orbot, Orweb and Gibberbot. Also, Cryptonite is a nice app for encrypting files on the phone. DroidWall to selectively block internet access for every single app (root required).
