If everybody thinks 2022 is the moon, it won't be. Set it like 2027 is better.

Hi, my name is Roger Ver, long time Bcash advocate and Buttpay investor.
Today I'm at the Butt world headquarters in San Pedo, California.
I had a nice chat with Stephen pair, the ceo, about their current situation.
He showed me multiple racks of servers, backdoors, side doors and a lawyer team.
I'm sure that all the current fraud warning problems at Buttpay are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of security of the company. Shall any bcash is stolen from you account, restassure it will be absorbed by the company SAFU
