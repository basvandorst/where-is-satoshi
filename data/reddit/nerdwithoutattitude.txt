Thanks you.   
I now have a trezor wallet and made an anonymous investment on a BTC ATM.  
May i ask another questions?  
I had to pay 4,5% fee at the BTC ATM. This is ok for me concerning anonymity but it is too much when i want to invest some money.  
1) Where can i buy BTC for less fees?  
2) And when i pay BTCs by paypal or creditcard (not anonymous), can i open a 2nd wallet on my trezor that cannot be connected with my 1st account (anonymous BTCs)?

That sounds perfect!
Will buy a ledger nano s today and then have to learn how this works and which apps/software are compatible.
Thanks for your advice.
I think I will be back here soon...

Thank you.   
I read this but at this point it becomes harder the more i read...  
;)  
So i just need answers for those 3 questions and then i will start with bitcoins...

I think i really only need "a little bit of privacy".  
I am not a journalist, politicians, terrorist or criminal.
I just started to be more private and i am a little bit angry how i was the time before that change, so with bitcoins i wanted  to do it better from the start.
That should not be so hard?
