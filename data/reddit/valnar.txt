I didn't really know about side chains before, so i did a quick look up, but there seems to be a few issues that I see off hand, unless I'm missing something.
Inflation: if you had 1 chain, and then introduce a sidechain that for the sake of simplicity is a copy of the first chain. Essentially same code on two chains. Wouldn't the rate of coins entering essentially double?
Exchange rate: let's now assume that there is significant code differences between the two chains. what exactly would be the exchange rate between the two? It seems like it would have to be 1:1 among immobilized coins, otherwise there would seemingly be coins destroyed or created from nothing. But the coins wouldn't necessarily have the same value because they might have different usefulness.
Security: what happens if someone takes over a side chain? Would they be able to exert control over other chains?

How often in your day to day life do you actually use bitcoin as a currency?

So, won't this cause a pretty substantial drop in the BTC price at the fork?

There could be a fork though that overtakes original Bitcoin and includes a change to the total number of coins.

The problem with this mentality is that even if you buy the coffee with cash, your still losing out on the same amount of money, because you could have spent that cash on bitcoin. 
The only correct move according to your line of reasoning is to not buy the coffee at all, but buy btc instead.

Are people actually using bitcoins for those uses you listed in a significant capacity?

another element that makes it feel like a ponzi scheme is the rate at which coins come out.
as time goes on the rate of coins coming out lowers, meaning that people who got in earlier get disproportionately way more out of it than later adopters.

Big changes would have to be though forks right?
Couldn't that cause both confusion over which fork is the 'real' bitcoin, and some odd inflation like issues as the values of coins in forks might both have value?

How exactly can btc become a standard form of currency?
Bitcoin, as far as I can see, will 100% need to do forks in the future just so that it can keep updated with the times and be maintained.
However because of its decentralized nature, there won't necessarily be an "official" Bitcoin, rather different versions of Bitcoin with varying dominance.
The US government can make updates to the USD (for example counterfeit protections) without declaring it a completely different currency, because it is centralized.

The term was created to describe stuff like "Hillary Clinton has Barrels of Dead Bodies in her Back Yard".
Stuff that literally had zero basis in reality.
The term got co-opted by Trump and people on the right to describe anything that wasn't kind to Trump/the right.

Hmm ok, I guess that would be something more to look into.
From a technical perspective it kinda seems like it could get messy having multiple side chains of different versions and then possibly down the line a fork might be needed in the main chain. But maybe there is something for that too.

Something smells really wrong with this line of events.
Where exactly is this value coming from?
According to you, the split is creating 22% of btc's total value in this situation, from what? How will both bt1 and bt2 be able to hold value enough to sell like that and actually get that value?

I wasn't talking about a chain that starts with more than 0 coins, I was talking about coins being generated by miners in that new sidechain after its started. I've done a bit more reading on it since I made that previous post though, and I guess there just isn't supposed to be a coin reward in side chains?
If thats the case how do you get miners to run in a side chain? Transaction fees? That seems kinda risky and seems like would only work if the side chain is really active/has a really high fee.


But the main chain will always be running old code right? The guy who I was originally responding to said that this was an option to upgrade bitcoin instead of forking. Wouldn't that overall have at least some weird effect on the price of bitcoin if its always limited by the original version?


But everyone who had coins on that chain would likely be fucked or atleast at a high risk of being fucked right? That'd have consequences for the entire system.
Again, if sidechains were a way to update the code of bitcoin then wouldn't that be an issue if someone gets control of it?
Wouldn't it also at least somewhat put the main chain in danger, because there would be a thinning out of miners across chains?

You can trade things like gold to silver or stocks with other stocks without involving currency.
Crypto didn't invent bartering.
I don't really see how security features changes how it should be taxed, it's still an asset that has some sort of value assigned to it.

What exactly is the reasoning that there should be new rules?
