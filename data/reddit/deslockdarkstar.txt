Some shibes are also Bitcoiners, and have been since early 2011. As Cisco said, "The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive."

According to the announcement on their Facebook page, they are not fully closing down US accounts, but they are going to limit them to just "coin-to-coin" transactions.... no fiat exchanges allowed.

I'm really hoping Anonymous is on the case to give Leah McGrath Goodman a good retaliatory doxxing. Just sayin'....

Though, when I first got into Bitcoin, it wasn't like that... most people were new. And there are still people out there (I'm talking other places online and off, not just reddit) who don't have the 'tude. But, yeah... I've noticed this turn for the worse in the BTC community.
Is it any wonder so many alts get started and Doge is.... *ahem*.... "so community, such friendly, much helpful. Wow."

No problem... that's a really good idea actually. Keep us posted on how they respond.

Current Bitcoin price is $802.78
In a recent interview, Rick Falkvinge called a value of $2-5 million PER BITCOIN, blowing the Winklevoss twins' $40,000 prediction out of the water (
Yeah, we're in the early days.

I agree with DrinkHotWater... don't sell your Bitcoin. There is a service that let's you use a credit card to buy Dogecoin. They are totally legit. I bought 5000 for $11... no big deal. Get a few orders like that, play with the currency and see if you like it.

That's not really what we're talking about here.... we're talking about acting like an ass to newbies. What does that have to do with anything you just posted here?
Thanks for playing.

Pass some this way. :-D

Thanks for the heads up on this... I just used that hashtag in a tweet, and I wouldn't have known about it otherwise.

I'm pretty much leaning towards "not".

I'm with ya, brotha.... I am Satoshi, too.

The 2000 or so people who downvoted this don't know history-making words when they see them. Great post, Erik.

This is actually exciting, even more so than the Newsweek piece exposing who THEY think is Satoshi. While it doesn't conclusively prove that Newsweek's "suspect" isn't Satoshi (after all, if I were Satoshi, and Newsweek outed me, I would probably log into an old profile that I haven't used in 3 years to post "I am not [Deslock's real name]"), it is an ACTUAL post by the ACTUAL Satoshi.
Freakin' Amazing.
It's like a Bigfoot sighting or something.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:27:53
Agreed. What is needed is some sort of central information "clearinghouse" or consumer information website which is crypto-oriented and will allow people to easily find out what banks are crypto friendly, etc, etc.

Dammit! Thanks transaction malleability!

Does that happen often over there? I always thought they use PasteBin for doxxings.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:48:51
I kind of don't really think that's an excuse. I've been in the Bitcoin scene since 2011 and there are more communities for Bitcoin than just reddit, both online and in RL. While there are assholes everywhere, most communities for Bitcoin elsewhere seem more helpful than here.... even Bitcointalk is friendlier!
Here's my take.... Bitcoiners want the masses to accept and use Bitcoin, and the more successful they are at achieving that, the more asshole-ish they act towards the newcomers? Yeah, that's a formula for fail.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:07:01
Well, it would have been pretty boring with nothing but Bitcoin logos. Plus, "crypto" pretty much includes many coins these days, so.....
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:08:20
Nope, I can get in there OK. Try again now and see what happens.

Your analysis is the "inside-the-system" answer to the question... I have no problem or issue with inside-the-system activists or activism. I just see it as terribly bureaucratic and inefficient. Inside-the-system types need to understand and accept that we outside-the-system types are going to drive innovation on this (and many other things) forward and not wait for a vote. Google "agorism".
For example, where would the internet and computer technology be if it hadn't been developed largely outside the pervue of The State as a "full partner"? We'd still be chugging along with WIndows 95-level technology and Web 1.0
So it is with Bitcoin and its adoption by the marketplace and real people, where it counts... not with bureaucrats who barely understand the Internet, let alone Bitcoin (does the phrase "tubes filled with cats" ring any bells?).
Again, Google "agorism" and you will see how Bitcoin will continue to thrive, especially as more Cyprus, Spain, Ireland and Iceland scenarios play out in the months and years to come.

You can buy groceries online, from businesses that accept Bitcoin. End-run around The State.

Hahahaha.... I hear ya on the GF issues. Mine isn't onboard yet, and I think she's sick of me talking about Bitcoin.

Ad hominem attack.... and you're calling me childish?
Also, your comment hardly fits the bill for "constructive". Go play with the other children.... adults are talking here.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:31:17
And.... I don't think "Bombastic loser talk" qualifies as "constructive". Thanks for playing.

Very interesting, theymos... some of the stuff you say here, I did not know. Also glad to know that a fellow libertarian is so deeply involved. Keep up the good work!

Hahaha.... honestly? I was going to include it, but couldn't find a vector graphic of the logo online, and I was too lazy to recreate it.

"This kind of thing" is exactly what Bitcoins is all about, and always has been. Do some research into the history of it, going further back than just 2009... the very idea has been about encryption and rendering The State impotent.
Sorry if you don't like it, but the facts are the facts regardless of how far you bury your head in the sand. As is stated in the piece, "It is also something of which those with a more mainstream view in the Bitcoin community need to be aware.... this digital coin that you love was designed to destroy The State that you worship. Sooner or later, you are going to have to make a decision as to which one you value more."
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:07:53
Ditto. This would also be awesome as a sticker.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:01:01
Thank you! I didn't even know there was a Bitcoin tipping system in place here.

This chart was posted right after the "bubble pop crash" the other week...
As you can see, the end of the crash is a "return to the mean". I was hoping the "despair" phase would go lower and last a little longer (because that is the time to buy), but I suspect that this new price rise COULD be that "return to the mean", with the mean being higher than what is reflected on this chart.
(incidentally, the chart isn't Bitcoin specific, but a more general chart of any commodity which gets hot quickly.)
