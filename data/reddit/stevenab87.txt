That’s unfortunate. VPN maybe?
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:09:18


  
If that ever happened then it would just be some new fork coin, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:48:39
Your statement doesn’t even have consensus though.
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:24:21
It's free. GDAX covers the cost. If you transfer out 1 BTC; you will receive 1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:07:52
Yeah, significantly. About 15x cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:39:12
That's like obese Americans blaming Canada because they make maple syrup. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:57:37
Yeah, prob not a great idea.

You aren't thinking about it correctly. You are still essentially paying $1000 for the cc points regardless of what the price of BTC does. Example: You pay $25,000 for $24,000 of BTC ($24k + $1k in fees); let's say your BTC goes up 10%, your BTC is now worth $26.4k. Not bad! On the other hand, assume you spent $25k with no fee, so you have $25k worth of BTC. Goes up 10% and its now worth $27.5k. You are still out the $1k in fees + an additional 10% because you had less btc.

Two comments and you haven't made your point...?  
 &gt;U think these Wall St fat cats and investment sharks and hackers are gonna sit back and let The average Joe get all this silly money without getting involved or trying to control it  
  
Ok, so what are you suggesting that they are going to do?


  
Ok. So you have no idea what a blockchain is?  
  


  
People will always cheat. What is your point and what does that have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:23:56
Ah ok. I have no idea how valid that guys statement was. I just figured you were doing the math based on info he gave in his post. I imagine your estimate might be closer to the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:21:41
Yes you still owe tax on the cap gains.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:58
You have yet to provide any iota of substance so far. “manipulated same as anything else.” Ok... what do you mean by that... manipulate how exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:30:22


  
I'm gonna say that is probably the worst thing you can do. The most important thing about bitcoin is self-education. If one can't figure out how to research themselves how to buy bitcoin, they shouldn't be buying bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:36
Converting BTC into anything.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:31:26
If it the bitcoin is worth more in USD value when you spent it then when you purchased it, then yes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:23
I don’t know why people are so focused on a future where crypto will be used for day to day transactions in first world places. Bitcoin or any crypto won’t replace using a credit card for a very long time. I believe in the ideology, but don’t anticipate putting my credit card away anytime in my lifetime. Bitcoin can have massive value just by being a store of value or a means to transfer money across any border in the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:54:55
Fees are baked into the exchange rate I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:25:24
Probably closer to only 12mil when accounting for lost btc and Satoshi’s stash! Also you mean billionaires?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:45:44
Damn you generous fool!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:38:15
You didn’t gain zero. You tripled your money. So when you sell $1000 worth, $666 is gains. You would pay normal income tax on the gains if you held for less than a year and 15% only if you held for more than a year.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:28:18
Tax is realized as soon as you hit the sell button. Doesn’t matter if you re-invest. This is for the lovely USA.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:02:15
Guessing math isn’t your best subject?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:18:12
Don’t really need to be concerned about drawing attention of authorities if you are paying your taxes. Ain’t nothing wrong with moving money around as much as you like as long as pay the tax man. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:06:21
Hieroglyphics actually.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:51:04


  
The "massive" price drop to back to the price it only first reached 3 weeks ago?  
  


  


  
Bitcoin is definitely not for you, you should prob sell.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:21:47
Buying a lambo with bitcoin vs. selling bitcoin for fiat and buying lambo with fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:27:33


  
  
The fuck? Did he really say that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:10:25
You never made one. You just spouted bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:33:32
Normal income rate is the tax for short-term. Long term would be 15% for your situation.

Did you the unique code they give you on the memo of the wire? It will be different each time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:09:11
You really don’t know what the word objective means.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:15:59
It’s sort of the exact opposite. You are locked into the price at the current date. In a futures contract you are locked into the price at a future date.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:42
Think you misunderstood. All he said was 300b/1t = about 1/3.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:53:08
Trezor or Nano. I prefer Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:32:07


  
Anyone with half a brain knows how to Google. It's not some state secret how to buy bitcoin. If you are half-way smart you can figure out to do your own research.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:48:23
Who the fuck refers to their bitcoin to 8 decimal places?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:05:14
Fair point.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:08:50
Probably 30% or so.
@_date: 2018-08-04 05:12:33
"Physically-Settled" means real bitcoin as opposed to just cash-equivalent collateral.
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:47:31


I had the same problem one night about ten years ago. Thankfully I chose the right hole.

I don't think sponsoring UFC would be "one-upping" dogecoin. Sponsoring a Nascar car is way cooler.

Just watch the movie Inception, it’s all explained there.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:08:57
And what exactly are you being credited with? Beanie babies? Tulips?
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:53:59
Well yeah, you didn’t have 500 btc.
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:31:22
Nobody specified cash. What are you spending when you use a credit card?
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:21:01
I didn’t think you were actually serious. Might as well just stop using a phone if people are forced to pay for the privilege of calling you. Definitely won’t get spam calls if you don’t have a phone.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:59:13
That doesn’t make sense. The entirely of your monetary spending only occurs paying when your fiends back for bar tabs? That’s oddly specific. How else do you survive? Food? Rent? Buying literally anything?
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:27:28
They don’t. OP is just full of shit.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:05:13
Less than 1%.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:22:28
What did the cancellation email say
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:44:45
Lower fees. Nicer platform.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:27:41
You contradicted yourself, mate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:46:38
I’ve used it on mobile web with my iPhone no problem.

He’s talking about Osama, no obama. Still though, 2/10 troll.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:27:59
IAMAL, but you are probably on the hook legally since you don't have plausible deniability. Paying for the BTC was part of an implied contract for receiving it that you entered into. It doesn't really change the legal agreement just because you received it before paying.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:52:23
Yes you do. Don’t know what you are referring to.
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:35:13
Did you drop of school before or after the 9th grade?
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:40:38
Nah, that amount is relatively peanuts and would not impact the price at all.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:53:51
A huge short was liquidated likely contributing to the squeeze.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:41:17
Yeah, but he’s saying this was the most upvoted “Bitcoin $10k!!” post when it first hit.
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:47:16
Who is kidding?
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:17:35
I don’t think he was trying to get you to solve a riddle. Question is obviously meant to be answered while ignoring the theoretical opportunity for arbitrage.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:24:20
My mom just texted me “Bitcoin???” lol
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:20:59
Amen. Could not have said it better myself.

I've got a fever, and the only prescription, is more cowbell!
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:49:10
A rise from $500 to over $900 in a week is a slow crawl??? derp.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:05:25


"the amount of money"?? What do you mean by that? Mkt cap is the value of the whole market. BTC in circulation X current price.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:15:55
It is not profitable to mine bitcoins at this moment. You will pay more for electricity. $50 is way off, how did you get there?
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:56:28
This is really cool. I love when young kids are enthusiastic about entrepreneurship and finance!
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:23:28
You cannot at the moment. By the time you receive a miner, the difficulty will make it nearly impossible for you to recoup your investment.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:22:19
It will burst tomorrow at 4:34pm ET. And the price will drop to $689.10.

@_date: 2013-11-29 00:10:26
I just made $100 by buying/selling .5 BTC a couple times.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:33:04
Logical fallacy. Then why aren't you converting every single dollar you have to BTC if it's worth $10,000.
edit: an example to help you understand. say you wanted to buy legos for $100 usd. At the same time, you could convert that $100usd to .125 BTC. So there is no difference bewteen spending $100 usd or .125 BTC. It does not matte what your own perceived value is.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:44:50
Wasn't trying to be a dick. Just saying it impossible to know. Everyone is guessing. If anyone knew, we would all be rich. All anyone can say is do what you think is best, and don't put in money you cannot afford to lose. It is very speculative.
