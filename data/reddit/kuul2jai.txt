I think a transaction with a NLOCKTIMEVERIFY sometime in the future will not be broadcast through the network at all. I think such a transaction will only be considered valid by a bitcoin node once the locktime is passed. Correct me if I am wrong...

SEPA transfers are free in most (if not all ?) countries that particpate and no, you can't just withdraw from other people's accounts, usually the account holder has to give you permission first (lots of companies bill you this way). Additionally, you have some time to reverse such withdrawals in case of problems.
Before using IBANs instead of classical bank account numbers/sort code became mandatory for national transfers (&lt;2014), national bank transfers were generally free for private customers. Payments to SEPA countries had to cost the same as national transfers, so they were also free. :)

because downloading the whole blockchain from the beginning is inefficient and puts a lot of load on the bitcoin network. bittorrent however is made for file sharing and meant for this. apart from that it's much faster using the bootstrap.dat file to set up a new full bitcoin node (hours instead of days)

Good point!
They could also just keep the bitcoins which users pay to them and pay back small amounts. it's almost guaranteed that they  will make a profit as long as difficulty keeps increasing. If difficulty decreases substantially then it would get pretty bad for fake cloud miners. 
A cloud mining project I used to use was always paying from an address which was funded from a know address of a mining pool.

@_date: 2014-07-15 22:04:50
you always create a key pair consisting of a private key and a public key. You give away your public key to third parties so that they can encrypt information for you. Only you, as you have kept your private key private, are able to decrypt the information.
Regarding the math behind this I would point you to google some good tutorials. But most commonly large numbers are factored (in the case of RSA) and points on elliptic curves are used (EC crypto). 
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:53:10
They are both correct, the chart of blockorigin.pfoe.be shows the last 2016 blocks (aka roughly 14 days if a block time of 10 minutes is assumed), the chart on blockchain.info shows only the last 24/48 hours.
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:19:50
You can either use the 1.9.8 version, just download the tar.gz or zip and execute the electrum executable or if you want the latest development version (&gt;2.0) you need to git clone the development repo:

You could rent a cheap virtual server and host a full node there. From my own experience, at least I get bored of the good feeling of running a full node after a couple of months. When that day comes it's easy to just cancel the vserver instead of having unused hardware lying around. :)

You are fine, it only affects transactions from a blockchain.info wallet in a specific time window (roughly 3 hours a few of days ago).
Edit: addresses generated during the time on blockchain.info might also be affected by the weak randomness.

@_date: 2014-10-20 12:59:22
When using exchanges, yes, you can usually show that you withdrew the coins from an exchange. In case of blockchain.info's shared send it's IMHO impossible to prove that you tumbled your coins.

Slightly off-topic: I really dislike that circle sends e-mails like "You sent $xx.xx (0.0000xxxxB TC) to 1234556677BTCAddress". 
E-Mail as a protocol is privacy-compromised, who knows how many entities see these e-mails. They know exactly that me, the receiver of these e-mails, has sent as certain amount of BTC to a certain btc address. This partially deanonymizes bitcoin. I don't like it.

If you randomly choose enough blocks, e.g. 24 out of ~300,000 blocks, the number of possibilities becomes so high that precalculating them is next to impossible. E.g. 24 blocks -&gt; 10^131 combinations
Edit: Actually, I guess 2^128 (10^38) combinations would already be enough to make precalculation impractical. That would be just 7 blocks 
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:19:55
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:18:35
It would be better to choose more than one block per party. E.g. 7 randomly chosen blocks would already be 2^128 (10^34) combinations which are next to impossible to precompute.

Well, the javascript source code can be analysed and it shows that new btc addresses are generated locally (with your own entropy source) and are locally encrypted. Only this encrypted information is sent to blockchain.info's servers.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:40:31
Unfortunately there is not much that can be done about this as these messages are just regular bitcoin transactions. The information is encoded into the receiving addresses, the satoshis spent in each transaction are burned/lost forever.
One thing could be to raise the dust limit to make this kind of spamming more expensive. However, that will not stop these people as they have some kind of incentive and will just pay the higher price to reach their goal of storing information in the blockchain.
Another thing could be that the mining nodes exclude transactions for which the receiving addresses can be decoded into ascii to a certain percentage. But that has certain caveats and you would introduce a two-class system of what is and what is not a valid transaction. Also, some miners will still include these transactions and eventually they will get confirmed...
Edit: The amount of junk transactions from certain dice games is much worse for the size of the block chain than any of these information storing people.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:14:15
This is what I just came up with:
Two persons, let's call them A and B, meet and would like to quickly agree on a random number for whatever reason. 
A chooses a bitcoin block, B chooses a bitcoin block. The corresponding block hashes can now be simply hashed together (sha256) to create a tamperproof random number with at the same time good entropy. 
Now there is one problem though: One of the two persons has to announce their chosen block first. The problem with that is that there are only 300,000^2 possible ways to choose two blocks out of 300,000. That's just 90 billion possibilities which can be precomputed. 
If A sends his block, B could quickly react and choose a block that would work to his advantage (whatever that advantage might be...).
The solution to that is to agree on a pepper, e.g. each person specifies 50% of a phrase (longer and more random better).
This pepper is hashed together with the chosen block hash of each person.
peppered_hash_A, peppered_hash_B are shared with the other person. This sets the chosen blocks in stone.
When A announces his real block hash, B cannot chose another one of his precomputed ones because he has already published his own peppered_hashB. 
As mentioned in the beginning, now hash_A and hash_B can be hashed together to produce the final number.

@_date: 2016-06-30 09:29:57
To be more precise, the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. If a block takes 20 instead of 10 minutes, the normal difficulty period of 2016 blocks * 10 minutes = 14 days would double itself to 2016 blocks * 20 minutes = 28 days.
As another point I believe there are certain limitations in how much the difficulty can go down or go up. So, if I remember correctly it would take more than one adjustment to bring the block time back to 10 minutes...

That just means that the private key (=the secret we are looking for) is passed as a parameter to the script. 
In other words, the secret is nowhere to be found in the source code, it just exists in memory on that one server we are searching for. 
We have to find the right server, present it the correct passphrase, then the private key will be revealed (the logic for this can be found in the source code).

Sorry to hear that you get hit by one of these things. 
I've read quite a bit about them but one thing I can't find anything about is the modification dates of the encrypted files. Do they just have today's date (or the date of encryption). After decryption, do they keep the most current date or are they somehow reset to their original dates?
I rely quite a bit on modification dates of my files so if I would get hit by ransomware I guess my precious modified dates would get lost.

It's not exactly 10 minutes.
Basically, as soon as new a block is found and validated by the miners, they start hashing immediately with whatever transactions they have in their mempool. If they don't have any transactions the block is empty. 
Statistically it takes on average 10 minutes until a valid hash is found. But that's just an average, I am sure you have seen blocks that are created seconds after the first one. That is simply luck or a sign for a too low difficulty. 
Every 2016 blocks  (~14 days) the difficulty is re-evaluated. If the average blocktime is less than 10 minute it is increased and vice versa.

Hi there!
I have a question about ledger wallet: 
Is there any way to store labels for addresses or transactions on your website?
If yes, what happens if I reset the wallet to a new wordlist, then later reset it to the first wordlist and login again? In theory, the labels (if stored) should be still there!
What if your website ever goes offline or vanishes completely? Are there any alternatives to get our private keys (e.g. a script we can run to at least get a list of keys?)
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:11:18
The label sync plugin solves the issue with the labels, even trustless  (labelectrum.herokuapp.com just sees your e-mail address you signed up with but has no idea about your bitcoin addresses because everything sent there is aes-256-cbc encrypted). Since you are using Tor the IP is also meaningless...
THe only thing that bugs me that the connection to labelectrum is currently http only.

Use the public key of the sender's address to encrypt the secret so that only the sender can decrypt it? Store this encrypted secret in blockchain as ASCII or OP_RETURN message? Maybe a link to a oneclickhoster if the secret is relatively big?

I also got mine a few days ago. At first I was like "meh, why did I order this again?" (apart from supporting the crowdfunding...). 
But then I spent some time with it, created a few paperwallets and it hit me that this is probably the most secure way for me to create bitcoin addresses (and potentially HD wallets). I got pretty excited and I am extremely glad I ordered one. 
Btw, you don't need a printer. You can also just boot into a Linux live system (Tails...) and access the generated keys there because the device acts like a usb drive. Then you can simply write down the private key onto a piece of paper and do not have to worry if your live system's RNG has enough entropy.

I believe you are writing with the main developer of Electrum :)

Clarification on the technical details: 
The leaker splits a file into chunks. Each chunk is hashed and the resulting checksum is used to generate a bitcoin private key. From this private key a public key (not the bitcoin address!) is derived. The public key is used to create a password which is used to encrypt each chunk.   
Through another step a bitcoin address can be calculated from the public key. Each bitcoin address now corresponds to one chunk of the file and gets published. 
(I leave out the part where people can check the validity of the  leak for now).
People send bitcoins to all the published bitcoin addresses. When the leaker finally spends these donated bitcoins he automatically reveals the public key for each bitcoin address. Since the public key was the basis for each chunk's password the chunks can now be decrypted.
Edit/Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with darkleaks, I was just confused by the wording (public keys vs. bitcoin addresses) and figured I wouldn't be the only one.

OK, my bad, I didn't test that properly...
But what I know works for sure (:)) is specifying a proxy as a parameter:
    electrum -p socks5:localhost:9150
But I think then you again can't change the proxy in the GUI.
One possibility is to edit the config file in .electrum but it doesn't exist before the first run. So, you would havee to have one from an older installation...

May I ask which plan you are using? The one for 15 USD? I am thinking that maybe one of the SATA plans would also be sufficient. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:39:36
I think they dropped support for that a while ago

My history goes back until Sept 2014. What happens if you click on "Transaction" (top menu panel?)

I agree with all your points and want to stress again that I am not affiliated with darkleaks. I simply wrote a summary of how it works because I was a bit confused about the description they gave.

Your point about privacy is actually a very good one. 
By now every Electrum server in existence could have potentially logged all my bitcoin addresses (even though some servers claim they do not log addresses/ip addresses).
I also don't have a solution for this problem. Maybe one could connect to one server that you trust exclusively to minimize exposure?

It might be a good idea to consider running bitcoin as non-root.
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:34:32
I was thinking the same thing. What if I want to share a pdf or a zip file? Due to the random selection of preview chunks the chunks will be kind of useless? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:06:46
like the idea!
first thing for a proof of concept that came to mind is using simply sshfs to mount a remote file system containing the full blockchain (needs some unprivileged user on that machine) and symlink some blocks from there and see if that works...

you first have to convert USD to SLL (Second Life Linden Dollars) and from there to BTC

it used to work on virwox.com (you sell your btc for second life linden dollars and than to USD, withdraw to paypal). The fees accumulate due to the many sell steps, though... but if you don't have an alternative this has to be good enough...

Check out 
There are already many encrypted messages being stored in the blockchain. I would be interested how many secret services are trying to brute force these messages! :)
