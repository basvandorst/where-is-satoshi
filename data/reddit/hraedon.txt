I expect that due to the seemingly sincere belief people here have that BTC represents a fundamental change to the way we will use money. If proper security requirements are so burdensome that the system is practically unusable (yes, requiring a dedicated offline, non-Windows PC is wildly unrealistic for all but a select few), it will never gain acceptance outside of the true believers and opportunists. 
Every security failure should be seen as attack on the mainstream viability of BTC, not as some sort of stumbling block that will inevitably be overcome. You can scream "caveat emptor" until you're blue in the face, but unless BTC advocates get serious about *and* sympathetic to those concerns, BTC's relevance to the vast majority of people will remain nonexistent.

BTC was designed with the goal of obviating centralization for the express purpose of preventing or subverting governmental interference. This is almost by definition a libertarian aim. 
That doesn't make it good or bad, but BTC was absolutely written with an agenda.

It is always an eye-opening experience for people to see how quickly an unpatched XP or 7 install is compromised *without user interaction* once you put it on the internet.

They're pragmatic. They bought Instagram to head off the threat it represented to a core component of their business, and after their efforts with FB Messenger failed they bought Whatsapp. The alternative is to keep grinding your face against the wall trying to compete with more successful and nimble competitors (see: Windows Phone) while the unbundling of your product erodes your competitiveness. 
Coke has acquired a ton of companies for the same general reason: Minute Maid, Barq's, and Odwalla are all acquisitions whose purpose was to expand their dominance of the market in areas where they had previously failed to compete. Apple famously hasn't spent more than a half billion on any single company, but their corporate structure is basically unique at their size. J&amp;J spent $20 billion to acquire a company to give them inroads into a new market they had failed to penetrate on their own, and so on.

Windows Phone 8 is a very solid OS, 3 years ago. Standards have changed: we enjoy a system now where retailers, banks, and credit card companies to bear the vast majority of the risk. This system is nearly universal, and requires almost no technical knowledge to utilize. 
There are costs, to be sure, but to the average consumer—at least in the west—the fees and costs of this system are not sufficiently burdensome to spur BTC adoption. If the best that BTC can offer is a chance to feel superior to the fiat sheep while putting your holdings at substantial risk if you want even modest convenience, its mainstream appeal is sharply limited.

The more accurate analogy is whether or not making coffee with beans you harvest from a personal coffea plant would constitute income, and the strict answer would be [yes]( I think. 
Realistically, no one is going to care about the small stuff. This provides guidance for people with significant holdings and accurately reflects the current dominant usage of BTC.

Adoption of BTC as the de facto currency *would* be at this point akin to adopting the dollar. 
For nation-states, the idea of standardizing on a currency that—through its very nature—will only be deflationary is pretty risky. Debt becomes a much harder problem to solve when you can't take the edge off through inflation.

There's only doubt if we for some reason ignore Satoshi's clear stance when posting the BTC whitepaper and their further contributions in the thread. 
I mean, I suppose we can't know to a literal certainty what lies in a person's heart, but that seems to me to be pointless hairsplitting since all indications are that their sentiments were sincere.

m-n has been availableish for more than two years and is only starting to see adoption. 
I'm also not sure that you could call an institution whose accounts are secured via m-n a "bank" in the traditional sense, since the ability to use deposits to generate income is a requirement.

Local currencies become "unusable" due to hyperinflation. Mild to moderate inflation can spur investment and spending due to the adverse impact it has on static wealth.
Regardless, my concerns are more that debt denominated in BTC would only become more onerous over time, rather than less. Whether or not that would end up being a serious problem is to me an open question, but a question nonetheless.

If BTC had value aside from the ability to cash out into a fiat currency, its extreme volatility wouldn't be as big of a problem. As it stands, the 20-40% daily swings are wildly in excess of any stable currency (where a daily swing of a single percent is noteworthy) and it is ridiculous to pretend that this is not something that justifiably gives many people pause.

No one–including the IRS–is going to care about low level stuff like this, just like people who don't report tips aren't commonly caught or jailed. 
Bitcoin millionaires cashing out and expecting to evade taxes, however, should be pretty easy to track down.

Sure, the circumstances don't need to be anything specific for BTC to succeed or fail. The question, though, was whether or not BTC is an apolitical technology, and it simply is not. The ideology that drove its creation permeates every element of its core design. 
That isn't to say that it couldn't be promoted by a leader or country with much different aims, but that is nothing new.

1: You owe capital gains taxes whenever you spend, trade or cash out. Until you do that you owe no taxes. 
2: You [will owe]( taxes. Whether or not you can expect scrutiny depends a lot on how lucky you are and how much undocumented business you do in BTC. 
3: See above. Usually it will technically be treated as a set of separate transactions, with a common denominator being USD. You'll owe tax at the time of the transaction unless you try to pass it off as a 1033 exchange (uncharted territory in BTC, as far as I am aware).

If their money had been in a bank but denominated in BTC there would have been absolutely no difference.

The question is more "if BTC effectively lost the ability to be converted into fiat currency, would it still be valuable?" Right now, I think that the answer is pretty clearly no, but there's no reason that that will be true forever. Gold and silver have values far exceeding their industrial applications, and the same could easily become true of bitcoin. 
It just isn't true yet.
