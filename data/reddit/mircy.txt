They have it legally, he didnt file a claim. Is that so hard?

Well, positive then. After one of the world's best investors decried bitcoin I think making Bloomberg in a positive light will be difficult

how is it fucked?

You went Godwin's Law immediately. I highly doubt that the death of innocent people is in any way comparable to seizing drug money regardless of legality. 
Under world courts like the Nuremberg trials I'd say that the latter would be considered legal

Godwin's law is when you compare something to the Nazis in an attempt to make something sound ultimately evil 
in which case you did
I do deny that because the government seizing things that are illegal has been part of our finely refined legal system that's existed over the course of a couple hundred years and not the Nazis takeover of post WWI-Germany where they enacted a bunch of laws made to target a specific group of people and mark them for extermination. 
Clearly that's the same thing as the federal government taking away your coins and I'm *sorry* I didn't make that distinction clear enough in the initial post.

They practiced legal seizure as they have for anything else that was illegal. The Silk Road sold illegal drugs. They allowed the founder to claim his coins, as he did, and the profits from the site itself were also up there for a month and a half. Nobody claimed them.

except Doge is worth something now, that's the difference.

It went through the system exactly as anything else that's seized has. I'm not sure why bitcoins used to by illegal drugs should be treated differently.

when that media airtime consists of bitcoin being rejected in china, falling horrifically, and mt gox failing, 50k to have a crypto presented in a positive fun light suddenly doesn't seem so bad

implying bitcoin doesn't crash every other day
