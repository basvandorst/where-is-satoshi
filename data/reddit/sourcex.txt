Expect for coinbase, gemini and Bitstamp I doubt any big exchange uses USD. All of them use tethers. Bitfinex Binance Bittrex are in top 3 and all of them use tethers. So yes it is a concern.

Which exchange?

If this is the case, there will always be uncertainty. I hope this uncertainty comes to a stability without any outside regulation.

I always wonder how do the market decides the price of one bitcoin? 
Or is this price increase related to corresponding downfall in Bitcoin cash price?

The blocks ending in 002 are the ones that signalled segwit? But why?

The greater fool theory makes sense as of now. No one is buying bitcoin because they see the power of decentralization (except the believers like me). They are buying because of the price rise. Now, that is exactly what THE ECONOMIST is saying.

I wonder why is this article downvoted. Also, interesting to note the title for this post - my guess is he specifically mentioned "how BCH could win" in this sub so that he can check if this article gets him banned or removed.  
I like his arguments and its time people focused on bitcoin technology discussion than price and civil wars. Thanks for writing

Bitfinex says tether are incorporated in Hong Kong, but there are no proofs

China has learnt one thing - Never ban something when you can manage it (read- Internet access)

That probably the reason that ban might be real. They are just buying more of BTC while they can, before ban. After that it will increasingly become difficult to buy them!  I just hope its FUD, but this is not a great sign.

Well there is XRP for that

Instead of withdrawing can it be exchanged to different crpytocoins time being and re converted to Bitcoin if you are not able to remove coins? I did this on poloneix

Using technical analysis on bitcoin trading made me question as to how is bitcoin priced? Does the supply decide or the demand or the difficulty or just the FUD surrounding it?  
 And who commands the price ? We, the users right?

This doesn't change the a thing for the altcoins traded on the poloniex, right? Because they are generally traded with btc
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:25:00
Even I would like to know.

I couldn't find any reference in regards to conversion in the original post. Sure. If I convert, I won't have it in Btc or BCC but that's the point, I can't reconvert it to btc anytime I want.

bitcoin won't suddenly increase from 21 to 42 mn. Great shitpost
