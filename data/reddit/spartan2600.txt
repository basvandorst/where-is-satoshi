Most financial transactions don't involve physical currency to begin with. In fact, credit, non physical currency existed long before hard currency. Bitcoin isn't anything new in that regard.

Golman Sachs doesn't give a damn about bitcoin, because bitcoin poses no threat whatsoever to it, or any other bank. I'm not against bitcoin, but don't confuse exchanging bitcoins for transgressing capitalism.

Do you not know that the banks directly choose the members of the Federal Reserve? The only government control over the Fed is the appointment of the chairman. Besides that though, the banks and investment houses, like Goldman, have assets in the tens of trillions, and make hundreds of trillions in trades every year. Even if it is true that there are $200 million worth of bitcoin-denominated assets, that's chump change to the banks. Also, the banks have the assets that *reallly matter*, the means of production. I'm doubtful the bitcoin-denominated assets and transactions are important ones anywhere near the locus of action in our capitalist economy.
I don't know of any reason to be against bitcoin, just like there's no reason to be against moving money into credit unions, but in both cases, neither matters much, and neither will ever significantly change the economic and government status quo. And if credit unions or bitcoin ever did pose a threat to power, there'd be attacked by the banking industry, which is the biggest influence on government now. There isn't even a little push back from power against credit unions or bitcoin, let alone some serious and systematic counterattack that would be expected if these things were a real threat.
