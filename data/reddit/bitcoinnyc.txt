I would love to interview you for the let's talk bitcoin podcast, (if you wish) we can edit out the pauses with the translator and the interview should come out splendidly. I'm sure a whole bunch of people are interested in your project

NYC has be growing very nicely the BitcoinNYC meetup group just passed 900 today and we get 50+ at our weekly meeting and there are about 30+ at the satoshi squares on monday and 20 + at the other random events throughout the week. Getting the recent Bitcoin Center helps A LOT too. And we are about to announce a Bitcoin Teller there too  so I'm assuming we are going to see an upsurge.

Even better than that, we are working in conjunction with a colleague who just got a Monet Transmitter exemption from FinCEN 
, there are a number of industry changing announcements like this coming out of NYC in the next month or two. I'd be happy to take the counter party to a bet on it because I know for a fact its going to happen.

That number goes up to 1 in 3 when you realize they don't count humans under the age of 18 or "illegal" humans.
