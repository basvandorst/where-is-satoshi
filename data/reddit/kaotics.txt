Or there are serious problems with Bitcoin and you are just sticking your head in the sand.
But yea dude keep HODLing on ���� you HODL that shit till it's worthless again. Market is already moving to solutions that work, scale, and have low fees.
But yea dude. Lightning network is coming.. eventually ����
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:21:17
Because everyone here is a fucking ostritch. They would rather not deal with Bitcoins problems head on but bury their heads in the sand and just scream HODL like a mentally retarded 5 year old.
And people wonder why outsiders laugh at crypto investors. Holy blind fucking sheep.

Welp your lack of legitimate responses here is actually making me think about no longer using Binance. Wtf mate? 3 months is an Unacceptable length of time especially without any response to the user updating him of the current status. Not how a professional exchange should be ran. How in the world / why would this (after having the relevant documents sent) take upwards of 3+ months to resolve? There are plenty of services on the internet that can verify this information. Not to mention services in relevant countries that can do this for you even if you need to charge the user a fee to do this (which is acceptable) the length of time is just silly.

Bravo sir. Fucking bravo. This is what Bitcoin is for!!

Not necessarily. If you wake up tomorrow and its 15k, gonna sound pretty stupid.
Worse that happens it crashes back to 5-6k and works it way back up over the next 6 months (like it has done in the past). They will get there money back, just not instantly like the last 2-3 months.
I mean it really depends on your trading game plan. I don't have big money to blow so I buy dips. It's pretty guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:25:17
Can we start asking exchanges to go with BCASH over bitcoin cash. I think we should really put the pressure on them to. Because it is no longer Bitcoin. To call it Bitcoin is deceptive.

Gosh damnit. It's a coin to use to transfer to different currencies. That's it's damn primary focus.
It's the Rosetta stone of fucking currencies without the centralized bank.
That's its primary use. Period. It can be used as a currency, but chances are it's going to be used as an intermediary currency for global transactions. For travel and other things that require you to have a universal currency, or something that needs you to jump 5-6 dif countries currency very quickly.
Like if the EU didn't exist (the conglomerate of countries), I would ONLY take bitcoin with me abroad to the EU. Then exchange small slivers of it in each country I visited for the home currency.

Exactly, and those people who bought at like 240-250 and had stop loss orders in at 200$ or lower still made money because they locked profits in / minimized loss. There is nothing wrong taking a hit then buying back into strength

Hold coin and cash... Never be mad again. Cash for when the price dips, coins for when it goes up... Sell 1-2 high, and take that cash, hold onto it. When it drops 20 dollars you buy a few with that money.
Trust me, it's help keep me sane over the last few days and it allowed me to get back the .4 I lost a few days ago being impatient (and playing with my full amount of coins).
Hope this helps
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:12:01
@ 800? No, the volume and the trends after crashes (over the past year) suggest we will see 500~'s again before we take back off. I've got a big buy order down there waiting. If that 900 - 450 drop shows, we are only 1 big sell off away from a crash
But seriously though man, I had 30 or so back when they were like a 1$ something, told the wife I should drop 800$ in em and she laughed me off.
She aint laughing now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:02:25
Depends if the Exchange you are using supports it. Now that said, if it doesn't support that directly on the website you can use alternate trading programs. Just be careful which one you use because of course some could have hidden code to siphon off coins. However this should be a non issue if you dont give the program the permissions to do so. I personally use QT Bitcoin Trader and set up a Rule that if the price goes below a certain amount to sell all my coins or inversely if it goes up past a certain amount to buy as much coins as I can with my money.
This allows me to lead a normal life without having to watch the charts 24/7. Because I don't know about you guys but I went to bed 1 hour before the 260 crash. Pissed me off, Stop Loss orders mean you never have to deal with that.
QT Bitcoin Trader: 
**Edit**: I use QT Because it's open source personally and being able to view the source code is a big +
**Edit2**: If you do use QT Bitcoin Trader LEAVE IT OPEN 24/7. It has to be open to apply the rules since the** rules are a program specific function (not a function of the Exchange). So if you close the program it wont trigger the rule. I learned that the hard way, hopefully it will save you from that headache
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:56:10

Take 10,952,975.00000000 (I believe it goes to 8 digits) and then move the decimal. 109,529,750.0000000 and viola. Bit coin just got a whole shit ton of more coins and the price just dropped by a factor of 10.
Boom goes the dynamite (also fixes shortage problem). This happens again. Guess what you do, move it to the HUNDREDS place, rinse repeat profit. This is by design, also leaves it in place for those who want to trade in actual WHOLE bit coins. I am just saying that the trading centers and people in general would have to support the move to a lower denomination (correct term?). It's like moving from pounds of gold to ounces of gold, from ounces of gold as the standard of trade to grams of gold.
If you could create some symbol for each of the decimal places you could go from B being the standard for 1 whole bitcoin to like Bx (where x is the icon that denominates what place we are at). So like B^1 (1 in superscript or subscript) would mean 1 decimal place in, B^2 same thing, etc etc

Wow that's mind blowing haha. What are the chances. I actually just today moved that end table to there so I could put my MBP on it. These split tables make it impossible to put the laptop in the middle (wobbles back and forth). Open up the screen and it blocks the monitor. So I snagged that end table from next to the bed and set it up there so I could use the left monitor. So crazy
I totally feel you on the slowdown of PC Specs. I used to be replacing my motherboard/ram/cpu every 2 or so years, now it just seems like I am replacing the video card every 2-3 years instead.

So much wrong with this statement, you need to ask yourself. Why is it any of my business how much money someone else has? Are you insecure? Do you have problems with people having more wealth than you? Does the possibility of someone earning their wealth through trading and working hard worry you? It sounds like it.
I'd stop worrying about who this private entity is, and focus more on your money. They made a smart bet and it sounds like you are jealous. I say kudos to this guy, wish I was him. Smart move.
Only kind of wealth distribution people should be talking about is them spending their own coins on their own merit.

Like if you want to explain why Breakout trading and the use of stop loss therein somehow creates more losses than gains I am open to hearing how this is so. Yet I see none of these, no explanations why your simulations show that there are losses yet everything I read and have experienced tells me otherwise. Not only that countless trading professionals disagree with you and say that stop loss orders and breakout trading in general (which is usually when stop losses are ONLY used) can be fairly successful for speculative trading.
I am not against what you are saying, yet you seem fairly standoffish and provide no insight or any data to back up claims. So ya man, I tend to disagree. 
You are trying to change my mind, you better come with facts instead of assertions.

Ok so here is what happened. Turns out the problem ultimately was with ZigGap (To the guy's honesty, he still has no idea what is going on). Seems like this is a new bug, the dev is working on it (has been on the phone with my friend). However today he woke up and poof 300$ was no where to be found according to his bank, but they researched it a bit more and spotted him the 300 while they found it.
It's weird though because I just did another ZigGap purchase and still no problems with my account.

So, I've been a PC guy pretty much all of my life. Hated on Macs for most of my life. Hated the fact I couldnt build my own killer mac system ya know? Well, after a while I wanted that awesome PC power in my laptop. After a few years of ~ 1000 dollar laptops and unsatisfactory performance for coding / 3d Intensive programs I toyed around with getting a Gaming Laptop. I was looking at the alienware M17 and the MSI Dragon Edition laptops because of the sheer power they had contained in that case. Problem with that was the size factor, I mean these things are MASSIVE and HEAVY. I walk to and from most of my classes and sometimes thats like half a mile on campus lol so couldnt really do that.
Long story short, I got over my hated for the Mac OS and took a hard look at the hardware. I needed a computer I could get a minimum of 1920x1080, be able to play games when I was in between classes and still be able to make games in Unity3d and create 3d Characters is Maya. Not only that here is this laptop that is like 4 pounds. I mean this thing is freaking LIGHT. It has for the most part replaced my PC for my every day use. I use my PC now for Gaming only and am probably putting downstairs with my 42 Inch. This thing has an HDMI port, and 2 thunderport 2 ports so I can connect all 3 of those monitors too it, snag another keyboard, close the lid and boom. I got a powerhouse laptop for home and on the go.
I also figured I could just bootcamp windows and parallels ubuntu and I would be good to go. Wasn't wrong. I get all the programs I need for windows on it and all the ones for mac I couldn't use before.
This is the first laptop I feel satisfied with. Worth every penny.
**Edit**: Not to mention, these have pretty good resale value few years down the road. So you can get some of that money pack to put towards a new edition

Doubt were going under a 100 today.
Edit: Or.... if you look above there is the second wall (draw a line across) and it could be a whole different ball game. Crazy either way
Edit2: Nevermind 1k walls appearing at different spots along 130-150. So crazy right now

It's a crappy situation and we should all be critical of the way the world works, but when you take a small piece of legitimate criticism and spin it into a inflated claims, conspiracies, and half-truths you're damaging the credibility of your own cause.
See where that is bullshit though? People need that money above 100,000 + to survive. Most likely all those people run businesses like that guy. He's ruined, but hey 100,000 that he can't spend because he has to pay everyone else back is consolation right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:03:45
Here's my strategy. Sell order for me is in at 1,000,000. Why so high you may ask? We know a few people play with amounts that are in the 1,000,000$ dollar range. I'm hoping someone makes a slip up and puts in a 1,000,000$ buy order at a mil a coin.
It's a long shot but, it would be so cool to wake up and see 7 mil in my account. Kind of sucks it would be at their expense but uh...
I can't tell you how many times i've accidently put in a high buy order by accident (always caught it after though).
It can happen... Probably not but... Here's to hoping.
But ya, were gonna take a dive soon.

Agreed, reading a book on TA (Technical Analysis) as we speak. I am not claiming ignorance. Breakout trading isn't an end all be all. However, that said for newbies it could be a decent strategy to save them some headaches. I don't claim to be some guru, I just thought it might be helpfull to other people (hence the disclaimer I put back in my original statement)


Quite possibly. However, this seems to be more so for the people who got in it at the very beginning.
For example, Day trading supplies me with my monthly income, I usually pull out a couple hundred 1-2x a month. I tend to buy right before we break through a resistance wall and sell immediately after some gains. Keep my inital investment, take the profit out, rinse - repeat (**Edit**: Thought I should add in, I only go in on a trade after a certain amount of touches to the resistance wall or support wall, Yes fake outs have fucked me before but not as much as they prob should have, count that as being lucky). Worked so far and has allowed me to generate some sort of an income.
I do however have some in CS (Cold Storage), like I said prob smarter to do both.


Why you keep X % in CS and trade with the rest... Why cant you do both?
**Edit**: Best luck to you as well bud, Please dont mistake my crassness for hostility, I just felt slightly attacked in the beginning, I can see over time this is not the case. My appologies.
**Edit2**: What hasn't been discussed more is, why it's also better to diversify with other commodities other than BTC to offset losses further.

This. People are too worried, this market is the most natural kind of market. It's self run and self regulated. If we got along on make shift markets that were self run and self regulated for long periods of time I think BTC will also make it just fine.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:28:38


Oh def understood, but I can't deny that I don't know fuck all about TA - Hence the book, I look at the markets and understand them to a point, the more I "research" books, data, and other things I hope to apply that to this market and other markets better.


Fair enough. Sure there are. Could someone come in any second from now and sell of 30k coins? Absolutely I plan for that on a daily basis, especially after the 96k coin theft from Sheep Marketplace, there is in fact a fantastic chance that we will see a huge fucking sell out at any moment. Or it may never come.


Can't really disagree here.


Well, agreed. However, why can't someone buy and hold a partial amount, then day trade there remaining $$? I mean does it not make sense to diversify in case bitcoin DOES go to 0? It would be prudent imo.
hence the diversification across other markets as well. Traditional trading also posits that if part of your asset in your portfolio is outperforming your others, you should in deed sell some of it to balance back your portfolio. 
Buy and hold is great, but with all your money? Scarrrry!!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:12:46

Not Wisdom. Stop Loss orders guys. This is trading 101. Eventually you will need to learn Stop Loss. Right now it's fine because I am fairly certain that we aren't near BTC's approximate value (who knows could be half a mil for a coin, or 2k). We are prob heading for a correction closer to 4-600$ then back up after things cool down.
However, Using stop loss orders in both directions help you LOCK in your profits and minimize losses: 
Read up on it please.
Edit: feel compelled to give an example. I sold my coins at 1137 anticipating a correction (which we are seeing now). I could of held onto my coins since I bought in at 930$, I had a stop loss order in at 870~ or so. So I would only lose a certain percentage if it went all to hell. Now, I also put a stop loss in at 1180 just incase it went back up, so if the price hit that it would buy all my coins for me there buy minimizing my BTC loss. You can do it both ways. However MTGox or any other trading platform that I know of doesnt have this built in. Use  QT Bitcoin Trader for that 
Saves you money and sanity. Trust me
**Edit**: Apparently this needs to be explicitly said. I am not a trading professional, or someone with 10's of years with experience. I am an amateur speculative trader in multiple commodities including digital currencies. Trading can incur significant loss if one is not careful, statements made by me have personally worked out for me in the markets that I have been in. They may not work for everyone, trade at your own risk
