I was riveted when he had sex with that coconut on the far side of the moon. He waited 'till they were on that side so we couldn't watch, which sucked, but still.

Ahhh well, that's next level fashion you see. Bound to hit the streets in '93.

Yeah but can you wear bitcoin earrings or bitcoinc-coated HDMI cables? Gold can be used for lots of things, scientific, industrial, commercial etc. Just sayin'.  A fancy gold necklace is worth more than it's weight. A bitcoin is a bitcoin. You can't make that comparison and say "you can improve bitcoin while gold ... will stay gold" that isn't entirely true.

Is there something really wrong with software wallets? Curious question, because I only hear the push to hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:02:49
But the hornet's nest's was over they're. Whats the porblem.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:58:13
Are the hardware wallets open source?

Ok, and you're a loudmouth with no real answers. Are we done?

You mean like this video? 
You've got to be kidding me if you expect small vendors to figure this out. Look I kind of appreciate you've got a message and want to make sure everyone hears it, but I've got a business to run and at the end of the day not a single one of my clients is going to say "omg you trapped me you sneaky bastard". I still don't know what "trap" they or I am apparently falling into.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:26:32
So that's your answer?

I just sold my Huffy, my N64, and all my pogs. I'm all in baby.

Really dumb question here, but is this strictly a cash-to-coin system, or can you convert your coins and have it spit out cash as well?

I'm a Wednesdaycoin millionaire and all I did was wake up one day.

I do the exact same thing as OP with our business, using Coinbase Commerce is the easiest way (right now) for us to get our clients onboard. Baby steps!

Ok you seem to have a *massive* hardon for this topic, so be helpful and point us in the right direction instead of yelling like a madman.

Are my memories supposed to take 5 minutes to load? I just upgraded to a 33.6 come on

I saw a parking lot in Vancouver that takes WeChat. I didn't even know that was a thing.
