We are talking about a credit card. When you use a credit card you are spending the banks money. A credit card company is allowed to decline charges for whatever they want or even cancel your account.

However they are most likely calculating the risk of someone buying crypto with chases money and then not paying the cc bill.

When you do torrents your ip is visible to everyone else on the torrent.
A company like Disney pays groups to watch popular torrents (lets say star wars). They then record the IP address, figure out what ISP it is, and send a message to the isp (like cox, or comcast, or AT&amp;T) saying on 12/28 at 5pm ip address 37.37.43.43 was downloading star.wars.1978.mkv and here is the proof.
Your ISP then sends you a notice saying hey, stop doing this shit or there will be consequences.
If Disney really wants to get mean they can go to a court and have your ISP turn over your information and sue you directly.

Why would an investor use Bitcoin as a "hedge against the coming crash and inflation"
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:40:25
It always seemed to me if these were profitable the seller would use them instead of selling them.

Scarcity does not equal value

I'd the price drops before they can convert to USD then it does effect them.

They didn't cause bitcoin to crash, its not their fault you invested money you couldn't afford to lose. 
Everyone knew bitcoin was a bubble.

It effectively is the same as taking a 401k loan and going to the casino. Here is the scenerio. OP takes 50k 401k loan. Bitcoin drops value 20% so now he has 40k in bitcoins
OP loses his job, now he has to pay back the money within 30 days. So not only is he unemployed, he has to cash out his bitcoins and come up with another 10grand within 30 days while being unemployed
Here is another scenario. OP Doesn't take loan. Stocks in his 401k go down 20%
OP Loses his job. He doesn't have to worry about paying any money back.

You think someone lending you $200k in bitcoin isn't going to ask the same questions or want collateral?
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:58:31

The market is operating correctly. Its supply and demand. The price dropping does not mean things aren't working correctly.

Except he will then have taxes and penalties on the 401k money he has to take out to pay off the 401k loan.

The real issue is that taking out a 401k loan to invest is a bad idea. Whether that's real estate or bit coin or stocks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:20:10
So you want your unregulated currency to be.... regulated?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:25:34
This is a terrible idea. What happens if you lose your job and bitcoin drops in value. Your loan would be due in 30 days.

I cant remember the last time i got a paper bill that required any more effort than writing a check and putting on a stamp. Everything else is prefilled out. Saying that, ive never had a medical bill that charged a processing fee. Hell, most if you call in to pay they will give you a discount if you ask for it.

If you have a 401k loan and quit or lose your job you have 30 days to pay the loan back. 
The 5 year penalty free period only counts if you keep your existing job.
