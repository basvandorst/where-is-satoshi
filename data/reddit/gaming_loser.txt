If you think that has any bearing on how futures actually work, I think you might be in trouble.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:06:54
No. I have been watching for weeks. Usually the liquidation comes then the price move. It is delayed about 30 seconds, but it is there.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:19:56
The futures contracts. Go here to time the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:39:06
These liquidations front run the drops. Watch it for awhile.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:45:48
Thanks for the condescending attitude. i know what is going on. Been trading on this for weeks. Good luck to you.

This is the same wall pattern I saw a 18500, 17000, 15k. It is someone or a group suppressing the price to accumulate coin. It should be removed by gdax, but they are making fees so what do they care. I believe whomever is behind this wall is the manipulator of BTC. It is probably coinbase itself. 1500 BTC is alot. I just trade around it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:52:00
This is it and I have been saying this for 2 months. We Are going sub 10k by end of week.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:50:58
True. But the are front running the price. Watch.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:32:22
No it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:47:31
Most likely. Could even be Coinbase doing it. Coinbase refuses to acknowledge it. Gdax needs to put in some safeguards. Major trading platforms have safeguards against this kind of manipulation. Gdax seems to look the other way. It's pretty blatant.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:37:16
I think you are missing the 20mil sell wall on gdax at 13k. They can definitely BLOCK the price.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:28:37
It is a whale suppressing the price. Been there since 18k, 17k and 15k. Wish Gdax would remove it. But it is most likely them.

I think it is foolish to hold now. i have called this before. Once the CME got involved with bitcoin, I knew bitcoins days were numbered. Just look at this:  This is big orders shorting bitcoin and their are more and more contracts going for lower and lower amounts. They are gonna short this thing to 0. Bitcoin has to many enemies. Banks, other shit coins, governments, etc. They want it destroyed. Look at all the negative stories. Look at all the tax and regulations being put on it. But the futures are fine. Remember wallstreet fatcats said "we will tame bitcoin". This is what taming looks like folks.
They will put the miners out of business. The exchanges. Regulate it to hell. EVERYTHING. Then hold it all for themselves. No matter the lightning networks or segwits you add. They know they cant go after the IDEA of crypto. But they can make the MARKET around it so toxic, noone wants in.
Now I could be wrong and this goes to 100k in JULY. I think people who think that are looking back with rose colored glasses. I have traded before. I see what is happening. This is an unregulated market. Their are grifters and con men. Their are greedy wallstreet firms and powers that be that want everything for themselves. Please invest cautiously. Their are not many who can wade through a storm like this.

I hope the market eats right through that paywall and fucks that guy on his future bet,
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:33:11
Thanks IRS man. YEah I know. Got em stashed away.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:50:45
I'm not your buddy. Pal.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:08:03
gdax down
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:25:38
I did somewhat the same. I went into a position on Iota and Ripple. Both have done well for me so far.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:17:41
They can be priced in and settled at any date really. From What I have seen in past. Mostly close of business. I have read it would be an end of month thing. Still foggy.
You can see some contracts [here](
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:00:18
I sold at 18.5k and BOUGHT again at 12k. Am I doing it right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:53:32
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:09:13
I would add:
11. Have a plan. One for entering the market. One During. One for exiting. One for best case scenerio. One for worst. Then stick to it!
12. Set a range. Set a range to buy in. Set a range to sell out. Will make your life easier.
13. Step away from the market ticker. It fucks with your brain.
14. Don't listen to anyone else telling you to sell or buy. just stick to your plan.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:14:14
Just go with what you feel. If you had a goal to pay for your education and apartment. Then that is your goal. You are done. You can always invest a little later. Good job btw!

If you look at the 1 month for BTC you can clearly see the correction happening. We peaked on Dec 16th (where I lightened mt btc holdings) We have steadily gone down every since. I don't see this changing anytime soon. Traders and Wallstreet are cashing in their gains for the month. Throw in futures trading and Bcash then you have a recipe for a correction. I wouldnt be surprised if we see 10k again in the next week. But I am buying a little all the way down. It will go up. I feel for the people who put so much in at the highs.
I kept my powder dry when were at 20k. Knew it couldnt keep this. Now I get some cheap BTC. At 14k the real panic selling starts. HODL on to your hats kids. Gonna be a bumpy XMAS.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:52:06
Yeah. Alot of trolls on most Bitcoin boards. They just want to buy low. Best course is have a plan and stick to it. I did and made a good profit. The thing could go to 0 or 1000000. I did well. I aint rich, but I am able to pay a few bills off. I admit I was a short term investor. I wont do anything else until tomorrow night. To risky.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:17:22
Their is some MAJOR fuckery going on.
Last night someone puts a huge sell order on the exchanges and stalls the price. 
Today the fed announced a rate hike and bad mouthed BTC.
Suddenly sell wall was gone and price shot up.
Huge sell off then happened.
Gold rallies.
Many stocks dump.
Really fishy.
EDIT: I guess one has formed "magically" again. This time even with more coins!!!. Please be careful everyone. Something doesnt smell right.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:45:29
I suggest everyone really watch what they do. Something is brewing and I dont like the smell of it. I hope GDAX does something about this. In other exchanges this kind of order would be cancelled outright.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:30:30
Not when they buy up all the coin and then put step down sell walls to suppress the price. This isnt natural, it is manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:22:23
Ethereum may do well. I see it holding. Maybe a slight dip. LTC is the one to watch. I am buying it on the way down as well.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:08:48
Dont forget the CME futures open next week. Then the contracts will close most likely at the end of the month. We aint over yet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:04:54
cboe site is down lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:22:58
This looks like the dip everyone is talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:03:55
Yep. Idiots sold right into them and now they set up sell walls all the way down. This person (or persons) Have been doing this for a few weeks at the same time everyday. The price would be much higher if it wasnt for these kind of whale moves.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:52:23
I bought in at 7600. I sold from 17k to 19k. Made a bunch of money. I am still good all the way to 7600. This is all fun and profit now for me. I just waited until it went over my return on my investment and scraped profits off of that.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:38:32
And this "correction" is eating that trend up. At what point will you admit that maybe this is a reversal? What number? Overall trend lines dont mean shit if things are being manipulated and sentiment is crashing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:38:39
If it breaches 7k it is going to 5k very quickly. If it breaches 5k it is going very close to 0. Been predicting this for weeks. Been in cash and a few "safe" coins. We are watching the death of BTC. Not FUDing. I implore anyone still holding on to think about your position and readjust it accordingly. All the buy walls are crumbling. I just dont see where the support is. I have read at 7k the miners are in trouble. It is going to be bad this week.
