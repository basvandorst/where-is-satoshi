Good thing it can be and was made to be both.

Anyone still waiting for some concrete explanation in this thread?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:47:35
That is the free market dude.

Don't you think they would say the exact same thing?   Why not just increase the block size and then do segwit?
I don't necessarily agree with that but why waste time posting a statement like that.

Worst post of the year?

This is the top comment??   Zero content rambling.

So your saying the people (Bitcoin users) are so fed up with the establishment (Bitcoin core) for not listening to their needs (fast transactions with low fees) that they may be willing to support the "other" option no matter how good or bad that option actually is (Bitcoin unlimited).  
This analogy makes a lot of sense.

Can't anyone put any information on the block chain that they want?  Don't people put their marriage info on the block chain?
So why would anyone care?   I can tell the block chain I'm a billionaire but that doesn't mean it's true.

Worthless post.  Stick to fundamentals is the only advice anyone needs.  Not interested that you "Sold cuz its ATH!"

Hate to break it to you but the current rideshare services have close to zero vetting as well.

Hey I jumped off a bridge.  I broke most of my bones but I didn't die so I guess jumping off of bridges is totally awesome.  Can't wait to do it again.  
I don't know if you don't understand logic or if this post was sarcastic ???

Is keeping bitcoins on Circle a bad idea too?  And how would you cash some of these coins out into USD once you have deleted breadwallet?
@_date: 2015-10-03 19:30:30
Jealous or just always negative?
