I think the main problem is not the language, Bitsquare use Tor hidden service and it's not a good idea to blindly use Onion's in China. The funny thing is if we admit an extreme situation where China make Bitcoin illegal, Bitsquare will probably be one of the very few last chance to buy for Chinese people.
On an other note it would be awesome to see some implementation in Bitsquare allowing local afk Bitcoin exchange with cryptography wizardry protecting privacy and anonymity.

[Check this out]( at least it give you a conceptual view of what a cold storage look like and how to deploy it with the ability to check your balance without involving your private key to be on an online terminal. 
So now i can't urge you enough to give Qubes-os a try, this OS is custom fitted for (but not only) Bitcoin usage.

[Bitsquare]( look to mostly reach your points, it don't mitigate the tax problem since it use bank transfers, but they  decentralized way of doings are interesting.

Maybe use a VNP is a good idea than Tor, I dont recommend you to use free VPN for anonyma &amp; privacy concern but I think its worth have a look to [CryptoStorm]( they have a [free to go]( section for testing.
I don't know if it's your case but if you care about your freedom use OpenSource software &amp; OS :)

The only way to make money with Onecoin is to don't use Onecoin.

I don't know for phone but on computer Qubes-os is from my point of views the best way to go and a game changer for Bitcoin usage.

It's a problem of centralization, online wallet are great target for malicious cracker and state leaders plus some of them need KYC paper shit so if they go down you are not able to recover your Bitcoin and you potentially leak some personal information.
I think your best chance is to use Electrum, you don't need to download the entire blockchain, it's easy to manage &amp; backup. Maybe better use Tor for your university issue.
