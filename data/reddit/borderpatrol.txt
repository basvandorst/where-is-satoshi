Bitcoiners send me tips so they can hold it over my head that I own bitcoins or that I accepted tips or that somehow having a bitcoin invalidates my opions. "If you hate bitcoins so much, then why do you own them? You must believe they have some value". I send them to the bitcoin eater to wash my hands of it. The only reason I collect the tips in the first place is so they don't get refunded back to the sender.  


Correct, I still see no meaningful value in bitcoin. It's a poorly implemented solution in search of a problem that can usually be solved by easier means.
The entire "growth" of bitcoin is attributed to Bitpay and Coinbase. This is their economy, not bitcoin's. Every new story of "Company X accepts bitcoin!" is just another "Coinable/Bitpay has a new customer". The companies still don't recognize bitcoin as a real currency they want to conduct business in, they still want plain ol' fiat. When Bitpay/Coinbase runs out of VC funding, or if they decide to close up, or if Google/Paypal buys then and decides to jack up the rates to be on pay with existing systems, where will the bitcoin economy be? Will it just be the Meze Grills of the world taking bitcoin again? Or when, as some companies have already seen, adding an option to pay with Bitcoin actually **decreases** things like donation amounts due to either customer confusion or the bad connotations of bitcoin, will companies still be willing to lose money by adding a "pay with bitcoin" option?




Bitcoin valuation is based on speculators convincing other speculators that the value will rise. It's a pure pump and dump, akin to a penny stock, and the entire market is completely manipulated. If you can be luck and ride we wave up with the pumpers and jump off before they dump then congrats, you've won the bitcoin lottery.
The Bitcoin market is irrational. It does not behave like a normal market because it isn't a normal market. It's being driven by a handful of people who control mass amounts of coins and things like the "bear whale", where people cheer each other over buying overpriced coins at $300 when the value should have dropped just shows you how ass backwards the bitcoin market is.
Feel free to check this post in 2 years. Other than the price (which shouldn't matter if it's a real currency, right?) there's been no meaningful growth or advancement of bitcoin.

When your card is entered into ApplePay it's stored as an encrypted account number on the phone. It's not uploaded to the cloud. Your CC number is not stored anywhere with Apple, they don't know what your transactions are and every purchase is made using a one time use code. 
It's literally the safest payment method for mobile or online.

I don't own any bitcoins. Any tips redditors gave me have been sent to the bitcoin eater address.
I do not regret making a 30x investment because that probably would not have happened. We had 3 major peaks and bubbles, one at ~$32, one at ~$220 and one at ~$1200. When the first two bubble popped they lost more than 50% of their value in 2 days time. Can you confidently say that you wouldn't have sold during the crash? 
During 2012 the price was pretty much a straight line with no meaningful movement. Would you have held through that entire lull and not called the death of the market?
How about the tens of thousands who have lost all their bitcoins through hacks and scams? Mt. Gox is the obvious one, but there were plenty other exchanges and sites who lost people's money. MyBitcoin.com lost 250k bitcoins, Bitomat.pl was an exchange who's owner deleted everything when he restarted the server, there's tons of people who lost money through online wallets like Brainwallet, through HYIP like Bitcoin Savings and Trust or just plain lost the private keys. Are you confident you would have also avoided all these pitfalls as well?
You can look at a price point on a graph and look at another point and say "gee, I wish I had bought then" but doing so just removed all the risk, which is pretty dumb. I have said previously that I have no problem with people who want to invest in bitcoin as a pure speculative play, one with intense risk involved not just in the market but one with the possibility of just suddenly losing everything with no recourse for recovery. But just saying "buy and hold, you'll always make money" boils it down to something much more simple and something dangerous to try to convince others of.
I wish you luck with your investment and hope it pays off for you, but bitcoin is not going to change the world and you need to understand that you're investing in nothing more than a high risk lottery ticket.

For a car, OK, I might see that. You're talking hundreds of dollars there. The dealership would be retarded to cut into their thin margins that much but whatever.
But let's take the more realistic example of someone like Overstock. Average bitcoiner order is $240. A 2% discount would be $4.80. Decent savings if you're paying in bitcoins. But do you think the average shopper would jump through all the hoops to convert cash to bitcoins to save &gt;$5 on their order? Enough to drive sales offset the discount given to bitcoiners who were going to buy from them anyways because they're the only place to spend them? I doubt it.

Hi, I'm the creator of Buttcoin.org. I had someone contact me a few months ago with interest to purchase the site. The offer was in the 5 figure range. He stated that his interest in the site was to keep it running as "the onion of bitcoin". I of course took the offer because who the fuck would turn that down. We had a signed contract under his daughter's name who would be "running the site". I was to stay on for 6 months and keep writing because I liked to. My co-writer would as well.
The day after the site was transferred the new owner locked me out of my account and edited ONLY the 3 articles I had on BFL. My article on how shitty BFL's rig was had been ranking  for search terms like "butterfly labs review" and "butterfly labs mini rig". I did a little more snooping on the names used the email I was contacted from and I'm 99% certain it was Jeff from BFL. He's since not responded to any emails and Buttcoin is a ghostship at this point, although my co-writer is still putting out interesting content and running the twitter feed.
Also the original articles can be found here:

Merchants aren't dumb. There's no market to grow yet. Offering a discount on bitcoin purchases will not increase sales by any meaningful measure. If you offer a 1% savings for using bitcoin, they're expecting an &gt;1% increase in sales. Since the market is still so small for bitcoin the only benefit for the consumer is that you finally have a place to spend your coins.
There is no leverage for the bitcoiner who wants to spends coins. Offering a 1% (or 2% or 5%) price reduction will not get a non-bitcoiner to convert cash to coins. Accepting bitcoins is a promotion tool for the merchant and not much else.

Yes, that's generally how businesses work. With trust and contracts and lawyers and such, this is nothing new.




The card is photographed one time and then authenticated. The card number is discarded and never stored on the device or in the cloud. An account number is verified with the authentication chip built in with each transaction. You need your fingerprint to authenticate a transaction. It's extremely secure.
Also this isn't android, there really is little to no chance of malware like you're describing on the platform (unless you jailbreak then all bets are off).


I'd argue that strong authentication methods, one-time use card numbers and the ***ability to reverse transactions*** make is much more safer for the user than bitcoin.

I think you overestimate how much of my time shitposting on a blog or a subreddit takes up.
You know how you're browsing reddit and find a cool pic and post it to your Facebook wall? Well instead of posting it to Facebook, I find funny things about Bitcoin and post them to a blog.
I'm not sure why you'd think I'm incapable of serious responses, Buttcoin has had many serious articles. Like when we exposed [Bruce Wagner's shady past]( and quickly because the highest rated post of all time in this sub for over a year.
Buttcoin is a hobby, a small project to amuse myself. Something to do while waiting for code to compile or whatever. It's not my life's goal.

Someone tipped me $5 via changetip. It happened a lot when tipping was big as a way of bitcoiners trying to "get one over" on me, as some sort of "gotcha" that if I cashed it in they would gloat that I had actually recognized that bitcoin held value.
Shit was so complicated to turn into cash I sent it to the bitcoin eater address instead.

@_date: 2011-12-13 20:55:23
I run [Buttcoin]( and started that now-closed thread on Something Awful.
The whole point of Buttcoin and the SA forum thread was to bring out the comedy in bitcoin. The prospect of getting money out of thin air and getting to build "cool gaming rigs" in the process got some really, really, fucked up people into it with no concept or clue what they were doing. Having an anonymous currency brought out the scammers. Having no figurehead brought out the shysters like Bruce Wagner.
Honestly, as was posted in the thread closure, the comedy well had dried up. People scamming other people became an every day occurance and sites were popping up all over the place that were "Just lik X, but bitcoin!" hourly. Bruce Wagner had run off into OWS's arms. We reached peaked comedy with the Bitcointalk Hack, and making fun of a 17-year-old Ayn Rand lover was tiresome and getting a little creepy.
So yes, the thread is done. Bitcoin had it's moment in the spotlight and now the dust has settled and it's just the small currency project it was before. The scammers have moved on to better targets, Bruce Wagner and Atlas are boring, and the "get rich quick" of pump-n-dump and mining rigs is done. As bitcoin moves on, it's time for the thread (and Buttcoin) to move on.
I've never been opposed to the idea of Bitcoin, but man there was some great comedy in the last 9 months or so that just had to be shared.
@_date: 2011-08-31 16:12:44
Bruce had a civil lawsuit filed against him and his company, Bold Funding for taking foreclosed homeowners money and not delivering on promised services. He was ordered to pay nearly $350k. He also has an ongoing lawsuit in NY claiming he owes over $500k in back rent.
He's now the self-appointed figurehead for an anonymous currency.
Someone has use the name "Tod Williams" to hype up Bold Funding on web forums.
"Tom Williams" was behind the MyBitcoin fiasco which resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins.
There may be a connection between MyBitcoins' Tom Williams and convicted fraudster Bruce's shill Tod Williams.

From another forum:
"That is beyond fucked up. 
Theoretical maximums here.
utorrent at it's peak claimed to have  had 100 million users. Even if the average processor was an i5 2500k(it wouldn't be), that's 90 watts per processor for 48kh/s.
That's 7 cents, per user, per month if the computer is normally near idle 24/7. costing each customer $9.72 a month in electricity at 15 cents/kwh.
With 100,000,000 users, that's 4,800,000,000kh/s, 4,800,000 mh/s, 4,800gh/s. 3 times the current hashrate. That would give them 3/4 of the 28,800 litecoins mined per day once the difficulty leveled out, worth $38,880 a day or about $11 million a month, costing their customers $972 million in electricity a month.
Realistically. For every 24 hours 1 million 2500k owning users run that shitware, utorrent makes $2,300 costing the users $324,000."

That is worst analogy I've ever seen. 
People aren't spending Bitcoins, not at the rate a currency should be. The whole bitcointalk forum is people patting themselves on the back for buying Bitcoins and making so much money by sitting on them for the last 6 months. 
Bitcoins have value like gold, or tulips, or pigs have value. But as a medium of currency you're delusional if you think some site that sends pizza is a sign your hobby has arrived.

There's this endless drum beat over and over and over again about how all Bitcoin needs to take off is some awareness. That if only people knew there was an alternative to cash that somehow average people would start using bitcoin.
I know it may be difficult to understand, but most people don't see the point of bitcoin. Why is it better than cash? Why is it so hard to buy anything I need with it? The economy is an insular group of people selling bitcoins to other people. Everything outside it it converting it to cash anyways. There's no growth and awareness isn't the issue, the issue is that Bitcoin is a proof of concept whitepaper that wasn't intended to be used in it's current form and shouting at people about you should "end the fed" wont fix the inherent problems.

I've owned a few "trademarkverb.com" domains over the years and gotten a few trademark infringement notices before. You do not fuck around with that. The trademark holder can levy fines against you for customer confusion and formulate how much business they think they might have lost because of it. The burden of proof is on the domain owner that you have registered the domain "in good faith", meaning you just didn't mean to register the domain and squat on it or flip it a few years later, like you just admitted you've done in a public forum.
You've already got the certified letter so your one final step away from a lawsuit. You're a moron for not wanting to lose the 10 bucks on your shitty domains that your willing to let the company literally dream up their own damages amount to sue you for. You're a complete moron for wanting to take on a multi-billion dollar company who has a whole department who's job it is to find a sue idiots like you.
