I work for IR, so happy to answer any questions you have.
Unfortunately with the way ANZ works, we can't accept deposits from them.  They automatically convert your money to AUD, and then as our bank is an NZD account they will either reject it or convert it back to NZD for you.  Rejection is annoying and can be lengthy, double conversion is usually pretty costly.  It's a bad experience so we generally disallow ANZ deposits.
I would recommend you create a bank account with ASB or BNZ, these bank accounts seem to work fine with us, we have many customers sending money from either of these two.
We can't accept PayPal deposits, it needs to come from a bank account in your name.
Let me know if you have any other questions!

You can use Independent Reserve :)
But as I mentioned in my other message, ANZ don't play nice with NZD transfers. Have a read here:

Just an FYI The\_Hominem is almost certainly talking about the Australian ANZ bank.
Coinjair is an AUD only exchange and PayID is an Australian only banking transfer method.

You don't need any code to sell crypto on our platform.  You will need a code that we email to you if you withdraw your crypto, but that has nothing to do with selling.  Your question is pretty cryptic, feel free to send us a support message using the platform support system if you're having issues.

CAPTCHA isn't to stop money laundering :)

Yes we did!  Feel free to ask any questions and I can try and answer them.

Would recommend you check out [Independent Reserve](
We have 0.5% trading fees, and you can use POLi or Osko for instant AUD deposits.
Let me know if you have any questions!

The reason I suggested them is because they're instant. We also offer EFT which is just a standard bank transfer so can take a day or two to land.
If you're fishing for credit card facilities we don't offer this. You'll be hard pressed to find any Aussie exchanges offering this as the banks have made it very clear they don't want people buying crypto on credit.

Captcha is only on for non AU or NZ countries.
Having said that, we have many international customers using the site without issue.
If you can send an email to support with a screenshot we can look into it.

Yep for small deposits we do charge a fee. Osko is free  $1000 and above, EFT is free $100 and above (so there's actually no fee in your EFT example).
You can't buy crypto without the AUD in your account, so in your example you would only be able to create the buy order the day or two later (at which point the bitcoin price would have either gotten more expensive, gotten cheaper, or stayed the same).
