I can't find where it says the ATM is supposed to be.

I'm surprised there's a even site called 'porn.com.' It's like it's so obvious that it isn't. Counter-obvious? It would be like 'email.com'or 'search.com.'

No. Different words come with different connotations. It's the difference between whore and sex worker. There are also words for race and gender that's meant to offend. Technically same, meant and received differently.

Do I still have to go to Makati to buy Coins?

Sorry. I can't help it.

I thought I was the only one thinking that.

If this was told to me way back when, [I would've felt it like it was wasted bitcoin](

I thought it was going to be "Blame It (on the Alcohol)." The lyrics on this are so forced.

(1) How likely is it for someone to generate someone else's active address if everyone is already using Bitcoin? 
(2) How difficult is it to derive a private key from a public key--if possible at all--considering future increase in computing power or perhaps dedicated ASIC public-to-private key crackers?

I'm imagining a printed QR code with the address and payment amount in it.

The comment has been deleted. What is it about that it needs to be reported?

Dude. You should really try to practice how to write titles.  
If you have to point to multiple links, maybe use self post instead.

Thank you as well for spreading your load all over the place.

Thanks. I got confused by the article a bit. It doesn't actually say the protocol is insecure except for suggesting the thing about collusion of mining majority.

I highly doubt that they could do that right now. Maybe in two weeks...

Are you mining with your fingers?
