MT Gox doesn't matter people will end up trading between each other and when all of those bitcoins disappear the price will continue to rise dramatically due to the finite amount of coins. All mt gox is is a lesson nothing more it has zero effect on the future of bitcoin

Everyone who stores there BTC in an online wallet is stupid they specifically state that's it's better for you to store your coins in your own wallet on your computer rather than letting them sit in an online wallet hosted by a website

Economics in education is based on all things being equal the common Latin phrase being ceteris paribus. Almost everything you ever learn in economics in business can't even be applied in the real world because it's all based on theory not what actually takes place because in reality all things are not equal.

That's just an info graph about bitcoin and fiat money is used a hell of a lot more than bitcoin to procure drugs and bitcoin is just starting out and has grown into a billion dollar market in 5 years I think it's safe to say that paper currency is on its way out along with banks who just take your money and do whatever they want with it. Bitcoin isn't going to fail due to government intervention they will just end up taxing bitcoin like every other form of currency.
