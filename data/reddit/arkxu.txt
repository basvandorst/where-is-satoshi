I don’t disagree the importance of at some level of decentralization of becoming a global ledger(I don’t believe in true decentralization)
I am saying the bigger value the blockchain brings to us is the ownership of digital assets, even without decentralization. 
I believe when people make trade off between performance vs. decentralization, there will be blockchain choose performance and it works well(fits more use cases and brings more value to end user). It is already happening.
There is not only one blockchain called bitcoin and there won’t  be in the future as well.

Agree but block is not equal to loose ownership. When the ‘super majority’ changes, you still get your chance. It’s all about chance. Even bitcoin, you still can get blocked if all the big miners want to do so. 
There is no real decentralization, you still need to trust something at some point of time.

President Xi said China will embrace blockchain technology. The central bank will also issue digital RMB. The cryptocurrency is still in gray area.

Email protocol does not rely on a centralized service to run ( e.g. everyone has own email domain). You can not use super power to shut it down. As long as there are 2 computer , one can send to the other.  It does not mean the decentralized data storage which blockchain brings to us.

Well, the weather forecast is pretty accurate nowadays. Way more accurate than economists.

I read that reply first and then this one. Pretty encouraging ��

I just started a channel a while ago. If you are looking for something dive deep in blockchain technology. you should check it out:

No shitcoin. I only talk about the technology behind. I might want to talk some coin that is not based on POW how that works. 
This should be really tech intensive, no market sharing or coin sharing.

I use a voice recorder when drawing and a mic facing the camera. Their volume and quality are pretty different. I tried to manually adjust but still pretty bad. 
Let me do some research how to improve.
