Hi, we’ve been operating for four years and have little interest in ripping you off for $400, but we can get straight onto your issue. Did you already use the help form at  ?
Just direct message or email help and I will make sure we find the details.
Also we are rolling out four machines in Sydney later this week which are two way and also generally better!

Humans are about to make a come-back. The number you can SMS is on the menu system, and sorry you felt frustrated!

Is it forming the longest chain? No, so rename it

Not really, when you consider how poor some people are. It's good they're getting organised and that's just one way of doing so. OP be proud you're supporting your country and crypto too!

Open or closed source?

Are you technical? I just can't imagine any serious reason not to want it. Enlighten me please

Do Brazilians use these exchanges a lot or tend to transfer to exchanges abroad to do their transactions? Is the sign up and verification process convenient or difficult?

Try a BitRocket ATM

Get back in touch, wrong company obviously ;-)

Well we wanted to partner with them (ABA).  They thought they were too good for it.  They went bust.  You can partner with them if you like ;-)

Hello - Sydney does indeed have three locations - all at convenience stores
* Waterloo (two-way machine) - 6am to midnight
* Sydney CBD (24 hours) - 234 George St
* Sydney Haymarket (24 hours) - 86 Liverpool St
There was one at a cafe in Rosebery but the hours weren't great and staff literally left it unplugged when they wanted to use the blender.
There are two in Melbourne (St Kilda and Kensington) - with another 3 minimum coming
The website is indeed poor and will be overhauled, the main thing for us now is to provide a consistent service especially as demand ramps up.
Hope that helps

Sydney - Waterloo - a BitRocket two-way Bitcoin ATM

We posted this sign after losing many many hours from panicked customers who were experiencing problems with transactions that would otherwise be smooth and instant at our network of BitRocket ATMs.
Blockchain.info Wallet contacted us to ask about this and here are the reasons for posting this sign:
* Delays noticing transactions (incoming) - not just minutes but _hours_
* Low default (hard coded) fees used for sending that are well over a year out of date and cause transactions to be stuck for days or worse - not really something you want when cashing out at an ATM!
* A couple of instances of double-spends _from_ Blockchain Wallets as a payment attempts to be sent but the wallet falls out of sync with itself (or the network) and attempts to spend the same funds immediately after in a second transaction.  This caused days of stress with the sender who insisted we had stolen his coins (cash out at one of our ATMs) - even after the double-spend transaction disappeared from the blockchain explorers out there
 * A user presumably used his wallet password with another service as funds were stolen from it
Hoping this is constructive - there are several great wallets out there - we particularly recommend Airbitz, Mycelium and Jaxx!  What would you recommend for newbies?

What problems would they be?  Those are problems for the industry that got ABA, but we're doing pretty well.

Cash is convenient in many situations. It’s also more private and you don’t need the bank’s approval to use it. You notice this especially when arriving in a foreign country to discover your card doesn’t work.

Or use a bitcoin ATM that doesn't require ID such as

The first bitcoin ATM was one in the BitRocket group - in Melbourne run by Dale.  Then one in Sydney at a cafe.  Australian Bitcoin ATMs (ABA) got in with big news articles in the Sydney Morning Herald claiming to be the first in Australia (possibly because they provided cash out?).  Unfortunately ABA didn't survive, probably for a variety of reasons including the bank 'operation choke-point' everyone suffers from :(
It's been a tough ride with the tech being difficult, tax laws, no help for innovation from the government, banks blocking startups while doing their own blockchain work behind doors, and traders being divided and conquered by all of the above problems.
BitRocket now has seven operating out of a total of 15 - so getting homes in more cities - currently choosing a couple in Western Sydney for a partnership, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Brisbane, two in Perth and three more for Melbourne.

Because delays and limits on exchanges mean your 5% fee won’t matter in a few days. Timing is everything
