Like others say, you have definitely NOT missed out. Here is some food for thought:
As the Bitcoin network grows, it becomes more secure. Therefore, on a risk adjusted basis, your potential return on investment hasn't fallen as much as you may think.
As the price of Bitcoin rises, developers and other network supporters who hold Bitcoin become financially free, and can contribute more of their time to the project, thereby increasing it's potential value.
A fantastic return on mainstream investments like companies or real estate is 20% annually. Bitcoin is obviously leagues beyond that.

You attack a straw man. There is no way the Fed could have prevented zealous tycoons from buying into the housing bubble. At most the Fed could have made a public statement to discourage people from buying in, but those wrapped up in the housing bubble would have given zero fucks.

In times of intense systemic risk (like 2008) the Fed Reserve needs to be able to act swiftly. "Audit the Fed" bills tie Fed decision making to Capitol Hill and would slow critical moves to the speed of a contentious bill in Congress.
Fiat isn't BTC, and in it's world, the economic stability is more important than transparency. Seriously. This is why we should all hope for a smooth transition from fiat to BTC. Keep the economic stability, and gain the transparency of BTC.

The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was mostly repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. Many people presume that if the Glass-Steagall Act had been in effect, the burst of the housing bubble would not have damaged the rest of the economy as badly.

Merchant does not need to have a channel open with the customer. There just needs to be some path from customer to merchant that is no more than 20 nodes long. 20 may sound like a small number but its actually plenty (insert graph theory). Some nodes may become very well connected but that does not risk centralization. Such a node could threaten to go offline or charge high fees, but it's EXTREMELY unlikely that you could not find a path to your merchant through different nodes given the 20 node ceiling. Why is it unlikely? Because every individual node has strong incentive to be well connected.

You've got it backwards. Those 10 million bitcoin would be representing 19 million bitcoin worth of value, but there's still only 21 million bitcoin. So the "market cap" of bitcoin is inflated, and could fall back down, but no holder was ever diluted. If you own 1 Bitcoin, you still own one 21 millionth of bitcoin's total value, with or without fractional reserve.

When BlockFi lends you crypto they give the bitcoin to you with an on-chain transaction. The blockchain prevents double spending as normal, so there is no rehypothecation.

The liquidation preference of your deposits is favored to most other capital at Blockfi, so your risk is pretty limited. Definitely less risk than a corporate bond. However they just revised the interest rate to be 6% only for the first $100k in deposit, 2% thereafter, so it's not nearly as moonworthy.

Bitcoin transaction fees are cheaper than interchange fees.
Edit: I'm guessing the downvote is from someone concerned about the factual accuracy of my statement. That's valid, but I'll give the typical response: lightning.
But I do think savings on interchange fees is the only pitch relevant to merchants. Merchants are profit motivated. There can be no expectation that merchants care at all about decentralization or sovereignty.

What's your use case? Right now some coins are better than others for particular applications. Pick the right coin for the job. If you are just looking for an investment vehicle, choose Bitcoin, because it appears to be the coin most likely to be used as a store of value.

@_date: 2019-08-27 20:09:33
In practice this will never be the case, and that's a result of bitcoin's design. Bitcoin mining is destined to be the most competitive industry of all by having the fewest barriers to entry. Therefore non-mining needs for energy will always outbid miners for the energy. I.e. bitcoin is only mined with energy that would not otherwise be used.

Wow, no, not at all implying that all positions in finance were gained without merit. The point I was trying to make is that in the current system, the closer you are to the central banks the more power you have. Not so in bitcoin where a respected core developer doesn't really have any economic advantage over others.
I put a lot of blame for the military industrial complex on this aspect of having more power as you get closer to the central banks. There would be fewer wars if the people that wanted the wars had to pay for them. Instead they pay basically nothing relative to everyone else, and they probably aren't the ones offering their lives either.

BTCPay Server. They are integrating lightning as possible, so you can be sure that you are on the cutting edge. Regarding your question on fees/practicality for a sub $1 txn per user, it can be cost effective to do on chain if you pay most all your users in batched txns that happen a few times per day. That way the fee is a smaller portion of the value to/from your user base.

Actually no, that's still not what I mean, and to be clear, there is no energy "spread among the supply of coins". The energy spent on mining is simply the barrier that must be overcome to double spend coins. It is in no way related to whether any of those coins were spent to a valid address or spent to an invalid address (aka destroyed).
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:52:15

Well about 85% of rewards have been issued. That's public info. But I imagine you are looking for a metric more like Nic Carter's realized capitalization.
You can certainly try to measure that, but what counts as "in the market's supply" has no objective definition. You would have to make your own definition like: has moved from the address that received from the coinbase and has moved at least once in the last year.
I think you have the right curiosity tho. Institutions buying OTC are buying straight from a miner or one trade away. When the reward halves these buyers are going to have to buy from the public market.

You are conflating medium of exchange with method of payment. Something can become a money even if nobody uses it for common transactions. The only requirement is to gain mindshare in the idea space of what goods could potentially be useful for indirect exchange.

It takes wrong side of the risk asymmetry. People are long bitcoin because there is a small chance of extreme gains, but max losses are what you put in. To short bitcoin is to take the opposite, which is to likely have modest gains, but a small chance of extreme losses. If you are trying to build wealth from nothing, good strategy is to be high risk until you hit your payout, and then never risk so much that you would be back to where you started.

@_date: 2019-04-04 18:39:26
It is not needed now. What is needed now is a strong expectation from network participants that the block size will not increase, and that if fees are too high for your use case you need to figure out how to compress your transactions. If we subsidize weak tech with a block size increase the network will never mature.

The critical part of this is to find business owners that want to talk to you. For the sake of bitcoin's reputation please don't cold canvas.
I'd think it useful to have a community where people call out businesses that might be well suited to bitcoin. Then have a peer review or voting system to build a case for the merchant until before long you've actually got a solid, tailored pitch, which any person could then try to deliver. Needs an incentive tho unless karma is just that sweet.

When people say "full node" they mean a node that keeps a full copy of the mempool and validates every transaction. Such a node does not have to mine and would still be considered a full node. As for the point of running a node and whether or not your node contributes to the network, I direct you back to my first comment in this post where I replied to OP.

Your crypto is collateral. If you retain control of the private keys the loan isn't backed by anything, which means blockfi is trusting you to pay them back. You could do a multisig wallet with a third arbitrator, but that's still trust based, albeit diffused among more parties.

belcher_ is asking you to look to your own node (istead of a third party service like wallet hosts or blockstream.info) when waiting to see whether or not your transactions have confirmed.
That's what actually makes the network decentralized: economic value that trusts nobody. If you aren't making any transactions your node isn't really helping the network, other than making it marginally easier for other nodes to find peers.
Similarly for lightning, if you don't stake a significant amount of value in your node it's not helping the network (obligatory don't be reckless in lightning's early days).
All that said, having one more person is this world that knows how to set up a node is great! We appreciate your efforts.

Not the guy you were replying to, but I can explain what people are looking for.
1) Do your TA
2) Define a trading strategy based on that TA. (Going off your chart, such a strategy might be something like: when price crosses above your line sell everything, when price falls below your line, buy back all in.)
3) Measure the performance of that strategy as applied to a period of time that was not a part of your original TA. 
4) If the strategy outperforms a simple HODL over the same time frame there is likely some merit to your TA.
All you've done here is step 1, which is useless on its own.

You show people a successful strategy based on your model to give evidence that your model is true. Your chart alone does not prove that "we are stepping back into an healthy historic exponential law".
It's also great to tie in other fields like population growth as you've nodded to, but still, your chart does not at all prove that Bitcoin behaves similarly to other things that grow exponentially.

I appreciate the art. I'm criticizing your ability to price your products. If you sold anything for more than the price at this 50% off point that's lucky. I myself could buy one of the pieces right now, relist it at the 100% price, and just hope someone buys it from me. That's dumb. Hope is not a strategy.

Value of the BTC you spent minus the value when you originally bought it, all multiplied by the tax rate (probably 15%).

It's a terrible piece, but at least is a nice example of how NOT to educate on crypto.

The piece should instead aim to communicate the benefits of cryptos, such as being permissionless to use, independently verifiable, and resistant to attack due to decentralization.

Market forces determine BTC transaction fees. If someone pays a $4 fee on a $7 transaction that must mean they find the bitcoin network extremely useful, so useful that they were content to pay 50% fee. If you don't find the network so useful, then you don't make a transaction. Block space is limited, so if there are a lot of people that get better use out of a transaction than you do, they're going to out bid you. All you can do is try to squeeze more use out of your transactions.

In general the value comes from disintermediation. For example, fiat is sent as remittance often with a high fee. If bitcoin can do the same at a lower fee, people use bitcoin instead. If so, the value of the remittance facilitating company is captured in bitcoin.
Now here's the interesting part. If you do even the most basic napkin math on industries Bitcoin could reasonably capture, the price you'll get is well above the current price. So you know know that you want to get into bitcoin, and yet the price is volatile so you want to buy in at the bottom of a swell.
That's super difficult, so honestly I don't think about it too much. I just buy small amounts at high prices and progressively more at lower prices. Then just HODL till Bitcoin has gobbled up everything under the sun or you reach your personal moon.

Nice quiz, thanks for sharing. My thoughts:

4. I'm curious what you think the answer to this is. Some might say a wallet, others would say the blockchain itself.
8. Fantastic question. Has an immediate answer, but much more depth as you unpack the why.
Basic questions:
10. I'd actually specify three kinds of forks. Natural hard forks (orphaned blocks), intentional hard forks (consensus changes), and soft forks.
Not much more to say. You did really well with the basic questions.

You totally missed my point. If you prioritize human success, NOT whaling is the best strategy.

Don't update it, just trash the whole thing. The fact that the column for lightning has rows with NA value shows that a side by side comparison is not appropriate.

OP is not asking for privacy tips. OP is questioning whether or not privacy improving proposals compromise our ability to verify consensus.

I'm not concerned about price manipulation. Bitcoin's design gives fundamental properties that convince me of it's survival. I wouldn't say I like allowing anyone to control the price, but that's an obvious statement to make anyway. To be specific, as a person living in the US, I think the existing laws and enforcement are not working well, but are working just well enough that society can carry on. That's the most I hope for really, since it's enough for ideas like Bitcoin to spread.
I have few complaints about the banking industry as a whole. Sure it's a honey pot for the most malicious people to pursue, but that's a flaw of centralization in general. Bitcoin will disintermediate many industries.

At that point it comes to: prove yourself or the government fines you. For the government that would be: prove yourself or we impeach you.

A third party couldn't do it on their own, but corporation A could prove to a third party that they paid corporation B because they have something that nobody else does: the private key.
For more on zero knowledge proofs I recommend videos from Computerphile.

10th anniversary of bitcoin. By the way, your post should be a comment in the daily discussion thread, not a standalone post.

As for "instant on leasing", I think OP just means being able to get the thing you are leasing quickly because you put up your bitcoin as collateral.

The answer you are looking for is in zero knowledge proofs. With the right code it will be possible to prove that your transaction follows consensus without revealing anything about the transaction.
Regarding you question on auditing institutions, similar answer. With the right code it is possible to prove solvency without revealing anything else.

Whales as a species have accrued a unique and deep knowledge/skillset via evolution. Studying whales benefits scientific discovery, and so far we barely understand how deep that knowledge goes, or how useful it may be. When facing uncertainty like that, it is best to be conservative. The conservative approach is to preserve species at least until we've learned everything there is to know about whales. The "libtard" approach is to assume we already know everything about whales, and that the most useful thing they can provide to us are their corpses.

/s? I have a hard time imagining that hunting whales is more productive than alternatives if you account for negative externalities. I dgaf about sob stories either, but I think reasonable economics suggests not taking out whales.

A hardware wallet with open source firmware addresses this concern. OS of the computer you plug it into does not matter at that point, it's still your keys your coin.

What about these implies scams? Sure they can be used as buzzwords by people trying to promote Ethereum, but you and I both know scammers gonna scam.
These are real financial tools that can be developed in a robust way. To ignore them is the same as ignoring bitcoin just because people have fallen for BitConnect.

You overestimate market makers' ability to coordinate. They all want return, but they all differ in perspective and strategy. The resulting price movement is chaotic. Seemingly stable equilibria can change at any moment. Valuing bitcoin requires seeing through the chop and distilling the main ideas.
