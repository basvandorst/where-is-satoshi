Better than silence, I'd argue.

Ok. So, low fees gamble that it may never be sent. This makes sense. Thanks, it was pretty unclear, even after I had read the text at the bottom.

So should people who invest in anything. Investments are chances at profit, paired with chances at loss.

From their website.
No, but I'd bet there are other exchanges with much nicer rates than 7%. 7% is practically robbery. 
A quick google shows that Kraken, Bitfinex and Bitflyer all work in japan and have fees below 0.5%

Maybe. We'll see.

I know you mean well, but I'm more worried about the people out there.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:26:45
That's really high for where I am. I dont know if its different in Japan, but from America I bought on GDAX for 0.25% fees. Typically less than 0.5% if you buy from a good exchange.

To the moon?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:33
Thats euros.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:48:02
Probably Kraken. Requires ID verification though, so it's not as convenient as others may be. Still, probably the best rates you can get. Also, transferring money in takes a while, so it's not a quick transation if thats what you're looking for. Often places with higher fees are willing to deliver faster.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:43:04
So, if I set the fees to 5 sat/byte, I dont see it ever reaching the top of the list. Does this mean that the transaction will never occur practically?

For a complete idiot, how do we read this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:13:27
That's such an open ended question that nobody on earth can answer that. Like, a doctorate in Economics might help ya understand it a bit more, but even then, you cant "know". 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:08
Are you sure about that?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:53:37
I don't think it's really much safer. Well, it's safer for them.
