I think Satoshi will never cash out because if so everybody would know his identity. If coins are moved from early 2009 everyone would know that these coins belong to Satoshi. And this would mess up his/her/its hole "hidden identity" thing. So probably the very early coins will never ever be spend. But he sure has enough bitcoins from the time when more people started mining, these coins would be save to spend without revealing his true identity.

What you are thinking of is called a fork in the open source community, it's not stealing. Anyone can fork a project and implement things on their own if the licence allows it. In the end the free market decides which implementation to run, not the developers.  
Segwit gets activated when 95% on the network agrees with it, not if Core agrees with it.  
Bigger Blocks happen when a majority of people on the network agree with it, not if BU pushes for it.   
Bitcoin simply put is just a bunch of rules an overall majority of people agree with. In order to change a rule you need the majority of the network to agree with it, not the devs. The developers can lay out the path Bitcoin should take but in the end the users and miners are the one to decide which direction Bitcoin takes. If the devs lose touch with the majority of people they lose their legitimacy, not the other way around.

You do realize that what you just said goes fundamentally against the main Bitcoin ideology? If core or any other Bitcoin implementation rejects Blocks from other Nodes they disagree with you are eliminating the decentralization of the Bitcoin development process. It's like saying we should ban all parties in a democracy except the one who currently holds power.  
You can disagree with a lot on both sides, BU and Core. But silence one of them because it goes against you believes kills the fundamental ideology of a democracy and Bitcoin.

It's more like double that now that the price is at 1800. Take 260 satoshi per byte with an average transaction size of 226 Byte results in a fee of 0.00058760 BTC equivalent to about 1$. Sure it's still nothing if you transfer 1000$ to cold storage but you might not want to use it as a daily driver to buy coffee or something.
