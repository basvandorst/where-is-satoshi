This is not true. Progammers aren't entirely in charge of the specifications on OpenBazaar. The core team is made up of a wide range of skills, not just coding and all of our opinions, plus opinions from the community go into making product decisions. 
We made a decision to focus on the tech/bitcoin crowd first as our early adopter audience. Bitcoin and OpenBazaar aren't ready for the mainstream yet, but we have plans to bridge the gap into the mainstream in the future.

We publicly announced that v1 would be focused on individual sellers and very small vendors. Medium to large sized vendors need a much larger feature set that we knew would put the release date much further out. Be patient, these features will come in time.

Great feedback, thank you.
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:20:20
I agree. 
The real underlying problem is we don't know how fast bitcoin adoption is going to scale. We simply don't know, so each proposal is a hypothesis on where we think the market size will be on 2, 4 or 8 years. 
If a bitcoin application with a similar growth curve as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc comes online in 2016, we may very quickly blow though a 2mb 4mb or 8mb cap within a year. This silly proposal with 1mb increase per year does not take any of this into consideration and is more geared towards proposing something that miners will accept. 
We're not planning for the unknown and it's really going to catch us off guard. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:30:33
Yes, game changer. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:01:56
What would you change?
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:07:43
Haha completely agree. My guess is end of January. We have a clear picture of what is left to finish and now we just need to pump through it all. In the meantime, for anyone that is excited about OpenBazaar, please install the github repos and help us test as we're building out the last few remaining features. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:37:09
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:06:05
I feel like we're just throwing darts with these proposals now. We have no idea how fast transactions are going to increase in 1, 2 or 5 years. There are many new applications coming online next year and if one takes off it could lead to hundreds of thousands of additional transactions per day pretty quickly. A 1mb increase per year isn't going to do much to help.

I was tired of not having an interface to view all of my cold storage wallets at once, so I spent a few days hacking one together. If you're like me, you have bitcoins spread across multiple wallets and you find it difficult to keep track of all of them individually.
I kept it super simple — just enter a couple public keys and you'll have a beautiful interface for them in a few seconds. There's no need to register or provide any personal information or any bs like that. It's simply an awesome interface to keep you updated on multiple wallets in one screen.
There's other cool use cases for it too. One example, here's the five highest valued bitcoin wallets grouped together:
It's definitely still buggy and still very much an mvp, so let me know if you run into anything strange or have any suggestions after playing around with it.

When people say "Bitcoin killer app" they're primarily referring to a well adopted application built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. We can all agree that Bitcoin is game changing technology in itself, but we're going to need some additional use cases to spike mainstream consumer demand.

As a seller, there's no need to ditch eBay so soon while OB is in the early stage. Posting on both platforms could be beneficial in the short to mid term to maximize your exposure. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 23:07:16
Discovery is a difficult problem to solve and we're spending a lot of time thinking about it. Will OB make advertising obsolete? Probably not, but we should be able to build tools that help store owners promote their stores more easily and make word of mouth growth easier.

It really depends on a lot of factors. If you don't have access to a bank account / CC there is tons of incentive to use OB. Or if you're under 18 you can buy stuff without asking your parents for their CC. Those are two massive audiences.
@_date: 2016-01-07 23:12:13
Stores can customize their page how they choose, that's a color palette I chose for my page, which I think would work well with my target audience. 
A lot of the small shops that sell via Instagram go with bold colors on their ecommerce sites too and do very good business, we're talking a hundred thousand customers or more. Sure, not mainstream big, but OpenBazaar is going after small shops to start.
Here's a few random instagram shops that do well  
  
  
  
Steam is also incredibly popular with gamers and uses a non traditional template. Same with the Playstation online marketplace, they use a blue template and have 100million users. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:42:11
That's incorrect. People can add a ride sharing listing to their store (tag the item with  keyword) set their location and ANYONE could crawl that keyword across a region and drop all of the available rides on a map. It's basically just a query at that point. Give me all available (rides, airbnb style rentals, meals or whatever) within x miles of my location.

[Great comment explaining what OpenBazaar may become](
"Interesting. This isn't just a decentralized marketplace, there seems to be something bigger going on. If you look closely at the screenshots, you will see there seems to be a social integration within it too. Notice there is the ability to follow stores. I'd imagine that would mean there will be a feed to consume all the new items and content from the stores you're following too. This isn't going to be the application you pop in to buy something once a month with Bitcoin, it's going to be a social platform with commerce layered in that you visit every day.
This seems like what every artist, social media star, author, photographer, musician, etc needs. Build a strong following, post an update of a new song, content or anything and people can pay to play/read it right away. New types of pay to read blogs will likely start to emerge in the market. New social media stars will emerge by creating edgy stores where people can pay them to do/draw/write/sing/play/cook/photograph/wear/eat certain things. A new social channel will come to life and the content and stores will be like something we've never seen on the internet before. It's going to be very very interesting people.
This is huge!"

Hi all,
I'm the designer behind the prototype. I just wanted to say that the design and experience of OpenBazaar is still very much a work in progress and the prototype is also still very buggy. Overall, it should give you an idea on where things are heading, though.
I'll continue to update the Github link daily, so please feel free to follow along, and make sure to join us on our slack channel. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:20:08
It's a terrible user experience to not have anything localized to your region. For example, seeing prices in btc isn't very helpful to the average person, but seeing them in your local currency is. 
If people are accessing OpenBazaar via a VPN and eventually Tor, we can't rely on getting the information from their ip to determine their location, currency and timezone. 
We're building something much different than a standard website, so please keep an open mind to some of the hoops we'll need to jump through to deliver a localized experience to users. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:12:57

Hi all, Design lead from OpenBazaar here. 
Thanks for the feedback. I agree that an onboarding process can sometimes feel tedious and unnecessary, but there is a balance here that you need to consider. This is a global market. There will be nodes from all around the world that you connect to. Some will be selling NSFW items and some will be selling things you have zero interest in or maybe even have items in different languages. 
My job as a designer is to think through the first time experience and optimize it for you out of the gate so that you're not presented with a collection of items that are irrelevant to you or maybe even offensive to you. Having prices in your local currency is hugely helpful too instead of having to do the bitcoin conversion to *your local currency* in your head.
Think about a new computer or new phone first time setup. You're first hit with a series of configuration questions, and sure it would be great to not have to do any of that and just use your new phone, but Steve Jobs put that stuff in there for a reason, to optimize your experience with the device. Making something personal keeps you engaged in using the product and simplifies your experience down stream. 
I agree that asking bitcoin address is probably premature to ask during the first time setup and I'll consider removing it and ask it during a transaction. 
Most of these questions are optional too, so you could skip over them if you wanted to save 60 seconds. Sure, that again may feel tedious, but I'd rather give people the opportunity to configure their experience right out of the gate instead of just dumping them into something that is completely unpersonalized and have them try to figure it out on their own or manually have to go into settings and override the default settings. 
Again, there is a balance that needs to be considered here and I think the positives of optionally filling out a few basic configuration questions outweigh the negatives.

**How is it better?**
**The average eCommerce store:**
* Shopify / Magento / Bigcommerce platform (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed)
* Payment processing via Stripe Integration / Braintree Integration (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed)
* Must have a bank account (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed)
* Need to reach your entire audience? Use something like Mail Chimp or Constant contact (includes: fees; pay more as your subscriber count increases, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed)
* Need to chat live with your customers? Install something like Olark (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed) 
* No bank account or credit card? Sorry, go open an account first.
* Under 18? Sorry, come back in a few years.
* Target audience unbanked? Sorry, can't serve them.
* Setup difficulty: Advanced (some technical advice/support likely needed to piece everything together)
* Setup time: Days
* Cost: $50+ month for beginner stores plus recurring transaction fees
* Privacy strength: Non existent (private conversations exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed, customer identity exposed, emails exposed)
* Audience: Banked adults
* Attract new customers: Paid search 
VS 
**The standard OpenBazaar store:**
* eCommerce abilities built in for free
* Payment processing built in for free
* Banking capabilities (wallet) built in for free (eventually)
* Reach your entire audience built in for free (reach unlimited followers, no fees)
* Live encrypted chat built in for free
* No credit card or bank? Perfect
* Under 18? Welcome
* Target audience unbanked? Perfect
* Setup difficulty: Easy 
* Setup time: 60 seconds
* Cost: Free
* Privacy strength: Medium (conversations encrypted, chat messages encrypted, customer identity not exposed, revenues are private)
* Audience: Anyone in the world
* Attract new customers: from the built in marketplace and through the social features integrated into the application (free)
OpenBazaar wont be as feature rich as something like Magento right out of the gate, but the foundation is much better and the core feature offering should catch up over time.

Also, based on your logic, innovation would never take place because the initial audiences are too small to cause any type of movement. You fail to realize that all major technical advancements start with small communities of passionate individuals, which eventually spirals into parabolic growth.

Check out this application called Instagram. They managed to build an impressive audience by wrapping the photo experience into a social network. It should have never worked though because cameras were already integrated into phones and people already had social networks, yet it still did. The same thing will eventually happen with ecommerce. You can continue to pick apart all the individual features of OpenBazaar and point out where they already exist in other services, but you're missing the point. OpenBazaar wraps commerce and social into one, has privacy built in and it's damn easy to use.

I think you're underestimating how difficult it is to take market share from a product that is already working well. See Windows phones for example. There would need to be a significant advantage to convince people to switch over to a new coin.
Bitcoin already has a lot going for it: a strong community, a 4 year head start and plenty of organic marketing behind it. I'd love to see some of the big boys come out with their own coin, I think it would only result in positive press around the legitimacy of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-25 13:43:04
Not everyone in the world could buy a Ford from day one. You're comparing massive distribution problems in car manufacturing to essential zero distribution problems in Bitcoin. 
The simple fact is Bitcoin is in the driver seat right now and there's no immediate concerns to that changing any time soon. There could be a better alternative to hit the market in 10, 50 or 100 years from now, but for the time being, Bitcoin is the most recognized crypto currency and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.
