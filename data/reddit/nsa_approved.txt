I have an extra laptop running Linux (plain Debian) that I don't really use for anything and I plan on using that for storing my wallet. In that case I'd only connect the laptop to Internet when I'm updating the blockchain or making a transaction.
How safe would that be? I guess a minimal Debian installation already makes it somewhat more secure (I don't use any of the major desktops, just plain Openbox) and if I only connect the laptop to the net when I actually need to, I should be pretty safe, I hope?
Edit: naturally I'd need backup copies of the wallet, but I can easily encrypt them once I just figure out which encryption algorithm/software to use. The paranoid in me doesn't want to use any officially enforced standard, such as AES, but rather go with plain Rijndael with non-standard block size, but I guess the chance of anyone cracking AES is quite small to begin with...

I set a mental limit at 750 and I would have bought at that price, but my Bitstamp account still isn't verified :(. (And the local market I've used a few times until now works so slow that with my luck it would be back at 1000 before my order is processed).

Not yet, but there are various things I'm considering to buy, since BTC is so convenient when purchasing abroad from places that . When I'm purchasing locally, I don't really see any reason to use BTC, since the banking services are so convenient and safe.
(I hear a lot of people complaining about banks here, but I guess that depends on where you live?)
Edit: oh, and perhaps it doesn't count as a "purchase", but Bitcoin is absolutely awesome for tips and donations. It's so simple to just copy-paste the Bitcoin address from a web page, enter a sum and **bam**, it's done: no need to deal with Paypal or anything like that. I wish more people accepted BTC as donations.

Before that it would be nice to see some changes in the way BTC is taxed, particularly when mined. I don't know how this works in other countries, but here (Finland) BTC **trading** works pretty much the same as trading with any other currency (any money you gain in the exchange should be reported as capital gains and will be taxed as such).
**Mining** on the other hand is just nuts: you're supposed to report it in taxes as regular income according to the exchange rate at the moment when you receive the Bitcoins. Naturally this is a problem, because there is not just single exchange rate, and if you mine 24/7, you might receive small payments throughout the day and you're supposed to track every one of them and the exchange rate at the moment when you received them.
As the saying goes: "ain't nobody got time for that."
Another problem with this is the changing exchange rate: if you mine 1000€ worth of BTC, you're supposed to pay taxes for the full 1000€, even if you don't cash them immediately and the exchange rate falls later, so that you get only, say, 500€ when you actually exchange them to "real money". (Or, it could be the opposite, like in my case: when I mined my coins they were basically worth nothing, but thanks to the huge climb in the exchange rates, I just cashed them today for over 400€).

Another significant factor is the media attention. Bitcoin is still very much a niche thing (ask anyone on the street about Bitcoin and they probably have not heard about it) and any attention it gets in mainstream media is going to have an effect on the exchange rates.

Bitstamp is getting there. I think the "wall" at $1000 was over 6000 BTC when I checked it several hours ago and now it's under 3500 BTC.
That's still more than $3M, but if people keep buying at this rate...

I wouldn't really have any use for this, as I keep things pretty clean and the only thing that really needs cleaning at my apartment are the piles of notes, print-outs, books, etc. that I'm always "working on", and I don't think that they could help me organize that mess.
But it would be awesome to try this just as an experience: "aw yiss! I have hot maids cleaning up my place."

Okay, thanks! I'll put this on my reading list.

There's a [chart]( of this at bitcoinrichlist.com, but it's a bit dated (no date, but the total number of BTC is given as ~11.4M, so that's quite a while ago).
The list of [top 100]( is up to date, though, and it's a bit scary to think that just 100 addresses hold over 20% of all BTC ever generated.

Do I need to read *Saturn's Blood* before this? Anyway, there's no paperback available (yet?). I'm not a bitcoin millionaire and hardcovers are a bit expensive :(

Mining. I just got back into Bitcoin after two years of not really following the scene and I'm glad I saved my wallet from back then: the 0.76 BTC I mined was worth almost nothing back then, but now it seems that I'm getting an early Christmas present of over 400€.
Don't really know what to do with Bitcoin after this. Mining is not really worth it, but if there's a crash in the near future, I might spend some of the money I made from Bitcoin as an investment.
Considering that there's only something like 12M Bitcoin in circulation at the moment, the value of Bitcoins could still go up enormously, if people really start using them.

That's okay. It's available as an ebook for a more wallet friendly price and I might as well use this opportunity to buy my first ebook -- I've read plenty of books from Project Gutenberg and other places, but I just realized that I've never actually tried buying an ebook.
Thanks for the offer, though. :)

Isn't the point having hot girls putter around your house "cleaning"? That's what I was getting at: there's no use in having anyone else clean my place, but having one (actually just one wouldn't be enough; need at least two to make it really awesome) of these hotties pretending to clean up would be a great experience.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:20:26
Yes. I'm almost certain I've seen a similar picture regarding the good ol' stock market.
Actually, scratch that: it's the exactly [same picture]( I have no idea about the original source, but I'm quite sure that this is years old.
Ninja edit: I found [this]( dating it back at least to 1997.
Okay, the source seems to be the Baltimore Sun from [1989]( Not a surprising [date]( for such a comic.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:21:15
I don't. The techies around me already know about it and there would be little reason to try to explain it to anyone else at the moment.

Or he just wants the rate to drop, so he can buy cheap and then wait for the rate to rise again.

I started with BTC when it hit $30 around June 2011. Sure, there was mania among the Bitcoin sites and even some media attention, but not nearly as much as there has been now.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:45:21
Someone just cashed in a large amount of BTC, which caused the price to drop suddenly, which in turn led to people buying at the lower price and the price bounced back almost immediately. The random ups and downs after that are probably caused by people who panicked at the sudden flash crash.

[blockchain.info]( has an estimate on how much money moves through the major exchanges. For most of this month the daily volume has been over $10M and it peaked at $80M on 19th. Before that there were several days of over $30M volume in April-May. The total for 2013 is just over $2 billion.
This doesn't include trades that don't go through exchanges and I have no idea how much those would add to this.

Just a guess, but this might have something to do with Satoshi being Japanese. In Japanese [large numbers]( are expressed as powers of 10'000, unlike in English (and other Western languages) where powers of thousand are used instead (thousand, million, billion, trillion, etc.).
100 million in Japanese is exactly one 'oku'.

26 BTC? That's pretty expensive for something you stuff up your twat...

Don't you have any simpler exchanges in your country? I can trade small amounts of BTC to/from euros by just filling in a short form and then sending the money. No registration needed or anything of the sort and the only downside is that it's a bit slow (orders are processed twice a day and orders above 2 BTC/500 EUR may take some extra time).
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:50:13
I do that too. Does it mean I'm also at fault here? :(

There are several, but the first I came across was [NinjaStik]( You can buy a USB-stick with the software pre-installed, or you can use the [DIY instructions]( to do it yourself (not much detail on that page, though; you'll have to setup the encryption and such yourself).
