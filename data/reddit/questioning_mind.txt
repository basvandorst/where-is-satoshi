It’s a biological imperative for surviving that infants recognize/look for parental figures.  They cannot survive on their own (until they become teenagers and know all...lol), so nature built that need into our DNA.
Projecting that need (indeed, nurturing it in children) onto others as you get older simply because nobody REALLY knows what happens after death is disingenuous to me.
Why am I calling you out? Claims of peace if we follow your way without asking questions to a potential creator:
“Worship a rock for all I care, just don’t throw it at me”.  Well...there’s been a lot of rock throwing over the best entity’s dogma (Dogma is the main issue I have with most religions).  Entities that cannot be observed/empirically measured.  And don’t throw in the whole  “but my religion is peaceful”.  Most of the major ones certainly are not, especially the Abrahamic ones (Christianity, Jewish, Islam).  For every cherry picked verse a person can pick out, there is a fucked up verse in the same manuscript.  Laws exist now in developed countries that dissuade most violence via risk of jail.  But it wasn’t that way before by any means.  Another of your posts suggests that we should lie down and accept this being’s judgement no matter what.  That line of reasoning is the ultimate expression of needing a father figure to determine right from wrong (control) and/or deal my with the uncertainty of what’s after death.
TLDR: I believe we are biological machines.  You believe in a mysterious being that we’ve never even detected and attribute human like characteristics to it.
