No, this article is a sensationalist piece of junk.

Bitcoin still has physical elements, it, in some part, exists in the physical world. So, theoretically yes, governments could shutdown Bitcoin by controlling or destroying the physical elements.
I just don't understand the thinking in this sub sometimes. There are people and entities that have an enormous amount of power in this space and it's like people want to pretend that's not a thing or that Bitcoin is like some kind of metaphysical economic device that's going to transcend economic realities.
Unfortunately, we don't live in a libertarian utopia where everyone can live in unbridled freedom all paid for via Bitcoin; we live on Earth where powerful people are in control because the masses are too complacent believing some dumb technolibertarian fantasy co-opted by the rich and their psycophants is going to save them.
Instead of parroting these bullshit talking points and buying Bitcoin, apply for a passport, save your money, invest in an index fund, go out to volunteer for a good cause, and protest.

The U.S. government doesn't literally control the value of the dollar, people acting on behalf of the government pull different financial levers in the hope that in conjunction with the market the dollar will have some value relative to goods available for sale.
This concept that somehow Bitcoin is completely detached from economies and is better than the dollar because of that is delusional. There are market forces and politics at play in the Bitcoin market too. If a market as large as the U.S. collapsed there's no way the Bitcoin market would not feel that.

I think "ripped" is a bit of an overstatement

hmm yea, maybe they're buying the machines based on the shares purchased? Good point though.

Yea correlation is not causation, but this is a trend that is worth exploring still because this makes intuitive sense.

Okay, yea I see that now in the terms and conditions section, thanks for pointing that out
