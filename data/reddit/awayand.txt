how exactly are regulations going to keep exchanges from getting hacked?

if less people use bitcoin and jump to altcoins, the fees will drop, thus bitcoin becoming more interesting again. supply and demand. Bitcoin's fees are that high *because* it is so successful.

works as designed. the system will regulate itself according to supply and demand. different blockchains will have different transaction fees. maybe you shouldn't use bitcoin for micropayments, there are lots of other alternatives, I won't name any as I would be biased.

one wallet can have thousands of addresses.

yep but that would be because the password was weak. spreading out to more than one wallet won't fix that

yea but there is some plausible deniability that it is not you who spent that money if there is one hop in between...

Supply and demand, baby. I find it hilarious that everyone is complaining about the exorbitant fees yet still using bitcoin.

sounds awefully familiar... Where have I heard of such a situation before, someone help me out
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:56:35
pretty sure you did. the 8% vat is priced into bitcoins, read the faqs carefully...
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:34:21
the faq clearly states sales tax is figured into the price
