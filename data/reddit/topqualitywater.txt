Your perception of something does not change the actual definition of what “new” means.
To be fair with you, I understand it well enough to not be obsessed with it anymore, and that was awhile ago. 
You, on the other hand, talk like you think you know. It’s obvious what the truth is though.

I’m a little confused how, on one hand, he can say crypto isn’t money, and then on the other hand, says that if Libra wants to become a cryptocurrency, they must become a regulated bank.
I thought you just said Cryptocurrency is not money, and based on thin air? 
What, are you saying that in order to create money out of thin air, you have to become a bank? 
Hmm... ��

It’s 10 years old, and there’s literally thousands of crypto’s now. It’s not new.

I think the decentralized aspect is merely for censorship resistance and reduced potential of manipulation. It’s possible you might be conflating decentralization, with PoW consensus, which while different, I still completely agree with you.
Bitcoin is not a wise currency to adopt because of this fact, the biggest miners and earliest adopters control the distribution, and that allows them to have massive control over value of Bitcoin.
Maybe 20 years from now it’s value will stabilize... maybe.
Maybe by then something better would come along.
It’s an interesting *experiment*

Pretty sure it’s for price suppression.
I’d imagine that in new ATH it also acts as rocket-fuel. Could be wrong.

Yeah I’m aware, guess it irks me because I’m more into breaking through, rather than pussy-footing with it. 
It’s not really a party drug, but people try so as to be able to say “yeah man I do dmt all the time, it’s alright” - if it’s just alright, you’re not nearly doing it the right away, and that’s not worthy of respect to me.
Like fr, why would you waste such an expensive drug on threshold doses, like if you’re trying to have fun, just drop acid.

I’m so confident in bitcoin that I didn’t even flinch when it dropped, why? 
Because it’s got so much potential, holding is the only real safe bet.


@_date: 2019-06-25 13:10:06
Buddy do you even hear the shit that’s you’re saying?
1. I never said it has no use.
2. Bitcoin is being used more than any other crypto solely because of first mover advantage, not because it is the best choice, smart people tend to move to smarter choices.
3. Less fortunate people could use any crypto, *if they had the infrastructure.* Look at Dash in South America, *and Venezuela.* 
Heres a link if you are too lazy. 
You make it sound like bitcoin is the only option. Smarten up, clearly it’s not.
Bitcoin is not the one and only, and if you think it is, you are ignoring the reality, you are being *delusional*
Hah, and it’s *my* ignorance thats showing..? 
Stop putting words in my mouth, and grow a brain, because your entire argument is mute.

While I agree they can potentially create money out of thin air and drive the price up, no one has to stop-loss with USDT.
Say they were taken down, I could still stop-loss my bitcoin through USDC and call it a day. Of course this will crash bitcoin, but that’s going to happen in an irrational unregulated market.
It can make smart people rich, and stupid people broke.
And to people who say “well that’s creating money out of thin air!”
Well, what do you think is going on with traditional fiat?
Sure, fiat is backed *mostly* by assets, to a degree, but so is tether; pick your poison, or don’t choose Tether. Simple.
Crypto; be your own bank.

If something is self-fulfilling, doesn’t that mean it achieves its function?
TA works because rich people follow it, stupid people follow by FOMO, and even richer people go against the status quo, just to fuck with people and make money off the other rich people.
TA works, it works at being a cruel joke though.

No, seriously, I want to do this without linking a bank account

I mean, if all you’re doing in your spare time is getting fucked up off one of the most powerful and spiritual drugs mankind has ever known, then yes, of course shits gonna get fucked up; your abusing the shit. That goes for any drug abuse, it’s gonna do shit to you.
Besides, when you do a real dose, strong enough to break through, you kind of realize for a brief moment “oh fuck! wtf did I just do! Jesus effing Christ!” and when you come back you come to accept that it’s not a toy. It’s not like coke, it’s not even like 10 tabs of acid, this is something different, you really don’t fuck around with this shit; and to people who try to, I don’t respect that, abusing dmt for fun is seriously stupid.

Fundamental analysis.
Learning how something operates and achieves something, who’s involved, it’s goals and ambitions.. 
It’s essentially getting an intimate understanding of something;
Technical analysis is essentially “I see a wedge shape on the charts, and this tells me the market is about to drop, bEcAuSe pAtTeRnS”
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:59:16
Yes and psychology is the failed attempt at defining human behaviours...
Wait a sec...
Bottomline they both are capable of achieving definition, so long as the fundamentals are understood. 
Markets and human behaviour, you will never define them without fundamental examination. 
Case closed.

You guys think you understand something, but you don’t. A lot of you seem to repeating the same things as everyone else, without much second thought.

Banks like to think that as long as it’s in their account, it’s their money until you decide to withdraw or spend it.
Truthfully it’s like a slap in the face to the banks. You are using their infrastructure to purchase things inherently designed to weaken their infrastructure.
If you can get away with buying with prepaid credit cards somehow I would do that.

By the time bitcoin is a couple million dollars a piece, most fiat will be hyper-inflating. Supposedly.
So by the time the global standards start hyper-inflating everything will be measured in satoshis. Dollar value will start to become meaningless
