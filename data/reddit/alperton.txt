if you panic you lose, if you think you had enough sell and leave or just hold. both ways welcome to the ride.

Pukka Pad this must be in UK :D whats the pizza on the left and from where :D

Yeap that's exactly what I use, in worst case scenario your transfer takes up to 6 hours but mostly within hour coinbase receives the money but that one hour can be really crucial sometimes so always keep money in.

Try Dave he recovered my wallet within a day.

Good point I actually didn't, I knew it's pizza Hut but wanted to know what pizza it is, the one on the left looks great and had exact same hour ago and tastes divine :)

Yes open euro account in Revolut first then deposit  some money in Revolut, exchange that money into euros and then transfer it to coinbase. Coinbase will give you all transfer details and it has to be euro they no longer accept pound so make sure all your transfers between Revolut and coinbase is euro or you will lose some in commissions plus this is personal preference put that money in gdax from coinbase that belongs to coinbase and there will no fee at all.

nope totally made an amateur move and didn't test it, its a paper wallet used bitaddress.org used copay breadwallet and their own encryption tool it all says incorrect password 
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:46:47
yeap its protected with BIP38 from bitaddress.org and I have the passphrase itself. Is it something I can crack with clues?
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:44:55
its paper wallet from bitaddress.org i dont think they have support at all.

Thank you for all the responses, after a week of trying every possible combination left with a wallet I cannot touch, so as many advised I decided to use  and messaged Dave, I hope he can decrypt and return the amount after his cut. Will update if he manages to brute force it. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:12:58
So my wallet is decrypted thanks to Dave, after a week trying everything I decided to use   and emailed Dave. I handed everything to him, passwords, wallet details, coin amount, how much it worth and etc., within 24 hours he emailed me back saying "Good news!". It was a huge stress to lose password and then giving your private key and all possible password combinations to a stranger hoping he will return the amount after his cut. After he cracked my wallet and sent me my passphrase I never felt so stupid it was just one digit missing, there was no typo, but on the other hand, I would never guess that one digit, not even in million years. I am so thankful to him. Hope no one needs his service but if you cant recover your wallet he is the only one you can trust. He could easily steal my coins and disappear but Dave is doing this professionally and he is trustworthy, trying to build a good reputation.

I guess it was waiting us, like a last drop

I also like the design and usability of Copay, plus supports Touch ID all other wallets literally secure as my FarmVille game after you unlocked the phone for general use anyone can open the app. But on the other hand people says it may not support BIP 148 if chain split happens.

same got more at £1600 already made some profit. if I see going down will sell and buy more at the lowest

Since its decentralized it's vulnerable to fluctuations can't really prevent it without centralizing and put under control, this is the nature of it, it's risky, one day takes to the moon other day journey to center of the earth 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:38:10
great buying option then...hope that happens 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:46:30
coinbase gives no shit they just shut their service down so they can buy coins when it's cheaper and preventing people buy at the cheapest. plus their support service does not exist at all. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:53:42
I am also in the same boat but just watching hoping it will bounce back if you are so worried means you invested more than you should
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:50:47
And that is the same question I am looking for an answer every where :( 
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:41:15
Buy some coins and try to sell or buy it back at surge, good luck
