Everyone is provided the right to have representation in any type of legal matter.  Each case is of course unique in regards to the circumstances and issues at hand.  No 2 cases are the same and what is worth fighting for can only be determined on an individual basis.  The most important thing is that everyone has the ability to have their rights put forth on their behalf.

I think generally speaking an attorney doesn't concern him or herself with setting precedent or the chance of an appeal.  If counsel did that they would perhaps loose sight of their objective which would be to represent their clients to the fullest extent of the law.  That ethical obligation should be the only concern for the attorney, not they potential fall out one way or the other afterwards.

They haven't disclosed that at this point

Hacking is illegal regardless of the nature of what someone may be trying to acquire.  As far as ownership, the key issue is and individual claiming ownership of the Bitcoins in order to alleged that they had been stolen or in terms of the government seized. I believe it would clearly be considered an asset, obviously the main differences right now as compared to stock, bonds or actual liquid currency is that it's not regulated by a governing body and can be acquired and held without a specific identity being connected to it.  
Consider if individuals only transacted in cash that was kept within their own personal belongings as opposed to banks.  It would be much more difficult to keep track of commerce as a whole as well of course who actually owned what amounts.  One could argue that Bitcoins are a much more extreme version of that of course on a much smaller scale.

i am not involved in the Ross Ulbricht case

If the action was illegal in the United States then the government would be able to take action based upon the act regardless of the country of origin of the offender

obviously won't be giving out private details of any case I'm working on, should have said AMAA
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:37:54
we don't know specifically yet, but they have a liquidation process they normally go through for other seized assets
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:15:02
definitely holding

I cannot speak to any issues specifically to Silk Road or any other sites alleged to pertain to criminal activity as I do not work for the government.  I can say in my opinion the sites are being monitored by the federal government on a consistent basis.
The seizure process for all assets is going to be the same whether it be liquid assets, stocks, property, etc.
I have no idea how the FBI does internal investigations regarding specific Bitcoins users and do not want to mislead anyone by speculating

If individuals who were identified or chose to be identified from a seizure they could try and attempt to file a claim.  However, it would be prudent to know and understand the justification of the government seizure before going down that road.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:06:04
it's a fine line...

No government agency can sell any property or assets seized until they are determined to be legally in the possession of the government. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:38:44
The government uses warrants to discover information they don't have access on.  This would be true in any type of criminal case.  The warrants just have to be valid.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:15:19
Can't disclose that. Sorry
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:27:21
I am not sure about protection under the 1st amendment.  Essentially if valid warrants served in order to determine identity or track transactions that would be unrelated to any protection under freedom if expression.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:21:44
If a seizure occurs and it is invalid the individual has the ability to contest it in court.
But talk to an attorney before claiming anything. You need to know the ramifications of revealing yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:22:03
sorry, but we can't talk about details of the case at this point
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:44:17
If activity is conducted within the US that is illegal then anyone involved is subject to criminal prosecution within the US.  The fact that he activity is legal in their home country is irrelevant.

A chain of custody for computer intel wouldn't be any different regardless of what it the item was.

While we won't be talking specifics on my case, for other bitcoin/law related updates you can check out my new blog 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:04:04
currently no law exists in the United States related to "miners".  I think it's probable that legislation could be forth coming from a regulation stand point
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:41:23
Yes, we have been accepting since August, shortly after the case started, and actually received our first payment this week!

I think over the next 12 months you will see further development in both securing Bitcoins as well as regulation across the world.  The quicker the variable issues surrounding Bitcoins are defined the you will start to see a more stabilized market
