It’s just another confirmation bias/denial. Whatever makes people more comfortable with themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:42:27
I would say the transaction fees are the main threat right now 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:20:40
Because hodlers and speculators are in much bigger numbers compared to reasonable people and real bitcoin/blockchain enthusiasts. Accurate indeed 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:27:07
Im aware of it, but I’m still confused about what is holding it back, though 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:05:17
No fees is out of question. There is no such thing as “free” in this world. But it can’t be too high either 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:02:24
Yeah people who doesn’t understand every single detail about bitcoin. Wow , what a shame. How dare people not know stuff? You sir must be an enlightened person, I should eager to be as wise as you. Please share your immense intelligence with us, humble newbies. 
And by the way, pay 1$ and your transaction  will come back to you right away with a midle finger in it.

If you think about it, it’s harder to get a working and all setup credit card to use, and yet people feel like they need to understand crypto in order to use it, despite not the same with fed money or credit card ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:46:10
It is theft. But they have more guns and policemen to enforce it
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:27:06
If you are new to bitcoin and are thinking about buying now, don’t do it based on the “veterans” advise. There is a high probability that they only want more people to buy so the price goes up again for them to cash out. Be always careful and avoid biased comments
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:20:24
If only the question asked about “an investment asset” or mentioned “pure speculation” 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:24:50
I agree, the fed is criminal. Creating money should be illegal because it is a fraud, literally. I was actually criticizing the government. They can create money, but alongside with inflation. That’s why I think bitcoin is marvelous. But this gold rush really annoys me. It made small transactions unusable and it’s so expensive that just a minority wants to still use it as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:13:42
“SOMEONE IS FORKING BITCOIN, WHERE IS GOVERNMENT TO REGULATE IT?” 
People are not ready for real freedom. And true freedom means there should not be such thing as intelectual property. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:11:42
Yeah forget about using it as a CURRENCY. Who needs to actually put it to use anyway. 
Hodlers are ruining bitcoin, that’s what is happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:00:02
Are you lacking arguments? You know that if you have nothing to say you can just ignore stuff, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:55:30
SOME people (most of the newcomers)
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:14:52
Currency to be used in transactions? Surely is not bitcoin. Unless the transactions involves goods over a thousand dollars, it’s just not worth it anymore. Thank you speculators for ruining bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:42:51
Isn’t Futures exactly what caused the biggest bubbles we have ever seen? Wasn’t future contract that led the biggest financial crisis in history? Why are you celebrating this bulcrap? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:28:34
What if it dropped to one penny? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:46:28
Why is this good? Futures contracts played a big role in the worst bubbles and  crisis humanity has ever seen. Why is this good news? Unless you don’t care about people losing money so you can profit from them of course... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:53:52
Me too. I’m here because of taxes and something evil called fiduciary currency. Governments have been printing like crazy and there are some nuts even debating universal basic income, like wtf... free money?
But this btc gold rush is destroying the original purpose of bitcoin , it’s impossible to use BTC right now for small transactions. And despite all alerts and advices people still only see the promises of high returns 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:34
It’s not about scam. Bitcoin is public domain, therefore there is nothing wrong with bitcoin cash. And I will tell you this: Bitcoin is the WORST cryprocurrency out there right now, completely useless outside this bubble. As a CURRENCY, it’s unusable due to the extremely high fees and slow transactions. Most of you are angry at bcash because it is better and you are afraid that as soon as people realize that, they will adhere and bitcoin value will drop and the sovereignty of bitcoin is ruined as well as your investments in it. 
So the community has to take actions into making bitcoin great again and stop this investment madness. Let’s remember bitcoin is a currency and it has to be usable in the real world otherwise it’s completely pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:17:44
Well, millennials are not going to achieve anything if they keep treating crypto as mere investments for easy money. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:12:10
And I’m not even criticizing the Bitcoin, which I’m a huge fan. The difference is that I will never sell my bitcoins. I want it to disrupt the states. I want it to be used as a non inflationary currency. But this ponzi-like tendency is killing its usability 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:12:01
How can a bitcoin be lost if copies of the ledger are distributed worldwide? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:46:28
Or it’s because the competition is better than bitcoin as a CURRENCY, which has become unusable due to the whole hodl, high transaction fees, and a very slow transaction time. And people are starting to realize bitcoin can’t be used to buy stuff anymore (except, of course, things above 500 dollars), otherwise using dollar or other crypto is more convenient. 
Your post is just a rage of a shareholder at the competition because you invested in bitcoin and you are about to lose some money if it bcash take its place at the top. Understandable. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:51
Cheque? I’m thinking about upgrading from money not downgrading. Did you miss interpretation classes? I’m not criticizing bitcoin. I’m questioning this madness of buying bitcoin as an investment only. This is ruining  the currency
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:48:24
Bitcoin is unusable as a currency anymore. This is what I keep saying here. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:02:01
I disagree. The graph is the main indicator of price because most of the people in bitcoin now are speculating. I don’t believe many people are interested in the potential of btc to be used as a currency. Most of the people are ready to sell at any moment so the graph is what they have to speculate with. 
I believe in the technology behind bitcoin that why I will never sell mine. But the price will always be defined by those who don’t (those who will sell). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:39:23
No can do. I’m too poor. I ended up here only because I was trying to avoid taxation.  
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:20:59
You are absolutely right. Only fanboys will down vote you. It's true, the mindset needs to change 
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:26:27
Minimum wage  is a threshold for unskilled, if you can't produce that value, you can't be hired because you are not worth it for the company. Then you will be unemployed forever. The real minimum wage will always be zero no matter what policies you make

I hold my head and scream "NO" internally every time I see liberals pushing socialism in the United States. They should come to South America and see the mess this actually is.
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:01:08
Lol does anyone really believe bitcoin will overthrow the banking system? How naive 
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:52:07
Realy? Damn. 1.60 USD would be 0.145 worth an hour of a job at McDonald's in Chicago (minimal wage). Where I live a popular can of soda like Dr pepper costs around 0.6 worth of one hour at McDonald's job. Same job, 4+ times more expensive. I envy you. Third world countries suck 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:12:22
I see. But there are similarities and this is concerning... 
Anyway, besides from the contractual obligations  stuff, how,structurally, is it so different from pyramids? 
@_date: 2019-03-14 04:55:00
Me too. A car passed by me once and dumped a bucket of coins right in front of me. Me, a kid then, picked them up to play. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:28:26
Murray Rothbard? 
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:04:28
For the same reason they didn't stop bitcoin yet: they don't REALLY want to. Because none of these is a real threat to their monopoly of power and violence.  
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:20:45
Damn I wish I could understand this 
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:15:54
Thanks! It makes more sense now. Still... Why are these smaller blocks not being fully processed (dropping to zero)? If so much of that big block got processed, why not the others, that are considerably smaller? Maybe y axis is not the size of the block as I'm thinking, but that is what is implied since the line goes up as transactions are added... 
And why are there some green lines (higher fees) staying queued as purple ones (cheaper) get processed (therefore "cutting in line")? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:03:55
That is why I said it will not likely cease to exist. But it can be stopped or made viable no longer 
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:37:07
"Unstoppable" is a strong word. Sure bitcoin wouldn't cease to exist unless all the ledger in all computers was completely erased, but the State, owner of the army, trillions of dollars and owner of our very lives (no, you are not free), wanted to prevent bitcoin from ever being traded again, I believe they would be able to.  The State is that powerful. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:31:06
To be fair, this report is not all wrong. Some aspects are true like expensive transactions, energy usage and volatility. Doesn't  mean they are afraid or feel threatened. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:01:02
Government agents in general are evil. Even though many of then never realize or has no intention of being. They still do harm just by allowing government to operate.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:53:41
The drop happened right after the Google video  on quantum supremacy. That goes to show how people who are "into crypto" are ignorant about actual encryption.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:40:18
Why is this getting downvotes? Did I hurt your feelings? Do you feel that insecure? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:55:41
That’s just terrible. So if bitcoin reached 1 million, it would be impossible to buy a coffee with it. It already is, actually. That literally inutilizes its use as a currency 
@_date: 2019-02-19 07:03:07
If mass adoption happens they won’t have a choice 
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:33:46
It's not a Spoiler, stop being so sensitive. 
Words have meaning. A "Spoiler" should spoil something. It's not meant to be "any image or scene whatsoever from a movie". 
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:13:14
That's true for YouTube video titles and thumbnails too 
@_date: 2019-01-02 03:58:23
What’s wrong with you 
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:21:28
Now that's rare. Bitcoins actually being used :o
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:25:49
That's actually a lot for something so small and irrelevant in quantity (bitcoin transactions) compared to the others. If bitcoin was used as much as other types of money, what would it be like?
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:46:08
Cars? Of course not. Those are not even comparable. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 03:42:27
Could have been something more readily available in everyone’s keyboards like ś or š . I don’t know how to type this symbol without copy/paste or using specific softwares 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:01:33
We are prone to believe in what is utterly convenient to ourselves 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:28:56
You are not all wrong. But I’m afraid bitcoin fans are already blinded by their idealism or by bad faith, they will not hear you. Although most of them realize by now bitcoin is a trap, they don’t care because the more people falls in, the more value spikes, more money they get. 
If I create something to be a chair and everyone uses it as a table, it is a table. We all know bitcoin is not a currency, it’s an investment because that’s how people treat it. Therefore, we only win if people buy it more and more. That’s why everyone looks at the prices IN DOLLARS every single minute. They want to know when to pull out. Very few people really believe in bitcoin as a solution to centralized bank and the FRAUD of fiat and FED by now that’s is unfortunate but true. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:13:29
Well well, Looks like we still don’t need government regulation or centralization after all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2019-05-05 06:04:54
Why companies kneel before this inexpressive minority that is the sjws is something I still have to figure out.
@_date: 2019-05-05 06:11:20
Supposedly, people who support bitcoin for its raison d’être and are not here for day trade or to get rich should value freedom above all else. Even for these morons
@_date: 2019-05-05 07:00:03
I’m not talking about Milo, I’m from Brazil I have no idea what this guy says or does. I’m saying in general: Companies bending over to Sjw happens everywhere often for some stupid tripe. For example, sometimes a two digit number of tweets are enough to generate an absurd amount of backlash because some journalist decided to write a story using that dozen of negative comments to stir up some revolt. It’s clear to me that the majority of people don’t give a shit though, why would a company aim for the minority (with the least money)?
