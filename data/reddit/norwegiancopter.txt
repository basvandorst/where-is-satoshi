And you can´t do that I presume...

100% this. The exchanges are weak links. But, how can fiat flow into bitcoins without them? At this point, very few of us can mine for coins.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:34:10
Not exactly. mt.gox seem to be the most reliable exchange at the moment, and you´ll have to do a wire transfer (there are a few options, but visa, paypal and mastercard are not one of them). Unfortunately it will take some time, but I don´t see this stopping even at 500$. There are currently 20 000 people waiting in line to get verified. Think about it, if each and everyone of them are adding 100$ to the pool, or even a thousand in average...

Talk about getting late to the game. Everything I can afford to invest is on its way to Japan now. Guess I´ll continue to be a slave to the banks :P
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:09:45
The verification process is necessary only if you plan to deposit more than 50k$, and if you intend to withdraw back into USD. As an unregistered user you can still deposit less than 50k$, but the week-to-week sum you can withdraw will also be smaller. You can also just buy the coins, transfer them to your digital wallet, back it up on a harddrive and keep it in your safe for holding. After you own the coins you don´t really have to use mt-gox anymore if you do not intend to actively trade BTC/USD. Hope that helps.

In a scenario where btc really do "take over", what do you think the short and long term consequences would be? Do you see Governments toppled? Good thing I am a gun owner as well :P
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:51:55
Sure, I´ll give it a go. I was waaaay too late for the game anyway. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:12:48
It doesn´t necessarily need to crash. It seems to me more like a commodity than an actual currency now. People use it to hedge against fiat, and rightly so.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:26:05
I´ll get back to you in a year.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:20:36
I tend to agree, but no one knows for sure. Thousands of speculators tre throwing themselves into the game daily and are driving the price up, but 1 btc could store an insane amount of money with only the trust that we ourselves are putting into it. 1000$v 3000$ 10 000$ Why not? 
However, before that time, i think certain governments are gonna get fed up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:13:00
I was planning to buy guns. Nope. Not yet.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:03:05
People haven´t caught up yet. Adoption rate is still low, but the media around the world is picking up on this... I just hope more vendors will start accepting btc.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:42:31
Same. Got fund in this morning and just placed my order @ 200
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:31:02
I know. Hard to see the direct consequences right now, but wealth would basically be transferred to the younger generations mainly. Industry as we know it would still go on, and there would be massive room for growth, and most of those working in the banking sector would probably have to find something else to do... I´m just speculating, but the results of this could be massive, or it would all end in a final bust as bitcoins crash to the ground. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:50:23
In my mind, the technology itself is a commodity more than a currency at the moment. The more people getting on, the more the coin is worth (sounds like a pyramid schme so far right?) but the currency thus gets more attention and becomes more real. Despite small quirks, like mtgox, the technology itself has the potential to bring modern fiat currencies to its knees. Like bittorrent and MPAA/RIAA.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:23:17
Du kan bruke wiretransfer hos mtgox. Fungerer fint det. Tok 3 dager å få det inn på konto. Jeg har mer penger på vei akkuratt nå.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:17:07
I am a little concerned when the major tax evaders are getting involved... 20000$ pr BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:34:06
Seems to be a little turbulence whenever it is about to cross a psychological threshold..
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:56:43
Is there any way to measure attrition in the btc-system? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:50:26
I disagree on the notion that it is not built upon anything. Sure, it is not gold, or anything solid, but neither is fiat currency. The mathematics it is built upon are given the stamp of absolute trust if we choose to do so, and it would not be wrong of us to do so.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:16:24
Ask me again after the ddos attack stops. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:22:11
Why not? Look, there are 30 trillions in tax havens at the moment, what do you think would happen if they startet pouring money into bitcoins? You know, an anonymous (as you make it) way to hide assets? When the big cats want into the game, bitcoins starts becoming legit for real.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:35:58
I tend to agree, but I am still kicking myself. The more I learn about this technology, the more I´m thinking we might see some sort of revolution...
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:14:25
Suicide :P
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:43:53
Assuming he sold everything in one order he still can.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:11:45
Agreed. The past few days its value as a currency has been, well, worthless. 
I bought in rather high but I followed rule number 1, and I´m buying more @ low.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:56:34
I don´t see any reason why btc could not act as a deposit because of its very nature. I realize they dont have vaults of cash on the Caymans, but I would guess a lot of digital currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:28:28
This technology could be a real threat to the established system imho, and there is no way to see the consequences yet.
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:05:13
It is not fictional. Kauri sea shells was used once upon a time.
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:27:39
Thank you for that insightful comment. It was truly helpful to everyone here..
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:58:13
Its psudoanonymous nature and its potential for storing money for those who doesn´t want it taxed makes it into a commodity more than a currency as of now. Sure, it is speculation fueled, but it is a technology with potential. There is hardly any difference between bitcoins and pennystocks, or any other high risk product who is pretty much rigged from the beginning anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:06:35
I´m just curious as to when the tax evaders are getting on the bandwagon. THAT would be interesting.
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:51:49
If you use tor or a simple vpn for your transactions, then it is secure. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:15:01
It is not weapons grade if it is depleted. If that was the case, the iraqis could just gather bullets and sell to North Korea :P
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:00:10
I understand you don´t know the technology, and didn´t buy in early :) 
If you don´t believe in in, don´t buy into it. That simple.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:00:01
Let me get this straight:
Bank account (Fiat)--&gt; Mtgox (wallet)--&gt; Paypal--&gt; Purchase something. Instead of:
Bank account (Fiat)--&gt; Paypal account--&gt; Purchase something.
I fail to see the benefit.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:06:48
Thank you. I just hope we´ll see amazon or any of the big online retailers start adopting it reasonably soon. Adoption by retailers is critical.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:27:40
The more you learn about this system, and the system we already live in, the more I start suspecting we might see an actual revolution. The way I see it, invest now, and potentially come out ahead of the curve.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:14:07
And I agree. It COULD be a bubble, but it COULD also be the currency of tomorrow. In which case, 200$ a coin in severely undervalued. Anyway, as a tool to avoid tax, the system is a commodity in itself, and there are 30 trillion USD in various tax havens around the world.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:46:46
Probably a pilot.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:25:34
It´ll be back up pretty soon. Fucking ddosers...
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:27:30
Few. But the fact that people are waking up is what driving the price now.  I would bet on 1000 within the month. We might see a correction at some point, but not yet. Also, when people realize this as a tax haven for real, then we´ll see even more gain. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:10:17
One thing not mentioned in Europe as a whole as well as the possibility of hiding massive assets, who may drive the price up.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:42:24
Amazon or anyone reputable. But you are right, and I might becoming a chicken/egg paradox. BTC can be a commodity or a currency, but having it be both might mean trouble although I don´t see the consequence yet.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:56:29
I don´t want to be the one ruining your economy, but if you can afford to lose those 3k, I would recommend so yes. 
Hell. De-centralized filsharing cannot be stopped. It has been a revolution for sharing of content. De-centralized currency like bitcoin cannot by design be stopped. We might as well look at another revolution, but this time of even greater impact than just file sharing. 
I had a few coins from when it cost next to nothing, but I have recently invested 2,5k$, så that makes my portfolio about 3k as well.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:37
Most of us, yeah, I think so. Those with the most coins are those who spent the least, så it is still going to be a pricey commodity.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:50:17
I would drink to that!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:24:24
What makes this machine so expensive? Isn´t it just a box with GPUs?
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:44:04
Perthaps you should do as that other guy who wanted to promote his btc lottery game, by giving away btcs and ask them to spend on your site. You´ll increase liquidity and you´ll gain traffic. Just my two cents.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:42:25
There are 14+20 000 people queuing up at mtgox for verification. The supply is gonna dry up, and prices will rise. Especially when the big guys are gonna start hiding their fortunes in btc.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:56:54
Unfortunately I´m not rich, but this is a worthy goal indeed! Try not to encourage cyberbegging. Upvote!
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:15:48
True, but who can say those early adopters are more ethical? 
Also, I wasn´t just talking about the fat cats, but those with illegal assets. They may be more inclined to just let it stay.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:21:45
Quite fine. Bought more @ 65... If they break 100, I break even :)
I have time and money :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:46:34
Common sense proves it. I´m just curious as to how the market will react if this indeed becomes THE currency, and people wanting to use it as a tax haven.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:20:35
I bought for 2000 USD when the price was 220, then I bought for 1500 when the price was 60. First I felt like an idiot. Now I just broke a small profit. Moral of the story. Don´t spend what you cannot lose, and don´t panic ;)
If you are in this for the long run, I would not be worried about buying @ 150.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:10:25
Since when was Paypal (or Western Union) better for transactions? They take like 6% fee or something thereabout.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:43:19
But what happens when tax evaders find out how this little tool actually works? Don´t you think the big players want a piece of the cake? Not to mention, the file inside of the cake?
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:02:17
I had to force reboot. After that BitcoinQT kept on crashing after seeing the splash-screen. What I did was to delete the last two blocks and let it reindex and redownload the last blocks who I figured was corrupt. Worked out fine. I´m in sync and nothing was lost. Remember to keep an offline wallet.dat backup.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:22:17
Have him transfer money to YOUR bank account, and they YOU transfer to YOUR mtgox account. Once in your offline wallet, you can do whatever you want with it. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:36:43
To be fair. Bitcoin is trust based as well. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 12:22:04
Actually some good news. Hong Kong the THE place to be for banking.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:54
You are just waiting to get in, aren´t you? :P
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:19:02
If you imagine no speculators, the price would not have soared, and would not have the press coverage, which... you get the picture. I believe speculators has been a necessity  at this point, but it migh also be the cause of a crack if major vendors doesn´t come on board. The coming month or two will be the roughest, but also the most profitable. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:43:48
Then it´s a steal :P 
This ddos shit is unfortunate (if that really is the case, and I suspect so), but in a way it is fortunate if we vould get ris of all the short-term speculators.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:38:33
How hi will it go? ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:19:50
Hard to see until the trading lag fades.
