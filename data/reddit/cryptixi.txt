Ultimately it would end up being a tiny pc in a secure lockbox stored for the next several years. Technically I think it meets my needs

What you’re doing is fine. The keys are the same between the two.
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:32:29
What do you mean by use? As in scrap it after performing a send? Or never even receive to the same address? Also, I created the wallet in electrum app while offline. Does this mean I’m good or can those addresses already be compromised?
@_date: 2019-07-08 09:37:15
Damn.. thank you. Yes, similar to iota although this appears to be a resolved bug. Appreciate the info.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:00:52
This is perfect. I’ll give both a bit of research. Ty!
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:34:55
Thanks guys, I think I’m opting for a Trezor wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:39:38
I’m using Electrum because I want to be able to send offline transactions.

Ty, I noticed there’s one called “Armory”. Looks like it offers the exact feature set I’m looking for. Any idea if this is a good one?
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:48:58
Please list one exchange that this method works for. Cmon ffs.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:14:28
Is there a solution that isn’t a hard wallet?

@_date: 2019-07-08 00:02:04
Are you implying bitcoin is like iota? Where after sending once, the address becomes easily compromised forever??
@_date: 2018-09-22 12:22:06
Great read, thank you!

Dental implants for 395 sounds sketchy AF ��

Usually all of these machines only let you buy, and rip you off completely when you do. At least in my area, it’s a complete joke.

It’s AML KYC compliance.. not sure what’s so hard to understand about that.
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:57:37
Not true. Depends on when you bought/sold. Lots of stories on here where people lost their savings and homes so let’s be realistic on that point.

You should pay off debt first minus the mortgage (different kind of debt). Once you pay off your credit card, student loans etc, then find a reasonable amount to invest steadily but one that still allows you to pay your mortgage off somewhat early. Also don’t stop contributing to non-crypto investments (aka diversify). All of crypto is a high risk investment. No matter how much you like a project, never forget that and never put all eggs in any one basket. My recommendation... not financial advice ;)
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:48:45
That’s a gamble and depends on your risk appetite. I do think the odds over a period of time are in your favor but this is truly an unpredictable market. You can lose everything or make millions.

I think the better question is what is a digital decentralized currency worth to you? It returns freedom to the people because it isn’t controlled by any governments that can act in a way to support big business interests instead of the common person. It gives you an alternative to banks that take your money and give nothing back (.01% yearly apr kinda stuff). It gives you options for lower interest digital loans. It can’t be taken away by Uncle Sam or anyone else because someone decided to freeze your account somewhere. You can’t be fined for it and it’s immutable. What is your freedom worth to you? I think what a decentralized global digital currency represents is priceless. That’s why so many people even started to buy it. They loved what it represents. And the speculation of an adopted deflationary currency along with the returns which would come upon success.

In the eyes of the IRS, it's the same as cashing out. You're selling a property to buy another property. You just created a taxable event. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:10:37
All of this is your risk, I agree. Just consider that exchanges are quickly adopting KYC and once regulations etc. has been implemented - they may actually be able to audit successfully moving forward. I'm talking about our trade histories being sent over to whatever tax authority resides in said country. Always consider the risks and make your bets I suppose.

Coinbase -.-
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:56:59
Obviously on a btc thread this won’t get any approval but I agree with you. We need fiat pairs, not btc pairs. This will lead to an overall much less volatile market. BTC has some usefulness for now but I bet money that its power over the market will diminish (although slowly) as fiat pairs are introduced more and more.

They will to a degree and there is nothing wrong with that. Taxes and regulations can both be healthy. Additionally, if things should ever become “toxic” in that regard, technology can find a way to correct those problems as well. This can be a long off-line conversation if you’d like to know more but essentially, this helps keep government regulations in check as well. Blockchain is already seeing adoption today which is massively growing so when you say “why would they allow?”, you need to understand this is already happening and it cannot be easily reversed if at all. There is a need and desire for these benefits and even more so on the technology / society part which is driving the blockchain movement forward exponentially.

The very last sentence addresses your profit statement. Different people have different reasons for buying, especially early on. And still, to lump everyone into one greedy group is irrational to me. Sounds like you’re eating your own dog food and buy for the greed, that’s cool, you gotta do you. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:13:15
It’s a completely silo’d off place to buy and hold crypto. Personally, I believe that if it’s not your private key, you don’t own it. If I can’t send my coin to my private wallet, then it’s not a full featured or realistic exchange. All you ever really own are IOU’s.

Herp always comes back... always..
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:17:26
Yes and trade crypto for crypto but only within the one exchange. You can literally never leave or move your coins out.
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:40:40
You have to document each trade at the time of the trade. There are services that will let you import excel sheets generated by exchanges and output a form. It can be crypto to crypto, not just fiat since each trade is a taxable event.
