Bitcoin will last

A guy with a $100M/month investment budget can’t buy bitcoin, how embarrassing this must be for you 
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:05:52
Hodl is what’s I’m doing, I invested what I could afford to lose. Of course the buy low sell high would have netted me more btc, I simply held through the highs and am holding through the lows. The reason why I haven’t sold yet is two: I missed selling at the high, and selling now would place me into a negative.

Excellent Constanza reference
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:57:57
Can you at least tell us when?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:02:49
We who held in January were greedy, and then the next months we held hoping it would go back up, because of greed. Mixed in with some foolishness, to be sure.
I could have sold at least when I was at a break-even point, but still I did not, because I looked at the past charts and they showed me that BTC would infact go back up. Still, it drops.
Still, I hold. At this point, I am holding because I am hoping to regain back to even—foolish, maybe. The key is that I did not invest more than I could lose.
I hope that all who enetered the market followed the number one investment rule, too.

$200,000 deposits to enter the auction. Thanks government for letting US have a chance to participate. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:05:42
I lost it all when i bought in.
Don’t need any stop losses
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:57:15
I mean, I get where you’re coming from. Crypto is volatile, anyone who knows anything about crypto knows and accepts this. However, very few people are likely to find a drop in price, a drop in their portfolio, palatable. I would have used a different word.
@_date: 2018-03-06 05:47:42
What a cop-out comment.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:39:10
Yeah right, if you sold why are you posting during a big dip?
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:34:09
��Ohhh noooo, read the wallet it says FaKEw4LL3t in the name!
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:45:25
True. They gave Ethereum a B and it has not lost 50% like btc, only about 35% ��
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:53:32
Lol. Really low level scam. 
Might trick a few people to try it haha. Good one.
Also, you’re doing a bad thing, scamming people, if you didn’t know, now you know.
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:29:57
Lol. If you think winning is based on a technicality, then yes you win. Otherwise, too few people use palatable the way you did. 
But I will add to your day being made better and say that you win! ��
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:55:11
Yes, please be more specific in your thoughts. If you leave it as is, you may as well have kept it to yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:55:33
You mean coinbase has given me special privileges? Lol not sure why, I am small time
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:13:09
5 weeks in crypto is like predicting 5 years in the stock market. Understand?
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:33:04
Context. I get it. Still, you find the price dropping as a good thing? It would be far more palatable if the price increased
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:04:20
While “acceptable” is a synonym for palatable, I am sure that it is not a commonly used synonym, nor definition of the word. Can you think of a better work to use in its place? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:51:51
I’m pretty sure what you are describing is not arbitrage trading. Agree with the bots but its not articifial manipulation is a human set up a program/bot to do some trading
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:14:26
Down to 1k ??
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeit. I would be buying 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:32:49
Coinbase has instant purchases through your bank
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:40:22
Trust me, we might not like TA, but we are hopeful for a turnaround 
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:05:22
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:45:35
Odd that JP Morgan Chase has such a low friendly score. They have been promoting crypto investments the past two weeks. 
That shows us how slow to change banks are vs crypto

Quick search, found this: 
TurboTax website

@_date: 2018-02-23 06:05:31
Also, at this point it’s just semantics
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:51:21
No ethics or moral development. Some people are not well-adjusted individuals
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:09:38
Palatable? Are you saying that in crypto it’s more pleasant to taste the drop in price?
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:15:02
You take the gtr and I'll take the nsx 
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:31:37
I would like to think it’s that simple but most assholes don’t have that much money (even put together) to move the market is a great way. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:23:03
Coinbase tax reporting
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:32:09
Hopefully we only need to pay taxes on the forks we actually go and claim
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:21:43
It is to your liking if crypto drops in price then?
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:29:21
Solid post with easy to understand information. Thank you for your contribution.
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:33:18
GT... what am I looking for? Oh yeah! FO
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:08:10
We know it went below 10K again. We are all refreshing our BTC prices every second. 
Thank you for your contribution
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:48:50
What are you talking about. Long winded troll post much
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:25:04
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:44:20
Question, is it hindsight bias or were they correct? To prove this either way takes more predictions on Weiss's part. 
One thing is for sure, they are currently correct 100% of the time (only because they made one prediction).
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:16:18
Depends which site/exhange you got it on. Some will offer you an excel document, otherwise you can print your buy/sell history.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:11:28
BTC rallied from 9600 to 9800 in 30 mins from 650 to 710 PST?
