They unverified me because my passport expired and support just ask me to resend docs which they refuse. Any way to prove my identity legally without buying a new passport? I don't even want to trade there I just want my coins back.

I thought because they are culpable they might help me out but no help from support other than linking me to their youtube video or their terms and conditions page. 
They won't let me withdraw my btc with an expired passport but it was fine for me to deposit with an expired passport as verification. I have a bunch of ID and I'm sure they could verify me if they cared about their customers but they don't. 
It looks like they are going by the book as an excuse to trap funds as banks have to comply with kyc and their requirements aren't as stringent.

My bad, probably a scammer.

Stamp unverified me since my passport expired just before the china crash. 
I can't believe a high res passport and drivers license with bills and bank statements isn't enough to verify my identity just because it's out of date.
I've been back and forth with support and they just tell me to resend the ID then refuse it again. Is it possible to get my coins out? I really don't want/need a new passport.
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:14:07
Update: I can close my account but I can't have my coins until I provide ID. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:25:35
I wouldn't risk selling now if I was in btc.

Bitstamp accepted my expired passport then froze my account because it's expired. If you've got a valid passport I'm sure you'll be fine just don't expect any help from support if you're in my position. Would love to get my coins off there without spending £80 on a passport I don't want/need.

Won't be long until some do, makes sense when the price is down so I guess it's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:34:38
The price has dropped by $30

Surely their high fees are a sign they're not running on a fractional reserve. I would like to know what happens to these "unclaimed" funds though.

Chinese credit drying up?

I'm in the uk and signed up to pingit from Barclays because of paypal. There are no fees and registration is easy.

Bitstamp accepted my passport for verification even though it was expired, now they've frozen my account (just before April 15th china crash) and are refusing the same passport. I can provide ample documentation which should suffice with a passport and drivers license even if they have expired. They just ask me to resend documentation and say it doesn't meet their requirements quoting aml-kyc regs but also they state they're not regulated in their aml policy page. 
"Whilst Bitstamp are currently unregulated and do not fall with the scope of the AML/CTF obligations in the UK the senior management have implemented systems and procedures that meet the UK AML legislation." 
This feels like hostage taking or reluctance to provide anything other than copy paste support at the least. I don't want/need a new passport so what can I do? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:57:16
It's probably legit security procedures. Set up 2fa if you haven't already.
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:45:40
Why not? When I submitted my passport they said nothing about valid expiry dates. Now you have to fill in the expiry dates so I think I have a point. I can prove my identity through other means but I just get a copy paste response every time. 
I can open a bank account with my current documents but I can't get my coins out of stamp...
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:50:06
That's what I thought so I don't want to photoshop my passport as they could use that against me. I'm going to try and close my account now. Will probably need legal advice as they'll just refuse. They accepted an expired passport to begin with so they should accept some responsibility here. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:26:58
Lesson learnt, will be using my own wallet from now on.
I presumed (I know) that they would only prevent fiat withdrawal if there was ever a problem with my ID. 
Does anyone know if I submitted my brothers passport and changed my name on the account settings if that would work? 
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:22:43
There must be millions in unclaimed BTC on their books and they know many won't risk sending photo ID for whatever reason.

I requested to close my account earlier so I'll report back when I get a response. I sent high res images but now you have to enter expiry dates, tried putting an extra ten years on but got refused. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 11:56:40
My coins are stuck on stamp, passport expired and they won't accept other forms of ID. They really need an appeal process IMO. My bank wouldn't get away with this.

They do that on stamp too but it's usually five or seven hundred, not sure if the whale changes his mind or just dumping his coins. This last week has been trap after trap.

When one chart is showing $99 btc and another is showing $500 it looks bad for bitcoin. If people drive the price down to $100 and increase their btc to compensate that sucks for those that held. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:39:02
I had a long discussion with a customer services rep and he is not willing to compromise. I have resubmitted my drivers license and my passport but now you have to fill in expiry dates which wasn't the case before and when I fill in the wrong dates it gets rejected. 
I know they can verify me and that's why I'm so annoyed. I have birth certificate, recently expired passport and drivers license, national insurance card, utility bills in my name, a bank account in my name and a bunch of other documents.
@_date: 2014-04-03 09:23:10
Normal day trading litecoin I often buy when they put up their big sell wall and sell when I see the buy wall pop up. Another one is when they pump up the price and slam a big sell wall down and probably start buying into it, everybody thinks they're going to the moon and when the wall has been eaten support disappears and price drops. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:47:28
I spend my btc when they are worth more.

I can get a passport in 24 hours if absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:16:43
Same here. My passport has expired and so has my drivers license. I'm in uk and would like to know if they accept any other photo ID. This is a real pain and seeing as I didn't purchase my btc from them freezing btc withdrawals seems seriously unfair. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:15:40
I love bitstamp and it's been even better since gox stopped trading. I've noticed what looks like people spreading fear about them but some are plugging their own exchanges. Hard to tell who's telling the truth but if they are fearmongering on the back of gox I don't consider that good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:08:40
I bought in at 569 because gox is no longer trading. Never want to see $100 bitcoins again.

I am in the UK and they are registered in the UK so I would like to complain. They can't have it both ways, stating they are complying with regulation whilst basically confiscating funds in a way that should be illegal in any business environment.
I'm not sure if they're running a fractional reserve business, more likely their staff will pocket all the unclaimed btc. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:47:38
I actually found the "PBOC hasn't banned bitcoin" headline a little disappointing.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:28:50
Two of the four largest online computer retailers accept btc in the uk. If the price goes up people are more likely to spend them.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:21:57
Seems this article was their trigger because it's old news. There's been a lot of strange movements like huge dumps after good news in the press and it feels like bitcoin won't be allowed to go up until everyone believes it's dead.

It looks like you have to pay £25 fee for every transaction/international bank transfer on bitcoin.de. You can't just top up your account with funds and trade with that either.

TAX TREATMENT OF OPERATIONS VIRTUAL CURRENCY DOH-2 AND CITA-2
Note TARS, no. 4210-11634/2013 23 12 2013
Tax Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter: the Tax Administration) has received queries from taxpayers relating to the tax treatment of transactions with bitcoin virtual currency.
Since tax legislation does not contain specific provisions governing the tax regime operating with virtual currencies, we mentioned the problems noted by the Ministry of Finance and asked for their opinion.
Interpretation of the Ministry of Finance, which also relates to the tax treatment of such business after the Tax Act corporation, summarized below.
"Bitcoin virtual currency is not considered a monetary asset within the meaning 7 point 4 of the Law on Payment Services and Systems Act (Official Gazette of RS, no. 58/09, 34/10, 9/11 and 32/12). Also, bitcoin is not considered a financial instrument.

The amount of income in euro shall be fixed taking into account the value of the Bitcoin Euro at a time when the income is received.

In accordance with the aforementioned capital gains, which is a natural person achieves by selling bitcoins, does not pay income tax.
Income derived by a natural person achieves in the form of bitcoins in creating or. "Mining" shall be taxable as other income by 105 Article ZDoh-second The amount of income in euro shall be fixed taking into account the value of the Bitcoin Euro at a time when the income is received.
b) Income achieves a natural person in the course of activities

After the second paragraph, to determine the revenue and expenditure, the rules on the taxation of the corporation, unless this Act provides otherwise. More about corporate tax described below.
Profit from trading with Bitcoin, or income from "mining" that achieves a natural person in the course of the activities referred to in Chapter III.3. ZDoh-2 are therefore taxed as income from activities under the provisions of ZDoh-second
According to the Law on Corporate Income Persons (Official Gazette of RS, no. 117/06, 56/08, 76/08, 5/09, 96/09, 110/09 - ZDavP-2B, 43/10, 59/11 , 24/12, 30/12, 94/12 and 81/13, hereinafter: CITA-2), the tax base is tax resident or non-resident for the activity or business in a business unit or across business units in Slovenia, the profits to be determined in accordance with the provisions of CITA-2 (first paragraph of Article 12).

Stated the general provisions concerning the assessment and determination of the tax base by CITA-2, which is used if there is no income for each specific arrangements.
We note that the current CITA-2 has no specific or express provision for the tax treatment of income associated with business / trading bitcoins.
In view of the above, to determine the tax treatment of authoritative accounting rules, specifically, to determine the tax base, the revenues and expenses identified in the income issue.
In terms of powers of taxation conclude that the accounting treatment described in the trade / business or in a form that depends on the circumstances of each case. "
