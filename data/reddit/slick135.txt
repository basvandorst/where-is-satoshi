Priority of transaction processing is typically by fee per transaction size (bytes). Transaction size is primarily dependent on number of "inputs" and "outputs", not the amount of bitcoin you're transferring. Inputs are pieces of bitcoin you've received previously in that wallet which you are now sending on to another wallet (FYI - your previous incoming payments into your wallet do not actually mix, they stay as small pieces). Therefore, if you've received lots of small transfers in the past and now you're trying to empty the wallet, you'll have quite a few inputs which you're sending out now, which will increase your transaction size dramatically, and therefore your required fee to be competitive against other transaction's satoshi/byte ratio.
Check out [this comment]( for info on how to try to consolidate your bitcoin. It references the electrum wallet, but I believe Ledger has the same replace-by-fee option.

This. Its not the best user interface, but it has the most functionality I've found (including Segwit, replace-by-fee, custom fees, and hierarchical deterministic wallet) after trying out pretty much all other iOS wallets.

Actually there was some good data about a week ago all over reddit showing the simultaneous drop in network transactions/sec when coinbase went down. It came to light that they weren't batching transactions which was causing significant spamming of the network (in addition to overpaying fees).

Is this really just going *woosh* over everyone's heads?
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:33:59
Ah, yeah, devbitcoin and vbenes are correct. 3944 bytes is massive (due to number of inputs). Typical transaction is more like 223 bytes.

When you setup your transaction in electrum and hit "preview", what is the "size" listed? It looks like right now only ~300+ satoshi/byte transactions are getting into the next block, which should only be ~$10 for normal sized transactions.

So this got me thinking, and I think it finally clicked for me.
Current blocks are seeing an average transaction size of ~500 bytes. With 0% Segwit that is ~2k transactions per block (i.e. ~3/second) . With 10% Segwit (which seems to be where we're close to at the moment) that is  ~2.8k transactions per block (i.e. ~4.6/second), which seems to be roughly matching the transaction rate the system is seeing right now at these high fees. 
If we were at 75% Segwit right now, it would be ~6k transactions per block (i.e. 10/second), which would eat through the entire unconfirmed transaction pool in ~7 hours.
If we were at 75% Segwit right now AND Shnorr signatures were enabled, it would reduce the average transaction size down to ~250 bytes. That would result in ~12k transactions per block (i.e. 20/second), which would eat through the entire unconfirmed transaction pool in ~2.5 hours.
Sure, as soon as the fees drop, incoming transaction rate would increase significantly, but I think it still shows how these new adoptions can drastically change the landscape of Bitcoin.

Great write-up. This should be higher considering half of the new posts are asking about why their transaction fees are so high.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:02:13
Auviewer is right. Its a complex transaction due to many inputs (small pieces of bitcoin you've received previously, which you're now forwarding on). That pushes up the transaction size. Since you aren't using Segwit, that's even more detrimental. The real key is the satoshi/WU figure in that transaction, which you're paying only 37.4 sat/WU for, while the current going rate is ~~200+~~ at least over 75. So hopefully you're either patient, or used a wallet that enables replace-by-fee so that you can increase it ~~~5~~ 2 fold if you need it quickly.

Because we know the currently implemented changes that haven't been fully utilized (Segwit) and the upcoming advancements (Lightning Network and Schorr signatures) are worth waiting patiently for.

Yeah, when depositing into GDAX from coinbase (the first part of my message above), there is no transaction fee (since it's off the blockchain). When withdrawing from GDAX to your own wallet (the second part of my message above), GDAX covers the fee.

Bitcoin transaction fees are in slight turmoil at the moment, but you can usually still get reasonable transaction fees and times if you're willing to wait ~1 week. Check [Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool]( to see the current transaction fees which are being eaten (processed). Just this past weekend I was paying 70 satoshi/byte transaction fee and getting confirmed in the next block (&lt;10 mins), and not even from a Segwit address.

Log into GDAX, click accounts, click the down arrow next to your bitcoin account on the left (i.e. "deposit"), make sure you choose from "Coinbase Account" at the top, and deposit for free. Then click the up arrow next to your bitcoin account on the left (i.e. withdraw), make sure you choose "BTC address" at the top, and fill in your external bitcoin address you want to send your bitcoins to. GDAX covers the transaction fee.

You know you’ve made it when someone reposts you [six years later]( 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:17:55
Very interesting. I see a lot of transactions that look really weird. Anyone have any idea what is happening in these?

Binance. No registration for under ~2BTC. Though when I checked yesterday, Monero withdrawal was under maintenance
