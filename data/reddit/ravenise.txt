just wait and see; i need to know who the fuck is what the fuck is what, there are a lot of angry people out there who know a lot more than I do at this point.

yes yes, your opinion is so important, it makes me curious why have you not commented on my video yet

You make some interesting points;  I'd be moving my BTC into BCH right now if I could; seems totally counter productive; makes me question his motives also. if he would rather rip off his wallet users anyway, whats around the corner for bch?

Not the founding principals and vision by Satoshi. The core team and blockstream put the nail in in the bitcoin coffin just like Apple has with their planned obsolescence.  It was originally designed for your average man or woman looking to put in what little money he/she can afford to help them thrive and survive the current parasitic financial paradigm, but now its designed for a greater transfer of wealth to the super rich. There are ethical alternatives that do it right like BCH. But the only cash I have is locked in bitcoin and I can't even move it. Time for a class action lawsuit.

sorry I didn't realize you had to be an oligarch or a millionaire to invest into bitcoin

as far as I've come to understand, bch is closer to satoshis highly moral and scalable vision than what you are referring to as the so called "original" bitcoin; I haven't heard any arguments that hold any water against those claims.

now that is a brilliant question, (minus the insults) I look into that don't you worry
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:49:11
ok then, seems you are right on the money; thanks!

look i get what people may be facing, i see what happens to countries that don't have a rothschild private central bank, or say fuck you to the IMF and pays off all of their debts! The entire planet is sick and tired of the systems that no longer work for the greatest good of all people. We need an alternative system, and that is the traditional bitcoin and blockchain itself; and its not going away. they can try to stop it but it keeps on comin;

thank you for the information.

bitcoin is doomed to fail, unless it sticks to the original plans at its very core, which were already perfect;
