Is this the part where I speculate wildly about the imminent demise/success of Bitcoin?

Relevant username.

Yep. If you don't use it with this in mind I kind of wonder why you're using Bitcoin at all.

Cash in mail is certainly more traceable. I'm talking about internet transactions here. Outside of that, you're certainly right. Let's just say I have enough insider knowledge to know that unless something better comes along the black market will be enough to keep it from dieing completely.
If I'm wrong it was still a good experiment that will lead to something even better soon enough.

You just have to channel through an intermediary and falsifying your information. Do it multiple times if you like. No one is going though extreme lengths to track a fucking bitcoin. Not the FBI, not even Interpol. Plus you have to relative to any other method, cash is the only thing better, but since you aren't in direct contact you have to ship it to them and that's where you run into problems. Try to make a transaction using CIM, you'll get turned down for sure.

Also, I shouldn't have implied it was entirely untraceable. If you take enough precaution it's virtually untraceable.
I'll have to read what you linked me to though, looks really interesting.

I won't pretend to be a network security expert, but I trust the people that explained it to me and for any practical purposes you can buy something with them without using your name, email, IP, or any other personal information involved with very little effort. That's enough.

What the hell does burning the paper and smelting anything do for you? In world were everyone else is gone that isn't really getting you far. You're not wasting your time smelting things you can loot from a store and you're probably burning things that burn far better (and are more plentiful) than any currency note. My point is simply that he doesn't know what fundamental value is if he thinks it has anything to do with what it would be worth if everyone else is gone. That's just an irrelevant thought experiment.

If everyone in the world disappears most people wouldn't have much interest in forging gold and silver objects. The only things that would have fundamental value would be water, shelter, food, etc.
If that's what he means then no currency has any fundamental value at all. Why would he bring it up when discussing a currency? It's barely relevant when discussing anything in the modern world since everyone else in the world isn't going to disappear anytime soon.
Edit: According to Wikipedia: "It is ordinarily calculated by summing the future income generated by the asset, and discounting it to the present value. Simply put, it is the actual value of a security as opposed to the market or book value."
This doesn't jive with what you're saying about hypothetical mass extinction scenarios.

He doesn't think bitcoins have fundamental value. Obviously he doesn't realize the value of untraceable currency to the black market.

It's possible, I have no idea. If anyone could share some insight here I'm genuinely quite interested.

It sounds like something of that nature only adds to the volatility of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:18:27
Isn't buying Bitcoin only to instantly sell it right back kind of unstabilizing?
