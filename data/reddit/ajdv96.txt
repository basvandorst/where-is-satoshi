Only 100% scam free? That doesn’t sound *that* scam free

Fair enough, but I would still have to disagree with the initial comment saying his career is a fraud. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:30:01
it’s not that serious lol

He literally hasn’t lost a professional fight in his life, the last fight he lost was in amateur boxing. He’s not a fraud, just one of the most dominate athletes ever.

Did he not just beat McGregor who is in his prime, while Floyd is 40 and obviously out of his prime? Granted McGregor is from the UFC I get that, but still considered one of the best fighters at the moment.

fuck you
*not meant to be confrontational btw
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:15:18
what the *fuck*
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:01:18
I think saying “fuck you” to someone is confrontational... or am I the only one?

I could care less about libra and will not be buying it, but yes you are partially right in regards to me losing faith in alts. But also you’re making the wrong move when someone is converting to bitcoin. You should support people making the switch if you want to see mass adoption. Being negative and demeaning will not make people want to buy bitcoin, just my opinion of course.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:05:20
For sure. Honestly at this point I’m just looking for the long term hold and don’t enjoy the speculation on alts anymore.

No. Me taking an ass whooping on a *small* eth stake was not the only reason I converted. After a culmination of things including some failed speculations but more importantly further research on crypto it lead me to convert to bitcoin.
But honestly man idk why your so pissed about this. Enjoy people converting to bitcoin and look forward to adoption. Stop acting like I fucked your girlfriend or something.

I mean I already converted because I do think bitcoin is better... what more do you want from me lol.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:55:00
I took an ass whooping on eth and got to the point today where I realized that it doesn’t get better than bitcoin. I feel better about this than I have ever felt about any of my other crypto moves.

Maybe it’s because I’m broke, but a credit card with a $70,000 limit is crazy to me.
