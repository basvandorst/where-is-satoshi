iirc coinbase is registered as a money transfer agent. They are also in the US so they can be held legally responsible for shit like this .

yeah, which is super good considering a lot (most?) of the books in the bible were written hundreds of years after the events they write about.
80 years is long, but its very possible there could still be witnesses alive.
 obviously the bible isn't meant to be taken literally and its not a history book.

Super misleading title... only .01% of their franchises were affected. 
OP makes it sound like everyone in those 24 states got their numbers stolen... I'm not even sure why the number of states matters in this situation. 
It definitely isn't as important as the number of franchises affected.

The fact that its over $10,000 might also be an issue as they have to report it to the IRS iirc.

How hard is it to get German citizenship as an american? Do they have a foreign investment dealio like the US does?
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:17:22
Its a program in the USA... the gist of it is that if you invest at least $500k in certain areas of the country, you can qualify for citizenship super easily. I can't find anything similar in the EU, but I did mostly look just in Germany. 
After looking into german citizenship for something like OP is talking about, it is extremely drawn out- plus, US citizens will have to denounce citizenship, and may still owe tax. Not really worth it or practical. 
If denouncing US citizenship isn't a big deal to someone, Belize or Panama seem to be the way to go. You would still have to consider the tax liability you may have at the time of giving up citizenship, but no capital gains tax and its very easy to get citizenship/permanent resident status. 
Another option is [Puerto Rico]( although there is more reading I need to do on it.

I always wonder who the stupid people are who buy coins at the top of the market... I guess I've finally found out.
The best thing you can do it stop everything and do nothing for 4-6 months. If you're lucky, you'll be able to make some money. Stop the quick trading shit, you're gonna get in more trouble that way. Its not like you got in when it was under $1 and you can just piss it away on a whim.
I know a lot of people are gonna probably talk shit about this, but look into getting subscription to [this]( newsletter (or another one) about the market. When I was heavy into trading, it helped me a lot. I haven't been subbed to it for over a year now, so YMMV.
What you have done is terrible and I'm guessing you will only make it worse if you try to do more of your "trades". One thing I've learned is that you shouldn't act on a whim based on the immediate actions of the market. Sure, you might win big, but chances are you'll lose even bigger. 
@_date: 2013-02-12 22:42:00
Yes, did this but there is no .wallet file at all in any of my backups.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:43:03
That's a fairly arbitrary question. Kind of like asking "why do some banks have more money than others?"
Also, it makes perfect economic sense. The only way it wouldn't is if everyone that used btc had an account at every exchange. If this was the case then something like this would indeed be weird. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:58:51
Well, I still have the active wallet, I just don't have access to it right now. I didn't restore a backup over an active wallet if thats what you are thinking. 
I restored the backup to my new laptop, and my old laptop is back home so I'll have it sometime in the future. I would just have preferred to not to have to wait. 
I'm gonna look into the rescan thing, it might be able to fix it.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:16:03

@_date: 2013-11-24 21:55:58
Don't use a wallet on your phone either.
@_date: 2013-02-13 13:47:12
Man, May is a long time for delivery. Right now, a 1,500 GH/s rig will be 10% of all mining traffic, correct? About $5k a day.... even half of that, or 1/5 of would be very very respectable. Hell, even $500 a day would be worth the initial investment.
Any idea on a realistic $$ amount that I could expect if the difficulty factor? 
Thanks for helping me out! I never got into mining as trading made me enough :)
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:03:16

There have been BTC porn sites for years dude; not really sure why you think you're the first. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-09-05 17:55:36
No, this will NEVER HAPPEN. Ever. 
Why? Simple... they can't control it like they can control credit card payments. They can't reverse things. Also, they can't really make money off of it like they can with paypal. Plus a ton of other obvious issues that stand in the way. 
@_date: 2013-02-12 22:56:01
Hey man, thanks for responding. 
No hits on " key-backup-base58" in any files.
The device was rooted, so I'm not sure what happened. I know the address of the wallet all the coins are sitting in, but I dont think that is very useful.

Yeah I understand that now after reading some stuff on the butterfly labs forum. They still say that realistically you can see $9000/mo. which isn't too shabby.
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:31:02
Interesting, but a few things...
* Its not free to transfer money between accounts. 
* If an account in anyways linked to the network, it will be frozen, they will just follow the money and start freezing shit and you will have to go prove you aren't doing anything illegal. We won't even know if the account is being targeted until its frozen and all of the people that have ever sent to or recieved from that account will be frozen.
* How many possible btc addresses are there? That's how many accounts we will need. I don't think banking is at this point yet. 
* He says it himself: "The people who have to initially open the checking accounts hold a huge responsibility, and at the same time, a huge risk."
Its just a bad idea. I get what hes trying to say, but until we can make bank accounts as easily as creating a new address, then this won't work.
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:00:38
I don't think its 100 transactions, but rather 100 different addresses.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:26:36
But the sun...
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:50:26
I agree with all of this! Its already super easy to buy btc. I do think that we need to do more to facilitate in person cash exchange, although being able to go to the bank and deposit monies in the exchange's account directly (as some already allow) works well too. 
Im also anti-mt.gox, buy they are arguably the only exchange capable of creating anything like a b&amp;m exchange location.  They could be as small as an atm or as large as an average bank. This would greatly increase the already high liquidity of btc, and also increase user base by increasing availability. Id support that.
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:53:32

No, I never used that option. My phone was rooted but like I said, those files are just not there :/
The private key thing is something I do not know as much about. Could you share a little more info about them?
@_date: 2013-02-13 05:22:02
Are you saying that they will be making new ones soon? Or that they are not going to make as much money in 3-6 months? Is there any reason I shouldn't get one?
@_date: 2013-02-13 04:37:58
So is that 1,500 gh/s rig for $30k worth it then? If I have the btc to spend is it something I should look into?
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:32:26
I have bad luck with losing coins lol. I will 100% be getting one of these. I'm looking forward to the kickstarter!
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:43:59
Yeah, I read a little about pywallet... I'm working on getting that set up. It sounds promising! 
I'll report back with results.
@_date: 2013-02-13 16:35:28
Interesting, but if its 797.7759 GH/s from 587 people, that doesn't seem very good for me if I'm going to drop $30k on a 1,500 GH/s rig.

@_date: 2013-10-04 01:29:58
I'll give you one guess on what it was used for...
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:10:08
Well, I was using the wallet app on my droid because at the time, it was 100% necessary for me to have all my coins on my phone for security reasons I rather not get in to. Long story short, my phone broke and along with my own stupidity, I lost my whole trading bank. It was my single biggest loss. 
I used to say my phone was the most expensive phone in the USA!
@_date: 2013-02-13 13:50:58
If absolutely necessary, I can bring this to my partners and get $$ tomorrow. But like you said, delivery at the end of May would kill it. Congrats on your new rigs though! What kind of profits are you expecting?
Also, I'd like your opinion on what amount it would bring in after a difficulty raise. I'm pretty sure it would be pure speculation, but if you have invested your own money in rigs, then it must be a fairly good idea.
I'm going to start looking for investors willing to take a 1/3 (10K) share in one of the big rigs with me. If anyone is interested, please contact me and we will go from there.
EDIT: I wouldn't be opposed to starting/joining a reddit mining guild or whatever they are called. I believe there are enough of us to create a wave in the pool.

You're absolutely right that I should have had backups, but there was a very specific reason I did not, and I would rather not get into it.
