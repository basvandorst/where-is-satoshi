I do believe we’re making progress. Getting stuck in extremist thought and denying any possible progress outside of the ecosystem you believe (bought) into is counterproductive and hinders any real progress.
People working together generates progress. That is the number one prerequisite. If we don’t have people working together we don’t even have a marketplace. Thinking critically and asking hard questions is much different than vehemently blasting everything aside from what’s in your wallets.

This is a well thought out and informative response. Thank you.

Where can we get it?!

Haha thanks man. I’m genuinely just tying to understand. Politics often get in the way, even when they’re supposed to be non existent.

I wholeheartedly agree with you. Only time will tell and it’s truly exciting either way it ends up panning out. I really enjoy crypto and the space. Maybe one day people will play nice together. Or not.

Thank you for this input. What alternatives would you suggest?

I admittedly don’t know a lot about Roger and the history of the fork. I’ll do some more research on this.

By playing to their strengths. BTC acting as a store of value and long term investment. BCH being used for transaction speed and ease of use. 
It’s no different than having a good coin (investment, not easy to spend)  in a pocket full of cash (can be spent, recognized anywhere quickly and easily).

I have to disagree. Thanks for your valuable contribution.

Thanks bro! Your insight was a major help. Take it easy.

Grow up and be blind to prejudice and narrow mindedness. Lol right.

Yes they do coexist currently. But it seems like NOBODY is happy with that and wants to snub out the opposition rather than finding a way to work together.
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:48:11
Lmao, fair enough.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:52:34
Boom.
