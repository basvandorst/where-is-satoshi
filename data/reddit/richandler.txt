Why hodl when you can hoadr instead!
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:53:03
Next time send me money pls. Need buy more bitcoin.

They've been taking a while. Just be glad you deposited to the USD account and didn't lock-in any all time highs.
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:59:27
Uh, if you don't have a direct deposit of at least $250/month you have something seriously wrong. Unemployment will direct deposit more than that.

Every inch matters.

Why would you cash out on the future?

My CU gives me 2% on my checking. So there is that.

This was one of my questions. But for even lower amounts. Say 0.0003 BTC. Or the 'I want to buy a coffee' example. Not only does it seem the eventual on-chain fee is not waved, it seems like it's ripe to get congested into a backlog that will only continue to grow. If the network is saturated now, I don't see how this solves it.

That ledger company has done such a great marketing job of convincing people to be paranoid as all hell and fork over $100 bucks. What is the point of having bitcoin if you're scared day and night someone is going to steal it?

Something tells me they're gauging whether they should prepare regulations that start to require exchange wallets to be associated with people such that governments can follow peoples publicly published transfers. Basically no more private spending.

The household is a better number. It's also not the only debt people carry.

It's funny when everyone talks up crypto, but was always focused on cashing out the precious country cash.
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:57:44
I like how he calls them kids.

If you had to cut you losses you probably lost more than you should have invested in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:47:52
You didn't turn on screen hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:18:10
Actually it's backed by people getting up for work tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:11:31
You're just highlighting why it's important to have multiple successful cryptos. It's not enough to have one network.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:10
Earn? Hahaha...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:53
Meh, if it's at 14 now from where it was, it could be a 18 tomorrow. People need to chill the fuck out. One of my coworkers kept selling on crashes and it would always go back and he would wonder why he kept losing money. Just stop.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:03:47
Money is an abstract concept period. Don't fool yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:00:55
Well, as long as transaction fees aren't 50% of small transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:40:40


That's not what that move looks like no matter how much it is explained away.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:12:15
How many times did the biggest bubbles in history get called the biggest bubbles in history for months(years?) on end?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:59:11
Seems reasonable. Don't be a liar and a fake about your financial wealth in order to profit off of others is basically what is says.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:03:50


I've never seen a user say they love the fees. If it was controlled by the users there would be no fees at all.

He's the gate keeper though. And he ditched his stake. That's a big deal in any project.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:02:51
Somebody is passively trying to brag about their full coins.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:31:33
Buy more so Chinese and Russian billionaires can continue to slowly skim your money away.

Won’t make any alts useless as they’ll use it too. In fact it’ll highlight bitcoins problems more than anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:38
I think a lot of people are finding out they could never be traders for real work.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:23
Best way to go to jail.

And those companies make products that provide real world value in use today. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:38:41
Stocks are not typically sold in small amounts either. 100 shares blocks are a pretty common unit purchased by companies that then turn around and sell everyone else a portion of that. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:25:58
All those cancer treatments really are destroying the world.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:55:45
All these payment options seem to convert to cash anyway. It just seems like these payment systems are ways for transaction fee collectors to make a ton of money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:39:10
The service to process is fine, but it’s on top of the network fee. But the volatility of price will always discourage payment without conversion. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:34:58
Dude is focused on actually changing the world, not the pretending to like a crypto kid.
@_date: 2018-03-04 07:20:14
Unless you hodl. In which case you just go about your business hodling.
