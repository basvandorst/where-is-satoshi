Hi Coincult,
We have now gone through the TOS and checked for grammar mistakes. We fixed what we could find and hopefully there are none left!

Hi Coincult,
It is not our objective to invalidate bets without any proper reasoning or facts. We would not go through the trouble of licensing, bringing in new game providers and spend resources to develop products for a market where they are not available yet. But of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and interpretation of information. All we can do is help understand specific info we have provided, offer the best possible service in order to prove our legitimacy and keep on developing our products!
As for point 2.1.8. then it is subject to change as soon as legal entities claim it to be a legal currency. At the moment we are unaware of any governments that have given out statements regarding Bitcoin as a legal currency. Even with offering the purchase of "playing tokens" would require BTC transactions to be made by an individual to buy those tokens.
Any feedback is always welcome and if you feel we can or should improve/change specific aspects of our website, like content or TOS, please do provide us with your suggestions as services like ours cannot thrive without the support of the community, therefore we value highly the feedback given by our users and the community!
