MSU and the rest of the BIG10 regularly dominate umich.  BTC is un dominated.  It's insulting to associate umich with btc in any way.  
I think a better analogy is to say that Jim harbaugh is the bcash version of a first rate coach.

I was also banned from there for "ban evasion" despite having never been banned from I was banned right after I trolled their mod here

How would the mods know if I was banned on another account?  I always post from behind a VPN so are they banning the use of public IP addresses? I think they just use ban evasion as a blanket ban to quiet people who disagree with the group think. Ive moderated a subreddit before and know what the mod panel looks like, they have no data to base my ban off.  Its a knee-jerk reaction ban to getting trolled.
I thought that sub was about freedom of speech and not censoring things.  If they are for censoring "provocative usernames" then that's fine, but they need to get off the free speech no censorship high horse then.

I was banned from the other sub by for "ban evasion"
That was my first and only ban from their safe space, and I was banned after mocking a 10 cent on chain tip made.  They censor the hell out of people there and just put bullshit reasons in the mod log to make it appear kosher.
