Check [ by searching with your wallet address. 
I wanted to transfer out my few funds from mtgox to a private address last week. I started with doing a 0.01btc test to see that I won't mess up anything. After not receiving the small amount, I checked that page and found my transaction in the list with the error message "outputs already spent" that has already been mentioned in this thread. After about two days the transaction was removed from the list and a new one was issued but it also failed in exactly the same way. Another two days forward and they retried it again and this time it went trough. I went forward and sent most of my remaining funds to the same address, and this time they appeared instantly.
My point is that they seem to retry sending failed transactions within the 48 hours, but the following transactions can fail just as well, causing in a lot longer wait. It's a good thing to try to figure out what the holdup is. I know I checked that page about ten times a day while waiting for my funds. :)

What is interesting here is that trade volumes have rocketed up on all exchanges during the last eight hours, also on Gox. If people can't get either bitcoins or dollars out of there, why is there so much trading right now?
Volumes can be seen for example at [

All I know is from what happened to me. After two days a new transmission was submitted and that one either succeeds or fails in similar fashion. I suggest you note what your TX number is so that you'll notice if it reappears as a new TX. I wouldn't regard it as lost money.

Great thing. Justcoin's biggest obstacle in my eyes is trading volume. It is hard to get a fair deal as the amount of trades are so low. This will attract a few more orders. A bigger help, however, would be to attract a bunch of smaller traders to rise the amount or orders.

You got too much money or something?
