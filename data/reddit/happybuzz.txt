I've been having the EXACT same problem.. Once I login to the legacy edition then It'll let me login to whatever new or old. Pretty frustrating. I'm gonna contact support and try to figure out exactly what invalid GUID means...

Probably have to wait till XMR takes off a bit more and is more adopted. I was really suprised that AB implemented it quickly but I think it might actually take off... I might have to buy some and lock it away for  at least 6 months. If I'd done that when I first starting using bitcoin and they were $11 a coin, I'd be much better off lol but knowing me I'd have probably sold when they double or tripled having no idea that they'd get this high years down the road... I know that Back in Nov 14 I was in the navy at the time and my buddy had given me like $200 worth of coins I think @ $13 each and in december or whenever it got up to $1300 cuz he couldn't contact me So when we pulled back into port is when they started dropping fast so I just gave him his money back and said I'm sorry bro they didn't tell us we were going out for that long... I'm not going to do the math but it was a hefty free profit lol.

I've been steadily hitting my $3k weekly circle limit for like 3-4 months trading on LBC averaging 10-12% return so I think I'm still in the positives lol.

I bought 1,000 on coinbase on the 16th when it was at like $771 cuz my girl was like its going to keep going up just buy it!!!!! So Instead of just transferring 1k to my USD wallet, I had it go to my regular wallet. So yeah, I'm kinda sweating tomorrow when it does arrive and it's dropped so much. Ouch :-) Not listening to her about things she barely understands lol. Nope not anymore!

Venmo is riddled with fraud. I wouldn't touch that even if the rates were reasonable.
