Quite frankly I had lots of headaches with CB. This is the worst exchange I know.  This is one of those places where they treat small holders like me with not too much respect because we don't have a lots of money for now.

I think Fbook mentioned  they would fabricate their own crypto-currency no more than last month. Either Fbook doesn't want competitors or double speak.

Must be related to last week huge exchange hack on Coincheck (400 millions worth). The hackers are probably dumping their gain on the market and this driving bitcoin prices to drop.

Listen, we can't let people manage their finance individually, they might become "too smart".

I was lucky there was a fuckup at conbase and they wouldn't  reply to emails.  I was spared from the 18,000$ bitcoin hype.

Its backed by mathematical algorithm. Money paper on the other end is not.

Remember, you only get refunded when they actually pay. It's all talk for the moment.

Watchout for the massively insane amount of new crypto currencies coming from this country. This is going to become a safe haven for hodlers and those who seek to shield their profits.

If you think coinsquare is bad try coinbase, you'll floOoooat.

Exchange like Bitconnect will be the first to start coughing when Bitcoins takes a small dip. Just wait a little and everything will be back. At least Bitconnect didn't pull the plugin like Hexabot.top did overnight.

No no no, go more like:
This is good for bitcoin.

How much should a bitcoin worth ? certainly not 20,000 like in December 2017
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:17:02
Oh my little you,  ��

Bitcoins are mined from computers and are backed by  irrefutable mathematical algorithms.  The people who tell you that they aren't backed by anything probably never finished their junior high tuition. Take a day off and watch youtube vids on what is bitcoin mining. That's all I'm gonna say.

Probably because of the sheer number of transactions being made. I can't even load the front page

Bitcoin is so hard to acquire these days with fees at all level and credit card increases. Who in their right  mind is going to use it on EBay ? Fiat serves this purpose better.

Hey everyone, imagine John McAfee eating his dick over a 100,000$ bitcoin really hard.

Could you elaborate, if you didn't sell this is temporary and not definitive bitcoin could surge over summer.

Did you invested a lot ?  Personally I kept myself from putting anything on this platform  because it didn't make sense to lock your initial capital for 290 days. In the crypto world this is a death sentence.

Fluctuation of the market isn't a Crash
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:17:00
Imagine some people have 30k+ locked out on coinbase since November and during the crash ...   They are going nuts over at @_date: 2018-02-03 03:14:55
OP cross post this on I know people over there who would pay to see this.

The current dip is probably in response of the millions in bitcoin that were stolen from coindesk last week. Hackers are probably flooding their gains on the market.   
In not too long bitcoin will be back up I'm sure. Just give it the time it needs.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:22:40
By the way things were going Bit connect would have let you create  bigger interest than all the money printed by man with a 100$ initial capital in 4 years.

Paying your taxes with bitcoins is an oxymoron,  use fiat instead.

Bitcoin took a +2000$  hike since yesterday morning, I bet its going to hit 40,000$ by next December rest assured.  You better buy now at 9,000$ while it last.
