Since we're on a bitcoin subreddit, why wouldn't you just print a paper wallet?  There's plenty of instructions, but basically you go to  and save the page as an HTML document, then turn off your wifi and load the page locally, and simply print out your wallet.  100% secure offline cold storage for free.
I'm just curious why you feel like you need to buy a hardware wallet for security and HODLing

Thanks for the response!  I agree that the hot wallet transfer from paper is an area of uncertainty that makes myself and many others uncomfortable.  In my tests with Mycelium, everything has been fine, but i don't know if I'd trust my life savings to it.  
My other thought is making multiple paper wallets, each with ~.1 BTC on it.  This way it's distributed and makes it easier to spend from cold storage.  Definitely still not as easy and secure as a trezor, but it's an option for others in the same situation that might not have time for a trezor backorder

Exactly.

As someone who used/uses HitBTC, beware of the reliability issues.  On Friday, after getting numerous 503 Errors, I finally logged in to see all of my balances at 0.  Turns out they were upgrading servers or something without telling anyone, and everyone's balances were showing zero too.  Everyone thought it was hacked and funds were lost.  Things restored to normal a few hours after.
In short, I'd use HitBTC for the exchange and then get your coins off immediately into cold storage/paper wallets.  Some of the altcoins are too expensive to transfer, which is why i still hold some on their exchange while I wait for the miner's fee to lower or the balance to significantly increase.  I hate HitBTC, but it does make the initial purchase pretty easy

I realize that I'm a tech when I say this, but there's really no excuse for having your funds on an exchange rather than cold storage when sites like bitaddress.org exist and literally generate a wallet in seconds.
Here's the complexity though, (since I'm paranoid and want my funds impossible to breach through cyberattack) to use the highest degree of security, a wallet should be generated offline.  This is simply done by doing the following:
1. Go to bitaddress.org
2. Go to File &gt; Save Page As &gt; Save it to your desktop
3. Turn off WiFi and unplug ethernet so your computer is 100% offline.  Airplane mode can do this too
4. Open your saved webpage from your desktop
5. Generate your wallet by spinning your mouse around like a magical wizard, literally, you'll see
6. Print your wallet - Don't use a network printer (again, i'm super paranoid when it comes to my crypto investment portfolio)
7. Close your browser
8. Turn on WiFi/reconnect ethernet and you're done
Bitaddress generates the public and private key for Bitcoin wallets.  That piece of paper you printed should be kept very secure in a fireproof safe or similar.

keeping funds on an exchange is always a risk.  Coinbase seems to be pretty reputable, however everyone thinks their exchange is reputable until it is breached.  
For long term investing, always do offline cold storage.  For short term, secure your funds on the exchange as best you can, which means MFA, strong passwords, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:28:04
This is so incredibly wrong, I had to comment to hope people don't take your advice.  Bitcoin is safe and secure when it's not sitting on an exchange.  It is at risk on an exchange.  Plain and simple.
Say a coinbase user doesn't have MFA (multi-factor authentication) on their account and they reused their password when they initially set up their account.  All of the funds from that single account can be transferred and *poof* they're gone.  This is not even an example of a "large scale breach" but rather a personal targeted attack.  
A large scale breach would be coinbase's username/password directory to be exfiltrated, and then once again, anyone without MFA on their account will have their funds drained.
Cold offline storage prevents any sort of credential breach.  
Please stop giving awful advice to the community.

follow Litecoin and Ethereum or do your research and diversify your portfolio.  Litecoin had a HUGE record gain today and it almost doubled (77%ish for 24hrs).  They can both be purchased in Coinbase, just like bitcoin.

How awesome though if they are new and this is the first rise they've seen...  I'd be pretty pumped right now if I started investing spring of '18

Yup it just populated here in the US.  Crazy how it instantly affected the markets.

Haha my dog had a squeaky toy of Mr Bill that said that when it got bit. It was awesome at Thanksgiving randomly going off throughout dinner

Yes, money can always be transferred TO a hardware (ie. offline) wallet.  The balance of your wallet is always on the public ledger.  
In order to SEND (ie take from) your bitcoin, you'll need to access your private key, which is on/is the wallet.  
EDIT - I reread your OP, if you transfer a static amount of bitcoin to a wallet, such as 1 BTC for ~16k, the wallet will always have that number of bitcoin on it.  As the exchange rate fluctuates between BTC and the USD (or any other currency), you could sell your 1 BTC for differing amounts.  To sell your coin off your hardware wallet, you'll need access to your private key, which is on your wallet.

Hey, sorry you're getting downvoted.  What do you need help with?  I'll PM you some info to get started.  It's pretty straightforward.
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:25:37
Depends on your trade strategy. For a HODLer, that makes sense but for swing traders or people trading on the RSI, gains like these are great. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:23:42
I just did a scan on the bitcoin wallet, and it looks like it's an invalid address too... Could it be possible that OP reposted this for worthless internet points?
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:06:30
Yes. We're down 8%. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 21:11:45
If you have $10,000 in BTC, you just made $400 in 15 minutes this morning. 
The only people that don't care about a 4% gain are people investing pennies and hoping to buy a lambo. 
The larger trend is also important. We just went through a brutal bearish year, and now we're starting to pull up and turn bullish. This gain is very significant. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:22:26
I like this.  Saw it hit 4% gains within 15 mins.  
My wife thinks I'm nuts.
These are all bullish signs!
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:22:59
You're thinking about it all wrong... You're looking at dollar amounts and not % increase.  It's up over 4% right now... that is a nice big positive move.
With prices this low, a $200 move is big.  At $20,000, a $200 move is nothing.

Don't invest money you need for bills... Assume you'll lose everything in a high risk/high volitility vehicle. If you're investing your paycheck in hopes it goes up before the bills are due, you're playing with napalm.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:44:22
I think I might have bought your bitcoins. 
Don't day trade. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:37:11
So don't invest money you can't afford to lose completely.  For example, I invested a bunch over the past year AND lost my job over the summer.  I'm financially fine because I invested my "fun money" 
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:23:00
You're a walking contradiction.  "Affording to lose it" rather than spending fiat...which is proportionately less valuable than BTC if you are long term investing....
I'm happy for you though being a wealthy medical professional with an upcoming vacation to Thailand... Enjoy the trip. I've had friends go there for a few months and loved it. Don't get food poisoning tho!

Another idea is to scoop up a card whenever it's available at the high price and mine on it when it's not gaming.  a 1070 card will pay itself off in about 6 months, so I don't really see your point that you can't afford it, unless you don't have the capital.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:22:15
What's their long term prediction 4-5 years out?  Do they think HODLing is still a profitable idea?  Is it only bitcoin?  
Sorry for all the questions, but this sounds interesting but i'm at work  and don't have time to look up the Steem article ATM.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:24:06
Unless they're trying to manipulate it to go up..... There's market manipulation on both sides.  
Happy cake day btw!

Of course it's a Democrat from California that wants to ban crypto...  Without controlling the money, they can't control the people.  In America, we are FREE.  I'll buy and sell, own and give away, anything I damn well please.  We, as Americans, have a right to own property.  Crypto is no different than owning a pencil, a plot of land, or pieces of paper with dead dudes on it.  This Democrat is essentially saying they want to force every citizen to ONLY transact with THEIR regulated banks, with THEIR currency, with THEIR "shitcoin".  The power-hungry Democrats cannot enact their agenda without controlling the money.    
Also, they have no idea how BTC works.  They can never say HOW they would ban crypto, because it's impossible.  Sure, you can investigate and imprison anyone found owning it, but that's about the most immoral thing I've ever heard.  Screw this dude and everything he stands for.
