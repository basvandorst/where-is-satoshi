Bitcoin is still in its infancy so the number of financial services that are built around it are still limited. A lot of the big financial players are still waiting for legal/tax clarification on what bitcoin is from the government. That being said there are other sites besides coinbase like bitquick and bitstamp. The more legit that bitcoin becomes the easier it should be to buy/sell it to fiat.

You need to cash out now and stay the hell away from it. I understand the compulsion to gamble and it's something I never knew I had in me until bitcoin came around. I started messing with gambling on online casinos/poker then gambling on bitfinex with margin, then gambling on ALT coins. Then I used bitcoin to transfer money to another country but I gambled again the price would go up, it went down, I bought with a cost basis of $450 and sold out around $310-350 just before the low of 275$ a few weeks back.
 If there is anything I have learned from bitcoin it is: DONT GAMBLE WITH YOUR MONEY. You will lose it. Now I only have a little bitcoin left because I do love the technology and I actually invest in proper stocks and good companies with a brokerage account which have a minimum value that is above zero (bitcoin can go to zero). I didn't lose a life changing  amount of money and I look at it as an education fee. 
First, you should take all your money out of bitcoin.  Take a break from it. If you can get help try and talk to someone too.

I have 3 questions which I really want to know
1. I use bitcoin sometimes to move money to/from the US, it goes from foreign currency bank account &lt;-&gt; bitcoin &lt;-&gt; US bank account. I assume I also have to include the exchange rate of the US dollar to the foreign currency somehow? How does this change the effective capital gains?
2. If I buy a car with bitcoin it's easy to put a USD price on it or if I buy something on overstock it's pegged to the USD. But what about buying something with no readily definable USD equivalent. Ex: Bitcoinwisdom allows you to go ad free by paying them .15 bitcoins, how is something like this going to be taxed under this new guideline? I see this becoming a bigger issue as bitcoin is used more and more as a currency and less as a wealth transfer/speculative gamble. If the price of bitcoin goes up, cost of service stays unchanged in bitcoin terms with no USD equivalent do we still have to pay a capital gains tax?
3. Gambling. How are capital gains calculated for gambling losses? I assume winnings are just taxed as income but I'm not sure how it counts if I spend .1 bitcoin and then lose it with nothing to show for it.
Hope this wasn't too wordy, really excited to finally get official guidance and glad they haven't decided to ban it. I only got into bitcoin this fiscal year so at least I have more time for the dust to settle before next years tax return.

I think what means to say is that we should stop speculating the value of bitcoin and use it to actually buy/sell goods and services.
But I can't be certain.

This sounds great. I would love to see something like amazon mechanical turk with bitcoin.

That's not really Western Union's fault though. It's probably just the law. I actually think Western Union is in a very good position to use their existing infrastructure for bitcoin transactions.

This is the sad truth that people don't seem to realize. I really love bitcoin and want it to succeed but if the guys in suits want to shut it down they can do so pretty easily.

I hope thats whats up. It seems crazy that China will allow bitcoin to continue though.

Any time you deal with money this is what happens. It's just standard operating procedure. If you don't want this type of stuff just use your bitcoin to buy products/services directly without cashing out to fiat.

I don't bother combing through source code and compiling code myself so to me the risk is the same as using any other binary file I download off the internet. Could multibit, electrum, or the reference client get malicious code in there somehow? It could sure happen but a person can go crazy worrying too much.

That really helps. Thank You!

I am waiting for the blockchain app personally.

I personally make it a policy never to click any links in an email from any credit card/bank/bitcoin related site and manually log in to the site by typing in the URL. When it comes to money I prefer to play it safe.
That doesn't excuse the fact that coinbase screwed up by they are giving your money back and hopefully this won't happen in the future. But I still think it's not a bad idea to always type in the URL manually and see what messages are waiting for you when you login.

I feel like people have been saying bitstamp = mt gox 2.0 for a long time.

Probably had nothing to do with it being a girl or anything, reading reddit enough makes you cynical. I still don't know what to make of those supposed google emails for example.

I'm curious how you are shorting bitcoin? I would love to buy futures or options contracts to short bitcoin right now but I don't think it's possible?
