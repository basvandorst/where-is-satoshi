Appealing to the younger generation?
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:35:01
They can invest money while trying to appeal to younger gens to pull their money in. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:28:19
I agree wholeheartedly, even as a somewhat "above average" user, I'd rather just use a different coin then all that channel mess. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:15:44
Sure, but I'd argue theres a big difference between 2015 and 2016. 
Other then the obvious shit ones (BTG, Dash,etc), most of the top 15 is safe for 1 year. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:13:12
Lmao maybe in the crypto echo chamber. USD is the number one accepted currency in the world.  99% of people 40 y/o+, probably even younger, have no idea how to use it or need to. Straight delusion to believe this will happen even in 10 years. 
The irony of calling USD monopoly money lol

Honestly don't really update my Facebook. But as a user creating a new account, opting to use the 1 click Facebook button is infinitely more convenient then having to fill it manually even with autofill. 
I get the criticism against it, but God damn if I dont get a moment of relief  when can I just click use Facebook to make an account. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:42:08
You should want to know the criticisms and negatives of your investment as well as the competitors. Not knowing is ignorance.

Here's a great video explaining it. Essentially the creator premined the currency and is making a shitload as a legacy node. Way too shady of a history to have its current value.

His point is that they are difficult to control.
Banks are never going to use a decentralized system, I'd be surprised if a large company like Facebook would use one.

Okay man, continue to let other coins start to eat Bitcoin's lunch. 7 tx/s is a joke for a currency. Ethereum is better at doing what bitcoin specializes in, confirms more transactions a day. 
Bitcoin desperately needs an update or it will continue to bleed away to more efficient alts.

Wow the attitude of this thread and r/bitcoin in general. 
OP I agree with you. Scaling is a real issue and could lead to bitcoins demise. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:02:16
Lol agreed
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:35:42
Can *ever* kill Bitcoin?
It can be killed. Oppressive laws could make it obsolete is one example. I honestly think Bitcoin *needs* to die for Cypto as a whole to move on. The tech is archaic and is cost prohibitive to use as intended. So much superior tech out right now, the future is exciting.

No one is perfect man. We all make mistakes. Despite this cult like sub here,  r/btc put out a good effort attempting to make it happen. It made alot of people gander to the other side and then the rug was pulled out.
Bad investing? Sure. But it could happen to anyone, don't rake someone over the coals who made a mistake and lost money. You are not the sum of one financial decision in your life. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:13
You must be young. This growth is not sustainable, can't lose money if you take profits. This run scares me, moving some of the gains into cheap alts. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:33
When everyone is getting greedy, it's time to be fearful. With this insane growth leading up the futures contract, starting to get a bad feeling the herd is getting led to slaughter. 
Obviously recommend holding if the event of a correction. But alot of newer people who bought in at $10k will sell in a panic. At which point I will buy more. However taking profits now is a wise decision and hedges your risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:38

I'm not going to equate Charlie Lee to Bernie Madoff but do you see how that's morally wrong? 
Equivalent to a CEO selling all their stock and telling shareholders "Keep holding you're going to be alright". It's wrong. No problem with selling your stack, but dont tell the idiots who follow you to keep propping up the price. It's manipulative and dishonest.

@_date: 2017-11-05 18:05:26
Because it's not profit until you sell out of your position. That's what gains are. 
It going moon to zero to moon means fuck all if you don't sell. Ya can't pay rent in bitcoin, fiat is still king no matter what this sub says. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:30:46
Why the animosity?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:21:08
I have a realized $20 gain from selling my widget, I have $120 in total proceeds.
The value of your widget is down 50%, however it is still one widget. You haven't "lost" anything yet except liquidity. If you think long term it will climb back to $1k, then I would tell you to ignore the current price. However there is an opportunity cost for your capital being tied up for 2 years. I can use my $120 to put in more investments and make more money. 
Investing and economics 101, timeframe and the price you enter and exit are the most important factors in terms of capital appreciation. It doesn't matter if my widget goes $100 -&gt; $2000 -&gt;$400, if I sell it for $400 I made a profit of $300. Even though at one point my widget was worth $2000 it's completely meaningless, I didn't have $1900 in profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:54:21
Okay let's do an example. 
We both buy one bitcoin each at $100. I sell mine for $120 the following week. I gain $20. 
 You hold, it soars to $1000 before crashing and stagnating at $50 for 2 years. 
What is the "profit"?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:07:52
That doesn't make sense. The widget you're holding has an underlying value. In this case, it's a very volatile one. It can be worth 0 today and $2000 tomorrow. But until you sell it, there is no gain - you still own the same one widget. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:28:01
Fuck both these subs 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:26:35
You don't think if crypto goes 100x in 5 years the IRS won't have the financial incentive to track down those who didn't pay their taxes? Theres gonna be a lot more crypto millionaires and billionaires in the coming years. They dont give a fuck about the $200 gains you made. IRS is here for the big money. 
From your post I can tell you've clearly never dealt with the IRS. If they audit you, they will turn your ass sideways. They will find it and you will pay 30%-70% taxes depending on how much of an asshole you were hiding it from them. 
Or pay your 15% LT capital gains and sleep easy at night. Giving a chunk of your own money is never fun however lets take a step back from the greed a little bit. You probably made monsterous gains you certainly could not have made anywhere else.  
We want crypto to be legitimate but at the same have zero regulation? Pay your taxes or don't cry when the IRS knocks on your door.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:00:08
WHEW! Since said it was safe it must be!
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:20:35
You're referring to cost basis. 
When I sell my coin I now have $7000 usd to go spend how I please. 
Bitcoin is rarely taken in the real world world. So you don't have $7000 usd to go spend it on things. After all bitcoin could be $4k tomorrow. I've sold my position so it doesn't matter to me. However to you it's significant. 
If I buy another coin for $7500, that is my new cost basis - what I paid for it. If I SELL for more than $7500, I have a realized gain. Until I sell it is worth nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:26:54

Right but mindless following, is well *mindless*. I understand the ideology of what you're saying, however it sounds like a bunch of kids talking about being anti-government in a dramatic, idealistic fashion.  
Where ever you align is completely irrelevant to me and the IRS. If you live in the US and don't pay taxes on your massive crypto gains, expect the IRS to come for your ass. Bottom line. We can all have these grand ideologies but we cannot ignore the reality of US tax law. When they find you (and they will), you will be alone, you will be scared, and they will make you pay dearly for trying to deceive them. They are smarter then you. 
Anyone who advocates not paying taxes is 1 a fucking idiot and 2 doing a public disservice that should be labeled as such. 
Edit: Go ahead and don't pay your taxes. Show the man how much of a bad ass you are. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:15:33
You're looking at it fundamentally incorrect. 
Is it a loss when your account value goes below your cost base?
During the dotcom bubble, stocks were soaring and everyone was getting rich. And then there was a popping of the bubble and subsequent sell off. Those accounts that were insanely "profitable" in your sense of it, soon became significant losses when people exited those positions. They would only be "profitable" if they sold for a gain. All that matters is the price you got in at and what you exited at - the "profit" in between that time period is pointless and unrealized. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:07:11
Great point. Thanks for the input. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:58:01
I am aware the way it is classified. As I said they don't give a shit about your $200. There is a big difference between you exchanging into alts from bitcoin and not reporting it because "you didn't know".  And you making $100,000 on a $2000 investment and don't pay any taxes. One is clear tax fraud and the other is a tax mistake. They will nail your ass to the wall for tax fraud. 
As far as the monero rebuttal, lol. You really think the IRS is stupid? Every exchange stamps your exchanges/purchases/redemptions, you're a fool if you think saying "Hey guys made some bad trades no more money, you can go home now" will make the IRS stop looking into you. 
They will get you and you are either arrogant or an idiot if you think they can't touch you when you don't pay your taxes. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:36:31

On the other hand, if a malicious actor gains access to your funds a bank will return the funds to you. Bitcoin you're shit out of luck if someone gets your private key or your exchange credentials. Putting all your money in something that can be taken without any methods of resolution is madness.

If the whole world were to use btc (lol), at 7 tx/sec, you'd get 2 transactions in your life time. The future of money lol
