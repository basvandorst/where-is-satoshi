If bandcamp comes across this thread, then absolutely, i'd love to have them accept BTC.

Any advice on executing the transaction? I'm thinking funds at start of escrow, liquidate amount needed to repay mortgage and transaction fees, keep profit in crypto.

It's great to see bureaucrats everywhere are so worth every penny they steal from us!

it'd make using bitcoin data in econ studies easier, more useful.

yeah, what nonsense. companies rejecting bitcoin ought to be laughed out of the market.

yeah of course it's possible to spoof location, but there should be some proxies that could give relative usage stats by region; maybe number of businesses accepting BTC? Exchanges also likely have customer data, but doubtful it'd be made public, even after anonymizing.

What about number of businesses that accept bitcoin by state? 
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:11:20
Awesome, thank you! The bitcoincharts.com link had raw data I could paste out into another file. Much appreciated! 
This is for a research project...

Gold and bitcoin have different payoff profiles, correlations with other assets, and risks, so it'd be better to look at them as complementary.

OMG! How can anyone consider doing anything not officially approved by a bureaucrat!?
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:14:44
so freaking brilliant it pains me to read!

exporting is fine, but not when bolstered by violently suppressing domestic purchasing power.

awesome post! we're at the start of a widely feasible, actually beneficial, "opt out" movement. rather than being forced into exile as a hermit, dissenters today can create awesome services and become wealthy helping others follow suit.
this is a truly exciting time to be alive!

should we rename it the Krugman rule?
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:54:05
the last century has showed the weakness of monopolistic governments: about a quarter billion people butchered and a few billion others impoverished. libertarians have never committed genocide, so they have a pretty big margin of error for running social experiments.

the US is one of the most aggressive nations in debasing their currency right now. the bernanke is just lucky as hell he can still dump it on an unsuspecting world.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:33:05
true, could be, but given India's destructive regulatory regime i look at it as more of a warning.
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:11:18
“The creation, trading or usage of VCs including Bitcoins, as a medium for payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority. No regulatory approvals, registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities.”

Krugman's so visionary that we should look at his dismissal of Bitcoin as the most bullish signal we've had so far!
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:01:33
that's a bad thing for parasitic monetary systems
