So your bank considers YOUR money as it's private property...great.

Are you answering your own question ? "WILL FAIL FOR SURE".... Says your crystal ball?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:54:54
And this even when only 0.5% Indians know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:41
People and mathematical logic. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:58
Nah people are not NAÏVE kids...we know what's happening. Fuck bcrash ...just use it to increase your btc thars all.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:36:21
It is a scam exchange holding mine and a lot of other users ripple hostage since 2 days while they manipulate prices 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:35:57
It's a trap...a scam exchange NEVER use it. I lost my ass on it many times
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:45:08
Trust on certainty of mathematics .
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:17:32
I withdrew everything just in time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:19:27
Not working shitcash mongers.....fool me twice and shame on me
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:17:27
I had same problem. After lots of tries I had to mail them and tell them the two amounts in it and they fixed it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:22:00
Yeah these people need to realise it's bitcoin being listed not shiitcoin trash...
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:07:49
Exactly.im expecting UpTo 7.5 k one last time then off to 15k
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:46:36
Why is it a conspiracy? 
Do you think we are fools?
1.try tomanipulate people by psychops.
2. Congest the network by malicious small payments.
3. Pump your shiitcoin deliberately to give us an impression that btcs blood is flowing into shiitcash.
4. Make fake IDs on social media to sell your shitty dream.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:05:29
I did for free on gdax since forever...
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:54:48
What???? Bitcoin cashhj is crashing??? Shall I sell everything I have before it hits ZERO???
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:16:28
Scarcity baby scarcity....more and more ppl want it daily.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:04:45
Coin mama uses credit card too
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:34
Breached it!!! I saw it happen wooooo hooooo
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:50:05
Lol people REALLY THINK shiitcash will not CORRECT after this pump?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:15:06
India 12000 usd already...
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:53:29
Because bitcoin transactions are taking forever due to spamming by miscreants....lol it's working against them. Coin base doesn't allow you to buy bch . Ppl usually buy btc first then send tgem to other exchanges to buy bch. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:34:26
People are surely going to vote for the coin of such market manipulators in future. Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:49:42
Butthurt right?? Bwhahahahahagahahahahaaaaa
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:37:08
11000 usd in India rn
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:45:47
Do you use gold to buy stuff? It's tractions include cumbersome paperwork...still why is it overvalued so much?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:54:04
Also remember "WHATEVER GOES UP ...COMES DOWN"
SHIITCASH has topped. The bubble will burst anytime now. Only a fool will invest at the top. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:22:48
Profitability is also decided by PRICE difference and Bitcoin will beat shitcoin by that alone when it goes to 10k soon and shitcoin goes back to sub 300 . You and your entire shiitcash team can go down like the Titanic forever and ever. And STAY DOWN.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:24:23
Who gives a FUCK? theyr better deal with us sanctions first lmao
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:29:21
Yes cash has maxed out...it's nearly doubled in a day ..that's what we call a PUMP and what follows immediately is a massive DUMP. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:48:20
These fools need to know that investing in a coin that nearly doubled overnight is asking for trouble. All these fools investing in shiitcash rn...they keep crying for correction if btc rises 10% in a day and here they are getting sucked into a scam. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:00:05
OK old hag
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:02:21
Well only if the rbi doesn't declare it illegal.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:08:24
Stop your "made in China" shitcoin from tanking first lol. It's not even breaching 1500 anytime soon in foreseeable future.
 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:12:09
It's all Chinese business ethics showing up. Old habits die hard. Just like China manipulates it's currency to gain competitiveness in export markets similarly this jihan would manipulate bcash to his own advantage in future to show investors of their money while he and his whales make the most.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:26:06
And...shiitcoin cash is not centralized? All of us are watching how manical and manipulative it's team is do you think people will trust that SHIITCOIN ever? If bitcoin dies the whole crytpo thing dies. People will just quit crypto for good 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:04:38
Turn that around to bitchcash guys....and ask them the same question . 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:07:13
Here comes fanboy of that psycho neanderthal....jihannn
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:48:11
Same prob here...assholes...
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:01:35
As the name suggests it's "shiitcash" so there's your answer. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:39:24
Oh cmon.....that'll be one ugly retarded king... yuck kkk.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:47:15
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:35:31
To the "use bch" guy....hardly any big exchange even lists that SHIITCOIN... How to use it then?why not use iota/ltc/xrp? When they do it cheaper and better than that shiitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:18:31
Oh it's going to plummet after big fat CME money comes in??? Salute to your foresightedness lmfaooo.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:56:45
Ahhhh ruined my day my making me look at shit personified.....awwww yuckkk
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:23:01
Did you know that people petitioned CME to list bitcoin NOT BANKS? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:55:13
But...but...it's the FUTURE!!!! :'(
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:55:34
6200 is very stiff resistance I don't think it will tank worse.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:58:53
Don't worry let's see where that dumb punk is and all his fanboys when CME finally lists bitcoin and ppl dump his shiitcoin in hordes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:18:53
Well Indian exchange has been 12000 usd since two days ...
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:11:32
Says the fanboy....of the coin that uses dirty tactics to get it's point across. If your coin is so good why did it need market manipulation to get it's point across? Why can't you just let the people decide fair and square ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:42:55
"IF".... That's a big If
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:53:08
Who is getting listed on CME?
Where will the WALLSTREET money enter?
It's not going to a shiitcash controlled from China.
Which coin is listed on all exchanges?
There answer to all above questions is answer to yours.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:23:19
He must be committed suicide by now
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:32:51
Yeah right....ALL OF A SUDDEN...one fine morning people realise bitcoin has a scalability issue...that very morning there is an army of whales dumping btc and pumping shiitcash simultaneously. And people all over social media carrying out psychops trying to force noobs to panic sell...yeah that's highly ethical.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:14:00
That would be utterly foolish....
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:00:56
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:28:51
Nice try.....bchhh punk.not working.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:41:05
Ha ha yeah I know HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:44:25
Was I supposed to laugh at that joke?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:01:38
India is not a city....I'm from India...
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:26:14
In India I'm trading at 9700usd rn
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:19:52
This attack will only generate hatred towards that shiitcoin. There will be massive retaliation mark my words. They will get it dirtier than they can handle. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:11:26
DONT sell ...buy more . Or regret like I have EVERY TIME.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:05:59
The thing is that idiot is hurting credibility of entire crypto because of his ego. Trying to spam network to flog transactions will hurt mass adoption than ever before. Ppl will always feel insecure now until lightening comes along.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:45:43
All these people saying this time is different blah blah. Do you think we're fools? Can't we see the same order size by bichh whales persistently providing a pump since two days ? If people were so unhappy with fork cancellation WHY DID BTC RISE? when fork was called off? All people selling right now will cry...CME will list BTC NOT the shiitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:20:06
Don't disappear  later Made in China. Substandard bot...remember me and what I said about your shitcoin....don't hide or run away if you've got balls.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:30:30
Who cares ? Lol. I just had to vent my anger on that egoistic maniac who if allowed to do this often will invite lawsuits from ppl or petitions by people who got burnt to sec to ban the whole crypto trading     
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:13:28
Wait for 1 Jan.....it will be dumped in the ugliest way possible. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:49:23
We need to fight back against this nanny behaviour by banks. They should be forced to act just as what they are FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:37:08
Overdue IMO...go for their alternatives like mewe etc
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:26:01

Fuck tax ...don't pay anything to that shit govt who allows assholes to run away with our mo ney

Fuck this small eyed cunt...I bet he's blind
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:11:11
FUCK CHINA....godamn that communist shithole
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:12:12
You need to go back to high school and learn about how DEMOCRACY WORKS..in the past and present the independent judiciary has been MORE THAN trigger happy to shoot down govt arbitrary laws. Look at what happened in South Korea. If everyone was to beleive in your philosophy of surrender India would still be under the British rule. What we could or could not achieve only time will tell. But I'm sure I'll put everything in the line to make yoy eat back your words.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:12:34
India is NOT CHINA. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:36:47
Moron I'm from India and that's utter bullshit. Our minister didn't say anything remotely as that. And even if he did we are a democracy infact world's largest democracy we will not allow such arbitrary action and drag the govt to court.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:43:33
That's an Indian 3rd world shithole newspaper.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:31:43
Fuck China....it can kiss my ass...no one gives a fuck. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:51:27
Yeah that's why he is taking his precious time out to write such lengthy essays here..oh the compassion of the saviour Christ lololol
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:25:09
Which country has called btc a legal tender yet? Which central bank prints btc? Stop spreading shitty fud.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:31:45
Moreover if what you said is true if there are too few Indians too matter in bitcoin market then WHY ARE YOU FUDDERS highlighting India ban so much ? If we are inconsequential then India ban shouldn't have any effect on btc markets .
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:49:51
Yeah I can sense that by the panicky appeals to sell everywhere lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:02:42
You dont loose anything if you don't sell. There is no guarantee that it will reach below 7.5k the rebound will be like a fucking storm. So if you havnt already sold at 10k it's too late to try now. Sellers are getting exhausted. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:06:56
Shut up asshole I'm from India and if our govt bans it well fuck our minister ass to mouth. THIS IS INDIAAAA AND WE WILL HODL TILL DEATH FUCKKK YOUR FIAT YEAHHHH
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:17:56
Well let's hope these FUDDERS assholes are not dumb enough to kill btc...they know too if they push it below a certain limit the people will go away from msrkrt and then they can put their fud up their asses and play pump and dump among each other.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:41:26
Related to ICOS....not bitcoin...so dont worry...
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:48:23
Fucking fudsters
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:23:36
Fuck this shit.. fudder assholes. I'm from India. It wasn't anything like this.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:49:22
Then leave this subreddit and never come back if you think this is the end.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:42:04
Anything affects markets because too many dumb noobs trigger happy to sell at a loss without applying brains...
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:18:30
We have to counter fud using power of social media to counter mainstream whore media
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:45:56
Ha ha sell so this PANICKY NOOB can rebuy..he can already sense the rebound and us sweating out of fear that hell have to rebuy at 11k because bitcoin jumps 4k in 10 mins when So many noobs are on sidelines to FOMO. Posts like THIS indicates that reversal is on horizon. Otherwise people CMON. Do you think this guy LOVES YOU? or is empathetic to your loss? Would he waste time trying to rescue all of us if the crypto market was really falling apart?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:36:02
Oh wow ! The old hag IS SMART
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:53:02
That is an opportunity for an alternative.to step in. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:31:14
And Indian news story isn't even anything remotely related to banning
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:02:54
I mean look at this morons ...looks...this lump of fat shit ? Would you guys take this monster seriously ?

Indian media is full of neanderthals...trust me ...fugly dumb retards become news anchors here by sucking off some minister.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:35
Media is in bed with politicians workdwide they have majority shareholding in media houses.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:33:08
When is the audit planned? BITFINEX fuckers must've made billions by now...out of their earnings they just need to arrange 2.2 billions...they can arrange that I'm sure. There is time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:26:47
I can smell the tears in their eyes lmao....their desperate attempt to make us sell now ..they're latching on to any news any fud . If they can't keep btc down for a day or two more....trust me they'll be buying back at 11k in 3 days. And cursing themselves and then end up becoming a hodler for future.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:17:42
We KNOW IT! NO ONE GIVES A FUCK.
