Nano is sub 5.5 right now. I'm not sure if you're aware, but that's like stealing at these prices.

Right, but if you assume it will be worth more tomorrow then today, why spend it? Save that stuff and get rich.

Or, you know, just being an exchange that has knowledge of short positions AND has allowed those shorts to operate on margin with nothing to stop you from painting the tape...

Even if we assume Bitcoin/Blockchain will change the world forever, Bitcoin isn't "the internet" in your example, bitcoin is just one "website".
It could be Amazon or it could be Pets.com, there's essentially no way to tell.

Whatever term you want to use to describe "What % of people know about BTC", I agree that number is at an all time high.
The problem is that while more people than ever *know* about BTC, few people seem interested in injecting new money into crypto. Something will have to change to draw new blood into the ecosystem or people will just continue to cash out.

A bunch of dudes invest a small amount and  borrowed a large amount from an exchange to bet that bitcoin would go down.
The exchange manipulated the price so it went up and kept the money those people invested.
When the place that tells you the price of something is also lending money with no oversight, you're gonna have a bad time.

Sort of, but not really.
The huge interest in BTC during the Q4 run up made much of the developed world aware of BTC. People's interest spiked and a *lot* of people poured money into it. Then, for whatever reason you opt to believe, the bubble popped and the price fell almost as dramatically as it rose.
Now, we're "post bubble" and waiting on the next bull run, but since BTC isn't like a stock or bond that has a functional return, the bull run will only happen when more new money comes back into the system and the demand for the coin increases. Right now, it's apparent that people are no longer in a hurry to put their money in, which means the demand for BTC is largely static and the price won't move much, save for those cliffs caused by bots.

Google trends track the frequency of google searches. So the graph is showing how often people, presumably that are unfamiliar with bitcoin, are trying to learn how to buy.
Since bitcoin still has a ways to go before being "grandma ready" in terms of ease-of-use, the lack of searches illustrates a lack of new money coming in. Worse yet, because the interest has been very high prior (obviously near the 19k peak) it's not unreasonable to assume that bitcoin is already well known to many, which wasn't the case pre-peak.
This is bad for bitcoin.

Fair question.
I think that sentence kind of *is* bitcoin in a way. It's an attempt at technical analysis that contains two errors in its first sentence.


*its (even worse, you get it right a few words later)


no need for the comma
Now English may not be your first language, which is fine, but when you're producing a paper/essay/whatever that's designed to explain why a new technology is going to take over, leaving in spelling errors might make one take you less seriously.

You *can*, but situations like this morning highlight the problem: the decentralized marketplace is actually very centralized. 
The exchanges are allowing people to short with ridiculously high leverage on margin (meaning they're borrowing from the exchange to do it).
Because the exchange has this info, the can inflate the price very rapidly (again, you saw this this morning) and cause those people who are borrowing to lose their money.
This is all contained and decided by the exchanges, so in reality, shooting BTC is essentially buying into a rigged game where the person with the power to decide whether you win or lose is also the one who's loaning you money. 
Tl;dr: do not short bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:10:38
This assumes an increase in BTC/Crypto popularity and interest. The trends right now don't support that.

That's your first sentence. C'mon man.
