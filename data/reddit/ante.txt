Started the node on the 24th of August and that day was the slowest since the connections were so few. Averaging about 3.9 GB in upload per day.

Are the actual coins at Trezor? What happens if their company shuts down? Or if their webpage/servers goes down for a few hours will my coins be stuck? Am I gambling all my coins on that Trezor keeps their business up and running?

Have about 50-80 live connections live 24/7.

If Trezor would go out of business. What would happen to our coins? Would they be stuck in limbo if your webpage doesn't work?

Ahh I see thought basically only Australia had a cap. We have caps for cellphone data though so the feeling of being capped isn't completely unfamiliar!
Sucks with cap :(
