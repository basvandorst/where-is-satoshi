I have had this issue in the past.  The last time it happened it ended up losing me money.  
Coinbase support pointed out that confirmation times are not guaranteed due to the mining process.  I provided detailed info to them explaining that my issue was with their transaction broadcast latency, not the confirmation time.  They simply re-iterated the irrelevant block confirmation time statement.
I expressed my concerns, withdrew my funds, and stopped the automatic buy schedule I had been using (replaced it with BitWage direct deposit for now).  The next time I need to buy something other than my normally scheduled amount, I will use Circle or someone else.

This is why we need more decentralized options like Bitsquare (  They just started their crowdfunding campaign on the Lighthouse decentralized crowdfunding platform (

Good to know.  It prevented me from completing a transaction.  Fortunately it is not time sensitive, but frustrating anyway.

Two minutes worth of research would have resulted in finding the [Fees and Limits link]( at the bottom of the [main page]( which clearly indicates the dormancy fee.

Per the post on bitcointalk, they did have 2FA enabled and someone allegedly bypassed it and still got into the account.

Not necessary. In my experience, the hardware works great and you can use it with other software (for instance Electrum or Mycelium, among others).

As many suggested, I prefer a combination of offline/online storage.  Copay is my wallet of choice - support for all platforms, multisig, hardware wallet integration (Trezor and Ledger), etc.  I also like Electrum.

No, the user will not be aware - see

Correct.  Simply that it does not currently.  The rest of that chain does seem to indicate that it will not though (

You can use a Ledger wallet with Electrum, Copay, or Mycelium (all open source) without using the Ledger Chrome extension (which is also open source).  That removes the necessity of trusting one particular vendor.  If you don't trust the hardware, I think you're stuck with either a cold storage solution or a complicated multisig setup.

Started converting to markdown - [Markdown version](  Still needs a lot of formatting work and is missing the images, but the content is there.

Good idea.  I forgot about that.  They switched over in v1.2.  Thanks for the feedback.

I'm not very familiar with markdown, but I'll look into it when I have some time.  I knew PDF wasn't an ideal format, but I wasn't convinced anyone other than me would ever look at it...

Added the version numbers into the document and started converting to markdown so it's easily viewable.  [Markdown version](

Glad you found it helpful.  I didn't cover the part about using a Ledger hardware wallet (or presumably a Trezor).  The derivation path Copay uses for it is actually different - m/48' instead of m/44', I think.  Confusing if you're not aware of it.

The website could definitely use work.  But after setup, I logged in about once every 6 months.  If you upload an xpub for a wallet dedicated to receiving funds, you really don't need to do anything beyond initial setup (unless you adjust distributions or something).

I did not realize they even had an app.  I also have used them for about a year and have had no issues.  I used to have an automatic weekly Coinbase buy and found it was much easier (and more secure) to just route it through BitWage.  Like the comment below, I had my bitcoin sent directly to a Ledger hardware wallet linked to Mycelium so I could view transactions.  
The exchange rate seemed a little high sometimes, but it was worth it for the convenience of not having to do anything (and having custody of the bitcoin immediately on conversion unlike what I was doing with Coinbase).

It sounds like you may have restored using the master public key instead of the seed phrase (the list of words - probably 12 - you would have written down when creating the wallet).  That would result in having a watching only wallet.
The Electrum developers are pretty responsive to issues submitted to Github also if you provide a sufficient amount of detail (  Only do that if you've already tried downloading the newest version and restoring from the seed phrase though.

Right :-)  As long as there's someone running a public Bitcore Wallet Service node, we're covered.
There are a few options I'm aware of:  and 
I'm playing around with some Python too in order to automate it a bit (although currently a lot of it is in a ridiculous spreadsheet).
