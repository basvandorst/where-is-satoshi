typical HYIP or ponzi, where they use the new people money to pay old people, if there is no new people, they will collapse

is this a scam? anyone try to buy one?
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:44:24
you could bring down the price to 50 buck each, then it trigger the chain reaction and might oversold down to 10 buck each
