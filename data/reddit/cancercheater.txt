Not *always* the case. I buy bit coin from people all the time through PayPal. Just bought $3,400 from a redditor last week. I have 2k+ feedback on LBC. Just have to be careful.

Okay, so to clear things up [this]( image is how much money has been printed by the government? I read the labels on both the X and Y axis, but how would I be able to come to that conclusion? Is it just something I should know?
Thanks for the ELI5.
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:11:33
Can you ~~ELI10~~ ELI5? I was feeling optimistic about my ability to understand for a slight moment there.

I think our results, one way or another have nothing to do with the possibility of yours. Do a good bit of reading on bitcoin,  the risk, and if that's worth the possible reward. Just because some have made a lot, (investing early, day trading) doesn't guarantee your results. It could crash tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:37:36
I laugh, because I fear it is true.
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:50:35
Haha, it is *okay*. I know other people don't know my situation, but between October last year, and today, I went from almost being homeless, to filing bankruptcy, getting a full time job (and have an interview, today for a new job), having a savings that will float me for 6+ months, being ahead on all my bills, and paying for my car in all cash just over a month ago. All thanks to a user in this sub who gave me 2 bitcoin to buy clothes for interviews, and then finding a way to make a very good bit of money with bitcoin (my current job pays minimum wage and doesn't even cover the few bills I have).
Edit: I forgot, I'm back in college, too.

Laws for each state about buying and selling bitcoin locally and online. Do I need to get a money transmitting license in CT? I think that a lot of people don't consider the laws. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:07:50
Rigor mortis. BTC got a slight election this morning. Only feasible option. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:06:21
Coming from someone who once had their suicide planned out, I (and I'm only speaking for myself) wouldn't listen to anything anyone had to say, because somehow in my head, my situation was *so* much worse than their situation could ever be. 
It was definitely a pity party for one for a long time. 
Long story short, my mother unknowingly saved me from the day I had planned by finally helping me to see someone.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:44:33
"Every time I come around your city, bitcoin." - that was the part that got me.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:32:20
I got a down vote, I don't know what else of a final update I can give.
I've lost 65 pounds, finally landed a job, paying all my bills and taking care of my depression and anxiety. Next is getting bankruptcy taken care of, and get a car. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:43:57


How is it a misdirection? That's an answer to his question. Trading locally is fairly safe. Taking precautions will avoid scams. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:11:51
Hey, hey, "lost". ;)
Just kidding, I'm curious as to what's found out.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:25:23
I've used gyft numerous times. It is a quick and seamless transaction each time. You get the cards immediately after paying.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:57:23
Sue them. No, they don't deserve a bailout because of what they've done. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:34:35
I'm confused why other people should fund the stupidity of other people. It wasn't like Mt.Gox up and disappeared with no signs. Ever since I got into bitcoin there were issues with Mt.Gox. Anyone who did any reading on bitcoin before investing would have known this. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:36:57
Then people would search for .dat files if they already feel you have bitcoin. If we're a "bad guy" I wouldn't mind going through every .dat file if I knew you had a few BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:55:53
When it started to really go up in price, and I realized I had no money to invest. I knew it would be successful just for that reason. That's my luck. Haha
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:29:44
I only have .38 btc, and I have been a member of this community for many months. I started looking into it when BTC was at $200, then watched it rise. The community was fantastic then. Ever since the bubble burst, the quality of the community has gone down. It is sad. :( 
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:00:43
Read my post history; you'll quickly see the relevance. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:40:48
It is good, yes, but offline is always the safest. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:25:41
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:50:14
It is all about perspective. At least you had 202 btc to lose. I don't have any because I can't afford any. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:00:23
I haven't watched your link, but I've had dinner with him (mutual friend) and he was a great guy then. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:13:35
I completely agree. Also, is a tiny portion of the bitcoin community as a whole, where statistically speaking, redditors don't make the average imcome, but instead, below average. So I can see a lot of negativity coming from people who have lost what little they had. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:09:46
Some of the online ways through localbitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:09:30
I have a very small amount of bitcoin,  and no disposable income, but I'm excited for the time where I can invest in bitcoin. I see endless opportunities with bitcoin and for new avenues for businesses. I'm hoping my life changes quickly enough so I can take advantage of it all. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:46:45
I'm serious when I ask if you truly believe it is mixed press, currently? Anyone that I know that isn't into bitcoin only hears bad (and inaccurate) news in the headlines.

"... you know, people who make also mistakes ..." 
Perfectly placed? Or irony?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:29:41
Erm... that's what he said?
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:59:48
Details in an e-mail that didn't have 2FA enabled that they were able to get access to, and able to change things around?
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:05:48
Thanks for the link, everything I was coming across was saying any transaction from currency to currency would require a license (include virtual).
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:00:30
Loose lips sink ships.
Yes, I agree. There have been some that talk about paying off their student loans, or buying a car with their BTC, but the people who made truly large amounts of money keep that private.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:25:03
They might have been able to change the settings or put in a support ticket to disable it, then add it to their phone for Google Auth? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:42:58
Can confirm - Beanie Baby hoarder here. I'm only keeping them for sentimental value. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:57:01
Agreed. I hope bitcoin continues to succeed but I won't be surprised if it paves the road for another, either. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:20:09
I just canceled my largest transaction because he had a bit more to sell. Now I'm worried he's going to go to sleep before it comes back up. :( 
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:38:52
The only correct answer here is to hire a lawyer.
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:05:08
I thought the threshold was $10,000, and another user provided a link. Everything I was reading was that I would need to register for a money transmitting license for any amount. I'll just make sure to keep it under $10,000 (not that I will be even close to that anytime soon). 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:01:54
What's considered a large amount of transactions? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:30:47
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:59:27
I have a tiny bit of BTC that I've been trying to sell on localbitcoins for a couple weeks now. I have the lowest sell order for local meet ups, and 4 feedback yet no one is jumping.
How did you get the ball rolling?
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:08:49
I have .35 BTC right now. I was hoping by trading through localbitcoins I could slowly grow that number. I live in a major city, which I figured would be to my advantage. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:17:55
Because bitcoin is in its infancy stage. It will be a long while before it stabilizes. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:15:45
That was the first thing I read, and if I interpreted it correctly, then I would need a license no matter how much. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 00:35:32
As a person who sells on LBC, you just have to know what to look for. There is a lot of scamming. You quickly find out how not to get scammed, though. Cash meet up is always the best though. Trading with a pro trader is always a good idea, too. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:06:24
I figured my small amount (.3) might be a factor. I constantly stay logged in for the exact reason you mentioned. I posted a Craigslist ad as well. 
Back to the drawing board, I suppose. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:02:03
I personally don't know of any decent sized communities besides here, and bitcointalk. When I meant community, I meant everyone who has some sort of invested interest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:49:49
Prices are insane. 


Which is it? 100% silver, or sterling?
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:19:40
I planned on doing both, but if I have to buy from coinbase exclusively, to avoid ridiculous licensing, then I would consider it.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:36:08
That is the furthest thing that I'm looking for. I'm looking to become legitimate. I have a lot of IT departments who are looking to buy because of cryptolocker, and they pay with business checks.
I genuinely want to be legitimate, and be a good name amongst the Bitcoin community. Not another person not following the laws with regards to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:04:39
I get them as I go along. 
But, since there is no regulations in most states regarding bitcoin, do I need to have a money transmitting license? I know I have to register with FinCEN.
