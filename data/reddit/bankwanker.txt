On the back of this I know entrepreneurs that started out calling them selves the "branch manager" or "regional manner" and not "owner" or "CEO."
Gave the impression it wasn't a one man band.

I don't need to be told.

**Whilst what I'm about to paste to you is not applicable in this situation as it is UK law/statutes etc. The USA and other legal systems will implement very similar laws. This is a copy of decisions made in court, that outlines (as far as I am aware) the current judicial precedent on ownership, possession and control: Pay p**
Belonging to Another
•	Ownership, possession and control.
•	S.5 (3) – Obligation to deal with property in a specific way.
•	S.5 (4) – Property received by mistake.
Property belongs to another when it is under the ownership, possession or control of another person. The owner of the property will usually have all of these unless he has suspended his rights of ownership. Whether or not property is belonging to another is a matter of fact for the jury to decide.
**Turner:** d. left his car at a garage for repairs upon the agreement that he would pay for the repairs on collection of the vehicle, as soon as the work had been carried out, during the night the d. collected the car with the spare key and was convicted of theft. The car was in the possession and control of the garage at the material time hence it was considered the property belonging to another.
**S.5 (3) – legal obligation to deal with property in a specific way.**
Where property (usually money) is handed to another on the basis that d. will deal with the property in a particular way (a legal obligation) it is still considered as being property belonging to the original owner.
For example, where a workman asks his client for money to buy materials, the money is considered to be property belonging to another as the money was handed over for a particular purpose. However, if the workman simply requests a £100 deposit or a part payment for the work then he would not become liable for theft even if the work was not carried out.
**Davidge v Bennet:** the d. was given money by his flatmates in order to pay a household gas bill. However, the d. spent the money on a Christmas present and was charged with theft. It was held that the money had been given to him for a specific purpose and therefor there was a specific obligation to settle the bill. The money was property belonging to another and hence the d. was convicted of theft.
**Hall:** the d. was a travel agent who accepted deposits for some flights to America. Money was paid into the general business account before the flights were booked and then the company went into liquidation. The d. was not held liable for theft as there was no legal obligation to deal with the money in any particular way; indeed it was a just a security against the client cancelling. The money was not considered property belonging to another and hence the d. was not liable for theft.
**Wain:** the d. raised almost £3000 for a televised charity but spent the money and sent a worthless cheque to the charity. The d. was held liable for theft as he had a legal obligation to pay the proceeds to the charity and when this did not occur he had stolen the property belonging to another.

I did quickly exploit the price difference through ready to trade channels...
I just couldn't get the money out the other side.
I accept, my scheme failed. I do not accept I failed at arbitrage.
Edit: find me a definition of arbitrage that actually states you have to end up with the funds at the end. You won't because the definition doesn't go that far. It is merely the buying and selling of assets at an advantageous price.

That's incorrect. There is an acute difference between possession and ownership. Although as the saying goes, "possession is nine tenths of the law."
If I lend you my car, you possess the car, but you don't own it.

Either he's a troll. Or an idiot. Either way. He's an idiot.

And never will. It would have caused a severe strain on our relationship. All for a quick buck. Not worth it.

Or more of my own money in the future. Has definitely been a learning curve.

I think his comment was aimed at me. And in answer to your previous question, yes I am leaving BitCoin for good. But I am not leaving crypto for good.

Huge. I'd actually accepted I was going to lose at one point. What's worse was I was meant to be saving for a deposit for house. WITH my girlfriend. She doesn't know. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:52:04
I don't understand how your example is relevant.
Ownership and possession are completely different from one another.
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:49:27
Please see me comment below, you are wrong.

I'm not sure if you read the post in full or not...
I'd say I succeeded in arbitrage. I took advantage of a price on one market compared to the other. I just failed to withdraw my money. The reason I was able to take advantage of the price difference however, was DUE to the fact I couldn't withdraw the money.
You make it sound like someone else COULD have succeeded. Find me a man that could get round Gox withdrawal blocks, please do, because I think he's the man that thousand have been looking for for the last couple of weeks.

I don't understand why people is in inverted quotations. As if, they're not human because they disagree with your opinion.

I didn't think I was gambling. I saw a sure profit. How wrong was I.

I completely agree with you. I thought I had a solid plan. If anything I want this to go out as a message that no matter how confident you are. If it's seems too good to be true. It probably is. I fucked up. And nearly paid for it. I was an idiot.
