It seems like alts have greater volatility. Whenever money flows into crypto alts go up more. When money flows out alts go down more. So it btc is up by end of year, it’s dominance will probably go down. Sudden spikes or drops shouldn’t be focused on because there is a rebalancing that occurs for a few days following those sudden changes.

At least for 2018 so far, becoming a millionaire buying bitcoin has worked the same way as becoming a millionaire by fishing. Start out as a billionaire.

Bitcoin is the best thing since sliced white paper.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:37:34
It already has over $7000 worth of bitcoin from various addresses.
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:48:08
That’s what I’m counting on! :)
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:13:30
The article was dated today but says bitcoin is trading around $9500 currently. Something very off about the article.
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:41:53
What if q4 if 2007 made so many of us go all in and so most of the money is already in and so there isn’t another chunk of money to move in at this point? I’d love to be wrong!

I remember those days. And to top it off, the modem shared a landline with our phone and an incoming call would interrupt it and kick you off the internet lol.

Bitcoin is not the same as Coinbase. If you are talking about privacy and control you are not talking about Coinbase. Coinbase is centralized.

It depends. They don’t always give you the best exchange rate so there is usually a hidden cost due to the spread.
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:51:47
I agree. No one cares about what games can be played on it. We care about the safety of our crypto. Btw, is there an official page on fb?
@_date: 2018-08-30 19:17:15
I’ll do a two for one special and sell some bitcoin for $400,000. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:40:15
It is a scam site.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:32:30
Coinbase already has control of your keys. You only have full control of the keys of Bitcoin you hold off of a centralized exchange. Just keep what you need for trading and spending on that site. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:03:45
I hope so! I’m ALL in. I’m counting on it lol.

There has been an ongoing security related debate going on via twitter feeds about this wallet. You might want to check it out. I like it and as long as you maintain possession of your device the security threats should be ok. It is basically a brain wallet that looks and feels like a hard wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:06:05
As long as I keep a minimal viable portion of it for breathing and checking this seconds bitcoin price.
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:07:43
As long as I keep a minimal viable portion for breathing and  constantly checking the current bitcoin price.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:52:30
Let us make it happen! I’ll buy your bitcoin at that price for a limited time only.

Does that mean it’s time to mortgage vital organs and go all in?
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:43:01
Good point and good question. I am curious about your country. Are there holds or bank enforced delays in releasing funds? If you transfer from bank a to b, how long before the funds are available to transfer again? Here each such step can add additional days. Banks have engineered ways to increase their float on individual money. With crypto, you can bypass artificially placed holds on capital.

Nice tie in to bitcoin. I’m not retiring as soon as I had thought in December of 2017 lol.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:09:50
Halvening has nothing to do with predicting a price drop. There is such a thing btw as it has already happened more than once as the original block reward was 50btc and now it is 12.5.
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:36:23
This is better than I thought It was going conversationally speaking. I anticipated something along the lines of a F=MA calculation that takes into account the maximum probable bone density/bone strength to estimate a necessary force of impact in case they wanted to know how high to jump and so forth. Or which otc blood thinners to take along with the arterial anatomy of the wrist. Or a reminder that CO binds more strongly to hemoglobin than O2 and so interrupts normal respiratory processes.
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:33:21
I agree but it gives a somewhat better alternative to fb.
@_date: 2018-08-02 03:17:16
Which would make it walletception.

Long Live Bitcoin!!!

There is more than one herd. And humans don’t know the future with certainty. I hold because I believe in the ideas coded into it not because I know for sure whether or not the market valuation will move in my favor in the immediate future.

Of course! Doesn’t it say in the vows: “ to have AND to hodl”?

It looks like they are still developing it so it may not be available yet.

Bitcoin price watching every few seconds is itself a form of bc.

The statists have a few thousand years up on us. We can do our best to profit in our lifetimes but the struggle for individual rights and freedom will always be needed. We will never win so fully that we can relax from that struggle. Bitcoin is awesome but it is more like the Mayflower than the final destination.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:40:40
I’m picturing a Bretton Woods 2 arrangement in which nations agree to peg their fiat to bitcoin. Each nation purchasing for its sovereign wealth fund a sufficient amount of bitcoin to back up its fiat supply.
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:23:28
It was the wrong address?! Or what if?
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:55:06
But to bottom line your point, if you are arguing for a full audit of the fed, I concur.
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:04:55
Sometimes. But sometimes, thingshappened.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:22:35
If at some point the mining influence allowed nation states to fundamentally alter the properties of bitcoin that pro freedom pro privacy individuals value, we could always exit to another crypto that has our desired properties.

Yeah!! I have to transfer in several smaller amounts because of a fear of a mistake.

I had same problem trying to buy a book from the Mises Institute. Their use of Bitpay made it not work for me.

The last time I remember these sorts of reversals was just prior to the financial crisis of 2008. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:02:48
The incentive would be for each individual or company that can afford it or each sovereign state to be able to independently verify the ledger so that too much miner influence isn’t concentrated in a competing state. The bitcoin generated is just to incentivize the bootstrapping of bitcoin. In the long run, the value of decentralization of trust will maintain it.

It is a quarterly report now not monthly. They are probably finishing up the one that will be for May. They have all July and August before they have to begin to work on next one for end of August.

Roughly 400 mil. Not bad!

I agree with you and think of them as an individual.
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:45:28
I wouldn’t advertise though. The feds May argue the commerce clause applied to crypto purchases and ignore that you are buying instate.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:20:40
I think it would and yes.
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:19:05
Yeah I was wondering the same thing. It is hard to believe that no one would take the silver.

So perhaps that wasn’t the target audience for discussing the nuances of decentralized blockchain technology.
