Where can I restore my Wallet if Breadwallet stops exist?
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:51:17
Hm that sounds pretty risky to me for long time storage.
If I just do it and in lets say 10 years there is no wallet with the same structure anymore i am fucked?

ok thank u :)

but why can i restore a wallet in mycelium with my breadwallet passphrase?
i thought there are 2 options:
1. i enter my phrase and mycelium says: invalide or something like this
2. i enter my phrase and it restores my wallet with mit btcs on it
but what happend: i got an empty wallet that does not make sense to me

oh awesome so my thoughts are quite good :D
thanks for the answer, i think i will do it this way.

yeah this seems quite logical to me but i still dont get why i can restore another wallet in another app with my passphrase from breadwallet, but its not the same wallet as shown in breadwallet.

hm maybe its not the same protocol
first i had breadwallet, now i downloaded mycelium and tried to restore with the same key but its empty, still he restored something its no a new one i dont know why^^

my thoughts are that maybe there is anyone with the same key as me in breadwallet but on BIP44 and this would be a serious security issue
but maybe im wrong cause i dont have a deep understanding for the different protocols, im new to bitcoins in general
