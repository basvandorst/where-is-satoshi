Feels like a dumb question but does this increase the amount of data that is applied onto a block?
@_date: 2018-10-31 04:16:02
I feel like also being part of the movement is not being a fuckface trader selling this stuff for fucking fiat. Burn the goddamn traders!

When bitcoin has “private” transactions, it will be the biggest middle fingers to the government, and I will be so happy! 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:17:22
Bitcoin really is about making smarter people rich isn’t it? Lol

This is not how markets work. Dear god!

That's why I'm hodling to zero hahaha
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:00:45
Funfact there’s never been something like bitcoin before... it goes through bubbles, as all things do, but to compare it to other assets is a premature because of its short existence.

@_date: 2018-11-25 06:42:34
I think you’re underestimating the stupidty of most of the people in the world and much of the people in this market. Fuck if they know how this thing works. They just see the price go down this much for the first experience and don’t think for themselves and sell it. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:00:20
Maybe I’m wrong but doesn’t betting on price influence market price of bitcoin?

Dumb comment. Know the tech before you spew ignorance on here.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:58:00
Yes this is how it works. If people are willing to sell it more than buy. Then buyer can set their price and sellers don’t care because they are panicking imbeciles. Hence, price falls quickly. There’s not a whole lot of liquidity in this market ESPECIALLY on weekends because we are having a day off lol
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:19:34
Woops! I thought it was the Twitter handle. My bad!
@_date: 2018-11-24 04:15:50
They also likely need more clarity from the SEC on what these altcoins are legally i.e. securities 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:40:26
You know if this bitcoin thing does take off governments can collapse, anarchy can assume control, and you can show ingrid all those bitcoins u got.
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:41:00
Cuz ponzi. Anyway you want the real answer? Do a lot of research on modern fiat and debt based society, store of value, the history of money, bitcoin’s real tech, and it’s parallels to gold.

As much as like your enthusiasm, get rich quickers tend not to get rich quick. They often times lose. Take 1% of that $300K and put it in bitcoin... then with that 99% SHORT THE FUCK OUT OF ALL THE BANKS MOFO!!!!

YOU USE BITCOIN. What happens after I send it, I really don't care. The reality is we still live in a fiat world.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:05:26
How is it possible that people who don’t own a product can essentially demand what the price is when they don’t own said product. What we have is a place to make bets without underlying ownership of the asset when it’s very easy to have and transfer ownershipof the asset. It’s a betting market not a place to have market price influenced. I’m having a hard time understanding how this is thing became legal...
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:41:02
I like to think that, but I also have strong doubt in many of the people in this market. Most of them don't understand the potential of this or its tech. They are in it for a quick buck so I don't trust in the intelligence of most investors in this market. Dumb money is being shaken out still because people told them hodl, they didn't believe it when price fell below $6000, and think the market is done or that they can bitcoin at a cheaper price.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:06:39

Don’t they promote bitcoin cash? Not bitcoin. Just wondering. It’s why I haven’t followed them.

Got damn! I’m getting a hard on!
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:00:59
Great mindset so I should assume you own some Bitcoin, right?

Dude, this is about giving Bitcoin legitimacy... A government of The United States is saying this is money aka a form of payment! Wake up! Shit doesn't happen over night...

Theoretically large transactions will occur on mainchain while smaller more frequent and common transactions will occur on higher layer solutions such as lightening. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:08:56
I thing projects will but not tokens... Why do I need to buy your stupid token to access your platform??? Let me pay a fee or whatever! This reason makes me thing that these damn tokens are scams!!
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:14:02
There will be a tipping point for currencies, hence why bitcoin is a blackhole. At bitcoin’s current growth even with diminished returns, at a certain price it will suck up everything and destroy everything because it’s the most superior form of money ever created.
@_date: 2018-11-07 21:41:22
Yet this guy still created a scam coin and tells people to buy bitcoin before they buy his junk.

You should be saying this when we are in a bull market�� people too bitter and love to brag about the stick up their ass on this thing.

Yup yup. Money movies from the poor and stupid to the rich or intelligent.
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:45:55
DISAGRRE TO THE HIGHEST ORDER. Higher price means more economic mass and the ability to have power... Higher Price is what it needs to fulfill its purpose. It's a blackhole because it's the hardest money ever created. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 04:05:24
I think I know the answer, but I just wanted to know if there's something I may have missed. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:51:04
I am aware of this. Another question I have is since the amount of hashing that is occurring has gone up, does the amount of money it takes to mine a bitcoin increase? So the amount of money it takes to mine a bitcoin has increased compared to say last year?
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:14:44
Love it lmao 
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:31:52
Holy shit this was impressively well thought out response and no what I expected to read. You are a true Bitcoiner and have gotten in for the right reasons! Cheers!

Lmao fed coin... what a fucking joke. Fed coin going to have universal control of your money.

The question posed was related to Bitcoin taking over. Bitcoin fails to be a little technology toll as you state if it provides financial sovereignty. It lets user give a choice to what they do with their money. How can there be a poll tax as you suggest if someone can easily claim to not have Bitcoin and you cannot prove that said person does have bitcoin? (This is assuming Bitcoin does have the privacy that many involved with Bitcoin desire in the futre)
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:54:05
Ever thought of taking one year off from looking at the price? This thing’s either going to 0 or TO THE MOOOOOOON!! *WHOOSH* *peew* *boughh* that’s my impersonation of my rocket taking off
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:44:21
I’m under the mindset that it’s the rich that will eventually flock to Bitcoin and then the “sheeple”... such is life

@_date: 2018-12-05 18:37:49
This is what I’m hoping for with many of the traders of this thing. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:02:47
"We will pay taxes but with BTC"
How do you collect taxes if Bitcoin is private and there's no central mechanism to ensure that collection? Also, without knowing how much Bitcoin an individual owns there's no secure way to know how much everybody owes in taxes.

I don’t understand how bitcoin is populist. It seems more about general awareness to how the current financial structure works in today’s world and how it’s setup to fuck over the commoners. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:30:58
Gold and Silver are highly visible and hard to transport objects. This is a couple reasons why they struggle as money. Bitcoin being digital means it can be  easily moved around. It is also much harder to store gold compared to Bitcoin. These two reasons propose that it is easier to hide the money and only the owner of the Bitcoins know their entire balance. Billions of dollars are laundered in Swiss Bank accounts all to avoid taxes. Mainly only the rich are able to do this. Now since Bitcoin acts like a Swiss bank account everyone in the world will essentially have a Swiss bank account in their phones or any other hardware. What do you think the everyday person would do if they were suddenly given a Swiss bank account?
