GBTC is over the counter, so it's not an iron clad investment in any sense.   
   
That said, there can be some gains to be had if you follow the premium.     
   
GBTC's premiums have come down to close to 1 or 2% in the past but for the most part they have been in the 18-22% range for the past 6 months.  But in the past week and a half we've found a "new normal" where GBTC is tracking fairly steadily at a 46% premium.    
   
In my opinion, when BTC levels off or drops a bit for a few days I expect the GBTC premiums to fall back down to the 20% premium range.  Buy GBTC then, not now.

GBTC was at a 14% premium 2 days ago, down from an almost 100% premium a month or so ago.    
   
The last time the market yanked GBTS's premium it was when they thought the Winklevoss etf might go through.  When it didn't, GBTC spiked from a 0% premium back up to a 50% premium in a matter of days.    
     
I say all of this to indicate that Wall Street seems to be hedging that BTC (and thus GBTC) will fall.

Steve Jobs was a piece of shit, Woz is a technical mastermind.  
   
Woz only had less influence on the company in later years because he had fewer share of it because he gave much of his stock away to the AAPL employees who he thought were getting screwed over by Jobs.   
   
Fuck Steve Jobs, I'm glad that asshole is rotting in his grave.
