Well first their CEO isn't continuously talking how bitcoin is not going to succeed like he wants it to fail . But yet that's what made them Bitcoin. And is trying to pump some other coins I believe he was all over ethereum when it was doing good and bashing bitcoin. So fuck Coinbase and CEO I hope the get hacked and force to close so he won't  be in Bitcoin no more !

@_date: 2017-01-03 04:52:13
He basically bashed bitcoin and praised ethereum nothing wrong with praising another crypto but atleast don't bash bitcoin in the process plus bitcoin is what made Coinbase he's not too bright for that or he has some type of agenda against bitcoin.Plus he said he didn't believe bitcoin would succeed and  that ethereum would.

@_date: 2016-12-29 18:05:12
Yes but if its centralized controlled by an entity is it still blockchain ? I don't think so bitcoin on the other hand is for the people by the people decentralized that's more like blockchain technology  in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:50:26

One million dollars  "Dr Evil"
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:52:55
Yes Trezor hardware wallet possibly the largest amount of  bitcoin stored with so really safe.a bit expensive $100 not really if u have large amount of bitcoins and would like to have them secure. There's another hardware wallet also cheaper look it up its on the guide on front page I believe . And make sure you back up your wallet and add a passphrase.in case u loose your Trezor the back up is all you need and can recover your bitcoins. It's a list of 24 words plus your passphrase if you choose to add.never loose those 24 word list store somewhere safe and don't forget passphrase because it's all over if you do.
@_date: 2016-12-24 10:35:49

@_date: 2016-12-30 02:03:38
It boggles me how people would not be able to secure their own money! It's your hard earn money and yet you can't keep up with a simple task never lose your 24 word seed and keep safe. How hard is that not at all I guess some get It some don't .
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:38:25

Well from your point of view then, Bitcoin did  start from a very humble beginning worth = nothing, 0, zip ,nada in 2009...fast forward 7 years $950 or so that's a terrible way to put it for you non believers. �� 
@_date: 2016-12-21 04:54:04
I don't know why your friends would not use a reputable source to  get coins like libertyx,bitcoin atm, bitquick, those options are if you don't want to use an exchange.

@_date: 2016-12-29 02:48:35
You store them in a safe environment never store them in your pc.Ill  skip all the other options not to good at explaining just but a hardware wallet Trezor. Is a good option several other hardware wallets. But if you want to store small amounts of Bitcoin you can store it on Mycelium Android phone ...Breadwallet on IOS .. read the guide in front page has more info
