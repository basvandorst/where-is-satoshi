Moving it is simple and free yes, but let’s see if withdrawing issue still happens
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:51:57
Sure, open up gdax and login, and select deposit. It should give you an address. Copy that address. Go into coinbase and select withdraw. Paste that address.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:45:42
Alright will do, thank you for responding!
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:05:52
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:14:46
Have you tried moving it from gdax instead?
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:11:38
Buy from gdax, not coinbase. Your info will transfer because gdax is owned by coinbase. The fees will be much much lower

Norton blocked it for me as a heuristic virus?
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:53:08
Also are you sure it’s not an issue with your bank? I just reread your post and your bank may have a minimum deposit
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:12:15
Also, have you tried from a computer? Could be an issue with the app
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:06:08
Just found this:

I think you can not get as many taxes taken if you take a loss. I am not sure though so dont quote me
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:53:54
Ahh so I wonder what people are so concerned about.. two rules of trading i stick to:
Dont trade with emotion.
History repeats itself.
PS - the shillers seem to be winning because as bitcoins sell volume increases, bch buy volume increases (could this say people are scared by the shillers and moving into bch?)

Someone who charts and understands technicals, nice to meet you, i see few here in cryptoland
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:03:05
It’s used in technical analysis by traders and referred to as potential support/resistance because it’s so widely respected
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:03:40
I have personally never used it but I have heard other users comment the same site for countries having trouble purchasing
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:42:32
For some reason December 18 seems familiar, but I could be wrong
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:11:15
It’s a lot to explain over a comment, but I can give you a few tips and terms to look into. They all start with candlesticks
1) learn how to draw trendlines for support and resistance (youtube)
2) learn about the different moving averages(focus on simple moving average over exponential to start) 50MA and 200MA are good ones to have on charts. (Investopedia or youtube)
3) learn about the RSI (relative strength index) and what it means to be oversold or overbought (youtube or investopedia)
If you would like to present your newfound knowledge to make sure you understand it or have more questions, feel free to message me, I am always willing to help new investors!
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:11:40
Haha thanks but this was not my reference!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:48:10
Ohh got it, so if they require verification, they most likely send your tax docs?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:43:49
When it gets to you, put it in a wallet to be safe, like electrum. Of course you can research other wallets too
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:25:14
Check my most recent post, i uploaded a daily chart
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:25:44
I also notice each pullback/correction is slightly larger than the recent (due to more noobs worried about losing money)
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:03:01
Could you explain this to me please?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:54:28
If we hit 10k we would break the 50MA on the daily, which would be disastrous. Every test on the 50MA on the daily, we have seen a rebound. The 50MA is currently at 11.1k
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:34:44
Left gdax and coinbase for poloniex. I didn’t like coinbase from the beginning, since they always charged higher than market and sold lower than the market. Poloniex has given me zero issues so far and it reminds me more of a trading platform (i use think or swim for trading stocks)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:00:55
Thanks, that’s why i kind of figured the 3 and 4 hour MA’s wouldn’t hold. Appreciate your input
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:44:35
Try Localbitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:41:19
What lambo?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:57:04
Big banks are coming in
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:17
Holding 13.5k area right now. Keeping an eye out if this is bottom
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:26:25
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:18
I think this time will be different based off of all the hype around it right now, posting a chart soon, identifies possible support levels for a reversal to the upside
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:52
It’s just kind of frustrating to see everyone in a frenzy when this drops. It really shows a lack of knowledge in bull trends. Btw burpcoin is a very interesting name haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:41:57
Ltc dying, creator sold all
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:34:10
After some digging, I can only find the hours they’ll be trading once they start, but I cannot find when they start, maybe market open tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:53
That $100 bil coming out does worry me a little due to the fact that other bitcoin price corrections have not seen that high of a cap decrease. I personally believe in XRP over any other coin so most of my money is in there. I guess only time will tell. Bitcoin’s dip is about a 30% drop which has been the standard correction percent for every correction so that provides some sense of relief, but like i said, time will tell
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:56:36
To the top also I’m going to vote this guy. Comments priceless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:59:28
Moving average, average stock price over X days
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:47:09
Is that what happened here, was the difficulty adjusted recently?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:37
I know, I’m just trying to offer my insight as to where we could potentially see a reversal to the upside occur
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:49:57
I think you misread my question
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:47:11
Are you more interested in an exchange or charting software? Charting software I’d recommend Tradingview (btcusd, ethusd, etc) but for a combo of exchange and charting with data, i like to watch bitstamp, however I have never traded on bitstamp as I am still unverified. So the exchange is use now is Poloniex, but i dont use their charts
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:35:14
Same haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:51:25
Do you accept XRP by chance?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:41
Gdax is fine for new traders, but for more experienced, it’s awful in terms of indicators and resizing, jmho.
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:23:33
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:26:22
Nah correction, couple thousand drop was necessary, normal at this point to see
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:28:23
A little misleading. 
Buffett doesn’t invest because there is no cash flow in it for him. He buys businesses on the premise of getting his money back through cash flows. There is no cash flow here, only the end game of to the moon which he is okay missing out on
