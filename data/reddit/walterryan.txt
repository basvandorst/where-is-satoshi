Moores law doesn't account for bandwidth or network capacity, which will be a big issue for many people. Besides that did you calculate how big blocks have to be to contain every coffee payment for millions of people? Bitcoin cash is centralized and it won't get any better. With lightning (which you obviously have not much clou about) you still have the option to use the decentralised 1st layer if you are not happy with it. Bcashs blockchain is doomed and you can't go back to anything else if you screw up the fundamental layer.

I think it's more about his permanent hypocrisy. I don't give a shit about mistakes like the middle finger he showedor even that racial slur thing, that can happen in the heat of a moment. But the fact that he actually gets mad when people call bitcoin cash "bcash" while he and bcash supporters keep calling bitcoin bitcoin core, segwitcoin or cripplecoin is just ridiculous. His company even called bcash "bitcoin" while calling bitcoin "bitcoin legacy" or "bitcion segwit". Either stop crying about namecalling and just shut the fuck up or stop it yourself.

In that case bitcoin itself also is not truly p2p, because you still rely on nodes to propagate your transaction. So it doesn't make a difference anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:28:15
Please stop talking if you have no clue. You obviously don't even know that transaction fees are calculated in satoshi per byte, so the dollar price is completely irrelevant. 
as you can see here you need 5 satoshi per byte for a normal transaction to be in the **next** block, thats about 0,1$.

You can transact with anyone as long as there is a route to them. If you are connected to me and I am connected to amazon for example, you can pay amazon through my channel and you can pay anyone amazon has a channel with and so on. 
So I think you will just need very few channels (maybe even just 1) to be able to pay any store accepting bitcoin via lightning.

fees are very low now. You actually overpaid a bit. Yesterday I sent 2 transactions with 5 and 6 sat/byte and both got confirmed in the next block. 
According to here  fees are still that low, so 5 sat are still very likely to be included in the next block.

From what I've heard theres one dev who "locked" funds on the mainnet accidentially, but they are not lost. They don't have the tools to recover his funds yet, but they know how to get it back and are working on it. So as you said, no funds have been lost so far, which doesn't mean it won't happen. Lightning on the mainnet is very small, as it grows bigger the probability of that happening is getting higher.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:00:58
I doubt that's correct. That would mean if your channel is used as a hop by anyone (A-&gt; B (you) -&gt; C) you don't have access to your funds anymore, that's definately not how lightning works.. 
I don't know the exact technical details, but in this example you (B, assuming you have 0,1 BTC in your channel to C) send 0,1 BTC to C just if you can be sure that you will receive 0,1 BTC from A. In the end you have the same amount as before obviously, A has -0,1 BTC and C has +0,1 BTC. After that transaction is done participant A can repeat it until he runs out of funds or until you (B) spend your 0,1 BTC otherwise, then A would have to find another route which does not include you anymore.
If you think I'm wrong feel free to correct me, I'd also be interested in a more technical source of your claims if you read it somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:30:16
Anyone can participate, even banks. That doesn't mean they can control anything though. Unlike bitcoin cash where just corporations or banks will be able to run full nodes when there are &gt;1GB blocks. Who knows if they see your transaction as valid if they don't like you.

It matches all the time if you want to. Stop posting this useless picture over and over again.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:25:36
Can you link to the website? I can't find it.
I still think you are not correct. It doesn't matter if you have 0,1 btc in a channel with person A. Person A holds 1 btc in a channel with you, while you own 0 bitcoin in this channel. He still can send the transaction through you to person B, which you have a channel with and it's funded with at least 0,1 btc. Person A sends 0,1 to you, you send 0,1 to person B. After that transaction you still have 0,1 btc in your channel with person B who now also has 0,1 bitcoin in that channel and you still own 0 bitcoin in your channel with person A, just like before. Person A has 0,9 bitcoin left. Since you still own your 0,1 bitcoin in your channel with person B, person A can send the same transaction again.
I think it's easy to visualize it like this. Person A just shifts 0,1 bitcion to Person B, everything inbetween stays the same, it's just that the 0,1 bitcoin gets handed forward to the next hop. Only the sender and receiver expierence a change in funds.

Well it is, but it's possibly quite difficult for non experts. Besides that if you fuck it up you might lock your coins for too long or even forever. So it's not recommended obviously
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:54:10
Double spending is something entirely different and not what I'm talking about. Double spending usually refers to spending the SAME bitcoin 2 times at the same time where 1 recipient loses that bitcoin because the other transactions gets confirmed first.
From what I understand lightning works like this: 3 persons A - B - C (with - being channels). When A wants to pay C through B, B pays C first and then A pays B when B proofs to A that he paid C. Everything is secured with smart contracts, so nobody can cheat anyone. The outcome is that A has less money and C has more money. The channel between B and C is unaffected and therefore:


that's exactly what I'm saying and I think thats accurate. You are limited, but just by the amount you have in your own channel with B, but not limited by what B has in its channel with C in terms of multiple transactions, but each transaction obviously can't be bigger than what B has in his channel with C.
 This video explains it quite well.

I think it's actually a problem with anything, but those low volume shitcoins are completely worthless. You are right that you can't sell large amounts of bitcoin very fast without affecting the price, but the same goes for someone who has huge shares of companies. If Jeff Bezos would start selling his amazon shares the price would plummet very hard aswell.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:43:43
I'm no expert either and your question is quite interesting. Since you don't have a direct channel to amazon your channel would not be affected. I guess amazon would have to close the channel which your route used as the last hop. Alternatively I'm pretty sure amazon could send those funds via lightning to another channel of theirs (amazon to amazon) and close that one without affecting open channels with customers or other hubs. 
Edit: and in a perfect world they wouldn't have to close that channel anyway because they would use lightning to pay their own bills and employees :-)
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:05:27

Currently fees are at about ~10sat/byte, so please stop trolling, besides that there are further optimizations on their way like schnorr, mast and further segwit adoption. I'm fine to pay 25cents or a few $ if I make a big payment directly on the blockchain. 


Yes, for **mainstream adoption**.
Almost nobody is strictly against a blocksize increase **if needed**. Making the network more efficient instead of wasteful is a desirable thing. If fees were currently a big issue people and exchanges wouldn't wait so long to adopt segwit which gives you a decent fee reduction instantly and more so if more people use it.
Stop blindly following r/btc and start using your own brain, if you are capable of that.

Whoever denies that climate change is happening is a complete moron. The question is how big is the impact of CO2, which can be argued to be irrelevant. You might want to peek into the joe rogan podcasts with Randall carlson
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:52:00
I don't think that's accurate. 
My understanding is that the amount you can send someone is basically limited to the channel with the least amount in it on the route. If you send something over 10 hops, 0,1 bitcoin for example, 0,1 bitcoin get forwarded separately for each channel to the next depending on some conditions until it reaches the target.
That said, I don't think anything prohibits someone sending 10x the same transaction to send someone 1 whole bitcoin, besides a higher fee which should be negligible.
Obviously a lightning wallet would find a route which makes your transaction possible, but I don't think you can send 1 bitcoin through channels with only 0,1 bitcoin funding.
I also believe a lightning transaction is currently limited to 20 hops.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:58:37


Can you give me some examples of those cryptos which don't have a company behind it or have another single point of failure? Besides that, what can those cryptos do better than bitcoin with upcoming upgrades like lightning, Rootstock, schnorr, mast, confidential transactions etc.?
Besides that you could also look up the history of other protokolls like TCP/IP or UDP which were developed 30-40 years ago and are still around. People are building layers on those protokolls exactly like bitcoin and its community will.
Some people might be seriously optimistic or too optimisic, but you seem to little educated and unnecessarily pessimistic.

That comparision is kinda stupid. Satoshi never mined in private or generated coins to enrich himself. Everbody was free to mine from the day he released the client. Should he have waited to mine until he could find thousands of people to start mining with him? Besides that he has more like 5-6% (which is going to go down with time) of the current supply and the ripple corp has way over **50%** of the total supply.
So how is that even comparable?

I don't see fees not going lower than what currently offers. There is basically no barrier to run a node for anyone on this world. It will  be a very competitive network with some people offering liquidity for free, because there are always people doing that. I don't think there will be an incentive to commercially run a lightning node routing normal transactions purely for profit. Maybe there is a market for unusual high ln transactions, but we will see about that. Either you are a merchant who accepts lightning and automatically provides liquiditiy to the network or you do it to help the network. In either case I expect fees to be converge at a very low point, way lower than lnbig fees today.

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:17:20
There are a few logical flaws. First I would not assume it happens before june 2020 and even if it does, your calculations work for a few months at most. So it's already just "half" as bad as you describe it. If the current growth of chinas energy production goes on as in between 2004 and 2010 ( couldn't find better numbers quickly) then in 2020 they are going to produce ~40.000 TWh, with your calculations AFTER the halving bitcoin would account for 0,7% of chinas energy production. It might be a lot, but in the end it's just insignificant. 
You also don't account for possible miner shortage, I'm by no means an expert, but since there will be another halving waiting for 2024 and it doesn't seem like to be easy to produce effective asics I doubt that suddenly everyone is going to invest like crazy or will be able to able to meet the possible demand for miners. 
So even if you numbers add up and if you don't make the most conservative estimations I don't see it as a problem at all. Besides that I'm pretty sure there could be tons of economical and technical reasons why your calculations aren't close to be realistic, but I'm neither an expert in mining, bitcoin or anything else that would matter to have an indepth discussion about that topic, but I would urge you to show your numbers some real experts and ask them if they see a problem (obviously almost no one in the bitcoin industry does)

How is lightning "barely" less centralized when anyone can run a node himself if he wants. Even if there would be nodes who wouldn't want to make any money and block your transaction, your payment would find another route. You are not dependend on anyone if you don't want to and you still don't have to ask permission to send someone money. Furthermore there is no lightning company who can freeze your account or steal your funds.

If you are refering to the myth it would remove signature data from tranactions, I think that has been debunked several times already.

As far as I know intermediaries don't know where the transaction started or where it will end. They don't know if you (or anyone sending through you) will pay the person connected to coinbase/putin or a person who is connected to that person, so they don't even know if it's really your transaction or who you want to pay. It could be a person you have a channel with or if you are connected to for example amazon it could be any other customer from amazon going through you and then through coinbase/putin. So I don't think there is much information to share.

What's your plan? Since bitcoin is an open source protocoll it's open to anyone, even to banks, governments or other institutions. It's legitimate to talk about the fact that they might enter the market. You are free to not use services like this and use bitcoin in a truly independend way, but you also have to accept that some people might trade security or independence for convenience (e.g. not having to worry about storing your bitcoin, which is quite a big deal for less technical people). Big players still can't change bitcoin on their own, so as long as I am able to use bitcoin the way I want I'm fine with anyone participating and I don't want to exclude anyone.

It will likely be enough for you have 1 channel to a big vendor. If you are connected to Steam for example you can route your transaction through every channel steam is connected to (which has sufficient funds in it) and whatever channels those people have to other vendors etc. It's will hopefully be a huge network where everyone is somehow connected to each other so you definately don't need a separate channel for each store you want to buy something from.

You can use your channel with steam to pay amazon or your bar aswell. So you can put e.g. $1000 on your lightning wallet for your everyday payments and use it for many different kinds of stores. At least that's the plan, it certainly will take some time for the network to evolve.

You don't need a channel to anyone you want to transact with and you also can add funds to a lightning channel via a normal bitcoin transaction or even another channel of yours if I'm not mistaken.
If you have a channel to steam for example you can transact through any other channel steam is connected to if it has enough funds, which could be millions some day. I don't think it's unlikely that you just need 1 channel to be able to transact with 95% of the vendors using lightning.

Suddenly you are talking about payrolls and m0 which have absolutely nothing to with what OP was posting. It was just the current state of bitcoins value, no more no less. No prediction of the future, no discussion about bitcoin as a way to pay employees or anything. Now please shut the hell up, it hurts my brain.

Bitcoin went from 1200$ to about 800$, but bitcoin didn't stay low very long. A major bullrun started shortly after, you can look it up on the charts. Rejection date was on March 10th 2017.

People buy (and create) altcoins because they want to get rich and make mad %, not because they want to use it. There might be room for some different kind of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it is not sensible to have multiple decentralized tokens used as currency or some other form of financial instrument. Besides that there aren't any other decentralized blockchains as far as I know, so the world will have to decide if they prefer a centralized database driven cryptocurrency which can be seized, manipulated and censored or if it's better to have something like bitcoin.
We will see.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:42:35
It was the same with the winklevoss etf last year. The decision was delayed until the last moment and then it was rejected. Not saying this ETF can't be approved, but it's not a positive sign for the etf. It was expected to happen that way.

I actually think this can be a big deal. Bitcoin is about giving people the choice of freedom, but not everybody wants to be 100% independent and responsible for the security of their own money, especially if it's a lot. I think if there's a reputable entity offering services like that many people who previously were too afraid of losing their coins would now be more confident and willing to enter the market.

@_date: 2018-08-20 12:08:48
I disagree. People hoard it now because the current potential upside is huge due to its little adoption. Do you have an estimate on how much the price would rise yearly after Bitcoin reached mass adoption or how many coins will be lost? I assume the vast majority of all lost coins were lost in the very early days, because Bitcoin had no value and it wasn't worth backing your wallet up, so I don't believe the overall supply will go down dramatically anymore.
I don't think people will stop buying stuff for the same reason you don't buy a new smartphone, tv or computer, because you are worried about the 2% inflation. You buy it because you want or need to have new stuff.

If bitcoin works people will use it to buy stuff, they even do it now. I think you are overestimating how much bitcoin would rise in price after it reaches mass adoption. There is lots of stuff people can invest in which provides more returns than bitcoins monetary deflation in the future.

We (or at least I) don't talk about Bitcoin now, but in the future. Now the potential upside is huge, so spending bitcoin without earning them doesn't make sense if you believe in its success. Once Bitcoin reaches a certain price there won't be much room to grow unlike now.


Well that's the plan and will happen if Bitcoin manages to get real global mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:25:10
To be able to transfer bitcoin instantly and almost for free without risking the main fundamentals of the base layer.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:26:52
No, there is not a single coin that can accomplish the same level of security, immutability, censorshipresistance and decentralization. That actually are the main properties of a cryptocurrency, otherwise you have a centralized payment system like paypal, which I'm personally not really interested in.
Your example ethereum shows that you don't invested much time into that topic. Because of it's turing complete programming language ethereum is way more insecure and error\-prone than bitcoin. It's not really a good idea to have a turing complete language if you want to be a global store of value and payment system. Besides that Bitcoin will be able to do exactly the same things as ethereum, just on a sidechain called rootstock which does not effect the base layer of bitcoin, whereas ethereum is fundamentally more insecure on the main blockchain.

Great store mate!  Unfortunately I checked reddit an hour too late, because I just bought a steam game from an other key store, but I definitely will buy something from your store when I'm finished with my current game!
Edit: Well I couldn't wait and wanted to buy something, but it seems like the node you have a sufficient channel with is not reachable at the moment. Hopefully that's just an issue at the beginning until a few customers have a channel open with you. I don't have enough funds on my lightning node for a new channel, otherwise I would open a channel to you.
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:23:23
Your wallet does this automatically. As soon as someone sends bitcoin to your address you get a new "receive" address. Your wallet manages everything for you, you just see 1 number which combines all bitcoin on your different addresses.

He said bitcoin is the only application which makes sense on a public blockchain that he has seen so far. He didn't mention any specific project or blockchain, but I would not be surprised if he didn't like ethereum. He also wrote an interesting article 
I pretty much agree with him. The word blockchain is just trending now, so everybody wants to make money with it, which is no surprise, but it does not offer any benefit to humanity, just because there's a (mostly centralized) blockchain involved.
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:20:21
When coinbase started using segwit the usage increased from 15&amp; to over 30&amp; and they weren't batching before and many exchange still don't. So I'm quite interested in how it hit a peak in 2014. Might also be interesting if you could compare the numbers of exchanges and companies using batching in 2014 compared to the overall tx volume vs. todays. I'm sure you have the numbers at hand.

No he is not right. You don't need exchanges at all. Miners don't have control over the network, even with 51% hashrate their power is very limited. Large bitcoin holders also don't have control over your funds or the bitcoin network, only thing they could do is temporarily crash the price and lose a lot of money themselves if they flood the market.

Who else could or would mine? The client was publicly released on January 9th 2009, so every person on the world could have downloaded it on that day and started mining. According to wikipedia Hal Finney downloaded the client on the first day and maybe others did as well.
My point is that I don't think anyone knows who did or did not mine in the early days. It's very often stated as a fact that satoshi owns 1 million bitcoin. It is not a fact but more a (according to I think, correct me if I'm wrong) badly done estimate.

No, it makes no sense to compare Bitcoin to coins with 100$ volume in 24 hours. Those can still have millions in market cap, making Bitcoins dominance smaller than it actually is. Marketcap is just a very bad metric for that.

Your argument is flawed. Bitcoin is a protocoll which is the first and still by far the best in what it wants to be. It's not a company or a software you can just swap out. Same es TCP or UDP which are like 40 years old. Blockchain itself is not a technologie that's important or groundbreaking.

What do you think would happen if you distribute all 21 million bitcoin equally to every human on earth? I think within a short amount of time there would be people with way more than others again. Also, I don' think it matters a lot if there are some early adopters with lots of bitcoin. If you are lazy and doing nothing productive you will eventually spend all your bitcoin, or pass them on your children who then will spend all of it, unless they are productive and earn more. That's true for every form of wealth I think. What's important about bitcoin is that there is no institution anymore who can print their own wealth. The difference between rich and poor will always be there, no matter what.

The payment you do on chain which has to be sent to a node you probably don't control which then propagates the transaction to other nodes you don't control until a miner puts it into a block. You think lightning has more "something in middle" than on chain?

Many words, no substance. Few monthsm ago an Austrian politician said that he thinks blockchain is interesting but he doesn't like Bitcoin. I couldn't care less what people who have no clue about the technology think. A blockchain which is not decentralized or controlled by a single entity makes absolutely no sense. It's an inefficient database. 
And just for the record. I started as a multicoiner and bought all kinds of cryptos which I still hold, but as time went on and I invested years in research and gathering more information I more and more came to the conclusion that there is nothing out there which can compete with Bitcoin as a form of uncontrollable and decentralized money.

No, you obviously don't understand. 


What is "every problem" and who said Bitcoin solves every problem and more importantly who does solve every problem? Nobody does, they just shift security and immutability for speed and lower fees, besides the fact that most coins are cheap because nobody uses them. Either that or they are heavily centralized like ripple.
I think you are short sighted and obviously don't understand what an open source protocoll is. If there is any breakthrough that would change the game bitcoin would very likely adopt it, but so far there is no coin that is close to be superior. If you think otherwise maybe you could name a few of those coins with

in about 9 hours the difficulty on bitcoin cash will rise by 300% or more which makes bitcoin more profitable to mine again. So there is absolutely no reason to mine bcash unless you are willing to take a loss to help that altcoin grow.

One hardware wallet should be sufficient. You can use password protected wallet where your password works like a 25th word in your seed. If you just store your 24 word seed and remembering your password (or telling relatives) someone will have a hard time getting your coins even if they manage to steal your seed. So more than 1 seed doesn't really make sense and isn't safer, but you will then have to safely store more seeds without someone having access to.
That said with your trezor you could just make more seeds if you wish to. Just be aware that you can just have one seed on your trezor at a time, if you want to access your coins from another seed you have to reset your trezor and enter your 24 words from whatever seed you wish to use.
You only need 2 hardwarewallets if you want to have access to more than one seed at the same time, otherwise you can use one trezor to generate different seeds.

I directly replied to your comment why it can be considered scam, but you choose to ignore it and go on with your agenda. If the IOTA Foundation advertises its coin as permissionless while at the same time taking funds from addresses they don't own that's actually massively misleading. I consider it scam, even if they give back those funds (which didn't happen with my funds yet). Nothing to do with destroying confidence, but just about showing people how centralized it is and why it's not even close to be a contester to bitcoin which many iota fanboys claim.
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:06:06
There are some wallets compatible with each others, but mostly they arent as far as I know. However, most wallets don't use own servers or anything so even if they stop developing it you can download an old version of it and recover your wallet, because you don't rely on their server to be running. Then you can send them to a newer or different wallet if you like.

Why are you sure? Who runs around with a fortune in bitcoin on their smartphones or who takes their hardwarewallet with them all the time?
I assume that todays bitcoin millionaires know how to securely store their coins and that means they probably don't run around with them on the streets. It's theoretically even possible to timelock your bitcoin or use a multisig address, so even if they physically assault you at home they couldn't make you send it to them.

You didn't make a case for that at all, just blubbering about store of value and recessions in the past which can't be compared at all to today, because society and consumerism changed massively.
Can you share your source of those numbers? Even if your 25&amp; are accurate (which I highly doubt), how many of those \~4 million bitcoin were lost between 2009 and 2011 compared to 2012 to 2018? I think it's safe to assume that the vast majority of lost bitcoins happened very early and nowadays a lot less bitcoin get lost because people are way more careful.

It is possible to attach some bitcoin to a timeframe, for example the mining rewards from 2009  including satoshis coins (which we actually don't know if they are really his, but they weren't moved yet) which are more than 1 million alone. So about 33&amp; of all lost coins are from the first year alone, but what about 2010, 2011 when Bitcoin had too little value for people to hassle about saving them?
You also are not arguing why Bitcoin can't be a currency. I already told you that its deflationary nature is not a reason in my opinion. Bitcoin can be both and even if it will be used as a reserve currency for a new form of fiat money it doesn't make much of a difference. You will always be able to use bitcoin to buy stuff once it's accepted from the mainstream.

People don't have to understand exactly about how bitcoin works, the same as people don't understand how emails or the internet work or computers work, or cars or basically anything remotely technical. It has to be easy to use. It might be too complex for SOME people now, but so was almost any new technology.
Another question I have for you. You are wasting almost every day on r/bitcoin concerntrolling. What exactly is your agenda? We both know you are dishonest in what you write and how you mean it. I'm not here every day, but when I am I see some concerntrolling or straightup lies from you all the time. I don't visit r/btc to tell them how shitty and useless bcash is, I also don't visit r/football every day and tell them football sucks and it should be called handegg instead.

Forking the blockchain to a previous block would defeat the purpose of bitcoin. What about thousands of legit transactions which would get reversed and possibly millions of lightning transactions and channels which would get resetted? I think it's more likely that Bitcoin will become quantum resistant before it's possible for quantum computers to affect bitcoin. Besides that as far as I know quantum computers only can compromise addresses which were used before, so if you put all your bitcoin to a new and unused address (which should be the case for 99&amp; of all holders) then nothing can happen to your bitcoin.

In your example Bitcoin goes up in value 50%, from 2 to 3 sheeps, but what makes you think Bitcoin will go up in value so much? Currently Bitcoin is very small so its room to grow is huge, but once it reaches mass adoption I doubt it will go up drastically. I don't have numbers, but it's reasonable to assume that the majority of all lost Bitcoin until now were lost in the very early days. Security and awareness is on a different level nowadays and will be even more important in the future with higher value. I doubt that you will stop buying stuff you want or need now for the same reason as you don't buy a new smartphone, TV or whatever, because you are worried about inflation.
Besides that we have a completely different consumer behaviour today than we had 100 years ago. What did people buy 100 years ago and what do we buy today? We throw money down the drain every day, we have new technology every day and amazon who delivers it within 2 days.

But what if you think about it like this, if you have those perfect 10 minute blocks all the time and you are constantly sending transactions starting from now until 10 blocks in the future wouldn't be the average confirmation time be 5 minutes?

Is is complex, but the average user doesn't have to understand it. People today don't understand how smartphones or how their computer or the internet works, it just has to be user friendly enough.

Usually an invoice expires after a set time (default 3600 seconds = 1 hour on my lnd node). I also don't think there is any problem reusing an invoice besides you probably unintentionally sending someone the same payment twice.

No they were not. I found my addresses in their list of addresses they stole with the correct amount on them.

Yes, that's how it should work. It will also be possible to refund existing channels without the need to close them and open a new one.

As far as I know about 10&amp; of the total money supply is actual cash and 90&amp; is checkbook money. That seems to be a major concern about fiat in general and not exclusive to tether or their bank.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, not an expert at all.

I'm wondering how that revelation fits into the narrative of r/btc about Blockstream. They could have stayed quiet about that and attack BCH with only a part of their hashpower easily. It's also apparent that they have lots of skin in the game and incentive to help keeping Bitcoin valuable.
It almost looks like they don't give a shit about BCH.

I sent payments to 5 different stores without being directly connected, I have to be superlucky then.

Just because some people don't know what they are doing doesn't mean it's not working.

That will happen, but with sidechains and 2nd/3rd layer technology. There is absolutely no need for several separate tradable tokens if a single one can do the job best, being hard money.

Bitcoin would only be dead if there would have been a block size increase orchestrated by a few companies and rich people. There was no consensus so nothing happens. Bitcoin got way stronger getting rid of that drama and seeing that bcash and alts are slowly going down the toilet and many big exchanges still not using batching and segwit shows us that fees and throughput has no priority to the market. It's about security and immutability which no other coin actually had, especially not bcash.

They don't have ip addresses or bitcoin addresses and don't even know who sent the payment and who receives it. Routing nodes only know the node before and after them, but they can't tell if the hop before is the origin or just another hop in a bigger route and they also don't know if the node they are forwarding it to is the receiver or just another part of the route. Besides that as far as I know it's possible to have private channels which don't get broadcastet at all so nobody except the sender and payee knows it exists.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:13:22
IOTA is fundamentally better? The IOTA Foundation stole my IOTA. Now I had to make a weird reclaiming process many weeks ago and I don't even know when and if I get them back.

Should be possible with lightning loop soon.
 
We call off-chain to on-chain swaps, a **Loop Out**. The service can be used in various situations:
* Acquiring inbound channel liquidity from arbitrary nodes on the Lightning network
* Depositing funds to a Bitcoin on-chain address without closing active channels
* Paying to on-chain fallback addresses in the case of insufficient route liquidity
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:03:44
Starting a comment with "lol" and then proceeding with proof that you don't know what you are talking about. The IOTA Foundation took custody of my tokens. How about you educate yourself about the reclaiming process? They took my IOTA from my Adresses (which have all 0 balance now) to hold it themselves without my consent. I consider that stealing. Now I had to proof with this weird reclaim tool that I had access to those addresses they took it from. I did that about 1 month ago and I still have not received my tokens back. Now, why did they even have to do this? Because the whole network is insecure and apparently pre alpha, otherwise they wouldn't have to steal from me so nobody else can do it before them.
The problem you are talking about is also ridiculous, but something else entirely. Since you obviously don't understand what I am talking about I don't want to waste my time reading your whole post, because I assume there's not much knowledge behind it.










Oh yeah, some people need to identify themselves to get their stolen coins back. Such decentralization, wow.

I did an "experiment" a few months ago to check what the average "next-block-confirmation time is. I picked random dates and times and checked how long it took until the next block was found from that time. Sample size was about 30.
Initially I thought it had to be 5 minutes, because if you randomly pick a time between blocks (which average 10 minutes) you should have to be getting consistent numbers between 1 and 10 minutes averaging 5.
Turns out the average confirmation time for the next block was pretty much 10 minutes (a tad less I believe). Just thinking about it wasn't enough to be logical to me, but I never took the time educating myself about the maths behind it. I hope I will find some enlightenment in your link tomorrow, since that 20 minute number is hopefully related.
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:44:01
What happens if a node on the route goes down before being able to propagate the preimage back to the sender after the receiving node confirmed the payment? Will the sending node wrongfully see it as failed payment although it happened?

That's not how it works. You have a certain probability of finding a block depending on your hashrate, it's completely independent from other miners.
You have x difficulty and y hashrate and you find z blocks in average. If x and y is the same for bitcoin and bitcoin cash z is also the same.
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:42:18
I'm aware of that. That's also why the average time in my case was 9 minutes 5x minutes. Maybe I will do that experiment again tomorrow and also add the time to the previous block instead of the next one. I assume the result will be my initial 9:5x minute number x 2

I'm wondering if you talked about some questions you want to ask before or if you just realized before that asking Pieter Wuille about drama regarding certain altcoins, block sizes and other political stuff makes no sense. I get the impression that he doesn't give a shit about any of that and just wants to write the best code he can and make Bitcoin the best it can be. Just as he somewhat dodged the cypherpunk question. I really admire his work ethic.
Also loved that indian dude at the end. Seems like he is really living his dream.

I don't know what you expect from Bitcoin, but the big money is not to be made with bitcoin in 15 or 20 years from now when it's grown and reached real mass adoption. It certainly will be better than inflationary money, but I doubt holding bitcoin will make you rich. People are and will always be greedy and they still will invest their bitcoin in stuff which potentially brings more returns.
Do you have numbers of the annual rate of newly lost bitcoin or some estimates? I also assume that number will go down with time with better wallets and other security measures and maybe professional custody etc.
@_date: 2018-06-03 20:25:58
Bitcoin doesn't force you to be responsible for all your wealth, it offers you a choice. I'm fairly certain there will be bitcoin banks which offer professional and insured custody \(There actually was a big announcement a few weeks ago\). You are dependend on them if you do that, but the main reason bitcoin exists is completely unaffected by that. Regarding bad actors I don't think it's much different from other currencies or economies. If you send a bank transaction you usually can't get your money back at all, that's a misconception of how our current system works. Those nigerian princes and email scammers make a lot of money from old and unaware people. At least in central europe you can get scammed no matter if you are using cryptos or not. Besides that I agree that there are lots of bad actors in the crypto space and I also don't oppose certain regulations and adaption of laws to make it work better for everyone.
About your reasoning of being here I totally respect that, although I don't always have the impression you play devil's advocate, but rather just hate on bitcoin or twist stuff to make it sound worse than it actually is.
@_date: 2019-10-14 17:05:55
Correct. That's why I said "if he tried to cheat". If your counterparty is honest nothing will happen. It's also worth mentioning that this only can affect you if you got paid (or routed a payment) through this channel. If you are exclusively spending nothing can happen, because your balance would be higher with any older state.

I don't think you can steal the pin only from software side, at least if the pin is  sufficiently secure.

@_date: 2018-06-08 16:53:19
It's weird thinking about it. I'm pretty sure having a block every 10 minutes instead of a 10 minute average it would make a difference, because if there were no blocks later than 10 minutes after the previous one there could not be a confirmation time higher than 10 minutes, but confirmation can be faster (1 to 9 minutes), so in that case the average confirmation time has to be lower than 10 minutes, I still think in that case it's 5 minutes. On the other hand having an average of 10 minutes for each block does lead to 10 minute confirmations, I just tested it by randomly choosing 20 dates from today and calculating when it would have been confirmed. What's weird about it is that in both cases the average blocktime would be 10 minutes, the first time because there would be a block every 10 minutes, not sooner nor later, in the real world it's average about 10 minutes because of how bitcoin works.
I know about the monte hall paradox, I don't know details, but I remember that the explanation actually made sense to me. Probability stuff is indeed very interesting, for example it is very unlikely to have 15 times red in roulette, 16 times is even more unlikely, but the 16th game itself still has the same almost 50:50 probability. Fascinating and confusing at the same time.
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:50:09
Yeah I saw that, but it still doesn't work. I get the "unkown next peer" error. I had the same problem with blockstream, I assume it could be a lnd and c\-lightning problem \(I use lnd\). I do have 3\-4 channel with sufficient funds to other bigger nodes, so I think there should be at least 1 possible route. I also opened a channel to your lnd node which is still pending, is it possible to somehow get invoices which go to your lnd node?

I don't see a reason why not. You just need to be sufficiently connected with 24/7 uptime.
That said, there is not too much to earn since payments will route around you if your fees are too high and with default fees you get 1 sat per transaction. It's a way to pay for your own transaction fees though, even if it's just a few sats here and there.

Not necessary if you don't expect to be paid frequently and LN certainly isn't dead until every user has a 24/7 online node. I used LN a lot so far, with my own node and with android apps, because I use it to buy stuff not to get paid.

I doubt you node would be overwhelmed. A lightning transactions does not need a lot of processing power for the receiver, I'm sure an average node can handle 100 transactions within few seconds without any problem. I don't know if you can create an invoice which can be used multiple times, but generally I don't think there's any technical limitation for that. It makes more sense though (if you are a merchant accepting lightning) to have 1 invoice for every customer automatically generated when they purchase stuff, otherwise you don't know which customer paid their invoice and who didn't.

You shouldn't treat the lightning network like a starbucks app. The lightning network is not meant to pay one single service then let it go. One channel can be used for months or years to pay merchants all over the world. Besides that there is something called autopilot which will handle everything for you. Every lightning wallet also has a normal bitcoin wallet integrated, the autopilot will open and close channels automatically without you having to worry about that.
You also can receive bitcoin via lightning which you can use to pay others again. No need to open small channels all the time.Also you usually don't have to wait 1-2 hours. Depending on the fee you have to wait \~10 minutes for 1 confirmation  and usually after 2 or 3 confirmations the channel is open and ready to use.

@_date: 2019-10-14 14:08:16
No, you don't. If you have a channel open there are 2 options to close it.
Cooperatively or uncooperatively (force close). Uncooperative closing of a channel happens if one of the two parties is offline and the other one wants to close it. To prevent the online party to publish an old state in which he has more sats than he actually has there is a set timeframe before the channe actually gets closed during which you have to be online once to automatically prevent that. If your counterpart tried to cheat he will get punished by losing all of his funds to you.
So you have to be online once in a while, depending on the channel properties (can be hours, days or weeks for example). I'm not sure what the default value will be for electrum. If you have an unstable connection you should be fine unless you are offline for a long period. You probably won't be very useful as a routing node, but you don't have to be to participate in lightning.

No. You can open and close multiple channels with a single on chain transaction. Also it won't be a problem for the same reason as opening a bank account is inconvenient (way more so than opening a lightning channel) and a lenghty process, but you don't do that very often, do you?

You didn't argue anything, you just stated random anti lightning propaganda as fact.


Bullshit, I'm using it for more than a year now. Works fine for me. Also theres no argument here.


Again no argument, just a random shortsighted statement.  Lightning is trustless, even bigger hubs don't know the origin or destination of a transactions so they wouldn't even know what they are censoring and if a hub won't forward your transaction you are free to open as many channels with as many other nodes as you want. How can you be sure that the node your wallet uses (as bcasher you very likely don't run your own node) is relaying your transaction and not censoring you?
Besides that there are safety incentives to not keep large amounts of bitcoin on lightning for the same reason exchanges hold most coins in cold storage. I doubt there will be a few megahubs, but probably thousands or tens of thousands medium sized ones.


You seem to assume that every channel opening or closing needs its own onchain transaction. You also seem to assume that there won't be new tech implemented on the base layer to enhance efficiency and throughput.


Again no argument, just a weird generalized statement which also is not true. You don't have to pay anything or anyone. You don't need watchtowers if you are online for e.g. once a week depending on your channel properties or if you don't plan to receive money and just use lightning for spending. You probably won't need it at all, because the incentive to steal money isn't here, because you don't know if you are successful beforehand and if not you would lose all your founds. Also it's perfectly possible that your own watchtowers will be integrated in some device which is always online in the future, your router for example.
And you never "trust a thrid party with your funds", unless you choose to use a custodial wallet, which is true for any cryptocurrency, so that's just another lie.


No. I've took 5 minutes to read through your recent history and you are lying again. You spread bullshit on r/btc and you are clearly a bcasher and lately shilling nano, so you obviously don't intend to learn anything about lightning which doesn't fit in your world view.

While it's obviously not the main reason for many people to buy in, the technology is the main reason why Bitcoin was sustainable for the last 10 years and probably a lot more in the future which makes it a viable option for longterm storage of value which will attract all kinds of money for all kinds of reason in time.

There is just absolutely no need to replace it with something else besides people who bought the other coin wanting to get rich.

I assume. As you can see if someone generates a private key like that and uses it, it's pretty unsecure. Those can be found easily, not because bitcoin is unsecure, but rather because they are generated with low entropy. Properly generated private keys can not be found like that, or at least it's as unlikely as winning the lottery a few times in a row.
It's fun to look around some phrases. This one for example is actually just zero input:  [  Someone actually sent 50 bitcoin in 2015 to that address until someone sent them away after 11 minutes. You can see that nowadays every incoming bitcoin gets sent away within a few seconds, because bots are probably scanning those addresses 24/7.
edit: if you are interested to look around yourself, you can take those private keys and anter them here at "walletdetails" to get the public key which you can look up on any blockexplorer.  [

I'm opposed to a complex separate lightning logo. Lightning is Bitcoin and therefore we should use the Bitcoin logo with some simple form of information that it (wallet, merchant etc.)  supports lightning.

Years away for what? Ultimate mass adoption? Figure, everything in the space is years away, it's a process and there also is no, "now it's ready". It will become "more" ready over time. A better autopilot (current version already working fine though) and UI and AMP are certainly not years away, that will diminish your concern about channel management. The amount you need for certain nodes don't have anything to do with that. It's an arbitrary number any node can come up with if they like, just open your channel with someone else. It might be more complicated for now to get it right, but it IS working.
Segwit hasn't helped much? We have pretty much the same amount of transactions today as in december 2017, counting batched transaction from exchanges we certainly have more people receiving transactions than ever before. How about you take a look at fees today vs fees 2017 -&gt;  [
Thanks to segwit blocks seem to average now at about 1,3mb now, so it definitely helped. Even with "only" \~50% of transactions being sent from segwit addresses. Before even thinking about raising the blocksize further (segwit does that already) people, exchanges, wallets etc. should switch to segwit. It makes more sense to be more efficient first instead of going the easy way and letting people be inefficient instead at the cost of more centralization.
Efficiency first, then raising the blocksize if really necessary and possible in a safe way. Hardforks aren't easy, just look at what a mess Bcash and BSV is, because hardforks seemed so easy for them.

Either you deleted your comment or you were rightfully banned, anyway here is my answer before I block you.


I'm not using shitcoin very liberally, I'm using it when it fits, which is pretty much always. Interesting that you think you can deduce my knowledge from that.






IOTA is a prime example of a shitcoin. I bought some myself when it was first listed on bitfinex, because I was interested. After the network was seemingly so insecure that the IOTA Foundation had to sweep my coins from my wallet and made me do a reclaim process which took months, because devs said I should wait with the process until the network actually works, I don't consider them promising in any way. 
Also since IOTA was listed it lost \~50% of it's value, so when exactly did you buy? Your account is active for about 12 months, IOTA shilling started shortly after, so you are pretty new to that space.


Actually you are just full of shit. Every altcoin with a non-laughable volume is well down against bitcoin since that bear market started. You shouldn't make stuff up with your shady account.
Done talking to you, not wasting my time with trolls with throwaway accounts anymore.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:14:43
I don't agree raising the blocksize at this time is the right thing to do. I believe it's essential for a system like Bitcoin to be as secure and as efficient as possible. Why make blocks bigger instead of transactions smaller? We should do everything we can to make Bitcoin better and more secure without having to hardfork repeatetly which is just not a good idea. We have some things like Schnorr signatures and MAST which will improve throughput by making transactions more efficient. We still only have about 50% Segwit transactions, many exchanges still aren't batching. Those companies can improve throughput and enhance their customers experience, just by being more efficient. If it takes high fees and customers leaving for other exchanges who can do better, then that's how it is supposed to be.


That is sacrificing security though. As we could see 2017 there is absolutely no consensus about increasing the blocksize further (segwit already did that in a very conservative way). Users, exchanges, Miners etc. seemed to have agreed that Bitcoin is fine as it is and it's not worth the risk for now. That's why BCH has 5% hashpower, \~5% price and a ridiculously small amount of transactions. Trying to push another blocksize increase again would only result in another fork and more drama we don't need.
And as I said, with more segwit adoption, more batching and upcoming stuff throughput will get another nice bump without much big of a risk. Everyone can opt out of any softfork if it's not safe for any reason, a fucked up hardfork is way more dangerous.
Luke already argues that node count is dangerously low and he certainly has his reasons to believe that. Who would monitor the count and who would decide what's bad and what's acceptable? What would happen if node count goes down dramatically and who decides that? I don't think it's as trivial as you think.

As far as I know the publicly available balance doesn't show changes in terms of local/remote amount, just the overall balance from both nodes combined. So there is no way to know if a transaction actually happened, because channels won't even be updated when routing a transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:53:35
yes, but you won't lose your bitcoin. It takes a few days until you can spend them again.
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:14:01
No. That's not what it was about. The main point was that people can and will use Bitcoin however they like as long as it is possible within the rules of the protocol. There will be big custodians and many people will use them and some will prefer privacy, security and absolute trustlessness, like is.
My argument is that the average people don't want to learn about stuff in general. They want it to work, be convenient and easy and that's fine with me, because Bitcoin gives you the option to use it either way.
And please quote me where I said people should not be educated and stop twisting my words, that's pathetic.

" I’ve come to the realization that it is still years away". Arbitrary statement without any substance. Lightning is working today, but obviously can and will be tremendously improved in the future. Stuff like AMP is not years away.
" And nothing is being done about the fees in the short term." Segwit got implemented, exchanges started batching and using segwit, otherwise we would have the same fees as 2017 now. Besides that devs work on further optimizations which improves efficiency instead of a blunt blocksize increases which doesn't solve the scaling issue.

which is not a base for any discussion at all, not even simple.
Secondly you don't seem to understand Bitcoin at all. It is an open source protocoll which can be used by anyone for any reason at any time. Any use case that doesn't violate the ruleset of the bitcoin protocoll is a valid use case, besides unintentional bugs. That includes banks and financial institutions using Bitcoin and offering several services for it. It also includes terrorist or other illegal activities.
**Who are you to tell people what is ok and how to be** ***correctly*** **involved in Bitcoin?**
That said, if you open your eyes to the world a tiny bit you will come to realize that ***most*** people will prefer ease of use and convenience over security and privacy.

I've yet to see a really serious and technical discussion with competent people from both sides.

supply and demand
faith and believe in bitcoin, that's why people want it and that's why it has its value. And if you are asking why people have faith in bitcoin you should inform yourself about what bitcoin wants to achieve.

We shouldn't even thinking about raising the block size until we have close to 100% segwit adoption. Blocks can be a lot bigger than today. If people/exchanges/wallets are too stupid or lazy to implement segwit we have to live with paying higher fees. Eventually the market will speak and services who don't go for maximum efficiency will lose customers which will force them to get the work finally done or they will go out of business. There is a lot to improve and to gain efficiency without needing to hard fork, so why shouldn't we do that first? More segwit, batching, schnorr, mast and whatnot.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:19:18
When less people mine the difficulty goes down to keep the average of 1 block every 10 minutes, which means the new supply stays the same (about 1800 bitcoin per day until the next halving). Dropping difficulty also means that it's cheaper to mine which attracts new miners meaning difficulty will go up again. It's true that until the difficulty adjustment it's possible to have less or more blocks found, depending if hashrate goes up or down during that period, but that's only temporary.
That's actually the reason we have a slightly higher average than 10 minutes since the start of bitcoin, because the hashrate steadily went up the last 10 years with the difficulty always being one step late with its 2016 block period.

"simply" existing? Aka running for 10 years without a single major interruption, holding value in the billions without being hacked once. Also withstanding various different attacks from companies and rich people. Yes, it's sustainable in storing value. Price also doesn't actually matter. With more people realizing what properties Bitcoin has the value will go up automatically.
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:38:17
Both is relevant at this time in my opinion since most stuff you buy in bitcoin is specified in fiat currency. If the price in fiat goes up people need to spend less bitcoin to buy their stuff which helps with liquidity.

Not necessarily. Once it's **really** needed there might be actually consensus for it. Today there obviously is not, as you could see with the segwit2x debacle and the failed experiment called Bcash.
With lightning you should realize that the first beta is out for just one year. The most important part for newbies is a better UI and a better working autopilot. That's nothing that can't be solved within a shorter timeframe. Whatever happens behind the scene is not that relevant for those users. Stuff like AMP will make it overall way more reliable though.

As others have pointed out your port is probably closed. That said, depending on how it actually gets checked it might not be reliable.

Bitcoin is a decentralized open source protocoll. It does not have partnerships. People use it or they don't. Just because centralized coins which are controlled by a company who seeks partnerships doesn't mean bitcoin "can never dream of it" or is worse. 
Bitcoin is now as fast as it was years ago and with 2nd layer technology and sidechains it will be even faster and suitable for pretty much any usecase. As far as I know there is not a single coin out there which has proven it's "better" technology at scale even close to that of bitcoin, besides ethereum which had big problems with network congestion lately.

I have never thought about a 51% attack that much. People always just talk about double spending and that it's not a big deal, but if you have &gt;51% of the hashpower you can actually kick every other miner off the network with reorgs.

That's exactly why 99% of altcoins exist today. People hoping that their coin will also gain thousands of %. Most of them aren't interested in the technology or making the world a better place. That's not why Bitcoin exist. Being early in Bitcoin, risking your money in an unproven technology, but seeing the potential should earn you a bonus, what's wrong with that? If you buy Bitcoin to get more fiat you will have sold anyway on the way to mass adoption. People who hold long term because they believe in Bitcoin deserve their wealth. Besides that I don't see a better form of distribution than Bitcoin. Everyone was free to mine in the early days or buy when it was cheaper.
Having hundreds or  thousands of alts where a company or a private person/group decides how many tokens they issue, what the supply cap should be and how they distribute it while putting a big chunk into their own pocket to get rich quick is more convincing and a better distribution to you? People would use those new coins to take money from stupid people who don't know better and then dump it for Bitcoin, as they do today. What's the point of those coins if the only reason is to accumulate wealth by ripping of greedy and stupid people which they can then transfer to Bitcoin when they are done? They certainly wouldn't stop and start a new coin, rinse and repeat.
In general distribution to me is an absolutely non issue. Even if you would distribute all the wealth on earth equally to every person on earth, I'm sure within a decade or so it would pretty much look like today, except banks and goverments will hopefully have a harder time abusing their power and manipulating their currency. Some people like to save their money, some like to spend it all as soon as they get it, some are smarter and some are dumber. Wealth distribution will never be equal and Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies aren't here to change that. Doesn't mean it's fine to have companies like ripple who put 80% of the total supply in their own pocket, but the way Bitcoin does it is perfectly fine to me, no need to have altcoins trying to take away Bitcoins marketshare to move wealth from one group to another for absolutely no reason. Sorry, but that has to be the weakest pro altcoin argument I've ever heard.

Saifedean Ammous view makes more sense to me. If having thousands of daily used currencies were viable it would be trivial for anyone to inflate the the market with more and more shitcoins. There has to be a single currency which hold its value better than the rest, other properties are secondary and can be built on top of it. It's fair to assume that people will tend stick with this one instead of others. Whether it's Bitcoin or not, I think eventually people will  grow tired of investing in shitcoins hoping they will replace Bitcoin, not the other way round. There is just no need.
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:46:40
Doesn't make sense to me. There is just no room for many different cryptocurrencies. Today we have many fiat currencies because they are centralized and governments obviously want to control their own currency, not because it is efficient and makes sense. As you can see in the european union, it's actually way more convenient to have the Euro in many different countries, besides the single point of failure which can fuck everything up. Also, how would that many cryptocurrencies "earn" their value? In terms of decentralization, security, immutability, censorship resistance, having a definite supply cap etc. it's just not sensible to have more than one currency, if that currency does it well (Bitcoin). That's just inefficient and unnecessary. There might be some other niche cases for a few others like Ethereum, but still there is pretty much nothing Bitcoin couldn't adapt on different layers or sidechains if there is demand for it. 


Not really. Diversifying to reduce risk and volatility is pointless if you put everything in crypto. All cryptos usually move very similar with a few exceptions. Getting gold, real estate and other commodities does reduce risk.  This (non)advantage is certainly no reason or justification for hundreds or thousands of cryptocurrencies, centralized or decentralized. They are just a moneygrabtool for those who issue them and I doubt it would be different in the future.

If a guy who already was depressed loses a lot of money and then commits suicide, that's not a relevant story to bitcoin. Bitcoin might be relevant to him and his family, but it's not the other way round. This sub seems to agree. I don't understand why you are still arguing here. (besides trolling)

If it were arbitrary then Bitcoin wouldn't have survived 10 years. I don't understand your point. If someone forks he pushes himself onto another network. People would have to actively switch to that fork if they support it, if they don't like it or if they just  don't pay attention they stay at the original Bitcoin chain. If there is no good reason to support a different chain you stay where you are. The difficulty for other coins to become even remotely as secure and decentralized as Bitcoin makes Bitcoin harder money than them, if you fork and you are the only miner on your new chain it's neither secure nor decentralized and the supply cap doesn't mean anything anymore.
I also don't believe that you follow Bitcoin for 10 years if you think that just having less supply makes something harder money.

I doubt it was necessary. It wasn't necessary before and it apparently isn't necessary now after it ended. Besides that since november 2017 alone they got 63000$ in donations at current price. Both operators are very early adopters and very likely worth millions.

I'm pretty confident lightning won't work like that in general, maybe in the earliest days of adoption. It obviously won't be the case that every customer has to open a channel with every shop. As a user you open a couple of channels (works automatically with a thing called autopilot) for a few bucks and then you should be able to pay almost anyone on the network for an unspecified time, sending and receiving payments with your existing channels. It's like putting your money on your bankaccount to buy stuff. Vendors also don't pay your banking fees, do they? Likewise they won't pay your fees for opening channels, but that should not be something you do regularly.

If the world runs on Bitcoin, why should it go up more than the annual amount of lost Bitcoin? (besides normal fluctuation). We can debate about how many coins will be lost, but I doubt that it will be a lot.
Until then Bitcoin obviously has enormous room to grow, I'm not talking about a few % every year from today on, but in a distant future where Bitcoin has grown to fit the worlds economy. It's nothing that happens over night, it's more like a process which might take decades. 


Sorry, but do you actually think that a technology like Bitcoin will transform the world within 10 years? It's a miracle that something like Bitcoin got any value at all. The pace of its growth is just astounding to me. 10 years ago some dude released a piece of software, today it's the hardest money the world has ever seen and a selfsustaining decentralized monetary system used by millions of people and a viable alternative to their dying currencies for many people. 


Bitcoin is an open source protocoll which has been and will be improved as time goes on. The basics are set in stone since day one, but everything from efficiency to usability is not comparable to what satoshi initially released and the future Bitcoin will not be comparable to todays Bitcoin.


We don't know how the world looks like in 20 years, so it might be completely false to try to fit a potential future with Bitcoin into todays society and economy. Could be that there will be lots of changes and maybe the world will adapt and change with something like Bitcoin around. We will see.

Why do you assume people would stop buying stuff when their bitcoin raises lets say 2% a year in value? (assuming no room to growth in terms of economic marketshare) Did you buy your last TV, Smartphone or PC hardware because of the 2-3% inflation we currently have? No? Would you NOT buy a new TV because Bitcoin would gain value over time? It's the same as people still buy current technology for more money instead of better technology for less money in the future. People just want to have new stuff and it's not sensible to wait for all time, because technology gets cheaper (or bitcoin gets more valuable)
We have a vastly different buying consumption nowadays than in the last decades. People buy  stuff, because they want it. I'm fairly certain they will keep buying their yearly Iphone or a new gaming console with Bitcoin aswell.
Besides that I find it midly silly to expect an everlasting economic growth for all eternity, because that's supposed to be healthy. Do you think it's feasible long term to have a growing economy for all time?

That's just ignorant. You don't seem to understand what Bitcoin is actually about and how it works. Also, if another shitcoins team miraculously finds something revolutionary, which I very much doubt, Bitcoin can and will adopt it. You sound like Bitcoin doesn't change. It's code and it changes if necessary. 
Besides that the fee for a lightning transactions is from zero to 1 satoshi per hop. For a 5 hop transaction thats 0,01825 cent (or 0.0001825 $)
@_date: 2019-01-04 11:55:01


That's why I said "assuming no room to growth in terms of economic marketshare". We are talking about Bitcoin as a world currency, not in its current state which is very small.
What would make bitcoin go up in value once there is hardly room to grow? Lost and destroyed Bitcoin. I assume that in a world with Bitcoin as its main currency people will be way more careful with their coins than even today, besides the technical advances in terms of security and storage. So that assumption might not be completely arbirtary.


I don't think so.


Your argument is that people would stop buying and investing and just hoarding, because of Bitcoin going up in value. As you said yourself "of course not". People still would buy stuff they don't need and people would still invest their Bitcoin to gain more actual Bitcoin instead of "just" having 2% value gain per year.


You sound like it's an universal truth that Bitcoin can't function as a currency. I say it's possible and we should actually find out to be certain. Can't be wrong to try out an alternative to a monetary system which gets played and controlled and used to fuck their citizens over by a few people.

@_date: 2019-01-04 10:38:05
That's just painfully wrong. Having less supply is completely irrelevant and doesn't make anything new or better or even harder. Bitcoins hardness comes from the fact that nobody can change stuff like this in Bitcoin and not from the amount of available or mined supply. If you fork off like Bcash you are an irrelevant chain that loses all of Bitcoins security and economy behind it which makes Bitcoin hard money.

First of all nobody knows how many Bitcoin satoshi has. There are different estimates, but we certainly do not know.
That said if someone would sell 1 million bitcoin as a market order all at once the price would fall down to zero instantly until people would start panicbuying and the price rises again.
It's still not sensible to assume something like this would happen. The same could be said about anything which has a market to sell stuff. Whoever has a big amount of Bitcoin would lose a lot of money, they would rather sell slowly to affect the price as little as possible.

I don't know what this bot is talking about (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:52:19
I'm no expert, but I think that's very much possible. I will try that out on the testnet with my lnd node.
EDIT: Despite of the question if this makes sense or if it's _asinine_, I am able to run 2 nodes at the same time with the same wallet information. I do only have 1 outgoing ip address since they run on the same server, so I don't know what happens if there are 2 different servers with the same pubkey on the network. I assume you wouldn't be able to connect to the same peers, but channels shouldn't be affected (at the best of my very very limited knowledge).
It's fun to play around anyways for me as a layman, even if there very well might be better solutions to the being always online question.
So, while I can run 2 nodes with the same wallets at the same time, after playing around a bit they are completely out of sync, doesn't matter if you open channels, send lightning txs or on chain txs. If I would close all channels on one node the possibility is high to broadcast an old state which might cost you your whole balance as a punishment. So it's not a good thing to try now (unless you are on the testnet to play around). Maybe there can be a possibility of syncing both nodes with a service like said.

@_date: 2018-03-13 23:03:05
I think (almost) everybody agrees that the block size has to increase some day, people just disagree about the "when". I believe that increasing the blocksize would disincentivize pretty much anybody in the network to be as efficient as possible and to work on efficiency-raising proposals. I doubt coinbase and other big exchanges would have started batching or using segwit if we had bigger blocks. It also might stall stuff like schnorr or MAST which don't only make bitcoin more efficient and increase the overall capacity.
It makes more sense to me to make bitcoin as efficient as possible before increasing the blocksize, unless it's absolutely necessary.

My understand of the lightning network is very superficial, so tell me if I'm wrong. What I think your comment implies that it could actually be dangerous if you try using more nodes with the same wallet information at different times. If transactions won't get updated automatically via the network (which I don't know to what extend that happens), then closing a channel could lead to you getting penalized for broadcasting an old state of a channel if the node you are running at that time is not up to date.

Bitcoin Core 0.15 should improve it a lot, it's not just coinbase. Even trezor and all the android apps I used (breadwallet, jaxx, mycelium) have way way way too high fee estimations.
Besides that, Trezor even states: **If you set too low fee, it might get stuck forever.**

How  is that relevant to "there is no way to do this without a third party also having access to your money"?
Besides that you should educate yourself about channel factories or how it will be possible to refund existing channels. You can also open a channel with funds on the other side, so the receipient doesn't have to open a channel himself. Lots to learn.

/edit: I have to add the obligatory advice: **Don't invest more than you can afford to lose!**
Not trying to tell people what to do, but if someones tells you Bitcoin is *safe* to invest, no it is not, but it has tons of potential obviously.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:57:58
It's always better to have a small amount of bitcoin than none. However, you shouldn't expect massive returns for your 25$. It helps calculating it percentage wise, if bitcoin gets to 50.000$ (50,000 for americans ;-P) you get 1000% profit which would be 250$ in your case, it's very nice but not life changing. 
If you can afford it you could buy more little amounts over the next weeks, months or years while never having invested more than you are willing to lose!
good luck to us all!
/edit: and obviously: use a wallet where you control your private keys, don't have it lying around on an exchange like coinbase,kraken or something similar, even if it's a small amount. An android app would be a better alternative, like breadwallet or mycelium.

What are the most important properties of a cryptocurrency? To me it's immutability, immunity to censoring, trustlessness, decentralization, being open to anyone anytime. Fast and cheap (and anonymous) transactions are coming to bitcoin, but they don't have highest priority, because it's damn difficult to have those while maintining the above mentioned features. There is not a single coin which can combine all of those, but there are tons of coins which just are fast and cheap (often mainly because nobody is using them), but they lack everything else. 
Ethereum is a platform for decentralized applications and not a store of value or currency, so it's does not compete directly with what bitcoin was made to be. (On the other hand bitcoin will be able to run the same dapps like Ethereum on sidechains like Rootstock, while still having the bitcoin blockchain as security in the background).

You certainly sound like a concern troll from r/btc, which also makes sense after quickly checking your history, but I'm still gonna waste my time here.


You obviously still don't understand how lightning works. You don't open channels to every merchant directly. If you have a channel with me and I'm with steam and amazon you can pay steam and amazon through me. Who should pay YOUR channel opening fee? Me, or steam and amazon because you can pay them although you aren't even directly connected? Whoever started using the word "locked" for lightning obviously didn't anticipate the missuse of it by anti lightning people. In the current banking system the money is actually really locked. With a mature lightning network it makes more sense to say your funds are freed, because you will be able to pay almost anyone within milliseconds for a few satoshis.


What exactle is an incoming channel? Lightning is bi-directional, you can pay in both directions. As a merchant I probably would open channels with a few different trustworthy hubs. It takes me a few bucks (which is nothing compared to banking costs and international transfers) and they can stay open as long as I'm doing my business.

Crypto needs more people to believe in the tech instead of "investing" to get rich or make fast gains. He might have exaggerated when he said he loves it, but what I believe his point is, is that price just does not matter at this point. It's about the tech and it's progress.

@_date: 2017-10-16 23:32:18
View the blockchain as a train track. In an event like this, the blockchain (tracks) split on a certain point and they both go different ways from that moment on, their history is the same though. That's why you have coins on both chains if you had bitcoin before the split. If you buy them after the split you can just buy them on one of those new "tracks" at a time, so you can't have both for the price of one.
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:00:49
For people with little time: At 5:19 he talks about bitcoin.
I don't know how that is, but he is right and it's a good summary for beginners who don't know anything about bitcoin. It's just important to understand that what he says does not apply to any cryptocurrency, but just to a truly decentralized one which can be argued to be only bitcoin.

I don't understand your first paragraph. How is lightning a travesty? Lightning enables micropayments, even on subsatoshi levels, today. Lightning is in beta status for only a few months and it already has an existing and working network.
Value wise it wouldn't be much of a difference if bitcoin is used as a currency or as a global standard of value which can be used for backing new or other currencies or just as a store of value, but that's not the point. Forks and altcoins are legitimately hated by people who understand the meaning and reason why bitcoin exists. It does not make sense to have a centralized blockchain and the truth is that 99% of those 1648 altcoins are heavily centralized and only exist to make money. Not everything has to be decentralized, but a new form of money and hedge to the current global financial system has to be, otherwise it would make no difference. You also don't need a blockchain and your own token for everything, it makes absolutely zero sense (besides earning easy from stupid people). It's just fashionable to write blockchain on a new product today, because people will shove their money up your ass. It makes sense for the companies and devs, but it doesn't make the world any better.
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:56:55
Maybe, but it also could diminish public perception of bitcoin, even if their concerns weren't valid. That could play into the hands of governments and banks who could use that to launch or promote their own shitcoin.

That's not how he phrased it. He said the lightning network **can** do millions of tps today. I'm not an expert so I can't say how many transactions per second my node could process, but I am fairly certain I would be able to send hundreds of thousands single satoshi payments via lightning within a not too big timeframe.
So calling it a lie is wrong, I'd prefer your first comments "inaccurate", because the lightning network obviously wouldn't be able to handle millions of tps if it comes to retail payments. On the other hand if there were a way to utilize those single satoshi payments (besides that pixel website) it wouldn't even be inaccurate.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:49:58
Because if you send just a part of your paperwallet (which is not supported by all wallets I know anyway) and don't specify a change address your remaining bitcoin will be added as mining fee as far as I understand it.
Another problem would be if you import your private key into a wallet and spend a part from it. People who don't understand how bitcoin works might think the remaining bitcoin will still be on their initial paperwallet and maybe delete their wallet they used because it was just a one time payment or whatever. 
Always sweep your paperwallet if you don't exactly know what you are doing.

It's certainly not expensive enough to justify abusing satoshis work to rip people off by demanding 999$ for this.

Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, so there is always a delay until new (or lost) hashpower is accounted for. Since the hashrate is going up most of the time the actual average block time is slightly below 10 minutes. So a constantly raising hashrate certainly has an effect on the halving in terms of the date, but I don't have any numbers for that.
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:11:43

@_date: 2018-07-18 13:51:58
You don't seem to understand that being fast and cheap are not main priorities if it comes to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is all about independence, censorship resistance and decentralization. As far as I know there is no cryptocurrency which has those properties while also being fast and cheap. Being fast and cheap is not very complicated if you have a company or some central party behind a coin who can run it how they like. If you show me a coin which is able to scale to mass adoption today without having a central party behind it, please let me know. Bitcoin devs have a very wise approach of improving the network, trying to make it more efficient (segwit, schnorr, mast etc.), working on second layer solutions and sidechains while keeping the base layer and its fundamental properties safe and strong.
Besides that, Bitcoin will also be very fast and cheap with lightning. It actually is already. I bought some steam games just for fun via lightning and it worked perfectly.

If you wouldn't be able to hold or use bitcoin if you don't manage everything yourself, do you think that would be a good thing? You and I, we choose to be independet and trustless, but other people might not want to be and big players might not want to risk millions or billions worth of bitcoin and rather have professionals secure them and be insured at the same time.

Maybe we both are right in some way. If someone buys bitcoin on coinbase and then uses it to buy stuff from a bitcoin merchant you have to admit that it has to at least something with bitcoin, even if it's not the best way to use it.

It might not be the case anymore and probably just works this way if you construct a transaction manually. I also wouldn't rule out that there are bad wallets out there behaving like this.


That's basically the first thing you should learn when using bitcoin, but it doesn't make my point less valid.


I don't understand your point. I said people might think their stuff is still on their paperwallet, so backing up their wallet might not seem necessary for them. If someone was to send the whole amount to his own wallet it's self-evident that backing up that wallet is a good idea since your bitcoin are on THAT wallet now, but it has nothing to do with sweeping a paperwallet per se.
It seems like you are just arguing for the sake of arguing. I don't have time for that now. Good night.

Posting memes and caring about price doesn't make you toxic. You obviously don't visit r/btc often or check out posts and comments which are pro bitcoin. BCH or big block proponents get treated very differently here than Bitcoiners in r/btc. In r/btc first thing that happens is you getting cryptochecked, therefore pubicly ridiculed, insulted, downvoted into oblivion and accused of being part of a big conspiracy. Devs, companies, more prominent advocates of bitcoin get heavily insulted, misrepresented or just maliciously lied about all of which usually lands on their front prage.
So no, r/bitcoin is not just "toxic" as well. Everyplace has some kind of toxicity, obviously, but r/btc is a special kind of place, in a negative sense.

Thousands of years? The average life expectancy for a fiat currency is 27 years, with the shortest life span being one month. Founded in 1694, the British pound Sterling is the oldest fiat currency in existence.  
The British pound was defined as 12 ounces of silver, so it’s worth less than 1/200 or 0.5% of its original value. In other words, the most successful long standing currency in existence has lost 99.5% of its value.

They got donated almost 16 bitcoin in the last 8 months and assuming that the people running this website are probably worth millions themselves it doesn't seem necessary to sell you out for 20k a month, unless you might profit in other ways. It's a shame.

You seem to know what you are talking about. How does mining on RSK actually work? Are there any benefits of mining a sidechain or does merge mining not affect a bitcoin mining operation at all? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:39:51
I'm telling you they do. 
James Dimon also agrees
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:29:09
I agree with everything but the last sentence. I think it's better if people have their bitcoin on coinbase than having none. It is basically the same as now, but with the difference that people are holding (or letting coinbase hold...) bitcoin and not a fiat currency which can be printed as governments or banks like. Money that shifts value and wealth from fiat to bitcoin is important.
Would it be better if everyone controls their private keys? Yes, but that's unrealistic at this time and not necessary in my opinion. We can agree to disagree in that regard. I do get your point and where you stand and I actually agree with everything, just the timeframe and the way it should or can happen is different.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:38:55
Yeah there are some explanations. I came up with my own theory in my edit. I remember being decently confused because my channelbalance kept and still keeps changing continuously.

That dude's website has "bitcoin core" ranked as a shitcoin. I'm wondering why someone like that would put a lot of funds into lightning at that early stage. If it's a comedy website I don't understand that kind of humor, but a website like that actually would have potential.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:28:43


So there is one who claims it! Doesn't sound plausible to me though. If I'm not mistaken that means he routed about 2 million transactions in 1 week.
Edit: I thought about it and I think the problem could be that he might be relying on the "lncli channelbalance" numbers. As far as I now (also consistent with my experiences) the channelbalance actually changes with the mempool, because lnd always keeps enough reserve for closing channels if necessary. My balance is fluctuating between 600.000 and 800.000 satoshi. That could explain his numbers.
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:43:01
I'm not saying it's a valid reason, but it is what it is. People are selfish and greedy. If everybody on the world were nice and accommodating we wouldn't have war and murders. I generally agree with you, but I'm not mad or surprised bitcoin and it's trustless nature is not welcomed by powerful people. It will be up to the users (and I'm mainly talking about the younger generation, not my or your parents who probably aren't able to truly secure their own coins) to eventually force the change you and I hope for.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:22:20
If it's insured and taken care of by professionals it does help everyone who wants to be part of this revolution but can't because they are overwhelmed on a technical level. Your vision would exclude a large portion of the population. Besides that Bitcoin as an open source protocoll is free for anyone to use how they like, so if there is demand for custodial services it will happen anyway.
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:26:40
But that's part of the process. I'm not talking about the technical challenges, but the social ones. Old CEOs grown strong in the old system most certainly won't want to switch and change. I believe it will be the task of a younger generation to accelerate the shift. Work yourself up to CEO and do it yourself!
@_date: 2018-07-15 00:08:12
It might be possible to link bitcoin to previous thefts or hacks, so exchanges could be reporting you to authorities if you somehow get your hands on those or they even refuse to offer their services to you because of the history of your coins. I haven't heard of that happening yet though.

I don't gloss anything. It's just a matter of trust/freedom and convenience. If someone chooses to sacrafice the former for the latter they are free to do so. I also don't agree that they don't use bitcoin, they just use it in another way and with a service someone provides. The same as you also use USD or Euro if you use a creditcard or using the lightning network instead of onchain transactions.

I doubt we are going anywhere near 5000 before there is a decision from the SEC about the CBOE ETF. People will be speculating on a positive outcome like last year and price will propably rise until the decision. If they approve it bitcoin will probably go higher, if it's declined we might go lower.
Also you might want not to use "for sure" if you actually can't know what's happening unless you are a whale and you can dump it on your own.

independence or decentralization is not binary. It's better to have more than less. Obviously it's very hard (or maybe impossible) to have a working society without some sort of government or rules, but with bitcoin you have definitely more freedom and control over your money and the government and banks have less control and knowledge about you. You can go where you want and take everything with you without much of a hassle and pretty much without anyone knowing how much you have if you did it right. Nobody can take it from you without force. Not even North Korea could stop people from using bitcoin since it's also usable via radiowaves or satellite. If a government starts waterboarding millions of people for their bitcoin, I think we have bigger problems to worry about than just financial freedom. 
There are some people already living only with bitcoin and without bank account. might have more insight on how it works.

Closing a channel is part of the smart contract running on the bitcoin blockchain. Just because it's not immediately published on the bitcoin blockchain doesn't make it an altcoin or anything else.

That might be true, but Bitcoin is an open and free protocoll, so you can do whatever you want. If you want to trust someone with your bitcoin because you don't want to be responsible for your own security you can totally do that, or you can be your own bank and be as trustless as possible.

@_date: 2018-04-03 14:01:18
You just don't seem to understand that Bitcoin offers a choice. Bitcoin CAN be anonymous (even more so with the lightning network, nobody except the payee can tell who send a payment), Bitcoin CAN be 100% safe and unhackable. You also don't have to store it on a paperwallet which would render it "useless" in your terms. Using a hardware wallet is extremely safe and convient for everyday usage.  It's not a fantasy that Bitcoin is more secure, because it just is. Having a central authority does not make it safe neither does having an option to charge back. If you choose to store your bitcoin at a bank one day, or now at an exchange you are trading security and independency for convenience. 
Besides that the main point of bitcoin is not having a central authority who has control over the protocoll in terms that it can change the foundations without consensus. It does beyond bitcoin as a currency.
If you can't see any value in an open and decentralized ledger which **nobody** can manipulate or censor, I don't think there is any sense in discussing the use of bitcoin further.

Because it's about satoshi per byte. Transaction aren't always the same size. It depends on how many inputs you have. Your other transaction was probably smaller and therefore the fee per byte was higher. I paid 40cent fee lately for a transaction and it was 180sat/byte.

So he owned a company which owned his stuff and someone impersonated him with fake ID and fake documents and they changed the president of his company and basically stole real estate and other stuff worth millions. He then proceeded to take a lawyer who then scammed the scammer and him at the same time. Turns out the lawyer was in prison before and got his license while in prison.
Not sure how accurate that summary is, will try to find the interview.

You never owned those bitcoin in the first place. Having an unconfirmed transaction just means that someone want's to send you bitcoin, but it won't be final until a miner puts it into a block (1st confirmation). If that doesn't happen then the bitcoin just stay where they were in the beginning.

That's why merchants usually wait for at least a few confirmations before accepting the payment. If you send bitcoin to a friend it's obviously not necessary if you trust each other, but if you do online business with random people that's not a good idea.

On your paperwallet there should be a qr code which should be named "public address or deposit address" or something similar and one "private address or private key, or spend". Don't scan the private key (that's just if you want to send the bitcoin somewhere else), just the public address and put it in the search field at blockchain.info. It will show you the current balance.
I also would not import your paperwallet anywhere, just keep it safe and maybe make a copy and store it somewhere safe.

It's important to know that you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin aswell. 1 Bitcoin is currently dividable up to 1/100 millionth of a bitcoin, thats 0.00000001 also called 1 satoshi.
So if you want to buy 100$ worth of bitcoin, or even 20$ or 3500$, it's all possible.
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:08:47

No I didn't, but 100.000 per bitcoin would already mean some kind of mass adoption, meaning that bitcoin hasn't failed and isn't likely to fail anymore. I don't think a slow growth in adoption from 100.000 to 1 million per bitcoin is less likely than a successful mass adoption in the first place.

It doesn't just seem so, it was pretty much confirmed by obvious spam transactions which didn't have any other purpose than filling blocks. That said, Bitcoin has to be able to deal with that, because everyone can spam like that if he wants, there is no censoring or blocking them, fortunately.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:27:29
There are a few things like MAST and Schnorr which will improve the overall throughput and efficiency without raising the blocksize. For LN there is a lot of stuff coming which will reduce the space needed for opening lots of channels. You can open several lightning channels with one on-chain transaction and you will also be able to refund existing channels without closing them first. If absolutely necessary I'm pretty sure there will be sufficient consensur for a moderate blocksize increase in the future. Wouldn't be surprised if someone somehow finds a truly safe way to do this so we don't end like shitcoin cash.
Also you have to understand that there is no "solution" to scaling which happens at one point. Like with the internet and its infrastructure, bitcoin will be improved along the way while it gets more usage. 56k was fast enough 25 years ago, 1mbit was a revelation when I finally was able to download some games within few hours instead of downloading 1mb parts overy night just to have my download disappear because someone was calling. Today I stream 4k movies and download 50gb games or the bitcoin blockchain within few hours. It's a neverending process.

Great interview and very informative. As someone who runs a lightning node for over a year now I still learned quite a lot, and I'm just half way through. Christian Decker is always someone I like to listen to, great guy and dev.
One suggestion for you though. I think you should stop calling it "lightning bitcoin". Less technical people could misinterpret that as some sort of altcoin or something different than a "normal bitcoin" and that also plays into the hand of some trolls who don't like bitcoin, but lightning is actually just a different way to send bitcoin. I would prefer if you would say "bitcoin on the lightning network" or something similar. Otherwise good job.

Bitcoin can't just disappear. If you swiped it with Mycelium and the address on the paperwallet says the blanace is zero, the bitcoin has to be on another address. Unless your phone got hacked (which is unlikely) and it got sent to another address it has to be on your phone. With your paperwallet you could check the transaction and see which address has the bitcoin on it.
I hope you have written your mycelium seed on a piece of paper, so you can recover that wallet on another phone and check the balance.

They need the hardware which isn't easy to get and the need LOTS of electricity without anyone noticing it. I doubt it's trivial to run such an operation to get 51% hashpower where you actually have 51% of the hardware in your possession. Even if someone would be able to do this, what could they actually do? Some double spends, mining empty blocks or censoring transactions? They can't take away anyones bitcoin. Worst case is a hardfork to a new mining algorithm which renders the whole investment to be worth zero.
So no, that wouldn't hurt bitcoin in the long run, but it would cost a lot of money and it would show people that not even a goverment can stop bitcoin. It would just cost them a lot of money without having accomplished anything. It would also make that government look weak.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:07:57
Right, taxes != income tax. Because there are many other ways you get screwed by the government, thanks for claryfing that.
If it were reasonable to form a corporation for tax purposes we would do so, but its not.
Your last "argument" makes absolutely no sense. Justifying 55% tax just because you already have enough is just stupid. That's what people say who borrow money from wealthier people and don't want to pay back "because it doesn't matter to you anyway".

Millions of dollars in bitcoin, right? If they would want to sell it quickly before the price plummets they would crash it themselves by swamping the market.

Why do you people would never buy stuff just because bitcoin gains purchasing power over time? Do you buy a new smartphone or TV because your dollar loses in value or because you just want a new phone or TV?
How much % is there to gain once the whole world works with bitcoin? It's hard to predict, but it won't be a lot, because bitcoin gains value with bitcoin being lost or destroyed over time and if the world economy gets processed mainly in bitcoin people will probably be very careful not to lose it and we also will have different security mechanisms than today.
Bitcoin would however take power away from governments and banks who can print money and finance wars or drain away wealth from their citizens at their will.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:51:10
As far as I know mycelium doesn't save the private key of a paper wallet. If the paperwallet said balance 0 then your bitcoin should have been sent to somewhere else. In mycelium you have the option to send the paperwallet directly to another address which is not related to mycelium, or you could send it to your mycelium wallet. It's hard to tell if you don't have the transaction id.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:29:46


It's quite obvious I didn't mean that nobody would buy anything anymore. I thought it is obvious in that context. It's about people not buying anything but bread and water and the most necessary stuff, because Bitcoin goes up in value. Sounds more like your arguments can't hold water if you need to come up with this sentence to attack me personally.


However, if technology would get cheaper by an unknowable value every year, every month, maybe every week you'd be a fucking fool to buy anything unless you really really need that thing. This month you are able to buy a great TV for 5000$, but next year you can buy an 8k Microled TV for the same amount or less. Same goes for basically anything on this world.
Your argument is weak, because people very likely won't be stopping buying stuff they don't need even when bitcoin goes up steadily 2% a year for the same reason I personally don't buy a new TV or a new phone because of inflation. Do you spend your money on those things because of inflation? People want stuff, people buy stuff. We don't live in the 1920s anymore, we have a vastly different consumer culture today and I doubt Bitcoin would change it. Yet it would be easier to save and preserve value longterm if one desires to do so.


Why does someone need to "catch up", what does this even mean? Is it easier to "catch up" for poor people to millionaires or billionaires today? If you do something for society or produce something of value you get bitcoin. If you don't produce something of value you will eventually spend your bitcoin and have non left. You have to be productive to earn bitcoin. Having lots of bitcoin early doesn't mean anything in the long run. Having a monopoly on printing money on the other hand gives you an unfair edge, wouldn't you say?


If you really believe that those few people who have the monopoly on printing money won't abuse that power to conserve their own power, wealth and enrich themselves further you should start to open your eyes to reality and human psychology. It buffles me that you think of banks and goverments financing war or doing shady and illegal stuff to gain power and money as a conspiracy. You better be out if you really do.


We live in a world of representative democracy and hardly in a direct democracy. Every politician elected is a consequence of canvass and lying. Especially the system in the US seems to be the most undemocratic democracy in the western world. As far as I know clinton actually had more people voted for her than for trump, yet he won the election. People vote for people who then decide basically what they want. I certainly can be happy to live in central europe with a government which is a great one compared to other real shitholes, but does it mean it's actually great? Not in my opinion, there is too much shady stuff going on here.

TCP/UDP are about 40 or 50 years old and still around. Bitcoin is an open source protocoll, if there is something vastly superior it will adapt and integrate the technology, but there isn't.  People will build stuff around and on top of bitcoin. The shitcoin you are interested in (whichever it is) is useless, centralized and will die sooner or later.
Also it's funny you request "coherent arguments" when everything you said is pure bullshit without any substance.

I'm pretty sure it's not legal if you just keep them and even more morally condemnable if you don't and I hope they will take legal actions against you if you feel it's their fault and you don't have to pay it back. Why can't you just send those extra bitcoin back, did you buy something with it?

At what fee level would implementing segwit and batching be important enough? There is still half a megabyte to be gained from just using segwit which would bump the capacity quite a bit. Also some big players still don't batch their transactions. Both is possible today without any change to bitcoin.
Why should we set a precendent in that matter that doing a dangerous and rushed hard fork is preferable to improving efficiency without the need of a hard fork?

I'm not sure how you came up with that and how that should be relevant to this discussion. I never said that my time is worth much more or that I work harder for more money than other people. That doesn't change my opinion that the income taxes and taxes in general are too high here.
The rest you said might be true, but that's true for every country with more reasonable taxes than austria. I'm doing my part by voting for the people who I believe have better ideas.
I also realize that there might not be a single country on earth where I could have a better life than here (besides paying less taxes elsewhere). I appreciaite my country and everything I have here, but that doesn't mean it's not possible to change it for a better.
btw. not sure if you are from austria, but if you are you could take a look at a tv show called "bist du deppert" on puls4 if you don't know that already. The things they show there is why I'm not comfortable paying so much in taxes to people who seem to have no respect for other peoples money. (I know it's way worse elsewhere on the world, but that can't be a reason to not get better yourself)

Having 3tps or 15tps doesn't matter if your goal is a few tousand tps, that's what I call scaling. Having a 0,4€ fee for a transaction if your tps limit isn't close to be reached also doesn't sound like good scaling.

If you use a passphrase to secure your paperwallet and have at least 2 copies on different places (which isn't possible with 20k cash, would be nice though) it's as secure as it can get, if you know how to make a proper paperwallet.
A backup of your trezor seed is also not more secure from theft than a paperwallet, but a hardware wallet is obviously way more convenient to use.

I don't think it's that easy. Someone has to manage that stuff. What if most people don't want to pay for that, who is allowed to use the highway, if it's just for some people who enforces the "law"? It might work in a smaller scale, but now for a whole country.
In the end it would be the same as a government.

I agree, but it's still optional. You are forced to pay while you are here and consume what this country provides with it's taxes, that's true, but here we have to freedom to leave if we want. I think it's necessary to have some rules which the majority agree to, like we all agree that murder is bad and should be punished, even if some people might disagree (maybe not the perfect analogy, but I think you get what I mean).
I appreciate it too, have a nice day!

It's obviously very much subjective, but I doubt there are many 1st world countries where people are safer, wealthier and healthier than in europe, and that's what people usually want (reasonable assumption).

By saying "enough" I meant enough to be in the 55% bracket, not that they already have enough money so it doesnt matter. If you were to say that, everyone earning more than he needs to survive has already more than enough money.
We do have a significant income, although we aren't in the 55% bracket, but paying 50cent for every € (above 90k) we make just doesn't seem right.
I know those who decide are just normal people, but the main problem is that those people very very often have no practical experience about stuff they decide about. For small companies  it gets more and more difficult to survive, because they government makes it harder with every change they make. We aren't directly affected, but we work with other companies who are.
People being corrupt certainly isn't a problem for the government alone, but it's still a big problem.
My main point is: It's perfectly possible to maintain our current standards while letting the people keep more of their hard earned money.

Usually wallets ask you to write down the seed as soon as you create a wallet, not sure about mycelium though. 
You are screwed if you can't recover your phone. You either need the mycelium seed to recover your wallet or access to your wallet on your broken phone, otherwise you can't access your coins.

Another ad hominem attack, point for me I guess.
Either you don't understand my point or you actually try to weasle your way around it. Your example means that you only spend as much as Bitcoin will go up in value over time. That's fine and you won't lose overall wealth, why is that a bad thing? Do you think the whole world will change their spending behaviour like that? I already told you that I believe this is not the case. People still will buy new cars, or a new yacht, or a new house or whatever. You can live like a poor man keeping your wealth for future generations who will eventually spend it, or you spend what you have and have a better life. In any case in the long run there is a set amount of Bitcoin and if you don't invest them or do something with them you will have none left. Also I believe it's quite silly to pursuit an everlasting economic growth. You don't have to be a mathematician to understand it can't work like that. It might be necessary to an inflationary currency in our debt based society, but just because it is like that now doesn't mean it's the best system. It works until it won't and I'm not the only one who thinks that a major incident is due.
That said I'm done with "discussing" with you. You pick out single sentences out of my comments, disregarding my answers and then picking another sentence out again. Rinse and repeat. You probably would do this until I stop replaying. Which is exactly what happens now.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:17:40






That's my point, it just doesn't matter. Also, what do you base your double up on? Do you think people upgrade from a 980ti to a 2080ti today, but won't when bitcoin is around?


What would bitcoin make go up in value when there is hardly room to grow in acceptance? Lost and destroyed Bitcoin. It's fair to assume that security and awareness will get much better than it is today. Most of all lost Bitcoin were lost during the early days when they were worth nothing. People would format their harddrives losing thousands of bitcoin, because they just didn't care. I hardly doubt that we will lose enough bitcoin yearly to make its value go up 25%, that's just insane. It's absolutely nonsensical to believe that the annual number of lost Bitcoin will go up rather than down. It's not just speculation, it's an educated guess.






First of all why do you think we have to close the wealth gap or inequality? When humanity came around it was actually very equal and I would bet that even if we distribute all the wealth on earth equally on all humans today, within a few years it wouldn't look to much different than it is today. Some people are smarter than others, some people prefer to save and some prefer to spend their money. That's not Bitcoins fight to fight. Not having a chance and abusing monopoly or power is something different. Bitcoin can't change everything, but it certainly would be better and more equal.
"Now imagine your money doesn't just earn extra money by investing, but by simply excising."  That's just so wrong I can't even. 1 Bitcoin won't make you another extra Bitcoin when just sitting around. It might appreciate in value over time, but even if you have 10k Bitcoin, if you do nothing with it but spending, you will have less Bitcoin and spend them all in the long run. If you chose to live in a small flat, buying nothing in your life because it gains in value over time, that's also fine. Your descendants will thankfully spend them for you at some point. In the end people or families who won't be productive will have spent all their Bitcoin at some point.
Want to have MORE Bitcoin? Well then you have to invest them, risk them and do something with it. It's quite straightforward.






Wow, I thought Bitcoin solves all problems on earth, thanks for telling me that it won't. Besides that the EU also outlawed certain drugs and other illegal stuff, but guess what, it's still around and a big business. Bitcoin especially can't be stopped, people will use it anyway and if it turns out that Bitcoin will stay and get bigger and bigger goverments and countries that didn't outlaw it, but worked with it will have an edge over goverments that did. It's highly unlikely that all goverments will have an unanimous opinion about Bitcoin when we can't even agree on working together against the climate change which directly effects our ability to live in this planet.

I switched from running it on a rented rootserver to running a bitcoin and lightning node on a raspberry pi in my house a few weeks ago. Figured that was the way to go. The original node is still online until the contract with the server provider runs out, but I closed all channels.
More people opened a channel with my old node, but the routing fees are negligible anyway. Routing 100 payments or none doesn't really make any difference.

If the state wouldn't use tax money for healthcare and similar services people who can't afford it would be left untreated like in the US, that's not how we want europe to be. I'm not against social services for people who, for whatever reason, have problems in their lives, I'm just against exploitation of said services, corruption and waste of tax money. Unfortunately that's how humans are and I'm pretty sure it's not going to change anytime soon.

You also shouldn't just say they are unsafe. It might be more difficult and complicated to do it right, but I think for people who know what they are doing it is possible to generate,validate and use such paper wallets without risk. The link he posted about javascript generated keypairs which use a worse rng also doesn't seem to be a problem anymore as he says in the video. Also there are different independend ways to verify that everything is working as it should. Instead of saying they are safe or unsafe you should say it's very hard to do it right, so better get a hardware wallet unless you understand all implications of those paper wallets.
That said, although I used and still have such paper wallets I wouldn't make new ones, just because it's way more convenient to use my trezor.
