It's been almost a week now, still the bitcoin is neither in my wallet nor where i transfered it. Do you perhaps have any suggestion?
@_date: 2016-08-02 11:08:59
I rescanned it, but it still doesn't showed up, do you perhaps know another thing i can try?
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:16:33
Nevermind i found the solution:
TL;DR put "-zapwallettxes" (without the ") after "target" in properties of bitcoin core wallet shortcut
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:04:17
I use the bitcoin core wallet, but i don't see a rescan option.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:44:08
Yeah I'm afraid I'll do something wrong.
But looking at the stuck btc it has 20.355 sat/B, and if you use [this site] ( you'll see *a  lot* of transactions above it. Could this realistically take months before it is finally send? Or even more?
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:37:50
The wallet I'm using.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:47:23
I've already send anther BTC to the same address, with a higher fee so the amount was less than the stuck btc. This did not help the stuck transaction, do I need an even higher fee? What is the minimum I can send to "activate" CPFP?
Transaction ID:
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:25:08
Yeah, I'm afraid so. Honestly I don't want to try it because I would probarbly fuck it up. But the stuck btc has 5.089 sat/WU, so i would guess it will be stuck for a loooooooong time. And then, randomly, one day it suddenly deducts from my wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:57:49
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:07:57
Ah thanks! I didn't know there was a new version, I was still using 14.2.


Also, where does this suddenly come from (just curious)? I never linked bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:57:39
Thanks, I did look it up. The thing is, the original transaction was send with the "deduct fee from amount" option. So I was wondering what I would enter as amount, if that would be the 1 btc minus the fee (I tried sending 1 btc again with the deduct fee, but then the amount is different so it went through as a different transaction).
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:51:59
Luckily I have plenty of storage, but at least you can say you are a part of the Bitcoin network!
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:02:07
I think basically more miners are singalling SegWit, and those wo don't are overtaken by those who do.
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:02:44
Alright, thanks! Will keep an eye out for an update.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:32:54
Thanks for your quick response!
But if I run both how does it (BU node) "know" I also have the same amount in BU? Do I have to import the Core wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:45:51
Thanks, luckily I hadn't begon the proces the other descriped.
But if i hold BTC on an exchange, like Kraken, then I do immidiately get the other coins (if Kraken is accepting them)?
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:28:36
Thanks for the video, but unfortunately I need something more ELI5ish. Will check out the subreddit though!
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:28:59
So if I don't do anything then I will not support it?
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:59:01
Oh, does that mean that I can "vote" for using/not using SegWit? Sorry for the noob question.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:00:46
Yes that's exactly what I was thinking, sell 'm while the're still worth something.
Another question if you don't mind, if the hard-fork happens, does that mean that the non-BU coins will have SegWit implemented?
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:50:32
Isn't it only possible to buy those coins if a hard-forked had happened? Now there's just Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:34:01
And can I also do that *after* the hardfork happened? Asking just to be sure.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:23:42
EDIT: Nevermind, anything older than 0.13.1 does indeed support SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:16:48
Well i have the space anyways, the only problem would be if i reinstalled my operating system.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:19:48
Hey me too! When i started around 2013 i also started with the core client. I also like the option of "subtract the miners fee from transaction", so whenever i sell a bitcoin i can sell a whole.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:13:54
Aha thanks for your answer!
So if i understand it correctly, if i have the space and i understand how it works, the core client is "better" than the other?
EDIT: Also, check check double check, if i've made a backup of my wallet once using the core client, i don't have to back it up again after i make a transaction right?
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:24:43
Oh yeah that's right, forgot about that! I think i even have a blockchain of 60GB somewhere on a external hard drive :)
Also space is not really a problem, i bought a cheap 1TB HDD for my multimedia, but i don't even use half of the storage and that includes the full blockchain.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:26:45
I used it immediately when i started a couple years back but didn't find it *that* complicated though. But then again, i like to find new stuff and figure out how it works.
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:44:06
Not sure actually, could i potentially lose bitcoins this way? Or just the transaction history?
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:50:54
Ow, does that mean that if i do not backup occasionally that i can loose bitcoin? I'm running 0.13.1 but i still want to know out of curiousity.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:23:01
Yes you can, my synced blockchain is 116GB.
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:33:09
Ah thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:40:14
Do you mean for like evidence in regards to paying taxes? Because personally i don't really care about those transactions since i write them myself down in excel, plus they are throwaway adresses.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:15:46
Thanks for your answer!
Like i said in the post that the space it needs is a con, but if i have that space anyways this is one of the best clients?
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:36:17
Thanks! In your first post you said "since you have to regularly back it up. Those backups (and the process of obtaining them) is a security headache."
What do you mean by that? Because if i backup my wallet that is a one time thing right? I don't have to back it up again when i make a transaction? Or do you mean that the problem is backing up the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:19:08
Ah thanks for the answer. I do realise that the governemnt is there for the people, but they can use propoganda type measures to ensure people don't trust Bitcoin. There are a lot of people who would believe them because "They are the government, why would they lie".
It's just speculation, though, from my part. It's just that when someone says this to me I don't really know how to answer it so I thought I'd give you the worst case scenario.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:42:24
Thanks for your response!
Maybe I worded it wrong, I meant that the transaction did go through only it is in "pending" and not "available" (bitcoin core wallet). I assume that transaction can't be returned since it is already confirmed that my host should receive it?
Also not sure if it is a typo but I want to claim bch, not btc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:48:39
Alright tanks!
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:10:15
Is there another way then ABC? Because i installed it but it said the blockchain is corrupt and now i have to download the whole blockchain again which takes a long time and BCH is tanking.
@_date: 2016-09-17 20:32:53
Something strange happened where it send 1 BTC by itself but i think that was a bug/glitch. I was just curious, because that would be a quick way to add extra security.
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:10:41
Does it matter to what address, as they will return both? Also do i lose the minders fee it costs to double spend?
EDIT: nevermind did this: 
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:05:27
I don't know that's why i'm posting here, maybe that someone knew the answer.
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:35:07
But doesn't the person need the password? If i change the password now, would the other (possible stolen) wallets be useless?
Also it was send without miners fee, so it is still unconfirmed, is there anything i can do?
EDIT: I mean the password of my bitcoin wallet
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:10:16
Alright, thanks!
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:54:00
It was send as a whole, without miners fee, so it is still unconfirmed.
@_date: 2016-09-24 09:31:09
A little late but no worries, was just curious
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:05:32
Welp, if it wasn't strange, i wouldn't have posted it here. Also what should i say instead of "a Bitcoin" and "an address you your Kraken account"? I think those are pretty self explained.
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:06:36
So you can still use old wallets if you know the password before you changed it?
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:55:24
I'm not saying/sure that it is a hacker, maybe just a bug of some kind. But still it is weird, yes.
If it is a hacker though, then it would've hacked my kraken account to so i chanched the password there too (to?).
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:16:49
I see your point, and hope so too, but that would be potential loss instead of the 2.5 thousand euro's it actually cost me.
Nevertheless, to the moon!
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:07:05
Yes me too, what a relief! Altough it was "only" 3 BTC it still would be a real shame.
@_date: 2016-07-25 11:43:40
Thanks for your response,
In the core client you can click on a transaction and there you get the transaction information. The first entry is "Status" and there is says "0/unconfirmed".
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:53:23
What does it mean when it gets dropped from the pool? Will the bitcoin simply retour to the sender?
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:00:57
But it doesn't show in my client, so where does it go?
