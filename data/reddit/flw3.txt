hello, the site looks great and i like the idea of buying and reseling origanl photos (rights).
it would also be nice if users could upload a certin amount of their original photos (i saw that you are planing this in the future)
i would certanly use my bitcoin with such a business...first a small amount and all worked ok, and would try with a bigger amount
my btc address: 1As6DkU2fJe1chjMG7o6UFurcuMWQD2rbz
