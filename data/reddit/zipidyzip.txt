Yes! No more fud fears :-). if it drops, just a red line on my screen. Since the beginning of this year, I was expecting a lot of downward pressure on BTC. It's not going to be an easy year but this stage is required for the progress of crypto.

Bcash should stop using RogerV as their mascot, They might even do better.

I don't understand how someone can knowingly cheat/scam 1000s people again and again and still be able to continue scamming more without any consequences. there is a method of signing a petition to remove those ads? How about a Campain to exploit his scammer practices? If we all work together maybe we can make a difference ??

Have anyone noticed the Tether activity and 24hr trading volume?
Market Cap
$2,221,375,552 USD 
190,045 BTC 
Volume (24h)
$2,859,660,000 USD 
244,651 BTC 
Did they print more tether? the volume is more than the total market cap?

Sorry for the big post I tried to post this as a new topic but, I get a bot notification saying this might be related to altcoins.

What rule?
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:01:11
Sorry, My bad. I didn't wanted to discuss about the coin it self just want to state the inevitable. I bet Roger saw this coming :-).
