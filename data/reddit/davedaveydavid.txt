Gotcha. I just think the slash confused me.

I'd never heard of the bitcoin foundation before this interview. They're not so reputable?

Alright thanks. I might do some reading on economics soon. He had a pretty strange way of saying how small the bitcoin economy is.

I don't know much about economics but would like to know more. I was interested in him saying that a trouble of bitcoin is that it's a nonexistent commodity. How does that differ to traditional currencies that happen to have a physical representation?
Also, I did see his point towards the end of the video. The idea that converting from dollars to bitcoin to pay for things adds another step and is less user friendly.
Edit: grammar

Thanks for that link. Showed me some benefits of bitcoin I hadn't thought of before (particularly low cost processing and moving currency out of certain countries).

Yeah that would be quite different! Presumably price volatility and the low number of users is a block to it's adoption?

Does your title mean only bitcoin ATM in Australia? Canberra, Sydney, and Melbourne also have bitcoin ATMs.

u/eggn00dles has some valid points I think. So do you, but you delivered them in such a condescending manner that it distracts from the issues. Your argument isn't helped by the way you attack his/her character. Claiming that op is 'sheltered' or 'ignorant', or any of the other needless attacks, is ridiculous when everything you know about them is just a short comment on reddit that you happen to disagree with. Being haughty isn't a good look.
