Only if you start to fork right now and mine older blocks. It is not impossible at all that someone out there has enough mining power to have secretly forked the blockchain and releases this fork sooner or later.

If there are RBF accepting miners, it is likely that they also will offer a way to submit transactions to them. Bitcoin core acting against the interests of miners is not something that you should rely on if you have a 0-conf accepting business.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:28:44


No, this is not a soft fork - minders with a limit set internally to e.g. 0.7 MB will still build upon 1 MB blocks just fine - they will themselves not produce larger blocks than 0.7 MB though.
It would be a soft fork if miners with a 0.7 MB limit would fork off 1 MB blocks just because these are 1 MB blocks even though they are "legal" according to current mainline Bitcoin rules.

It can be inferred from a lot of other historic events (bitcoin-core changes defaults --&gt; miners switch to new default suddenly) that miners are for the most case completely oblivious about how Bitcoin operates internally. Another example would be that coinbase-only blocks are so rare, nearly no miners offer publicly to include transactions in bulk for a fixed rate or that often merkle trees are NOT filled completely, leading to useless hashing when checking blocks.
People often seem to assume that there are secret patches out there that huge miners use to magically make bitcoin-core useful for miners... apparently they just fire up the node with standard settings and go back to worrying about how to cool their ASICs.

There would have to be some block sizes before to allow for 10 MB blocks... mainly your example is only possible, if the 71 10 MB blocks have lots of 5 MB+ predecessors and the 71 1 MB blocks are adjacent. Apparently in your examples transaction volume wennt down 10-fold, it makes sense to limit block sizes to 2 MB in that case, instead of 5+ MB, allowing for 5-fold increases of the current block size.

This is just a clash of definitions:
Free software = software that according to the rules of the FSF has a license that ensures that the software and its derivatives stays free software. One of these rules are that the source code is visible.
Open source software is a bit weaker: It only means that the source code is visible ("open"), but does not mean that it has to stay this way. There are different interpretations of this term that are a bit stronger, some of them insist that it has to still be possible to modify the code or redistribute it to be considered "open source". This is what the OP is complaining about.
While the source code for Mycelium is "visible" or "available", depending on your definition of "open source", it is or is not "open source software", since the license of the code does not permit any random person out there to just take it, modify it and redistribute it (e.g. on the Google play store for money...). It is definitely not "free software", since free software has an even stricter set of criteria to follow.

There are 2 paradigms to learn imperative programming languages: "Top down" or "bottom up"
Top down would be to learn something like Python (or even Scratch) which is very comfortable to use, you don't have to worry about memory management etc. and can really focus on understanding the basic concepts (to iterate over a list you just write "for item in list: ...) first, then maybe go on to learn languages that expose a bit more of the cogs and wheels behind everything.
Bottom up would be starting to learn e.g. C (not C++) to really get into the idea of "if you want memory, think about how much you want, request it and then write to it", to learn about the importance of proper syntax first and how much fun it can be to have the whole computer's resources right at your fingertips with only the operating system protecting you a bit from crashing the whole machine.
It's like learning to drive in a children's car with automatic transmission (or no transmission) on a closed parking lot or jumping into a Porsche and figuring out how to drive this thing by reading the instruction manual (hopefully you read the section about breaking first and also realize that the hand brakes are in place when you take a seat). Both methods can be fun, it depends on you which one is better.
Harvard for example has their CS50 lectures online ( and they are quite good for introduction (last time I watched them out of interest to see how they do compared to my university).

You only can offer money you own. You can't borrow BTC, sell them and offer the USD without executing the actual trade.
Trading costs more in fees than you can quickly earn in interest and you have the risk that the price goes up much more than you will earn by offering USD (so holding the BTC would have been better).

The 2000 BTC offers are just offers, if you don't already have them lent out before pumping, you just help people who already have FRR loans out there. Bitfinex automatically (for traders) takes the cheapest offers, so if you borrow 2k BTC, then put them back on the market, a lot of them will likely get re-posted at the rate you got them, making FRR the more expensive option, so if you then post 2k offers to FRR, they won't be taken.

Less influence from outliers, harder to influence by bad actors/spammers.
Rolling averages change/oscillate MUCH faster than rolling medians, so a few small blocks can suddenly cause a big impact on block size in the future.
Due to the random nature of mining, a few nearly empty blocks (because 2 blocks are found in quick succession) or some VERY full blocks (because it took long to find a nonce and a lt of transactions accumulated over time) are likely. These whould not influence maximum block sizes in my opinion.
Also I'd increase the multiplier to at least 4 or 8...

Bitcoin and some altcoins are calculating "Proof of Work" - they have some already known data (timestamps, transactions, hash of the previous block...) and add a number to it (called nonce - "number used once"). This number added needs to modify the resulting hash to start with a certain number of zeroes.
A slightly easier example would be if you have a large number and need to add a second number so that the large number is divisible by 17. You then would enter the number in your pocket calculator to see if it is itself divisible by 17 (then the additional number would be 0) or otherwise you'd start to try adding 1, then 2 etc.
While this "divisible by 17" is probably a poor proof of work function (once you do a division, you can infer from the remainder which number you need to add), cryptographic hash functions like SHA256 are VERY hard to predict - so far nobody has published any way to do so in the case of SHA256. If you change a single bit in the input, the output doesn't just slightly change, it changes completely. This means you need to test every single number you want to try and cannot take shortcuts like looking at remainders.


No, SHA256 is just used because it is easy to verify a solution but hard to generate one. Also where should this data be stored?! Everything that goes on the block chain is documented and it would be very weird if a transaction you create would be a "disguised" hash table of decrypted data (this term doesn't even make sense btw.).


No it can't. Miners are optimized to finding these missing numbers, not to calculate complete hashes of random inputs. All they do is get the large known part of a header and spit out potentially interesting nonces (that hash to a large number of leading zeroes). Password cracking works differently.

No, it does act against you however to transmit the transactions in the larger block to other miners. This means you'll have more orphaned blocks by including more than the absolutely necessary minimum (coinbase + any transaction that pays MORE than what you'll loose through the higher orphan rate).

I would love this to be more of a tree hash over transaction inputs/parts so if you add to a TX you can still know that part of it is "yours".
The current solution should work for what most people who send mostly standard transactions need though (a way to track a TX until it has been mined and the TXID thus is fixed).
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:18:05
It affects the amount of data to be transmitted to others (who then will first check its integrity and then forward the block to other nodes). Including transactions increases your orphan rate due to slower propagation. It is suspected elsewhere here, that they just ensure that the merkle tree is completely filled (before there were problems with blocks only containing coinbase) at least, so all computations by other nodes are at least useful.
Just because the mining related stuff in the official client sucks does not mean that there won't be someone out there who does it smarter and earns some money with that.

Because it is not ledger 0, it is ledger 32570. Ripple operates on balances; unlike Bitcoin, which operates on (script) inputs + outputs. This makes it possible to just get a recent balance sheet and start from there, similarly to getting a (pruned) UTXO set and starting to mine in Bitcoin (which makes it possible too to run a full node without downloading any blocks from the past). UTXO sets however are not part of Bitcoin's consensus model (only transactions and previous blocks are in block headers, Ripple has transactions, previous headers AND the account state).
Everything before 32570 still has happened, the transaction database was simply faulty and they (likely) have been lost. If they somehow showed up again, it would be possible to reconstruct the ledgers from 0 - 32569 and push genesis to 0. Right now 32570 is the one we have and likely will be stuck with.

Set up a huge market sell order (partly/fully unfunded) on any centralized or decentralized exchange, then any funds you send there will be sold immediately into the current books. If you want to diversify prices etc., just send to different exchanges in turns or split your transfers.
You still need to receive the fiat yourself though that way, only few exchanges would accept deposits from any random account to your exchange account (as there might be fraud involved) so you often need to ensure that you are only sending from your authorized (bank) account.

Free transactions take time to be transmitted to your connected nodes, time to be verified by these nodes that receive the block before these nodes rebroadcast the block to other nodes (again taking longer for that than with a smaller block and they AGAIN take longer to verify all transactions inside and so on).
This does have a measurable impact on network propagation and compared to the 25 BTC and the few transactions that fit in 1 MB blocks anyways including free transactions or ones that don't cover this price is a gift to the network that miners pay for whatever reasons they have. They are not acting rationally though if they only look to increase their BTC mined. Since they might also be interested in BTC prices which might go up with higher utility (and lower fees...) there are external forces at work of course.
Bottom line though: If you only look at mining itself, free transactions cost miners more than they probably realize.

Yeah, they are quite similar in function to colored coins - however the transaction speed on Ripple for example is orders of magnitude higher than on NXT or Bitcoin (about 5 seconds until a transaction is finalized).
NXT's asset exchange tries to do something similar to what Ripple does for 1.5 years already and there's still much work to be done over there.

You can probably withdraw to Ripple, then deposit back right away with a different destination tag of your target account. This works for both USD and BTC by the way.

No, since including anything beyond the coinbase transactions puts you in a worse position than someone who only mines coinbase transactions. This needs to be compensated by fees.

It still means that for the price to stay stable, people need to buy 30-40 USD worth of BTC extra for every transaction that is made, due to the still incredibly high inflation rate of Bitcoin itself.
It also means that if people want the same amount of hashing power for security reasons in the future and there is no block subsidy any more, they WILL have to pay approx. this amount, as miners earn about that amount in BTC per transaction currently.
I don't see how this should not be called "cost" of a transaction, also you do not suggest a different metric for the "true cost"...

You can also see the reasoning of the vending machine programmer:
Machine seems to be stocked in a wrong way (e.g. someone forgot a single bottle in between 2 bottles).
Soda is cheaper than customer support ("I threw in a WHOLE dollar and I am still thirsty! I'M GONNA SUE YOU!") so better just throw out bottles until one finally arrives at the customer rather than shutting down and let this be handled by a human.

Also: Get a second harddisk (same size or larger), use a low level imaging tool like dd (ideally a version of dd that automatically compares block hashes to ensure your image has been transferred correctly) to create a 1:1 clone of that disk and ONLY operate on that clone.
If you're more serious (and have any suspicion that the original HDD might fail), you'd make a second copy and store that in it's "faulty" deleted state in case you mess up something with the recovery.
Do not recover files on the HDD you deleted them on. If you had no backup, at least now ensure that you have one and only operate on the copy (or the copy of the copy), not the original.

I agree that doing something that involves a lot of scientific breakthroughs in itself is NOT science (e.g. generating a random number using a radioactive source and a geiger counter), however please also consider that "science" does not equal "original research".
Yes, her initial hypothesis stuff was maybe not the best choice (especially the 3rd) or wording, if you look at it like this though, even the Bitcoin whitepaper is just a fancy way of saying "I think it whould be possible to create a digital asset that is issued and transfered in a decentralized way" - "Here's how to do that" - "Yay, it worked, just as I thought".

After the fact maybe - but at which time exactly does one take the observation? Imagine a contract that pays to X if the price is below 500 and to Y if the price is above - and then right at that time of checking the price it moves from 499 to 501. Some oracles will report "below" and some "above" and from their individual views of the world both views are correct (if they are receiving the trade notification later than others for example).

It has cryptographic proof of transactions in headers just like Bitcoin, it additionally(!) has proof for AccountState, which is roughly equivalent to Bitcoin's UTXO set.
It is not based on Bitcoin code, it uses a chain of linked hashed headers just like it though, depending on your definition of "block-chain" this is very much a block chain based solution.

Dude, it was past 3 AM here...
These pages are likely empty because they are about minor details in the current implementation of Ripple. Agreement happens as outlined in the Consensus article + video: If a transaction can be applied to your local view of the ledger, you vote yes, else no. If a majority of your UNL validators vote yes, you already found consensus, if a majority of them votes no, you start to vote no as well, after a treshhold has been reached (50%, then 60% etc.). The information used is just the transactions that are on the network at that moment arranged into a tree, similar to how bitcoin puts them into a Merkle tree. Since there is no coinbase transaction that could be kept secret, every node can and should know every transaction out there.
I thought you want to be able to verify XRP amounts in ledgers and/or build software yourself that can do that. I told you that you need to serialize everything according to the format described in the wiki, that you need to build trees according to the format in the wiki and then you need to hash everything according to the format in the wiki. This is specific enough to build your own software, otherwise I can tell you where to look up the code to do that for you in rippled, if you need a VERY specific implementation to study.
Ripple does NOT have a missing genesis ledger, it is just not ledger 0, so the current genesis ledger is not the earliest one possible. I gave as much specifics as possible, it is seriously frustrating that apparently you do not care that even though a sum of all XRP is included in Ripple's core data structure and every transaction since 32570 is available AND there is open source software out there which you can study/copy/use that can verify all of this for you AND there is documentation out there how to build software yourself to verify this AND there is documentation out there how the system works in more abstract terms. In accounting terms the genesis ledger is the point in time where you book everything from Equity into your accounts.

You didn't list your field of studies or the exact area you write in - it sounds like economics?
I am not of much help in the area of economics (to me it just sounds like "have some nice ideas how something could work, then collect some evidence it might really be like that and call this a theory or principle"), I'd really recommend to talk with your professor and/or colleagues about this though and be objective when approaching something. I doubt that people will like to read "Bitcoin: Why it will be the main form of online payment methods in 'the future'" in a scientific context.
A suggestion for some alternative topics:   
* When prices change rapidly - which exchange is the first one to actually cause this, how fast do others follow?
* Are there external factors that heavily influence Bitcoin prices in USD other than just news? e.g. gold prices, EURUSD markets, week days, moon phases...
* How much does it REALLY cost and which regulations need to be implemented in detail for a business in the US (or your home country) to accept fiat and BTC deposits to let users trade BTC.
* Why is Bitcoin volatile (even though all balances of addresses, inflation rate etc. is known at any point of time), how volatile is it exactly compared to other currencies and how has this volatility developed over time?

Most recent one I could find for Satoshi Dice:






~1 year ago about 50% of all(!) storage for blockchain transactions was for Satoshi Dice's transactions. This likely is less nowadays, as they don't seem to be that popular any more - you can definitely see their impact in global transaction numbers in 2012/2013 though. I agree that it would be interesting to first show how much impact certain practices that might be good to block have before deciding to include such patches.
If people knew that this keeps services from having their transactions forwarded that are responsible for xx% and yy GB of storage with low to no benefit to Bitcoin itself (just like the transactions that are already filtered, like "dust outputs") or misusing fields for things they are not intended for (e.g. putting data, not keys into fields designed to hold keys) which again hurts the protocol by inflating the UTXO set, the patch might be received differently.
I personally also would rather see this implemented upstream, as soon as something that even slightly looks like "filtering" or "censoring" shows up there though, you can already see Redditors reaching for their pitchforks and acting as if they knew what's best for their magic internet money...
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:00:59
Well, what exactly are the measurements you want to take? A lot of research is more concerned with network analysis (how anonymous are users) and so on, from time to time someone wants to "prove" that Bitcoin is either an asset (e.g. "digital gold") or a currency/money but after initial "I want to write stuff, help me!" threads here, there is not much followup.
There are some general overview papers, not a lot in the economic area though.
Also, a lot of measurements that are possible with Bitcoin are not possible with e.g. USD (how long people hold onto their money before they spend it again on average, or how much cash exactly is transferred at any point in time), then again there are similar issues as well, since by far not all transactions take place on the block chain. Bitcoins are nearly exclusively traded on exchanges who do escrow of funds, so you give them to someone else who stores them - or not, see MtGox - and just calculates what portion of the total funds they owe you.
One relatively "easy" topic could be to compare volatility (= how much the price changes over time, either up or down) of Bitcoin prices with other asset or Forex (money) markets, check bitcoincharts.com for very fine grained data on BTCUSD, for the other stuff you might need to search a bit, but there is usually free data available for 5 or even 1 minute intervals.   
Then take this data (e.g. gold, wheat, oil, euros, yen, indian rupees), calculate volatility in Excel, graph it over 1-2 years and then add Bitcoin in there and see if you can infer something from that.

For all we know in Bitcoin block  Satoshi could have owned 50 billion BTC and spent it all on tinfoil hats.

There always will be counter party risk and there are only very few ways around it, some try it via game theoretic approaches - e.g. both parties put a lot of money on the table that gets "burned" if anyone does not follow the contract.
Ripple only transfers **ownership** of the underlying assets, it (like Bitcoin) does not deal with counter party risks. Once you gave away something and only get a balance in return, no matter if it is BTC-China, Coinbase or the Bank of America you are assuming counter party risk. Ripple lets you choose this counter party freely. This is good (free choice) and bad (you can make bad choices, e.g. trusting TradeFortress)
If you want no counter party risk at all, you need to hold an unbacked cryptocurrency (no inherent value, only source of its market price is its utility) like BTC or XRP (or Dogecoin or Litecoin or ...) in its native form. This has benefits and problems on its own. Ripple however is far more transparent for example than most current exchanges, e.g. it is easy to see how many BTC Bitstamp has to have in their wallets to cover all BTC issued on Ripple. It is not easy at all to know how many BTC BTC-China has issued to their customers for trading... one of the main issues that MtGox had after all (a few 100k BTC more in their books than in their wallets).

Bitcoin's white paper does not explain valid transaction types on Bitcoin at all (only how to verify them) and by the way does also nowhere reference that there should be 21 million BTC created. It is mostly concerned with PoW, not with how to run Bitcoin.
The "exactly how the system works" in Bitcoin is documented in the code of bitcoin-core and in the bitcointalk forums as well as in the wiki on bitcoin.it.
I gave you the way HOW EXACTLY you can see for yourself that XRP are deflating in the form of mathematical proof, you can check out  for the allowed types of transactions or see the C++ code for yourself to validate that my proof is correct.

If there is any error or mistake in these claims, feel free to point them out (e.g. the AccountState root hash in 32570 is incorrect and does not represent the balances of all accounts there, here's the program that I used), otherwise this actually is a valid mathematical proof (which you maybe have not seen too many of?) that you can verify yourself or invalidate by posting facts that disprove any of these three claims.

The OP_RETURN field might also work and is likely the 3rd way you had in the back of your mind. :)
Coinbase is only available to miners who assemble and find blocks, sending to invalid addresses is creating unprunable waste imho and OP_RETURN is only a few bytes long... but might be enough for very short messages.

This is about transaction that are actually happening on Bitcoin, not some 3rd party ledgers - and yes, fees are not that high that it wouldn't be relatively cheap to fake high transaction volume by sending BTC quickly between your own addresses.
If you can notice a consistent increase in price if transaction volume goes up ("It's happening!"), it might make sense to invest some into faking volume.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:41:24
There will be at least 1 transaction in every block (called coinbase, issuing the mined 25 BTC to the miner), in this case it will cost 25*450 USD (11250 USD) per transaction. If there were 11250 transactions in every block, they'd cost 1 USD each to sustain the current price.
"The network currently spends 30-40 USD per transaction on average" might be more correct maybe, still there is an upper bound to transactions in a block (1 MB of them) and a lower bound (there has to be at least coinbase).

The subreddit is about all kinds of systems that utilize the Ripple concept by Ryan Fugger (...or Hawala...), the one about ripple.com is @_date: 2014-04-06 22:58:14
It depends what you actually intend to decentralize - Ripple has a decentralized order book/market but still requires escrowed funds.
Doing trades without escrows is hard to do, usually some kind of game theoretical approach (both parties commit to putting a bit more on the table which would get lost in case any party runs away) is suggested. Typically extortion or blackmailing is possible in these scenarios though, also it might be nice for buying half a BTC once in a while, but not for day trading.

Yeah, unfortunately these "seperate systems" (called baseband) are closed source, likely quite buggy, rarely updated (if ever) and have more control over your hardware than the upper layers (Android, iOS, Windows Phone...). If you can deploy some program using SS7 to the baseband processor, it is actually worse than compromising the upper OS.

While you can use Ripple to track debt too I guess, generally it is currently used to track balances of escrowed assets/money.
You can build debt chains in anything, including Bitcoin and of course they can fail. I don't see the connection with Ripple though, you might want to formulate actual examples or questions, then I could give less generic answers to that stuff.

You deposit the BTC at a gateway of your choice (e.g. SnapSwap's btc2ripple or Bitstamp), go to  and send the SEPA transaction that way, or you withdraw using snapswap.eu for example.

Every ledger header contains the hashes for the AccountState tree + a tree of transactions that are applied to the previous ledger's AccountState to reach the current state. This is independently verifiable without trusting anyone but maths. It is actually very similar to bitcoin's block headers...

Code is here (for client, server, charting page, libraries...):  and documentation of the protocol/APIs is at ripple.com.
Ripple Labs also develops a smart contract platform (independently from Ripple) named Codius.


You own your private key, so there's nothing they can do to stop you from transferring XRP. Gateways can freeze IOUs they issued if they didn't disclaim that feature, so a subpoena there could work to hurt you, depending on which gateway(s) you use.


You might be comparing Ripple in its current form with RipplePay (aka. "Ripple classic"), the original idea of Ryan Fugger. While Ripple still can be used to track debt, it currently is predominantly used to track deposited funds at "gateways" (MSPs that offer to issue and redeem balances on Ripple). It's current most common use case would rather be "Alice has 1 BTC.Bitstamp and uses part of it to send 100 USD.SnapSwap to Mike and 100 CNY.RippleCN to Yin".

No, they haven't. They let a single guy look at their stuff who then wrote a blog post about it. This is NOT an audit, does not prove that they actually have Bitcoins to anyone except Andreas and is nothing better than MtGox releasing a statement or MtGox support writing to a customer "we still have BTC".
For example: The internal reporting tool can simply be wrong (it is closed source after all), they could have lied about their cold wallet addresses, the blog is not hosted on https and the text there is not signed by Andreas anyways - on different levels of paranoia you can come up with more stuff that could be wrong.
Again: No signatures/crypto, no trust. If I can trust Andreas and that "internal tool" of coinbase, I don't need to use Bitcoin any more.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous - unless you find lots of people who willingly give away the pseudonym &lt;--&gt; reallife info relationship all you can do is trying to do physical network analysis (e.g. which node was the first to send you a certain transaction) or payment network analysis (e.g. you know addresses and locations of a lot of canadian bitcoiners, so people they interact with are also more likely canadian)
You can on the protocol level only analyze pseudonymous data, sorry - what you want is NOT possible beyond guessing, estimations and a lot of hand-waving (IP addresses recorded by blockchain.info are also not useful at all).

I'll try opening the Bitcoin port on my machine again when header first sync is finally implemented, so at least people get data that they really need and my node is not just serving a full blockchain to someone who is too stupid or lazy to use the torrent file for bootstrapping. I seed the torrent file in the meantime by the way because I believe it helps FAR more than an open full node atm.

Nope, in the block itself they of course have to be included, you are talking about the (fixed size) block header.
Edit: Actually they need to be calculated usually, I doubt that blocks contain intermediate nodes as calculating them is probably much faster than transmitting them. Still this causes a delay and thus increases orphan rates.
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:14:43
There can not be 0 transactions unless there is 0 mining activity going on.
Your argument is just like banks claiming you earn money by depositiong it for 1 year with 0.025% interest. Yes, after 1 year, you will have a larger number of USD at your disposal - BUT this will buy you less than 1 year ago thanks to inflation.
Inflation costs in 1 generation are not that much of a concern to me (I'll be dead by then after all) - Bitcoin right now has still over 10% annual inflation (and will continue so until ~end of 2016) and this is actively devaluating anything I hold in BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-05 12:04:34
Nope, they get the reward simply so money is distributed and as an incentive to mine in the first place. Just because 25 BTC/block right now is a lot of USD equivalent does not mean that this will always cover costs or has.

At current technology levels, yes. There's a good chance this could be improved significantly, but until it hurts the devs are usually quite reluctant to do anything.
Another example: It would be enough to download a few dozen MB of data to be able to run a fully validating mining node, you don't need the 18(?) GB block chain... still no real progress on that front ("ultrapruning") for a long time now.

I personally would only ensure that the transactions are assembled as intended (e.g. if you have additional data to communicateto someone with your transaction: Use OP_RETURN, not a pubkey field), then services building on top of Bitcoin also won't run into issues. This also levels the playing field, because "quick and dirty" implementations just wil have a much harder time than ones actually taking the time to understand Bitcoin internals and using transaction opcodes properly.

@_date: 2014-12-15 12:58:59
On one hand since ripple is not a Bitcoin clone the api cannot be copy-pasted which is why cryptsy for example took so long to even accept deposits.
Also Ripple does not depend on XRP as much as Bitcoin depending on BTC. 10 USD worth of them can transfer far more money than 10 USD worth of BTC (which can only transfer about 10 USD in value). This comes at the cost of trust though, something only popular in some cases around here.

@_date: 2014-04-06 16:52:59
The most believable explanation I heard when this came up last time was that the miner ensures that the merkle tree is as full as possible, to not waste space for empty leaves but also not to include too many transactions which increase propagation time.
If she includes 129 transactions for example, she has 127 empty leaves in the merkle tree that waste space. It might be smarter to include 127 fee paying transactions, since the space and bandwidth would be wasted elsewise.
The reason why this is not adopted more broadly is that most miners seem to not be very good with programming or learnign about Bitcoin itself and seem more concerned about playing with hardware.

Won't work without true irreversible payments, waiting until traditional payments are finalized takes far too long with current volatility (in the example: A buys 0.01 BTC for 1€ from B, then the price changes and they have to either step back and renegotiate or one of them has to agree to sell below maket or buy above market).
Also it is an incredibly slow and inefficient way to trade...
@_date: 2014-01-17 10:15:37

Oh, I see, thanks! Similar issues to the "input combination" problem (where after some time you might need to combine several inputs to make one payment) as once you forward your money you are forced to reveal after the fact that you received it, but still better than the current situation.

One single transaction on the bitcoin network does cost the network a 2-digit amount of USD. Most of that is not paid by fees but by inflation (YES, Bitcoin is inflating and will do so until ~2140) but this will have to be covered more and more by fees to keep the current level of security, since block rewards halve every ~4 years.
There is no open market for transaction fees (yet), miners seem to just follow the arbitrary central rules of bitcoin-qt.
Transactions take long to be finalized compared to centralized services and even to some decentralized ones.
There is very limited space in blocks and to go around this, you'd need either trusted off-chain services (centralized or decentralized) that bunch payments together and balance e.g. once a day or a hard fork of Bitcoin itself.

How does a 100% fair distribution work? Bitcoin tried to solve the distribution issue by PoW (basic premise: Anyone can buy computing power and it will be the same anywhere in the world) - this has issues with getting the word out though (I mined coins with my GPU - good luck with that nowadays).
There are other concepts (e.g. "anyone can buy coins with BTC" --&gt; NXT and MasterCoin, or "everybody with a valid government ID can get a certain amount" --&gt; Auroracoin), apparently RippleLabs decided to just screw this distribution stuff and either try out several ways to give XRP away or to simply sell them.
A bad investment is not a scam, there was never any lies or doubt about the allocation of XRP - compare this to an actual scam (e.g. pirateat40), where it was always completely unclear how he actually made the money.

As far as I get it, there will be always 2 transactions: one to the "stealth" address, notifying a payment (e.g. "I paid you something, the address is your stealth one + 1234567") and the other one to an actual classic 1BitcoinAddress.
While stealth address owners could in theory cycle through all possible addresses that can be generated from the stealth one, in practice as long as the random number the payer chose is random and long enough there is no sense in doing that.
This means you are 100% dependent on at least knowing about the "mapping" transaction (it doesn't have to be in a block but you need to know the random number) - right?

You're free to build such a service, however the use is rather limited, it is very easy to circumvent this (even just sending coins to a second address you own makes it already hard to be sure this is still the "thief" or just an unsuspecting web wallet service for example) and people are also free NOT to use this service/ignore it.
Also a big question is what will happen once you are thinking you received e.g. 1 BTC that was stolen from mywallet a few years back. Do you go to the police and tell them you maybe received stolen internet funny money that might belong to someone on a different continent?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:17:40
My personal theory is that their cold key storage is just overengineered (e.g. a M of N scheme with too many physical locations/people involved) and it really takes that much time (it has been ~1 month now?) to get them back. Maybe there is also extortion involved or someone who held some reserves has gone AWOL.
Saying now that all has been lost would be bad until they tried everything, saying that they don't know how much has been lost is what Mark already kinda sorta did, saying that they are confident to get back at least e.g. 80% of funds within 2 weeks might get them into legal trouble.
So far I have seen 0 proof that their ~700k BTC are either inaccessibly lost (private key unrecoverable), paid out to customers (they would have had MUCH higher prices there if you would get 700k free BTC over time there) or employees.
Also I cannot imagine the amount of stress and death threats (and potentially real problems - apparently they moved out of their old building after getting strange pieces of mail...) he must get. Admitting to mistakes won't calm the crowd down likely.

Well, you just need someone else to sign this stuff who owns a rich address... since it doesn't cost anything to do that, that's easy to do.
One thing that could be done is to calculate a new address based on ALL signatures of the day +  a secret number (of which they only publish the hash in advance). Then they transfer the coins to the next address, reveal the current signatures and it can be verified that the signatures took place. The next day after transferring funds they reveal the secret number of the LAST day, so the private key is known (but the address is already empty) and they have proof that the funds were transferred.
This would mean that there actually have to be some transfers going on, not ust (cheap) signatures.

XORing several entropy sources at least doesn't weaken the total entropy typically, hashing with SHA256 though is not proven to keep 256 bits of entropy. On the other hand Bitcoin heavily depends on SHA256 anyways, so any weakness there would mean you should shwitch crypto primitives in any case.

You seem to misunderstand how Bitcoin works.
Whatever miners mine is what Bitcoin is. SatoshiDice can easily send their transactions directly to miners and there's nobody stopping them except for a softfork (which again has to be supported by miners).
It is irrelevant whether I (since I don't mine any more) consider them as spam or not, once they get mined I HAVE to store their stuff until it is spent again, then I can prune it. I can however decide not to participate in forwarding transactions from spammers, from people in the USA, from anyone with an even IP, randomly drop transactions... some of these measures might not be very healthy for the network, there are worse effects out there though (such as firewalled nodes).

That would be a rather weird solution as you wouldn't need consensus at all - it's like everyone agreeing that 1 Bitcoin miner is enough and everyone just chooses not to compete with her.
As long as it is clear that consensus can not be reached in a certain configuration (e.g. a lot of your possible graphs are ones where nodes have empty UNLs) I don't really see a problem, since it is clear for sub-graph members that can reach consensus that they can and others who cannot each consensus that they cannot. The only dangerous situations are if you think you can (and did) reach global consensus, but actually only reached it locally. A Bitcoin analogy would be an "evil mining ISP attack" that controls your uplink to the internet and feeds you an alternative chain.
A more interesting potentially broken topology is  (it seems a bit fabricated of course and again is rather an edge case than the norm - in the vast majority of your possible graphs it is clear for all nodes that they can/can't reach consensus and their assumption is true globally too). There is also some mitigation suggested by JoelKatz below to deal with that, I don't think it is in Ripple yet.
It would be interesting to write an easier simulator though that just enumerates all potential graphs and checks if there are configurations where local nodes think they can reach global consensus but can only reach local one (e.g. 2 sets of 5 nodes each that are only connecting to each other, both believe they are global yet there are 2 "truths")

If you total that car after these 10 miles though, you still paid 10.01k $ per km(?).
If we go with the car analogy, your car costs you something based on time (depeciating because people pay less for old cars, taxes, parking...), something based on distance travelled (gas) and maybe something that is a combination of both (repairs are more likely needed if you drive a lot instead of leaving the car in the garage).
Over the lifetime of a car you can calculate how much a km will cost you if you buy a car for 30k $ that will drive 200k km over 10 years and uses 5 liters of gas per 100 km.
At any point of time you can calculate how much it did cost you so far for all the km you already travelled.   
Also you can calculate how much it did cost you per km since last week, in the last 365 days or whatever other time frame via a simple subtraction.

Problem is that what you described (trust-net netsplit) was likely not happening in this case... very likely SDF ran a network of only a few validators that trusted only each other. Probably they ran into timeouts (e.g. by taking too long to query their databases), saw no confirmation from their peers and decided "screw this, I'll advance the ledger anyways".

Anyways, already quite a lot of content for an 11 year old (I would have been far more lazy at that age and I'm not even sure if that has changed up until now... ;) ).
Since this is the "critics" corner, here is still a bit by me:
* You can NOT "send and receive" BTC with your public wallet address, you can only receive.   
* The increase in BTCUSD is a coincidence. ;-)
* The finite number of BTC itself does not mean they get more and more expensive - it just means that the total supply is known and limited right from the start. One other important part in finding prices is the demand side, meaning how many people want to own a part of these 21 million units to do with them what they want.
I sent her a little bit (well, for her it might be a larger bit, considering she is "mining" in Satoshi amounts :D -  to her wallet address. Btw. I do NOT hope she does go into computer science, I hope she finds something that she truly love to do (and if that really is CS, it's fine by me too of course) and that this money can help her with that somehow in the future by paying for some things needed for that.
Edit:   
One last remark - if you produce something great (a paper, a picture, a gadget...) don't forget to sign it! I know that it might not be the best idea to show the name of your 11 year old daughter on the web, but tell her that she should also list herself clearly as author of all of this. It is not always clear for anyone in the world (I live nearly half-way around the globe for example...) who is meant with "I". She already did list "Joe Matti" as expert and not just write "according to a guy I talked to" for example - she is now an expert too, so she should make sure that others can reach her.   
Again - this is maybe not something that should go on the net (or maybe it should? The internet was different when I was 11...) right away but is important to keep in mind.

In essence, once a ledger has been globally (or at least by a super majority) accepted as valid, it is considered "validated" and the validators start to apply new transactions to this one. This happens about every 10 seconds, after that a transaction is finalized/confirmed/validated and can not be undone any more.

Not just memory blowup, the attacker could also make you believe you are synced on the longest chain, while in reality you are stuck on a low-work chain that is simply an alternate reality... If a rather recent checkpoint is included, there is little an attacker can do (as there need to be several blocks mined at current difficulty, then at a lower difficulty, then at 1/4th of that lower difficulty 8 weeks later etc.). If Genesis is the only "checkpoint", then this becomes feasible, especially with ASICs widely available that could rewrite diff-1 history at amazing rates.

One part of that (the amount of funds that should be stored, which is the sum of all user balances) is already possible with Ripple. The other part requires you trusting auditors/banks statements for the fiat part, for cryptocurrencies, they can sign some text (e.g. newspaper headlines oder bitcoin header hashes, so they cannot pre-sign statements into the future) with private keys holding their funds as proof.

While traditional pools tell you a (hidden!) list of transactions you HAVE to mine, P2Pool only forces you to mine a single transaction (the payout ot other pool members), so you are free to choose whichever other transactions you want to include.

1. Yes
2. Yes, you simply iterate over them. Currently there are close to 108k accounts (aka. addresses) on Ripple
3. Remove no, add yes - the first transaction needs to be an XRP transaction of at least the Account reserve (currently 20 XRP, see 
An account can have multiple balances in different currencies, however only one XRP balance (e.g. you can only have 1000 XRP but 30 USD from Bitstamp, 20 USD from SnapSwap and 1 BTC from DividendRippler). The reason for that is that unlike every other balance, XRP have no issuer (they stand for themselves). Since you seem mostly concerned with XRP, the answer is that accounts can only have a single value that represents how many XRP they own.

That single checksum of the checksum of the checksum [...] of the data is called the "root" - it depends on all data AND on all intermediate checksums.
The idea is that you can leave out some data later (called "pruning") and just store the checksum of that data instead and the root checksum still stays the same.

Yes, if you can take down a handful of large pools at the same time and have high hash rate yourself, you'd be able to attack the remaining network.
You would however have a hard time to actually solve blocks sufficiently fast (if you have e.g. 1/6th of the total current hash rate, you'll solve a single block per hour - and keeping a few pools down for hours all at the same time will be hard to do)
You'd seriously stir up some people here, it's not very likely that you'd be able to actually accomplish much beyond that.
It would probably be cheaper to develop your own ASICs and attack the network with a more conventional 51% attack or (if you are able to attack pools) better attack the servers of pools to carry out your scheme rather than forcing them down.

"Set up a full node" just means running Bitcoin Core (former Bitcoin-Qt) and maybe checking that port 8333 really is being forwarded to your PC.
The problem with home connections is that they usually have shitty upload speeds and until the P2P code of Bitcoind has been finally reworked (aka. "header first sync"), it will only download the blocks from one single node. If this is you, they would likely have been better off loading it from a node with more upload bandwidth.

You miss my point: It is "**Ripple is not XRP**", not "*XRP is not a coin*".
Also I feel a bit weirded out about the "We" rhethorics, especially since I am a Bitcoin user for over 3 years now...   
anyways, you also can "just join" Ripple too and like you have to invest money to get a few (fractions of a) BTC, you need the same for Ripple. While it might not make sense imho to buy 10k USD worth of XRP, buying 1 USD worth of them is really easy and after that you can actually use Ripple fully (while in BTC if you mine 1 USD worth of electricity, you might not even get a payout from your pool or end up with unspendable dust - not to mention that you can only really mine if you buy a few 100 USD worth of ASIC equipment or mine altcoins on your GPU and exchange them for BTC). Historically mining BTC nearly always was the worse option in comparison to buy&amp;hold by the way.


Whoever sold the XRP on the open, free market inside Ripple or as a broker - this is very likely NOT Ripple Labs by the way. They are currently "hodling" harder than some hardcore-bulls in Bitcoinland and not really making markets with their stash. There is no way for them to decide who can take part or not, if I send some of my XRP to Snowden, Wikileaks or Kim Yong Un, so be it. All they need is a private/public key pair they can generate on their own, just like in Bitcoin.

 - 2/3 of global hash rate comes from 3 pools. If they jump on a different hard fork, you better move with them.
Do you really think that reducing network security to a third would have no impact or that every altcoin miner would love to see Bitcoin and not their whatevercopypastescamcoin thrive?
Global hash rate is about 12 million GH/s. Reducing this to 4 million GH/s by a sudden hard fork (and community dissent implied because of this) will make the smaller part very vulnerable. I'm not so sure if you do understand "the network" (whatever you mean by that) so well, but feel free to live in a bubble and believe/trust in the 2 benevolent pool operators that hold &gt;51% of the network right now.

Ripple does not mainly exist to shift around XRP (this is what makes it different from Bitcoin by the way, which mainly exists to shift around balances of BTC), it is not designed to be a "coin" but a payment network.
You cannot use Bitcoin without owning BTC either (and they are never free, even self-mined ones cost time and money), so I don't see the huge issue - getting enough XRP to transfer 1 million USD costs me less than 1 USD. Getting enough BTC to transfer 1 million USD costs me 1 million USD (plus fees, currency exchange risk, slippage etc.).
Honestly, XRP suck as "altcoin" if you think of "investing" in them. That does not mean Ripple sucks at all, just like BitPay does not need to care if BTC crashes or soars.

While there might be complicated ways to do this kinda-sorta, I'd just recommend to charge people paying with BTC up front and define already at payment time if they receive eventual refunds in the BTC amount they paid or if they get it in USD converted to BTC at then current rates (most likely the latter).
Everything else involves a mutually trusted third party - just take a look around here how that can work out (MtGox is the most recent larger example I guess). Your product would need to be _very_ popular (think Oculus Rift popular) to convince me to pay anything in advance to Coinbase for example.

This also leads to a lower payment to yourself. Imagine 5% of a pool's users using this client, so everyone gets only 95% of the theoretical value (since 5% less blocks are found).
The more people try to hurt a pool with this, the more they end up hurting themselves - if they mined honestly they would earn 5% more. In the end this will just lead to a new equilibrium of lazy miners (who don't realize there are freeloaders) and "activists" cutting their own profits.
Block withholding (just like prop-pool hopping) is very easy to do/implement. It is not too hard to pull off but the impact is very limited, hurts the attacker more than the pool and also hurts the operator MUCH less than other miners and the attacker itself.

It's a tragedy of the commons scenario - were you mining when pool hopping was around?! You could earn ~10-20% more BTC with he same hash rate.
This too offers miners strictly more money for the same hash rate. If you're into getting more BTC, you wouldn't care about the USD value of them, also even if you do NOT mine there, others still are, they earn more than you that way and no matter the USD price, they also earn more USD than you.

This is very similar to how Ripple's ledger works. It is doable for sure (there is some code out there that does this for Bitcoin too), however for this approach to be useful and trustless, you'd need a softforking change (discard elsewise valid blocks if they do contain a wrong hash for the UTXO data at that height).

The averade trade size even on leveraged platforms like bitfinex is FAR below 140 BTC. While there are "big fish" out there, being able to dump 100+ BTC via market orders and not move the market is not something that I am personally particularly concerned about. If you are, use something else ("OMG, I wanted to buy just a few million USD worth of BTC, now I've moved the price to 700+ USD! WTF?!") or become a market maker on Kraken.
Size is not everything, see MtGox, BTC-e et. al.

It is possible to try all possible inputs and thus reconstruct candidates for the original input.

Most likely exchanges did not anticipate the larger volume of withdrawals and are now following their procedures to top off their hot wallets as we speak.
Being able to click on "withdraw" and see a transaction in your client a few seconds later has some serious security implications down the road and is not something you should expect actually.
Edit:   
People messing with transaction signatures for "fun" on the network right now are not helping there either - yes, while it is easy to bash MtGox to actually assume the ID that is returned when sending a transaction is actually the ID that will show up on the block chain, it seems a lot of people were at least storing TXIDs to show to users as proof that a transaction took place. This is now no longer sufficient, so even if there are no issues with wallets, there is probably still need to adapt in the background. Bitcoind also can get confused if it tries to spend an unconfirmed incoming transaction that turns out to be not confirmed at all... so yeah, there will be probably a bit of patching and integration testing going on tonight all over Bitcoinland. Anyways, stay safe, make backups, go to a pub and wait for all of this to blow over.

You seem to confuse "VPN" with "internet proxy". If you want to access the internet from a different endpoint than the one your local provider provides, you need a proxy (which is often accessed via a VPN software because it might be easier to set that up or to authenticate yourself against it).
Tinc is not designed to be a huge global network of unknown peers, it is designed to directly connect peers that already know each other via a secure tunnel over the internet without requiring them to set up a VPN server just to exchange $secret_file, have a private chat or maybe just to connect to your printer at home while on some dubious open WLAN.
I don't get your section about con games at all, so I'll just guess it comes from not understanding which problems VPNs and especially P2P VPNs usually solve. Hint: It's definitely not anonymity or trustlessness.

If you use BitPay, you are NOT accepting Bitcoins, you are accepting USD or BTC (or a mixture of both) from BitPay that they hopefully pay to you.
This is like stating that you accept USD because you have a PayPal button - you do not accept actual USD, only something that PayPal might or might not forward to you that they received from their customers in whatever form or shape.

Satoshi left the community before even the first altcoin showed up and even then it took 3-4 forks until someone finally had the idea of premining currency (actually initially this was done by putting a bunch of coins in genesis, not mining for days in secret).

I guess you mean "Ripple", as "ripples" (or XRP) are just the native asset there, similar to what BTC is to colored coins.
The main difference in my opinion is that CC do require (small amouts of) BTC to be attached to, Ripple IOUs don't. Also Ripple is a different network specialized in providing a decentralized order book/market while CC are bolted on BTC technology (has both advantages and disadvantages, especially when spending coins).
In how they work, CC are very similar to Ripple IOUs, they need a trusted issuer, they are not the asset but just represent it and need to be redeemed etc.

Cipher cascades are not always more secure than the single ciphers... and if one cipher in a cascade breaks, it still needs to be replaced.
Addresses are already cascaded (ripemd160 + sha256 of the pubkey) and addresses are cheap enough (one transaction fee) that you can stop worrying about leaking ECDSA pubkeys and just move your funds to a virgin address once in a while.

To be fair, there are probably few services out there with the amount of addresses MtGox has under control.
There were already issues years ago with people mining directly to their deposit addresses ("I mined a few hundred BTC and wanted to trade them - where are my 50 USD?!").
I don't want to speculate what they didn't do or not, it's just that a lot of people still seem to assume that if you create and sign a transaction, get its TXID and store that, you can later jsut query bitcoind for that TXID and find out if it actually took place or not. This is NOT true and I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't already did quite a few services who are just unaware of this and now unknowingly run fractional reserve.

Have been for ~4 years now and counting.
Anyways, since in your example the dealer is the central authority - he could easily (and is in practice in nearly any casino game if played online) be replaced by an algorithm/robot and the game still works exactly the same. The algorithm is known (e.g. for Blackjack it is written on the table) and there are no disputes in the end, only rules that are followed or not - if not either your friends or the casino kicks you out, Bitcoin just ignores your block.
The thing is, that to find out who is cheating there are already fixed rules that are the same, no matter who (a group, a person, an algorithm) enforces them.
Part of the rules in Bitcoin is that there is only one single valid chain (the one containing the most work done) that everybody has to obey. It controls "the game", contains all moves that happened so far (and thus you can calculate the current state) and disputes are resolved by adding to it. The difference to poker is that there are a handful of pools trying to add at the same time to the chain, not a single dealer. Still there is always only one single pool/person per block, not a consensus or majority in any way. Bitcoin allows you to be a dictator one block at a time (the faster you hash, the more often this happens).

Well, not much to add I think... ledger is currency agnostic, can handle large amounts of digits after a decimal separator (the default 1/100th split of a lot of software solutions can be a bit problematic if you do accounting in full Bitcoins, not in µBTC) and the documentation is really good too.
It lacks a bit in the "fancy graphs + curves" area, getting an overview can be a bit hard if you just have to stare at numbers. Still very often these are all you're looking for after all.   
Another area for improvements are importers for various export formats, especially custom ones. Converting all the history of your Bitcoin exchange, Paypal or bank account into ledger after some trial and error can be quite satisfactory. :) A community project that writes converters for specific Bitcoin based sites might help a lot there.

Bitcoin is centralized around the block chain (that represents central global consensus) too.

The set of validators is up to you, it is not random (as you said, in that case it would be easy to doa sybil attack by bringing online e.g. 10k validators you secretly control). You can of course choose to just trust a random subset of all validators too to not collude if you like.
Validators don't need to be "good", they just need to value their reputation higher than a request to defraud someone visibly. The reward would need to be very high, considering a fraudster needs to convice &gt; 80% of the global "influence" to follow her/him and a single leak before the fact would be enough to reveal the cartel.

Do you turn off ads, as soon as 500 (or 1000? How much are you "allowed" to make off your page?) USD income is reached in a given month? Are you even allowed to turn off ads at will (this would piss off advertisers probably causing them to pay you less)?
Also: If 1 click on an ad is worth 1 USD and 1% of people clicks ads - are people REALLY willing to pay 1 cent for EVERY website they visit every month? Would people then start to limit their browsing to meta-websites (e.g. wikipedia, which collects information) to stay within budget, centralizing information further?

Bitcoin is based on having lots of tiny dictators that constantly try to push their version of the truth onto everybody else. The only thing that stops them from not accepting others' truths in the mean time is that this would mean they have to 51% the network to be able to push their truth back onto the others and that's too costly.

This is what I said with:


Your argument that nodes could check all chains available to them is flawed in the sense that there is only one globally valid chain AND that this chain might not be available to a node at all, ever. In that case it is useful to detect this as soon as possible - in the current implementation when hitting a checkpoint and realizing the block hash is different.


Checkpoints contain the header hash of certain blocks - that's the reality of the whole network.

This "strategy" makes little sense, as on Just-Dice you can adapt your chances (and output) away from 50:50. You can for example bet to have 98% probability to win 1% extra, if you are very risk averse.
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:33:17
No, you're wrong.


This makes no sense - once coinbase has more than 25 BTC generated any honest node will not forward this block, accept no block built upon it and not consider anything as transacted until there is another valid block showing up instead of the fake one. There wouldn't be a fork since there is no valid branch to use. It might be possible that someone continues mining on such a wrong block, that would just mean though that the 51% attack is over. No node operated by anyone but the attackers would even consider any block from that "illegal" branch, no matter the hash rate there.
You could seperate a node form the network so it sees no more valid blocks, but you will never be able to convince it to accept something that is against the current rules.

Not much more to say about them - they are a special transaction that can contain the amount of fees paid the the transactions in the block + a predetermined maximum amount of "new" bitcoins. Miners are free to choose the recipient and amount (up to the maximum), most choose of course the maximum amount and their own (or their pool's) address.
If you are mining in a pool, you typically don't get to choose this transaction by the way.

I can understand that they want to be reimbursed for the BitPay fees - BUT if they charge the same amount as for CC/PP I'll just use these because the premium there goes towards buyer's protection and actual service advantages for me as buyer.

A "block chain" (actually a chain of hashes that contain the predecessor as part of the input of the next hash) is not a concept exclusive to Bitcoin or even a new invention.

Well, theoretically they could create verified lists of addresses that belong to VAT exempt entities and only mine their transactions...
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:58:15
This is similar to a soft fork in Bitcoin (where miners could decide transactions that use your unspent output X are invalid and decide not to build upon blocks that contain it, making the coins unspendable).
You can check ledgers for inconsistencies and since validators need to sign their version of the truth, you also have hard proof that there is either a bug or worse - someone is out to censor you. This either would lead to a fork (one side: people supporting the change, other side: the ones opposing it) or it anyways is globally accepted for whatever reason (see the BTC soft fork scenario).
I agree with the shitty situation of RippleLabs still having far too much control over validations, this is both easy and hard to fix... currently I still hope that rippled becomes more easy to deploy and run before decentralisation is on their main agenda - compared to a full node in Ripple, bitcoind is tiny (e.g. you need about 0.5-1 TB for databases at the moment for full history compared to Bitcoin's 25(?) GB)
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:47:17


No, they would only take 10% of anything above 10 BTC.
E.g. you invest 10 BTC, some whale screws up and at the end of the week you have 11 BTC --&gt; They take 10% of the 1 BTC of your profit (0.1 BTC) and now will take 10% of anything above 10.9 BTC in the future. If the whale comes back and wins now big time and your investment is 10.1 BTC at the end of the next week, you don't pay anything, even though you originally only invested 10 BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:58:14
Bitcoin is not that suitable for micro-payments anyways (depends on your volume and amount planned).
You could describe way for the company to securely store their keys while still making sure they are available for audits (and how to conduct these) as well as replenishing hot wallets manually or even automatically.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:47:10
I already told you numerous times that this is easy to proof:
There are ~100 billion XRP in ledger 32570.  
Every transaction costs at least 0.00001 XRP, which are destroyed in the process.  
XRP can not be created, only transferred using transactions (which do incur fees).
This is proof enough in any algorithm analysis to proof that there will never be more XRP than at the point when you launch this system and that at any checkpoint this counter is the highest amount of XRP possible for the future. I cannot "proof" that a transaction to create new XRP does not exist, since it does not exist - I can only link to documentation or code describing all valid transaction types and you can see for yourself that it is not possible to create new XRP with these.
Edit:  
This sum is even part of each ledger hash, so if there is any mistake in it, the headers would be invalid. Bitcoin can't do that, because it is not always clear how many BTC exist or who owns them.
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:16:29
Yes, that's also the reason why there can never be 21 million BTC.
Coinbase transactions are "up to" a certain amount (fees + "out of thin air" part), I am not 100% sure they are also optional.
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:43:13
Well, 12 million is about half of 21 million, however to fulfill number 4 there need to be *new* buyers for all the remaining millions of coins...
Under these assumptions (you assume static value) of course it's not possible to devalue. I don't believe in these assumptions though.

Even then... buying up debt or speculating on it is hardly a new or unique concept.
Also MtGox is not bankrupt, since their books are not open it is hard to know/estimate if they secretly already are insolvent or not.

@_date: 2014-01-10 10:22:01
Thanks for clarification!
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:37:08
Nope, not possible, since transactions need to be signed by private keys that you do likely not possess.
If you talk about double spends, then yes, you need to resolve this via Consensus - which relies more on people NOT trusting each other actually... still involving trust does not equal "not decentralized", as you can add anyone to be a validator. Consensus works similar to PoS, only that every node can choose the distribution of stake holders individually (otherwise it wouldn't make sense, since IOUs are arbitrary and XRP are centrally issued at the beginning).
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:01:56
Manually: Borrow BTC, sell them, buy at the bottom, repay loan + interest, keep rest as profit.
All the above automated: Bitfinex. You can use my refcode x5K9YtL3Zb if you want to - posting it because it gives you -10% on fees. If you want to use a different one, just search on Google for them and if you want to use none - fine by me.

@_date: 2014-03-19 09:35:03
Because double spends wouldn't work either - they just would be "alternative spends".
Consider a 51% attack after block 100 (the current chain has progressed to block 110):
Block 101 contains a 100 BTC payment to Alice
Mallory mines _alternative_ blocks 101\*, 102\*, 103\* etc. that do not contain this payment but instead these 100 BTC go to Bob in block 101\*.
Once Mallory's chain catches up with the network's chain (which it has to eventually, since she owns 51% of hash rates), she reveals it. All clients check her chain, there are only valid transactions in there and it is longer so they switch. Alice suddenly sees that the 100 BTC she thought to already own were actually not sent at all in the new "reality". Bob owns them now.
This is not a double spend inside the longest chain (this is not possible) but something that results from the central consensus that bitcoin requires and which can be changed after the fact.

As long as you're not very well connected to a large majority of miners, these instructions (while probably ok) are not very good.
It's enough if a handful of nodes (the biggest mining pools) see a transaction first to nearly ensure that a double spend will succeed.
Especially when sending out by mail you can just wait the ~1 hour and be done with it, it's not like the postal service immediately forwards packages anyways.
Also you are basing your assumptions only on the default unconfirmed transaction selection policies of Bitcoin-core. This is not a very good base to give recommendations.

What about malled transactions? It might be quick to complete one trade, however to "flip" it back, you might need to include the colored coin in the block chain to be able to spend it again (or you risk someone changing the first trading transaction later so the hash referenced in the second trade is invalid) as far as I get it.

The paper: 
Seems like they ran a penny grabber ("We find that the total profit peaked at 3362 yuan with a **2872 trades** in total with average investment of 3781 yuan.") and also just simulated their trading  with different thresholds. Their best threshold (which they only found AFTER finishing training and simulating trades) was the one that netted them about 89% return.
Their strategy was to trade once their regression testing showed that the price would probably move about 0.65 (it's a bit hard to see from the chart) - if up, buy 1 BTC, if down, sell 1 BTC.
I'm not sure why they did only these relatively simple approaches, on the other hand it is easily possible to "overtrain" something so your model fits the past too well and gets too rigid.

Ripple != XRP/"ripples". They are the least interesting part of that system, something that seems very hard to swallow for people being heavily invested and interested in stuff like BTC.

These are fundamental issues, you need to have basics in place.
While there might be use cases for applications where it does not matter if someone can access data or program logic (check out some projects utilizing BOINC), very often it also matters that only you have access to both data and maybe also program logic if you run a CPU intensive task.

No, since with current code unsynced nodes will only ever bootstrap from a single other node - if that node is me, then a single other node will likely max my upstream.

Bitcoins are typically spendable with a HASH160 output, meaning you have "only" a 2^160 search space
Typically you don't need to do an exhaustive search to break cryptosystems, most of them are broken through side channels and/or bad implementations (there have been a lot of BTC stolen already because of the stuff on the right side of the picture)
Also this assumes that RIPEMD160(SHA256(ECDSA privkey)) is holding up for all eternity. A pretty strong assumption, there is NO mathematical proof out there for any part of this construction that guarantees the implied strength, there is just nobody that has not ~~found~~ published something to disproof it either.

All transactions that you think that could be legally applied to the current ledger, put into a hashed tree structure according to the "Transactions" wiki page.

If you connect P2Pool to your own bitcoind, the ONLY transaction that you cannot choose is coinbase, the one that distributes the mining rewards to the other miners in the pool. Every other transaction can be included just as you like it or see fit, that's why the 51% attack is not useful for P2Pool after all.

Hard to do, since Bitcoin solves this problem by just NOT distributing transactions over several machines but requires everybody to download all transactions to be able to verify in a 0 trust scenario.

This only removes the hash rate that you pay for from other pools. An example: Your offer gets used by 10TH/s of miners in a 100 TH/s pool. This pool still reports the valid blocks that are found by 90TH/s of its miners.
It is a way to increase payouts for these 10% of miners for sure, it will NOT increase your own payouts though, you'll likely loose money with that approach. However, the competing pool will also pay out significantly less (10% less) to the 90% of honest miners, who then (if they are rational) would switch to your scheme too.
In the end it is just a matter of who dies first - you by running out of funds or the competing pool(s) by not being able to solve any block in a reasonable amount of time and thus being uninteresting for honest miners.
It might work to remove a small percentage of a mining pool's hash rate and make it look like the operator is cheating (in fact, a very similar "attack" could be run by pool operators), it likely won't increase your own revenue though.

Ripple is a payment network/decentralized exchange, not a currency. The currency/native asset on Ripple is called "ripples" or XRP.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:44:38
I'm not too sure if people understand what decentralized exchange means...
While there is a chance (and several working open source implementations) to have a decentralized order book, there will ALWAYS be the need to hand your assets to some trusted third party who then gives you some kind of token you can use to trade on the exchange. No matter if you call this entity "escrow agent", "gateway", "bank" or "DAC" there is no way that USD can be transacted digitally, since they are printed on paper and that paper needs to be stored somewhere.
So yes, have fun with decentralized exchanges and there are great things out there already and in the making. Do NOT expect someone to come up with a "trustless" scheme to transact USD though - after all, that's the main reason BTC was created in the first place!

Not "networking" but more "network" related, but creating a graph and analyzing this out of all Bitcoin transactions so far might have some interesting results for you. :)
A more advanced thing (again, not "networking" related any more) would be to look at ticker data from exchanges and blockchain transactions and see if you can correlate something there (e.g. large deposits to exchanges of old coins before a sell-off). There seem to be huge spikes in coin days destroyed before large price movements for example.
If it really has to be more low level stuff, try to analyze/collect some stats and run simulations about Bitcoin's P2P network - how long does it REALLY take to relay a block, how much is a block delayed if it is including more transactions, how large could blocks actually become with current hardware...

Validators can be anonymous too, if you want them to be. You run into similar problems as TOR then though (if all TOR nodes are anonymous, it is hard to know if there are not a lot of them secretly colluding against you).
In practice it will likely be a mixture between known validators (I don't see anything illegal there with operating one, also "the government" is not a global organization), anonymous ones and maybe some random new ones added for good measure. To defraud you, one needs &gt; 80% of all validators you trust and even then you can provide cryptographic proof afterwards that these 80% nodes are dishonest.

Just delete the stored blocks in bitcoind, it still works... it will just not serve them to other nodes any more (for obvious reasons).
It is not a new way of "node", it's more of a space efficiency thing.
Hopefully with 0.10 we'll finally get header first sync and the associated peer messages for single blocks/headers, I personally was hoping that this already is in 0.9 but apparently the payment API was pushed more.
I turned off my full node (well, I still run it, but non reachable by the public any more) since at the moment all it does is clogging your upstream, wasting your ressources with 0 returns and my slow upload speed also means that I waste the time of others too, who happen to download blocks only from me and not in parallel from all peers as it should be done. Putting lots of full nodes online on slow home connections (and administered by people who don't know what they are doing, probably not forwarding ports and just consuming ressources) might actually be worse, since Bitcoin-Core is not one of the smartest P2P applications out there when it comes to distributing data.

Slower propagation of blocks, since every node first checks them for validity before sending them further. This takes longer the more transactions are included, also it takes more time to actually send the transactions.
The slower blocks propagate, the higher your orphan rate will be and orphaned blocks are a lot of lost money at once.

Bitcoin currently can not scale 100x any more, see 
(Edit:  - Bitcoin can maybe scale 10 times bigger, most likely less, since spikes would lead to real issues then...)
There is a fixed upper limit to the amount of transactions in a block (actually their size). The upper limit to transactions in a block is 1 MB or ~6000 minimal sized transactions or half of that amount for larger transactions. In reality it will be somewhere in the middle between that, so about 4-5k transactions per block ever unless there is a very broad global consensus on a larger block size and people decide to go through with a hard fork.
This also means that even with the maximum amount of tiny transactions every transaction still will cost 4.15 mBTC extra due to inflation. This is the minimum of your variable costs. You can not put 1 million transactions in a block, Bitcoin does not scale like that currently.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:30:12
No, for a &gt; 1MB block you need consensus of EVERY node in the system, not just miners. Anyone who does run any current version of Bitcoin will not accept such a block, no matter who mined it.

It's as easy to profit from ups as it is from downs for traders, look up what "shorting" means.

If I were the [insert your favourite agency] and wanted to build a honeypot to get as much info about which IP is interested in which address/transaction, who owns which address (by submitting a signed transaction directly to me for broadcasting or using my API) and much more, I'd either build or at least infiltrate/closely monitor blockchain.info.
We don't even have to worry about mining pools, the metadata that is created at blockchain.info just by people looking at their balances and using their centralized API is imho much worse than centralized pools.

Currently Bitcoin loads blocks from one(!) single node it connected to. In the future it will load block headers (maybe just from one or form several nodes, they are tiny though) and then request block contents for different blocks from different peers.
Kinda like downloading from one single (potentially slow/overloaded) server vs. downloading different smaller parts from all servers you can reach at the same time.

Genesis does NOT mean ledger 0, it means this is your starting balance sheet. As I said, Ripple is NOT Bitcoin, it contains (and validates) balance sheets, not just transactions that you have to process yourself.
If you can for example only access your bank statements 2 years back - but you know that at that time you started with 1337 USD on your account, you can validate your balance at every point in time since then.
Also there is no going back: if you discover you had 1 million USD 4 years ago on your bank account, this information does not change the fact that it was 1337 USD 2 years ago and also won't change any of the balances since then.

Since blocks are capped at 1 MB at the moment (and will stay that way until a hard fork is done), storage is not an issue in the first place.

The page +  the "social experiment" (issuing stuff with no intention of honoring them is fraud imho by the way) were conducted by TradeFortress, creator of inputs.io and poor victim of a "hack" where 4100 real BTC people deposited for his private Ripple competitor vanished. He likely spewed all that hate against Ripple to push his own webwallet service. Bitcoin is not "broken" because his site was broken, he simply betrayed people who trusted him blindly (inputs.io even had a nice disclaimer that said basically that there are no guarantees whatsoever). Also people who had Bitcoins deposited at BitStamp at that time were unaffected...
Him ( not honoring these BTC he issued on Ripple does have 0 influence on anyone who did/does not trust him there. If you don't understand how Ripple works, that's one thing. Calling it broken is a different matter.
Ripple is as risky as the counter parties you choose to interact with - if you choose to trust TradeFortress just because he tells you to, well, that's your choice. Also you are using the term "debt" wrong by the way, a more correct term for balances on Ripple would be IOU or even promissory note. That depends on your gateway's policies of course.

"OMG, someone (who even IS a core developer) enabled a controversial patch that is not sanctioned by all core developers! THIS IS AGAINST EVERYTHING BITCOIN STANDS FOR!"
As far as I understand that patch, it can even be turned off, contains other useful features (where the default branch is more against Bitcoin's spirit in my opinion, such as blocking nonstandard TX) like better transaction selection code for miners and of course idiotic stuff like tonal units...
I'd rather see another patch on top, that just disables blacklisting by default than have blacklisting go away - it is up to every node operator to decide what transactions to forward and up to every miner to decide which transactions to mine. The more tools you get to do these decisions, the better.

Well, to be fair, since it is not (yet?) possible to choose what to relay unless you recompile bitcoin-core after editing what is considered "nonstandard", the only expected behaviour regarding relay adaptability of bitcoin-core is the setting where you can decide for yourself how many satoshis "dust" means afaik.
I agree that nobody should expect bitcoin-core to run with only standard settings, so relaying every transaction is definitely not expected behaviour (if you want to limit your traffic significantly while still serving the network with blocks, just set your dust limit to e.g. 0.01 BTC for example), this patch (there are others also included) rather extends functionality than breaks it.

Well, then explain the hardfork in early 2013 where miners/pools were forced to make a very fast choice and chose the chain that at that time was behind AND that was running on an older bitcoind.
A legitimate transaction flood that threatens network operations as described in the OP could force the hands of miners in a similar way (unlikely but possible).
Also, miners on pools would use P2Pool if they would really care about the network, not closed source, centralized behemoths such as the existing ones. When pools like Deepbit got over 50% in earlier times also miners didn't seem to care too much about that either, I don't see how they should have wisened up since then.

The question is not about "backhole" servers which accept data and never really store it - it's about "ransom" servers that collude to gather as many 3-redundancy sets as possible and then charge extra for retrieval.

First of all, you can only generate receiving addresses, not sending addresses.
Secondly even in the original paper Satoshi outlines that anonymity is very hard to achieve - even if you do a lot correctly, a small error anywhere along the way can mean you're out in the open forever.

So far I don't know of ANY wallet implementation that ensures that even all known measures for anonymity are followed.

That's the nice thing about it - you can do your research WITHOUT postulating your assumptions (e.g. "I assume that currencies have significantly lower volatility than trading goods").
You do the data gathering, apply your metrics, look at the graphs and THEN say "of all 10 currency pairs analyzed, 8 have less than 3% volatility in 30 days, and the remaining 2 still less than 5%, while the 10 different commodities all were above 8% volatility. Bitcoin has a volatility of 12% on average in the observed time frame, so at the moment, I would classify it in the latter category. It seems to go down lately though, so in the future, it might be worth a second look to see if it goes down to more currency-like behaviour" (numbers randomly made up)

Bitcoin starts from 0 BTC, Ripple starts from 100 billion XRP in one account at ledger 0 (if you start a new network) or 99,999,999,999.996320 XRP in a few dozen accounts at ledger 32570 (if you look at the current network).


No, this is wrong and just an assuption that you insist on making. You said so yourself earlier in the bank account example (where something has happened before):


Here we have a ~100 billion balance 2.5 years ago that is verifiable (cryptographically, so in the end mathematically) and everything since then is also available and verifiable the same way. **Whatever happened before can not change the amount that exists afterwards**, so I don't get why you insist that anything needs to be checked there. Ledger 0 by the way does not contain some magic transaction that creates XRP out of coinbase, it simply states that account rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh ( has a balance of 100 billion XRP.


It is trivial to serialize headers + transactions and verify their hashes, you can (with a little bit more work) also serialize all entries in an AccountState tree to get to the AccountRoot hash that verifies all balances at any point of time. If you seriously want to do that, I recommend to take a deeper look at either rippled or donch's Go implementation of the Ripple protocol. This stuff is likely easier to do in Ripple by the way, since Bitcoin has a few more weird edge cases in its transaction scripting language while Ripple has a much stricter feature set - I wouldn't call it "easy" at all to write software that verifies Bitcoin balances correctly... blockchain.info for example does not and they are a rather large site.
The documentation needed for such stuff is available in C++ code in rippled and concepts are also described relatively well in the Ripple Wiki pages. If you are serious with that effort for writing software to verify rippled's calculated balances, also feel free to ask for help on IRC or in the forums once you have more concrete questions.

The pool owner however receives e.g. 2% of all income and I guess this is not very dependent on total hash rate. They typically don't care about their users at all - there are STILL proportional paying pools out there for example!

Just as long as there is no statement signed by him, he probably hasn't been found, as long as these funds are sent to an unrecoverable address (like "1BitcoinEater..."), they are probably under his control. There is no indication at all to assume otherwise.

Bitcoin is like cash, not like Visa.
If you want somebody else to limit you (to protect you from yourself or others, e.g. you need to go to the counter to withdraw more than 400 EUR from the bank) you're free to find a service that lets you deposit BTC with them and that manages your wallet for you. Coinbase, greenaddress.it or some exchanges might not process larger withdrawals without a waiting period for example.  
Multi-Sig is relatively easy, it often is rather an UI issue than anything else.
The thing is that Bitcoin tries to be non-trust as much as possible and you need to trust services that hold money for you. While it is possible to build such services on top of Bitcoin (lots of transactions and nearly all trades take place outside of Bitcoin in an environment that requires trusting a third party), initially Bitcoin attracted a lot of people who do NOT like this. If you think that the "Visa of Bitcoin" is needed, feel free to build a service like that.

Of course "they" own them, however to transfer e.g. 10k USD, you need 10k USD worth of BTC in Bitcoin - but you need far less than 1 cent worth of XRP in Ripple. While in Bitcoinland you are forced to use the native asset (BTC) for value transfer, Ripple only pays fees from XRP, not the actual amount transfered.

Any miner can still run a full node (it doesn't take much more effort than setting up the connection to a pool) and if the miner is too small, connect to p2pool.
Apparently a lot of them rather choose to let pools handle transaction selection for them (which is far more against the "spirit of Bitcoin" in my opinion), which is their own choice though - they are not forced by anything other than their lazyness/incompetence/negligence. Also pools might provide good services for them, so if you don't care about transactions, only rewards, letting a thrid party handle this for you might be a smart move.

That's because USD balances held at different places (e.g. USD deposited to SnapSwap and USD deposited to Bitstamp) are not the same inside Ripple, so there can be a market between USD.A and USD.B - similar to the price difference of BTCUSD at MtGox and Bitstamp.
The internal markets deend on utility most likely and people's sentiment of the gateway(s). You can put up your own trade order though and hope that it gets taken sooner or later instead of sending money (which is kinda like a market order) immediately, then again this might take longer or not succeed, just like trying to buy BTC for 100 USD a piece atm.

I know, I would still like to see 1 XBT = 100 Satoshi though.
While these sites might be in themselves be more popular, I guess the amount of people that actually view pages that have "XBT" anywhere written on them is smaller than some Bitcoin centric sites. Otherwise it's an argument like me saying "I use BTC on facebook, that page alone is orders of magnitudes larger than xe.com or oanda.com combined".
Having only 2 decimals for XBT is probably better than forcing 3 websites (kraken, xe, oanda) to multiply their existing values by 1 million.

At least in Bitcoin, for mining all you need is a trustworthy UTXO set. You don't need any blocks after you processed them, you don't need to serve anything to the network other than your new headers, the coinbase transaction and eventually other transactions unknown to the network.
What does "full node" mean in Ethereum context? Also switching on mining would mean you burn far more electricity than usual.

I work a lot with Ripple nowadays which forces exchanges out of the exchange business and moves them towards a e-money issuer/redeemer role with open book accounting for user accounts.
There are 2 numbers in every currency that need to match up: Amount of money held by the platform and sum of deposits of platform users. The latter can be cryptographically verified in a trustless way for anyone outside with Ripple, the former can be done for cryptocurrencies e.g. with known BIP32 style keys or for fiat via bank statements/audits (but that's not trustless then).
What are you doing except telling others to wait and see?

Well, there is no real way to know if you're storing your BTC at a "bank" (for the lack of a better term, coinbase is something like a bank where you store your funds) or actually keeping full control over them yourself.
Most people recommend to keep BTC with you (and take care yourself to keep the secret key to access them secret) instead of storing them at a third party like coinbase, where you have basically a BTC denominated bank account but do not have control over what happens with the BTC.

Set up a large (unfunded) buy order on the exchange of your choice, set up an automatic transfer there from you bank account and remember to withdraw your bought BTC to a secure location once a month.

You need to operate and maintain a full bitcoin node to select the set of transactions you want to include.
Imho there is no real miner friendly bitcoind out there, even large pools seem to simply use whatever the defaults are (Eligius being the exception rather than the norm) and there are only VERY few settings that are important to miners (e.g. soft blocksize limit). Also a lot of miners seem to be not too much into Bitcoin itself, they rather are after "generating money in your basement" - and with money they often mean USD.

Bitcoin has no concept of addresses in the protocol. Transactions don't even require signatures, depending on which inputs are spent. Also full history already is not required, the utxo set is enough. To build it in a trustless way, you need to process all blocks so far though.

They have a Paypal-like internal payment system, so these transactions are likely not SEPA at all but are just internal movements (an example would be sending BTC between accounts on MtGox which do not show up in the block chain as transactions and were just done on "paper").
I also wonder on whcih level they integrate(d) Ripple, if they act as gateway, this would be huge! It'll allow anyone to hold their normal EUR balance but pay in BTC anywhere BTC is accepted, kinda like "reverse BitPay". Also if Fidor would extend their services and e.g. offer a SEPA bridge, you would then also be able to hold BTC and pay anywhere where bank wires are accepted with BTC.

Then the fees are hidden elsewhere or the merchants pay a little more. In the end it's the same - CCs cost extra for the services they provide (chargebacks, customer protection). A Bitcoin service offering similar stuff would then also likely cost a few % extra.

you left out the "demands for" which date far back...

So far though there might be some little demad for it, it certainly does not deter people from using an exchange at all apparently. Heck, with BTC-e people don't even know who operates that and under which jurisdiction! More transparent or prudent platforms meanwhile get overlooked because they have too little volume or market depth (which seems to be more or less the only factor people actually care about - because it might happen over time that I might need to dump the 10k BTC that I got via trading... right?

Your guess is wrong, as I wrote a while back, Ripple in addition to a hashed header chain and transactions also hashes and verifies the complete balances of every account in the system.
You can throw away all ledgers until ledger  then that would be the new genesis ledger. Similar solutions (pruning/ultraprune/"ultimate blockchain compression") have been suggested for Bitcoin too, they would be at least soft forks though, so the work there seems to progress more slowly or it has stalled completely. See some stuff written by "maaku" for example, I guess he's still writing that BIP about his implementation.

That's why I made the distinction between XRP and actual balances. The main "person" than has money in XRP is Ripple Labs compared to gateway balances that represent actual user funds.
Unfortunately Bitcoin exchanges rarely give out data about how many user funds (especially in fiat!) they actually have so it is hard to compare.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:01:31

Ripple already kinda works that way, though it still would be necessary to publish the fiat side of transactions somehow (daily copy of bank statement?) if you want total transparency. The Bitcoin part could already be done with BIP32 pubkeys.

Nope, at least as long as Bitcoin-core is only able to get its blocks (especially the initial download) only from one SINGLE peer.
Also if you have poor upload bandwidth Bitcoin-core is likely to use up all of it (if you're not very good with QoS settings or have something like netlimiter locally installed) which in turn will make your whole connection slow.

Secretly destroying them would be of no real use to Bitcoin itself (and he knows that), since there is no way to know for sure - only the current situation. Loosing them is possible but not likely, since he seems to have been capable quite well to keep control over other keys he had (PGP key for mails, key for the global alert feature in Bitcoin itself...) and he might have said something that he has lost all of his backups of every wallet file he ever used.
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:53:22
Yes, but if you want to verify at least the unspent outputs of somebody _else_, you need a recent global UTXO snapshot. For creating a transaction your own UTXOs are enough.

Most MMOs I know of are not having a globally capped money supply but are capped just by the amount of money players "earn" over time. E.g. you're getting 1 gold piece per monster slain.
They then have "money sinks" to not run into huge inflation issues (e.g. every hit you do to or take from a monster takes off durability and costs you 0.01 gold pieces for repairs).
Bitcoin is not encrypted at all by the way, it uses cryptography but mostly for authenticating, not to hide the real meaning of something that can be shared publicly.   
Hash chains are just a design pattern, also used for example in git. Bitcoin could work without a block chain too, if there were some different design behind it.
The "why" reason for Bitcoin to be fixed supply is relatively well explained by Satoshi himself, for example here: 




Why not take a open source game and modify it according to your needs/theories yourself (or pay someone to do that)? "Someone should" = "noone will" in most cases...

That would mean it's looking like it is anonymous but in fact isn't.

You have your last closed ledger (the most recent one that was agreed upon in the network) that contains the full state of the network (balances, trust lines, market offers...). The server would get e.g. a transaction where Jennifer tries to spend 1 trillion XRP. It then checks how much is in her account (let's say 1000 XRP). Since XRP balances can't be negative, that's an illegal transaction, so Jennifer just gets an "invalid transaction" error and the server would not consider this transaction valid.

TOR does not prevent phishing, if at all, it might encourage MITMing from evil exit nodes...
Edit:  
Since this became top comment, some clarifications:  
TOR is basically used to hide your IP from the server you're connecting to (in this case blockchain.info won't know OP's IP address) by instead routing traffic through so called "exit nodes" (servers that offer to surf the web "on your behalf"). These don't necessarily always play nice and might automatically look for passwords entered or even actively try to keep people from using secure connections or (worst case) connect securely to a server on one side and pretending to be that server to the TOR user (called MITM or "man in the middle" attack).
I'm sorry for OP and other victims (especially since s/he seemed to care about security and used TOR), "be your own bank" has it's downsides too unfortunately.
Tl;dr - TOR protects you from someone logging your IP, it does NOT mean you are on a secure connection to the internet at all! It is your responsibility to ensure that whoever you're talking to is who you think it is.

Afaik they still make all transactions public but it is not as easy as in Bitcoin to see where a certain transaction ends up, as they get bundled together.

Are these surety bonds something that has to be done for each state individually or is it more of a "you have to have at least X amount" stuff? Meaning do you look for the max value in that column or the sum?

Since there is usually a lot of confusion what Ripple is and how it works, there are three main elements to Ripple (unfortunately(??) all called something very similar):
Ripple the technology/idea by Ryan Fugger.   
This is an idea of building a "digital Hawala" network by offering micro-credits to a lot of people you know for small sums and has the potential for cutting out banks etc. as middle men when transferring value. RippleLabs builds a protocol based on these ideas.
Ripple the platform/decentralized market place.   
This is what Fidor apparently uses or plans to use. Code (since some people incorrectly like to claim it is not open source):  Documentation at  This is a way to allow anyone (companies or individuals) to create, transfer and trade so called "IOUs" (which can represent whatever the issuer intends them to represent). One typical mode of operations would be to be an escrower for some assets like USD or BTC and then hand out "IOUs" for the amounts deposited afterwards. This is how Bitstamp as a Ripple gateway operates for example (they hold BTC/USD and you can "withdraw" money from your Bitstamp internal account to your Ripple account if you have deposited it to Bitstamp earlier).
To ensure that you only receive IOUs from issuers you actually know about, you tell the Ripple network via "trust lines" how much of each currency from each issuer you will at most accept.
Ripple the cryptocurrency.   
Since anyone can issue anything on Ripple in any quantity, IOUs are not fit to pay for fees (spam prevention). This is why a special currency was introduced, called "ripples" or "XRP". This (like Bitcoin) is an unbacked(!) asset that only exists within the Ripple network and has no representation outside of it. Unlike Bitcoin (who uses Proof of Work as a probabilistic method to distribute the issuing of currency parts) XRP were issued centrally and distributed to "the founders" (20%, Jed McCaleb and whoever else is in this group) and RippleLabs (80%, they pledged to distribute a large portion of this, so far ~8% of XRP are not in their hands any more, see  One issue that people have with this ("premine" accusations aside) is that there is no clearly announced action plan how they will distribute these XRP widely and there is an ongoing debate how it should happen anyways. Things that were already tried and stopped again: Giving money to people on mailing lists, in forums (you could get loads of them on bitcointalk a year or so ago), for solving work units on the world community grid (a BOINC enabled project for using computational power to crunch scientific data for research), giving XRP to people who open accounts on gateways... currently they stopped all public giveaways and seem to be planning to incentivize market makers and upcoming gateways instead of giving XRP directly to the masses.

Why should people who do track these tell you? After all that is quite powerful information and not too easy to come by. So it would make sense to keep this info private and use it to trade with more information than most other people out there (e.g. maybe someone is slowly dumping 80k BTC from MtGox? Then you can see if there are even more about to be sold and enter a short position).

Depends on your definition of blockchain - it has very similar (only improved in some areas) data structures as Bitcoin, transactions are bunched together in a tree structure and headers contain cryptograhic proof of these transactions and previous headers.
It is not secured by PoW mining but by a distributed algorithm they call "Consensus", similar to PoS but wiht the main difference that each node does not consider on-chain assets for trustworthiness of a validator but chooses their validators freely. The main thing to ensure is that the validators you choose do not collude secretly against you (compared to Bitcoin: the majority of mining power must not collude against you).

They also decided to cut a feature from Ripple (incomplete payments) claiming it is a vulnerability instead of doing research on why this feature exists.
Not to be too harsh on them (they try hard to maintain their fork and it takes some time to dive into a code base), but so far the Stellar team (including Jed) made some quite questionable changes even to core components of Ripple without seemingly a lot of discussion. I think they are not capable to port their fork to current rippled code, that is of course just my opinion.

"Europe" is a bit not so specific... so it is a bit hard to come up with concrete things.
Anyways, your other daughter seems to have been not that smart (e.g. exchanging USD at the airport for huge markups?) - Usually when I need foreign money, I withdraw at ATMs in that country with my debit card, pay with credit card or get a stack of local currency at a local bank at home before taking the trip. Worked in half a dozen countries outside the Eurozone without any problem.   
Paying in plastic has the advantage that there is no loose change left at the end of the trip, also credit card companies usually have relatively fair conversion rates.
   
Depending on where your daughter is going to, you might also find someone there who wants to go to the US or needs USD and sell your USD over the counter for EUR. You could also do this virtually (if you find/know someone trustworthy) e.g. you deposit 1200 USD at my exchange account, I give your daughter 890 EUR in cash when she drops by - which would be an amazingly good rate by the way.
If you "have" to use Bitcoin, just send her to a local meetup and notify the organizers beforehand so there's someone who actually wants to buy coins in that quantity and she is expected. Might also help to let her get to know a few local nerds... :D

Instead of a hardcoded list (compiled into the binary!), a config file that maybe even includes some basic regex might be a better solution. Also making this modifiable (and probably switching it off by default, to match upstream functionality in the default configuration) would be good to have. Wasn't there even a patch over a year ago, that would add some blacklisting even to the UI (once SD started seriously spamming the block chain)? Is this a descendant of that code or your own solution that you wrote back then?
@_date: 2014-10-21 06:31:34
Ripple does not call their transaction tree "block" (unlike Bitcoin) and also contains an AccountState tree (the Bitcoin equivalent would be a tree built deterministically from the UTXO set at a certain height, there are already some ideas/projects that do this for BTC too). Other than that, a Ripple ledger is very similar to a Bitcoin block.
Yes, you are definitely correct, just like trades in fiat &lt;--&gt; BTC, typically some third party holds on to the fiat money until you get cash. Unlike fiat &lt;--&gt; BTC exchanges, they are all running on the same network, don't need to have their own trading engine (hence the name "gateway", not "exchange") and can focus purely on the function of handling deposits/withdrawals.

The solution is "proof of work", so they could find anything that is difficult to make or produce (doesn't have to be calculation based) that is easy to verify but hard to reproduce.
Also the solution is just used to decide between forks which is the one to use. The block chain itself is a simple data structure that is already long known and pretty standard. It has nothing to do with the Byzantine problem.
Historically for example debts were tracked using wooden sticks with marks that were split in two ( probably a scheme could be devised with these too.
PoW might be doing some intricate stuff with the message (writing it especially nicely or conforming to a very formal standard) that is hard to learn/master, then comparing all incoming messages and following the best looking report from each general that has the least variation from the standard (e.g. the straightest letters or the most difficult paintings/illustrations all over the letter).
Maths might be easier, but I am not so sure how far it was developed back then. Maths beyond "dozen" were usually a secret guarded by priests to calculate calendars etc. though larger numbers might have been useful in military too. Manipulating these numbers (e.g. factoring) might not be so important though, so depending on the maths available, it might not be too useful.

CoinJoin just takes M inputs from up to M different parties and joins them to N outputs that go to up to N different parties.
It "protects" against the assumption that all transactions that have more than 1 input were created by a single person, so it is similar to a bunch of people on a table each throwing in 10 USD for the beer they drank making it impossible for the waiter to know if that was a single person or everyone at the table contributing.

It is possible to see the result of that distribution (and it is not very hard to at least see Ripple Labs + founders accounts, they would have been pseudonymous anyways even with the transactions visible).
You still evade the question about 100% fair distribution - Bitcoin's PoW is definitely not 100% fair at all, since it suffers from serious issues with information asymmetry in the beginning (someone joining now can get far fewer BTC than someone joining 3 years ago, like me).

As that rule would be a hard fork, not a soft fork, you'd need all node operators globally to make the switch until then - not just 51% of miners.
As soon as the first block with more than 1 million bytes gets mined after that time, old nodes will fork off (as it is invalid according to them) and stop working on the main chain.

Most likely yes, there are only few transactions that pay enough fee to offset the added costs of higher orphan rates. No free transactions make 0 sense economically, unless they are your own.
They don't save "computational time" - they make their blocks propagate AND validate faster for other nodes (so they save computational time of other nodes), so if they and a pool with 1 MB blocks solve a block at the same time, theirs is more likely to "win". As you risk 25 BTC there each time, adding free transactions is actually stupid. Many pools do it nevertheless, either because they don't know how to change it or don't care that their miners make a slight loss or out of other motives (so people hate on pools that behave more logical for example, like you do).

Not just "fee only": "fee per kB above what you loose by making blocks larger".
An even better strategy would be to analyze the transactions on how fast they can be verified and factor that into your minimum fee needed (there is delay both for verification AND bandwidth). I'm not too sure if that would really pay off (until someone hits you with a transaction that runs in a loop or something for hours...) though.
Edit: And yes, short of running the ~26% attack on the whole network (which takes forever to earn you something) this should be the optimum strategy for any miner imho.
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:01:09
Push block size up to fork off (or at least increase the orphan rate) of miners on the other side of the network or with weaker bandwidth.
If there is a lot of mining power concentrated in a section of the network that is much faster interconnected than the rest of the system, this will drastically increase operational costs for anyone who is not part/member of that network.
This is a real threat considering how much mining power is concentrated in a few countries.
Also it (depending on the implementation of that "feature") might be possible to artificially keep bock size smaller than necessary to force higher transaction fees.

@_date: 2015-05-06 10:51:10


No, transaction volume (which is free to generate for miners, they can just send BTC between their own addresses for free) increases the block size. Bitcoin adoption lately seems to mainly happen off-chain in bank-like institutions like Coinbase, Circle etc.

I highly suspect you're off by several orders of magnitude...
@_date: 2015-05-22 12:20:32
Well, if you can trade the same thing for example batched every 10 seconds and batched every 1 second, you'd be easily able to front run. The platform being centralized or not does not really matter in that case as long as you don't keep your funds on there for extended periods of time... The only way to prevent front-running is to trade on the fastest matching engine/exchange available. This is a single entity and VERY likely a centralized one due to reduced consensus requirements (you only need to agree with yourself, not with others).
Trading on Bitcoin natively if ordering of offers can still change for MINUTES is simply no option. Current decentralized/distributed solutions seem to either provide "eventual" blockchain synchronisation (e.g. keep a seperate chain with additional ordering guarantees and use Bitcoin as global state every now and then) or simply don't deal with Bitcoin at all other than storing them (the "gateway" approach).

If you deposit 10 BTC with Coinbase, they can freeze ("send a blood sample, or you're not allowed to transfer these 10 BTC") or seize ("the 10 BTC you sent us were earned through illegal means - we forwarded them to the DEA"). Similar with Ripple gateways: they can leave the money with you and just deny you transfers (freeze, visible in the ledger) or take the underlying asset and deny you withdrawals alltogether (seize, not visible in the ledger directly - they can not manipulate your balance but they can deny withdrawals and would likely also freeze your trust line)

It is only useful if the thing you burn is well distributed.
In some sense for example Bitcoin "burns" electricity (via computations) to distribute the currency units.
With fiat it might be possible, but then again it is poorly distributed. There are some ideas with mobile phone numbers, government IDs... but doing stuff like that in a trustless way is really hard and PoW is actually in my opinion still one of the more "fair" ways to let anyone participate.

With Bitcoin's PoW everybody with computing power can be their own little dictator for a block in the chain - in Ripple's Consensus you can vote for as long as you want... as long as nobody adds you as an "M of N", you are 100% powerless.
Bitcoin has the novel approach of using PoW not just for double spend prevention but also for distribution, a problem that's imho harder than double spend prevention. Ripple (and apparently Ethereum with ether) simply circumvents this problem by issuing everything centrally and leaving distribution to other systems they interface with.
Lots of "Bitcoin" merchants actually do use something like Ripple: They pay 1% fee to Coinbase or BitPay to receive USD instead of BTC.
Anyways, another tough problem is who decides who these "few dozen servers" are. Maybe users should do that within their transactions ("this TX should be validated by A, B, C and D"), maybe server operators get to choose ("If A, B, C and D agree, I agree as well"), maybe a randomizing algorithm might work too, similar to PoS.

If they really needed donations, they could already have posted a paypal address or bank info on there... They just link to their website on the prague map for example where you can donate and that's how I would personally prefer it.

By allowing you to choose your gateway(s) before you interact with them. You can apply all kinds of systems on top (insurance, ratings...), in the end this is a systemic risk with money transactions - the mechanism to convert something you already have to something that represents the thing you have and vice versa (be it USD, BTC, an Amazon coupon...) requires trust. The only way for trustless transfer is to stay within the same system - but in Bitcoin for example this just means that you can only trade one unspent output script for some other unspent output script.


Nothing, again, this is something that affects each and every kind of "decentralized exchange" out there to some degree (trading face 2 face in cash might have a different risk profile than accepting PayPal transactions, but still is not 100% failure risk free)

Insolvency = you owe people more money than you have available at the moment.

Can you explain more clearly what you mean by this? There is nothing that can be "pushed" onto other nodes in Ripple (which Stellar has forked a while back) consensus-wise. Stellar seems to have messed with Consensus-critical code though since then, so it is not 100% clear if this fork could have happened in Ripple too or not.

That's a big "if" and not something most exchanges currently are willing to disclose (in most cases you don't even get to see an overview of all addresses used by an exchange).

The paper seems to speak of address reuse:


they were received, how long did it take the recipient to spend
them? Figure 3 shows breakdowns both in terms of public keys
(how many recipient public keys spent their contents in a certain
time window) and in terms of value (how many of the bitcoins that
were received were spent in a certain time window).
If you send funds to a new address, they will contribute to that "pubkey that has never spent coins" part, no matter how often they were transacted before.
The numbers in the paper are possibly correct (and a high percentage here is actually good - ideally this number would be close to 100% to prevent pubkey leakage), the conclusions are not. It seems even the paper authors misunderstood that metric. ("Nevertheless, these early hoarders in fact took most of the bitcoins out of circulation; as observed by Ron and Shamir [18], a significant majority of all bitcoins are in these “sink” addresses that have to date never spent their contents (at the time they parsed the block chain it was 75%, whereas we observed it to be 64%), *meaning only 4 million bitcoins are currently in circulation.*" is WRONG)
Compared to cash the equivalent would be: "90% of the bills in your wallet have never been in your wallet before" (would be possible to check if you noted down all serial numbers you encounter), NOT "90% of the bills in your wallet are brand new and have never been transacted before".
Edit:  
 is the paper they reference. They (correctly) state: "For instance, there are as many as 43,710 components (about 33%) consisting of a single address which are used only for accepting (one or several batches of) freshly minted bitcoins, and which have never participated in any incoming or outgoing transactions".  
The close to 80% "unused coins" number comes from this passage:

Bitcoin (the network) does not use encryption anywhere, certain implementations might use it to protect e.g. private keys. Whatever reaches the network in transactions is not encrypted though, it is not that hard to use a client without any encryption.
As you can see from the second link, encrytion is (maybe) used locally by your wallet but has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself. If you choose to store your USD in a safe at home, this does not mean that someone else might not just stuff them in a mattress. There is no requirement for you to store your cash in any certain way and it's similar with private keys. Encrypting them might be a smart thing to do, but has nothing to do with their actual use.

First of all, they misquoted Ron and Shamir (they speak of "almost 78%", not 75%). This might be just rounding though.
I already wrote an explanation above: Their methodology measures address reuse, not the amount of time these addresses have not been used since they were first created. If I send 1 million BTC TODAY to a fresh address, they will consider these as being "out of circulation". If I then spend a single Satoshi, the whole 999999.99999999 BTC in this address are considered as "in circulation" again. Indefinitely.
While I see the appeal of writing a complete peer reviewed paper, they only made this small error in their paper from a quick glance, so I don't really see the point in wasting lots of bits and time just for a single small correction. Hence the idea of sending them a mail. If you don't feel that you're qualified, I can understand that perfectly - feel free NOT to send a mail then and just make a mental note that "doctorate in their field" does not always mean that someone is understanding everything 100% (neither am I or anyone else in this thread).
As I said elsewhere: Writing a complete paper just to disprove a tiny point in their paper that gets constantly misquoted on reddit (Oh the horrors!) takes time and thus money. If you want to have my opinion of 5 pages including source code, references and scientific lingo, feel free to fund this effort. I get it that reddit (and especially this circlejerky section here) is not the right forum to disprove scientific papers, however this is where OP decided to post, so this is where I answer.
Edit: The paper of Ron and Shamir is correct: 33% of BTC at that time haven't beeen moved and ~78% of all BTC addresses have not yet signed an outgoing transaction. The paper of Meicklejohn et.al. seems to have not read the conclusion of Ron and Shamir right in the next sentence after they state the 78% value:

As you already said, money transfer + escrow is a regulated business, so the contracts would be the existing MSB laws + EULAs of the escrower. People are only required to find an escrower they trust to process withdrawals + deposits and who has enough liquidity between his balances and ones of other escrowers.


The cryptocurrency side can be done by different agents or even programs: Bitcoin is native digital currency, traditional fiat money isn't. If someone accepts e.g. SEPA bank accounts as the "escrower" (or transfer network) for fiat transactions, then the bank doesn't need to accept BTC too to enable someone trading BTC.

It's at least a good indication, yes.
Still not too hard to fake (if only balances, not transactions get audited: Ask for a 1 day loan, audit balance, repay loan) and I wouldn't release funds anywhere just because someone shows me that they sent off the transaction if you think of the application of "making P2P fiat transactions confirm faster". Still lots of time to call your bank agent and claim you mistyped or were hacked or...

Instead of HAVING to trade through Bitcoin in your example (selling EUR.Visa, buying Bitcoin, selling Bitcoin, buying USD.Coinbase for example) you can take any path that has a market with offers.
The same problem with gateways shutting down exists with Bitcoin exchanges too... BTC.MtGox are not exactly liquid at this point. As long as other exchanges typically don't outsource their funds though (a notable exception was e.g. Bitcoinica keeping all their funds on MtGox), there can't be any cascades as deposits are independent of each other.
You were quite perfectly describing Ripple in your posts above, only with the limitation that trades have to route through BTC instead of taking arbitrary paths, which likely would increase slippage and costs along the way (in your example there might be a good chance that there is a direct EUR.Visa &lt;--&gt; USD.Coinbase market).

A transaction is cross-financed by giving ~10$ worth of BTC to miners on average, most of that does not come from fees but from coinbase transactions though. It is not easy to decide if that is just part of inflation, part of a "fee" or something else.

How would anyone except Bitstamp be able to show that their debt towards their users is smaller than the amount of BTC they own? They could easily create 1 fake account that they control and know that this account holder will not verify their merkle branch where they can dump all their debt.
One of the few systems I know of where externals can audit balances in real-time is Ripple (some other "Bitcoin-2.0 systems" might also be able to provide this). This would hand the actual exchange business to a blockchain though and degrades current exchanges to simple escrowers/aka. "gateways" and might have other issues, such as slower trading speeds.

I use more than that per month at home, also a lot for crypto nodes, lately more for the bootstrap torrent file though, as it is much more efficient that way.
Still opening the port for Bitcoin-QT means that I have to work with QoS rules in my router (who then tends to get overloaded from the extra work) which are not reliably, still randomly choke my connection and won't help the network either, as I would just slow down someone bootstrapping who could connect to a node with more/faster upload.

If setting fixed rates you risk not having your offers taken at all (if there are enough people around that are willing to take less interest than you) and also you risk undercutting the market severely with no chance of getting out of a contract (only the person borrowing from you can close prematurely).
If there is an upswing in price, you'll be stuck at your minimal acceptable rate (which you have to set as your offer, otherwise you'd be undercut all the time), if there is a downswing you'll not earn less but absolutely nothing while having the exact same operator risks of storing your BTC with/at Bitfinex.
While I support that people take a more active role and offer coins at rates they feel comfortable with, there apparently are enough users out there who are comfortable with ANY kind of return (which is represented by either FRR or manual undercutting via lending bots) above 0 to make this strategy not very viable at all.
It's like going to a bank and demanding a smallish savings account with 20% yearly interest. You'll simply not find any bank that will take up your offer. The you have the choice: Do you actually want at least some returns or are you not willing to let go of your money in any case if it returns less than 20%/year? While you seem to be in the latter camp, people who choose the former strategy are the ones who will actually earn something. If trading gives such sure returns, just go long (or short) BTC with your coins instead of lending them out, rates seem to be low in both USD and BTC markets anyways. Filling the order book with offers that won't be taken (or won't be taken for long) does not really help anyone.

This is definitely not "very powerful" at all and does not sound very future proof to me (I would expect a 300 USD machine to be able to run for at least 5 years).
I'd recommend to run nodes at LEAST on something like an Intel NUC. Yes, it is more expensive, but depending on what Ethereum turns out to be, it is likely going to require some real ressources too.
Then again, I do not sell this stuff and I don't want to bitch around without offering alternatives, so good on the people from chainbot for actually at least releasing something I guess... let's hope their next iteration has replaceable/upgradeable parts (RAM! Storage! gBit Ethernet! USB3!).
Also I would be VERY careful with something that comes with stuff like "Custom ChainBot Linux Kernel 3.8.x Crypto-Optimized" pre-installed while there is no mention what the changes for this Kernel are and when they might change to a more recent Kernel (3.8 is about 2 years old by now).

Sure, Ripple is similar to a focussed and streamlined implementation of colored coins on a specialized blockchain.
A few details are different (e.g. Ripple does not use scripts but actual balances in transactions and will rely on an external project for scripting capabilities, also Ripple nodes can sync up to the network in under a minute compared to several hours in BTCland...) and a few features (e.g. multisig) are still in development, they are definitely already possible or planned. Also there are some features that Bitcoin definitely lacks, for example trading capabilities including atomic trades over several markets, pathfinding, the ability to attach larger pieces of data to transactions, a hashed equivalent of Bitcoin's UTXO set in the headers... and some things that are lacking compared to Bitcoin, especially 3rd party (re-)implementations/wallets, some documentation (especially p2p code), there are "slight" storage issues (you think 30 GB for a block chain are a lot? Try &gt;1 TB!) if you want full history and you will attract trolls in comment-heavy Bitcoin-heavy communities (e.g. threads on reddit rarely survive more than a day, so people have a more direct style of "discussing" and disagreeing with you, which often boils down to "DIE RIPPLE DIE", "SCAM!" or "shill"). Especially the last point really can get to you, this is not a nice and welcoming community at all on Reddit - even bitcointalk is better in that regard.
About the native asset (BTC vs. XRP) - well, we are in after all, also I'm not a big fan of XRP myself even though I like Ripple.
Anyways, in the end Ripple at least is/will be a great way to buy/sell Bitcoins if nothing else, since transactions there are also irreversible. Please don't try to push too hard to make Bitcoin work closer like Ripple (this will only make Ripple more attractive, as it is far better suited e.g. in the scenario you outlined and this will only lead to frustration), rather make Bitcoin great to use by itself.

About real time: Apparently people were still trading like crazy with lag spikes of several seconds or even minutes on Gox and other platforms. "Very very real" and "they" is still very vague. There is some correlation between trading speed and volume of Bitcoin exchanges (more volume on centralized, faster exchanges than on e.g. Localbitcoins), a more important factor for volume after trading speed is down to below 1 second/trade seems to be low fees though.

Abandon the idea of a "hot wallet" alltogether and only process withdrawals a few times a day in batches from cold wallets only.
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:13:48
Well, before withdrawals they would do the following check:
Sum of all BTC owned by them at timestamp X  
- Sum of all BTC withdrawals pending  
compared to: Sum of all account balances at timestamp X according to their internal ledger
Also add a few safeguards probably (e.g. no negative account balances after withdrawing).
It is hard to mess up the amount of BTC owned, as long as they know which addresses they own, they can use a completely new copy of the block chain every few hours... The "hacking" would likely have to modify their internal ledger which would probably be a bit expensive computation wise to check + verify after each trade. It is not impossible though.
Anyways, this discussion is kinda moot, as apparently customers kinda demand and expect instant withdrawals, still I find it negligent to keep 18k(!) BTC in a hot wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:49:42

No, it doesn't. Miners (and full nodes) will still want to inspect every single transaction in a block, only building upon a valid header is risky and makes you open for attacks. Also you don't know which transactions to include, so you'd have to mine a coinbase-only block until you have verified the full previous block.

Well, they might already be used to that from banks (which do exactly this for exactly these reasons), but I agree that customers currently seem to rather have instant withdrawals than wait a few hours and have their funds secured better at the platform.
What I find weird though: Why are BTC _deposit_ addresses at risk at Bitstamp? If I were to implement an exchange, I'd make sure deposits are (deterministic) cold wallet addresses and never ever on any kind of hot wallet system.

Ideally if you are really interested in the stuff on blockchain.info, you'd run your own block explorer locally. Unfortunately that creates already now quite a bit of data (or I/O if you parse the blockchain instead on the fly) so it is not that much of a viable solution.
Remember: Every time you check an address at blockchain.info, they know someone at your IP is interested in exactly that address and knows it from somewhere (as typing random strings as addresses does not really work). Act accordingly.

Main takeaway: Do NOT deposit to the same BFX deposit address that you used so far but generate a new one in a few hours/days.

This is about miners though, who get paid for their work, not people buying BTC. To sustain current difficulty levels with current technology, hardware prices and electricity costs it DOES cost 30-40 USD to confirm a transaction.

Deterministically choosing inputs from all inputs available to you makes it much easier to see later during offline analysis which inputs could have been available to you and which can be excluded, e.g. all older UTXOs than the ones you used as inputs.
I'm not so sure what this should have to do with change addresses or outputs.
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:35:00
If you sign an automatically prepared multi-send transaction e.g. every 8 hours offline(!), there is no way that your private keys get compromised, only that there are withdrawals in there that are inserted maliciously.
You can still mess that part up (MtGox is a good example where wallets were safe but their internal ledger/database was messed up), however you wouldn't have to require your customers to change deposit addresses in case you process a wrong withdrawal. Also I'd expect that they do some verifications of balances before withdrawals are finally approved anyways.
@_date: 2015-05-06 02:55:48
Ripple gateways are kinda equivalent to Bitcoin services where you deposit your coins and get a balance on their platform in return that you can use for trading etc. (only that in the case of Ripple you get a balance inside Ripple, not in the hidden accounting system of $exchange). These balances are under the full control of the person you deposited your coins with. If you use the native network asset directly (Bitcoin: BTC, Ripple: XRP), this cannot be frozen/seized, as it doesn't belong to anyone other than the network itself.

Possible other case 5, asl alternative to 1 ("Kicking the can down the road"): Hard-fork to a larger fixed block size (e.g. 4 MB) while also implementing SegWit. This keeps block size control outside of the chain (unlike e.g. a scaling mechanism that looks at the last N blocks or similar to calculate max block sizes) and doesn't give miners control over it while potentially winning back enough hash rate to compete with BU.
As far as I understood, some properties of SegWit (malleability fixes) are also needed for Lightning, which is the by far more compelling use case.

It's an extremely low number, but still more than the current system can handle.
If 10 TPS can be handled, it means that there has been some actual fundamental change and then you can also find out how high the network will actually scale after that change. 10 TPS and 1000 TPS capabilities will likely come at the same time...

I don't care if it "counts" - it is a working example (since 2012) on how UTXO-commitment style designs can be implemented. I'm sure if Bitcoin adapts something like that, it will be more customized to its needs. It will look very similar though in the ideal case (hard fork for an additional header field - there probably has to be one breaking change for enabling larger timestamps anyways in the next 90 years), probably a deterministic tree hash.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:40:10
As far as I've understood it, you'll enter debit account, credit account (as in double entry) AND additionally a reference to a public record of settlement/transfer (which in the banking system might be your "reference number" or something like that - however without access to the bank's full ledger you can't verify this). In Bitcoin, you would reference the TransactionID for example.
This still has issues with giving proof that this payment was actually directed at you and is not just any random one on the network, but there are potential solutions to this as well (e.g. using a HD wallet and signing a message containing your HD pubkey with the HD privkey for example)

Ripple's "account_state" hash represents their version of a UTXO commitment (a tree structure of all currently spendable balances, order book states and some other information). Their headers contain a timestamp, a root hash of a transaction tree and the root hash of this account state tree, which in Bitcoin would translate to a deterministically generated UTXO structure (they represent the spendable balances and Bitcoin needs no order books natively as it contains only a single native asset --&gt; bitcoins).
Apparently they moved their documentation from their wiki to a seperate page at  in case you are interested how they do stuff.

As soon as you download block X from a peer and verified its hash, you can prune away all outputs that are spent in that block.

Scalability too, miners don't care out even know if they build a 1mb or 1 gb block, all they get is a root hash to build upon.

Also every website of a German company has to have an imprint. Coinbase doesn't.

99% correct, but it depended on the single one peer you downloaded your entire block data from. Since people run Bitcoin-QT on their shitty home lines or crappy overprovisioned VPS re-re-re-re-resellers, this often lead to syncing from a horribly slow peer. It could be fixed by connecting to a good, fast one though, if you knew the IP + port.

Not natively, yes.


Not really, it is about as "centralized" as OkPay being able to freeze funds on their platform. Accounts can't be blocked, only issuers can freeze the assets they issued themselves (e.g. Bitstamp froze about 1 million USD recently). Coinffeine apparently only has a single fiat gateway, Ripple has several.


Also not really, you can exchange fiat on several platforms OR actual money (cash) against Localbitcoin BTC-denominated balances/IOUs that you might or might not be able to redeem.


Those multiple payment processors verly likely will have to be heavily regulated and can freeze accounts, cancel transactions, refuse to transact or refuse to pay out at will or at the whim of a regulative body.

Anything that can be identified in Bitcoin (e.g. a transaction output, a transaction output TYPE, transactions signed by a certain key...) can be also ignored (=frozen) by miners. If your assets are identifiable or partially identifiable (e.g. one input to a coinjoin transaction definitely belongs to you) you can be targeted.
It peobably would depend on the situation if miners would also risk freezing other people's assets just to keep you from transacting (e.g. the "Satoshi haircut": coinbase outputs from the first 20k blocks will not be processed as they are most likely Satohi's premine/early solo mining activity - but not exclusively).
Coinjoin volume is so minimal on the network that they hardly matter anyways so far, there are a few ways I think how to deal with these in a freeze scenario which could range from simply disallowing coinjoin type transactions to probabilistic approaches.

As soon as an open communications channel opens up that is not just an echo chamber (e.g. Bitcointalk, IRC, dev-mailing list, this subreddit initially, github issues...) both "buttcoin"ers and "to the moon"ers drag every little controversy out of context and brigade, spam and rally against mainly the messenger, not the message.
An example? It is perfectly fine for miners to accept double spends, choose the highest fee paying one (or select in ANY other way that they seem fit between double spends) and mine that. The only thing that prevents wide spread double spends is the fact that bitcoin-core at the moment only forwards the first transaction it ever has seen, after that it silently censors double spends as long as the transaction is in its mempool. Making this behaviour adjustable and/or more explicit gets treated as if the world as we know it is coming to an end, illuminati are pushing their secret agendas and the lizard people of [REDACTED] are going to [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] while [REDACTED] are [REDACTED] their [REDACTED].

Bitcoin has about 100k - 200k transactions per day max. lately (source: 
Ripple has more than that typically, but in the same order of magnitude for now (source:  documentation:  some good days (e.g. March 3rd 2015) had over 640k transactions.
The issue is that transactions in Ripple are not 100% comparable to Bitcoin transactions, as not all transactions move money directly - most of them are just bots posting/removing offers. Pure payment type transaction volume is about 50% of Bitcoin so far.

1st: "Ausgang/Wechseln" - wat? "Innovationen" sounds nondescriptive and you didn't translate "Peers". Also I find it an interesting design choice to essentially write "BS" right in the middle of your UI. Last but not least, we use the comma as decimal seperator, not the dot.  
2nd one: "Wählen Sie **I**hre Sprache.". "Spezifische Sprache verwenden" sounds a bit strange, are there unspecific languages to choose from too?  
5th: "Platzierung: Führende" (placement: the leading) sounds a bit weird. Also you only give an indication about the "symbol" that is used, I guess that you also multiply by 1000 if mBTC is selected there?

@_date: 2015-04-16 16:27:17
Because Ripple Labs holding a lot of XRP just increases risks for them - as long as you don't speculate on XRP, you don't really need to care about their price if you already have some. 1 USD worth of XRP will be enough for the forseeable future to do thousands of trades and transfers irrespective of the amount of value the transactions represent. 1 USD worth of BTC might pay the transaction fee for maybe a dozen or so transactions if you get lucky and they will contain 1 USD worth of BTC in value at max.

I have my doubts about the irreversibility (and also trustworthiness) of OKPay, but I agree that this is probably the best you can do so far  if you want to exchange Bitcoin you own with someone else for something that you get to own instead.
What I'm criticising is the notion that this would be "easy" to build and that it uses any ~~crucial~~ unique feature of Bitcoin itself - it could be used just the same for exchanging between OKPay and PayPal, if both would offer small, fast, irreversible payments. I'd love to see this used in Altcoin exchanges by the way, where both sides can be implemented as microtransaction channel.
Last but not least, not everything people do makes sense, so all these "game theoretical" approaches for example wouldn't apply to an employee of OKPay who can just create balances out of thin air or someone who just wants to mess with your platform and is happy to spend a bit of money just to screw with a critical fraction of customers.

They are fungible between the same issuer (e.g. 1 BTC/Bitstamp and another one are exactly the same - even more than on the Bitcoin blockchain, as Ripple operates on balances, not transaction outputs). They are partially fungible (if you switch on that option, called "rippling") between IOUs in the same currency (e.g. 1 BTC/Bitstamp and 1 BTC/DividendRippler might be fungible, if you enable rippling and trust both Bitstamp and DividendRipple at the same time). They are never fungible between different currencies (e.g. USD and EUR), even with the same issuer, as there is no way for the network to automatically determine prices. This is why there is a market built into the protocol, so you can buy/sell and put up offers for whatever you'd like to trade.

I believe they want to market Ripple as platform that can host fully compliant businesses, not as only consisting of these. This is exemplified by implementing freezability but still allowing accounts to disclaim freezing completely.
We'll see how it works out in the future I guess, however the software was and still is open source, so if stuff is implemented that you don't like you can still remove it (as some people have already done) and you are even allowed to distribute the modified version as you like. I also don't get your comment about "certified clients", since the network itself is client agnostic - but I guess that's part of your "it might happen in the future" suspicion?

Bitcoin does not use any kind of consensus algorithm, it uses Proof of Work which is a quite brute force method to ensure with a certain probability that transactions remain immutable. It heavily depends on the goodwill of miners to accept other miner's valid blocks and build of top of these instead of trying to fork off the chain.
It is pretty easy to get patches accepted, if for some reason you don't manage to get something into the main repository, according to the license you are free to maintain a forked repository too. There are more people with direct commit rights in the rippled code base than in bitcoin-core.

No, it is about Ripple Labs asking Bitstamp to freeze USD that someone deposited on Bitstamp before. bitstamp complied but sued both parties (Ripple Labs and the account holder of the frozen balance) to force them to settle the issue between them.

Just use the account secret (your private key) that you were explicitly told to create a backup of to access your funds.
@_date: 2015-04-22 09:57:50
If you mean "source" by this:  ("As XRP does not have an issuer, it cannot be frozen.")
Freezing can only be done by the account in the "issuer" field, XRP have a blackhole account there by design for which (likely) no private key exists ( This means the only way to freeze XRP is to sign a transaction with a private key whose public key hashes to all zeroes.
Edit:  
I'm talking about the protocol here by the way, not the fact that Ripple Labs had control over all XRP since the beginning and effectively "issued" all XRP to themselves, selling off or giving away parts of that over time. Unlike other things on Ripple (IOUs, balances, whateveryoucallthem), they are not any longer able to control XRP once they give them away, they would if they were designing XRP to have Ripple Labs as issuer.

You have to trust your counterparties, at least with Ripple it is possible to know how much they claim to hold in funds. How many BTC does BTC-e's customers have credited? If they were operating on Ripple, you'd know that down to the Satoshi in realtime.

So why did they go through a lot of trouble and legal fees with the whole Jed situation (he owns ~9 billion XRP and threatened to dump them last year, then signed a contract that he would only sell a certain amount per week and recently seems to have sold a million USD worth of them, which potentially violated that agreement, leading in yet another lawsuit and Bitstamp freezing the account on the ledger)?
It would have been much cheaper and easier to just seize the funds or immobilize them using their validators instead of risking a trial.

Still hidden forks are possible to be forced upon the mainnet and participants have a very different view of the world every ~10 minutes after a block has been mined and is still propagating.
There is preference, but it is NOT forced at all - the only thing causing miners to build upon foreign blocks is that they often are not powerful enough to fork the whole network and rather have a little bit of money instead of all of it.

Rules are not arbitrary, the "consider all inputs relevant" algorithm for example gives you an upper bound of blocks to consider as potential ancestors for a certain TXO and allows you to exclude large portions of the blockchain as definitely irrelevant.
Coins do have a deterministic dependency tree (meaning they NEED a certain transaction to have happened in the past for the current transaction to be valid), which parts of this tree you consider as "history" and which not is up for debate. If you decide to consider the whole tree, you'd use the exact algorithm I wrote about.

This subreddit is really turning into the of Ripple. Nearly every day lately a post that bashes Ripple gets hidden after reaching a few hundred upvotes, even if it only remotely has to do with Bitcoin itself - often even with moderators commenting inside (in this thread: and Top comments are typically bashful statements like "Fuck Ripple", "Cripple", "RIPple" and so on with little to no actual content. Once someone corrects some typical wrong statements (e.g. "Ripple is not Open Source" --&gt;  the thread gets hidden or the poster gets called a "shill" (which is turning quickly into a quite meaningless accusation, close to "ponzi" in these circles).
While I get it that some people get upset about a cryptocurrency that is not mineable and a network that gives more power to gateways than they are used to, this is getting absurd, considering that most BTC are traded on platforms that can freeze assets at will, are not publicly auditable at all (which Ripple is), are also only trading IOUs and not on-chain BTC and make it much harder to move balances than necessary. On the other hand projects that only implement a subset of Ripple's capabilities (e.g. Tether) get praised.

They cannot be created after the initial creation, so the maximum amount is 100 billion XRP. Fees destroy XRP irreversibly, so they get fewer over time. They just "pop up" in a known account when starting a new network (similar to the first 50 BTC when mining a new genesis block) and you can then transfer them to an account that you control, which is what Ripple Labs did in the beginning. Since then they had several initiatives to give them away or sell them to fund their operations and/or grow the network.

No, Bitshares works by "freezing" their native tokens ("Bitshares" or BTS) to issue assets. The amount to be frozen is determined by external price feeds (e.g. someone signs and publishes a statement "1 USD = 100 BTS"). Then double that amount gets frozen (e.g. 200 BTS to create 1 BitUSD) to create the asset.
The risk you're taking on there is that not suddenly all price feed providers collude against you for whatever reason and that the price of BTS stays relatively stable. A 200% collateral means that the price can fall up to 50% in a short period of time (e.g. 1 USD = 200 BTS), below that, your BitUSD would no longer be covered by enough BTS.

There is only a single target merged in core at the moment though. Also I didn't find information about users or the infrastructure in place to run the actual fuzzing. Sorry, but I don't see how increasing your work load which apparently already (looking at the merge rate) is too high would improve things, especially by contributing code that could expose bugs - which trigger more work. I also disagree with your bug disclosure policy and some of your comments on the matter.
I guess I'll just wait a while for what you are uncovering with those "more than OSS-Fuzz resources" and see how your infrastructure is designed around this (after all Bitcoin was a leader in reproducible builds, maybe it'll lead the industry in self-deployed continuous fuzzing?). Also the stuff I have is not much different than  anyways, just with fewer switch statements and more binaries. Fixing that one up a bit should already get you quite far - though that was offered 4 months ago. PR  took about that long as well to get merged even though it was even simpler. This should also be more in line for the increased bug hunting phase in March towards the 0.16 release.

If you have 5 1 BTC outputs from A and 5 1 BTC outputs from B and then send 5 BTC, you are also giving a clear indication which ones (A, B or a mixture) you are using.
It is very wasy and clear to tell which ones you are using, the only difference is that there are no 100% obvious solutions. If 2 5 BTC inputs get spent in 2 5 BTC outputs, are these 2 50/50 mixed outputs or 2 completely seperate ones, directly originating from the 2 inputs? It is possible to argue in both ways and this is one of the reasons why "colored coins" are harder than some people think. As long as you have a consistent set of rule though, you can track BTC just fine.
For most practical purposes, you'll be interested in stuff like if a large part of the BTC you own or a large part of their history is closely linked to illegal activity. This is definitely possible to track. The question in the OP is a bit harder, as it is not exactly clear to answer if you consider that BTC can be mixed and very likely not possible to answer if you require outputs mapping directly to inputs (2 BTC+2 BTC inputs, 3 BTC+1 BTC outputs --&gt; mapping broken).

Since 0.10.0 (and 0.10.1) is released, this torrent is no longer needed - Bitcoin will load and verify data as fast as possible. In most cases your CPU will be the slowing factor, not the speed you receive data.
Downloading (e.g. via the torrent) and THEN verifying will definitely take longer than doing both at the same time.

Just because transactions and data structures need to comply to certain global rules does not mean that you have a consensus system. Inputs into e.g. an SQL database also need to follow the rules of the SQL definitions, that does not mean that they are globally linked.
Preference for the chain with most work is necessary but not enforceable in PoW, unlike in other systems. Miners who fork the chain are only punished (by getting no reward and being forked off) if they are too weak to fork the whole chain or don't manage to exploit shorter forks outside of the system.
This is very different to consensus systems like e.g. RAFT.

I disagree with that statement, the only problem are miners/pools that run with default rules or that are not aware that there is very little useful transaction selection code to maximize fee returns in bitcoin-core.
For example, it would make sense to only include a 2^n number of transactions in a block, offer to externals a way to pay the miner/pool to include their transactions for a flat (monthly/weekly) fee with 0 fees not to everybody who has old coins for free, do a bit of advanced searching for better fee paths (I think it's called "replace by fee" in some cases?), snatch up special transaction types like OP_TRUE...

Bitstamp would just have issued a global freeze on all balances, created a freezable new issuing address within 30 days and recreated the balances of customers. I doubt that they'd have continued with unfreezable balances once freezing was possible.

I'd be very surprised if you can do anything other than withdraw BTC from that "vault" (depositing would be probably also on-chain, you either deposit BTC directly or buy BTC with whatever Coinbase offers and transfer them to your "vault").
You could do abstract things (e.g. let someone sign a statement with a Bitcoin address and then issue currency based on that, similar to what this "CLAM" currency seems to do), really offering to trade BTC that are not deposited though seems quite a stretch to me.
Just having something like a webwallet as additional offer is nice and all - as I said, to actually use Coinbase, you'll have to transfer BTCover to them though.

Especially the Bitcoin side (e.g. for a BTC gateway) would be MUCH harder to fake though - users would probably demand a signed statement from a cold wallet address and they could audit you more or less live. Similar to what the guys at vaultoro seem to be doing, only that their customer balances are only claimed to be correct by them, not cryptographically secured or auditable.
More transparency is always better in my opinion and the only thing that can be faked is the amount of money users deposited with your service. You can't decrease this number, only artificially inflate it.

That action would be VERY visible and was not what happened, so apparently Ripple Labs rather was risking Bitstamp not complying to their request than just using their current power over the network. "Quite easily" is also a bit oversimplifying, as there would be a severe risk of a forked network.


See my edit.
BTC are also "issued" by miners, but they don't retain control once they transfer them to someone else. XRP are the same in this regard. Any other balance (e.g. USD) on Ripple still tracks the issuer (unlike what BTC does) and give this issuing account certain powers.
XRP are issued by nobody but are by default starting out in a known account. Ripple Labs took all issued XRP, kept some and gave some away. An analogy in Bitcoinland might be a mining pool that doesn't put individual miners' addresses in the coinbase transaction.

First quote is by the author itself, not Ripple Labs.  
Second quote too.  
Third quote is also not by Ripple Labs but by a gateway operator.
Bitcoin does NOT have an inbuilt market (some projects like Counterparty try to add that on top) and compared to Ripple has much higher fees and much slower transaction times. If you receive 100 USD worth of BTC, you cannot guarantee that they will be sellable for 100 USD in 2 weeks from now. If you receive 100 USD on Ripple from a trustworthy gateway, you can be sure that you can redeem them for 100 USD in 2 weeks. There are different risks associated with holding IOUs though, that's probably why Bitcoin is more concerned with its currency and Ripple more with its marketplace, gateways and transaction capacity.

XRP are useful because they are the native token/asset/currency and the only thing that can pay for transaction fees.
The network runs on open source decentralized nodes, the ledger is secured by a web of trust though instead of PoW mining. Also XRP are issued to a single account and then distributed by Ripple Labs, not popping up randomly if you get lucky with hashing.

Just checking if a signature is valid is not everything - you'll also have to look up if transaction inputs are not spent yet (so you need random access to the whole UTXO set) and a few other things. GPUs might be good at doing lots of small independent things in parallel, verifying if a block at a certain height is valid though might take too long for it to bother. There is some startup time, quite a bit of data to be transferred (UTXO set, transactions...) and if transactions are not only verified after being included into a block but also just while passing through your node, you'll constantly have to change these data structures too, which might lead to locking problems.
Feel free to experiment and benchmark this, I doubt that transaction verification will be ofloaded to a GPU or similar device any time soon.

Gateways can choose their customer base, you don't need any kind of permission by anyone to run one though. "Gateways" for the purpose of the protocol are completely normal accounts like any other.
There are Open Source implementation (e.g. Justcoin had one) on how to connect an existing backend with Ripple and there's also an example implementation called "gatewayd" by Ripple Labs (also Open Source) that you can use to build upon.
Ripple Labs themselves do not host or operate any gateways.
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:22:02
Ripple is not centralized, it is public ~1.5 years longer than that random article (and in development longer than Bitcoin itself in various forms) and nobody can shut down your account. If you decide to hold balances from a gateway though, they still might have some power over that value, similar to current Bitocin exchanges where you first have to send them USD and/or BTC before you can exclusively trade them on their private ledger. Ripple just makes this more transparent, it does not try to enforce non-freezability (unfortunately imho). It is possible though to disclaim freezing, so your account is no longer able to freeze any individual balances it issues.
Ripple also does not try very hard to be a currency, so your babies are safe probably... It contains one but is not very dependent on it for value transfer compared with Bitcoin for example.

Sure, but the institution whom you trust to hold your funds is able to freeze your account in the default setting, much like if you depositing BTC to Coinbase it doesn't help you at all that BTC are "unfreezable" - they are now under Coinbase's power.
This is not "Ripple" freezing an account, this is Bitstamp freezing an account on an external public ledger (Ripple) instead of secretly internally on their private ledger (which likely happens far more often).

Sure they can, just like anyone else. You can also write and publish code to create billions of BTC. You can even run such a client. It won't matter to the existing network though, same as for Ripple.
If they push through stuff most people don't agree with it likely will lead to a fork. If everyone agrees, then it won't. 100 billion XRP as a maximum amount is something all participants agree on, so it is very unlikely that a change would occur and be accepted by all stakeholders.

Last time Bitcoin forked in 2013, PoW was actually ignored (the chain that was forked off was longer than the one that was - manually - chosen by a handful of pool operators on IRC). Nontrivial fork resolution will always be a manual task, even in PoW.

Yeah, but only a bank for Bitcoins, not fiat money (which Transferwise does). If you want to compare a fiat transaction that starts in e.g. GBP and ends in USD, you can't just say "well, if you stay in BTC, you'd be able to do it much faster and cheaper...".
In Dogecoins this transaction would maybe have been even cheaper still. This does not mean that it would be a smart move to transfer 100k USD worth of DOGE instead.

I am not the one that makes these claims, you didn't yet provide proof for something that would be as easy as showing 2 links to a block explorer...
If you'll be more motivated I'm more than willing to bet some BTC on the fact that you're not going to be able to show any proof that any XRP were printed since January 2013. Want some easy money? Name a reputable escrow service and write up some terms and you can earn up to 5 BTC if you're willing to take part in this. That's by far enough money to reward you for the hassle of looking up a transaction that created XRP or 2 ledgers where new XRP came into existence.

You can't create BTC blocks realistically either and thus have no vote at the moment. At least running a Ripple node is not very hard or expensive and it likely will stay that way in the foreseeable future. In the distant future only time will tell for the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem.
It for example includes what is known in Bitcoin as "UTXO commitments", so it is possible to just get the latest block and start validating immediately instead of replaying the complete history from genesis first to get the current state. I'm not sure what you mean by "how will the network improve" - maybe an example would be that they plan to scale beyond the currently benchmarked ~1000 TX/s limit (Bitcoin: &lt; 10T X/s). As said, the software is free open source software, so no need to trust for upgrades, you can just take it and write them yourself.
This thread already goes on for a while, so I'm not sure if it is very useful to continue the question-answer game.

No, these are called "validators" - gateways are entities on the ledger that issue tokens/currency/IOUs/whateveryoucallthem.
I understand both Bitcoin and Ripple in detail and while your statements are not completely wrong, they are not really true either... 
There is nothing inherent to PoW that makes difficulty always go up (no, not even Moore's law) difficulty mainly depends on fees and miner subsidy times current BTC price factoring in hardware cost and efficiency (hashes per Watt). If difficulty goes up, either BTC price or efficiency went up or there are more fees paid on the network.
There is a LOT of incentive to compromise the Bitcoin block chain and people constantly try to do so. Even on the main chain (not testnet) tons of very weird transactions show up and even get mined from time to time... if you want an "interesting" exercise, try to write a "simple" blokchain parser.

The VPN provider gets all your traffic to analyze, all you have from them that they won't do that is their word. Also all you have from them rewarding being secretly already compromised is their word.
Also it depends on your spending patterns and what you spend your coins on if you remain anonymous. All your transactions since the beginning of Bitcoin are public knowledge, even in 50 years. One single purchase where the merchant then tells others whom a certain address belongs to could compromise your whole transaction history.

An additional risk is that depending on future legislation I might very well end up in either committing or helping in committing a crime as well as making my coins stand out like a sore thumb in the blockchain (CoinJoin is not exactly stealthy and not very common either).
While BTC should be fungible, they are at least traceable which has very high potential to reduce their fungibility in the future.
Another "risk" that I can think of is that I'd (hopefully, if business is good) regularly end up with very recently transmitted UTXOs which are more expensive if not even impossible to transfer.
Also I HAVE to store private key material on a machine that HAS to be live on the web to communicate with others in near-realtime. This could be resolved though e.g. by offering something like a "mixing Monday" where all proposals are batched together in 2-3 1 hour slots during every Monday and if one wants to take part in this, all you need to do is to get all proposals, sign them offline and submit them back within that hour. Makes it more difficult and slower though, but probably far more secure.

Based on my experience as miner and with pools actively attacking other cryptocurrencies, being exploited themselves by pool hoppers or simply stealing from their users by faking stats... no, they won't. Some definitely will, the majority however is probably not even capable of setting up a full node as solo mine fallback, let alone P2Pool.
Miners also don't seem to care what exactly they are mining anyways, since a huge percentage of them leave transaction processing to the pool operators and only provide hashing power with no vote capabilities other than (potentially) providing these hashing capabilities to someone else who also does transaction processing and selection for them. Most full node software out there is also very poor concerning functionality that miners would/could need. Apparently miners are far too often concerned with hash rates and not so much with actually making sure that they do a good job in assembling Bitcoin blocks.

Well, the disadvantage would be then that you don't have all blocks available all the time. I also am not 100% sure how they plan to implement pruning, since on the P2P level, Bitcoin still has too little granularity imho.
I would prefer a better (optional?) database for blockchain data, which might increase storage demands but could decrease load combined with finer grained P2P commands.
Are you really demanding "minimal" requirements (e.g. "at least 4 GB RAM, 100 GB HDD, dualcore CPU") or rather "maximum" requirements (e.g. "a full node implementation has to be able to run on a RaspberryPi 2 and stay synced on a 10/1 mbit internet connection")?

If another miner adds any of the 2 conflicting transactions (high or low fee), I can't mine the high fee one.
If other miners only mine low fee ones, they cut their profits. "First seen" does not make any sense in a global P2P system with max. speed of light communication. Also why should I limit myself to "first seen" when I can run a strategy of "highest paying" instead?
If I'm one of the few RBF miners the added benefit would even be that 0-conf is still (like currently) viewed as "kinda safe" (which it never was, the name itself is a hint that it is inherently broken), so I get even more chances to select the higher fee transactions that are sent out to make low fee ones "unstuck".

No, File1 is hashed (in cleartext), the hash result is used as key to encrypt the file and stored in the account of user 1 (since it cannot be recovered any more once the file is encrypted).
File2 is treated teh same and if the content is the same, the hash is the same and the resulting encrypted file is also the same. It now is enough to just add a link to the encypted file1 to the account of user 2, since the only way to produce this encrypted file would have been to also have access to the unencryted file.

Oh by the way, Austria has a national PKI already for years and you can use either the health ID card or your mobile phone to sign stuff securely and in a way that the signature is even recognized by law as equivalent to a physical one on paper.
You can file your taxes online, do online banking with it, various other government services too (I don't need that stuff too often, so I'm not 100% up to date) and currently there was a decision that you should be able to access your medical history remotely on demand with that card too. (
There is no international standard though, so e.g. if you go to Germany or Estonia (who also have national PKIs) you can't use their infrastructure directly. There are plans to harmonize this, but this kinda stuff takes years if not decades to roll out. As a result it doesn't really help you a lot outside of Austria and e.g. Bitcoin exchanges are reluctant to build in support for the few dozen Austrian/Estonian/German clients I guess (the Germans are usually even a bit more paranoid about that stuff, so even less adoption there...).
It's still nice to have, but definitely not something that doesn't have its downsides too. There is also a video from a CCC conference about the topic that you really should watch.

Nope, there are plenty of nodes out there that would continue to run the network, if XRP get destroyed in the process, the remaining ones would probably rise in value (just like Satoshi reappearing and sending 1 million BTC to the 1BitcoinEater... address) so the only effect would be that probably there would be a bit of confusion and good trade opportunities.

Requirement = running a computer that is connected to the internet and there is no direct monetary incentive to run a node just like in Bitcoin. Becoming a validator however just requires that you sign your current belief of how you think the next block should look like (in Bitcoin you also need to add a PoW), so it is not much effort after already running a node to also validate.
To become a gateway, you need a funded account on the ledger (= 20 XRP, if you buy a full USD worth of them you have plenty enough). Incentive is that you might have a way to store something that others might want to make tradeable on a decentralized marketplace that is in itself not that mobile (e.g. gold bars, cash money...). There are other applications possible too, the current main one however seems to be that a trusted entity receives money in various currencies, for safekeeping and depositors get issued currency on Ripple for their deposits that they can withdraw again from the gateway too.
Any account on Ripple can be a gateway, it only depends on OTHER accounts if they issue a trust line towards them hoe much they can issue (anyone can issue any amount to themselves of course, just like you can write a check on a piece of paper issued by you to yourself for 1 billion USD...).
Consensus does not involve gateways, only validators (gateways are on a different layer, just like Bitcoin miners have no idea of addresses - they don't even exist in the protocol). The process (including links to a more technical/mathematical whitepaper and a video) is described on

Bitcoin: Build data structure of transactions that are considered immutable and include the hash of the previous data structure to form a chain.
Ripple: Build data structure of transactions and account state that are considered immutable and include the hash of the previous data structure to form a chain.
The way one of these "blocks" is decided by the network to be immutable is different (Bitcoin: PoW aka. "mining", Ripple: Consensus) but the underlying structure is not very different.

Sooo... how many transactions per second does Bitcoin support again? Oh wait, don't worry, it will be taken care of in the future...
Anyways, Ripple transactions are irreversible. I'd LOVE to be in a future world where I can buy Bitcoins with irreversible payments that are denominated in fiat by banks. Currently operating an exchange is a huge mess of dealing with any kind of exploit and loophole people find in the existing banking system to send you money and then take it back after already having bought BTC.

Originally these stores were established to give disabled war veterans a place to work (you can still operate a small corner shop with one leg or one arm). Nowadays they sell all kinds of stuff, from tobacco to magazines, vouchers (for Amazon, Bitcoin, anonymous credit cards...), scratch tickets, lottery tickets...
You can't pay (yet) using BTC there, only buy a voucher that you can use to insta-buy BTC. I don't see how this is connected to smoking, other than that they also sell smoking supplies at the same place.

Used up too much bandwidth and it is too hard to block/filter transactions I consider spam from being relayed. I don't want to provide infrastructure for Satoshi's dice, thank you very much.
Currently I just run firewalled/non port-forwarded, which is enough for me to have a local trusted copy of the block chain without all the downsides of running a publicly reachable node. Still not too happy about it, as I don't want my node to connect to blockchain.info, blocktrail and other similar services... but better than allowing incoming connections at least.

Probably to allow someone issuing something on Ripple to retain control even if the issued balance is not any longer residing on the issuing account. Imagine it like Coinbase freezing your account until you hand them your ID, 3 recent bills and a blood + urine sample.
It is possible for any account to disclaim freezing forever (non-reversibly), so if you want to establish for example a gateway, it could be a good thing to advertise if this is legal to do in your jurisdiction.

Bitcoin's implicit trust model requires you to trust that no single entity or group manages to get more than 50%of the global mining power.

Sorry to tell you, but you are wrong. Gatehub uses the public servers instead of their own by default, Poloniex is off-chain and RCL itself can scale up to 1000+ TX/s. It is far from being under high load atm. (there would be spikes in the ledger close interval [edit: or fees] for example:

The Android issue was that the signatures in Bitcoin require a unique secret number, which typically is random. In some cases, some transactions reused the same number.

Then Wikileaks could still accept XRP donations indefinitely and most likely via Hawala-style community credit networks also in fiat (Ripple can't enforce what people choose to model on top of it). Ripple-classic after all was far more about community credit than gateways (which are more prominent in Ripple now).
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:27:05
The picture is both wrong and right at the same time...
The search space for addresses is far far smaller than 2^256
Then again it is quite easy to attack private keys if they are not using the signature algorithm properly (which ALSO requires a random number for every single signature) - this was the issue when a few dozen BTC or so were removed from blockchain.info wallets... also getting actual 256 bit of randomness is hard and there is for sure a significant amount of BTC stored with much less entropy protecting it.

A bank in my home country recently imploded (again) and destroyed several times more money than what bitcoin had at its highest capitalization ever. The bank was not very large...
Why do you think that a service that markets itself mainly towards banks would want to closely relate itself to a community that is already hostile, has no established leadership, stewardship or direction, is often associated with things that banks would not want to be associated with and that currently is so small that even a "premined" XRP token can have ~1/4th of total value (
Look, I really like Bitcoin, but reactions like the ones in this subreddit (did you even listen to the recording by the way?) really make me doubt that this is not the right choice by Mr. Larsen.
Can you please link any statement by Ripple Labs that XRP "shouldn't have value"? Since they apparently keep saying that, it shouldn't be hard to find... My understanding is that their position is that XRP are supposed to have some value (that's why they are useful as anti-spam measure). They don't seem to be involved in price setting (and they only can push it down anyways) these days.

Yes, essentially you store a list of hashes of your cleartext data + links to your encrypted data which can be used to decrypt your files again. Mega can only know what's in your files, if they also have the completely unencrypted version of the file, hash it and find out that already some people have the resulting file in their account.
This makes it also easy to e.g. remove copyrighted material (if Mega would care about that), because you could just supply a certain file and delete the resulting encrypted parts. The only way to escape from that would be to e.g. put the file in a container, add a few bits or something else that changes the file hash.
In practice files are deterministically split usually, so it gets even harder to simply flip a bit and be able to avoid deduplication (it would only affect 1 or 2 fragments).

Because if you knew all the traffic from the participants and are able to bundle addresses and transactions to wallets, this would just protect you as long as a large amount of your coinjoin "buddies" are 100% up in their game indefinitely. As soon as one makes a single mistake, he/she/it is retroactively deanonymized and you have one fewer layer of protection. Also CoinJoin only helps with offline blockchain analysis, these guys are trying to snoop as much data as possible from the P2P network apparently instead.

 (the only project where something negative about it is mentioned is Bitcoin: "trotz der jüngsten schlechten Nachrichten in Verbindung mit Bitcoin")  
 (Internet crime - Bitcoin is mentioned again with a quote from the BKA: "Denn das Internet sei *aufgrund solcher Dienste* „eine geeignete Plattform zur Vorbereitung und Begehung von Straftaten“")

Microsoft or Dell accepting Bitcoin? Not newsworthy. Amazon calling their internal Android store account balances "Amazon Coin"?

I'm not from Buttcoin, I think Ripple is different than Bitcoin (rather complimentary technology) and the censorship is in my opinion related to Bitcoin companies going down the "move fast and ask for forgiveness later" road which might work if you're building a quadcopter but no so much in the financial industry.
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:07:31


You "only" need to attack, slow down or isolate mining pools. Probably even fewer than you'd need to take down to cause harm to Ripple, looking at the hash rate distribution. Just as individual miners then can switch pools, so can people just change validators...

Banks wouldn't use them directly, they would interact with market makers via ILP and these market makers would e.g. trade on various exchanges (inside and outside RCL) against XRP.
The same scheme would work with BTC, LTC, ETH or whatever, but XRP are already ILP enabled and are much faster and cheaper to transact and confirm than for example BTC.
There is a likely future where XRP are not the main intermediate currency, at the moment it is one of the best ones out there though.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:34:03


No, you don't need to transfer XRP to transfer balances in Ripple (while you need to do so in Counterparty, as the transactions there are piggy-backing on top of actual BTC transactions).

To be honest, I would expect my friends to handle their money by themselves, not to use some mobile phone app to pool payments with no real benefit (other than using a mobile phone for this instead of cash?). Maybe this Venmo stuff is so ubiquitous in some areas/groups that it might make sense there?
If I need to pool some larger payments (rent, electricity...), I would either create an association if I need a legal person to handle the money (if it is a shared flat for example) or just tell them to set up recurring payments. For small things like the examples on your website I just would feel awkward to collect money from them, especially with a phone.
I also find these "roulette" options appalling and wonder about the usability (not all bills are split evenly... why should e.g. the designated drive who only had 1 coke pay for the 1.5 cocktails that all the others had? Now you need to check again who needs to pay what and maybe even factor in tax, tips and whatnot). It seems like it would take quite a while to pay up still, as only one phone with the app running is the central ledger, so I doubt the experience would be very nice once you get beyond a handful of people. You'd have the "accountant" fiddle with a phone and enter everyone's amounts, then it gets passed around (hopefully without complaints?), potentially someone "funny" will try to access a message app instead of sending a payment, you'd have to watch your phone while paying for the whole group at the same time all while providing great juicy data bits linking your accounts together quite strongly. All your user gets in return for that is...?
Last but not least, this is a use case that is completely independent of Bitcoin. If you got PayPal to talk to you, you could easily implement this using PayPal too, which would actually give you a much larger user base.

You store some amount of BTC in a way that it can be redeemed later. At the same time, in a different system (however that looks like - a bank, a blockchain...) you get issued some different tokens that you can use in that other system. If you want to go back to Bitcoin, you can then again store some of these different tokens away and automatically redeem Bitcoins on the blockchain, that you or someone else has stored away previously.
To prevent abuse, the storing/redemption process is done by an algorithm that you know beforehand (A simple one would be: You store 1 Bitcoin on the blockchain, you get 100 Buttcoins on the ass-chain or you store 100 Buttcoins on the ass-chain, you get back 1 Bitcoin on the blockchain).
The hope is apparently that most of these "sidechains" would build upon Bitcoin technology, which would strengthen the brand and get more developers and since the actual transactions happen someplace else (similar to what changetip does for example), the blockchain gets spammed less.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:05:10
Yeah... and then you choose to transfer money on a public(!) ledger.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:15:02
No, the algorithm is open source and well documented (how can you own an algorithm anyways?!). My guess is that you are hinting that most validators + nodes trust the Ripple Labs validators, which means whatever they do, the whole network would quickly replicate.
There is no inherent need to use only RL validators, Bitstamp for example also runs one (see  for the relevant pubkey) as do a few other gateways. Still the topology of the UNL graph between servers is likely quite centralized towards Ripple Labs I guess, partly because server operators want it that way, partly because it is the recommended setting.
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:40:07
It might be a fun exercise, it won't help the network a lot though. Maybe some people on reddit will tip you on changetip if you post a thread about it though?

No, partial payments existed from day one. Just like malleable signatures in both Bitcoin and ripple (in ripple they are usually canonicalized nowadays, I guess in Bitcoin too?).

Segwit solves some still existing malleability issues which prevent it from competing with the Ripple or Ethereum blockchains (who already have non-malleable transactions enabled). This would push BTC and the whole ecosystem around it to be able to natively adopt ILP and directly compete with XRP in Ripple's banking solution.
Also SegWit (non-)adoption makes Bitcoin look much more fragile and slow than it should be.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:55:56
That is only block traffic though, you need to add transaction traffic on top of that as well as SPV nodes requesting data from you through bloom filters (which are even designed to waste bandwidth to ensure privacy).

Validators sign the current chain all the time, it is not hard to find out if they are on the main one. I agree that the interconnections between validators are of higher importance than the P2P connections in Bitcoin, where connections between miners and pools are the weaker links (and a pool going down can even cause a chain reaction killing other pools if miners suddenly flow over and basically DDoS them).

Ripple end users don't run validators either, they typically rely on a server (or bunch of servers) that they believe to be residing on the main chain, similar to the electrum model in Bitcoin.
Network splits are a dramatic event and quite rare; I thought we were discussing extreme situations here? In normal operation it is not very likely that either Ripple or Bitcoin split, if you claim that it is easier/more likely for Ripple style consensus to break than PoW, I'd love to see a paper or something more concrete on that other than suspicions.

How do you know then that you need to create everything from scratch?!
Also, if your application is related to money, you might want to have a competent cryptographer (and likely you'll want to release your code anyways, so developing in secret isn't very useful in the first place). These people are NOT cheap and often are working already on their own projects.

1 mention of my user name.  
1 answer to my post with 0 useful content.  
1 PM by changetip, asking me to collect my "funds" (that will be stolen from me in ~~2 weeks~~ [Edit: 1 week] anyways) including a link to an "infographic" that doesn't even show with no-script enabled
and probably
1 additional PM in a few days by changetip AGAIN asking me AGAIN to collect "my" funds, since they intend to steal them away from me.
I do not want any of my posts tipped off-chain if I can't collect that tip on-chain without signing up for a service, I don't want changetip to spam my username or PM me with bots and I don't want them to leave the post I responded to up as an ad for their shitty service if I don't even get ANYTHING from them!
From the PM I got:  


You received a Bitcoin tip via In reality:


We make a best effort to deliver a tip, but it doesn't always work out. If that happens, we will refund to the tip to your account at no charge after 7 days. 
So, no - if I get tipped, I don't get *anything* at all, the bot is just claiming I received a tip. Actually, I just get the "great" offer of creating an account with them (and agreeing to their ToS + privacy policy amongst other things) to claim the few scraps I recieved in the last 7 days.
It's like handing someone a nearly expired coupon. Worth 1 cent. That you have to sign up for within 7 days to cash in including several pages of contract attached (e.g. you waive the right to sue if you are mistreated) - and oh *by the way*, they are also tracking your location data:  Which is also not protected data by any law in the US, since I'm not a citizen there.

No, it takes a while to parse and verify the downloaded blocks - bootstrapping is in most cases CPU bound. If you download via the torrent (which you should NOT do since it doesn't help at all), you have to wait for the download AND the verification while if you just start the node, it will download and verify at the same time.

Actually, it does... 
Anyways, Ripple is not mainly designed as Altcoin... The basic idea is that Bitcoin is the "ultimate cash money" and Ripple is the platform for the "ultimate book money" - these are 2 different types of money alltogether and both are needed. I kinda doubt that with the current development pace we'll see any working side chain implementation before 2020 and even then I doubt that there would be any serious adoption of that technology (depending on how it actually is implemented).
Comparing Bitcoin with ripple is like comparing cash payments and SEPA transfers. There are different goals and advantages to each.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:46:03
Sure, in the meantime also take a look around and check out how many merchants that "accept Bitcoin" actually hire centralized, closed source services whose value proposition is to sell the BTC on their behalf as fast as possible.

It means you put your opinion/voice out there - it depends on others if they are willing to listen to it. You won't automatically get on other people's UNL immediately unless there is someone who builds their UNL by adding every new validator out there.

Replace RaspberryPi with Intel NUC and you might be onto something.
I would advise against a TOR browser on such a node (just use the TOR proxy there from whatever other machine in your network) or even running a display server and the Bitcoin node probably also shouldn't have a wallet attached on the machine, but can be used as fast local trusted data source for thin/SPV clients.
Also running a full DD-WRT (or rather OpenWRT) stack with all their custom kernel modules and own packages etc. might be a bit overkill. What exactly do you want to do with such a solution? Should your Bitcoin activities also be routed through TOR for example? Do you want to offer a TOR-only hotspot?

First of all, do NOT under any circumstances write anything to these drives. If they are still connected to ANYTHING, remove that connection immediately and keep it that way. Go to sleep, don't do anything, they won't run away or spoil overnight but you'll have a much clearer state of mind the next day.
Secondly, create a complete image of them using something like dcfldd, do a backup of this image and only try any restore operations on a third copy of this image (SSDs are small anyways). Kepp the original 2 copies + the original SSDs.
Thirdly, the rest depends a lot on how that RAID was constructed in detail and e.g. if your wallet was encrypted. Worst case would be that you have to treat all data on there as potential private key and you have to basically bruteforce through it with a cutom written tool. Best case would be that you can simply mount the 2 images and read you wallet file from there because a bit flipped or something else that broke the (R)AID.

Well, what do you want to supply the network with? If you just want to be a bulk store of blockchain data, all you need is fast I/O to whereever you store the chain + a fast internet connection to serve it to whoever asks for it.
If you want to be useful in quickly forwarding current data (transactions + newly found blocks) to your peers, you need a fast CPU + RAM to verify the signatures on blocks and transactions that you're seeing for the first time. The RPi2 might not be great in that regard, but maybe still better than some crappy 10 USD/year VPS server somewhere. The crappy 10 USD/year VPS however probably has better upstream capabilities, so there might be some use in these nodes too.
All in all, just run a node if you like, but please don't think that the network would survive if everybody just ran nodes on a few RaspberryPi computers. :)

The issue I have with changetip is not tipping, it is that getting tipped still requires you to sign up with them. All they need from me is a Bitcoin address to forward tips to (maybe above a certain balance to stop dust) and that's it.

Well, Ripple has a ~10 times larger "blockchain" than Bitcoin by now and an additional ~700GB data structure to make syncing "full nodes" a matter of minutes, but yes, a very large block size could very well lead to few large servers that people can only access with SPV clients. You'd have to actually use that block size though...

@_date: 2015-02-14 00:01:00
Yeah, it's a bit convoluted in that BIP/proposal and a bit too many non-Bitcoin things in the Ripple implementation. The general idea is that a full node actually only needs a 100% trustless way to get all currently spendable transaction outputs. Currently you have to replay the whole transaction history since 2009. If it would be a network rule to construct a deterministic data structure of all unspent outputs and hash that and then embed that hash in a block (or header), all you'd need is to get a potentially valid bunch of unspent outputs, construct the data structure yourself, hash it and you'll know exactly if you are up-to-date. No need for the whole blockchain or even much older headers at that point (though in Bitcoin it might be still useful to trace your headers back to genesis because of PoW, which is not used by Ripple).
Ripple mainly operates on incrementally changing and traversing this data structure, so the ~700 GB are the history of that data structure over time. You can choose to get the full one over time or (if you don't care about history) just download the most recent couple dozen MB or so and you're already fully up to date.
@_date: 2015-02-05 09:36:37
You can take a look at Ripple's consensus, it really depends on what you want to do though.
The nice thing about proof of work is that you also can use it for decentralized distribution of native tokens.

Poisson distributions are already in a half semester course over here... not even about statistics but "only" probability theory. I wouldn't consider this stuff very advanced...
Anyways, to be more constructive: There are a LOT of very good ressources out there to watch lectures online from very prestigious places such as Harvard, Yale, MIT and others, they for sure will also have stuff about probabilities or statistics that you can learn right now 100% for free.

Satoshi also owns huge amounts of BTC, the amount of currency someone owns does only mean that person could crash the market, not that this influences the underlying system directly (indirectly you can probably bribe people etc. if you own lots of money).
Fair point if you don't like it (which is a personal choice), feature wise Ripple is ahead in a few areas, Counterparty maybe in others I guess. I have yet to see any compelling actual use of Counterparty that wouldn't be better on Ripple (a good example is Tether), then again I might not be looking hard enough.

Shitty hardware and often also shitty bandwidth... not a good combination. Also your assumption (more nodes = always better) is wrong. Actually, fewer nodes = faster transactions, since it takes fewer hops to broadcast them. The extreme case would be a single node which would instantly let all nodes (= itself) know about new transactions while if there are billions of nodes out there, it would take a huge effort to distribute a single transaction to all of them.

Whomever you're sending BTC to will also not be able to receive the USD (or EUR) outside of the typical transfer time windows of banks - selling on an exchange would only help to keep the exchange rate risk down, you still won't be able to spend money on the exchange until you received the transaction from them - which often also takes longer than a day in the first place.
Using Paypal you'd be able to spend fiat money you receive immediately by the way, no need to wait for blocks or to sell on an exchange.

Lots of people look at coinmarketcap, see "Ripple" there and assume the platform == the currency (which is true for Bitcoin and lots of other currencies listed there). They then proceed to check out what this "Ripple" is all about, find out that the currency is called "XRP" and that XRP are centrally issued and mostly still held by Ripple Labs - which of course sets off alarms left and right in this community. Also, since this is so obviously a scam, there is no further need to read about it and everything that is written about it is either written by (paid) shills, delusional fans or (worst of them all) bankers.
My guess is that the "Ripple sucks" comments here often mean "XRP suck", especially considering that the actual concepts of Ripple that get sometimes partially implemented in other platforms are heralded as "long needed decentralization".

The only part that is hard to do in that score (on the lower part of  seems to be answering block requests - and even that is just a matter of bandwidth/storage on your small nodes... e.g. maybe it is enough to veeeery slowly send valid data from a database that is central to all nodes, or to simply ask a different node on the fly for the needed data and just forward it (as MITM).

He used basic social engineering tactics ("trust me for 100 BTC to get 1 BTC for free on Ripple") to leech out good IOUs in exchange for junk IOUs. It is not clear if he did it himself or if the person funding his account did it (or if for example the person funding his account actually just posted a Ripple address belonging to TradeFortess in the giveaway thread).
Anyways, he called it "social experiment", Ripple devs claimed "working as intended" (as people had 2 trust lines to both "good" and "junk" IOU issuers without making any distinction between them using the protocol), Bitcointalk administrators and moderators were all like "it is worthless debt and no 'hard asset' anyways, so everyone is free to pull this off" and the ones who actually got their BTC stolen were probably newies or other non-famous people in bitcoinland so nobody cared about their loss anyways.

Your example is wrong in the sense that one can choose which IOUs one is willing to accept.
If I only specify that I am accepting Bitstamp issued BTC IOUs, I don't care what Zhou Tong has issued or whom he trusts/he has been trusted. Someone with Zhou Tong issued BTC IOUs first has to (automatically, this is what Ripple does) exchange them to Bitstamp issued BTC IOUs to pay me. There is no way that I'll end up with IOUs I didn't agree to.
Similar with other currencies, if I only agree to receiving gold certificates from my local broker, Ripple will either look to exchange the Zhou Tong BTC via  one or several intermediates to these certificates on its internal market or it will say that there is no path found and this transaction cannot take place.
In your example (&lt;-&gt; meaning trusting both neighbours I assume) Allan and Ben will get "Zhourippled" (or "TradeFortressed") as they trusted somebody who was dishonest. Joe will only end up with Suzi USD, as she is the only one he trusts.

It is not just BitPay that is problematic, it is their whole idea of existing - imagine for a second that BitPay might just be a honeypot to connect IP addresses to bitcoin payments... would be a perfect way to do this, right?

The "attack" is two-fold:  
You either mine fast and get 2 blocks in a row (by luck, or you'd have 51% anyways), then you announce the older one and lie waiting with your new one hidden up your sleeve. [EDIT: This is wrong, they propose to release both blocks, maybe also to rule out other people with blocks up their sleeves. It would be enough to invalidate all the work of the honest miners to release the hidden block right away unless you are really afraid of orphans, but then you could still release the second new one...]
You have a block up your sleeve at the moment and someone else in the network finds a block. Then you need to choke this other node as soon as possible and get your own block out to as many potent miners as possible while ensuring that they do NOT get the block from the other ones.  
The problem here is that on one hand you rely on having fast connections to all other miners (and they want that too) but need to make them as isolated as possible from each other to ensure that they do not get the block updates from each other but only from you!  
As they can choose their own connections, you need to either DoS them etc. or at least slowly take over their connections.
EDIT: Other miners will by default not any more use the first block, but the most difficult block that is revealed to them, so while network speed is of importance, in this scenario you need to make sure that you block other nodes announcing blocks that are not yours VERY well.

Once coins are moved, it is really hard to make any impact with them on that measurement for some time. This is designed to make sure older coins are weighed higher, so their impact on that number is greater.
Also you are mixing up "coins created" with "coins last moved". If I move a coin 100 times today that was created 100 days ago but moved yesterday to my account, I still destroy only a single bitcoin day.

In Bitcoin terms: The "transaction" root hash in the Ripple header = "blockchain", The "AccountState" root hash = UTXO tree. There are some differences, like Ripple not relying on using outputs as inputs but natively implementing the concept of accounts/addresses and a few other structures (Order books...) but in essence a signed UTXO set a a certain block height is the closest Bitcoin equivalent.

To be fair, they don't advertise it (it is the only payment option that is actually HIDDEN behind a link) and all in all at least 6344 people did pay with Bitcoin who might not have done that otherwise (I count myself amongst these...).
If the amount of money saved on transaction fees is worth the additional work in accounting and adding a payment processor will be seen. It is a nice first step, but as said, 99.35% of payments are NOT Bitcoin payments on Humblebundle.
What would be interesting would be to see the results per payment processor after each bundle and weekly sale - do more people pay with BTC? (some time ago only 729 paid with it, so 6344 would be a large improvement on that) If that is the case, there might be a reason to keep it after all, since over time one then can really save something on transaction fees.

You need 1 million USD worth of BTC to transfer 1 million USD in Bitcoin, you need less than 1 USD worth of XRP to transfer 1 million USD in Ripple.
XRP are used for reserves and fees, not for moving the actual amount, this is one of the main differences between Ripple and Bitcoin and something that seems hard to grasp for some people around here. Their market value (unless you want to speculate on them) is just not very relevant.

Looks like a Ripple network with only limited views to me...
The issue I usually have with them is that either you use them for really tiny transactions (e.g. a beer), then there is far too much work to be done until the transaction is actually in the system or you use them for reasonably large amounts (e.g. I trust my girlfriend for up to 1000 USD), then you're likely to be scammed sooner or later - maybe even by accident, if one of your debtors or your debtor's debtors gets scammed.

I would guess that the cost per MH/s goes up even more when installing a water cooled system.
Initial low prices per MH/s were one of the few reasons (besides easy availability) why GPU mining was going so strong for so long. Overclocking makes them less efficient (more electricity used per hash) though it might make them more effective (more hashes per card). Still I doubt the few MH/s you might get more when overclocking under water as compared to air would pay for a cooler that costs sometimes nearly as much as the card itself.

Why should most nodes, which are operated by clueless users at home, relay ANY transactions at all that are not originating from that user? It already is a problem that transaction relays are not rewarded in any way (and actually pay for operating a full node in HDD, traffic, RAM usage and CPU time), this makes it even worse.
There are 2 parts to this: Mining small transactions and even telling your neighbour nodes about small transactions. I have no problem with the former, but there is very low incentive to set the latter to anything below 21 million BTC. In fact, you are better off not relaying anything as you use far less ressources on your end. This creates a heavy tragedy of the commons scenario!

True, the only ones that get screwed over (e.g. by ZhouTong BTC being worthless - can we actually call them TradeFortressBTC, as this is actually happening right now?) are the ones actually asking for it - offering to exchange 2 types of IOUs. As I said, as long as you only accept IOUs that you trust (e.g. from your bank/exchange/wife) then you either cannot receive money at all (because nobody else trsuts your wife so there is no path) or you can only receive IOUs that you are willing to accept.

No, it automatically creates a transaction out of thin air that can be UP TO 25 (50) BTC to any address(es) of your choice. If you change this transaction, you are able to take less than you could or nothing at all but not more (well you could, but nobody elase would say that this block is valid - so it wouldn't end up in the blockchain).
Yes, you can take less, yes, it already happened and yes that means there will never be exactly 21 million BTC in circulation, as some of these are irreversibly unclaimed.

In Prolog you could for example state some "truths":
Beer is drinkable
Bread is not drinkable
If you are thirsty, you should drink something
Then you "ask" the program: "I am thirsty, is there something I could do?" --&gt; it then returns to you that you should drink a beer.
The thing is that you never explicitly stated in the program that beer helps against thirst, it is only implied from the (logic) statements.
In the end you describe the truths that your program should obey and then you can ask the program some questions and it searches for a way to satisfy them. It doesn't matter to you how it actually works or is optimized inside the language itself, something that might concern you a lot if you program in an explicit language ("do this, then do that and return that other thing").

To trade it for LTC or USD or EUR or Gold bars or ...
The BTC part is not where Ripple is really needed, as BTC transactions are anyways quite fast, irreversible and atomic.
Trading currencies however already works in a system that is very close to Ripple but where different IOU issuers are not allowing people to exchange these IOUs (e.g. I cannot redeem MtGox USD codes on Bitstamp, I need to manually find someone manually to trade the 2 codes. Ripple simply offers a way to automate this.)

If it is a balance in the same asset but issued by different people, then these are in the end different things in Ripple (just like USD on PayPal are not at risk if Amazon goes down and vice versa). You decide which ones and how much of them you accept via so called "trust lines".
Double spending of the same balance (e.g. I send a transaction to A and B at the same time) gets resolved by a mechanism called consensus. In essence the network consists of nodes telling their own version of the truth (which transaction is the valid one) and they believe a few nodes out of many. They will change their own opinion if the other ones they believe have a vastly different opinion (80% of the others say the payment to A was first). This way the ordering is resolved and eventually (after a few seconds of going back and forth) everyone agrees on which one is the valid transaction.

Very good answer, there are currently a number of efforts that try to build something like a distributed marketplace either directly upon Bitcoin (e.g. Mastercoin, colored coins), in seperate technology (Ripple, NXT, eMunie(?), Bitshares, OpenTransactions) or via licensing out a framework externally (e.g. "Buttercoin" exchanges).
Some of these have their own currency built in (e.g. Ripple, NXT(?), BitShares, Mastercoin and maybe eMunie), some rely on the Bitcoin block chain as infrastructure, some build their own clients and data structures, which can be close to or diffferent from bitcoin ideas. I personally would not expect that a currency that is native to a decentralized exchange would outperform Bitcoin significantly in the longer term, that's also not really the purpose of these currencies anyways. They act more often to either enable or sustain trading on these platforms and to keep paths shorter by acting as intermediate currency.
"Altcoins" which are only Bitcoin changed in a few key areas (amount of coins, algorithm used for mining, block target time...) are of relatively limited use in my opinion, on the other hand they give something to play with for people that like penny stocks and might have one or two smart ideas that could be more easily ported to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's main strength AND weakness against these (often) smaller projects is the network already using them. To even get consensus on some small things like block sizes to allow for more transactions per second there are HUGE discussions, it takes forever and three days to come to a consensus or at least a handful of solutions and even then (since most developers are not paid) it takes forever until it is integrated. Smaller, venture backed initiatives often operate and react faster to upcoming needs (e.g. Bitcoin-QT STILL does not "prune" its block chain, even though the possibility to do so was mentioned in the original white paper!). They of course also will have to slow down after a while, if they become more popular, as there are more things at stake.

I don't know how long it takes until PP transactions are not reversible any more, but for credit cards I heard it can be several months. I guess you don't want to wait THAT long until you're finally getting your BTC to spend...

Wallet files can (and should) be at least encrypted with a passphrase. Also breaking into a computer is something that's not trivial to do.
Once you have broken into a computer by the way, nearly any current security system used to handle money on computers can be circumvented. There are only very few forms of money that are handled by computers (in the sense of PCs and Smartphones) by the way, most of the time the actual money handling is done by a service operated by either your bank or another service provider (credit card company) and all you do is to authenticate yourself to these services to make them do transfers on your behalf.

There is no difference between issuing trust on Ripple to some random person and saying "I would accept a check in currency ___ of an amount up to ___ from you!".
If you do that in "real life" you probably won't stay very long in business either. I'm trying to explain this so there are fewer noobs out there while others (e.g. TradeFortress) chose some more radical approaches, such as actually writing bad checks and handing them out as freebies on the street, then claiming that there's something wrong with the whole banking system since he was able to write them and hand them out.

They cannot issue more XRP once there are more servers out there. It's currently just in the same state as Bitcoin when only Satoshi was mining - he could have easily mined another genesis block and put that in the code or issue himself some "bonus". Once the system got distributed and others joined in, it was kinda set in stone.
Currently the Ripple Devs claim that they still do changes to the code every week that would require network-wide consensus ("hard fork" in Bitcoin terms) so they decided to keep the network closed for the moment. As there is nothing to gain from running your own server anyways and XRP can't be mined, the only complaint I usually hear from Ripple detractors is "I don't get a beefy bonus as early adopter!".
OpenCoin would get into a lot of trouble probably if they suddenly still decided to issue more and more XRP unannounced and once they allow 3rd party servers, the rules of the network (which include the fees and amount of XRP created) are no longer under their control because they would just create a fork that might not end up being the majorly supported one probably.

1) check out the scalability article on the Bitcoin wiki
2) This si something a lot of miners do believe, in practice difficulty (and thus mining power and expenses) does FOLLOW price. Just think of it that way - would people switch on or buy miners if the price rises, or would you buy more BTC because someone switched on or bought a miner?  
That aside, Bitcoin (like most other currencies) do have 0(!) value! The price they are traded for depends on their utility, there is little to no actual value in a database entry.
3) For example making purchases because they are not allowed or able to operate a bank account. I would guess there are a lot of speculators though.
4) You cannot require someone to make backups on a medium that can not be verified by a computer. Anyways, people loose data that is worth far more than a few BTC all the time due to not having backups - why do you have none?!
5) Well, feel free to share these ideas, however: It is easy to design a chargeback-enabled solution upon a non-chargeback platform, it is impossible to do it the other way round. Good to see that people are still slowly realizing that even if something can be used without requiring trust, you still need trust if you want to get something other than what's part of this system.

Ripple is exactly like BitPay - you can receive currency you like (e.g. USD) while someone else sends currency they like (e.g. Bitcoins) and conversion happens at market rates.
Your main argument against it seems to be that only few people use it...? At least a few thousand people do use it, I'd estimate the community to be around the size of the "donkdown" forums currently.
Anyways, it works similar to the banking system - you deposit something (e.g. USD) at a location you trust and get a balance on Ripple in return, that you can use to transact with and trade with. After some time, to get back your money (and eventual profits) you'd go back to your gateway, send back the balance and receive the USD or whatever else they promised to hold for you. The whole idea is that you do NOT need to physically move cash (except for cashing in/out of the system of course).
Bitstamp is also a Bitcoin exchange, that's correct - however using USD.Bitstamp you can also buy CNY on Ripple, or Litecoins... Also there are "pure" gateways, like DividendRippler that only focus on issuing and redeeming currency and letting people trade them on their own. Gateway != exchange, the exchange itself happens on Ripple.
XRP have not much to do with all of this, they are on one hand used to limit spam and are on the other hand the only native asset on Ripple, so they could/should work as "path shortener" in case a trade involves several steps (e.g. you trade USD for gold, gold for Euros and then Euros for Yen vs. you trade USD for XRP and then XRP for Yen). A trade can involve them but doesn't have to. Also they work as basic fee, at least 10 µXRP (aka. "drop") get destroyed as fee for each transaction.

He might find the case of weak random number generators on Android phones that made a few people leak their private keys by signing with the same "random" number interesting, if he is into EC crypto...
After all the block chain is a collection of over 60 million signatures, might be that there is something interesting to uncover, data anlysis wise, just like people collecting primes used in RSA.
The borders between currency and asset are not very defined and this is probably more a debate for economists anyways.

XRP (not Ripple) are an asset, the only one in the Ripple ecosystem. It is clear they want to use them as such and want them to increase in value. On their own however they are worthless but useful (just like BTC) so they might have some value.
There is no need to be invested in XRP on Ripple at all and whoever is, will be likely better off in the near future in investing in other currencies or assets.
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:07:53
That's why you could choose to hold a balance of BTC isntead on Ripple. You only need a nearly worthless amount of XRP ever, after that Ripple is similar to a web wallet (with the risk that the wallet provider - your gateway - can make a run for it and the benefit that you can use your balance anywhere you can find a market for these BTC you deposited). I wouldn't put my life savings in BTC on Ripple, but in case it really takes off this means I could shop anywhere Ripple is accepted in BTC, even if the shop itself doesn't use or even know about BTC.
The goal of Ripple is to be a great transfer mechanism for value, the goal of BTC is to be a great store of value.

1. "A dollar owed by John" can only occur if you trust John to hold at elast 1 USD for you. If you do that, that's your own business. I personally only trust gateways in currencies (e.g. BTC) that I can easily and cheaply withdraw. Also "a dollar in your pocket" is nearly the only way you can actually own USD, if you pay via credit card or have money on your bank account or get a check, you carry IOUs. Think of ot this way: whenever you send BTC, all you can get back is another amount of BTC or a certain amout of IOUs. These might be redeemed quickly or slowly, depending on what you spent the BTC on, but still most of the time you'll still create and redeem IOUs already when using BTC.
2. True, like most web services and web sites (amongst them a LOT of Bitcoin businesses, most bitcoin transactions probably are processed by closed source scripts). Unlike MtGox, Satoshi's Dice or MPOE they actually want to release the code. I personally also won't invest lots of time and effort (also because the public server is quite lame) until this happens and lot of thers too, so there is anyways some pressure already on OpenCoin to fix their bugs, implement the features they want and then go public. Just releasing without a code audit however might not be too smart after running "live" already, since a bug might cost people money.
3. Compared to the fed there is no oil that is sold natively in XRP (yet?). I see the lacking deployment plan however also as one of the bigger issues. Bitcoin got around this by handing free money to people who could proof they wasted energy and did useless work. Not ideal by far, but still better than other ideas. Bitcoin was however designed to just be distributed to the masses for free and then (maybe because it was difficult to get them or because they are useful for that) they might eventually be used as money. Ripple (not XRP) is rather designed for something else. Having XRP however distributed in the current way also makes me wonder how the hell they plan to do it after going live - currently we're still in closed beta, so of course it's ok to tease a bit and spend a few millions here and there for free. Soon(TM) it will become necessary though to get a starter amount of XRP via PayPal or Credit card if they want to reach the masses.

Actually he explained it quite badly, if a page like this were made for Bitcoins, it would read similarly (effectively pre-mined by Satoshi and made artificially difficult to know about by posting a Windows only(!) client out of the blue to a cryptoanarchist mailing list, strage giveaway scheme that rewards early adopters extremely well compared to latecomers, unbacked, deflationary, slow, unknown how expensive it'll get in the future even though marketed as "free" or "low fee"... you know the drill).
Most of the stuff on that page is at most half true, and it is presented in a way that is of course (after all he tries to make it look like a scam) one sided.
Feel free to decide it is a scam (as probably a lot of people that hear about Bitcoin think it is a scam) if you like, I personally still am convinced it is not, especially not for the reasons that are listed on that page.

Reddit is not a person and even groups of people can be wrong - just look at inputs.io! 2 weeks ago if you dared to say anything against TradeFortress' great secure web wallet service, you would have incited a flamewar how you dare to say something against this great guy. After the "hack" got public suddenly everybody was suspicious from the beginning, boycotting this sketchy site from day one and always knew that TF was a dirty little scammer.
The same happened a bit more than 1 year ago with a guy under the nick "pirateat40" on the bitcointalk forums. Highly trusted, handed out cash like crazy and handled 6 or 7 digit amounts of BTC always delivering perfectly on time - great trust rating on the Bitcoin web of trust page and always with a witty remark on his lips on the forums.
If MtGox, Bitstamp or whatever other exchange declares bankruptcy tomorrow, you'll have the exactly same situation.
You can build a list of exchanges Reddit user use, trust or know - but it won't be really possible to establish from this if they are really trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-05-21 14:20:38
Yes, it is of value (just as EUR, LTC or USD have value) in the sense of **usefulness**. Not in the sense of "I can eat it if I'm hungry", but in the sense of "probably tomorrow I can exchange this still in some way that I can get something to eat when I'm hungry".
Bitcoins are VERY useful in my opinion to become the next evolutionary step in "money" (that's why I own and will continue to own quite a few of them) - still they have 0 value in the sense of being useful beyond being ledger entries, however interpreted (colored coin, bitcoin...).
Again: Every atomic transaction you can take within Bitcoin will let you end up with either an IOU from someone outside of the system or something that has also 0 value (another Bitcoin). One of the bigger problems that Bitcoin is also not really designed to solve (maybe via colored coins?) is actual trading. Trading however will always be based on debt, even if it is for very short times or small amounts to minimize risks.
As soon as you do any transaction that involves something else than exchanging 1 BTC for another amount of BTC, you are creating/destroying IOUs. Ripple only makes this process visible (maybe one reason why some Bitcoiners seem to suddenly be so appalled by that idea, since it makes them realize that they actually are using this kind of system already and now a company(!) dares to formalize this) and adds some nice features like actual trading and decentralized automated exchanges of IOUs, features that are as needed in the IOU part of trades as is the "send X BTC to any address in the world safely within 6 confirmations" for the ownership part that Bitcoin is so great in.
While I would agree that Bitcoin is currently the ultimately useful type of money available at the moment, I would also claim that Ripple is very close to being the ultimately useful way to trade IOUs.
I personally see no way beyond barter trades in person to exchange actual value between two parties - only IOUs (= "I promise to give you one cow for this contract") or - beyond that - exchange of things that have 0 value but are widely accepted for things of value (= "I give you 5000 USD for this cow" or now: "I give you 40 BTC for this cow"). What's new now is that Ripple takes one step back from this monetary evolution and lets people (potentially) even trade cow IOUs for chicken IOUs. It can (and most likely will for the largest part) also handle money IOUs though.

No, Bitcoin means you own a private key and coins are sent there without any other party involved.
If BitPay decides for whatever reason that they don't like you, they can freeze your account or funds, make a run with the money or do anything they want, since the coins are paid to them and you only get a balance with them which is cleared once a day.
Paypal also deals with "real" USD, that does not mean that they won't freeze your account if you dare to buy a botte of cuban rum.

Number 2 is likely the issue here, as your client would run the script to evaluate its validity.

Bitcoin as released initially by Satoshi is not even the main protocol any more, you can NOT run a 0.1.0 node on the current block chain.

Apparently you just need a partner that sends you USD, it wouldn't really matter if your customers pay in BTC, LTC, bars of gold, sea shells or gallons of oil as long as there is a trustworthy partner that can consistently convert these things at a fair price to USD and send you these.

XRP != Ripple.
Also I didn't talk about creation (XRP are pre-allocated, there is no mining in Ripple alltogether by the way), I talked about acquisition and trading. Without trade you'd have no idea what BTC are worth and you wouldn't be able to use them at all (as you cannot do anything besides maybe timestamping hashes with them on the block chain). Trade volume of BTC is FAR larger than transaction volume and trading takes place off-blockchain with redeemable tokens.

For some time the idea was to register the XBT symbol with SIX interbank (who is in charge of the ISO standard for currency codes) and equal XBT = 1 µBTC. This way existing software could use the full precision of current Bitcoin transactions (0.01 XBT = 1 Satoshi), there is no confusion between BTC and XBT (1 BTC = 1 million XBT) and also prices would look more appealing to people who are not that familiar with SI prefixes.

Oh, but wait, bitcoin users surely paid WAY more than those greedy litte PayPal users, so it might be worth something to accept this obviously unpopular currency, even if only few people pay - to attract those BTC high rollers!




30226.950000000001/4632466.3758650003*100 = ~ 0.65% AGAIN. Sorry, this is the reality. Even to a highly technology aware public, less than 1% are willing to pay with Bitcoin and rather hand their credit card information to Google, Amazon, PayPal or elsewhere. They also don't spend more on average.

Then again at the shitty exchange rates that BitPay offers they don't need a fee to get a profit.
Also no fees is just because miners gt paid 25 BTC/block additional to the existing fees at the moment.

If I quickly ned to liquidate BTC, I anyways can already do so either on centralized (e.g. Bitstamp) or decentralized (e.g. Ripple) exchanges.
Adding a broker as intermediate would just cost more but have litte advantages in my opinion, the only merit that I can see is (as you said) that banks might see it as more useful for collateral if they know they can seize funds if necessary. It is however possible to prove that you hold a certain amount of bitcoins by signing a message with the private key of the address that holds them, so unless you have some crazy good connections to banks that magically makes them love your fund but still hate the underlying asset (BTC) I don't really see the use case, sorry.

...like Bitstamp or Kraken? Also he doesn't seem to get that Ripple != XRP ("ripples"). Ripple is mainly a payment network and distributed exchange, not a currency. It is easy to trade BTC for USD and CNY at least on there, the ILS and LTC markets are also kinda ok, as are the CNY markets. For an exchange that exists for ~1 year now, the volume is also about what you'd expect.
Just mentioning Ripple and Litecoin in the same sentence is just showing that he probably didn't get it (after all he admits it in this very article). Ripple is much more like BitPay than Litecoin.

Well, for once compared to 2 years ago, miners choose the block based on it's PoW nowadays, not on the time it reached them. This makes the chance to orphan a block a bit more random (as you can only orphan a block that has PoW that is larger than the min. difficulty required and smaller than the difficulty of your block) and the choice of other miners more deterministic than "Oh, I heard of this one first, let's ignore everything else!".
You cannot know when blocks are actually popping up unless you find the winning nonce. Also time stamps on blocks cannot be 100% accurate and are allowed to vary I think for +/- 1 hour from what you think is "now".  
Anyways, as one of the premises (miners choose the block they mine based on timing - modeled by the researchers as being a 50:50 random chance afair, which I also don't agree with) is already wrong, I am not too sure this attack is even possible theoretically.

You too confuse Ripple with XRP. There is no need for mining (which is possible for the current giveaway by the way using the World Community Grid...) as XRP are not intended to be an asset that is widely dispersed (and arguably Bitcoin is neither).
The main use of Ripple imho is as decentralized exchange and market, not as decentralized wealth distributor.
It's gone funnily enough in quite a few aspects exactly the other direction of BTC - the "blockchain" (ledger in Ripple) is fully pruned all the time instead of being built from genesis, the network consisted of IOUs only before now an asset (XRP) was introduced while Bitcoin has Mastercoin/colored coin creeing up as IOUs only recently, Ripple tries to represent as many asset classes as possble while Bitcoin tries to make sure every transaction is only consisting of Bitcoins...
By the way: Bitcoiners seem to measure their wealth in USD and trade huge volumes of IOUs on centralized exchanges that they trust and mine in centralized pools with ASICs from a handful of manufacturers - also rarely receiving Bitcoins (and receiving "withdrawable balances" by that pool instead), the nearly only thing decentralized about it is the p2p network. Even there blockchain.info seems at least to have a relatively large amount of connections compared to standard clients thus putting itself at a quite central point...

Would be interesting to have this a bit more general (e.g let users select keywords to search for) and also count commits or other metrics - as far as I understand it, this just says that many repositories are created, that have the word "bitcoin" somewhere in their name or description, not that they are more active, have more developers contributing to them or anything else.

Yes, you can kinda view it as a general "online wallet" for different assets. The person holding these assets is the "gateway" and the balance you have on Ripple is representing the amount of assets you would receive back from this person (or company).
This is just like depositing USD at MtGox and receiving a USD balance from them with which you can then trade on their platform or paying USD to your PayPal account that then show up as balance you can send and pay with.
This also means that if MtGox (or PayPal's vault) is hacked and money is stolen, your USD are gone, while the balance might still be there, like in any system where you deposit funds elsewhere, you give up control over them to gain convenience or services (trading, sending balances to others that might redeem them instead...).

There probably very quickly will be some Ripple forks that try to remove XRP out of the system, as a lot of criticism is based around this. The major issue with a lot of distributed monetary systems is spam prevention though. XRP serve this purpose by being on one hand a proof of stake mechanism (you need to have a minimum amount in your account) and by being used as token when sending transactions.
There might be other ways of making sure that there is no/little spam (e.g. proof of work, like in bitcoin or network wide enforced fees, like in Visa/Mastercard/Paypal). OpenCoin chose the option that made most sense for them while staying as decentralized as possible (network wide fees for example lead to a LOT of centralization).
As the OpenCoin implementation is probably the most developed one and the one with the highest initial acceptance (as well as marketing budgets, ability to offer consultancy...) there is a good chance that there will be a similar situation to the current one with Bitcoin and *coin where a few altcoins have interesting concepts but a lot are mostly get-rich-quick schemes that change a handful of parameters and have no competent developers to even fix basic issues - basically just forks of bitcoin-qt. OpenCoin Ripple likely will be as threatened by "No-XRP" Ripple as Bitcoin is by Litecoin, Feathercoin, BBQcoin, Beercoin, ...coin.

My point is that you are looking for a trusted payment provider (in this case: BitPay) to hand you USD and you don't actually care what this payment provider takes in return for your customers as long as you get the proper amount of USD. This could be BTC but really anything else too. WU and PP are just examples for already established ones. You might of course care in the end that also your customers are relatively fine with the choice of payment provider (after all they likely have to pay a more or less hefty price on top for fees or conversion rates).
BitPay and Coinbase also often have quite strange conversion rates that a customer has to obey by the way... since I usually only buy items in single digit dollar amounts, I don't really care that much if their prices are a few % over the market, once you get up to prices like your wares (whatever they are) spot prices actually start to matter - and BitPay + Coinbase have their monopoly there on conversion rates for your customers.

Ripple != XRP, Ripple is a decentralized exchange, XRP ("Ripples") are only used to shorten path lengths and as a Proof-of-Stake kind of mechanism when creating addresses.

It's a bit similar to the Finney attack...
All in all you withhold valid solutions either until you found the next block as well or until you are afraid that it might be orphaned (so the latest point in time to show your block would be as soon as you learn from another node that it knows a new block).
I am not too sure if it really would be benefitial to pull this off for the pool (would be great to see their simulations, including code!) - you offset the reward for increasing the other pool's orphan rates by having a higher orphan rate yourself too.
If you act like blockchain.info and connect to LOTS of clients out there (ideally even trying to dominate the network by isolating miners to make other people's blocks propagate slower) you might have a positive outlook though you might have a hard time with the few % more that you earn that way to offset your costs for dominating the network.

The weakest points are the exchanges most likely, as they won't really work without bank accounts. After all Bitcoin trading happens underground and in cash only (severely crashing the price and also making it damn hard to even KNOW the price!) difficulty will plummet, as it is not economical any more to mine at these margins. Even more people sell their coins to at least get a fraction of what their miner cost them back.
Alternatively take a good look at the current implementation - older version clients on the net have known vulnerabilities anyways (and they are a nice large portion of the network), new ones might require a 0-day attack or just exploiting a weakness in the algorithms (for example saturating the 120 connections a client by default creates with your own nodes - sybil attacks are hard to detect and easier to execute than you think). Also "whale phishing" against pools (where it might be anyways just enough to go with a national security letter to the hosting provider or hacking their server with 0-day attacks that they have aplenty, see Stuxnet) could drive them very quickly out of business.
Attacking the centralized parts or hubs in Bitcoin might be quite easy and requires maybe even just a few strongly worded letters. Can you imagine the crash once "bitcoincharts.com", pools and major exchanges show an FBI domain seizure alert all on the same day and then no blocks are relayed for 48 hours? Or what would happen if the 5 largest exchanges get hacked at the same day?
Yes, Bitcoin as a network would and could carry on. Since their _value_ is determined by trust however, this is the main attack surface.

Paper can be laminated or you could print on plastic sheets that are waterproof.
"Backdorr proof" is also a difficult claim. I can NOT trust the software you run, but I can have a look at the source code and eventually trust it. Open Source itself does not mean somethign has no backdoors or weaknesses, only that they would be very visible after they were discovered.
Paper wallets can be encrypted too, by the way. They can also not be infected by malware/software...
"Disaster recovery" of TREZOR seems also to be just a backup after all, only in a different format - and you can "backup" paper wallets on paper too.
Paper wallets likely use an external RNG when generating the address, but not transactions (as they are not capable of doing that).
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:14:01
Matercoin and colored (bit)coins can exist on the block chain, OpenTransactions can use blinded BTC and Ripple can work with Bitcoin gateways...
All of these platforms have in common, that you need to deposit your funds at a third party, who issues then a balance on the platform in one way or another. Basically you have something like a web hosted wallet, that can represent not only BTC but also USD (if you have licenses for that hopefully) and then people can use these balances for trading and later redeem these balances for the real thing again.
Any point that touches fiat will have to be licensed and wil likely be subject to AML KYC etc. laws, there is no known way around it so far (other than just breaking/ignoring these laws - a not very sustainable approach).
@_date: 2013-10-13 12:38:15
Yes and no.
If all current Bitcoin exchanges were also Ripple gateways, you could take your USD.MtGox and trade them for USD.Bitstamp for example, so you could easily withdraw from them instead of Gox. Ripple is similar to Bitinstant in this regard.
BUT:  
Even though the effects wouldn't be as crazy as currently (with still having a 10+$ price difference between Gox and others after weeks!), you would likely not get 1 USD from Bitstamp for 1 USD from MtGox in a trade, as the USD on MtGox are currently worth less - not worthless, but worth less than ones you can easily withdraw and not "eventually maybe".

Not really, that depends on your definition of "centralized" though. The most centralized part at the moment is the fact that most people use RippleLabs' validators instead of deploying their own, also a lot of people confuse Ripple (the payment system) with "ripples" or XRP (the native currency/asset on Ripple). The latter were issued to one single entity, unlike bitcoins (which are the only thing that can be transacted on the Bitcoin network) they are not the main reason Ripple exists.

You control the process at a cost: ~0.5% fees twice + about 1 hour of waiting time. As Ripple transactions are atomic, yes, there is a high chance that someone will take your MtGoxUSD and immediately hand you BitstampUSD in exchange. If that isn't the case, Ripple automatically searches further and is able to do the same exchange (e.g. MtGoxUSD --&gt; MtGoxBTC --&gt; BitstampBTC --&gt; BitstampUSD) that you proposed as well if there is only someone exchanging BitstampBTC and MtGoxBTC, no USD.
With Ripple you actually do NOT have to have a trust network, all you need to do is to trust a single gateway for a single currency and all you will ever see and receive is that currency from that gateway and all you ever need to own/buy is an amount of XRP that is equal to a cup of coffee at current prices. Everything else (currency conversions etc.) is handled by the network.

I don't really believe that the average bid would come even close to 1 BTC, let alone 10 BTC. You have an error in your calculation, because with a winning bid of 1.25 you'd only win and get back the 1 BTC, not 2.245.
Also I take 0.005 BTC, not 0.005%.
The reward is depending on other participants, but the BTC is already there (without the need for any further backing), so the game is backed which you can verify via the block chain. Currently a bet of just 0.01 BTC would win it. If you have issues with trusting me with something worth ~27 US cents atm. which would also ruin my reputation (if I have any?) if I ran away with it and earn me a scammer tag, well that's your thing. Even the bitcointipbot around here usually spits out more coin than that... I'm personally not willing to give out 10 BTC or even more just for this experiment that might very well end up with me loosing a big part of the BTC put in the pot, so if this already is too risky for you, then I guess you're just not the target audience for this stuff anyways.
The goal for me as operator is to get as many bids (fees) as possible as well as a high winning bid. To encourage that, users on one hand only have a fixed fee, not a percentage based one (want to mess up averages late in the game? Bid 500 BTC, it costs the same as bidding 0.01!), on the other hand through the 125% thingie they are incentivized to bid higher than existing bids or bid often on low amounts (=pay the operator) to get the average down. The goal for the user is to be able to bid as low as possible and still have a chance of winning. Also transparency never hurts, so the user is able to verify everything until the end.
There are also still some potential issues, but I'd love to have them pointed out by other people. :)

So you have the possibility of getting an MtGox (or similar exchange) API key that is worth probably about a day's worth of purchases with one of these "ATMs" (maybe a bit more, depending on price spikes or less, if funding accounts can be done quickly and automated) if you crack one of these open?

Not being able to trade any liquid exchange (if you are relying on MtGox, you're gonna have a bad time!) during a price swing could be such a scenario. Also being sued or somebody executing a double spend attack or some other attack on BitPay is (while highly unlikely) not 100% impossible.

User feeds 1000 USD to the machine, operator says "sorry, not enough funds available", user is pissed and has to go back to the kiosk and redeem the money.
Later user sends 1 BTC to operator, wants to withdraw the 300 USD, kiosk says "not enough funds available" - user is screwed since the price is now 500 USD and operator doesn't want to buy + hand back the 1 BTC.

Because in the time it takes to get your BTC from MtGox to Bitstamp (~1 hour), you get a (most likely more) different amount of USD at Bitstamp than if you traded 1 MtGox USD for 0.999 Bitstamp USD.
Also you pay trading fees to buy BTC at MtGox and then trading fees to sell BTC at Bitstamp.
I can offer the same service (well, MtGox doesn't give out USD credits any more, but I guess you can understand what I mean) manually on the forums or automated in Ripple. Maybe you don't see the benefits for that, but at least I hope that you can see the use case of it, especially when thinking of providing liquidity and decentralizing exchanges.

According to the standard you cited, currencies have a 3(!) letter abbreviation. As Bitcoin does not belong to a country (BTC would be Bhutan-C...), it would need to start with X.
There currently is the suggestion to have uBTC standardized as XBT, since then you would have 0.01 XBT as atomic unit (currently called "Satoshi") and no smaller fractions possible with the current code base. As most financial software expects currencies to have only 2 places after the decimal seperator, this would be important for them.
Problem is, this list is "guarded" by SIX interbank and they seem fairly reluctant to include random community projects in their list of currencies.

There are a few other altcoins that at least sound interesting (not really sure about what will happen with them in the end, also some issues usually since a lot of them are one man shows), all 3 of them intended to work more like market making currencies for decentralized markets, kinda like Ripple's XRP:
**eMunie** - custom coded client, includes messaging and a rating system. Will remain closed source for some time to make sure it is not forked right away.
**BitShares** (currently ProtoShares) - different PoW, as far as I understood it it should work more like an options market of virtual assets and somehow these will be magically pegged to real world assets. Didn't look too much into it though.
And then there's:  
**Mastercoin** - a protocol using the bitcoin blockchain as infrastructure for their own transactions, on one hand leeching from its success, on the other hand a admittedly smart move to gain initial funding (you could buy them from a centralized emitter, from that money the actual development of the protocol is being funded). might disturb bitcoin a bit and has its own problems, still at least an interesting concept and makes me wonder how bipolar the bitcoin community really can react.
I generally find "altcoins" that code their own client more interesting, a lot of the other ones are "bitcoin with parameters X, Y and Z changed" - which is fine if you think they are really THAT important, but which has very limited usability or merit for cryptocurrencies as a whole.

Some reasons I can think of:
* It is difficult to understand, since it is a distributed payment network, not "just" a distributed currency.
* RippleLabs opened the source code for the server component in the end of September but ran the network already for ~10 months by then, while granting access to server sources only to people that explicitly asked for it.
* The page "ripplescam.org", operated by TradeFortress (the guy that messed up inputs.io) was started in my opinion as preperation for his service (Ripple would be a direct competitor to any webwallet service). He was also paying up to 5 BTC to people that would put it in their signature, write negative articles about Ripple etc. - additionally he scammed some Ripple users out of BTC they owned on the platform eithout real consequence, since according to theymos (bitcointalk admin) Ripple IOUs don't mean that they are backed by anything.
* RippleLabs started out by a few bitcoin enthusiats and tried to market their product to bitcoiners as early adopter crowd - this kinda backfired, as it seems that a lots of people only seem to understand the native currency (XRP) and also don't like the idea that a balance on Ripple would be actually debt from a gateway. Even though this is nothing different from depositiong BTC and USD at an exchange (and much more centralized there), the "money = debt = fail!!!" argumnet comes up very often.
* Potentially Ripple might make it TOO easy to transact in any currency, so people might not need BTC as "world currency" any more (I personaly don't think so).
Edit: a typical example of someone hating on Ripple with a copy-paste text block can be found in this very thread:

100 billion XRP / 21 million BTC --&gt; holding ~4760 XRP means you hold the same portion of the total amount as holding 1 out of the 21 million BTC.
I got a few 10 thousand XRPs from giveaways and current ones still are usually in the lower 4-digits. Atm. you can also contribute CPU time to the World Community Grid and redeem this as XRP, if you want to "mine". Pays off a LOT more than mining any other cryptocoin at the moment by the way. ;)
As a comparison: I first got ~0.05 BTC from the faucet when I started with Bitcoin, which was worth next to nothing. What I got in Ripple giveaways alone can be converted right now to several BTC. I personally don't call that insignificant.

How do you associate blocks to pools? Relying on their statistics? Reading block headers? Network analysis?
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:48:50
Yes, though that (XRP being more successful than XBT) wouldn't really bother Bitcoin anyways I guess - Bitcoin has its own merits and Ripple is more like (to use the stupid Litecoin catchphrase) "The gold marketplace to Bitcoin's gold".
The credit/IOU structures are used in Bitcoin as soon as they are traded, if you look at exchange volume vs. transaction volume thre are probably far more transactions actually happening in Bitcoin IOUs than in real Bitcoin itself. Also even the value of "Bitcoins" quoted so often in this subreddit is actuially the price people pay for Bitcoin IOUs on certain exchanges (and this can vary quite a bit based on counterparty risks, as you can see by the gap between MtGox and others). Ripple wording this more explicit might make a few people more uncomfortable, int he end it is a concept that already exists for years and that is far too centralized in bitcoinland. Also it is needed, as there are only very few ways to transact USDs in a no-chargeback kinda fashion (ask Tradehill about their "no chargebacks, don't worry!" experience with Dwolla).

If I hold your security however, I am merely tracking the current bitcoin prices, nothing more... wouldn't this "security" raise all kinds of red flags as soon as the bank takes a look at its volatility?

I only need to ensure that "the government" does not seize &gt;80% of these at once, I can do that by for example choosing validators that are operated in different jurisdictions and/or by different organizations.
It is currently recommended to use the ones supplied by RippleLabs (as there are some features still under development that might require what would be a hard fork in Bitcoinland), there is nobody stopping me from using others as well though.
Also, while you can start your own Ripple network (just as you can start your own Bitcoin block chain), anyone not using the OpenCoin/RippleLabs ledger would not be able to directly transact with the main ledger, the same case as with Bitcoin nodes not running on the Satoshi block chain. There is nothing stopping you to do that, other than network effects.

1. Ripple solves different problems than confirmation times. It would still work with the slow transaction times of Bitcoin.
2. True that, let's wait and see.
3. It is not, only the distribution of XRP is centralized to them, not the network itself.
4. Most likely gateways will NOT lend you money or if they do they will use similar precautions as banks do. Accepting any IOU on Ripple means you tell the network "I accept up to __ IOUs in currency ___ from gateway ___", not that a gateway has to trust you or give you credit. This is the same as every Bitcoin exchange or other company already works right now.
5. XRP are used as proof of stake (you have to have a certain reserve), spam protection (XRP are destroyed on creatign transactions) and as system inherent money to allow for easier exchange pathways (JohnDoeUSD &lt;--&gt; XRP &lt;--&gt; BitstampBTC instead of more complex paths). Similar to BTC in the block chain they are actually owned by the private key holders, but have no inherent value besides their utility as money.
6. You don't need to become an exchange any more (unsure legislation), just an e-money issuer (already exisiting legislation) - and users can then exchange whatever you issued (USD, EUR, BTC, LTC...) between each other as they wish.

Well, feel free to code it then!
I don't doubt that it might be possible (take a look at Tahoe-LAFS for example). I do doubt however that anyone able to do this is also able to provide a good UX (again, take a look at Tahoe-LAFS). Once you have such a client it would be easy to include ANY hoster as backend, so unless you manage to beat everyone else out there in prices, you can't sell hosting services. Your client has to be Open Source and therefor most likely free of charge anyways.
Also sharing keys with another user that is ideally identified not via an account on your centralized service is not as easy as it may sound. BittorrenSync tries to leverage their DHT for that, similar to Retroshare for example.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:49:45
They don't pay the postage fee (just like BitPay does not pay your transaction fee) and there can't be chargebacks in cash transactions either - only refunds.

Would it be possible to use a real bitcoind as backend instead of blockchain.info? Ideally even just any cryptocoind that has similar/same RPC calls as bitcoind...
Here you can be easily fooled by blockchain.info to believe anything they tell you about the current state of the network and it seems like you don't even verify the signatures of the transactions you get from their API... which you use without SSL.

Ripple != XRP.
Nearly nobody on Ripple except a few gambling pages accepts XRP anyways, the major gateways surely don't. Also Ripple Labs does not control the supply (which is fixed), only the distribution of XRP.

Well, compared to a lot of other "premined" coins they really did a lot more (like actually creating a working distributed marketplace) - but interestingly they got far more hating for that than I've ever seen in my 3 years in the Bitcoin community.
Especially TradeFortess seems to have gone on a personal witch hunt before annoucing his own pre-mined coin (called "Bitcoin" and issued on inputs.io... ;-) ). Just take a look in this thread - upvotes left and right for posts that say little more than "Ripple = scam" without giving any reason. At the same time you usually have to convince anyone that hears about Bitcoin the first time that it is not a scam either, so the double standard is kinda weird to me - especially considering that BTC are traded nearly exclusively (by volume) as IOUs/balances on centralized exchanges against fiat currencies.

I'd guess firstbits squatters. Around that time the idea that the first unique characters of an address that has already been seen by the block chain could be enough and be used to significantly shorten addresses got popular.
Since you can generate addresses with vanitygen and then maybe even mine blocks with 1 satoshi transactions by yourself for free I guess that if you take a deeper look at these transactions they probably come from only a few coins owned by a single person.

Same as happens to your "USD" (or BTC) now at the MtGox accounts: They will not (or only partially?) be redeemable, just like a bad check. Similar situation is with bitcoinica atm.
To clear them from your account, you can probably send them to a "trashbin" address or maybe hide them or somwthing - or maybe someone believes they will pay out 1 cent for each dollar in the future and offers to buy the debt at 0.5 cent per dollar? I think it is still possible to buy bitcoinica, pirateat40 and other debt on the forums - if you ask for it, there are probably people willing to sell you this...

Google Ventures is not Google itself, check out their homepage. They also back Buttercoin, a kinda "franchise" Bitcoin exchage by the way.
XRP are only a small and relativiely insignificant part of Ripple, you could describe Ripple itself more like "generalized webwallet" (meaning you can store USD, BTC, EUR, Gold... at a gateway and get a balance on Ripple for that or redeem a balance of any of these with the gateways and receive the money back). This already highlights counterparty risk, the reward is that you can transact and trade e.g. USD in a irrevocable way within seconds.

The price and value comes purely from the free market - if there are people who want to buy at 100 USD and others who want to sell at 100 USD, this is the current price for 1 BTC.
Bitcoins don't have an inherent value (in the sense that you can survive longer if you own 1 BTC on a deserted island while 10 liters of fresh water would help you significatly more). They have a certain usefulness though and that's why people want to actually own them and accept them in trades (for USD, EUR, carrots or Reddit Gold). This is the same by the way with all other major currencies - besides heating value when burning bank notes, they are only usefule, because they are quite widely accepted and it is very likely that they will be accepted in a week from now as well.

Here lies the main issue:


With taking Bitcoin, you ARE in fact informed about all these things. The only problem is that you don't know for sure what the payment was for, but in the end you can research the whole history of every last Satoshi in existence. The whole system of Bitcoin builds upon that. It is not "apparently absurd" in bitcoinland, it's a necessity for the whole system to work in the first place.

I total Ripple sounds like an awesome debt tracking tool to me (I'm not that much worried about XRPs, they are only used as fees as far as I've understood, since it would otherwise not make much sense to deduct fees from every kind of IOU that can be transacted on Ripple).
My example case would be that I offer for friends (and their friends etc.) to buy small stuff on Amazon in EUR. I have 300 EUR on my bank account that I can use for that, after they are used up, I need a SEPA transaction (or some cash) of EUR to my bank account again, so I'd need to make sure that the debts of my friends are being cleared in a timely manner.
I now have 2 options as far as I see it:
1) I can ask my friends to send me the money that they owe me in Ripple (e.g. 3 friends, 100EUR each) and enter the debt as settled in Ripple.
2) I find somebody else who offers to send a SEPA transaction to someone else and accepts debt from my friends in exchange (e.g. the SEPA guy sends me 300 EUR, now my friends owe him the money, not me any more)
The big issue with this is that it seems to me like a game of  - I am not able and especially not willing to assess and audit the financial background of everyone I deal with. On the other hand, if I only use toy amounts (e.g. to enable my friends to track when I bought a coke from a vending machine) the hassle of using a complete client and get them to set up accounts and learn how to use the system doesn't pay off.
All in all: Ripple seems to me to only be useful if trusted users (= entities you trust, it can be someone I know personally or a company) use it, but it gets VERY risky for you if you trust them with large amounts and annoying for them (I guess) if you only trust them with small amounts.
It's quite possible I have severe misunderstandings in here, so maybe this helps you in seeing how others are approaching the topic.
Oh, and some other questions:
How to use the "official" client/web service?
I have 50 EUR to offer, I want to buy 2-3 Bitcoins with this. I enter ripple.com for the first time because I heard I might be able to do "something" there, what do I do now?
I'd like to gather statistics similar to analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain - what data can I actually access and what can I conclude from this data, especially aslo concerning transactions between two 3rd parties?

Imagine having 3 BTC in your wallet - one was transferred 100 days ago and since then sitting there, the other two were transferred 10 days ago and are sitting there since then.
If you now send 1 or 2 of these 3 BTC to somewhere else, you kind of reset the counter since the have been moved the last time: you can now either destroy 100 bitcoin days (from the "old" 1 BTC) or 20 bitcoin days (2*10 days from the 2 "younger" BTC).
To increase the amount of BTC days destroyed, you'd either need to transfer a LOT of recent coins or some older coins.

The fact that it is a distributed exchange system, it allows me to hold a currency I want and pay with it - while the other party receives a currency he/she wants (kinda like BitPay on steroids), allows anyone with any kind of liquidity to make markets and not just the big players, can transact fiat balances (just like a bank) irreversible (unlike a bank)... I could go on.
Unfortunately Bitcoiners seem to focus on anything that looks like a currency (XRP) rather than the payment network (Ripple) and confuse the two quite often. The stuff from TradeFortress (owner of inputs.io and ripplescam.org) doesn't make it better... even though it is the equivalent of pirateat40 hating on something, people still cling to their opinion, not unlike a lot of people in this WoW thread.

I also don't really get what Blizzard's benefit from that should be - they managed to strike an exclusive deal with PayPal for their DiabloIII real money auction house (while it lasted)... I doubt they are worried about transaction fees.
Also (the argument wordpress used, who are NOT accepting bticoin any more by the way...) enabling people to buy their services and games from regions that the US (or their banks) do not like is not a useful point, since they are an US company and are not allowing players from these regions in the first place.

Of green addresses that are accepted at more than 1 place. Ripple so far has less than a handful of gateways, still there is trading going on between them. I never even saw a BTC green address in the wild and no client that would support them (not even a pull request to bitcoin-qt).
If it is so little effort (and the idea of sharing private keys and/or have trusted addresses in Bitcoin is already quite old already) - why hasn't it been done yet then? Usually the devil is in the details, in the case of green (=trusted) addresses I also know of quite a few hurdles... one of them being that supporters of this dont seem to understand the inner workings of Bitcoin transactions concerning inputs.

I meant this one:




@_date: 2013-05-21 12:43:24
The issue with Bitcoin is that it has absolute 0 value. 1 BTC is a number in a ledger that is distributed on the internet, and that's it. Anything above that is based on trust (that you will be able to buy something with that token in the future) speculation and whatnot. I don't even have a big issue with that, after all fiat money as well has typically less than 10% of it's face value as "value" behind it.
On the other hand it is easier to get to a value for something that has 0 value in itself but can be 100% owned. This is where the value of BTC, USD, EUR, XAU etc. comes from - you can actually own these things (or at least the right to be the only person sending them in the case of BTC by holding a private key).
With debt on the other hand, you can have some value - but you cannot own it. If you own it already, there would be no debt in the first place...
This is the major issue with money since it's beginning - either you have something of no value and you artificially give some value to it (via force --&gt; fiat, open markets --&gt; BTC, necessity --&gt; barter trading vs. using money ...) OR you have something of value (IOUs) but no way of owning it. Bitcoin is one way of the medal, Ripple the other one.
Bitcoin allows you in a very smart way to securely own something you cannot trade (except for other BTC which is a bit pointless), Ripple allows you in a very smart way to trade something you cannot own.
As soon as you actually trade something in BTC, you will always have IOUs involved - Amazon sending you goods, MtGox sending you USD, a forum member sending you an ASIC. As soon as you actually settle anything in Ripple (e.g. withdrawing BTC), you remove it from the system and destroy the IOU.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:47:19
Well, actually for units of information - which entropy is. I agree though that "Bit" as name for a piece of currency is a bad name. This seems to be an American thing ("Quarters, Dimes, Nickels...") mostly, anyways most people will for the forseeable future quote Bitcoin prices like this: "10 USD worth in BTC".

Ask a merchant, any merchant, if they'd like to receive not their native currency (USD, EUR, INR) but something that they might or might not be able to sell for something close to a price they quoted.
Alternatively they can always use a service that does this for them (potentially charging your users markups in conversion rate) and can lock down their money at will, just like PayPal et.al. - the difference being that these companies are tiny startups and also (in the case of coinbase) seem to hold both ends of the deal.

A few games in the Humble store (already yesterday, but I guess it counts...) and reddit gold.

In the end it has nothing to do with Bitoin (other than you market it towards Bitcoin users), all it does is to give you a code that shows that someone deposited USD at a certain location/machine.
You then can use this knowledge to follow up with any sale - Amazon gift codes, chocolate bars, Euros, Bitcoins, carrots...

Currently the first assumption is most likely, as the system is not 100% finished and validator code hasn't been published. This means if OpenCoin really gets screwed over right now, though there might be people (illegally?) releasing/leaking the source but there won't be many developers. Think similar to Google Wave...
The system is designed to run decentralized however, so probably (personal guess, no sources for that) in 1-2 years there will be more independent developers, a bigger ecosystem and the biggest role of OpenCoin will be distribution/sale of XRP and core development as well as consulting for people/companies who want to set up gateways.

This would be a hard fork... block validity is sacred, I doubt you'll be able to get this rule pushed to mainline ever.
One possibility would be to not relay transactions on your bitcoind that have abnormally large fees and include a MAX_FEE default setting (since miners weidly often seem to just use these defaults, which are actually hurting them quite often) above which transactions are viewed as nonstandard.
It would still be posible to mess up, but it would be harder to get your transaction to a miner or into a block.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:57:38


Well... no. The idea to reach consensus via proof of work is not that novel. The novelty in my opinion is the idea of using proof of work at the same time for the distribution of the currency units. Any other system so far always tried to have a central issuer ("Because that's how currency works, right?") or assumed it was necessary and worked from that assumption on how to hide the value transacted or the participants via blind signatures etc.
Because of this by the way Bitcoin also lacks a few parts that many economists view as important parts of currency and that is what drives them crazy a bit.
Also there are a few points (e.g. very steep cutoffs of coinbase transactions every ~4 years instead of a smoother function - the 25 --&gt; 12.5 halving will be BRUTAL!) that are quite questionable and that favor early adopters a lot which makes it suspicious for non-economists too. Yes, I know about all the "oh, they took so much risk and whatnot!". Still could have been handled better than distributing 50% of all BTC within 4 years imho. Most other things were done right though and BTC anyways cought on so the chance to modify this has passed.

First of all, Bitcoins do require transaction fees, they are just dynamic and since a big part of rewards for miners doesn't come from fees, they don't care that much that you actually pay them. Expect to pay competitive fees (whatever that is!) in the future.
The other points are just basic functions of risk/reward and information within markets. Someone buying e.g. 1000 EUR today has little risk of them being worth a lot less or more tomorrow, because there are a LOT of people using them and trusting in that same thing.
If you knew a dozen years ago how stock markets look today, you would also smack your head and say "Damn, why didn't I buy this Apple stock?!". The bigger question is  - with stocks, not BTC as an example - should you buy Twitter stock right now because in 5 years they might be worth a fortune or should you not? It's similar with BTC - people who bought in early were confident that they would be worth more or at least be more useable. People buying today stand on the shoulders of these people that bought in earlier and have better infrastructure etc. but pay a higher price.
By the way, BTC can still crash back to 1 Dollar a piece, there is no regulation, backing or rule stopping them from doing so. The only thing that holds BTC afloat is the open market, so the price you see today is the current value that someone is willing to pay for 1 BTC - not less and not more.

There's also the problem that not every block header + every potential nonce might even create a single high-difficulty result (it's very unlikely though with lower difficulties). On the other hand, if one is pool-mining, finding as many nonces as possible is more interesting than finding only a single one and then starting anew with a different block header that you might have to request from a pool server.
As I understand it though, he didn't solve Block 218430 in less than a minute, but he confirmed an already known nonce to a block header (e.g. "here are 1000 nonces, one of them is the correct one, now fetch!"). To come to a conclusion from these 2 tests is a bit bold in my opinion, since it might be the case that the second nonce just lies in a bit more favorable space for the SAT-solver algorithms. If he compared 100 low-diff blocks to 100 high-diff blocks (both with the same "find the nonce out of 1000 potential ones" program) THEN we're talking.
In my understanding this aproach can only work if it is possible to ignore parts of the sha256(sha256(blockheader)) calculation, which means that sha256 is weaker than expected. If sha256 is as strong as advertised though, over several rounds a SAT solver won't be faster (but also maybe not slower, if optimized a lot) than brute forcing. What's interesting is the speedup when using a larger nonce range, though that might also be expected if the "setup" time of the SAT solver is the dominant factor with a 1000 nonce range. I doubt that speedup would hold over a long range (or at least a range useful for realistic mining results with a range of let's say 10 billions).
@_date: 2013-10-08 09:22:14
Transaction fees (and the block reward, the 25 BTC per block currently) can be used as input in a transaction that is created by the miner that mines this block.
There are already blocks that did not use this full amount (meaning these BTC will be forever gone and never be included in the block chain) and there are pools that construct this transaction in a way that the payment goes directly to a lot of miners in that pool instead of a collective account that the pool operator uses to pay miner's shares from.
To answer your question: Only the person constructing the transaction that uses the transaction fees and block reward as input decides who gets paid. This can be someone else, nobody, a lot of people or (in most cases) a single person/pool actually mining the block.

Ripples are minted/pre-issued (mining is not used in Ripple), Ripple itself is something different. I try to use "XRP" if I talk about the currency because of this confusion.
I got my XRP only in giveaways and I hold far more BTC than XRP (well, unfortunately not number wise, but value wise). I don't really consider them an investment (I just hold to see where they are going) and also would not recommend anyone to invest in XRP - I would recommend to use Ripple though.
Something like Ripple on top of Bitcoin is currently somehow in the making, colored coins or Mastercoin are two protocols that share quite a few similarities.

In comparison to other stocks or assets, Bitcoin are traded on "exchanges" that work very much differently than the NYSE...
No closing the trading (except for maintenance/hacks) for some hours per day, far more people that don't really care that much about the current price and just want to use them to buy/sell instead of doing a trading strategy, viral bubbles every year or so when buzz increases a lot, huge whales that are NOT afraid to dump from time to time, shallow order books, huge trading fees, verification delay (so if someone reads about BTC and wants some, it takes a few days(!) to be verified and until a deposit is credited, then they REALLY want to buy asap since the price went up during that time too... after some time this breaks, a whale takes a dump and many tears are shed).

Because of that, usually you'd use a middleman (a broker) who for example might offer just a selection of all possible products on that exchange, offers you some data streams so you can watch the charts without needing to worry that you might get DoSed by a high frequency trader who posts a few thousand trades per second and who takes your trade orders and forwards them (or sells you some of its own inventory, e.g. a broker might own 1000 Apple stocks and just sell you one of these instead of actually making a trade).
On most bitcoin exchanges you are far closer to the market actually, the problem being that most trading software out there expects to interact with a broker, not with an exchange directly (since that is a very unrealistic assumption, as you need to put down 6-7 digits in cash just to be allowed to directly trade there). The protocol in question is at least some company trying to create an open standard, most other stuff is unfortunately proprietory. An example would be MetaTrader, where you can even get the client completely for free (and it's a nice one too!) but they charge brokers for running their server engine and sell that, so there is no real chance that you could run that server locally and use their software. In the end very often you'll need to emulate a broker account by yourself to use existing financial software, that then in the backend executes the trades e.g. via API keys on the exchange.
There are 2 other protocols that look promising, FIX (apparently relatively loosely specified, so it might need extra work on the client side?) and OpenMAMDA (hosted at the Linux foundation, no client software in the wild that I could find, very new and maybe not even finalized spec). Before I get into issues where I need to write (or rather often: request and pay for) a custom FIX connector to connect existing software to my private bridge code, I'd rather use the one specified by SierraCharts. I don't like working with C++ though, so that's that.

I really like the function to highlight answers since you last visited a topic and it was only a few bitcents anyways... still the point is that there are costs associated with adding a payment processor and there needs to be a certain volume, that bitcoin apparently can't provide at the moment for larger places accepting them (reddit and likely humblebundle too).

Just keep a copy and after 1 year or so swipe the ones that have no transactions.

Well, his pledge to have 50k USD to provide liquidity is kinda cute... Bitfinex alone has far more than 10 times this amount in active loans ( If they rely only on an internal exchange there's FAR too little liquidity probably. On the other hand if you trade on 1 or more external exchanges as well, you risk them lagging/goxxing out.
What I love about Bitfinex is that you can also act as lender there. I don't know if Coinsetter wants to offer that as well...

There are about 4-5% of XRP in float and I'd like to know where you get your 20k-30k numbers from. I also am not too sure about this "most" statement...
Anyways, the funny thing is that Ripple supports Bitcoin already now better than a lot of actual Bitcoin exchanges and in some time there would be no way for even the most hardcore Ripple haters to know that they were not in fact paid by a Rippler in Bitcoin, just like Amazon doesn't know/care that some people buy gift cards with BTC.

Ripple actually is far older than Bitcoin. The OpenCoin implementation is not the first. You're free to implement your own Ripple network, even using the existing open source server implementation on sourceforge. You probably won't be able to interface with the OpenCoin implementation though.

Just like you can write a check to yourself with 100 Trillion USD on it... and TradeFortress' "Bitcoins" are about as useful.
Whoever accepts that check (or parts from it) is about as smart as the people trusting TradeFortess.

You mean the part where you claim rippled is a fork form bitcoind or the statement that people will put their life savings in XRP rather than in currencies they understand (be it BTC, USD or XAU)?
In the end you again (as many others) act as if you would need to hold or use XRP when using Ripple and most (if not all) of your talk against Ripple is actually complaining about XRP. Guess what: You don't have to use them! It is like saying that the USD is now threatened by the release of Twitter stocks - as long as you don't (want to) hold them, you don't have to care about them.

Also for example Litecoin was advertised as being "impossible to mine on GPU"... now people are working on FPGA implementations.
Any algorithm can be done on an ASIC/FPGA too, the question is only if the work for doing so would pay off. Bitmessage being used as much as email would probably spawn several ASICs that might even be built into mobile phones etc.
PoW is used against flooding, not spamming by the way - a small but important distinction.

I mean it is only logical that he tries to fight his competition (Ripple could be something like the "ultimate webwallet" after all), it is only sad that he did it that way and that his "service" ended how it did. I even considered offering a inputs.io &lt;--&gt; Ripple gateway, just to see how he would react. He went out of business before I could start though.

Why would anyone use PayPal to move over 6 million USD? Also if your bank charges 3.5%(!) on wire transfers and it takes more than a few hours to clear, you kinda just got ripped off by your bank.
He even mentions that Coinbase etc. just charge 0.99% - how could they possibly do that, if they get charged 3.5% by THEIR bank?

At least Ripple in its current form is no longer centralized. There is no real way to reverse payments there (which already lead to some woes). I don't know about the previous incarnation on villages.cc though.

Because I personally prefer to code in Python (portability, no compilation needed, lots of libraries, fast enough for my needs).
I currently work rather in the other end (e.g. getting tick data, trades etc. in readily available data structures from the exchange), I haven't worked on implementing the protocol, since that is something that I don't really find exciting. I might have to do it later on anyways, but I'd rather pay someone a BTC or so and be done with it instead of spending hours reading about networking messages and byte encodings...

ELI5(ish):  
While Bitcoin is similar to sending an asset (like a gold bar) to each other, Ripple heavily builds upon sending IOUs ("I owe you"s, like a cash check) to each other and being able to trade them.
If 1 Bitcoin would be something like a chocolate bar, Ripple would allow you to create a note stating "voucher for 1 chocolate bar" that you then can give to your mom for her birthday. Because she doesn't like chocolate, she trades this voucher with your dad for a kiss (or more... but let's keep this at ELI5, not ELI15) and he hands you the voucher back, receiving the chocolate bar from you.  
Your mom is happy because she could trade a voucher for a kiss, your dad is happy because he now has chocolate and you are happy because your mom did get (even though she had to trade) what she wanted at a fair market value (depending on dad...) and you did not even have to watch that kiss, since all you care about is that you hand anyone who gives you back the voucher the bar of chocolate (well, or 10% less of it, since you charge commissions and the chocolate looked REALLY yummy!).

Bottom right, "or buy with Bitcoin!" - click and you are taken to Coinbase where you can pay the USD value you entered converted to BTC.

Every time I see this URL posted, I have to resist the urge to create the same style of page only tailored towards Bitcoin... It is partly wrong/outdated, partly only tells half the story and contains only a small bit of a true problem which can be fixed by a simple flag for trust lines. Most of it is FUD and the page is created by TradeFortress by the way, of recent inputs.io "fame" who maybe saw his platform being endangered.
I agree however that Ripple is likely something that is easier to regulate (well, not the protocol itself, but the gateways - which are similar to exchanges and web wallet providers in BTC land) and understand for regulators.
Many Ripple users and a lot of devs too are hardcore Bitcoiners by the way and Ripple Labs has to do a lot of marketing and business development (and actually employs people to do that), so that might be a reason that they are often part of panel discussions etc. that deal with math based currencies.

Difficulty can increase/decrease only 4-fold in each direction, so considering the network did hash with e.g. 1 TH/s, then suddenly someone hashes with 1000000 TH/s for only 2016 blocks and leaves again it would take 8 weeks instead of 2, if the original miners with 1 TH/s in total keep mining.
I disagree with the premise that miners and/or freshly mined coins are the main source for sold BTC by the way - look at the volume numbers of Exchanges and compare them with the amount of BTC that have been mined in that time frame...
This "attack" is possible, but likely not very profitable (definitely not if you only mine for 2016 blocks). As if would be quite a direct attack one also should not keep the profit in BTC by the way in my opinion...
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:04:24
That just does mean either fees will have to become more expensive or there will be fewer miners/hash rate.

These ARE all the bitcoin purchases, they are all processed by Coinbase (and likely paid in USD to HumbeBundle).
