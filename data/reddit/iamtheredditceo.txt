Aww damn you could have made lots of money with 5.9 BTC. I appreciate your enthusiasm which makes me feel better :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:35:59
You're right. Even though I tell myself that, sometimes I need some motivation before I make a mistake.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:40:25
Yeah you are right. I just panic at certain moments just because my previous investments didn't go well.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:42:36
That is true. I always take a Gamble and see where it goes and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:39:45
Yeah it's really high volatile which is why South Korea is cracking down on it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:42:06
You are right, it happened before and I'm sure it will happen again!
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:55:59
Even though I put $3K into Bitcoin, unfortunately I put more than I am comfortable with. Even though I'm wondering whats the point of selling it when I lost about $1K when I don't know what is going to happen anytime soon. I'm just worried about the South Korea situation and how it's taking a toll on Bitcoin. 
More afraid of it dropping less than $10K but I don't know. It's hard to think about hodl when it can drastically go down to $5K or $1K when you put in money at $17K.

Yeah I learned that lesson recently...

Thank you Born4Teemo! I appreciate your inspiring words! You are right, it is the perfect time to expand crypto portfolio and be assured everything will be alright :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:38:58
I agree but then again it's similar to the stock market. It goes up and down but this one is tricky. I'm sure it will go up but it's just a matter of time that it will go up.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:41:25
You're totally right. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:58
Given I bought very little, but I bought in $19K so it's not as bad as yours. Don't worry too much about it, it will go up!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:57:04
No problem man :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:44
I bought 0.03 I believe at $19K. Buy it while you can!
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:16:40
Don't remind me ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:27:49
I'm just wondering if it will do a huge dip anytime soon? The more I wait, the more I lose a great opportunity to invest!
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:12:44
I was thinking of doing that when it hit $12.8K but then I told myself to not panic sell and it went up to $14K but now it's going down again ������
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:38
Selling all my stocks and putting it in BTC! Life is really going to get wild!
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:50:54
Oh my bad, I misunderstood! I thought you mentioned the amount of years you invested in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:26:18
I'll look into getting one of these soon! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:33:56
Thanks for the advice! Yeah if it hits a dip, I might freak out but I'll try to control it ��
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:31:49
I believe I didn't research enough, because I read many people use different apps for Bitcoin wallet and some sources recommended Coinbase, so I went with it. I didn't think about the possibility of them being hacked or going bankrupt. 
What do you recommend using for Bitcoin purchases?
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:07:06
It happens on many subreddits! To be fair, this is the first time I posted something like this! 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:27:23
8 years! Wow! You must have taken in lots of money these several months!
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:29:34
Lucky you bought it earlier and cheaper than me! I bought it at $4300. I have the same reaction as you lol!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:30:12
I believe so! I'm sure it will go higher so I'm not too worried.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:31:26
I plan to hold onto it for a while, so let's hope it continues to go up!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:29:41
Sounds good! Like right now, it went below $4000 but I won't look at it so I won't think about the possibilities of it decreasing even more.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:05:39
Yeah there is time, this is my first investment so I'm hoping I made a decent decision with this!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:28:07
I understand! I'll use another service to store my BTC Wallet!
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:29:00
To be honest, I'm not sure. I just bought it off of Coinbase at $4300 and based on what I see, it goes to BTC Wallet. Other than that, I'm not sure where it is being stored?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:26:34
Thank you! I will check it out!
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:59:32
Awww you little romantic you!!!!
