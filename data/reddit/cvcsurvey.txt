No, it's for a academic paper which won't be publicized.


No. Just gathering data to analyze for the paper.




You are right that I can see the IP address of the survey taker. I like that you are aware of that. But an IP address alone isn't of any value to me and I am not interested in that anyways.

Thanks I will have a look, very nice of you.

Well all of the information gathered is anonymous besides that I can see the time the survey was taken. The question about income can also be skipped so you aren't really giving away valuable information which a hacker would have to have. But I respect your awareness about the data you publicize about yourself. (btw. if a hacker really has the skills I think somebody with around 10k isn't very interesting in his/her eyes...)

Oh great comment, thanks for making me aware of that. What you did is perfect though as it still lets me know what Industry you're based upon.

I am reachable by reddit, I intentionally didn't want make my email available to everyone. I will analyze the data in around a month. If you are interested in the results just DM me around that time :) I hope that's okay for you.

Yeah I am aware and intentionally created it to force you to rank. If not people will undoubtedly just rank everything nr.1 which isn't useful for analyzing.

My School isn't in the USA so we don't have laws stipulating an ethics board. I don't think it's wise of you to make assumptions like this so quickly.
