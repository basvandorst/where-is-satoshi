Ah ok - thanks for clearing that up. It's refreshing to be involved with a project that doesn't tailor the pre-sale for whales only. I really hope they do well.

No one on the far right is too smart. I've checked.

When Charlie Lee sold his coins, Litecoin in effect became about as decentralised as a cryptocurrency has been.

ICO for Coinmetro is over? Unless you're referring to one of their flash sales.

They're coming. You can't just be compliant and operational overnight with this stuff. I think they'll all open at once around Q2 this year.

Yes. In the world of crypto verification is your friend.

I understand your concerns but it is justified, they allow you to buy, sell and hold real currency. Are you nervous giving that information to your bank? Make sure the exchanges you use are worthy of your trust. 
Imagine you are in the situation where you are locked out of one of these sites (your phone broke and you can no longer use 2 factor authentication, to use a common example). How much harder do you think this will be to rectify with their support teams if you have not already verified who you are?

Dude, I don't mean to be short but I'm not customer support for any of the exhanges. You need to do your own due diligence and don't put money into something you're not fully comfortable with.

This progressive says no.

Big words for such a tiny mind. Thanks for schooling me on the state of Europe too. I live here and somehow hadn't realised all those things were going on, I obviously just needed a paranoid Internet racist from the US to tell me how things really are.

That's what you call defending the Jim Crow segregation laws and the nazis? Your post history is sub human.

I don't believe you have enough information to draw that conclusion. I just see the world differently to you, for example, I view diversity as a good thing. I'm also able to apply socioeconomic context to statistics.

Cheers for proving my point. As you were.

That's not true at all. Your claim to know the data is being shown up here. And frankly I'm done with this conversation. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:59:15
Your level of ignorance is astonishing.
