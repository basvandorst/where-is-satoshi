Haha, bitcoinmalaysia is a joke. They are just interested in making a quick buck. Rm 50(sale price!!!) to join their mobile chat.
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:01:49
Good enough
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:31:13
Still kinda impressive.
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:43:54
You guys are assholes...guy made a cool bot, if it answers questions, its not unsolicited. This kind of stuff attracts people's attraction and is within the spirit of bitcoin.

Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

Link to thread/proof???

Are people really that desperate?

Please do not support spec work. Hire a designer based on his portfolio.

Y'all being played...
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:16:05
I have no idea what I'm looking at...
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:54:02
Adjust the levels and contrast
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:08:26
That kinda sucks, no offence...
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:57:51
Isn't coingig basically doing the same job???
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:12:50
I thought it was Pierce Brosnan, was disappoint...

A proper online bitcoin-exchange is for the time being a bit out of our reach due to the security concerns involved. We have been considering a similar idea but we don't currently have the necessary resources to safely do this for the time being.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:04:22
Lol, $500 usd to "test"...
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:21:23
Your bitpay button is broken...
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:51:41
I meant the cover of the G8 doc looks cheaply shopped...
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:25:50
A poper adverting network. I wanted to advertise a project on reddit but they do not accept btc yet, and as someone without a cc its a bummer...
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:06:32
Watching you guys freak out each time there is a crash and trying to console yourselves with "positive" news is kinda fun. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:07:53
A bit of both.
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:31:25
Sup with the shitty shopped cover? lol
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:44:39
Thanks. Happy holidays to you too!
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:58:07
What if the guy left most of the coins in a wallet for like 1-3 years then tried to cash it? Most people would have stopped monitoring him by then, assuming bitcoin is still a thing by then...
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:02:34
Aha!I just got it, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:01:10
Didn't convert to fiat, btc was at $1000+ I think, made around 1btc...I've closed my website since then though...
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:43:02
Wordpress, woocommerce and bitcoin plugin
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:49:42
I don't think that we should lobby for big retailers to accept bitcoins. We should introduce bitcoins to small businesses, this is an opportunity for them to strive. Most big retailers would just convert them back to fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:50:26
How much are you looking to buy? Try localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:12:20
Wait, you have to pay to register on SA's forum? lol
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:58:17
They will probably mine and hoard, then sell when they find a way to bypass the regulation or simply not do it via banks or regulated online services. MAYBEE...
Or, chinese silkroad...
