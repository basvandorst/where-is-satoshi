Only taxable when you trade bitcoin for dollars, or anything else tangible, like a yacht

Well yeah I’m just saying people should hodl right now so we can hit 10k :)

You can go on gdax and make limit orders so when it dips you can capture it without being at the computer/phone. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:01:44
Deposit money into ur Coinbase acc. Transfer it to gdax for free then buy on the exchange to avoid fees
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:55:57
My asking price would probably have to do with the demand of bitcoin at the present time. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:44:54
Plus if you sell you pay capital gains tax. It’s almost the end of the year! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:51:12
Exactly. Transfer money from your bank acc, transfer to gdax for free, then buy. Only problem is it takes a couple days to clear. On Gemini you get the funds right away, but can’t sell or withdrawal your coins

1) No fee for pulling money out of gdax that you haven’t already spent. 
2) Day trading can be profitable, if you can time the market, which it’s very hard to do. Most people say holding is best. 
Mess around with buy/sell limits and stop orders too. Do some research

Use gdax for instant buys

No there’s a gif online look up super hot fire gif

Gdax is what I use. You can figure it out on your own but I suggest watching a short 5 min YouTube video on the charts to know exactly what’s going on

If you can’t figure out fractions and decimals you should do a lot more research in bitcoin before investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:05:28
So technically you could buy bitcoin on Gemini for 100$ cheaper than Coinbase, the go ahead and sell that bitcoin on Coinbase right away and make 100$?

They explain it all. Maker vs taker has different fees. Makers get lower fees because they place an order in the book that doesn’t get filled immediately because they want to buy at a lower price. Takers put in an order at current price, gets filled immediately, but pay higher fees.

I’ve found that Coinbase works best for beginners, and is a great way to jump into bitcoin. One advantage to Coinbase is that you don’t have to wait 10 days for your bank to transfer funds to your account in order to buy. This incentivizes small buys, which most beginners are looking for.

As Shia Labeouf said, “JUST DO IT!”

If people lose a big chunk of btc, there will be less in circulation. Then.. supply and demand 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:05:41
Do you not see the huge sell wall at 10k?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:24:20
Blockchain.info app is cool
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:47:03
Gdax = Coinbase. It’s just their exchange. You can use your Coinbase login credentials on gdax to buy or sell instantly with much lower fees
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:54
Hodl 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:47:16
Well if you cash out before Jan 1 2018, won’t you have to claim your gains on tax returns for the 2017 year
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:37:11
Do you have a link explaining exactly what these testimonials mean and how to take advantage
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:57:11
No, it’s... uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:16:08
Same thing happened to me on Gemini before I even did any trading. I’ve had good luck with Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:36:58
Plastic baggie maybe? Keep water out
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:53:59
This is gold!
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:56:03
There’s many sites that have order books and buy/sell charts. Find one you can understand and keep learning 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:21:09
You can buy fractions of bitcoin. You can start with 10$ if you want.
