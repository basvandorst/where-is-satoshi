I'm having trouble seeing the incentive for massively connected hubs to open channels outward. For it to be useful, they need to connect to thousands of nodes. Imagine all the on-chain transactions and money they have to coordinate.

I think the technology will work. What I'm skeptical about is adoption. It makes total sense for people to open up channels with highly connected hubs. But what incentive does a hub have to connect to you, the end user? What incentive does the hub have to connect to each and every local coffee or retail store? I don't see how the math adds up.

Why would they cover it? You should check that again....

What happens if a coin comes along that is great at both being a store of value and a currency? What reason would there be to use bitcoin.
You must always be innovating and improving the technology. Otherwise you end up like MySpace.

Hey, the chances of the IRS knowing you have traded all your crypto assets is pretty small, and they won't even really care unless it is a substantial amount. Your choice to evade the taxes is entirely your decision.
But my concern as a long time participant on this sub is that someone reads your original post and thinks the IRS has no jurisdiction which is simply untrue.
You can choose not to pay your taxes, but please don't spread misinformation to confuse everyone else who does want to follow the law.

They actually have complete jurisdiction....Cryptos are considered assets by the IRS - kind of like having gold or any other asset that appreciates / depreciates. If you bought an old collectible car at $15000 and sold it for $25000, you'd have to pay tax on the gains...

To put things in perspective, the company Uber did not exist a decade ago and at one point it was reportedly to be valued at nearly $70 billion....Which is, as of the time of this comment, greater than the entire market capitalization of Bitcoin.

* Set aside some $ to pay taxes on your gains on the bitcoins. 
* Buy 1 bitcoin back and don't pussy out. Hold for 5+ years. 
* Invest the rest in index funds and take the win.

Credit cards charge their own fees (typically 30 cents + 2.9% per transaction) -- so coinbase is charging an extra 1% to 2% on top of that to cover their fees + profit. So it is not completely unreasonable. That's what you get with credit cards.
Coinbase lets you do a bank transfer to avoid that fee. Why not do that?

It's a valid strategy. You can either pour more resources into BCH to mine more coin, or you can harm BTC to raise the value of BCH. Whether it will work out long term remains to be seen. If BTC is resilient to this type of manipulation, it will strengthen its own cause.

There is nothing in the bitcoin protocol that enforces miners to mine blocks with transactions. An empty block is still a valid block and therefore will not be ignored.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:26:35
We want low transaction fees and shorter transaction confirmation times. When a block is mined, you stuff as many transactions in that block as possible. If you mine an empty block, you are deliberately slowing down and congesting the network since you aren't pushing any transactions through, but more transactions are being piled on to the queue to get processed in that time. The amount of hashing power they have has no bearing on whether the block is invalid or not. Anyone can mine an empty block, regardless of how much hashing power they have. An empty block every now and then is not a big deal, but the reason it is sabotage is that since they do have a lot of hashing power, they are able to mine many empty blocks in a short period of time.

I think you are over complicating it. Think of Bitcoin as gold and the block chain, aka ledger, is just the tool that proves which transactions are legitimate.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:41:49
No, antpool distributes the block reward to their participating miners and they keep the transaction fees for themselves. Since there's no transaction fees, they are not making any money (in fact, they are voluntarily giving up tens of thousands of dollars in tx fees) just to harm bitcoin.
In your case, if antpool mines block 502 again and it is empty, all those transactions are still in the mempool waiting to be processed in block 503. All the while, new transactions are building up in the mempool and since there's even more congestion, tx fees go up and confirmation times increase. And yes, you would hope that antpool has a long losing streak so that good miners have the opportunity to mine full blocks and decongest the network.

I had no idea stripe integrated with bitcoin. That's awesome, thanks.

I need help understanding Lightning Network. Every time I see someone touting how great Lightning Network is, I get so confused. And perhaps my understanding of lighting network isn't at all thorough so maybe you can help me understand. For example, as Bitcoin is today, you could not go into a coffee shop and buy a coffee. Well, you could, but the transaction fee for a 10 minute confirmation would be more than the coffee itself. Okay, so I see people on Reddit touting Lightning Network to solve this problem. Great! How does it work?
- You need to open a channel with a business or another individual. This is one on-chain transaction.
- Both counter-parties need to commit a certain amount of funds to the channel, locking up those funds for the duration the channel is open.
- To close out the channel is another on-chain transaction.
The above is not a system that can be used for peer to peer transactions. It won't solve the coffee example above because you need two on-chain transactions. Then you might argue that the point is you go to this coffee shop all the time -- Okay -- let's use Starbucks as an example. Let's pretend Starbucks has their own lightning hub that all Starbucks can connect to so you can use your bitcoin at all locations. If you put $50 into the channel, subtracting fees, let's say you only drink Starbucks twice that month. Starbucks is still a business with cash flow and they need to close out channels, but they can't close your channel out because you only spent $8 and it's not worth it for them to close it until you spend more. Now money is tied up and causes cash flow. Most businesses need to make payroll every two weeks, so closing channels out that frequently is tough.
So let's move away from this model and pretend that Lighting Network gets really advanced where Starbucks can connect to some popular hubs and you connect to one of those hubs. These hubs connect thousands of business and thousands of people. Your money goes through there and to the business. This is great because now your money is tied to a single hub that can be used for many businesses, not a single entity. This is great for businesses because they can handle thousands or millions of transactions and close out to settle on-chain every two weeks to meet payroll.
It actually sounds amazing and is probably where this is all headed....But didn't we just create a centralized network of trusted hubs? Both parties need to agree on the hubs, etc, etc.
Oh yeah, these hubs take a small transaction fee.
Did we just re-invent credit card processors on Bitcoin? These hubs are just acting like a Stripe or Authorize.NET. The centralized nature of how Lightning Network will ultimately end up is the very thing we are trying Bitcoin not to be.
This is why I'm confused about the Lightning Network.

Does this mean that if bitcoin changes its difficulty algorithm to be more flexible, it would mitigate this? A drop in hashrate wouldn't do anything if the difficulty decreases shortly after.
EDIT: this could also be a case of correlation does not imply causation.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:25:25
I didn't even think about that -- but that explains why I read somewhere that you really need $50k to start a hub -- which would mean hubs would be even further centralized since not every person can tie up that amount of funds.
