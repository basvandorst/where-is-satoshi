Mastering Bitcoin is a great book, and you can learn a lot without any programming background. I highly recommend it!

And meanwhile the front page is filled with memes, as always. Where is the tech discussion?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:27:07
Any examples?

Just making it sure, I can freely use those fancy looking GDPR icons on the website of my company?

These look absolutely amazing as well as all the others on the site! Keep up the good work.

Add Google trends 'bitcoin' or 'buy bitcoin' to this and you got a nice pile of evidence about no one giving a damn. Media hype is long gone and next one does not seem very likely.

Ecoin is already out in season 2.
Mr. Robot is full of bitcoin references and in the end the government &amp; E-corp are afraid of its decentralization, great scene!

I am sorry you are this stupid, it must be difficult

What do you mean with getting routed around?

If you are planning a long term investment, then I would put it all on bitcoin. Maybe some small amounts to promising altcoins with already working product/concept.

What does it use? Just btw

I like the idea of Siacoin, look it up sia.tech

Yes, totally. I was asking the same question here before reading and now that I have finished the book, I can tell you it is awesome. Probably the best book ever made about Bitcoin.
