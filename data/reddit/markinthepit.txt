I just tried to remove a small amount of my holdings with them to my bank account and they said they could not let me for legal reasons.  I live in the USA.  They flat out said via support that it is illegal to withdraw funds via card, bank wire and coin pay within the USA. Does matter how high they say the coins are worth if you can't ever cash out.  Only places that matter with price are cash out and checkout, everything else is just fluff.

It wouldn't have anything to do with the miners or blockchain, just develop a mobile wallet that has an optional button durring spend that says "watch a short video to send this transaction for free" hook that up to adsense or whatever and tie in your btc wallet somehow to cover the send fee.  You just need to make sure the adsense view pays more than the spend fee.

Just print some fliers with a logo, short description and links to more info.  If you Google you might be able to find something all ready in existence.  Then take them to small businesses in your area that you frequent.  Ask politely if you can leave some info with them and make yourself available to answer any questions.  Anybody can do that :)  Don't just staple flyers everywhere or leave them on windshields.  Basically don't do the real world version of spamming.
Edit: Also, don't get all preachy / new world order on them either. Just let them know that it exists and how easy it is to start using.  Let them take the lead from there on how much they want to learn.

Hmmm.. Ok, I was just curious because my wallet started out at bitcoin.com, then I started using blockchain.info and I was able to restore the bitcoin.com wallet into blockchain.info using only the passphrase.  Was hoping I could do something similar with the core desktop wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:22:17
Just make sure you have your paraphrase or private key written down first.  Just enter that to restore the wallet later.  You can download another wallet and load in the paraphrase to test it first before resetting to confirm it works .

There is a lot going on in the blockchan and mempool right now so it will most likely take a few hours.
Did you send from coinbase or gdax?  
If coinbase click on the transaction under recent transactions on your dashboard, when the card opens click on view transaction, that will take you to live.blockcypher.com where you can see your transaction in progress.  You should also be able to see how many confirmations you have from that card.
If gdax hover over the menu icon in the top right, click on accounts/ bch (far left bottom) / trasfers (top right under menu icon).  Copy / paste the transaction hash ID to the search bar in  and hit enter.  That will pull up the activity in the blockchain.

I look at is as a savings account, not an investment.  I just dribble it in with no intention of getting out.  Just kind of keep loading it up till it's actually spendable as is sometime when the tech matures.  If it goes up great, if it doesn't oh well, don't have in more than I can afford to lose.  In my head the money is all ready spent.  I personally wouldn't "get out" unless I had an emergency I needed to take care of.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:08
So does that mean we'll break even and then all other currencies will explode?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:55:57
Maybe they can work in some kind of pin thing like with debit cards?  Or in your wallet app you can kill that specific code.  I mean, same thing as if you lose a credit / debit card, anyone can spend it if they find it.  So long as you don't have your recovery phrase on there you should be fine.  But that is a risk of not having someone else hold your money.  
People pooh pooh the banks all the time but are really happy when they loose their wallet and fraud protection steps in, gives them back what was spent and all new cards.  
Don't get me wrong, I want to see bitcoin succeed, I want banks to continue to exist, not for personal gain as I own very very little in both, but bitcoin does have it's place and I would like the opportunity to use it at an every day place if I wanted to.

Yes, for now. But if everyone started using litecoin instead of bitcoin then litecoin would be the one  backlogged and have higher fees.  It will all fluctuate.  As far as picking one coin for every day shopping, I think at this time it is not a realistic choice.  I would Google to find out which coin is best for me and then just convert as needed to spend if trying to rely on crypto for shopping.

I heard of it back in 2010 and didn't think anything of it, thought it would just be like online game money. I don't game at all so I put it out of my head.  In 2014 a client asked me if I accepted bitcoin as payment for a web development project.  I laughed at him and said I only accepted real money.  On December 3rd 2017 I saw a Facebook ad about that weird haired guy selling some kind of crypto class to make millions.  Don't care too much about making millions or getting rich but I did spend the rest of the day reading everything I could find on the subject.  I beleive in the tech, I don't think any of the currencies are ready for mainstream spending yet.  I do think it will get there in my lifetime. I just kind of wanted a piece of the old grand daddy crypto currency as kind of owning a piece of history from my time era.  If it does end up being useable then there will be no point in holding on to it any longer as it will just be like hanging on to a paper dollar.  I plan on buying the dip for fun when I can afford it.

A fork is different than what would be considered a split for a normal stock.  
Fork = New currency not in any way tied to the original bitcoin value. You gain nothing unless you own the actual coin the fork came from. Futures do not constitute actual coin ownership.
Split = Doesn't happen with cryptocurrency, at least that I am aware of, where value essentially drops by half and you own double the asset which has the opportunity to increase in value.

Running a full node is like casting your vote with every fork stating that the coin you were using yesterday is the same coin you are using today.  It also allows for the impossibility of wiping out the ledger as there are thousands of redundant copies.  It also helps increase the security of the ledger as all nodes must sync up exactly,  The more nodes running the less of a possibility of someone or a group trying to make malicious changes to the ledger be it add more coin to a specific wallet or take coin from many wallets.

So I setup this ad and ran it yesterday evening before that last little growth spurt. Coincidence? Most likely :). Any ways, I had donate option on the ad so that I could hopefully gain a stream of ad network funding to keep it rolling.
In transparency I disclosed that I would claim 10% for my efforts because effort takes time away from a paying job and I like to do those greedy things like pay a mortgage and feed my family.
Long story short, as anticipated, instead of taking 10% of a rolling ad placement fund I took 100% of a budget deficit :).
If anyone else would like to take this ad and run it ( by all means swap the QR code to your own, in fact please do, I don't want free money, if you're going to pay me go buy a homeless person a roasted chicken from a grocery store or something instead.)
If anyone is interested in the PSD source file let me know and I'll post it for download.

I'd Like to see Ver and Antonopoulos in a dance off.... just saying... 
That aside, I am not sure a spot on CNBC would be a good fit for Andreas.  His talks are a bit long winded and should not be stifled by segment blocks of time.  He would need a more relaxed atmosphere where people aren't hammering questions at him under a time budget deadline.  I would suggest something more like the Howard Stern Show? or Oprah, opposite ends of the spectrum but both have a very large following and their interview styles are very drawn out low pressure situations.  
Oprah show: We would get to hear the long drawn out pain of life by devoting to this cause which then rewarded him with wealth beyond his dreams.
Howard Stern Show: We would get to learn the real Andreas and what makes him tick.  Hear some of the saltier sides of his life that would relate him more to the every man.
If you need to send a letter somewhere I recommend those two or other similar media figures.

Everyone I speak with has a hard time with that philosophy. Most want to dump in as much as possible and then cash out quickly because for some reason most people are experienced day traders now. Others wouldn't touch it with a 10' clown pole. Others still feel that it's the new world currency and want to be all in all the time.  I think there is room for both crypto and fiat currency and for the sake of this post I'll over simplify by saying both have their strengths and weaknesses and can be used when suited for a specific need.

Not sure why everyone wants to cash out, just hang on to it and spend it as is.  That keeps the value up and everyone stays millionaires.  This isn't like any other stock or trade, this is an investment you can spend directly. 
It's only going to become more and more accepted as it gains exposure.
Congrats on your initial investment and my condolences on being hood winked.  If it makes anyone feel any better I've made lots of bad investments :).  You just kind of carry around a secret shame (cough cough pot stocks).

This is a good place to start.  I don't think there is a posted list anywhere with the forking roadmap (at least not one that I would trust came directly from the creators of bitcoin).  If anyone reading this does know of such a thing please share.  But I just kind of read the news page on the bitcoin website.  There are postings here and there announcing and discussing planned forks and other updates.

Dont beleive anyone.  Bitcoin will be painful for a while because it's capacity is red lining due to massive influx of new users.  It was nothing like this a few months ago.  It will get worse all around regarding all coins before it gets better.  I am sticking with bitcoin because to me it has the most value (in both finance and nostalgia).  It's not like people have nothing else to use right now but bitcoin. Just store the value until a solution comes in and do your every day shopping in fiat like everyone has been doing forever.

Its not any harder to accept one over the other.  It's also very easy to convert the currency via changely or shapeshifter.  I would just put up a sign saying you accept crypto currency and see what is offered to pay for things.  I believe there are a few multi currency wallets out there.  Personally I use blockchain.info *gasp*. Most people on here pooh pooh it but it's fast enough and minimalish and easy for me to use.

Also, expensive is relative.  If having a whole coin is important then yes, bitcoin is expensive.  When it comes to spending, the portions of coin you spend are all proportionate to your counties corresponding fiat.

1) They do that all ready sort of. 
2) Eh... I don't believe in that one coin to rule them all.  Maybe there would be a few options to choose from like Overstock checkout.  Not sure it would effect market, might bog down transfers though.  On the flip side, if paying in on taxes, who cares how long it takes to clear.
3) Not saying you have to, but would be a nice option to have.

Honestly, if this happened to me I'd tell the guy to send out what ever he has, everyone I know work and professional would get over it.  Next time just put a peice of tape on it.
But then again, I'm a cheap SOB that doesn't stand for getting taken advantage of.  I'd rather everyone found out my secret shames than have my money stolen.
If they actually do send it out and people say anything about it, just shrug it off as one of those every body poops kind of deals.  Besides, what is stopping the them from sending anyways or asking for more money at a later time?

I would buy so many bitcoins if he dumped the rest and crashed the market price down into the low hundreds of dollars.  That kind of correction would also help weed out a lot of the alt coins as well.   You know as soon as that stash is gone there won't be much else to hold the price back.

Call Chase, talk to a live person, explain what you intend to do and get pre approval for the transfer.  This will stop them from blocking as a fraud attempt and raising red flags.  Worst case they tell you no, you can't accept funds from them and you find another bank that does.

I've had similar issues to this, it was the bank flagging as fraud which is out of Coinbases controll.  Simply had to call and speak with a person from their fraud department to explain it was me doing it intentionally and that it was not a fraud attempt.  After that transactions were approved and went through.

I agree in that they should not receive restitution in fiat currency.  They should receive bitcoin.  It would be up to the coin owner to decide weather or not to sell it.  Is it possible to setup a class action against the lawyer for damages incurred during price collapse at time of mass sell?

Dual password protect wallet with fail safe, meaning it works 3 ways.  1 password opens the wallet, a second password will lock it for 72 hours, or 3 incorrect attempts will also lock it for 72 hours or transfer funds to a remote wallet, your choice.
You put in the 2nd password after the first wrenching when you are scared but still ambitious and then there is nothing that can be done except prepare for a long weekend to try again.
To my knowledge this does not exist, but if you have enough btc to worry about losing that bad I am sure you could afford to have a wallet (android, iOS, hardware, blackberry if that's still a thing?) developed with that kind of functionality.  
Edit: I copy pasted this from another comment I made, hence the wrench talk etc... 
P.S. I know they are looking to voulenteer but please don't forget to tip your dev team.  It really does take a lot of hours out of their life to create something new.
