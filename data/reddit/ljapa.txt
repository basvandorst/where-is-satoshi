Correct. But the parent post is also correct. The parent says there's nothing in the protocol that prevents it. You said you aren't supposed to. In the last few months, we've seen at least two exchanges that did. They weren't supposed to, but the bitcoin protocol didn't stop them. 
One is out of business and the other likely will be soon. That doesn't mean that none of the functioning exchanges aren't also running fractional reserves.

No, that I get. My question was about the wiki claim that transaction ids could change after mining. You're describing the bad edge case handling of MtGOX pre-mining--and their inability to recognize post mining. 
EDIT: I'm an idiot. Chain reorganization means orphaned blocks. I get it now. 
Thanks.

And, I think for someone new to bitcoin, getting their information from the press and most of the comments here, your questions were quite insightful. I'd love to hear your thoughts once you have looked at the code, the protocol and how mining works. 
I've seen it peripherally mentioned here, but reading about the unintended fork in April because of a protocol change would also be informative. Basically new code allowed for the creation of blocks that could not be recognized by the old code. Once one was found, new miners worked on a chain off of that and old miners ended up with a different chain. 
The issue was recognized. The larger pools agreed to abandon the new chain and not emit unreadable blocks until a large portion of the miners had upgraded and could accept the new blocks. They locked down the specific block where the new blocks could exist and made that fact very public.

I'm bothered by the fact that fractional reserve banking creates money out of thin air via debt. And that there are more people in debt than there are those with a surplus. 
I love bitcoin, but I struggle to understand how a bitcoin economy can help these people. 
Credit is going to tough in a deflationary system. Do I loan one bitcoin out with the promise of one bitcoin back in a year?  It will probably be worth more, but I could hang onto it and be guaranteed that growth in spending capability.  
How does a bitcoin based economy increase the availability of credit for entrepreneurs?  
I'm not anti bitcoin, and I think FED policy has made credit too available, but I'd like to hear a discussion of credit in a bitcoin economy.

But the rewritten transaction still sends change to the change address, so the second transaction isn't a double spend. 
EDIT:  I'm wrong. Post 31 on the thread you linked. The bitcoin protocol uses transaction ids as the input for transactions.  The assumption used to be you could immediately spend from your change address because that spend was using the transaction id giving you the change as input. 
Wouldn't a rescan of the blockchain fix this, though?

They were abandoned, but I understand they were prioritized in the next few blocks mined and all were included.

Nope.  You send coins to the public address associated with the private key. 
Only that private key can send coins from that address, and you can even do that offline and just publish the transaction.

What made bitcoin revolutionary was making sure that crypto-hash, as you call it, uncounterfeitable. So MtGox held the crypto-hash and the cash for you, so you could trade. 
Up until late 2013, getting bitcoin in and out was easy. Since people could pull bitcoin at any time, those who ignored other warning signs left their bitcoin in MtGox, so they could take advantage of any trade swings.  For pretty much all time, getting dollars in and out was a pain. About a year ago, getting dollars out became impossible, which is one of those warning signs people should have paid attention to.

You are effectively treating the alts as a zero cost 100% gain, if you are only realizing the bitcoin gain.  If you purchased the alts, then bought bitcoin and then sold the bitcoin, your calculations are probably more complex, but likely save you money. 
If you mined the alt, it's a hell of a lot more complex and who knows what it does to what you owe.

Somebody could code this up from what has been released. My understanding is that there are details of all mtgox deposits and withdrawals with amounts down to the satoshi and timestamps. 
It should be easy to take that and cross-reference the blockchain to find the transactions. 
Withdrawals will come from hot wallets, but you can trace those back to likely cold wallets. Deposits likely go to unique addresses, but that probably gets moved to hot wallets, but you should be able to find some sweeps to cold wallets. 
Bitcoin is a public ledger. There's a leaked list of inputs and outputs. Write code to find those in the public ledger and then start putting the puzzle together.

Thank you. That actually helped, and yes, I had tried reading some of these but hadn't found the right ones. 
So, in a nutshell, the core complaint of much of the community with Segwit2x is that it pushes blocksize higher up to a max of 8mb, which means decentralization of nodes. It's also being pushed hard by commercial interests that would benefit from centralized nodes. 
People like me would see no benefit and could see some issues with commercial entities controlling the bulk of the nodes. 
Lightning networks could also ultimately address this capacity issue, but in such a way that the commercial entities couldn't exercise the same control and some miners fear fee loss. 
So, few of the objections are technical but political. I'd have to say, I agree. 
Thanks again.  I really wasn't trying to troll, I just hadn't found good discussions with some of the basics explained.

My guess as well. 
There’s just no way CME started looking at bitcoin futures weeks (months?) ago and people in the know didn’t start loading up. 
But that still doesn’t answer my central question: How is it the massive money that will be in play in CME futures is going to decrease volatility in bitcoin when small subsets of that massive money will cause large shifts in bitcoin?

Does this mean stories about blockchain technology that aren't sing the Bitcoin blockchain are out of scope?
When Patrick Byrne's T0 was announced, there was speculation his shares weren't on the Bitcoin blockchain. That seems like a big story, but it also seems like one that wouldn't belong here. 
Is my understanding correct?  Or, is it because we didn't know when the announcement came out, that it might be in scope?

But UBS isn't talking about using Bitcoin. It's a blockchain of their own making, so they can architect it however they like. 
Not quite sure how you prevent a 50% attack in that scenario. But, it's not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:25:20
Yep.   You got it. 
Realize, too, that since each block uses a reference to the previous block, a transaction that occurred 10 blocks ago is secured by all the computing power of all the intervening blocks. 
As long as the math holds, your spend or receive gets more and more impossible to counterfeit over time. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:17:31
There is no main program.  Info regarding where bitcoins are is kept in the blockchain. It's a public ledger. Its digital. It can be copied. 
It's a list of public addresses saying how much Bitcoin is in each (and where every Bitcoin in it came from).
But the coins are all locked inside their addresses via some complex mathematical algorithms. To spend one you need the private key. With the private key, you can make a mathematical signature tied to the public address saying, "I want to take X bitcoins in this public address and send them to public address Y."
The math is such that it's easy for everyone to verfy that you control the private key. 
So there's a bunch of distributed computers who listen for these transactions. They tumble them through another mathematical algorithm to try to create a number smaller than the current target. This number comes by rearranging the various transactions, info on the last set of transactions, and tossing in a random number. 
The math is such that you can't work backwards. You can't tell what the number is until you've run the calculations. So, if you do and your number isn't small enough, you try again with a different random number, or you rearrange the transactions, or you grab some new transactions. 
Once you get a small enough number, you tell everyone else. The math, again, is such that it's easy for everyone to verify you found the correct arrangement of transactions and random number. 
Once you broadcast that, everyone checks. If they agree, they immediately take the info from your block of transactions and start looking for the next small number.  The person who finds a block, i.e. finds that small number, gets rewarded with new bitcoins to spend. 
So, the ability to spend a Bitcoin is tied to the math and your private key. The fact that you spent it is tied to the math creating the block of transactions. 
Lots of really smart people have looked at the math. No one has any serious concerns of issues with that math. Any one can write a program that can do the math. There are a number of different programs. 
So ultimately you "own" a bitcoin because you control the private key. If we both have the same private key that controls one Bitcoin, we don't have two; instead, whoever spends first controls the one Bitcoin. 
Thief steals your private key and sends your coin to another address he controls. He's just stolen your Bitcoin.

What made Bitcoin look promising enough for you to buy in / mine?
Mining in 2011 when I saw it on slashdot. I was impressed with the crypto behind it. I was not convinced it would amount to much. I got a MTGox account and bought almost right at the high of the $30 spike in late 2011. I actually sold some off for a loss, but kept mining. 
How was your financial situation beforehand? What was your reaction to the recent price jumps?
I'm not rich, but I'm financially comfortable. The credit cards are paid off in full every month. I purchased a camera from bitcoinstore.com during the early 2013 spike, but kept mining and didn't sell. I also ordered a butterfly ASIC around then. I stopped mining in late spring and started back up in late summer when the butterfly rig showed up. I'll never make back the coins I spent on it. And, I don't get much return, even at these values for bitcoins, but I've got it and its not useful for anything else. 
This weeks price spike was old times.  It isn't change my behavior at all. 
What does the future of Bitcoin hold for you? Do you plan to stay invested or sell when you feel the price is right?
I figure the future right now is brighter than it's ever been. I don't plan to sell anytime soon. If it goes up another 10 times from here, I'll sell off a portion of what I have, but most of it is waiting for the moon or the ground. 
If more local stores were to accept Bitcoin, which currency do you think you'd use more, Cash or Bitcoin?
Cash. I have lots of things I'd love to spend money on if I had much more than I have, but few things I have to spend money on that I don't have to spend. For me, bitcoin is a long term Hail Mary. Right now, I feel good about the long term prospects, but I don't have any cash invested, just mined electricity. 
In your opinion, will Bitcoin ever reach the point of being a widespread currency used in most countries?
I really doubt it. I think it more likely that the value will be in things layered on top of the bitcoin protocol and in transfers of money. As a day to day thing, it's cash. There's convenience for that, but it's not going to replace people living beyond their means with credit--because you can't live beyond your means with bitcoins. And, like cash, it's irreversible. I'd have no problems paying for an irreversible cup of coffee or groceries, but I would have qualms paying for irreversible, expensive electronics online. 
It's a substitute for using your ATM card at the register, not your credit card. 
But, I do think the potential for colored coins and other game changing features still has long term value. 
For the most part, it would seem the majority of the Bitcoin community is friendly and generous, why do you think that is?
I think that may be a selection bias of viewing the community through here. I bet more and more of bitcoin will concentrate in Wall Street or other financial centers and won't be controlled by friendly an generous owners. 
When you first heard about Bitcoin, did you honestly believe anything would come of it?
I thought it was a small possibility. I didn't think it would look as established as it is today by this point on time.

I agree with your general numbers. I do think it seems overvalued for this point in its adoption curve. I also think that the next year will see innovative features layered onto the protocol. That should increase its value, if not bitcoin's price. 
I also think we will see more Wall Street money moving in, which will probably increase bitcoin's price, if not its utility. 
The analysis confirms what nearly everyone says, only put in money you can afford to lose.

Santoshi's original paper talked about the possibility of further subdivision if the need arose. And, if you are suggesting anyone would seriously fight bitcoin by making everyone holding it richer, I'm not sure you've thought it through. 
Let's say you take the price of one santoshi to $100. That doesn't stop it being used in bank transfers, but does stop you buying a cup of coffee with it. That means anyone holding one coin has $10,000,000,000. That's 10 billion. And you'd need many multiples of that 10B to raise the value that high--and all that cash you spent in doing so would go to people probably still holding btc with an interest in its success. 
A more likely way to work it would be to crash it by dumping coins and buying more to repeat. If you have money to burn and want to fight directly, that would be a better way to go. I'm not so sure that will work in the long run either. 
As big trading money starts to get behind it, and it will, those folks will take advantage of either scenario, and will likely stabilize the price in the process. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:50:01
There are 2^256 private keys, which is roughly 10^77. 
There are estimated to be [about 10^80 atoms in the observable universe]( 
10^80 / 10^77 = 10^3 or 1000. So, if you could somehow use the entire universe as your storage system and encode each unique key in 1000 atoms, which considering you need 256 bits is possible, then you could store all the keys. 
But, I can tell you that I'd object to you using my atoms. 
Of course, then you need some atoms to run the system to process your data. 
Plus, there is the time you would need. The mining of bitcoins is currently around 1 petahash/second. That's 10^12 hashes per second. Call it 32 million seconds in a year and that's 10^12 x 3.2x10^5 = 3.2 x 10^17 hashes per year. 
Now producing a private address and checking it is much less intensive than calculating a block, but you're not going to get that kind of computing power at your disposal. 
So we have 10^77 keys and let's say we can check 10^18 per year. That means we would need 10^59 years to check all of them. The universe is thought to be around 14 billion years old. That's 1.4 x 10^10. You would need more than 10^49 times the age of the universe to check all the private keys. 
If you have the capacity to store that kind of data and the time to run the calculations, the value of the entirety of bitcoins is so insignificant compared to what you could do that you wouldn't bother. 
EDIT: fixed some typos and adding
Of course, if you used a brain wallet to generate your private key and you used an English phrase for it, it will take much less time and storage, which is why you can find find posts about people losing coins stored in brain wallets.

Very interesting. I knew of m of n and had thought of it as escrow. This made me look differently at it. 
I'd also thought that one of the impediments to bitcoin adoption was that it was so much like cash. I have no qualms making an irreversible transaction for a cup of coffee. 
I'd have few qualms buying a large appliance at my local retailer for cash or bitcoins because I have avenues of redress I feel confident in. 
I'd have tons of qualms about paying for an expensive item irreversibly on eBay.  Here's a way for eBay to learn to stop worrying and love bitcoin.  They set themselves up as the arbitrator for btc on eBay. They still get their excessive cut and people will feel more comfortable using bitcoin. 
Of course, now they can't hold the funds for their benefit. 
Could you use scripting in bitcoin to deal with the situation where the abitrator refuses to rule? Let's say A has a 2 of 3 transaction sending coins to B. C goes off the grid and there's a dispute. X bitcoins are tied up. 
Would it be possible to create a rule that says A and B agree to the 2 of 3 transaction only if B sends X/2 coins to an address controlled by A. 
Both of them may feel screwed, but if its a substantial sum tied up in a transaction that will never complete, it's a way to get some btc back.
