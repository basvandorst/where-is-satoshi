So 2 people and you riot.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:49:22
I just imagined that and ended up laughing my ass off. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:22:58
It is. If Doge rises, bitcoin will probably rise too.

No. Bitcoin used OpenSSL for RPC and such.
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:37:50
Yeah, that's kinda what I assume would happen.
I also wonder how much x press other altcoins get. I think some coins just get attached onto the list of crypto currencies news people list, while some not so big coins get some news articles.

Because Heartbleed affected bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:25:55
This is most probably a troll account, stuff like this is all he posts

Are you seriously saying Shibecoin is original because it has a different logo?
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:29:46
[Your original argument was that they were going to 51% it.](

@_date: 2014-05-09 12:25:09
My argument was that there were only a few people who said such things.
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:18:10
@_date: 2014-05-09 11:26:20
One person != community.

[So dogecoiners can't argue for dogecoin while bitcoiners can argue for bitcoin?](
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:48:41
Wikibot, what is Back Orifice?
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:11:14
I want to see a chart displaying how many bitcoin articles are negative or neutral or positive compared to dogecoin. It would be interesting.
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:38:01
No, you're definitely arguing against the Dogecoin community. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 13:24:16
And how many people has Doge helped VS Bitcoin?
People who killed themselves over Bitcoin count negative.
@_date: 2014-05-09 13:08:34
What if I created a fork of Bitcoin called BinaryDigitCoin that had [this]( logo? And then advertised it?
Why do you feel the need to BinaryDigitCoin down? Are you trying to rile people up because you're afraid they'll be successful?
