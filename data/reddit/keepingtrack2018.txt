If it's the number one currency then you stop comparing it to fiat and it stops being so volatile. You borrow 1 BTC to buy a house for example and then make payments with interest. In the end you pay back 1.5 BTC for example.
I'm not sure if BTC will be so successful or if this is what success even looks like for BTC.

Anyone who spends 15 minutes looking into Epstein's case knows that Western governments are run on blackmail and corruption.
I think it's safe enough to say the bulk of governments are, generally.

If by focus, you mean talk and tweet, then hedge, then reverse his position entirely or drop the subject a week later, you're probably right.

Mostly forming corporations or trusts that I theoretically have access to but cost a flat rate to perform and so don't work at a small scale.

I'll believe that when I see Trump's wall and Obama's working healthcare system. Which should be coming right after Bush accomplishes our mission in the Middle East and Clinton doesn't have sexual relations with that woman.

Maybe you're already aware and making the point subtly, but: the Uighurs and Tibetans are being genocided. China has a 'president for life'. They are militarizing the South China Sea. There are probably more parallels I'm not aware of.

Why are you so fixated on my race? Can you tell me what ethnicities are qualified to criticize which governments?

Between McCain and Obama, where is the merit? What about Kerry and Bush? Or HRC and Trump? I've written in Ron Paul a couple of times (real winner right there, merit and a nice voice), but never received the competent leader you assert I should have received.

Don't forget to live once in awhile. Go ahead and spend the money to see a play, go camping, or get some books.
The flip side is that you pour everything into crypto and lose it. In that case you'd have been better off visiting Mt Fuji or collecting motorcycles. 
Consider living well a hedge ;)

Tibetans and Uighers are non white, if that means you care about them?
Are you unable to separate a condemnation of government policies from a condemnation of an ethnicity?

The official name of Taiwan is Republic of China. The vast majority of Taiwan's population are ethnically Han Chinese. I see no evidence that he's from the tiny minority of indigenous Taiwanese other than 'parents born in Taiwan, so Taiwanese'.
By that logic, 'Yang born in America, so Cherokee'.
I would be sincerely interested in evidence to the contrary.

Reposting a single link to a dubious website doesn't make it more credible or convincing. I'll post my link twice though, if that's what constitutes proof for you.

Real talk: because TPTB know that a certain amount of Americans will consume left wing fake news, radicalizing them against center right Americans (Antifa). Just as they know a certain amount of Americans will consume right wing fake news, radicalizing them against center left Americans (they're waiting on jackbooted brownshirts but we're not there, yet). When things get chaotic enough that'll be their excuse to tighten down control with an expanded patriot act.
This globalists offer a fake choice between conservatism and liberalism. Americans want fiscal liberalism (healthcare, pensions, workers rights) and social conservatism (law and order, cohesive communities, support for families). They run back and forth between the politicians who promise this future and but deliver only fiscal conservatism (deregulation, corruption, corporate control) and social liberalism (immigration, child drag queens, feminism). Every attempt to get out of this just takes us a step further into �� ��
The rule with propaganda is, if you're seeing it, it was made for you.

It seems our contention comes down to you dismissing my claims on the basis that, 'only racist white people would criticize China'. Where does that belief come from? Surely some Tibetans might have criticisms of China? Or South Koreans? Are they all racist white people?
Maybe it'd be more appropriate to attack the veracity of my claims than presume a character defect from the outset.

If you don't already know, you should look into the French WW1 uniforms. They were basically unchanged from the Napoleonic era. Very cool. Very easy to spot through the sights of a German machine gun.

Are you guys really that salty they added BCH as an option? You're really calling that manipulation when it says "Bitcoin Cash" right there? If I'm missing something let me know but that's all I've seen.
And in regards to your question for me, do you expect there to be a LN straight from my address to the vendor's? Wouldn't there be at least some on chain fees for a payment like that?
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:05:02
Gotcha. So this fee they add, is it due to them not having implemented LN and calculating your fee without it or are they adding profit margin to BTC but not BCH?

Aww I like it here :(

If some miners stop difficulty is adjusted down programmatically and profitability increases.
You can use Google to answer your own fud.

@_date: 2018-03-18 18:42:57
Ok yea that seems shady. I see their need for profit but take a percentage off the top of all transactions equally or according to the difficulty of offering that payment method.
@_date: 2019-09-07 07:37:27
I'm surprised by the relatively low adoption in France and Western Australia. Anyone know why it's lower there?
@_date: 2019-09-14 05:24:50
This isn't how the mining difficulty works. It will scale back down if the hashpower drops.

Bitcoin will reach $1 mil through the devaluation of the dollar. Meaning, everyone who didn't buy BTC will be very poor, and your lifestyle will only be slightly worse than it is today.
