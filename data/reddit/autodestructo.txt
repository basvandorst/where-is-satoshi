Post WW2 during the reconstruction era, and amid the burgeoning "Cold War", a huge amount of the American economy switched gears. We solved the problems of post war unemployment by having the federal government print a bunch of money and pay people to work for the armed services in one form or another. Everything from the development of the modern air travel industry to the space race to the standards of the highways system was dictated and paid for by the so called U.S. "military industrial complex". Ever since then huge numbers of congressional districts rely on government contracts, subsidies, and grants to function and there's a huge pressure on congress to justify continued or new spending in these areas even though we mostly don't need them. Projects like the famous "bridge to nowhere". Or the entire NASA SLS program, which is basically a bunch of pork-belly nonsense no one wants. People gotta get paid, though.
So for ~70 years the U.S. intelligence and military communities have been working abroad as an interventionist force. Trying to create conditions more favorable to U.S. companies. When it started, this was mostly a *stabilizing* force. But now, it's mostly a *destabilizing* force. It creates conflict where there is none, which is just fine in the eyes of congress because it rationalizes the spending they want/need. 
Put bluntly, the value of the U.S. dollar is based on fear and unsustainable growth. Threaten that and you threaten an ecosystem that will react with more fear and unsustainable growth.

If this turns out to be anywhere as widely adopted as "email" I'm all in.
I put "email" in quotes because it's just a bunch of vaguely related  protocols for getting messages back and forth, not a single standard. And so far, the crypto world looks the same.

Well, this is fuzzy math but I'll try to reason through why I believe it.
Over the last 150 blocks the average number of transactions is 2033.48, (based on data from blockexplorer.com) that means we really haven't diverged much from the ~2000 transaction limit of the 1MB block. It theory "block weight" should result in about 2x the number of transactions per block (if the whole network is using segwit) at the same difficulty target as today. So if today's transactions take an average of ~400 minutes to process (based on data from blockchain.info) then we might expect the same volume to transfer in only 200 minutes and incur a smaller transaction fee. 
Of course this is fuzzy math for a few reasons. 
1. You might see TX fees stay level as people pay for shorter TX times, it's perfectly up to what users are willing to pay.
2. People might be willing to make more small transactions when fees go down, pushing TX time back up.
There's a push-pull of market influence that should always keep fees just below the max people feel comfortable paying for them.
I'm really not sure what the correlations between transaction time, fee, and backlog size are.
So there really need to be more segwit transactions AND eventually bigger blocks AND off-chain settlements like LN that will reduce the number of transactions. Even then BTC can't scale to every day use for all the world's people. It's just intended to be a place to stick large sums of money, while some other system / coin is used for retail transactions or microtransactions.

Yeah, I'm that dumbass that deposited $1000 to my USD wallet the day before Thanksgiving. I had run out of leftover turkey long before I could buy. :/

A. This shouldn't matter because that same TX fee gets smeared over multiple transactions.
B. For LN to work the majority of the network must be using segwit, which would clear the transaction log (at today's volumes) and reduce fees anyway.

I'm not sure how old you are but things aren't the best or worst they have ever been. There were two HUGE credit bubbles in the 90's and again in the 00's. The first was personal loans and credit cards, the second was mortgage and mortgage insurance. Given the chance, people in the U.S. will live well beyond their means for various reasons and it has been like that for a while, going back at least to the Regan administration. This has put pressure on everyone to live beyond their means just to feel like they're status-quo.
At the same time we've reached a critical point in logistical infrastructure in the last few decades. A car used to be a large, long term investment because they were "durable goods" and more money went into maintaining them than making them. As engineering, manufacturing, and shipping costs have all come down proportionately cars are now cheap and interchangable. Think "car as a capital investment" versus "car as a service". It's not just cars, either. Nearly everything in wide ciculation has undergone this change, we are now a much more truly "disposable society".
Very few people can do everything in cash, and it actually doesn't pay in most instances. Big purchases like a house or vehicle help you get ahead and make more than they lose in the long run. The issue is that a lot of people are uneducated about credit and use it indiscriminately.

This is hardly DJIA. 4 investments, three are very closely related, and one is a currency manipulation scheme involving the company offering this product.
Hard pass.

Stock wattage, clocks ~1950 - 2050, allowing the cards to manage them. This is a Folding rig, not mining. Precision is important and overclocking is bad.

The WannaCry ransomwear hit the NHS in Britain during April 2017  and was major international news. It asked for payment in BTC. Basically it was the first time several tens of millions had heard of it, price started building momentum like crazy.

People are more uninterested by and used to hearing the term "Internet" now than say, 25 years ago. I'm pretty sure that almost everyone does not "understand" it. I'm a network engineer and I'm pretty sure I don't know how most of it looks in practice. Knowing how to use it and knowing what it's doing under the hood are different things.

Exactly what cryptography was ever involved in eGold?
Did you write the password to your account down once with a decoder ring?
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:30:57
Yeah , now you've gotten into different territory. This points to a larger problem of people living far beyond their means, and a huge wealth gap. Banks like to perpetuate the former and are at least complicit in the latter.
In theory, more people using cryptos for more things should help reverse these trends,
In theory.

I have 3 1080's. 1 FE and 2 aftermarket. The FE is by far the quietest and most reliable in temps at 87% utilization 24/7 while Folding. I'd buy a truckload of them if I could.

Yeah, that's why I gave a range. "They manage themselves". I haven't changed the base clock on them up or down, they just sort of do their thing. I just set a fan profile so they'll stay ~75C in the room they occupy.
Funny thing about 1080's is that in general they perform about as well out of the box as they ever will. I've got two on water in my other computer and they won't go past 2100MHz without overvolting, so I let them run at stock clocks as well. They stay nice and cool though, so when I'm willing to overvolt them I'll hopefully get more useful life out of them before they crap out.

Religion != Nationality, so no.
That's like trying to store a string in a float.

We're on the same page re: national citizenship.
In the comments above though, one person is talking about citizenship and the other religious affiliation; or more properly the religious connotation of a surname, which is even more abstract. So I think *they* are talking past each other.
