If a higher fee transaction is processed, then the other one will give an error if its ever processed. I don't exactly know what happens, but essentially nothing will happen.
If you can see your bitcoins on breadwallet, send them again with a higher fee.
Check  and see what satoshi/byte will get you a front row seat on the miners block.
Some say that around 3k transactions is the next block, so maybe try sending with a fee that will get processed in a few blocks.
Or... If it's not urgent, if it's cold storage, if you are not going to use this now, just wait.
It will either be processed sometime (the backlog clears, you'll see that on the site I told you to check) or it will be cancelled.
I had this problem the other day and solved it exactly this way (higher fee transaction)
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:42:13
use case is:
Btc on ledger nano s. Then someone forks btc, and I want to claim those coins. Move BTC to next receiving address, then use iancoleman bip39 to derive pvtkey of old addresses to claim forkcoins.
I only use xpub on sentinel (android), but I can get rid of that to reduce risk of exposure, since I will most probably use an android wallet (coinomi,bitpie) to send the forkcoins.
See any holes in this strategy?
Thanks for the answer btw.

The mempool has a size limit, in megabytes, but think of it as something that holds 250 thousand transactions. Lower fee transactions are taken off the mempool if it "overflows", so when they are not on the mempool, it's as if they didn't exist, so you can send the higher fee one.
Some people say that in 14 days transactions get cancelled, but they are rebroadcast, so I have yet to see this happening. 
Check this transactions:
Lower fee: 
Higher fee:
The lower fee one can only be seen on this block explorer. Other ones don't see it anymore, but this one keeps a long record.
The lower fee was the first transaction. When I sent the second one, it was marked as "doublespend", but when it got mined before the first one, it was not a doublespend because the miner could not see the first one.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:52:42
imagine address 1 has 2btc.
when someone forks bitcoin, it means address 1 now has 2btc on the bitcoin network and 2 forkcoins on the forkcoin network.
When you send bitcoin from address 1 to address X, only the bitcoin moves. Now address X has 2btc on the bitcoin network, address 1 has 0btc. On the forkcoin network, address 1 still has 2forkcoins and address X has 0forkcoins.
So to spend forkcoins you need the private key (paper wallet) from address 1, and to spend btc you need the private key for address X.

No need to. We will see it perfectly clear when they decide.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:43:35
Its not like that.
If you spent from a paper wallet, then the old address/pvt Key has the fork and the New addresses has the BTC.
Since there are lots of forks, you should always keep old pvtkeys in case of forks.

Unconfirmed transactions are the ones that have not been "processed" because they have low fees. They might process if the backlog (mempool) of transactions reduce size, or they might never process.
The bitcoins are on the original address until transactions are mined. 
Research for a bit how this works.

Any unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:18:29
Depends on a few things. Did you send the bitcoins from the ledger?
Basically the wallet that sent the transaction should send it again with a higher fee. Sometimes it is not possible because some wallets see the unconfirmed transaction and prevent a newer one being made.
Try synchronizing stuff again, or maybe restoring wallet, or maybe importing the keys on another wallet. The secret here is that when the bitcoins appear on the original wallet, you can choose a higher fee to have it processed (mined) before the other one.

Don't know if I misinterpreted your tips on using diceware words, but if I did not, I don't agree with it.
diceware can be used on a dictionary attack, and as a 4 or 5 word passphrase can be quite long, it can give the impression of a very secure passphrase, but it really is not that strong since dictionary attacks are way more efficient (in your video of bruteforcing you gave an example of the word internationalaccessoriesuniversity, three tokens that can be found in a day).
In my opinion, its better to take a not-so-long group of two words, or even a big word, and change something in it to make it immune to dictionary attacks. Check it against common leaked password lists like rockyou.txt just to make sure that no-one has ever used it, and that's it.
from something like "amazingmustang", create a passphrase like "amazyngmoost4ng", and make sure to memorize it, and to memorize the difference that you created (amazing with an Y and mustang with moo like a cow and a number 4 instead of the A on mustang).
The goal here is to create a passphrase that does not use dictionary words, so it needs to be bruteforced, and bruteforcing a 10, 12, 15 char password is hard. You must create a storage plan for your passphrase as well, and that should be a different one than the one that stores your seed words.
I know that this is kinda opposite advice to your "keep it simple, no spaces, diceware words and no symbols" advice,  but that is my opinion really.
Can you by any chance do a test using the diceware words, on passphrases like three, four or five words ?
Cheers. Appreciate your effort to inform, educate and try to help people out. I am in constant search of ways to improve seed storage and now passphrase security as well (I was using a 5 letter passphrase with the substitution method mentioned, and because of your tests, I will increase the lenght or it can be bruteforced).

I tried reusing the same address for a paper wallet, and found out that it does not save fees. I had four deposits on this same address, and the spend transaction has four inputs, all of the same address.

This, or I am doing something wrong.

Its always 24 words to restore.
Then you go on the menu and add the 25th one to access wallet 2, or 3, or 4.
Because of this, it is recommended to keep like 500, 1000USD on the main wallet (1), so if someone spends it you will know that your seed has been compromised. They will not get access to your wallet 2 because they don't know the 25th word, because you are smart and did not write it down.

bitcoin-qt is out of the question. But this have got me thinking: If I can get to the legacy address from the p2sh-segwit (it starts with 3) to make a transaction, the transaction will be sent using the legacy address, therefore paying full price on fees. Am I right?
If that's the case, then I can say that there's absolutely no benefit on using a segwit paper wallet nowadays, until there's a way to directly send this transaction using a segwit private key.

All passphrase wallets are final and do not disappear or vanish.
What is temporary is the ACCESS to that wallet. Ledger has two ways of accessing passphrase wallets:
A temporary one, in which you type the chosen passphrase and it opens the wallet on the ledger until you unplug it, or a more permanent way of accessing it thru a second PIN number that is linked to that other passphrase.
But you can have 10, 20, 1000 different passphrases on top of the same 24 word mnemonic, and all of those are permanent and will not vanish.

Lets avoid confusion:
When a fork happens, it's recommended to move your BTC to a new wallet/address only if you want to use your private key to access the forked coins. The reason for that being that once you use the private key on the forked coin network, it can be exposed to something.
So moving your BTC to a new wallet now is only a part of the process. You will still have your BTC on a new address, and you can use your old private keys to access your forked coins on their respective network.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:53:57
"paper". I do pdf's of paper wallets, inside an encrypted Veracrypt file. This file is secure, as long as the password is never online.
I open it on a live ubuntu usb bootable, and scan the private key using an android wallet, just to do the transaction. As soon as it's sent, wallet gets deleted on android, and the paper wallet is never reused.
So what do I get with this setup:
- If someone comes across only my password, he cannot use a standard wallet to restore it.
- If someone comes across my Veracrypt file, he cannot brute force it, so it's safe enough to have a backup online.
- You need both the password and the file, so in a way I think this is even more secure than saving your seed from a hardware wallet. Of course USING the bitcoins is a bit trickier and I have to be a bit more careful, but it's enough that I feel safe.

I am not a big fan of having to keep the master seed of hardware wallets stored. Even if you keep it somewhere safe, someone can still get to it and have access to your funds. So this is my setup:
*1) Live-usb ubuntu, network disconnected. *2) Generate addresses using bitcoin paper wallet downloaded offline site, printing PDFs. *3) Save these PDF on an encripted container using veracrypt, with a very strong password. This encripted file you can store safely online on google drive or something. *4) Split your BTC across some addresses, thinking of how you'll use them. Keep the public addresses handy. *5) When you want to use it, just boot ubuntu again, open the PDF, and use a mobile phone wallet like Mycelium to import the private key using QR Code. *6) Spend the amount needed and send the remaining amount to a new paper wallet and don't use the old one anymore.
Edit: never type the veracrypt password anywhere but the ubuntu live cd and dont store it online.

I don't think is this. For me, this is coming from the miners.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:45:44
Yes they do. check 
If there a million transactions on the mempool, and they go up to 800 satoshi/byte, if miners can include only like 20.000 transactions on a block, they will include the ones with higher fees, so if this million of transactions are just spam, you keep being forced to pay higher fees, or your low fee transactions are just going to stay among the spam and will never be mined.

You don't forget it, you write it down and store it safely, preferably in two or more places.
You may ask how is this different from the seed for a Trezor/Ledger. Its a password for a file. If you have the password but not the file, you have nothing. This does not happen with seeds from wallets, because they can be used to recover a wallet to a fully operational state.

Password allows access to private keys, but the password is never stored with the actual encrypted file. And the password alone is not a recovery seed, so if someone sees it, he will still need the encrypted file to do something.
My main issue with hardware wallets is: How do you safely store your seed? Of course, you can split it and keep half of it @ your house and half somewhere else.

It wipes the device. You always restore the device using only your 24 word (main wallet), then after you are done, you set up the passphrase access (hidden wallet).
So... if you mistype PIN  or  three times, it wipes your Ledger configuration, along with your wallet, as if you had just bought it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:52:57
Imagine the "wallet" as being a physical wallet. You can have lots of slots, separations, compartments. The wallet generated from your mnemonic seed is the whole wallet, and that wallet supports all coins, and all variations of that (segwit, legacy, bcash, altcoins).
When you add a passphrase you get a second wallet. Entirely.
I encourage you to test it out with bitcoin testnet. Reset your ledger (after doing the backups OF COURSE), create a new wallet with a new 24 word seed, receive some testnetbitcoins there, then create the passphrase one and access it. Your balance will be zero. THen receive some testnetbitcoins there, unplug the ledger and go back to your main wallet to see the amount there, then go back to the passphrase one and check the different balance.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:44:51
Correct me if I am wrong, but using Segwit in this case with a 75sat/byte does not result in a better transaction preference than a regular transaction using 75sat/byte, right?
You do pay less total fee because it's less bytes, but it will be chosen by a miner the same way as a regular transaction with the same fee/byte.
Is this right?

On top of that, you have the usual 20 to 30 thousand legitimate transactions, that are forced to use &gt;800 sat/byte, so the miners get blocks full of transactions with this amount of fees.
They benefit from mining the high fee transactions, that is just the point. 99% of what's not going to be processed is the low fee ones.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:13
Do you really think this is 'as intended'?
So if they keep pushing the mempool to higher limits, it's 'as intended'?
Imagine tomorrow, or in a month, that when you want to send a simple 1 input 1 output transaction, that it will cost you 0.2, 0.5 or 1btc.
Do you think this is 'as intended' ? Or do you think there should be a way to stop this behavior?

Always make sure of what you do. I always use the Bitcoin testnet to ensure that I can restore wallets back after a reset, including the 25th word wallet. Just install the Bitcoin testnet app from Ledger Manager and get some Bitcoin from testnet faucets.

@_date: 2017-12-27 10:00:16
You can have as many as you want. Each one is a different wallet. Ledger allows you to set up a second PIN to access a second wallet, but there's also the temporary passphrase option that allows you to access any other passphrase wallet. Difference is that you have to type it choosing character by character on the Ledger, and that takes a bit longer. But I think it is a very nice option that allows you to have wallets for your kids, for example, completely separated from your main one and your hidden one.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:30:09
Not a word from the list, It can be whatever you want, even a complete phrase with spaces. You would have to suspect It exists and know How to brute force It. For me, It is secure enough. Just something to protect someone from accessing your recovery seed.

You create a Channel with a known other party (imagine a friend or a Hub like a Starbucks ir whatever). Then you put an amount like 0.1 BTC on that channel. Setting up the Channel is a transaction on the blockchain, that pays a fee and takes a while to process. After that, you can send bitcoins to Anyone that uses the same Hub (like paying a friend or for a coffee). This transaction is instant and fee-less or Very little fee (dunno that). If you dont spend ALL that you put in the Channel, its returned If you close It.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:11:19
Problem is they don't spend it, because these transactions never get mined.
Spam is just the word used. It would me more appropriate to use something like "inflating the mempool" or something like that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:26:04
Dude, his right to spam is not moral! You have the right to spam the network also, the same way as anyone else. Having the right, in this case, is being able to send a transaction thru a node and it being included in the mempool.

Edit: I just saw now that you know about the bip-39 passphrase. Still leaving this here to give people ideas.
You should research about the bip-39 passphrase. It acts like a 25th word of your seed, but its not necessarily a word from the bip39 list. Can be something like grandmajohnson or something like that. 
Basically it creates a "hidden" wallet based on your 24 word seed. It has completely different addresses, and cannot be traced. There are no traces that it exists on the main seed.
How I use it: I store my 24 word seed hidden, but its readable and useable if someone finds it. I keep a small amount of BTC on it, and I monitor the balance on it. If balance changes, someone has found the seed, and its time to move my funds. I keep 99% of the funds on the hidden 25th word wallet, and I NEVER write down that word. Only me and my wife know it.
This allows me to have more than 1 wallet on my seed. I have one for a friend, and he knows the word too. I have one for my father, and he knows the word to that. NEVER write it down, not on a computer, not on a paper, no matter how hidden it is.
Also, because you are not writing it down, keep it simple. You don't want to remember something like $
To the people that will say that wallets can be brute forced, yes, they can. Only if the attacker knows you have a hidden wallet there.
Also you can use your splitting method together with this.

@_date: 2017-08-23 17:38:47
Questions:  
*1) Was the plan to double the block size a part of the NYA?  
*2) If it was, what's the problem on doing it, besides increasing storage space for nodes?  
*3) As of now, about 67% of nodes run core, and about 2% run btc1 client. When it is fork time, miners (90% signal new york agreement, segwit 2x support) will stay on the 2% chain, and a small amount of other miners will stay on the core chain. This will create a fork of BTC and another coin, lets call it B2X. BTC will have problem adjusting to the new difficulty and be slow for a bit, and B2X will keep mining almost normally. At that moment, exchanges will have to choose what client/chain they connect to, is that it?  
*4) Can you please ELI5 the replay protection or lack thereof, just so I can understand what happens if I move coins?  
Cheers. Just trying to educate myself on what's coming.
Personally I don't see the 2mb increase as a threat on decentralization by increasing the requirements to run a node, because of actual storage technologies and blockchain size. I support what the majority supports, though, and I agree that transaction spam must be controlled.

Don't do it. There is a bug that is not allowing btc out of the wallet when you are finished testing. Got 34000 sats stuck there.
With that said, you have two options:
 Eclair wallet, bear in mind that you will need sats to open and close a channel.
 bitpie wallet: does not require you to open channels, because it is a custodial wallet (they hold the keys for the btc, just the lightning part). I was impressed with how fast and flawlessly it worked. I am considering it an option to hold small amounts to use on lightning without the need for opening and closing channels. Oh, you can RECEIVE via lightning too, without the need to have a channel with inbound capacity. Bear in mind that they hold the keys for the lightning part, but not the "normal wallet" part.

Blockchain is blockchain, and that is not a scam on any of those.
Sorry, but if you fall for bad links or whatever, I don't care.
Also, premining is a part of what the development team agrees upon the development of a coin. If you want to use it, you have to agree to that, so that is not a scam also.

@_date: 2018-04-19 12:48:20
My solution is a bit simpler than that: bip39 password. You have the seed on a paper, two locations, titanium, whatever. On that wallet, you have just a little bit of BTC, just so you know in case it gets compromised (or if someone threatens you to give them your BTC). But you have a hidden word,  that you and your wife alone knows, that itself is another entire seed. You never write this word, ever. Keep it simple so you don't risk losing it, don't go all like r0kkeFf$le!!9s892.;?, just create something that only you two know, that makes sense, like richforever, paris1982 or WHATEVER. Just never write it down, ever. Nobody but you will know you have that, so you don't risk it being bruteforced. If you have kids that are not ready to handle this type of confidence, you can try writing the word down on paper and give it to a relative, with instructions to give it to your kid in case something happens to both of you. Write some basic info on what that word is, just so it can be put together with the seed that another relative will provide. These two relatives cannot know of each other.

The hard part now is mostly exchange-related, in my opinion. When you have BTC, spend BTC, earn (salary) BTC, things get easier. Security-wise it stays the same, seed must be kept safely by user.
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:05:07
It depends. If you do all the ones after bcd, you can get about 1.5% more BTC. If you only have a little, it may not be much in terms of USD value, but as I sold for a 40000 BTC customer, he got literally million+ of dollars from forkcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:18:24
you need to research some more about the bip39 password.
It works like this.
You have a seed, 24 words, okay?
Think of the bip39 password as a 25th word for your seed. But it creates entirely different addresses, its another wallet entirely.
Ledger and Trezor support this, so in the end you have two PIN numbers, one access the "regular" wallet from the 24 word seed, and the other one access the "hidden" wallet from the 24 word + 25th word.
The single word is not the entire seed, you still need the 24 words, but it provides the additional security features:
1) If your seed is exposed to someone, say the cleaning lady, she will only have access to your main wallet, because she does not now that there is a hidden wallet. You can monitor your funds, and if your funds move, your main wallet has been compromised and you should move your hidden wallet funds.
2)  An attacker that demands via physical violence that you give him your BTC can think that you only have the BTC that is on the main wallet, because he does not know you have a hidden wallet. If you keep "reasonable" funds on the main wallet, you can say that you sold your btc and all you have now is that.
3) As for the security of this single word, for it to be vulnerable to brute forcing, people must know that you have a hidden wallet on that seed, so that is the main security point. You can, if you want, make it whatever size you want, but remember: As it should not be written anywhere, you should not make it error-prone.

Will stop being complicated when fiat is out of play. WHen people start receiving their salary on BTC and spending BTC.

I like johoe because you can visualize if txs are piling up because of block time variance or high usage. Also helps to "zoom out" and check last 8, 24h, 7d, 30d.
mempool.space is very cool though

BTC is going up in value, while all others are going down.
