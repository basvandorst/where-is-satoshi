The blockchain contains a transparent record of all transactions for each btc address.

You are entitled to your own opinion, sir; however you are NOT entitled to your own facts.  Learn the theory behind the blockchain, understand the math, then read and understand the code base of bitcoin and a 2nd gen implementation of the blockchain, ie etherium for example.  By that time you will quite readily see why your "opinion" resulted in an article of PR bullshit.

So lemme get this straight.  You have a wallet worth more than 15BTC, likely 60-90% more since common sense would suggest one would only offer between 10 and 40% as a reward for unlocking the wallet.  So the wallet is likely /actually/ worth between 37 - 150 BTC (25k - 100k USD) ..... and you lost the password.  Uh-huh.....riiiiiiiigggghhht.  Moreover, with a bit of clever work and understanding of the codebase, anyone who cracks it for you, could potentially "acquire" your wallet.  AND...whoever cracks it would be receive some pretty serious kudos from the cryptography industry, ie job offers, honorary degrees, a Fields Medal perhaps.   I'm calling shannigans.  You sir, are full of shit.

Really wish people would stop posting vaporware PR bullshit like this.  Quit diluting r/bitcoin with vacuous noise like this.  It's rapidly destroying any value r/bitcoin has.

If you know, then you understand that verifying your claim by providing the btc address is completely viable.  Avoiding doing so only further shades your claim as ...what was the word I used...oh yes, "shenanigans."  Provide the btc address and verify.

Perhaps you should read up on BIP38 encryption.  Do a little combinatorics.  You'll quickly see why this post is BS.  I suggest starting here:

Well. &lt;sarcasm&gt; Since you present such overwhelming evidence &lt;/sarcasm&gt;.  Easily enough verifiable.  Provide the bitcoin address.  ....lol....
