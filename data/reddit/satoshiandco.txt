The last few weeks in the markets, especially since the [launch of Libra,]( seen extreme price swings not seen since late 2017. The price of Bitcoin jumped by over 20% in the last few days, reaching a (local) high of $14k in price, and is currently trading in the high $11ks. 
While it is easy to start drawing comparisons between the current price rally and that of late 2017, underlying data seems to indicate that the recent purchasing activity is largely without retail investors; Retail was the key reason the price of bitcoin rose above $20k in the previous mega bull run.   
Here's an in-depth analysis of $BTC - it's price movement and trading volumes throughout 2019 amongst other crypto metrics. [
