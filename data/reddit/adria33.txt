If enough people believe it, we certainly can go up a lot, but it won't be sustainable. And the bigger the money, the smarter it tends to be, which in turn doesn't mistake a bubble for a ball or a ball for a bubble.
If you do the former, you'll sell too soon (it'll keep going up... (or not buy at all)), and the latter you'll buy too late (it'll pop.... (or not sell at all prior)). And I think we're still in ball phase - mini corrections all the way up to bubble phase, but that bubble threshold is rising too (with every piece of good news) so I can't give it some value.
It'll be hard for people right now who were ready to buy in &lt;400 due to bad China news (which may still happen).. but with that impact unknown anyway. I suppose one must learn some lesson and act like a computer.

Tipping is a financial transaction, for something received or expected. Advertising is sending a message about something to elicit a financial transaction later. 
I don't how the article connects tipping with advertising. I think ChangeTip are still trying to work that out. So how does a tip lead to a larger purchase later? The article doesn't explain that.
There is however  which has been linked to the future of advertising where you get free coins while viewing a message (presumably advertising) although how do you know if people read or care about the message? (they just want the coins; or the coin amount is so low the tip is meaningless or insulting; and how can you ensure people will use the app)

Once orders spillover from the dark pools, prices will climb. Expect ultra high net-worth individuals to fuel the next big spike, not so much as an investment, just as an easy way to transfer and hold large sums of money. As the ecosystem complexifies, it makes more sense for them to do this, as in the past it's been hard to cash out large sums. The potential downside is capital-loss, but there is upside too. Also, corporates following ebay's lead will want some reserves before implementing any btc systems to capitalize on any gains. The interesting thing is if/when other crypto holders consolidate into bitcoin, or bitcoiners rather move out... I suspect there'll be consolidation into bitcoin.. and this could also fuel another rise. Not sure how compelling bitcoin is at point-of-sale but it needs to happen and should... politicians in the US can accept bitcoin donations, so that'll make them think twice about being openly hostile to it.
Thank Richard Branson and his pals for the next big rise... and any governments for pillaging bank accounts and running the fiat printing presses.

I think Draper's right. Although bitcoin to me is really a combination of:
1 - point-of-sale
2 - store-of-value
3 - alternate global currency with low fees
4 - enabler of more efficient b2b business processes 
One should see it in totality. But lowering barriers-of-entry is important to getting it to where it's needed most, as Draper says. 4 is important when starting to do business with these countries, so business systems should start to incorporate bitcoin into their processes (note: Oracle.) And after that, the benefits can move into more established markets in the West with the new software add-ons developed to do so.

there is the risk of inflation with regards to fiat. I mean, if the value of bitcoin rises with the level of inflation, then that's a desirability that fiat doesn't have and can offset those current usability downsides. Also, some people might not want their name attached to transactions, but also might not want to carry cash.. bitcoin is a solution to that.
For large transactions, I cannot think of any other payment system that allow for anonymous payments except bitcoin, when cash is unwieldly.

Wow, that's pretty smart. The company can sell off its shares (or issue them) to buy updated mining equipment when it needs to. As such, it can distribute more dividends, rather than keep them for reinvestment in mining equipment or pay power bills. It could also distribute back btc as dividends to shareholders. With an ETF, are you getting dividends?
It's also good for Australia, and foreigners can invest in it without being too concerned as to what happens or doesn't happen there. Chinese money can (hopefully) flow in that would otherwise be limited to buying btc back home. How are the Chinese authorities going to stop what DigitalBTC does with its dividends?

Tipping works if users are tracked, and certain tippers get special offers/services (like VIP consumers: bronze, silver, gold types.) So "tip" becomes a synonym for "join."

Even if they roll their own, code improvements can be pulled into bitcoin.

It'd make sense for Amazon or other large firms to buy up coins now behind closed doors, and then do an announcement later.. and make money off additional other large firms coming on board afterward.

I think he means manual inputting with those fields available.
This is a good idea. Imagine you are selling some bitcoins, you meet the person, they give you cash, then you ask to use their browser (or some browser nearby), and there is a form:
"send all bitcoins from one address to another address"
there are only two fields:
private key (because the source address can be determined from the private key)
destination address (the person gives that to you on the spot)
So the idea is to meet someone without needing a computer of any kind. Perhaps just a piece of of paper with your private key for the source address. You preload that address before you meet with all the bitcoins for the transaction.
You can also use that form to use with "bitcoin notes"... those notes will just have a private key and a url to goto for sending from. What'd be more tricky is having the amount change according to some dollar value instead of bitcoin amount - there'll have to be a change address that you preselect.

Yeah, also tipping is a good way to show social-proof - a new metric. Although, it's too easy to game tips (send them to yourself -- like purchasing your own books from a store to get on a best-sellers list, as Scientology has done, and Jay-Z has been rumoured to do.) In a way tips are meaningless, they really should be tied to a username to make it at least a little more useful.
Anyone trying to make a decent living collecting tips will struggle from that alone, although giving tips can generate enormous goodwill if done smartly -- look at Moolah, gave tips, promises and ultimately poor products but then ran off with subsequent investors' money. Tipping is still a work-in-progress, it'll be interesting to see how the apps develop.
 is an interesting site - collecting tips based on story submissions. But a Q+A site would be a better place to collect tips I think, as there is a need (and expectation) already established prior to the tip giving. Also, just because a person can tip someone doesn't necessarily mean they have their hand out or want it. It'd be rude to go up to someone in the street and say, here take this dollar for the cool shoes you're wearing. (Actually, that'd make an interesting app, haha)

BitLicense  should be about making business more transparent, and accountable, with taxation simpler and more honest - for firms of all sizes. The BitLicense seems to be about making it harder for crypto companies to do day-to-day business, and also more intrusive.
I feel that the opportunity that bitcoin offers businesses are for them to become completely transparent. All a firm's revenues and expenses are recorded in the blockchain, in publically declared addresses and as notes in the blockchain, but *names do not have to be recorded... only amounts.* When taxes are paid they are done in accordance with what has been publically stated.
For example, if you purchase something from some firm, the address you send coins to is stated on their website... or rather, the address is on the government website *and* the firm's website (with that page linked on the government's website.) Discrepancies can be detected automatically.
Also, in doing so, an audit-trail can be created between businesses. And there's some new tech here that could be created for inter and intra company bookkeeping.
And most importantly, government should be made more transparent and accountable too, in the same way. Its entire crypto tax department could "go transparent" at some point too.
Rename "BitLicense" to "CryptoClear" and it'd seem better. Otherwise scrap entirely. The issue at hand first and foremost is making taxation possible, but also more seamless using bitcoin, and enabling government to spend those bitcoins too.

Nomi Prins wrote a book released in April, 2014 - "All the Presidents' Bankers: The Hidden Alliances that Drive American Power " - maybe someone was worried about copycat books coming out, or they prevented them (authors, interviews, data.) Basic "terror of the man" is back in banking.
Surely some of these deaths were botched, and there is more information to reveal.

These guys should think about creating their own multi-currency wallet. Otherwise it's easy to forget they exist.

How about a "Tip with Shapeshift" button .. I could link to that from my soundcloud page.

Doge + Shapeshift.io FTW.

Yeah, instant settlement could be for lower priced items by certain sellers. Also, sellers could earn trust and gradually get better settlement terms, like with insurance ratings. I just don't see how Visa couldn't use cryptocoins somehow to ultimately lower their fees and provide a better service. It's not for clients to demand it as the CEO says, it's for the CEO to improve the business in large or gradual ways. This is basic management.

Or all the people using Adblock and Ghostery. Ads only capture a segment of the people you think are looking. What about the rest? (And those could block tip buttons too.) How do you make people *want* to pay but not need to?? That's the question.

or governments for taxes/licenses?

add: there's actually a site that seems to do this but in a much more comprehensive way, and claims to not require private keys... (and is open source)
"no trust needed: no functions require you to reveal private keys with all data available via https"

GoCoin - 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:26:38
Just add:
- user holds private keys 
- all open source 
and people will leave you alone

Any high profile sites that use BitMerchant please?

But also, at the same time it's hard to tell which of the "I hate cryptsy" brigade are legit and which are from competing exchanges just trying to scare people to their sites.

Also checkout  (although it has Quark)

It's quite slow. I've read 1 confirmation is significantly stronger than 0 confirmations, although some people consider 0 confirmations as a done transaction. To get 1 confirmation should take around 10 minutes, but in practice I think that can vary a lot, and that wait time makes using it stressful and unpredictable. 10 minutes is really not point-of-sale for most people on a regular basis. I'd expect 5 minutes to be considerably more acceptable in this instantaneous world (ideally 0.1 seconds.)
