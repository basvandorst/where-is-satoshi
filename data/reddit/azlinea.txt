I have a question: Why do you consider btc's exchange rate its 'real' value?
@_date: 2012-06-16 17:21:39
Mobile phone isn't smartphone though. Unless some people are working on flip phone access that number is kind of meh.
@_date: 2012-06-14 02:50:39
How does one measure the subjective value then?
@_date: 2012-06-15 03:04:23
Can we not use the term 'corporation' as, as far as I understand, these groups aren't incorporated and/or aren't licensed businesses.
No, its not nitpicking. There is a difference between a company and a corporation.

So then why do you pay taxes, court fees and fines then? All of these pay for justice to be done in modern western democracies. 150 dollars is much less than you will pay in taxes and court fees, not to mention lawyers, to have law.
And please define righteous because other than making you sound pretentious it means nothing to me.

You are using my property in a way I no longer condone...get off. This is what a landlord says when they evict someone. Its not aggression.
@_date: 2012-06-18 00:10:19


violence != aggression. Removal from property you don't own isn't aggression, at least not by the above definition.

Its a great example of how markets bring prices down so that more people can access a technology, which is amazing, but I am not sure I am excited by it so.


This is correct. And yet accessing the internet on a flip phone is more hassle than its worth because unless you are in Africa, and looking at an African site, the web isn't designed for you to see or use.
So unless you specifically develop websites for non-smartphones you have a significant barrier to entry, which is usability.

How does one determine the value of a currency?
@_date: 2012-06-14 02:03:05
Could make another *coin that provides this service, see how well it competes with bitcoin. The big issue I see is figuring out how much currency should be created and how to reward the submitter as well.

So far I have one question: If I have a server hooked up to a hocnet node can it be accessed through hocnet (but not necessarily through the internet)?

This sounds like all those compromising-politics people who say 'George washington and the founders didn't expect X'. It sounds like hero worship and doesn't actually put forward any issues, other than indirectly.
That being said:
* The issue of GPU mining is solved due to the difficulty rising to meet the comp. power. 
* Difficulty being high isn't a bad thing, creates a need for division of labor and for other people to be merchants instead of miners.
* I'm not sure what the issue with mining pools is...centralization?
@_date: 2012-06-16 17:16:17
Wow what? Proof and how did they tell them?
@_date: 2012-06-14 03:46:49
I understand what the word subjective means...I just don't understand how one builds a useful econometric based off subjectivity. Specifically without completely arbitrary numbers.
Like how does one measure how well a currency is accepted? The number of businesses that use it or the number of users? How do you measure liquidity, by pure volume or the price its traded at? What does security of use even mean?
Solidcoin tried this. It was kinda meh then and its kind of meh now. There issue was thinking that a finite currency was some how bad; yours was thinking that the trading value of btc to usd is actually important in the long run. Its not.

If you already have some sort of digital media you could check out [coindl]( although I am unsure of how trustworthy it is.
@_date: 2012-06-14 02:21:32


No I am telling you that you calling justice or law free makes you sound decidedly naive. Its not, get over it.


What is your definition of justice?
@_date: 2012-06-14 01:51:19
What do you think courtrooms and all accompanying furnishings are? Magical goodness? Plus the salary of judges and court clerks and everyone else that works there. These things are not free, you just don't pay upfront for them. There is a difference between the two.
@_date: 2012-06-14 00:02:22
Its a way to start a needed service, law production, on a small scale so you can make it on a larger scale. Someone below gave you the link to how arbitration is enforced but ultimately people are social animals and don't want to screw each other over, which is why conpeople and other nefarious forces can do so well for themselves as people don't expect it to happen.
No need to deride something just because you don't understand it.

There isn't much discussion to be had, difficulty changes every 2016 blocks and changes based on how quickly those blocks were made which is a function of hashing power...ASIC stands to punch up the hashing power significantly and therefore difficulty.
More importantly the more people who deem this a 'no-brainer' and buy one thinking they will get rich will simply increase the difficulty even more. Tragedy of the Commons like effect.
Edit: Apparently I just quickly rehashed everything [someone else]( said. Whoops.
@_date: 2012-06-14 01:44:41
Even for criminal law this should be the tagline; between taxes, court fees and lawyers, especially state appointed defenders, justice is anything but affordable.
@_date: 2012-06-14 02:01:47


While cool, this is distinctly different from linking the creation of currency to the processing of some problem.
On the other end, I suspect that there is something out there that could provide consistent problems that is also useful. Just unclear what it is.

Why does any company sell capital instead of just putting the capital to use themselves? 
* Because they don't have the expertise to do so.
* Because its better for them to be the sole provider of capital than to effectively force people to compete with them by withholding your *whatever*.
* They already had an established supply chain to utilize making this a better choice than others.
@_date: 2012-06-13 23:58:10
Why not?
@_date: 2012-03-02 03:21:16
Calling a lawyer might not be a solution but agreeing to an arbitrator or mediator should definitely be an option. One that I don't think a lot of people think of because they don't know its an option.
@_date: 2012-06-14 17:10:29
I've always wondered this when I see prices in btc match up with the conversion rate for some round USD number.
@_date: 2012-06-14 01:56:43
It would be better to make the verification process take less time like some of the other *coin groups have done. Basically make the average block time lower would be useful.
@_date: 2012-06-16 19:14:24
Huh, well at least you offered me an alternative so thank you. Sucks to hear they are being dicks, any issues with non-businesses though?
@_date: 2012-06-19 00:22:42
The landlord owns the property. They told you to get off. You didn't. If you had a trespasser in your house you wouldn't remove them?
I'm not saying you should go in and murder squatters, or even rough them up, but removing them is not aggression.
@_date: 2012-06-17 17:00:01
Now *that* would be amazing and exciting! And yes their point was definitely absurd but that is why other people exist; to fill in the holes in our knowledge.
@_date: 2012-06-14 00:25:01


This isn't true. Even trading a 'commodity' for a service or another commodity is taxable. Its considered bartering.
@_date: 2012-03-02 15:46:37
Exactly, all of us need to become businesspeople and push for (fair) arbitration of disputes not lawyers.
@_date: 2012-11-03 15:29:19
Market yourself as a mediator or arbitrator and this might actually be a neat service similar to BBB. As it is right now though there is little reason for a merchant to want to talk to you because you don't offer anything useful for advertising. But if you offer an arbitration subscription to merchants based on number of transactions per month and collect personal info the same way glbse did then you might have a shot. Hopefully you get this going because it would be nice to say 'see market provides'.

Not sure about phishing but the "rogue" is pretty easy to see why if its a reviewer of online pharmacies, organizations that are often grey market at the best of times, then people are probably flagging it because it is supporting an otherwise illegal activity. Just a guess though I will say I didn't click the link because I saw the nice red circle too.
