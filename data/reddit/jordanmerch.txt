I am somewhat hoping for a drop back to 8-9 k to average up
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:38:31
Just imagine what the price will hit when people actually start to learn what bitcoin is.. I predict a few large dropoffs in price in the future, but all while being on a massive uptrend. This is all just my opinion and there really isn't any proof to what I am saying but I believe bitcoin is the future, and even with my current .07 bitcoin I think we are in the early pioneering stages.

I think you should def diversify. I have way more hope in bitcoin than any of my stocks, but you should still spread the love.

just buy it, it's gonna be like 50k one day anyway 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:38:50
Technically, that's a jeep. Actually, it's just as cool and congrats.

trying to eventually own an entire bitcoin.. but every week $200 gets me less and less.. I'll be okay with a dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:50:32
would it be worth to send all my funds to coinbase on the fork day so I can get free bitcoin gold as well? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:23:59
I'm waiting for it so I can get me some more
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:20:09
it's fine 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:12:30
Yeah I'd buy this dip
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:32:48
I don't see why I can't just use the USD to buy things while I HODL the more valuable of the two for a nice retirement.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:13:45
I'm not gonna buy something that was worth $50 in bitcoin and then years later find out that I essentially spent $5000 on a toaster
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:00:00
I added some in at 3,000. Previosly @ 3.5k, 3.75k, 4k, 4.5k
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:37:43
I jsut hit .2! I'll see you soon
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:14:09
Okay but the example I used had no reference to replenishing my freshly used coins with new ones.

They are creating the dip so they can buy in. Just HODL, this shit is going to the moon.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:26:50
I sent about $160 usd at 10:30am and it still has 0/3 confirmations at 1:37pm
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:37:43
I jsut hit .2! I'll see you soon
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:25:17
waiting for a pullback like.. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:32:34
I don't sell it ;)
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:00:00
I added some in at 3,000. Previosly @ 3.5k, 3.75k, 4k, 4.5k

Just my opinion, I think the most bitcoin will ever be worth is 100k, I see 50k coins as very realistic when people actually learn what crypto and bitcoin are. the numbers that we have already hit considering the fact that people have no idea what this is is pretty impressive. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:47:06
usually it goes down right after I buy it 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:34:58
mine is taking forever right now
