Simply. Not. True. Read definition of "soft fork."
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:25:22
Yeah, increase first, then other stuff later... (crickets).

Stop saying what you WANT to do... JUST DO IT!

So you think the recent incidents of transaction spamming have just been testing for the aftermath of the coming HF?
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:56:56
Sounds like BU may fork, then bury the Core chain in transaction spam. What's the protection against that?
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:49:05
This is certainly NOT true in the event a majority of hashing capacity mounts a coordinated attack.
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:03:28
I see what you did there.

DOZENS have explained. A little reading will make you an informed bitcoiner in no time.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:17:25
Not if the competing chains have different consensus rules.

Since BTC value is on a tear, my wife insisted on a sit-down to learn about keys, passphrases, etc.

Yeah, but what the "big guys at the top" can do at the border on even the slightest of suspicion should terrify you. This needs to be stopped, not just ignored.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:57:41
Understood. That's why it remains just a fanciful showerthought and not a workable proposal.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:02:44
Great business start-up idea!
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:55:59
Yes, they can fuck up your life on any suspicion, regardless.

Thanks for this. Agreed, it doesn't mean anything in a practical sense, but just having this bill introduced suggests that the sleeping bear is waking, and that it is confused and afraid of what lies on the economic horizon.

You misunderstand. They don't seem to care if they can detect your coins, or if they are on your phone. They want to be able to say, "Do you have control in any manner of digital assets valued at or above USD 10,000?" Lie to them, and you are seriously fucked if they have any reason to doubt you, facts not withstanding.
