Quick translation:
The exchange rate for the new digital currency "Bitcoin" adjusted upwards north of the $1000 level after the online game producer "Zynga" experimented with using it.
Web game of the digital age "Zynga" posted a message on social network "Reddit" that the company began to offer the service of selling things in the game with Bitcoin in the 7 most popular games, for example, Farmville 2, CityVille, and Hidden Shadows.  Thus Zynga revealed that the experiment of buying and selling things in the game this time came about from the current favorable trend of Bitcoin that is spreading throughout the world at this time.
Thus the beginning of Zynga's experiment is helping to support the value of the popular online currency after the value declined from the fact that the central bank of China forbade using the famous digital money this past December The central bank of India also announced this month that it thought the loss of using Bitcoin that exists is very high [had a bit of trouble with this sentence].
These days the website which offers the service of buying and selling and exchanging currency "Mt. Gox" revealed the value of one Bitcoin to be the equivalent of $1093, which is up from the level of buying and selling during the end of the week before at the $900 per bitcoin level.  After the beginning of December last year Bitcoin charged up north of the $1200 level before dropping down to approximately $700 per Bitcoin because its use was forbidden by China.

I actually use the Olympics to explain Bitcoin to people.
* Block Frequency = every 2 years
* Mining = competing in an event
* Reward = Olympic gold/silver/bronze medals for a few lucky competitors
* Difficulty = depends on current capability of athletes
When people say things like, "Why can't I create a fake Bitcoin and spend it??" I bring up the Olympics and say, "Why can't I just create a fake gold medal and tell people I won?  Because it is easy to verify that you didn't win by looking at the records."  
I then explain that in order to get medals, you have to participate in the Olympics "network" and play by the rules.

Theoretically, yes.  A quickly-varying electric or magnetic field can't penetrate a mathematically perfect Faraday cage because the electric potential at the surface of the cage is equal all the way around.
Practically, I'm not sure how close to perfect it would be to be good enough to shield your electronics.  An actual wire cage with holes?  Maybe not good enough.  A solid box of copper with no holes?  Probably good enough.  A superconducting solid container?  Certainly good enough.

I can see why all these different groups are interested in Bitcoin except for Feminists.  Why?  Is fiat currency part of the patriarchy?

@_date: 2014-02-26 15:22:01
The radio wave that carries your cell phone signal depends on creating differences in electric potential at a particular frequency through space and time.
The Faraday cage theoretically holds the entire surface of the cage at the same electric potential, thus the external wave can't create differences in electric potential inside the cage.

Plummeting sales = layoffs.  Plummeting share price will make stock investors (i.e. the rich) feel poorer, so maybe they'll sell fewer Rolexes, but the rich don't purchase goods in proportion to their wealth.  Poorer households have more of their wealth in their house and in cash.


Doesn't matter who is owed - they are obligated to pay them back just the same as with any other creditor.  Generally the government organizations that invest in treasuries need the money for future obligations, i.e. Social Security.


So the Fed is assisting crony capitalism, giving 0% loans to banks so they can park them in risk-free treasuries while students pay a much higher interest rate.


So the Fed is printing free wealth for 1% of the population

With the rapid price rise I suspect that there was an increase in the rate of attacks, perhaps beyond what their current systems could handle.

I think we're seeing arbitrage.  
There was a huge disparity in price between the Chinese exchanges and the USD exchanges with the Chinese exchanges being much lower because you can't withdraw bitcoin and so are forced to sell and withdraw RMB.  There was also no indication as to when withdrawals would be allowed again.
Since the news came out that the Chinese government might allow bitcoin withdrawals to begin in June, I'm guessing some traders are selling bitcoin in USD and buying bitcoin in RMB in anticipation of being able to withdraw bitcoin soon.  I've noticed the price gap has narrowed in recent days although it is still sizeable since it represents the still-present risk regarding bitcoin withdrawals in China.

One theory I have is that Coinbase is facing massive hacking attacks from overseas.  
* I'm traveling overseas now and was not able to log into Coinbase at all.  Now I believe they were rejecting all login attempts from overseas.
* I tried resetting my password but they wouldn't allow it since they claimed to not recognize my computer (which I had previously used to login to Coinbase).
* Eventually I just got a 503 "SERVICE UNAVAILABLE" page for Coinbase, even when looking at the jobs page.  
* Out of desperation I tried logging in via a VPN with a US-based server.  Everything worked great after that.
I just now tried the Coinbase webpage and I'm still getting the 503 page over twelve hours later.  Tried it through the VPN and it worked fine.

It depends on the redemption rate.  Even fiat currency requires endless printing as bills are taken out of circulation.  And yes, fiat currency is horribly wasteful as well.


This is much more difficult but I admit it would be cool.


This is mostly for people who live in areas where electricity/internet is not readily available.  As Andreas Antonopoulos points out, bitcoin has a tough time competing with the world reserve currency - but it is great for countries that have a terrible currency.  This would give them an instant hard currency usable worldwide.
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:14:36
Ouch, that's a pretty big weakness.  
I suppose the first paranoid person who sweeps the funds would be the winner.

Have they responded yet?
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:15:45
That is a problem - but vendors dealing with bitcoin have to deal with this already.  I suppose tying it to paper notes makes it extra painful.

The best part is that, if the money were in bitcoin, there would be no need to move the money at all.
@_date: 2015-02-28 09:34:12
True enough.  The idea would be to be as good as fiat currency, maybe even a little better.  Think about how much counterfeit fiat currency is floating around.
@_date: 2015-02-28 09:33:06
I addressed this above - it's a noted weakness.  




If you are really paranoid, you could scratch off the private key and transfer the bitcoins before accepting the note.
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:31:42
So are dollars.
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:01:49
The centralized trust would only be for the creation of the notes.  Once the notes are in the wild, they would be fully decentralized.
Sure, the centralized producer might be storing all the private keys and thus would have the ability to steal the entire value of the currency - that's another weakness.
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:32:42
Here's my idea:
Create paper notes of various bitcoin denominations and put on the note both the public key (visible QR code) and private key (QR code hidden by scratch-off material).
Once the notes are created, pre-load the notes with the denomination indicated by each note, e.g. 500 bits, 1k bits, 5k bits, 10k bits, 100k bits, etc.  (Right now $1 USD = approx 4k bits.)
Via this method you can basically pass around bitcoin notes like paper money.
You can tell if a note has been compromised by (1) checking to see if the scratch-off material has been removed and (2) checking the balance via the public key.
It's possible that someone could use some sort of x-ray device to get the private key, give you the note, and steal the bitcoin later, but hopefully the note/scratch-off material would be good enough to fend off all but the most sophisticated/expensive attempts at hacking the private key.
People could also create "counterfeit" notes where they know the private key beforehand.  I suppose you could thwart this by checking incoming transfers to the public key on the note and see if it came from an "official" source.
You could also put only the public key on the note and store a central database of public-private key pairs.  This would make it immune to the x-ray attack, but the central store goes against the philosophy of bitcoin and also makes the central store vulnerable to attack.
Oddly, these kinds of notes would allow people to load MORE bitcoins onto the note.  Not sure what kind of problems this would cause...
The best part about this system is that this currency would be usable worldwide.

Fair enough.  I know that they hand Yubikeys out like candy at Google.


It's a shortsighted strategy, but then again, companies are often guilty of shortsightedness.  
Whether a user gets hacked due to their phone company or due to your systems, they're still going to be unhappy.


Sad to hear.  I hope U2F doesn't suffer the same fate.  Would be nice if mobile phone manufacturers would build U2F hardware right into their phones.

No, but then again, a bitcoin was only worth 8 cents back then.
2 years after bitcoin was born came Silk Road.
Bitcoin's worth seems to have increased naturally with increased usage according to Metcalfe's law.  
I was in Japan when Bic Camera started taking bitcoin and used it to purchase retail electronics.  I've used bitcoin to pay for VPN, hosting, beer, gyros, fried rice, hotel reservations, airline tickets, and memberships.  I've bought bitcoin from an ATM and directly from other users via Localbitcoins.  I've donated to my favorite causes and authors using bitcoin and I've even done some online gambling.  As you probably know, these are just a fraction of the use cases.  Some people even get their salary paid in bitcoin.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but ETH's main use case is conversion to fiat and other cryptocurrencies.
Corporate backing certainly helps, though.
