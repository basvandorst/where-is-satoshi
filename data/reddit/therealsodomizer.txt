ASIC are very new, they started taking over in the summer.
I never ordered my bitfurry rig... but I wish I did,  It would have done well.  I know lots of miners got scammed early on, and its still risky today.  It's still is very new, look at  great for picking hardware.  ASIC is a bigger risk than scrypt most of the best hash/$ ratios are had on the 5000 USD + machines.

Lots of people mine at a loss.  It's the only way people have made big money mining.  There has been a very small % of the time where mining is profitable at the current time of mining.  All mining investments need the coin to moon you are much better off to buy and hodl but I wouldn't do either in this space as its still dying.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:38:09
Explain how hes wrong about blockchain tech not requiring bitcoin.  We've already had hard forks and with mining becoming unprofitable until less hash power is available there is a huge opportunity for another fork.

5 Yup
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:24:00

The only reason the whole thing is linked up is the exchanges allowing crypto to crypto trading real time with no fees.  That would change in a regulated market if bitcoin ever really got traction.

Concern   Bitcoin is not immutable, and requires constant exponentially increasing computer power to keep it safe.
Concern   Goverments don't recognize bitcoin as a currency and may close down exchanges without notice.
Concern   Many exchanges in the past have been hacked or even worse have scanned their clients.
Concern   Early adopters have already dumped the coin for fiat.  Why should I jump in now?  To pay out late adopters that paid too much?
Concern   The community is always speculating on higher prices.

The fact that bitcoin is property and not a currency makes losses that much more difficult to write off, on the other hand. For the IRS, net capital (or property) losses are capped at $3,000 per year for married and single filers on personal tax returns.

I don't think you understand what they are doing.  They are curtailing the use of fossil fuels in certain provinces and having their own internal government report back to them.  This has not been audited and cannot be audited its Chinese.  It's the most ridiculous argument that somehow you draw the conclusion that bitcoin is green.  This electricity is obviously not going to the people who need it and instead is being diverted into a speculative asset.

It's a waste when you compare it to the current alternatives which use much less energy per transactions.

@_date: 2018-12-04 01:08:19
This is all good and dandy but why then, if there is truly an oversupply like you claim, why sir does China still generate 72% of its power by coal?  How will this be offset in any significant way if the elephant in the room won't be addressed.  Bitcoin is incredibly inefficient power wise per transaction.  Instead of focusing on displaying the virtues of bitcoin with crazy claims we could look at other realistic solutions like using the heat from all datacenters, not just bitcoin and put it to good use.  Anyways, enjoy living in the green bubble friend.

You're thin evidence that some province in China produce up to 30% of their electricity from solar is pretty far fetched to say that 77.6% of all bitcoin's mining energy is renewable.  You are sourcing information from the most corrupt reporting agencies, the Chinese central government.  It's just a joke to think that bitcoin is not being mined with fossil fuels and harming the environment like every other civilized activity humans do.  It's a general lack of engineering or science that enables your misinformed spreading of these bullshit claims.

Actually computer science has everything to do with bitcoin.  The engineering of the ASIC's that compute SH256 will eventually be replaced with advanced hardware we can't imagine right now.  Potentially in 10 years your cellphone could have the power to hash at bitcoins current rate.  If this tech gets developed while bitcoin is down in the dumps not getting any love because speculators drove out development like they are now then computer science and future hashing hardware could easily make bitcoin obsolete / hacked.
No one here is able to intelligently argue the physics and fundamentals of future hardware without a masters degree in the subject so not interested in your opinions on it.
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:08:36
o, what happens if the price drastically drops right after a difficulty re-target? If a large quantity of miners must shut down operations and the network computing power decreases with the difficulty still at higher levels, could this slow down block time drastically? If so, this would have serious implications on the ability to transact using bitcoin — any money received must first be confirmed before it is spent again. Users would be stuck waiting for a block to confirm that may take much, much longer than 10 minutes. What if it’s days? 
Lul wut.

I hope it's the end of a bubble and gives investors an entry point that actually stabilizes this commodity.  It's just such an ignorant way to make a currency that cannot be controlled by a central bank.  I know you hippies hate the central bank but you actually need one to prevent hoarding.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:06:34
2. Bit coin is not a currency, it's a commodity.  Currency require inflation to prevent hoarding, bitcoins don't inflate the deflate as they get adopted.  Mining does not fix this problem because it's not a variable rate.  The rate needs to increase per person wanting to use the currency not at a steady defined rate.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:22:59
Here is the problem.  Bitcoin mining has been built into purpose build chips called ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).  Your block erupter has one or many of these chips inside.  The chips are trying to sqeeze the most hashes per watt it can, so every time a new, more efficient chip comes out it makes the old chips obsolete.  Chips are obsolete when the difficulty increases making the electricity required to mine more expensive than the coins mined.
The new chips are faster and more efficient, and increase the total hashing power of the network.  Your rewards from mining are based off what fraction of the network you provide.  If your hashing power does not increase equally with the networks your returns will diminish.  
I'm pretty dumb so this will probably enrage some smart people but I hope its a good answer for a dumb person.
