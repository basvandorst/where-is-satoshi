do bank transfer on kraken you can buy in one. it is also better to buy in one incase gov ask you for source of income it will be easier to prove. You will be able to withdraw from kraken easily too, $25k/day for kyc verified account

$25k if you have tier 3, but if you get tier 4 verified then you could. You could just do 2 transactions its safer this way anyway :). I would do first day test $4k deposit because kraken is very strict is something is wrong such as reference etc. After that id do 2x $25k
