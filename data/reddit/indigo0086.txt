I am wondering if/when coinbase releases the bitcoin cash, will it show up on coinbase or will I have to do something to obtain them?  I'm cashing out into various backed up wallets and other than waiting in their approval hell I've got my litecoin and etherium out.

Why does bitcoin have some claim on a successful crypto.  Aren't people doing what the hell they want with their crypto.  Complains of bitcoin are amassing and when an alternative pops up as something people want or even speculate they want (like they did with bitcoin) it's an attack.

The government will anyway. You really think the dollar has any value without force backing it. Crypto should be able to improve and circumvent regulation not cowtow to it.

I was waiting for 5 days for my "48 hour wait period" to transfer my bitcoin from the vault to the wallet.  I had to cancel and try again.  No contact from coinbase, hit them up in their support twitter and no response.  They own your money and just let you have it when they feel it's your time.

That's one thing I find odd about the bashing of bch, claiming btc has sole custode on the source code of an open source project.  I feel that some janitors are attempting to cook in the kitchen.

Of course, I mean black market money gained through means that harm no one, but is "illicit" due to state regulation is good in my book.  Money itself is illicit and can undermines the value people place on it.

The problem was that it was valued comparatively to the illegitimate fiat they're unfortunately forced to use on a daily basis.  It's value was not based on price signals set by participants in a bitcoin economy, but by people hoarding and speculating and such rather than actually using it and sending price signals so that it could stand on its own. How is anything sitting around not being spent worth anything, the problem was the HODL mentality and poor technology to encourage an actual economy based on actual good and service exchange.

Except some are in it for the version of money that is controlled by a central private organization that lowers and raises it's value at a whim, while others are in it for cryptocurrency.

Don't think it's a good thing to be giving Bitcoin to the government. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:52:45
All the hold memes and hopes to cash out have allowed bitcoin to stagnate and not go forward with the original purpose to be electronic CASH (which can be used and not just hoarded under the mattress).  Maybe if it marketed itself like BCH it would be on the tongues of everyone for being useful instead of its dropping value

Crypto was meant to empower individuals by giving them control over their money, but the fiat system is too strong as far as how people place value on it, and the fact that they can hold and use it.  The prospect of making some of that disappear and come back in greater amount is also a strong instinct and led average joes talking about bitcoin like they were trading stocks.  This mentality is a boon for governments and agents who don't want individuals switching to a cryptocurrency system because once people realize that the fiat they yearn for is more practical, they lose interest.  Fortunately Bitcoin was on it's way to the grave as it didn't bother trying to cater to people who actually believe crypto is a gateway to being a better currency but a means of making it's populatirty and fiscal value higher.  The king is dead, long live the king.

I think I mentioned the artificially inflated prices and the fact that borrowing a loan for such amounts is the most damaging thing you can do to yourself if you plan on attempting higher education. The fact is that scholarships are obtainable but have standards that are based on the school system that is flawed and geared towards those that know how to test well. Colleges are extensions of schools, where teachers with little experience in solving real world problems outside of academia. At the end of the day more than years in college, a person will learn more from mentorships with people that solve real problems which for the most part they don't encounter from teachers because few schools have industry insiders teaching
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:26:54
So school now has a monopoly on art and humanities? If anything, state controlled education has no business in either. Either way you undid your own argument. Mentoring provides you with both priceless information that can only be obtained from those that have done it for many years and can easily die with them, whereas general information is easily obtained at your own leisure

This is terrible, the government has a vested interest in preventing btc from being widely accepted.  The point of bitcoin is to be one free of government control.  Granted the law says it must be converted to legal tender, thus freeing the bitcoin from government control, but it could very well one day be that the government decides to hoard bitcoin causing a disaster to the btc economy.  Garnted that is far off and hopefully there will be enough cyrpto accepted that the government couldn't control it without being blatantly authoritarian and invasive. 
But don't be neive, look into

Considering how many on this board were spouting on and on about the "bitcoin brand" you'd think that it would have stayed true to the creator's basic proposal of having it be electronic cash on it's own right.  The fact that other forks were able to make that statement reality without the use of addons says something.

Huh, most central banks that controll fiat are super rich and bank on being able to control how interest rates fluctuate.  They'll never come out on the bottom.  It isn't anarchy at all, but high-level controlled cronyism.  Just because the people don't have a say in the value of their money doesn't mean it's anarchy.
