If an EMP were to wipe everything out would the price for gold surge?

If one was really for adoption and utility one would sell their bitcoins for litecoin. Litecoin is a lot easier to process transactions and is much cheaper to process a transaction.

Technically he's got the highest of the low end Porsches... you know cause it is the GT4. You obviously don't know much about cars besides being able to tell what class porsche it is rather than its series

I can't help but feel so happy for this guy! Good for you dude!

 I think anybody who is selling needs to think of the possibilities if they do not sell. If you bought your bitcoin two years ago you have already made insane amounts. What’s another two years and the price would quite possibly be 20,000. Just my humble thoughts.

your take on bitcoin is why some people look at actual investors of bitcoin like idiots

I bought BCH at 360 a few days before. When I saw it at 2300 I sold it right then. I knew there was some sketchy stuff going down and it would not stay there long. Luckily i cashed my chips when i did. Sold right back for BTC.

Sell it for bitcoin in May or later. Turn less heads from IRS if any at all

I’d say it’s healthier than investing your time in some hoe where with her there’s no possibility of increasing her own value

You sir are locked in

Idk, I imagine myself selling and then seeing bitcoin go back up and being upset. I won't sell when my emotions are telling me to.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:45:07
Any thoughts on if there may be a drop before it makes any dramatic increases in the near future?
