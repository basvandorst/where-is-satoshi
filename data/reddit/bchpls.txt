[Here's a good explanation why]( - long but worth the watch though
Big blocks are just not safe

Bitcoin isn't mean to be money..
I just paid $127 USD in fees to consolidate my wallet but thats no issue with me, i'm still hodling

TIL: miners are "hired" and bitcoin can scale auto-magically.
You are kind of right re: miners, and in the scenario they "don't do it" - you are screwed.
I don't _need_ on-chain transactions, I _want them_ because I don't want to be forced towards LN hubs with KYC/AML.
Whatever you are talking about, _is not bitcoin_.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:17:43
Sure, if thats what you believe.
Does mining a 2MB block matter? Because 82% of the network is stating they're ready to.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:28:30
So say for example a miner creates a larger-than-acceptable block, say sometime in November (after block 494,784) and majority of miners accept it, and then continue to mine on that chain. What would happen then?

Mining pools are typically a group of users mining together for mutual benefit. Individual miners are free to move between pools but may use pools that represent their views.
Some mining pools also have their own miners.

Not all miners - we know BTC is [already congested]( today and can't afford to lose even 20% hash rate, let alone 50-90%.
The 2X fork is death sentence for at least one chain, maybe more.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:10:42
Then why do the majority of miners want nothing to do with it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:18:25
You are mistaken - there was no pre-fork signalling for the BCH split.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:30:35
You're not thinking this through...
(hint: bitcoin is the longest valid chain)

Slushpool is [~6.6% of the overall network this week]( and [their voting]( doesn't look representative of the network in general.
Overall support is at [82.64% over the last 24 hours](

Miners typically look at profit in two different ways:
- Short term in what they are mining today - this is often dumped to pay bills or reinvest, or for a long-term (savings).
- Long term is what they are holding and believe in - this is their preferred savings asset(s) or war chest.
Lightning threatens their business model so because they mine it today (for profit) doesn't mean they will next month. If 2x fails then look for many miners to start to dump BTC.

I am definitely speculating here. But you can be sure they are heavily invested and will vote with both coins and hashrate.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:54:17
And forks with no miners die.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:53:49
I know miners personally that are pretty upset they were sold Segwit+2MB and are only getting SW. Not sure who to blame for that but many feel it was a bad deal.
Miners are very quiet and holding their cards close, so November will be very interesting.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:53:29
Do you have any details on mining pools announcing support for separate 1x/2x chains?
From what I can see, they are still [signalling around 82%](
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:49:35
Signalling is how the protocol is changed and upgraded. If not by miners, then how is it done?
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:27:26
Miners are the only part that process transactions (create blocks) though.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:10:40


Probably anyone with their money secured in the chain.


It's not about rules, its about **scaling**. Bitcoin needs to grow exponentially in order to keep working.
