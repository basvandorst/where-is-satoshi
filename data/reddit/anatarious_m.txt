What happens if I lose my Trezor? then what?

I have little to prove to the reddit community, I am furthest from a redditor, nor am I going to be over or beyond what I have posted here. 
I merely made an account here thinking I'd link with individuals that have also been effected by this issue.
Sadly I've been barraged with nothing but low brow critique. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:19:39
They haven't owned up to anything yet, I have not received a status update, reply or any other information, its been 2 days already since this has happened.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:32:58
It is not sorted, you misread it.
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:19:54
If you told me that blockchain.info was going to get compromised and I would lose them I ofcourse would never have.
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:16:49
I have made contact with the guy whose other 6btc were stolen with the other address,
He has also heard nothing from blockchain.info

joehoe has been an absolute huge help. I had 100 coins stolen, unfortunately after speaking to him he didn't catch my address.

If you have been a long term bitcoiner, finding a company that honors its obligations is a breath of fresh air, excuse me if I thought this would be the appropriate place to do so.

Welcome to the 0.0002% club im out 100BTC
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:07:32
I fail to see the benefits. 
I can truecrypt 20 flash drives, hard drives, cds, along with my wallet.dat and leave them scattered everywhere, vs having one single trezor dongle, I can even have it uploaded and encrypted on a server somewhere in the world. This, I think, is one of the key ingredients to Bitcoins potency, it makes the world a very small place.
As for a compromised machine, I think that is a matter of due diligence, just like losing a trezor dongle.
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:20:54
I already have the email about the compromises, I also have opened a support ticket, but I have not heard anything for over 14hrs. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:35:18
I got an email back from your guys with a generic,
Dec 08 15:05
Hey there, and sorry to hear about this. You may have some type of malware on your computer that resulted in your funds being stolen, because your private information was somehow obtained. One of the most common types of these are browser extensions posing as bitcoin price tickers that are actually stealing your account information. There's also the possibility that you visited a phishing site posing as blockchain.info. Scammers send out phishing emails all the time posing as big named companies with the intention of stealing your login credentials. Using TOR to connect to your wallet could also result in a malicious exit node tricking your connection into appearing encrypted, but they are secretly stealing the information without you knowing.
By design, Blockchain.info never has access to users' accounts or bitcoins (more details here:  If you keep your password and private key backups secure, then your bitcoins are safe with blockchain.info. Since this information has been compromised, be sure to never use this wallet or addresses contained within it. I'd also highly advise against using the same password again. Sorry again that you had funds stolen from you. That certainly must be an extremely frustrating experience. 
Can someone who actually know what the hell is going on contact me? I have 2 open support tickets now.
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:59:45
I have received NO WORD from blockchain, even though all I hear is talk about there reimbursment.
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:27:06
already ahead of you, he saiid its possible to crack the address once the coins are sent elsewhere? or something along those lines. suffice it to say he doesn't have my coins.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:33:59
The stories aren't bs, I'm sure you'd be singing a different tune if your $40k went missing from the most reliable bitcoin buisness on this planet. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:47:13
Because in theory blockchain doesn't have access to the private keys, so the coins are not held with a 3rd party.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:38:56
joehoe only has a few btc at best to reimburse, apparently it was just a free for all when it was happening. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 23:19:30
I understand, does blockchain.info have an actual telephone number to reach them at? like its 100btc. I've been a longterm customer since conception.
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:31:50
Bitcoin Jesus!
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:22:59
Thank you Mandrik, I would appreciate if you kept the transaction details private.
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:27:20
I have heard the chant about the Trezor and printing out my keys on a piece of paper. All of these are absurd suggestions, they make bitcoins fungibility null. Quite frankly, whats the difference between a Trezor and me just copying my wallet.dat from by bitcoin-qt client onto a microsd card, or for that matter any form of flash media? Very possible to encrypt storage devices just as securely.
Also, I wasn't storing these coins. I was transferring them, as which I have always done this way, because of the sheer convenience, security, and now accountability, that bc.i has offered.
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:12:46
So where is my email blockchain? I've opened 2 support tickets in getting my 100btc back, and I've been ignored for over a day now. 
Answer my Ticket request you all know exactly who I am.
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:10:26
I know, at this point I'm even thinking of flying out to one of the blockchain offices to have it sorted out in person if they have any questions in regards to the legitimacy of my claim.
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:42:29
I am still waiting for blockchain.info to refund me the 100btc I lost last sunday that Johoe captured in last weeks hack and now this????
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:34:23
as I've stated earlier, I have little incentive to post my private information in regards to proving anything of this nature. You will have to take my commentary at face value.
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:07:28
sorry guys, I am in a panic over here. I'm even thinking of flying into the blockchain offices and talking to these guys in person.

This is a good point if you're operating out of a single wallet. I might just grab a trezor for the sheer novelty of it. Might come in handy.
