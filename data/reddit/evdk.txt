Hey, thanks. I got private Keys of my first 3 purchases. Will they always be relevant of doe they change when I send my btc to another wallet?
In addition, I changed my bch to btc. Does that generate a private key for the btc too?

Just like the supposed drop on August 1st?

Calling people an idiot really does not help your cause in promoting bch.

What does an atomic swap mean? Transfers without fees or instant?

Like others said. I did after a day or so with the coinomi wallet. You can also exchange it for btc there. Not the best wallet though. Could not change btc to bch yesterday. Ended getting my btc back while paying a fee.

Solid advice right here

Hey people,
I have been trying to look this up on the internet but in the mass of information I can't seem to find a clear answer.
The last few days I switched my BTC around between a few online wallets due to the fork. I generated my BCH and traded them for BTC. Now I own 3 app wallets with different currencies/balance on them. I would like to transfer all my BTC to one wallet and stick with it. When I transfer everything to one wallet. Do I generate new private keys for those amounts? And if not, what can I do to get ahold of my current private keys? Thnx in advance!
Kind regards

Jeez, I understand you hate the guy but wishing cancer on someone is next level. Chill.

Yeah wtf. Deal breaker for me.

Didn't bch gain over a 100% last month?

I don't see your logic. Advertising is needed to show the benefits of products. It's up to the buyer to decide if it's worth the money....

Shop? All I see is a container.

This so much. First I thought buying Bitcoin was a hassle. Little did I know it's way easier as Dutch person to buy BTC then in other countries.

Was it a segwit transaction? Because that seems like the 2nd output.

This. I'm just trying to get info on Investments I should or should not make and all I see is propaganda from both sides ridiculing the other.

Although I think you are right I suspect at least a decent portion of Bitcoin owners decide to sell just before 1 August which will make the price drop. I'm holding off buying right now and will wait on a price drop this week. If this doesn't not happen I might buy later in August.
