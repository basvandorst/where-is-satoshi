It really annoys me when I hear people call Bitcoin an “investment”. Although the word investment is subjective, I.e Bitcoin developers invest their time into expanding Bitcoin; the word reminds me of investing in stock and puts the primarily focus on the price. Bitcoin is so much more than that and the community has a lot to show for it. To me Bitcoin is a digital store of value, even better than gold, it is quite literally “digital gold”. Imagine a world which uses ONE currency free  from corruption, free from exploitation and free from crazy inflation. I’m relatively new to the Bitcoin space but I’m honestly fascinated by Bitcoin. Satoshi didn’t plan this overnight, he thought about every single possibility, preventing double spending, preventing chargeback even prevention against quantum computing attacks. Correct me if I’m wrong but apparently Bitcoin contains code that has other uses cases far beyond a digital currency. Being able to send money from A to B the same way an email is sent is gaming changing, it excites me. We’ve come this far in the last 10 years, many people have joined the Bitcoin community and many people have left, little do they know that this is only the beginning of a financial revolution.........

This isn’t what I’m looking for. I want to deposit a small amount of BTC into a wallet each month. I’m looking for something similar to how Coinbase allows automatic monthly transactions, however I don’t want to provide ID.
