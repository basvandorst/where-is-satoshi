Just curious. How did they send it from address info
@_date: 2011-06-13 13:41:37
Not really since hey could send the bitcoins to other address before they send it to you.
@_date: 2011-06-17 23:10:07
yea the mtgox fees are too high. I want a exchange where there are no trade fees and only fees to withdraw.
@_date: 2011-06-20 12:35:49
Listen guys it doesn't matter if a script is looping or not. What matters is this: what has been withdrawn. When you send btc or cash to mtgox it goes into an account. From there mtgox can move the btc or cash to other accounts for security since not everyone is going to pull their btc or cash out very quickly or in large amounts. Even if there is all this buy/sell looping activity going on it doesn't matter at all. The btc/usd is just changing from one account to another but not leaving mtgox.
Mtgox watches the withdraws like a hawk, I think they are processed by a human. The reason they do this is because mtgox knows that if someone breaches the system they are going to want to pull as many btc and usd out as fast as possible. If mtgox notices tons of withdraws being requested then its a red flag. Luckily we didn't get to that point.
Instead the hacker created a loop script to do a massive sell/buy orders and collapse the market. This obviously raised a huge red flag and mtgox was able to stop everything before the hackers started to withdraw the money.
If the hackers really wanted to fuck with us then what they would do is hack accounts over the course of 3-6 months. That way their activity would go unnoticed with the occasional, "omg my account got hacked?" forum post.

aww, my child, you must first understand money before you can understand bitcoin!
@_date: 2011-07-02 09:59:49
Yup, well the fact of the matter is that you have to prepare BEFORE hyperinflation. If hyperinflation is actively occurring then chances are you have already lost a significant value of your fiat holdings. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 09:30:44
NO, LET THE FREE MARKET HANDLE IT.
@_date: 2011-07-02 09:06:37
I said we need open source btc EXCHANGE.
@_date: 2011-06-20 12:22:17
wow crazy, never knew you could do that. Thanks for fast response.
@_date: 2011-06-13 10:00:32
the source of the wealth is the fact that people are willing to accept it and trade it, as proven by the fact that people are buying/selling it on mtgox.
There doesn't have to be, "inherent wealth."
The only thing a currency needs is for people to trust it and accept it THATS IT. There are many reasons why people trust and accept a currency (good store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account etc). 
Those 3 attributes make bitcoin FAR SUPERIOR than USD/ERUO. Why? Because USD/euro grows expotentially, while bitcoin grows geometrically. (please look up those concepts to understand fully)!!!
"Bitcoins are a zero sum system"
So are traditional fiat systems. When was the last time you saw someone burning bank notes, or eating them? Fiat currency is PRINTED up out of thin air, in-fact most new money issued is simply in the form of digits on a computer. 
@_date: 2011-06-13 09:49:57
The US government can't even balance its own budget, what makes you think they know how bitcoin works, let alone how to draft a law to stop it?
@_date: 2011-06-15 08:58:20
It wouldn't be for mining, it would be for generating, a fraudulent block. You have to read the white paper to understand what I am talking about.
@_date: 2011-06-18 23:54:01
lol just wanted to hear some good stories but I can see your point.
@_date: 2011-06-18 10:54:47
Let me tell you this: I KNOW people have gotten rich off bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-06-16 09:34:23
Iceland isn't the only place. Electricity is cheaper than iceland in finland, argentina, canada, and ukraine. It also depends on where you are located in the specific country. You have to be located to a cheap source of electricity (ie. cheap coal, large hydro etc.)
@_date: 2011-07-07 12:00:49
If you don't have cheap electricity + cold climate, better sell your equipment now.
@_date: 2011-06-13 13:35:29
Your exactly right.
People think that money IS wealth.
So they think, "Hey, these bitcoins are being generated out of thin air, how can they be worth anything?"
Meanwhile failing to realize that Fiat USD is backed by nothing and is put into circulation by simply typing some digits into a computer at the fed. (literally). They also fail to look at history to see that fiat currency collapses into hyperinflation all the time due to central banks printing too much of it. So just as bitcoin could collapse to nothing, so could every fiat currency. No faith in the currency = no value. Period.
@_date: 2011-06-13 12:07:40
True but I believe this knowledge need not be known as long as the three principals of money are established: Store of value, unit of account and medium of exchange. From these three attributes being established trust/faith will be given to the money. For the, "average joe" as long as others have faith in the money then they will use it. Trust/faith in the dollar is the reason the average joe accepts it, even though the fed is printing it like crazy. Meanwhile, everyone who knows about money and how it works knows that government fiat currencies are bad things to hold due to inflation.
However, people don't understand those three principals so they can't figure out what money is and what is not money.

You don't need banks. The only reason you need banks is to interact with the fiat market. If we do all our commerce in bitcoins then there is no need for a bank.
@_date: 2011-06-18 10:11:38
Well I guess we are getting somewhere.
Theres lots of people who started early got lots of btc and who knows what happened after that. There has to be people who got rich since the price went from virtually nothing to over 15$/each.
@_date: 2011-06-14 07:36:52
Yea its outrageous but if you consider at the rates things are going, mtgox will not control the bitcoin exchange in the future. The owner is going to clear 3-4 MILLION usd in profit by the end of the year.
@_date: 2011-06-19 00:31:51
Simple solution to that: Don't keep large amounts of USD/btc in the account. Just like you shouldn't keep lots of money in the bank.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:37:35
It most likely won't increase in difficulty every 2 weeks or so because people will probably start pulling out of mining. Only those with the cheapest energy and most efficient systems will win.
@_date: 2011-06-13 12:12:52
True, I think the big break will come when bitcoin is very user friendly. I am thinking something along the lines of being able to go to an online bitcoin bank, opening up an account, getting a bitcoin debit card and having access to some sort of bitcoin android/ios app that facilitates easy money transfer.
i'd hate to say it but It seems that illegal activities (drugs, prostitution etc) will be the main driver for growth of the bitcoin economy, just like how porn helped grow the early internet to mainstream use.
I could see people hiring a prostitute or buying drugs and using btc as a form of payment. Same story for drug cartels, terrorist organisations, hacker groups etc.
@_date: 2011-06-18 09:18:16
I'll say 100k+ increase in value BUT I am not going to be picky, just want to hear some good stories about bitcoin!
@_date: 2011-06-12 09:46:19
OMG WE'RE ALL GONNA BE RICH!!!!!!!
I know it for sure, I am getting a mansion!
@_date: 2011-06-15 08:59:51
When I say, "all joining up together."
I am talking about the CIA leasing the supercomputers for maybe a week or two to produce the fraudulent block. Most of the current supercomputers are used by universities (research) and other businesses that need the cpu power.

yes but btc can be converted to virtually any currency with that being said, it is VERY useful for hyperinflation situation. Especially if you quickly need to dump your fiat.
@_date: 2011-06-20 12:26:06
got one in spam. Just report it as spam so others don't get tapped.
@_date: 2011-06-20 12:40:25
it was mtgox end of story.
@_date: 2011-06-15 11:40:44
my guess is there is some sort of fee that has been applied to the account? A negative bitcoin doesn't actually exist.
@_date: 2011-06-13 10:24:29
thats because you spend your money on bitches and hoes ;)
Mo money -) mo spending on bitches n' hoes -) mo problems
@_date: 2011-06-18 09:06:57
Could be a game changer for bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-13 22:11:55
Yes. Thats why its basically a mad dash right now to establish the first, bitcoin user friendly services. Mtgox is already making a killing. I've heard they are making 400-600 btc/day. Thats 7.5k usd PER DAY.
