Oh dear, might as well sell up now and take a small profit. In Bitcoin you have to be able to hold through a 50-95% loss or be very lucky at trading. They go up and down with large changes. Long term I expect them to go up, short and medium term anything can happen.
Weak hands will always make a loss. Strong hands make a long term profit. Buy a little bit of a bitcoin every week then wait 5 to 10 years and you will have a great chance of a massive profit.

First rule of Bitcoin is secure your coins. 
2nd only invest what you can afford to lose. 
3rd HODL 
...at some point Bitcoin may be substantially cheaper than the price you paid, either look at this as a buying option or close your eyes forgot about it for 2 or 3 years and have a nice surprise when you see the price has doubled or increased 10 fold (or gone to 0). 
Most people who try and make money or Bitcoin trading actually lose money or Bitcoin. You are not  professional trader and there are plenty of those in Bitcoin. You are not a computer / software / app trader either and there are plenty of those trading Bitcoin.

A lot of people and minors fall for the simple easy to understand Bitcoin Unlimited. This is combined with discrediting core. Sadly it is very like Donald Trump.

Yes they did. Many many exchanges happened at that prices on local Bitcoin and in dark market exchanges based on the MTGOX price. It was very relevant. I have a friend who bought half a Bitcoin off someone at the top of the market, who is still not in profit lol.

Agreed, there is no way I would ever do that or understand what you are talking about etc. I am not going to be opening up channels on my router, as I don't know how to, and what if I open up the wrong one and allow myself or family to be easily hacked etc. 
In the early days I had a Bitcoin core wallet with 0.005btc on it, 2 weeks later I couldn't open it I realised that I didn't want to store Bitcoin on my computer as I am not clever enough to keep them, let alone keep them safe. So it is all paper wallets or online wallets for me.

When fees are over 10c I don't do any purchasing transactions in Bitcoin. I still have a bank account and credit card with cash back. I want to help grow the Bitcoin economy but not at any cost.

I think Ethereum still has a chance but... it will not massive price rises that do it, more lots and lots of coins in circulation in 5 or 10 years time with a moderate coin price.

It depends a lot on the moon. When Bitcoin to the moon first appeared during the run up to $30 the moon was always between $10,000 and $100,000. But the moons orbit can change. Only a few months ago there were people on here saying $1,000 was the moon and where shall we go next. They were wrong we are definitely not at the moon, if the moons orbit lowers Bitcoin fails.
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:40:36
Not that crazy at all. When I bought in during the first bubble up to $30 I expected to either loose everything or be a millionaire by now. Neither has happened but I still have 2/3rds of my original coins, have taken out my initial investment 4 years in a row, lost some to gox and another exchange.  Millionaire is still a possibility but unlikely this year or next year.

@_date: 2017-03-21 09:25:13
This is fairly logical.
He likes Bitcoin, he needs the fees to survive. He expects to loose a lot of fees after Segwit and thus mining won't be profitable. He doesn't want to see Bitcoin get over taken by an alt coin so he wants to find a way to implement Segwit or something similar whilst not diminishing mining fees. 
I think there are solutions. Personally I think than in the long term lightning network will drive adoption of Bitcoin thus drive the price higher and fees a lot higher. LN will be good but lots of transactions will still need or want the blockchain so miners with free electricity should do incredibly well... but safeguards could be put in place now. 
Such as for every 1 to 1000 Bitcoins traded on LN, LN must record this on the Blockchain doing a Bitcoin transaction. Or... maybe LN has a maximum transactions size of 0.01-10Btc, to force all larger transactions onto the blockchain.   Im sure others could come up with better ideas than me as to how to do this, but these ideas need to be discussed with the miners before implementation.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:17:58
Its like the nuclear deterrent. Sounds great on paper but in practice when everyone knows you won't implement it/nuke them, then it becomes more of a liability than a threat.

It looks very unlikely BU will ever get the 75% needed to hard fork but this doesn't stop them blocking everything that Core does, which will bugger up Bitcoins future whilst they pump alt coins.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:49:52
There is no real way out of the stalemate. Bitcoin is in limbo until BU gets 75% or until Core fork. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:05:00
Lol im not. Most cryptos are gaining on Bitcoin. If the stalemate continues for another 18 months then im pretty sure Bitcoin will not be a top 3 coin by market cap.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:34:18
They don't want to separate as they have an inferior proposition so would lose, they want to get 50+% mining power (pref 75% mining power) then hard fork to BTU. They will use all resources to kill off a BItcoin core chain by adding empty blocks. If the core chain survive then BU have lost as no rational human would take a centralized Bitcoin Unlimited over a decentralized Bitcoin Core chain. 
BU signalling is now around 40%, everyone should be deeply concerned. A BU only Bitcoin is worth a lot less than Eretheum in the long term.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:17:25
You make some valid arguments...
I call myself a long term HODLer but I only actually have 2/3rds of the coins I initially purchased. I lost coins to mtgox and another exchange that is long gone, but also for the past 4 years I have taken out my initial fiat (£11,000) investment every year. This paid for our wedding and we have been on holiday to Australia 4 years on the trod with the left over money (each holiday during our winter time for a minimum of 3 weeks).
I am still a HODLer. If Bitcoin fell to zero I would still be hodling. If Bitcoin goes to £5000-£10000. I would consider selling half and buying a larger home for my expanding family, and maybe a Tesla too. In the mean time I will keep selling my initial fiat investment each year and enjoying life and loving my Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-02-20 11:36:11
I trusted mtgox for a couple of years. Luckily I took out all but my trading coins a few months before they went under. Paper wallet in 2 different bank vaults in a different city for my cold storage. Play money spread over 3 exchanges. 
If there is a fire at one or one is raided I immediately go to the other bank, access coins and transfer to a different paperwallet. Not 100% secure but pretty close to. Anyone finding my paper wallet in a bank vault is unlikely to recognise it as a paper wallet (i shall not disclose details about this but use your imagination and you can make a paperwallet look like quite a lot of things) thus unlikely to spend it before I get to the other bank and re-secure my Bitcoins again. This setup is for personal security of myself and my family and at the moment is unnecessary but if the price rises 10 fold then it becomes necessary.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:43:36
First heard about Bitcoin really early on but life got in the way, I wasn't prepared to learn how to mine and there was no option for buying. Next I heard about it was at $2. I knew I had to cash out my life savings (which happened to be equal to my small UK student loan). By the time I had got my money and sent it to Mtgox in Japan and bought coins, I ended up paying around $20 for the coins, so I got 10 times less Bitcoins than I planned to buy initially! When they dropped back down to $2 a few months later I was thinking myself stupid for being in such a rush to buy. I had lost my job so had no means of buying any more. I still have 2/3rds of my initially purchased coins. But if I had waited and bought at $2 instead of $20 I would be a multimillionaire. I currently am not close to becoming a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:44:43
It is not Bitcoin. But... if they get 60-75% hash power then they attack. They will hard fork Bitcoin to BU protocols, and spend all there resources possible killing the Bitcoin core chain by adding empty block after empty block etc. 
If this happens there is only one Bitcoin and it is BU. BU are currently at 40% hashpower so a hostile takeover of Bitcoin is a very real threat.
If this happens Bitcoin is basically dead as the proposals you highlighted are stupid. If you want a centralized coin that is well supported go for Eth. If you want something similar to Bitcoin take your pic of many alts. I would be going for something like PIVX, purely because it is proof of stake and build off core code. If BU takes over miners have basically killed Bitcoin so I would​ definitely be heading to a coin without miners.
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:59:36
Interesting perspective. I am a Holdler but every year for the last 4 years I have spent the same amount as my original fiat investment in Bitcoin. Hodling increases the value if Bitcoin due to scarcity and the value needed to increase. With a market cap of $1bn very few retailers accept Bitcoin, with a market cap if $10-20bn a lot more retailers accept Bitcoin.
I hodl. I still have 2/3rds of the coins I bought, but I have approached lots of companies and charities to spread word and accept Bitcoin.  Friends have taken up Bitcoin purely because of my success and enthusiasm. I have even invested Bitcoins in Bitcoin businesses.
I believe Hodling is important still for Bitcoin and necessary until we become a $100bn currency. 
Hodlers see Bitcoin as a currency growing in value so they keep hold of there Bitcoin as an appreciating asset. Spending Bitcoins is also good for the currency but with the stupid high transactions I rarely do it for anything other than holidays and large purchases.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:30:36
If there is a hard fork and the current chain splits then BU have lost. They have very little support for BU, hence they need to kill off the other chain even if they loose $hundreds of millions, as 2 chains means BU coin eventually equals close to 0.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:44:51

BU will only hard fork with 75% of miners support. That is very unlikely this year and unlikely in the foreseeable future, so we are at a stalemate where BU blocks everything Core does that could improve Bitcoin. Miners like this as we have relatively high price and relatively high fees. This is really bad though as other alt coins will gain in popularity and usefulness. BU supporters are heavily into Alt so they like the stalemate.
The only people who loose are the normal Bitcoin users and supporters.

It doesn't matter how it happened for beating an all time high. People still bought and sold Bitcoins at a higher price than you made out. Just because Bitcoin was manipulated a little to its all time high on gox does not matter. Gold and silver were both at all time highs around that time too.
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:32:45
I imagine the answers to your main question is yes it is legal. I also imagine the answer to your 2nd is no it is illegal for friend then to give you the fiat equivalent in return, as even if this happened a year or 5 apart it would almost certainly be deemed to be a sale thus tax may be due. 
However I am not a resident of usa or Hong kong, more speculating on a tax norm.

If you think that mtgox caused the rally and crash of Bitcoin then they probably also did the same to gold and silver which rallied and crashed at the same time, or is the mtgox fruad part over blown and the biggest exchanges probably would have got to that price regardless?

My dad is not particularly wealthy but not particularly poor. If at the age of 17 I had asked him to lend me $10,000 he would have asked me a lot of questions about why but he would have backed my judgment and lent me the money. He would have lent it interest free and would only of expected financial repayment if he thought I was doing something really stupid. 
I know this because when I was 19 I wanted to be one of the first in the UK with a subway franchise. At the time you had to stump up around $30,000, and he said that he could sort the finances for me to do this. Ultimately I could see a future where I had 1 successful Subway but didn't have the finances to get any more and realised I didn't want to spend the next 10 years running a subway so I went to university.
So what I am saying is if you're dad is relaxed about it then do it. Follow the advice on here from others ie buy 1 per month for 10 months keep somewhere safe, HODL, dont be concerned with the price in the next 2 years at all. Hodling through a 90% dip is difficult but doable.
If you are looking at a 5+ year time frame I would say you are 90% likely be above the current price, and 50:50 to be 5+ times the current price. But make your own assessment. If the price is below the current price remember it could be way below close to 0. There is a risk in every investment, Bitcoin as an investment is more risky than most. But it has more potential than most too.

No idea why the police were there... but once you have police at your house you do not pick up a cross bow, you do not fire it at police.

There were 18 police officers so I wouldn't be surprised of the 3 in for questioning all fired the instance the arrow was released.
Maybe the police were there on a trumped up charge or maybe there were more than there needed to be. Do not threaten a police officers life. Sure the arrow may bounce off body armour but the body armour doesn't cover all of your body.

Blockchain.info wallet has a follow only option for paper wallets. You put your paper wallet address in the system. When you want to do your test run, scan your paper qr code or type in your private key it will send the test amount and keep the rest on your paper wallet. It works quite well. Obviously if you have a virus on your computer, or someone hack blockchain.info wallet at that very time etc then someone could intercept your private key, but if you are doing this as a test then sending the rest of your coins to a trezor straight after then I see very little risk.

His spoken English was pretty impressive but not as good as a native English speaker. His listening was second to none and he could understand everything. Programming, online chat and watching YouTube had taught him well.

2-3% of 500k is 10-15k. Thats not a lot to live on. Also inflation is a pain. It about 3% in the UK right now. So if we made a 3% return on the year we have actually made no gain in comparison to purchasing power.

Hmmm mixing US politics and Bitcoin is a bad combo. I would say Trump is bad for virtually all humanity but I tend to think in any other western nation the democratics would be a right wing party. 
So the positive is some guys who like Bitcoin are in his team. But hell I tend not to like those guys either. If Roger Ver was in Trumps team would that be good or bad?
The negatives are everything else.
Trump likes control, Bitcoin is not control. He does not like freedom of speech and berates anyone who says anything negative about himself. Not really sure how that sits with Bitcoin.
He dislikes China where most of the Bitcoins are mined.
Just imagine if he tries to build his wall with Mexico and Mexicans refuse to pay for it... they then send Bitcoin back across the border instead of fiat. How pissed will Trump be? He will probably want to go nuclear on Bitcoin until someone tells him it doesn't exist in a physical form!

Op this has been asked a few times in the Bitcoinuk sub. You may be unlucky and qualify for normal tax. You may however qualify for capital gains. Which is first £11000 free and then 10% until you hit higher rate tax bands then 20% for the rest.

I like your thinking, I think we need lightning and we need segwit. I personally think we need block size increase too but if Segwit and Lightning both implement (I would guess segwit is 50:50 at the moment) preferably soon then maybe we don't need a block size increase yet, but a blocksize increase should be tried and tested and put on the books ready to implement at an agreed time.

Lol you just needed to shop around. My credit card gives me cash back, has no fees and offers me consumer protection if I purchase with it. No crypto is ever going to beat that combo. Why would I make a purchase another way? Personally I saw Bitcoin as a digital gold, that happened to be currency that offered only disadvantages to me if I spent it (unless it was on something dodgy or something my government didn't approve of- sadly im not that kind of guy). I do believe there is a use case for a crypto to offer micro payments if they can get the long term costs down to below $0.0001per transaction whilst scaling to billions of transactions per day. Possibly. V3 or V4 of lightning networks may be able to do this but I wouldn't hold my breath.

There is no way to know if now is a good time to buy. Yes we are high priced historically but we are massively under valued, we should be around $2000. 
Best bet is to average cost, buy some bitcoins every month for 6 to 12 months until you have spent the fiat money you want to. If price goes up then you loose a little bit, if price goes down you gain a little bit. 
Im in the UK, I have done meet in person transactions, and bank transfer on local Bitcoins before, for over 100 Bitcoins. Not sure I would trust any other payments on local Bitcoins though.
Money goes missing in the post very frequently.
Once you have bought plan to hold for 5 or 10 years, don't worry if they go down 90% or up 300% in the next year, both are possible but does not mean anything for your investment.
I prefer paper wallets, made off line, duplicated and then put in safes that I have no easy access to (think 3hours on a train and waiting for bank to open) this atops me from panic selling, but Trezor et al are ok too.

What do you call high? My feeling is we should be at around $2000 at the moment, so we are massively cheap. All the agro in the forums and the high fees are putting doubts into peoples minds and stopping us reaching the fiat price we should be at.

Either paper wallet offline or something similar to trezor. Then secure paper or trezor.
The standard info is to spread investment over 10 to 20 months to give a good spread of cost of coins. If you buy now, maybe you are buying at the top of a bubble or maybe you are buying at the bottom of a massive run up. If it was up to me I would probably do half spending now then spread the other half over the next 10 months, to mitigate the risk of a price drop a little, but to minimize the risk of a price increase too.

Best advice to a new Bitcoiner aside from look after your Bitcoins, paper wallet or a Trezor etc is a must.
There are loads of Altcoins around I imagine 1 day an alt coin will be worth more than a Bitcoin but this may not happen and out of the 1000+ coins the winning coin would be difficult to pick and may not yet be created. I once sold 1 Bitcoin on local bitcoins for £700. The lad went on to purchase 6 Litecoins with this Bitcoin. These Litecoins would currently be worth a total of £15. The Bitcoin would currently be worth £575. This does not mean Bitcoin will be worth less in the future. Expect the price to fluctuate a lot over the years. 
Invest over time and you will have more chance of success. Had the lad I sold Bitcoin to for £700 purchased once a month for 2 years his average purchase price would be under £400 and he would be massively in profit presuming he didnt waste them all on alt coins.

It makes sense but only in a small amount of cases. Firstly the hardware needs to be used near constantly so if you have a powerplant that is used for 3 months of the year and is not selling the energy for 9 months then you have a good business. Buy and install top equipment mine constantly for 9 months, sell equipment second hand buy new top of the range equipment 3 months later and start mining again.
If your powerplant sells every day between 1pm and 7pm you are reducing your potential income by 25% on new hardware, this would almost certainly mean there is no justification in buying new hardware to mine and thus only using what you can get for free or very very cheap. In this case the installation and operating costs may still be above your income unless we see a large increase in the bitcoin price.

Exchanges go belly up, get hacked etc. I think if you had left your coins on most of the exchanges that were around 3 to 8 years ago then you would now have no Bitcoins. 
Here is a non comprehensive list of 36 Bitcoin exchanges that no longer exist (it was written 2 years ago, there will be more now)
So if you lend Bitcoins on an exchange then they have ownership of your coins.You are tied to there success. Polo and Bitfinex are probably the 2 largest sites that do this and I would suggest that the likelihood that one of these exchanges ceases is much higher than the reward you gain in interest. 
I do keep some trading coins on a couple of different exchanges but I only have Bitcoins on Polo because I haven't yet been verified to withdraw my own Bitcoins 3 months after applying. 
I would never keep my hodl coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:30:49
Not at all, I have no idea what the total number of Bitcoiners is but Bitstamp have 591,000 users. I think it is the 4th largest exchange, so I reckon even making up for people having accounts at multiple exchanges there are probably at least 2m Bitcoiners on the exchanges. There is probably quite a few more that dont use any of the exchanges. So I would suggest a fairly healthy number of people are Bitcoiners.
Investment wise there is a lot of money invested that wont be profitable until bitcoins are 5 or 10 times the current price. Personally I think we are massively undervalued and should be at $2000, but the power play by miners wanting to oust Core is and will continue to hold us back. I would give it 18 months and we will be there. No more really cheap coins.

Ive had Bitcoins a while, I was Bullish when I bought and I am still Bullish. When I bought I thought they would be at the moon by now. It is Christmas time, lets spread some cheer. I would be very surprised if Bitcoin doesn't get to $2000 in the next 18 months, Im sure we will have at least 1 big price drop before that. I think we should be at $2000 now and 18 months late is better late than never. We are currently rising at 6% a month, and at this rate we will get to $2000 in 17 months... but I expect some large drops, some slower months and some very speedy gains en-route because this is Bitcoin.

I think Bitcoin doesn't work as a payment for the masses unless it offers something better or different or cheaper than conventional.
I can purchase on credit card, get 0.25% cash back, pay off credit at the end of the month automatically  all for no fees fron my credit card and no fees from my free bank account. Most bank accounts and credit cards are free in the UK.
On top of that I get section 75 consumer credit protection. So if I don't receive the goods or service or they are not as expected or fit for purpose and the retailer does nothing about it (say the airline goes bust, or it is a scam etc ) the credit card company has to refund me the money back within 24 hours of asking. 
Now I love Bitcoin but unless companies are going to offer me a healthy discount for using Bitcoin it then it is not going to take off as a payment provider in the UK and probably not in most of the EU. It makes a good store of wealth and speculation on price rises etc. Also transactions can get stuck for an hour or 12 meaning you miss the deadline for next day delivery etc.

1) Privacy has its place, but it wouldn't worry me unduly if all my transactions were posted on the front page of Google every day, 
2) Bitcoin can go down aswell as up, I was 95% down in year 1 compared to fiat. I have since had others years when my Bitcoins have been down compared to the previous year.
3) Does spending Bitcoin rather than merely HODLing make Bitcoin stronger? Probably it does.
4) I believe in free health care for all (nhs), this would not be provided by any private market. I think totally free markets are virtually impossible to implement and the current implementations we have do not usually work in the best interest of everyone. Lets just let all the poachers kill all the worlds elephants for ivory as there is a market for it, if you want to enslave someone or a whole continent of people then do it. Nope that doesn't sit well with me. I think we need governments, rules, laws and police, free education, free health care. I like paying my tv license to get quality tv channels and radio stations with no adverts. Sure all governments could do better, most should be less corrupt, some could be smaller and more nimble but I think they are essential.
This doesn't stop me from being a Bitcoiner. It just makes me a normal person who is also a Bitcoiner. Most people who use Bitcoin are normal and if you are going for mass adoption then you need to appeal to the masses. They might love your ideals but most people seeing there Life savings plummet 95% would bail out, they wouldn't be thinking ooh its nice not to have deflation I will carry on holding Bitcoin as it is bound to be worth more in 2 years time. Most people would want better privacy if asked but probably don't understand what little privacy they currently have or actually ever do any transactions that would warrant them needing increased privacy. Most people aren't going to make Bitcoin stronger because if they spend a Bitcoin buying something psychology says that most people will not re buy that Bitcoin at a higher price than they originally paid before spending it so they end up with no Bitcoins and this ends up harming Bitcoin.
Sorry waffling rant over, I really love Bitcoin but currently people who want to spend Bitcoin are in a massive minority. As a store of wealth this doesn't matter as a currency bring on Lightning network and more.

My mate Kev was on the news talking about this. I reckon that he is now my claim to fame! I tried to get him to say all sorts of silly things on the news but failed. As far as Bitcoins go, they may be less vulnerable to this type of fraud than a bank but when someone steals Bitcoins from an exchange or online wallet you rarely get your money or Bitcoins back. Kev lost close to £600 has appeared on the national news and will probably get all his money back within a week and maybe some compo for poor service and not being able to shop online. I lost Bitcoins when Bitmarket.eu went bust and have not seen a Satachi since. Similarly I lost Bitcoins when mtgox went under and not had any of it back yet.  The latter was my trading account, and the loss represented about 6 months of full time trading profit. I like Bitcoins but I use the paper wallet in a safe in a bank as my security now. We have no banks with vaults in my town so I have to go to London to access my Bitcoins. I am now a Hodler.

I bought in at a price slightly higher than $17 with around £10,000. When the price dropped 95% 6 months later I was really wondering what the hell I had done. I really wish I had bought more at this time, but I only had £1000 left and needed it as a savings buffer for rent etc.
What I will say is that once the price got above the price I bought it for I have sold of £10000 (my initial investment) worth of Bitcoin every year, the first year I think I sold for around $40 a coin. I haven't become a millionaire and would need a massive increase in the price very quickly to give me a chance, but I still have a healthy balance of coins left and most of this years coins are now sold. If the price continues to rise I may be able to do this for the rest of my life which would make it a fantastic investment, otherwise I probably have another 10 to 15 years left at current prices or less if the price crashes. I will try to hold 1to 5Btc for retirement fun in 30 years time.
Oh and if bitmarket.eu hadn't gambled my coins away I would have another 50BTC, and another 30BTC lost at MTGox. Im glad I learnt to use paper wallet locked in a safe in a bank.

This is the home of wall st, the bankers were trying to break Bitcoin but seemed to forget it was worldwide and when the companies cottoned on to the fact that NY was just trying to stall them, they are setting up in friendlier climates instead.

Can you not just use bank transfer on local bitcions in the usa? I am in the UK and I have only ever met up once to use cash, all other transactions have been via free online bank transfer. If you are wanting to purchase 50+ coins you are going to need a fair amount of cash, and use multiple sellers. Most sellers and buyers around here limit themselves to 0.5 to 20 bitcoins in 1 transaction on local bitcoins. Local bircoins will have a receipt for you whatever method you do.

Yes, that is great and really interesting when I have read your posts about it, but it is very uncommon. I think probably under 10 people in the whole world have totally given up fiat for Bitcoin. The links you provided are really useful, and I would go as far as saying 99.99% of sites claiming that you can earn Bitcoins from them are scams so it is nice to show a new user how you can keep doing what you already do but use Bitcoin instead. 
To see a 5 or 6 times price increase we can get there with the adoption of 5 or 6 times more people or a few more whales or just one country deciding to create a Bitcoin reserve like a gold reserve. None of these mean fiat is destroyed.
I am in my 30s and do not expect the collapse of fiat in the western world in my lifetime. Some currencies may change or cease existing but I anticipate that they will be replaced with new or older fiat currencies. Governments like control.

Bitsquare has a few problems. I cannot set it up to only sell at market price when the price is above £1000. It costs me real money to list a sale at Bitsquare, If I chose at market, the price always drops below my threshold before I get a customer, meaning I have to cancel the listing and lose my fee. If I put in my minimum price, no one bites and then when the price on other exchanges is 10 or 20% higher someone wants to buy from me. But then I am loosing 10-20% on a sale, so I cancel as soon as the market moves more 2.5%, this costs me a fee again. All in all I have done 2 successful trades and cancelled about 20 listings. So I would personally recommend anyone selling to steer clear. 
I love the idea behind it, but not the implementation.

Hi. I would get yourself a hardware wallet or similar... but with current US border policies I would not be transporting this accross any US borders if it has Bitcoins on it.
Blockchain.info is not a recommended wallet but they actually have a decent long term record of protecting Bitcoins. I have had 1 Bitcoin on there since MTGOX crashed i have a few on other exchanges but 90+% are in a paper wallet in a bank vault. Blockchain has a history of poor responses to help but that may be because most people who need help have got a virus or have been scammed/hacked/lost login details, they can't help with any of that.
It depends on your risk profile. I am happy to leave 5-10 Bitcoins on 3 exchanges for ease of trading and cashing out. I understand that if the exchange goes down I will most likely loose my Bitcoins but last month I turned 4 Bitcoins into 30Bitcoins just by gambling on an alt coin and 5 Bitcoins into 6 by gambling on another alt, so it is worth it to me.
Just so you know both sides I lost around 10 Bitcoins when MTgox went under and a couple more than that when bitmarket.eu gambled its users Bitcoin. I haven't seen a Satochi back from bitmarket or mtgox.

Agreed. After taking away £ withdrawals, they now bring it back with £60 fees. That is crazy high. You will have to sell 2+ Bitcoins at once to make this cheaper than Local Bitcoins with its massive spread.
Also if the swift originates from outside the EU expect more fees added from your bank. (My last Kracken withdrawal came from outside the EU and cost me a further £20.)

Coinbase is not an exchange. Gdax is the exchange owned by coinbase and it didn't hit $5000. Coinbase just add a % or 2 to the price on gdax whether you sell or buy so it would be above the price. No odea about the other 2. I thought okcoin trading in Chinese currency but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:53:14
Exactly my point. If there are 10 million coinbase users some will have more than 2 Bitcoin some will have less... but if every coinbase user wants 2 Bitcoins and there are not even 20m in circulation then the price could go stratospheric pretty quickly. Forget the moon Bitcoin could be heading for Uranus.

Wow massive post. Bitcoin is a currency, payment method, an asset class and a tool for speculation. Different people use it for different purposes and some like myself use it for all 4 purposes. It is difficult to assess it like a traditional asset or currency as it is both.
Do I think that the Bitcoin price will continue to grow. Yes short term and long term I expect the price to grow... but I also believe that there is a very good chance that there will be lots more dips and periods of Bitcoin price decline.  But in 10 years time I expect the price to be more than 10 times the current price (over $46,000)
The only thing I think that could stop this is a complete melt down between core devs and miners. Bitcoin needs both. Or a new super dooper crypto that is so much better in every way that most other cryptos just drop nearly all value.

Lol if you hodl it doesn't matter. You just wait until the price if what you want it to be then buy a new house with 10% of your Bitcoins. Yeh it might take another 5 weeks or 5 years but there is no stress as you ain't selling any until you can buy a decent house with x%. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:26:00

Meh total rubbish. First no $ exchanges hit $5000. So we never hit $5000. We hit $4980. 
Gdax never went below $4234.
Kraken never went $4140.
Here in the UK the lowest £ price has been £3238 ($4200) and my exchange coinsbank is currently trading above £3500 it's ath was £3999. So its quite a drop but not massive. 
I get the feeling that some whales are manipulating the quite a few exchanges and causing panic but that the buying pressure is so large on the other exchanges that they are not following the price too well.  
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:54:41
Getting into debt to purchase crypto is a risky move...
Saying that I purchased mine with student loan I had saved. I could have not taken the full loan out but decided to roll the dice. 
Also saying that no one knew Bitcoin price would explode upwards os just wrong. We all knew it would do this, we just didn't know when it would happen. Im not sure when it will happen again but I expect there to be a massive increase in price again, taking us above $50,000. And I expect it to happen in the next 5 years... but it may happen with gradual growth or it may take 10 years or it may not happen at all. But I still anticipate it will happen and so do a lot of Bitcoiners. 
Ps im sure there will be plenty of crashes in the meantime but if you hodl or buy more during the crash then if Bitcoin does make it you do very well.

Yes fees are very high, looking at my orders last year before they stopped selling gift cards I was buying £40 gift cards with 50% discount for £25.76. So purse were making £5.76 on a £20 order. I used to love getting the 50% discounts all the time but the fees are too high. Also gift cards were the best purchase as they were not time limited so I could just leave an order up and wait for someone to purchase. Then spend them when I saw a good deal. Also massive issues with returns. I basically stopped using the service a couple of months after they banned buying gift cards as returns were getting to complicated and I was getting bad feedback because of faulty products. I think this has all changed but waiting weeks or even minutes for someone to purchase an item to save 10 ti 20% and then finding during that time the price of the item had more than doubled so I was end up losing money on every deal.

Its a great comment, and some of it holds true for me too. Our family is growing (expecting another child in 5 weeks) and we will need a larger house in 6 months to 2 years. With the recent price rises I could sell all my Bitcoins and buy a larger house... but then I wouldn't have any Bitcoins. I have made a compromise. When I can afford a larger house with half my Bitcoins I will sell half. So I still need a doubling of price. If this happens I will loose half my Bitcoins but we will have a larger house that we will actually need.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:04:03

It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

Yeh I was scammed on purse too, quite a while back, on a faulty purchase. It took them just over a year to sort it out for me with a full refund. Anyway I used to love the service but it is not as useful now. After getting done over on a refund I moved to only purchasing gift cards at maximum (50% off+ purse fee). This worked out great as I was getting a super discount and I could buy any product I wanted instantly. So when amazon drops the price of something I wanted to a crazy cheap price I could buy it with my gift card balance and know that I had saved about 40% buying the gift cards through purse. As a price drop might only last a few hours this was way better than letting someone on purse buy an item for you because the price usually shot up before someone bought it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:05:05
Agreed 99% of my balance was in Bitcoin. I would want my Bitcoin paid back as Bitcoin not converted to fiat. But if they did convert to fiat a price would be difficult. As MTGox was trading at totally different prices to other exchanges before it ceased trading. Sometimes  lot higher but on it last week a lot lot lower. I imagine it was actually bust and using customers deposits to stay afloat for a year or 2 prior, although who in the company realised this I dont know.

The key to buying Bitcoin is when you see the price drop to lower than you pai, don't panic, maybe even buy a bit more to lower your cost of purchased. If Bitcoin succeeds in being a currency or a store of wealth then the price will continue to rise over tge long term.
Look after the Bitcoin you have purchased and remember the only way you can make a profit is if you sell your Bitcoin.

As a Trezor is the best part of $100, you cannot fob off this type of attacker with only $100 of Bitcoin. Admittedly this type of attack is very unlikely but if you are trying to mitigate it, it is probably best to have a significant sum(but smallish % of your Bitcoin holdings) exposed.

Bitcoin is competing with ETH and maybe Dash and Monero. No other coins have any transactions other than speculation trading.
No alts scale quickly or easily. Yes Litecoin might be ahead in the scaling, but Litecoin needs users not scaling solutions, and even if Bitcoin had 4 or 8 times the current number of transactions per second, blocks would fill very quickly. As transactions are expensive gambling sites no longer but transactions on the blockchain, nor do the Japanese. If these transactions started reappearing we could have $500 fees and 16mb block filled. We need proper offchain scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:22:47

I think someone has been spending too much time on btc with all the paid shills. Yes lightning is off chain but if the chain is full at 1mb and we specifically don't have gambling sites and the like clogging it up with small bets then the size of block Bitcoin needs would be massive. We are talking only 2 or 3 data centres in the world being able to download a blockchain in a couple of years time. That is too centralized. Best not to follow this idea.

There are some very dumb assumptions in this post. Bitmain only need 1 cpu to mine the hard fork as it will not be released for 3 days. During these 3 days they are going to use all the hash power they have and all the hash power they can buy to try and destroy the UASF and the legacy chain too. 
This is Bitmains and BU play to take over Bitcoin.   They will attack with more hash power than you can imagine. They will be spending upwards of $1bn on hash power during those 72 hours, the stated war chest is in the $hundreds of millions range, but this is the last throw of the dice.

The original vision is a non question, as Bitcoin had evolved from Satoshi's original vision before he left the scene. There is no knowing or caring which one he would choose to support. 
I support Segwit and I support the group of volunteer developers who have developed Bitcoin this far, they are known as Bitcoin core. Some of these developers are sponsored or work for other companies (a developer has to earn a living), I think MIT is currently the largest employer of core developers, with Blockstream 2nd. This is not a contentious issue for anyone other than people trying to stir up hate. 
Segwit gives roughly a doubling of transactions in each new block and has been tested and ready to go live for the last 6 months. The beauty of Segwit is it allows for a secondary layer of transactions to take place off chain so that people can buy coffees instantly whilst paying virtually no fees. There is also a bug in the current code that allows Bitmain (the largest supplier of Bitcoin mining equipment) to get an unfair advantage- asic boost, the current segwit implementation fixes this by accident. The flaw in many peoples eyes is that having transactions off the blockchain may be risky and not in the orginal plan. 
 Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitmain and a few Chinese miners controlled by Jihan Wu want bigger blocks. The​ idea is bigger block equals lower fees. The flaw in my eyes to this is that transactions are still not instant, and will eventually fill up thus meaning we get large fees again soon.  The larger the block the more computer power and bandwidth needed to run a miner or a node, thus Bitcoin becomes more centralized.  With 8mb blocks proposed yesterday by Bitmain only a few data centres in the world will be able to download the whole blockchain within a couple of years. So blocksize cannot keep increasing in size. For large miners this would create a massive barrier to entry for future competition, hence they want larger block, this would also keep asic boost which Bitmain has patented meaning that they have an unfair advantage over other miners.
Bip148 is Bitcoin users trying to force Segwit on the network, yesterday we got Bitmains response which is trying to force core developers out of Bitcoin and increase the blocksize. That is why the price has tanked. People are fearful of a Bitcoin without core developers and do not want Bitmain to have more power. 
Technically Bitmain announced a hardfork which shouldn't effect the legacy chain, take it or leave it... but BU have already announced that they have a war chest of hundreds of millions of $ and when the hard fork comes they will spend that money trying to kill the core chain. That is the bit that scares me, but maybe I am not technical enough to understand why this may fail.

My bank has always been cheaper. Here in the UK most bank accounts are free, bank transfers are free and instant, there are no fees for atm withdrawals, and most credit/debit cards are free. The only fees you pay are on on interest or overdrafts. Business bank accounts are not usually free but I am an individual. Consequently I have only ever used Bitcoin for payment when there is a discount to be had such as via Purse on Amazon. If we get lightning then I may be tempted as fees would be lower and transactions instant, otherwise hodl.
