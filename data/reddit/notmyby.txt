Unless the denominations are 0.1, 1, 10, or 100, they are NOT darksend transactions. There are use cases in which you WANT de-anonymized funds, and Dash preserves that ability. For example, one of the accounts holding funds for a group will want to see those payments on the blockchain. Also, if you don't care about anonymity for a particular transaction (say you are sending money to charity and don't care) you don't have to anonymize any funds.
Look for transactions with the 0.1, 1, 10, and 100s. Those are either mixing rounds in which all the inputs and outputs are those denominations (thus obfuscating the true source of each of the outputs), OR they are payments using denominated and anonymized funds to another party... try tracing the payments back to their source. It's impossible because each of those denominated inputs could have come from many addresses from the round before (at least three inputs could have been the source). Then each of THOSE inputs in turn came from another set of at least three identical inputs. Go through 3-4 rounds of mixing and you can see why the source quickly becomes uncertain. 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 = 1/81 at least. Jack that up to 16 rounds and it could be 43 million potential inputs as the source. Also CoinJoin Sudoku techniques don't work to deanonymize transactions because all the inputs and outputs are the same amount, like coins and bills, so knowledge of the amounts can't help deanonymize the blockchain.

I agree. She was not prepared to answer technical questions. But nor should she have been expected to. She is non-technical. Other questions should have been asked rather than railroading an easy target on technical questions.

OMG, there is so much misinformation in this interview...
- He asserts that the only means to achieve transactional security is by burning energy. While this is true for Bitcoin, it is not true for Dash because of the way transactions are secured by the masternodes. They need to educate themselves on how transactions lock on the Dash network.
- They assert that they could take control of the Dash network for $9,000 per day. If I gave you $9,000, just how would you "rent" half of the existing ASIC hash rate for $9,000? You can't. It's owned by hundreds of people. And the hardware is specialized, so you couldn't just rent general processing power. So you would need to buy millions of dollars worth of ASICs to do what they claim is so easy for $9,000.
- He doesn't understand the way the network makes decisions... the network funds the Dash team, who are the experts or "benevolent dictators" he references... the network does NOT make technical decisions.
- He doesn't understand how Sybil attacks even work, or how Dash prevents them.
- He assumes that there is NO amount of security that is too much to pay for... the petaFLOPs of the Bitcoin network is now higher than 200,000 of the world's largest supercomputer. At what point is it too much?
- He basically called Amanda a liar that ASICs don't exist for Dash. This is not true and easily verifiable. There are in fact four companies that have delivered them. He then asserted that these were just pre-orders. Not true, you can order one and have it delivered. Countless people have done so.
- He kept asserting that Dash doesn't have users. No crap... gaining users hasn't been the focus up to this point. It's been on developing a better Bitcoin. It won't be until Evolution release (next year) launches that gaining users will be the focus. Evolution will provide the user experience that will finally allow mass-market outreach would be efficient.
- He asserts that ELECTRICITY costs are what secure Bitcoin. First of all, that is not true. It is a combination of electricity, hardware, and people cost that make up mining. What is so magical about electricity costs? Nothing. You can equally secure a network with other costs. That's where masternode collateral comes in. You could not take over the Dash network if you want because the cost of buying 3,000,000 Dash to run the 3,000 nodes needed would drive the cost of Dash to infinity (as there are only about 2-2.5 million Dash not already in a masternode.
- If he'd done any research on the launch at all, he'd know that the founders would have gotten only a small fraction of the "instamine", that the cause of the instamine was a pre-existing error in the Litecoin code that caused the issue in the first place (not a malicious act), and that the early mining rewards were heavily traded on exchanges in the early days (thus most of the owners today bought their holdings and are widely distributed).
In short, this was one of the most misinformed, skewed interviews I have ever seen on Dash. One that attacks their guest on technical aspects of the coin when she never claimed to be a technical expert. The only person that should be "embarrassed" by this interview is the interviewer himself. He claims to be a technical expert yet doesn't even understand the technical benefits of a collateralized node architecture against Sybil attacks. This is just ridiculous.
