I dont have my bitgo address to check whether my funds are stolen. 
I have 2fa enabled for withdrawals as well. Is there a chance it can be stolen as well Thank you for responding to all of us here. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:33:47
I guess this is enabled in green address wallet as well. They should disable it as well.
Last week I got a new android phone. Google restored everything frm my old Android phone. I use PIN to login to my green address wallet. In the new phone I just logged in using the same pin and it worked. There is no setup of any sort in brand new device. It's kind of scary how Google gets all the private keys of the wallet and configured my phone
 green address didn't care even though PIN is only valid in a specific device.
Is there any green wallet developer here ?

Why there are many people complaining about coinbase every week in this sub saying coinbase doesn't deposit or withdraw their so for long or something ? It always take a post on Reddit to get your guys attention ?

I just feel if they can't pay us In full , all customers should get at least percentage equity of bitfinex based on their holding even though bitfinex might not worth that much . This will make us beleive in it again and also eventually make bitfinex better at security after all v own it .

@_date: 2016-08-10 14:50:46
Time to take out the money and go away frm bfx .
V lost 36% and we still don't know any details about how the hack happened . Good luck everyone who wants to trade in bitfinex in future.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:12:38
Yet another interim update with no real update. Awesome you guys. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 22:19:30
Would be nice if u guys sell it as well as a add on, with all the new  Android phones coming with type c .it would be helpful for many .

Very true.. when so many ideas regarding block size proposed, and I am quite worried there is not many concrete initiative steps taken by respectable bitcoin core, classic, unlimited group members in order to improve security when 1% bitcoin of all Bitcoin got hacked. I agree bitcoin is quite stable , bigger than ever, these hacks doesn't change the price that much unlike my gox. but They should do at least take initiative to do audit on all biggest exchanges , and some other bigger bitcoin companies and provide recommendations. This will create a better ecosystem.
Having said that debate of block size is gone too much and no party able to come up with resolution and make compromises is kind of depressing. Since they are not able to come to single solution they should do a mass voting and accept the solution which gets majority just like eth did recently. Even though etc is born becoz of that I believe only one will prevail in medium to long term .

My phone supports type c cable , will it work if I use micro USB to type c cable ? Not sure it exist though .
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:46:21
I was talking to Couple of my friends about bitcoin who don't have any cryto currency. They immediately recognized and said the currency that got hacked last week. Mainstream media definitely overblown the bitfinex hack and people have a impression it's bitcoin which got hacked not bitfinex. Even though it's a hack in a single exchnage it definitely give an impression that bitcoin is not that secure to many people who are not familiar with crypto currency.
Without changing this kind of sentiment I don't think bitcoin can attract many new people and the price won't change much in short term.

Awesome. Integration with mist. great .
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:24:10

+1 .. on seeing this on their front page I moved from poloneix to bitfinex last week. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:22:22
Hmmm .is there like an eta for it ?
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:26:02
Or bitfinex
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:06:03
Yes sir
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:22:44
Take note it's a light weight wallet... u can't use it for like larger transactions like ur mining payout address.  By using, it slows down jaxx wallet quite a bit.

I don't think many people are against segwit in other sub, they want bigger block as a first solution. Segwit improves malleability.

no worries exchange will replace customers coins with their own tokens .

For those considering moving to Iceland where pirate party mp told in iama last week, best bet for people in Iceland is to get out iceland.

Coupe of thousand a month. I am a immigrant so yeah. Need to send to couple of countries becoz of family over there. 
 It takes like1 hour now becoz of the confirmation delays in Bitcoin, used to be mins a while back. 
I use gdax here 0.15% commission, and 0.8% in the local exchange in the other country. It's less than 1% commission in total. 
Traditional remittance takes like 2% and 2 days.

Both r/Bitcoin and r/btc sucks for discussions. r/Bitcoinmarkets seems to have engaging discussions imo
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:37:32
Bitcoin is pure global currency for me. Which means u work in any country and u can get paid in Bitcoin. It's game changing for me. There are thousands of people earning a living in Bitcoin by doing online jobs in other countries  
For me, if u want to pay someone frm their work or something in a different country Bitcoin is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:09:22
People are not complaining they lost funds. They r worried becoz it's an attack vector. 
Fk sake u guys produce wallets in crypto space. V get it, there might be vulnerabilities discovered along the way. But as the wallet company atleast i would prefer someone who listens to feedback from the community and fix the loop hole instead of defending
