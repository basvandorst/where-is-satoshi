Its cool, Bitpay contributed to the directory. I love seeing partnerships to help get the bitcoin community some positive attention and to create a better more robust community.

I think that despite Apple, Mt. Gox, Russia and a mad bitcoin dump, it is stabilizing. People forecast that this is the bust of bitcoin but I agree with those foretelling stabilization. I think this shows how they can't keep bitcoin down!

In comparing bitcoin to the dot com boom we did indeed overvalue a lot of dot com businesses. However, as the article says, a bubble doesnt mean "no value" it means overvalued. It seems as Bitcoin has its big spikes and falls that the coin is finding its stabilization point.

Since Apple is being a jerk and kicking out apps like blockchain, lets support building bitcoin apps on android!

A new blog post about Brainwallets:   
It actually references this thread. I wouldn't trust myself to remember a complex enough key for it to se safe.

I think that as more business get involved with Bitcoin we will see a decrease in the volatility, as we recently did until the Mt. Gox and now the DDOS fiasco. However, I don't believe that Bitcoin will become stabile for a long time or truly ever. I think you will always have people who will influence the market with large sweeping buys and drive a bull market. But in many ways, that is part of the appeal. I am in bitcoin for the long run!

You can have him "invoice" you with Bitpay and he can easily split between USD and Bitcoin. He can adjust the percentages too. A book on Bitkids just came out:  
...your son is very progressive! I love it!

I am a bit fan of Bitpay. I use them with my business and have had really great interactions with their team.
