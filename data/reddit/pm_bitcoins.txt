A 2MB hardfork and segwit are two different things. A 2MB hardfork may get necessary backing by a vast majority. Doesn't look like Segwit its going to get it. Core should code it, and include malleability fix (without other controversial stuff, like 75% discount). 
That would allow LN to be, and end this stupid war.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:55:51
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:57:58
Maybe they don't like Segwit, there are more options than BU or Segwit
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:02:16
What about a 2MB hard fork including malleability fix (Segwit or other) that paves the road for LN?
Would everyone agree on something like that? Miners? Core supporters? BU supporters? Exchanges?
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:41:31
Hope you are right about the HF not happening
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:48:52
Good!!! Me too by the way, but for a pool that does not signal anything. I'll signal for a proposal that can generate consensus, and right now there is none. 
And that's how you vote on Bitcoin!! I's not perfect, but it's the best way we have.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:38:39
A 2MB hardfork that fixes malleability, or *any other proposal* that could be backed up by a huge majority could end this war. If not, hardfork, hate, and well kill the chicken that lays golden eggs. Neither segwit nor BU are that proposal, I think we can all agree on that.
If your job were to make a proposal that you honestly think everyone would agree on, even if its not the perfect one, what would you propose?
@_date: 2017-03-31 21:07:03
So things are awesome, talk about crazy changes like that one, to be implemented immediately (as HF of course) (but things in BTC are great, we cannot be in better shape) and a 2 meg HF that would solve all this mess needs years.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:24:54
Ok, but both networks will be extremely slow, right? Let me ask here this:
If the miner power splits, lets say, 50% 50%, both networks will be mining a block each 20 minutes for the next two weeks, until the difficulty adjust itself. Right?
So both will be extremely slow, and congested. Only in case of a clear mining support for one of them the network will be useful. Is it like this or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:40:52
One user one node? I'm a user and don't use any nodes (just Electrum, shared by many)
Node counting is a bad way to determine majority, you can easily and cheaply put thousands of nodes on a cloud service, get majority, then shut them down when the hard fork is finished...
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:50:50
So Bitcoin should be what the most competent developers think it should be, right?
By the way, who decides if they are the most competent or not? Is there a competence certification body? Did they managed to get full marks on Bitcoin University?
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:39:50
A chain with 20% hashrate can be easily attacked, thus is inherently insecure. There is four times more hashrate capacity outside this chain than inside. (80% vs 20%). Insecure!!!
Litecoin uses a different algorithm.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:43:50
Thank you, I didn't think of that. Horrible
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:22:36


Where did you read that? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:58:36
The number of nodes its even **worse** than hashrate in determining the economic majority. Witch, truth be told, I don't know how to measure. But certainly not via number of nodes. You can create hundreds of nodes in a cloud service at little cost. Copy$paste forever. It's waaaay cheaper to add 10% to the actual nodes than 10% of the actual hashrate
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:11:56
You want to centralized it on ONE planet? You know how many planets are there? Centralized!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:07:41


I stand corrected on Gavin.
What about the other two?
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:32:59
So that's it? A group of developers decide what is going to be? No votes, no nothing? Is this decentralized in any way?
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:45:22
There are more miners than developers, and the last ones have veto power already 
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:48:09
Good luck with zk-snark, I tried reading and didn't understand a thing. Witch is good. Look up Zclassic also, same thing with less BS
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:20:38
You have a  point, but 2 years ago there was no urgency. Now bitcoin is less usable, and we urgently need a compromise, an agreement. If there is none, then forks, brand image damage....
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:50:42
1) A change of PoW its an altcoin and wont be listed as Bitcoin anywhere in the world.
2) It will still require miners... d'oh
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:47:43
That's only partially true, I think users have stopped to use BTC for small transactions due to high fees, and some of them sell BTC due to risk of fork.
Myself, I changed to eth for some small payments that I have to do on a weekly basis, and last week payed a domain renewal with my credit card instead of the usual BTC :(
With low fees again I will gladly go back to BTC!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:02:58


Registered by who?
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:34:04
Ok thanks. About the HF, everyone and their mothers is preparing for it... I hope they can reach an agreement (Is it really that hard to put 2meg and segwit and everybody happy??)




My experience is different, they always ask for confirmations. But anyway, in case of HF, do you think they will still accept 0 confirmations? Too risky!!!
I fear that both networks will be unusable in case of fork for two weeks. Way to kill bitcoin, good job everyone!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:54:12
That's like an election run via twitter
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:43:26
Agree in every point. You also seem to be in agreement that the 20% hashrate chain will be much less secure than the 80% one, since it will be much cheaper to attack it. And since the hashpower is already there, mining the other chain, much faster also. To attack the big chain, new mining equipment  need to be purchased. That needs time. To attack the small, only seconds. So much cheaper and much faster... 20% chain is insecure!!!
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:14:16


Only Gavin so far. We don't need exaggerations that can escalate the conflict, sticking with the facts is always a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:34:49
Hashrate is the way to vote in Bitcoin... It's in the witepaper
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:24:25
Agree, that would be another good way.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:54:51
"Always an option" =! should
"Miners will deploy" =! should 
Is it me or it's now OK to manipulate truth as we want? No more objectiveness anywhere? Post-Truth? Trumps everywhere?
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:31:01
So let me understand, do you guys think that, let's say, a 2MB or 4MB block size would hurt decentralization? 
Even if it can run on a Raspberry Pi?
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:06:24


Situation right now is much worse than that
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:45:37
One year to make a 2MB hard fork? I've been earing that for the last year
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:38:45
We can also move all transactions to another crypto and Bitcoin will have ZERO surface of attack.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:17:30
No, its not. Lets get back to reality here. A 2MB hard fork and Segwit are different things. 
The question still stands. Would you back up a 2mb hardfork that also fixes malleability to try to fix the current problems and hate that is going on?
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:49:11
How can you measure that? One node one user?
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:48:05
Why a 2MB would have no technical merit? Coded by the right persons, could be technically perfect
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:01:04
Security in bitcoin depends on the total hashrate of the miners, not on the number of nodes.
A chain will low hashrate will be insecure and, the first weeks, so slow that it's unusable
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:59:55


And how do you measure what users want? Via reddit comments?
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:20:03
Good job, that's the way voting works on Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:59:54
Who told you that you need 3 years for a hard fork? It's way off reality. 
How on hell Core plans to hard fork to a new PoW if they need 3 years? See the inconsistency?
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:56:44
Its kind of a threat, you have a point there.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:56:53
Another way that other user posted, and pretty cool link:
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:44:33
This should not happen. Can we all agree that Bitcoin has a problem?
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:29:55
This is great news, a fork won't help anyone
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:11:38
Mandatory activation doesn't sound very consensus seeking. Nor decentralized.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:08:17
This is the real battle, not node counting/ users/ insults/ whatever. Hashrate!!!
A 80% hasrate chain with 20% of the nodes will be secure, while a 20% hashrate chain with 80% of the nodes will be insecure
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:45:12


One dev suggest something =! Will happen =! It's happening
The author of this post, Core developer, created a proposal to reduce the block size to 300k. Does this means that Core users/Miners/Developers are attacking Bitcoin by reducing the block size and render it useless?
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:43:08
So you think that the number of bitcoin is a "non-critical" factor?
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:39:20
Investment should not be about faith, you are making a mistake.
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:44:05


Witch is a fork. Then we will have 3 chains. Good way to solve the problem!!!

You know what other project is in status quo? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:28:32
I like the malleability fix, I love LN, I don't like the 75% discount. I would like a fair vote on this tech, without all the wars interfering.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:10:07


Hashrate is the best way to vote in Bitcoin. Actually the only one... number of nodes, comments, twitter, etc. are interesting, but can be easily and cheaply manipulated. One CPU one vote, even if now CPUs are mainly ASIC.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:16:44
Are you talking about the 300k block proposal?
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:17:21
I'd say 39%, and [growing] (
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:28:38


That would be my guess, because that's my worry. Bitcoin can sustain external news, cannot be killed from the outside... but could be killed from the inside
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:05:54
BU down also by the same percentage aprox, could it be that some miners switched sides?
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:07:55




You have a point there, looks difficult. Anyway you are fired! :)
Jokes aside, we are in total disagreement over the consequences over a fork. You think is not a big deal, I think is a huge deal, that can kill bitcoin, or make bitcoin the next altavista and another crypto take its place. That is my honest fear, that we are actually killing bitcoin over this.
So I hope your are wrong about the impossibility of a joint proposal, and I hope I am wrong about the consequences of a hardfork
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:08:10
Antagonizing miners is not the way to go, we wont fix anything that way
@_date: 2017-03-31 20:15:00

@_date: 2017-03-31 21:22:41
All of this craziness, last resorts, 1984 talking and war in general, because some narrow-minded ass***** didn't implement a 2MB HF after agreeing to it.
GREAT JOB!!!! IT WENT WELL
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:33:16
A vote system that can be easily manipulated is not representative. You can spin one million nodes, tell them to reject blocks with hashes ending in 43. 
Hashrate on the other hand is expensive, so its not easily manipulated.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:23:14
You may have done a good decision. For me, I'll diversify, and let's see if core/bu/miners can reach an agreement. In that case, I'll buy again
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:09:16
This guy knows math
@_date: 2017-03-31 20:13:17

@_date: 2017-03-18 14:34:39

@_date: 2017-03-16 07:12:23
Too much hate here, BU devs make too many mistakes to take care of Bitcoin, and Core devs act like childs.
Add the miners to the mix and we are killing the chicken that lays golden eggs.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:55:05
Lets ask him
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:30:52
There is a difference between not wanting a fork and supporting Segwit... this is not a binary situation.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:39:27
Wow that's actually acceptable!
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:02:04
Yeah, just 40% of the hashrate is opposing the main implementation, confirmation times are higher than ever, blocks are full, fees higher than ever, everyone fighting everyone.
All good! Nothing to look here!! Keep walking!!
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:48:44
Is this the opinion of ALL Core Developers? 
I think this should be signed by whoever agrees with it, you cannot argue for years that Core is a decentralized group of 400+ devs and then issue "corporate" statements in their name.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:19:57
What was the fee?
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:09:55


wtf are you for real?
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:01:28


No way, look at Litecoin, or any other alt with segwit... why do you think the opposite will happen with Bitcoin?

:( :( :(
Expert troll tho
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:17:09
How is this not unsafe? It may create network splits, reorgs.... like a bad planned hard fork. Without any benefit whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:52:32
I do that a lot. Markets are soooo unpredictable than even when im "almost sure" of something I just act like I'm "half sure" 
It has been a good idea so far!!
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:30:40
Is another twitter poll hard enough?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:08:12
This is a complete misinterpretation of Kraken CEO AND Tur words. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:47:55
Yeah that's the way!! Twitter poll governance!!!
There is no way a Twitter poll can be manipulated, so this is the best way. People talking about governance by markets, hashrate, blockchains and stuff like that are crazy. Twitter is all we need!!!! 
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:28:46
Sorry but that means nothing compared to a twitter poll.
Twitter polls are so secure that all democracies work using them, have you ever seen an election using anything else?
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:40:22
You will create a problem now to prevent the same problem in the future?
Let's burn the house down, it is the only sure way to prevent a fire in the future!!
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:43:32
With Segwit enabled they will have the same problem for 99% of the transactions, segwit only fixes malleability for tx that **only** spend segwit outputs.
Sooooooo segwit will not help!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:04:07

Gavin did more for Bitcoin that many newly arrived crusaders.
@_date: 2017-04-09 11:32:43
I think its Ver, or the other guy, that professor, whoever is the evil today.
@_date: 2017-04-18 16:38:08
So you think that they want to harm Bitcoin? They have invested a lot on Bitcoin, why shoot themselves in the foot?
@_date: 2017-04-18 16:48:56
Let's assume they are actually using covert asicboost. They can still have their mining advantage with SegWit, if that were the case. Just keep mining non-segwit blocks, and enjoy also the pump in price.
So still a shoot in the foot not to signal it. Either they are retarded or they have other reasons.
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:29:27
If segwit does not activate, we need a quick and minimal malleability fix to enable LN.
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:31:16
You could have two chains, and the one with 5% hashrate will be unusable and probably die. Because of the 5%, not because of soft fork
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:17:08
Mining machines work for pools, they dont vote by themselves. You can point them to whatever poll you want
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:46:08
Yet when they mine empty blocks, it's proof of asicboost
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:00:02
So it's not possible because two weeks?
@_date: 2017-04-25 07:02:58
None of them avoid chain split, the last two make it less lilely
@_date: 2017-04-01 06:54:42


Enough with the condescending attitude. That guy deserves respect, edcuate yourself.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:06:15
Counting nodes is a very bad way of representing users. One user can spin cheaply a lot of new nodes, and most of the users don't have a node.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:54:13
Good to see a change in attitude, this is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:55:51
No, I mean 2meg blocks
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:33:16
Well, yes, that party would have a nice competitive advantage. Witch is already the case with electricity prices. Bitcoin will be safe though, because it will still be in their best interest to follow the rules. 
Right now anyone can buy machines from them, so electricity price it's still the main advantage.
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:34:43


Isn't that your opinion... stated as a fact? :)
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:31:55
Yeah nice argument. It's not ad hominen at all.
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:21:27
Everything is an attack on bitcoin lately...
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:59:45
From what I have read, many miners that oppose segwit like LN. I'm a big blocker myself and love where LN is going. Reasonably fast and very cheap transactions on-chain for everyone now, and payment channels for instant, extremely cheap tx in the future. 
I don't think both views are incompatible, but I see your point.
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:24:33
This is crazy. The "other fork" will be bitcoin by every standard that we know of, including exchanges own procedures. Same as they considered BU fork as an altcoin, UASF fork is another altcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:30:03
This is madness
Up is down, we've always been at war with Eastasia, and now 2MB blocks and segwit are the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 05:58:15
Empty blocks are unrelated to asicboost, they are related to SPV mining. SPV mining can actually have a bad impact on the bitcoin network. Asicboost is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:03:06
Chip makers are centralized,only 3, but pools are pretty decentralized, and pools vote, not mining machines. 
By the way, chip makers are way more centralized for other algorithms , basically ATI and nVIDIA. We can choose between Bitmain, Canaan and Bitfury. Last one only for business.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:08:10
Increases surface of attack:
Extension blocks: Check ////
Segwit: Check  ////
Simple hardfork: No
@_date: 2017-04-08 08:09:12
Well this is a configuration issue right? Other pools apart from antpool can implement it, then no more competitive advantage to one pool. Just to one chip maker, witch is not a problem since the hash and voting is controlled by the pools. 
Only problem left is the patent, that is owned by a Core developer and quite nice guy, so I don't think there will be huge problems in using it for a small fee. Sounds about right?
@_date: 2017-04-09 11:41:15
And that is why hash power is a better way to vote than counting business, hash voting is more expensive to fake/buy/coherce than economic majority voting. Also one bitcoin one vote is very good, but way more complicated.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:10:28
Signaling is done on the blocks... I don't get what this new signaling concept is.
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:23:51
We are indeed in disagreement over that point
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:15:38
If no one can detect it how can it be harmful to Bitcoin? Where is the harm? Where is the (bad) impact?
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:18:51
Every miner that I know is making money, return of investment in less than a year with cheap electricity, a lot less with BTC prices over 1000$... 
With expensive electricity (like Europe) then yes, its not a good business.
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:26:10
Again, if it is something harmful to Bitcoin, they will LOSE money if they do it. They will mine more of something less valuable.
If it is NOT harmful, then they will do it for sure. And it will be good for everyone.
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:44:40
Maintain one chain means that only one chain survives. 2-3 blocks per hour means hell for users. Hell for a month.... I don't think so. That chain is dead long before. It gets worse fast with lower %
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:03:53
Increased complexity reduces daily income, those numbers are wrong!
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:55:01
Pretty complex, big surface of attack. How is this different from segwit? No 75% discount???
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:31:14
Ad hominem everywhere... calm down.
Again, there are thousands of miners and they change pools, look at slush statistics:
You can vote for segwit with that pool if you want. More insults won't make your argument better... your are simply wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:04:39
Agree, let's separate the malleability fix from the scaling wars and get Bitcoin ready for LN and future innovations.
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:19:57
That's not true, there are thousands of miners. Majority of them choose a pool basically by how much return they get, and many of them don't even know what segwit is. Search for slush pool users for example (4688
Active Users, only in that one...)
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:01:11
Because its in their best interest not to. If it harms Bitcoin for example. Earning 20% more if Bitcoin loses 30% of the price is bad business. The same reason miners don't try to collude to double spend via 51% attack: their own benefit. This is why Bitcoin is so strong.
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:23:22
They will support both, Slush clarified it
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:40:36
The part related to :
Risks related to complexity and technical debt   and     
Risk of introducing bugs
They are not assessed properly, but the point is clear: both extension blocks and segwit are complex, major changes, and a simple hard fork is not.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:09:52
What do they mean by signaling?
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:04:56
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:28:07
Will the UASF implement replay protection?
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:07:17
That number (95%) is based on what?
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:28:34
You are mistaken, you can buy up to 50 miners at a time. They make new batches every other week. They are making a lot of money out of this....
Also, you can buy Canaan or Bitfury. That last one is more complicated and require high investment.
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:04:33
A soft fork can create two chains, some nodes will enforce one set of rules, other a more restricting one. If any tx lands in between, you got two chains, at any time!
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:45:30

Lets save this comment for the future
@_date: 2017-04-26 10:22:22
Extension blocks and segwit are both complex solutions. Complexity increases the surface of attack for both known and unknown vectors.
A simple hardfork is, well, simpler, and thus the surface of attack will increase less.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:07:49
That would likely create a fork, more miners need to be on it first. A post some weeks ago gave numbers, and about 80%+ of the hashrate is needed to maintain only one chain.
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:05:57
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:05:45
EDIT: didn't know about BIP 140
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:03:46
Yeah, let's ignore and reject everything reasonable until there is no more Bitcoin and we can all continue with our lives.
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:29:22
Why do you think Bitfinex itself (with corporate account in other exchanges) is not doing this arbitrage?
@_date: 2017-04-26 10:23:56
Yes it does. Run the numbers with a 15% increase in difficulty every two weeks and see for yourself. For example in week 1 and week 3
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:06:10
Empty blocks are about using their hashrate even when previous block is not fully validated, not about asicboost
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:26:57
I don't even understand this new bitcoin drama.
ELI5 anyone?
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:01:53
I heard they eat babies for breakfast
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:23:35
No, he cannot,it  is extremely expensive to do that. That is why bitcoin is secure.
He sells machines to other people, that is his business.  Many people buy them and mine in antpool, bitmain's pool, that is why is one of the biggest. But far from a 50%. With those machines you can also mine in any other pool and vote for segwit if you want.
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:17:39
No, enough with the 1984 language. Segwit is 1mb block + other stuff. 2mb block is 2mb block. This is getting crazy
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:03:26
That's wealth created by the project, not by trading their shares/tokens
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:18:21
Only if they make the right move. 
They *can* make money when it goes both up and down, AND they *can* lose money when it goes up and down
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:29:15
You'll have your own comments (silently) removed at some point, just wait &amp; see for yourself
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:24:04
Many people call other people names on the Bitcoin community, we can have dozens of posts like this per hour.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:29:47
I don't know if it will be linear or not tbh
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:16:05
So Bitcoin Cash is dead?
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:49:02
That's a win-win for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:51:50
That's 3% per month... with that rate it will **literally** take years!!
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:37:30
That's the community? Github?
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:07:31
If someone does the same in a blockchain that scales properly, there is no issue
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:15:10


They transfer wealth from other people to them then.
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:34:17
Another twitter poll coming?
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:18:14
Agree, individuals can win or lose, while the system as a whole does not create wealth
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:03:28
Trading is a 0 sum game. No new wealth is created.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:57:09


Or all the nodes get wiped out by a 0day.... or modified enough so that they *all* continue to operate in a malicious way. 
Good thinking there m8!!!
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:48:34
New target for the kill-the-character campaign?
Hey guys, get the pitchforks!!!
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:32:13
Fake news, they mined the last ones with:
/BTCC/ Support /NYA/
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:04:04
And he knows this because....
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:02:25
Miners will keep their mined bitcoins, economic nodes wont use an insecure chain
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:01:44
99% of them are illegitimate use cases and thus SPAM, we only need 300kb block size for the next few years, we should decrease blocksize. 
ILEGITIMATE use cases include paying stuff with bitcoin, sending bitcoin, receiving bitcoin, mining bitcoin (i'm watching you chinese guys), this is SPAM
LEGITIMATE use cases include HODL and writing  tweets
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:16:19
Holy cow, have you heard of Blockstream?
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:16:14
You fight for the users by not giving them the option to actually choose?
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:51:26
It's SPV mining, not related to asicboost.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:37:45
Yeah keep moving the goalpost!
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:03:45
Changes economic incentives model with 75% discount to some bytes. Also, it's way more complex than needed, harming security and future development.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:00:55
Mine empty blocks, release them at the same time, overwriting the shorter chain. Trust in the shorter chain is zero then, no more shorter chain, only one chain, thus chain split risk mitigated.
No economic node will ever operate in a chain that can easily be overwritten like this, imagine an exchange that sends you $$$ for your bitcoins, and then 15 blocks later... your bitcoins are back into your address....
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:44:54
Just like... a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:58:59
This is one of the best arguments PRO bigger blocks out there. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:46:45
This can easily create a chain split, don't play with fire!
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:54:45
Then it's not BIP148, its normal Segwit activation. No risk of fork.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:58:19
Agree, but then no enforcement whatsoever. Makes no sense to call it a scenario of BIP148. If the miners activate segwit before Aug, there is no BIP148.
If they don't, then orphan non-segwit signaling blocks and fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:14:28
This explains a lot that was going on lately...
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:04:16
With 1% of the hashrate, BIP148 chain will have one block each 16.6 HOURS for MONTHS, so dead chain anyway. To survive, a sizeable amount of hashrate is needed.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:32:25
Yeah let's character assassinate another one!!!!
WHOHOOOO!!!!! UASF!!!!!!!!!111oneone
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:22:11
Well, I would not interpret that message as Bitcoin.com is backing out of anything. The title is misleading
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:06:30
So they will support both chains and let users choose or not?
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:14:44
This. "Normal" transactions will have higher fees than "Segwit" transactions due to the discount that NO ONE asked for. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:00:38
If not, what would happen in November?
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:37:50


Yes it does!! In a change of PoW old miners are useless, new ones fundamental. In any other case, old ones are fundamental. No miners, no blockchain!!
In the same PoW, what if they do not "play along"? Then you have no chain, or if a minority (Bitfury) plays along, you'll have one block each week. And the others can kill the chain any time, so extremely insecure. No economic node will trust a chain that is not secure.
My point is, miners are fundamental
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:11:20
That would be a centralized coin. One CPU one vote its as decentralized as its gets.
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:24:58
Bip140 is simpler. Fixes mall and doesn't change economics. Sooooo yeah
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:57:57
You don't need segwit then, just blocksize increase and a simpler malleability fix.
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:17:20
What an amazing time to live in 
:D :D :D
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:50:39
Miners want big blocks, so they don't want to keep tx throughput low...  the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:32:33
Here you go, Core developer supporting the most dangerous experiment on Bitcoin history. 
....but no HF because... reasons.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:53:37
That's good adversarial thinking! Way to go, keep it up.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:22:47
xMB block doesn't imply xMB transactions. xMB block and bip 140 does everything useful from segwit and it's simpler and cleaner.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:56:13
You are right. But it is in their best interest not to do it, maintain the usability of Bitcoin as much as possible and allow Bitcoin to grow.
This is why they want bigger blocks. Their interest is aligned with the growth of the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:16:23
Empty blocks are related to SPV mining
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:23:59
Yes, they are looking for their own interest. As expected, and desired. This is bitcoin's strength. They have incentives aligned with the network's best interest.
As long as they are smart and selfish, we are safe.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:57:28
That has nothing to do with efficiency. Also, limiting tx size also does this.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:44:30


That's the definition of Bitcoin now? Please... stop trying to fork bitcoin. This reckless attitude is damaging everyone.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:14:45
That's a good definition of BIP148, boycott of non-signaling blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:47:01
Or reduce the block to 300k **NOW** and hard fork to 1.1 MB on 2096 if and only if the entire community reaches a consensus, I mean the **ENTIRE** community, 100% of all the people who hold bitcoin, did hold bitcoin, use bitcoin or have heard of it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:12:02
Outcome 4) BIP148 loses fast is not even contemplated?
Right now no miner has expressed support for BIP148, witch means no chain at all, no matter how many nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:32:05
This is getting crazy.... a HF has nothing to do with miner support? WTF
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:27:43
BIP 140 is simpler and no discounts. But LOL at the image
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:43:12
It always has been. HF with 95% miner support is very safe. UASF is an atomic bomb with no way to measure.
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:54:33
4MB is more than enough.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:56:33
Well, maybe no one will do it. But the strong selling point of bitcoin is that its secure with every player acting in his own selfish interest. No need to be nice, it just works!
If a chain is secure because "people will be nice"... then it's not secure at all. Even if people are nice in the end.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:41:28
Let's HF already FFS
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:20:01
I don't get it, they proposed segwit and said that its a blocksize increase. What are you thanking them for exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:49:11
Yeah much better. Simpler, more secure, more miner support.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:24:17
Lets say you have 5% of the actual hash power and I have 10%, we are the only players. I start mining empty blocks and not releasing them for a time, you keep business as ususal. In some hours, I will have a chain of empty blocks double the size of your chain. I release all of them at the same time, every node will swich to the longest chain by default, thus killing your shorter chain.
Shorter chains are inherently insecure, and every exchange on earth knows it.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:42:36
Yeah let's fork bitcoin, what could go wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:28:58
So they will support the forks they like and not support the ones they don't like. 
Fair enough for me, just don't coat it like your are doing it for higher reasons
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:22:19
And they never get mined because blocks are full. A 2MB block will not be vulnerable.
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:05:52
That number keeps increasing, maybe in a couple of weeks its 5MB
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:24:31
After that screenshot, i don't think so
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:48:51
Not sure if serious or trolling... anyway HF has nothing to do with what you say. Zero.
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:06:08
You, him, are ALL waiting? My god the pressure.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:43:59
Amazing that a full node can be run in a raspberry pi. 
More amazing that we have been unable to scale, given the previous fact.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:10:56
He didn't sign the agreement, so...
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:44:53
No complaints on the shill part eh?
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:43:52
WOW 1.890429 MB! Almost like a 2MB HF
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:03:14
There is no good way to define consensus across the comnnity. When do you UASF? What do you measure?
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:26:04
The whole idea of counting nodes its flawed, and everything on top, including that assumption. 
Having said so, setting an activation day its a good idea. Now we need a way to enforce that activation, or not, based on a good measurement. For example, a fair future contract.
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:48:46
Who is we?
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:59:45
That's not true, only ONE tx that spends segwit's anyone can spend output and there will be split! (that transaction will be TOTALLY valid for all normal nodes, only bit148 nodes will reject it!!!)
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:33:22
SegWit does not make ASICboost incompatible... repeating something a thousand times does not make it true.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:27:25
This argument is like saying:
Hey, this blocksize stuff is too complicated, don't even think about it!!
Let other people think for you!!! (same guys who said blocks won't be full for years btw)
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:12:39
Ohhhh an engineer!!! (reverence) 
Same engineer that believes that the earth is flat? Or that we need 300kb blocks for the next years? Or is this a different engineer? Maybe he's just a wizard (double reverence)
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:22:45
On chain scaling should be our first option, an then off chain. 
Bitcoin should be able to compete with Lykke, Blockstream and other companies that are providing alternative payment options and making them part of their business.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:51:35
Oh my, so much hate in this thread!
He is pointing out that in the genesis block, the first crypto coins ever got distributed. No need to get the pitchforks
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:48:56
Search what those people said in the past, specially the ones that are being very vocal now. Then decide for yourself if they deserve your trust.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:27:52
Some say there is no problem in paying 7$ for a tx. Bitcoin is not for coffee
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:33:09
GPUs are for mining other cryptos, not Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:21:24
Yeah, it will force a HF to bigger blocks once and for all
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:19:18
Unfairly != too
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:52:00
It's money. A type of money better than fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:21:52
Would it had mattered if OP bought at 5.2$ instead of $5? Buy what your are not afraid to lose and wait some years.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:09:46
Not even the covert
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:38:00
Yeah let's keep moving the goalpost
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:20:23
Some wish it will be an peer to peer electronic cash system again
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:20:45
There is no consensus on Segwit2x?? and there is for Segwit??
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:02:29


This guy totally gets bitcoin, and its security model.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:32:11
Old timers are more relaxed because they are already rich, no merit there.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:25:35
Agree. It should be useful for that too.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:03:31
What does BIP148 have to do with the blocksize debate? Really?
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:22:02
4$ it's not a micro-payment. 4 cents it's a micro-payment.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:26:16
If BIP148 gains up to 10% miner support, they will be able to process one block each 1.5 hours for months.
(so far miner support is less than 1% for BIP148)
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:15:15
I'm making references to crazy things those "engineers" said in the past. And by engineers I mean some core devs. 
You want the same people that said that $3 fees will never happen, (and then when they happened changed the narrative to say that they are ok) to decide the block size?
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:56:54
That's your call then. No shame in being new to crypto though, and most people have no idea of the nutjobs they are following to BIP148 craziness. 
If you know and are ok with that, kudos.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:50:50
The entire community being measured by what, another twitter poll?
