Not really. Why would someone lend money without receiving interest on the loan?

I can recommend bitbargain if you're in the uk .. been around for years and lets you choose miner fee when you withdraw

Thanks, great explanation. Wouldn't the sudden realisation that tether is worthless cause people to panic buy other crypto,  increasing the price of everything else?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:45:39
All the whales bet on bitcoin futures that the price will go down then start dumping their coins..

There's loads of Bitcoin apps in the app store though? Or is this specifically Bitcoin payment apps?

And what is the consensus, Friday or Monday?

People are selling just in case the etf isn't approved (the most likely scenario)
If the etf gets approved expect a sharp price increase as everyone buys back in.

Thanks. So only if adequate replay protection is provided by BU developers.
Ok So, in the event of a hardfork without the replay protection request being met, presumably BTU will still be traded on other exchanges that didn't sign the letter (poloniex etc) .. in this instance would Bitstamp's BTC price likely mirror the winning chain on those other exchanges?

Which wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:47:45
Does this help
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:14:02
Yeah I'm out for now.
Support for BU is nearly at 40% and rising so I think a hard fork is definately on the cards resulting in a price dip in the short term while they fight it out. 
I think BTC will eventually come out on top though and implement segwit,  that's when I'm buying back in

Lol... Washington I presume?
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:02:48
Ok thanks! :)

Guys, if I currently hold five bitcoin on Bitstamp, in the event of a hardfork I will see 5BTC and 5BTU balance right?
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:37:46
if you need the transaction to be confirmed urgently and the transaction hasn’t been relayed you can try signing the transaction again but this time adding a higher fee. Coinb.in offers great tools to help you sign, broadcast, verify, and create new transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:42:44
Why is a hard fork impossible?
&lt;edit&gt; by the way I'm not trolling, I don't understand the debate fully and I'm still holding all my coins
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:09:20
Yeah same here in the UK, thanks Brexit :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:28:43
It's a valid criticism, but I'd be interested in an energy usage comparison with a fiat banking system - I.e. the energy costs of building, maintaining, heating &amp; cooling every bank building in the world...the skypscrapers, branches, offices, vaults.. the cost of all the cars bank employees use to drive to and from work each day.. security vans, fraud prevention, cash machine maintenance etc..
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:16:00
Ok thanks! ��
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:14:18
Am I right in thinking there is a decision today on the bitcoin ETF?
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:25:18
Ahh .. was just going by this article, mentions October 13th, presumed with that being a Sunday it would be today ..
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:15:51
In the same way that Netscape Navigator dying meant nobody was able to surf the internet?
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:34:23
The core chain won't die, but it's value could go lower than bitcoin cash in the  future. Theres nothing to say that this scenario would be permanent though, competition is healthy.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:41:22
I didn't know that actually, thanks. Ok bad example, but my point is the trailblazer rarely remains dominant in its field and it would be surprising if BTC did manage to hang on to the number one slot indefinitely. BTC ranking second out of 1100 tokens wouldn't necessarily kill the concept of it being a reliable store of value.

Mostly VeriBlock testing ..

Last I heard it was 18 months away but I've seen a few threads claiming an unfinished version is up and running, plus bitbargain (an exchange i is regularly use) has added support for it so .. perhaps things are moving quicker ..
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:46:02
This is possible. But if you study the previous two bubbles before the 2014/2014 one, it didn't crash so hard, roughly landed halfway down and continued the rally. All depends on news I guess, if lightening network is implemented faster than anticipated 5k/6k may be the bottom
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:15:43
$1,850/$2,966 region sounds realistic
@_date: 2015-09-01 06:50:38
Why is everyone so against Blockchain wallets? I've stored coins in there for years without issue..
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:46:11
It's just like sending emails to an email address except instead of the address being aname the address is a long string like 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX.
Easiest way to buy some is head over to  and make an account
Good luck!
