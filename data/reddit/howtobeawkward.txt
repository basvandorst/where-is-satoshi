I posted same thing the other day. Immediately I had like seven people jump down my throat saying you're dumb. The most productive answer I got was that mtgox is an exchange whereas coinbase is more of a virtual storefront (you don't buy/sell from other people you buy/sell to coinbase). I would expect some price disparity from this because it adds security and guarantees (unless they run out as has happened) the purchase/sale at any time.
However, I still feel the difference is high. Also believe the difference should be incorporated into their service costs rather than the price, but that would be a bad business model. Oh well I'm just happy we are going up.

Quick question... I've been watching live stream of WWDC. What is the news that would affect bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:30:32
make sense. one is a middle man and one is an exchange. Am i right here? Gap still seems high
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:26:55
Perfect example of a completely unhelpful response... educate me
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:58:01
I also read somewhere that the majority of third party payment providers stopped immediately so that wouldn't affect much... but then again I don't have any proof of that. will look for reddit comment
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:59:24
Oh you're that guy
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:08:17
I will also add that it is really interesting how coinbase no longer shows the amount of USD they are selling at (implied buying price) anymore. I would guess this is because people like you and me see mtgox value vs. coinbase value and say "why?"

One of the many class actions that is popping up: 
also fraud makes you liable, pretty big case for this
but do you really think there will be no legal action for someone who just loses almost half a billion dollars worth of bitcoin or anything with that kind of value?
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:10:09
Its like the telephone game where people just repeat others

this sub is unstable and disruptive with all these memes

just for my knowledge: what are we waiting on in China? Is this just a valuation/demand thing? I know they are banning yuan deposits and alibaba is blocking it but these were awhile ago. is there any other event I should be watching in China?
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:19:12
i'm not a weirdo, you're a weirdo
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:43:26
where in anything did i say do you think i want government control? I want businessmen running multi-million dollar exchanges to have some semblance of competence and prevent known issues with already communicated fixes. And when they are CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT, the legal system will deal with them as it does will do with all businesses bitcoin or otherwise
....good try trololololol

Feel like I'm talking to myself but its back that was quick maybe it was a bug or something
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:15:26
Will sell my bitcoin for $9000 right now for anyone interested... they are going to be worth $10k so you know this is a bargain
