They [definitely are]( The miners draw very high amounts of power and they run at pretty high temperatures. There are maybe a few failure modes that can cause a contained fire on the device I believe. Not sure how likely these are, but the probability is definitely non-zero.

There's also this nasty little catch in their contract that says that if the price falls low enough that daily payouts don't cover per day costs for 20 days then they automatically cancel your _"lifetime"_ contracts.
Nothing short of highway robbery if you ask me. I very much regret ever doing business with them after they canceled the bulk of my contracts in the period just after the halvening.

True, good catch. Amazing how easy it is to assume these things in your head but then mix them up in writing.

Agreed. It was a valiant attempt but if you put yourself in the shoes of a newcomer there was a lot of heavy content covered in here. The most poignant newb-friendly explanation I've seen so far is [this recent TED Talk]( by MIT Media Lab's Neha Narula. She does a good job of nailing that complex balance of 'how' &amp; 'why'.

Ah it looks like you're asking more 'meta' than 'nut-and-bolts' questions here. I'll take a stab at answering some of these.




No, bitcoin exists as a protocol not as a program. Think of it like this: the protocol is like a _**new language**_ with very specific rules in it. The protocol states that roughly every 10 minutes a certain new amount of bitcoin will be created according to it's [pre-determined supply function]( This new bitcoin can be created anywhere in the world by any piece of software that can _**plug into the bitcoin protocol and speak its language**_. 
For more on how the actual process of creation happens, I'd recommend [this video](


Bitcoin's code is really just an implementation of the ideas laid out in the original whitepaper: _those specific rules that make up this new language_. Anyone with an understanding of those rules and of how they could be implemented could then write the code to implement those and connect all the dots to create Bitcoin. Important to note here is that while Bitcoin itself is novel, the techniques it draws on have been around for years e.g. Hashchains, proof-of-work consensus, public key cryptography etc.


Bitcoin has some very strong ideological roots. It is the result of a long history of experimenting with ideas of free (non gov't-controlled) money and cryptography. These ideas were pioneered by a movement that called themselves 'Cypherpunks' and up until Bitcoin all previous attempts had largely failed. When Bitcoin was released in Jan 2009, this group of persons recognised Bitcoin as another attempt at what they were working towards that actually worked and Bitcoin spread through that community. Bitcoin then grew _in waves_ among different communities, roughly something like:
* 2009 - 2011: Cypherpunk types
* 2011 - 2013: Libertarian minded folks, and technical folks seeking profit through mining
* 2013 on: Organic growth from the realisation of Bitcoin's potential by wider communities of persons
There's a decent visual account of Bitcoin's history at [historyofbitcoin.org](


Transactions are verified by nodes who pass along transactions when they are first created in the network. These nodes do basic cryptographic checks to ensure two things mainly: 
* That the sender actually owns those bitcoins
* That those bitcoins have not been spent as yet
Once these two criteria are met, the transactions are then passed along the network from node to node until they reach the miners who add the transactions to the permanent record (blockchain).

Very cool. Have you checked out the [Bitcoin Caribbean group]( on Facebook yet?
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:22:04
This is pretty awesome! I made a packet and [shared it]( to our local Bitcoin Facebook group for exposure. Tip to you for doing this.
*Edit: [tip just deposited]( ;)*
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:29:21
Lol, that's ok. Actually if you're up for it,  it would be fun if you could post a new packet back to the group to show how easy it is to transfer btc (like how you found it just lying around through reddit).

Hi thanks for the awesome work guys. I participated in a few of the first Wasabi joins myself.
Question on size of anonymous outputs created. Are there any plans to have variably-sized outputs for folks who want to mix coins that are either much larger or much smaller than the current ~0.1 BTC limits?
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:57:55
Thanks. So that's 8 months and counting without any fix then...

Thanks for jumping on here to answer q's. I was wondering, is Circle USD similar to the mechanisms behind Bitreserve USD/Tether/Coinapult Locks? And if so, why is it that the feature isn't as widely available with you all as it is with these other services (specifically Tether &amp; Bitreserve)?
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:26:31
Just found when this was posted on this sub ( Reading through those comments now, apologies for repost folks.

You've got your work cut out for you across there in B'dos my friend! @_date: 2015-09-28 04:57:50
I wrote [this blogpost]( a little while back that shared similar sentiments. You might enjoy ;)
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:58:18
This seems pretty comprehensive, thanks!
@_date: 2015-09-28 13:53:30
Ah ok. So in a nutshell then, is it that with Circle the added benefit is that I can convert my CircleUSDcoin to actual USD on the fly, whereas with others it's only that the actual value is locked in to Bitcoin-as-the-medium but tied to USD for the valuation (i.e. it's not convertible to actual fiat)?

    block 18: handsomechandler sent vindard $0.50 previous: 006dd4576d6205a07b53fe8b353c05d3081e5b7e4abcd76a0c29a714a4c80c54 solution: 2

Is this game still going? Great project! I dropped the difficulty for block 18 because of lack of miners. 
*EDIT: Found these solutions too while trying to reach for higher difficulty: 146, 301, 4221.*
