Or you cant step back and see the big picture, that Satoshi's vision and start was amazing but its not set in stone for eternity and technology changes.  When Nick Szabo who started the precursor to Bitcoin says the big block argument is politics and offchain is the way to scale to visa like transactions, maybe its a good time to rethink your dogma.   The market has spoke, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash has gone off to do its own thing with its centralized Alibaba nodes, maybe it should be a big boy and get it's own twitter handle instead of deceiving people and claiming to be Bitcoin when it's sold everywhere as Bitcoin Cash.

They will be the first to leave crypto and swear it off when their shitcoin (TRON cough cough) shits the bed and they lose a ton of money because they couldn't research.   These people aren't buying a phone, they're investing in what they think will help them make more money, yes it's on them but saying investing in shitty coins is a good thing is ridiculous.

We needed a correction, we had a massive run, future contracts volume is pretty dismal, no conspiracy here yet.

All you need is your seed words worst case, even if the company goes out of business its a bip so you can figure out your private keys worst possible case.

Get a password manager like lastpass, when you visit the site if you dont see the little number or notification saying you have a stored account there dont use it. Its easy and a good habit to get into.

What's that papa?
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:28:23
He's also very anti so doesn't hold much weight and the way it works is the more people use it the better it gets.  I have been using it and dropping fees dramatically. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:25:07
Looking at your post history you're a Bitcoin hater with the same old talking points, enjoying the brigading from altcoin holders and boys, they're scared.  Yes there are scaling issues, every coin is running into them, there are amazing upgrades in the works, so if you believe in Bitcoin chill and realize it's still new and working towards it's goals, if not just keep pushing your agenda. 
Edit: Seems I triggered the FUD boys. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:09:29
Hah, that would dope I'm in, get someone trustworthy in the community like Andreas or someone to hold the funds.

What does P2P payments tell you about the motive behind Bitcoin on a basic level?
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:31:30
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:51:31
You realize Satoshi created Bitcoin because the bank bailouts and that's why people started to pour into it.  It's goal is decentralization and not relying on banks, you guys really need to research more. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:04:51
Took me 3 hours to send a transaction with high gas lol, ETH shills give Bitcoin shit but their network is halted by kitties.

@_date: 2018-01-09 22:43:18
Uhh, do you not see they're pushing Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin, little different there in false advertising and pretending to be Bitcoin.   They should have a Bitcoin Cash twitter handle but they wouldnt have that many followers so they gotta be sneaky.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:27:25
No such thing as bitcoin core, there is Bitcoin and BCH Bubba. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:28:59
Don't know what to tell you, I sent from MEW to Gemini with high gas and it took 3 hours.  I own both BTC and ETH equal and have nothing to shill, I just hate when people aren't genuine about ETH's problems. Gemini also tells you when it first hits and then it confirms so it's not on Gemini's side. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:51:19
Any idea if I can run a LN node with a raspberry pi? Also, does it take a lot of bandwith to run?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:36:34
You can "believe" in Bitcoin and realize what it's done for decentralization and it's big picture, it doesn't have any goals? You haven't been here long have you.

Ya, cryptsy took my what would be million in dash, fuck big vern!
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:57:12
So why the rabbid need to come into a Bitcoin sub and shit on it instead of improving your coin or sticking to stocks? It's just funny most the public doesn't see the fees as big an issue as the people with ulterior motives, just funny how obvious this is. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:58:23
They should care about cheaper and faster.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:38:01

Senators have been coming out about the anonymous factor of crypto, dont like that I could see them going after Monero, it will still be around but hard to trade it and will probably hurt the price, still love Monero though.   BTC, ETH and Factom are my solids, that will survive a bubble most likely.

True, but it's on mainet now, so that's pretty exciting. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:44:05

Believe it when I see it, even then the whole BCH blind side out of nowhere when they said Jan 1st withdraw only was the last straw, the CEO did it out of politics. Fuck them, Gemini and Bistamp is better for Bitcoin and it's future.

With all the new people coming in it's only right to make things clear for them, that would suck to lose money. This is the right move for exchanges, probably saves them a lot in customer support tickets too.

Crypto and blockchain ain't going nowhere, if you look into the technology coming out it's mind blowing and the companies investing in it is only going up.   Younger people prefer to invest in crypto more than traditional markets, it's only going to keep shifting over-time.  That doesn't mean Bitcoin can't fail, it just means crypto currency is here to stay and will overtake traditional markets it's only a matter of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:43:39

Looking at your history it looks like you're a regular Tether FUD'ster and sky is falling in general.  Not saying this isn't possible but I would take it with a grain of salt, if they are giving a warrant it could just be for high value users like Coinbase had to do, point is we just don't know yet.

I see them now on here, i click them so he loses money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:38:39
I don't think they discussed the specifics of it, they're just laying ground work so you can't money launder. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:44:41
Maybe you should look into bcash, they seem to pump things out fast without regard to contemplation and extensive testing, seems the better coin for what you're looking for. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:09:34

I heard a story the other day about [George Westinghouse]( that saw a train accident in front of him.   Trains used to take a mile to 2 miles to stop and would cause a lot of accidents.  George decided he was going to create air brakes, the whole world laughed at him and said he's an idiot, you can't use air to stop a train stupid bastard. Nobody would invest, they all ignored him until he scraped up enough money to do a demo.   He then showed it was possible and money started pouring in and he became the richest mother fucker around and nobody laughed anymore.   
We see this over and over again, people need authority figures to tell them something is good, they can't see possibilities on their own most the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:16:01

@_date: 2017-12-24 06:29:28
At least Bitcoin Gold you can mine with a gpu, a lot of miners mining it.   It's not Bitcoin but it's hell of a lot better than that bch shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:25:24
Kinda hard when miners block Segwit for years.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:44:37

Also, my first reaction was to check how Bitcoin was trading in Korea.  It had a sharp decline **very shortly** and then back to normal while the US markets were still going down some, so that kind of told me they didn't see it as a big deal, just another tool to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:00
Yup, he officially hates bitcoin and is playing politics.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:25:28
They do, people that want to short need to hedge with real coins right?

Yup, follow the CEO on twitter and it's obvious he doesn't care about progress, he pushes his ETH and big blocks.   They have too much power and is bad for Bitcoin going forward, tell everyone to stay away, besides that the fees are ridiculous there. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:37:29
Tough part though is the US markets kept going down, so you would get a discount but hard to time how low they lag behind. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:46:56
You're everywhere subtly pushing this Bcash, everyone tag and downvote this concerned troll. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:57:47
So many haters and troll in here now that don't take a minute to look at the technology.   Guess all the new press brings out the jealousy in people. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:43:41
Holy shit I can't believe he has Hitler's wallet in the future!

I CAN'T TAKE THE LAUGH TRACKS......
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:25:55
You guys.....I think you need to read up on upgrades and what's next.  Faster cheaper fees, it will take over this money printing greed we're seeing and it will be glorious.   Some of you just can't see what's in front of you yet, but that makes it that much better. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:30:48
Uh ya, can we get more of these than price posts thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:01:22
The 1% owns half the worlds wealth of course they pay a lot, Warren Buffets secretary still pays more of a percentage than him in taxes, sounds fair enough eh?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:11:19
Skycoin is trying to do that, ex bitcoiners working on it, pretty interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:34:28
So Brian Armstrong gave up his hard on for big blocks? Good to hear, probablyb only because its better for his business but I'll take it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:49:53
Lol, nice one stalker.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:41:08
Oh shit! The biggest regurgitated talking points from the haters are going out the door.

There is an orinization that focuses on investigative journalism, we really need that these days with our shitty media news, dont have time to find it but will post it later if nobody else does.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:20:14
Ya I just saw his username at first and it disturbed me so I asked him about it and saw a couple of his posts history.   He didn't seem like a troll account, he seemed genuinely depressed from his other posts so I got concerned for the guy and would randomly message him and he always said "nah man I'm good don't worry". 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:48:31
You rang?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:53:19
His ego is getting in the way.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:02:24
You were right. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:57:27
Nice one! This is also how Bitcoin gets spread out to new people, old time users cash out at their price points and new users get to get in on the action.    That's a pretty good strategy to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:15:09
Pretty sure it is, Brian Armstrong is constantly on Twitter pushing ETH and big blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:44:08
Or after, my favorite chart that's still right 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:04:58
It's only gone up but there were bear markets that lasted over a year, I don't think that will happen now with institutional money getting in.   I think we see 20k again in January at some point but nothing is for sure and what the fuck we're you thinking mortgaging your house for something so volatile? I hope you're trolling. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:21:36
And then they realize thats just a dumb talking point most the time and get their pizza quick and cheap, ya my favorite part! Oh I could watch that over and over.

Ah interesing, ok sorry didnt know that.  Congrats on your mew found money!
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:46:07
Yes, irritates the shit out of me when people don't put the 2013 bubble into context.  Only 1 exchange doing almost all of your volume crashes is pretty damn huge, plus the volume was nowhere near where we're at now.  Not saying we can't crash but it really is different this time.

Well yes, I should have taken the higher road like Andreas, got upset when this arrogant guy poor shames and lashes out at someone so good to Bitcoin that never says a bad word about anyone.  Good thing I'm just some dumb redditor and not a Bitcoin representative but yes, two wrongs don't make a right.

@_date: 2017-12-05 20:33:16
Fuck ya, I think these people probably had parents and a fallback safety net to help them worst case.   You don't go through stressful jobs and lack of ability to pay bills and say money isn't important at all.  Unless you can be happy living in a van which some people can so props to them but a lot of us don't want to do that.

This is a normal pattern, some big sell walls on btc to chew through, nothing out of the ordinary we just had a massive rise, consolidation and chopping sideways is good before the next run up.

This is why the community really needs to stop referring people to Coinbase and explain their high fees, these guys are too political, they're not implementing Segwit over political bias. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:39
I think you mean run to your centralized power to regulate your centralized exchange, yes that sounds about right.   I don't know how your simple mind can't comprehend that.

Nah, she wouldnt be able to send anything if she did, lol sorry too soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:20
Gemini and bitstamp is way better, been using them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:39:52
This is why the big exchanges need Segwit, complain to them.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:24:17

@_date: 2017-12-02 19:43:20

@_date: 2017-12-05 05:30:55
Oh man, i wonder if he was   But he was a regular in bitcoinmarkets and was really depressed over getting out of bitcoin.  We kept telling him to get in at like 1500k a coin and he thought it was too late.   He said he was an engineer, his final post said he didnt ever have a girlfriend and couldn't do anything right.   He said only thing good he could do was brush his teeth so it was his last brush :(   A lot of us kelt trying to get through to the guy but he just was set on doing something in 2017, it was really sad hearing and feeling helpless to notify someone.   Either way, I'm sorry for your loss, I lost a brother to drug abuse, nothing like losing someone too early.  
Edit: Got the username backwards so updated it, but I think this was a different guy after reading his posts again.

Ya but why get a coinbase account for a reddit currency? This isnt adding up here.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:43:49
They're already doing that, they just copy everything and change a few lines, shitty devs already messed up their eda, dont know how people put their trust in 1 full-time dev.

Tell him its like a finite amount of gold you can send over the interwebz.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:46:29
It was so damn frustrating and sad too, we all wanted him to get back in a do well or let go of the past but he was just in this crazy negative loop by that time that nothing would work.  A lot of us tried everything we could because we could feel the desperation but he was set on it ending, just sucks and feel bad for the parents and family. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:41:26
Keep trolling brah, cuz your shitcoin can't stand on it's own. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:03:26
If you follow him on twitter for a day you will see how political and dividing he is.  Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitpay and many others already implemented it, they're saying its easy to do, hes being a political dbag, besides ths t they rape people with fees, screw them.

@_date: 2017-12-14 06:21:36
It only has 1 full-time dev, no real innovatio  besides bigger blocks that can only take you so far.   We need lighting or other innovations to compete with Visa.   Their devs don't seem to compitent either, I wouldnt touch it bit he's good at fooling noobs. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:02:39
When CME, the NASDAQ and the biggest financial institutions are getting in, which they are, those are the mother fuckers running the government, I don't see them banning it on all that lost money potential.

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:48:54
Ya 2008 worked out pretty well for people, when will people realize you can only print monwy for so long.  What's so crazy about wanting to be your own bank and watch after your own money.  I understand not wanting to go all in but it's pretty ignorant to not want to hedge with something like this.   People screamed the internet was a fad that was goijg to fail, this is the same deal.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:22:01

They are until we start to get decentralized exchanges that are already in the works.  He will be fine, he's rich as fuck now but they know Segwit and new upgrades will put them out of business, not for a long while though I agree.

It's funny when people mention the 2013 bubble they forget to mention there was only 1 exchange that did 80% of sales.   This time IS different, no really.     We will still correct and dip but its not going anywhere, hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:18:18

You don't understand one plays politics and tried to prop up a shitty altcoin through misleading tactics and the other did not, I agree most people should move to Bitstamp but Gemini is at least the lesser of the two evils and actually works better with less downtime. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:51:13
It's a Bitcoin sub! Does ethereum sub talk about ETC? Maybe but i never see it.  is a bch circle jerk, plenty of talk there about it.  BCH people seem to hate Bitcoin and it's devs so why give them a platform to troll and cause confusion, every sub moderates.

This is my problem with straight libertarian thinking, you think people will just volunteer money to help people or build roads.  I can't even get my neighbors to help with the private road, how the hell would anything get taken care of.   Sometimes it's good to help the elderly and those in need, rising tide lifts all boats.   I like certain parts of Libertarianism but most the time it's fuck you I got mine.

All the mainstream channels are the worst but fox wins hands down for creating the dumbest people that think they're getting "news".    John Stossel is also a pretty smug d-bag but I give him credit for being one of the earliest guys to like Bitcoin.   But its funny to see their mindset changing, they used to say its only for drug dealers and money laundering and now they like it? Lol, someone got some Bitcoin.

Bitcoin drops a bit or corrects and fud boy inc comes out, they're desperate.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:02:21
Long as you pay taxes their good, they just want a piece.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:37:50
He's always on the extreme spectrum, just ignore it and use Segwit.

It's p2p and everyone can open a hub.

Technology goes faster than stocks, so we might see a big pull back but probably wouldnt last long.

Traditional Investors Triggered!! (TIT)
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:20:23
Anything is possible but its not "crashing" soon, it corrects and drops some of course, always has and what we might see.   
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:03:16
Everyone and their grandmother can open one, so yes p2p and totally decentralized :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:40
He shouldn't have insulted you they make us look bad.   Look, their are big upgrades thar are making it a cheaper and faster currency.   Futures will make it less volatile and legitimizes crypto to the skeptics.   We are in the first inning, does that mean we aren't in a bubble? No, anything can happen but look what happen to the tech bubble afrer the fact and technology is 10x faster, I dont see a long recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:49:01
Ah yes, gotcha.   s&amp;p isn't going anywhere, but what's interesting is you will start to see blockchain in real companies all over.  Whether that blockchain uses Bitcoin's network or not will be seen but there are already people working hard at doing just that. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:15:57
Ya! I though I would have my lambo today! /s
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:00:19
I know shapeshift dude, who's been pretty pro big blocker and screaming about fees like a maniac said he will be one of the first to use lightning on twitter, no idea how much truth to that there is, hopefully hes being truthful.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:23:41
Ya and its not really an apology, he basically blamed it on the other guy, watch his other i interviews, dudes unstable and not sure how people listen to him.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:29:23
Its so damn obvious! When bcash had its 15 minutes of fame, every bitcoin sub was hit HARD with generic comments that wouldnt respond, they were probably all reading from talking points, it was insanse. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:03:10
But I would think more people would actually want to own Bitcoin than just the futures. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:07:49
With the new emerging futures market it will probably make it way less volatile, lucky for him. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:51:10
[Lol.]( 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:06:27
They had there 15 minutes of fame, it's just sad desperation now, when Coinbases releases its supply its not going to be a good time for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:04:24
Learn how to use a wallet or segwit buddy, info is out there, but that would kill your scary regurgitated talking points.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:12:28
I mean Bitcoin will be using lighting soon enough the cheap fee argument won't matter.   If you don't believe lighting will happen their are better altcoins with brighter futures out there anyway, I just don't see any advantage for it long-term.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:15:19
He didn't have a core cheat sheet so he had to improvise for once and his brain got stuck and malfunctioned.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:49:40
? You said private wallet? If you have a private wallet google how to get bitcoin cash.  Just make sure you transfer your bitcoin to a new wallet and use your old private keys to get bch.   Jist read about it and it will be clear. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:25:43
So you tried trading before getting verified? Is that the problem people are having?  They have always been amazing for me but mayne something changed, either that or these are fud posts from other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:54:34


WTF you smokin, it's mostly government building roads, that's why we had a boom with the new deal in the 30's. Caltrans does roads in California and it's not a private company, most states use government agencies.    Looks what happening to telecom, private companies would charge you tolls on simple roads if they could bleed you dry by every little bit.

How is it nonsense, you said it never had problems and I proved it did. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:31:04
Fuck them I'm done, this was stressful, Binance or Gemini works great fuck this shithole, never trusting again, shit hits the fan and they fail. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:32:10
That's amazing, you're a good dude.   To tip someone something that will change their life and not get recognition is the mark of a real humanitarian, not sure how else to put it, but most aren't like you and that's an amazing thing.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:32:29
Thanks Alex Jones!   Is it the lizard people doing it?

Ya mine chases coins that have epic rises and then they fall and he goes mental thinking it's some conspiracy against him when really he's just chasing the dragon. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:48:45
Their latest statement was withdraw only and can you imagine the customer support headaches if they had two with bitcoin in the name lol, especially thats where all the noobs go to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:01:49
No, even your grandma can open a channel and keep it open. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:30:16
That fucker has his grubby little hands all over bitcoin, both sides of the argument, a lot of the companies.  Hes like the koch brothers of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:08:34
I would boycott them because the CEO is a political d-bag, Gemini still hasn't implemented Segwit or batched transactions but they're not all over pushing narratives negative to Bitcoin.   Bitstamp is the real hero that has Segwit and batched transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:34
Every wannabe genius is regurgitating that, Bitcoin never does what its supposed to.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:55:24
Ya but they dont go on twitter and play politics.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:54:38
What lol, if you step out of your echo chamber you would realize Fox has had to retract fake news plenty of times and other times they don't even retract it they keep running with it, much worse in my opinon! Look, if you get your news from any mainstream outlet you're dumber for it, if you get it from Fox you're easily the dumbest of all them. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:37:35
They're only letting you withdraw bch, you can't trade it, so a ton of supply hitting the market will probably actually hurt it and a good time to sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:41:52
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:04:27
Anything is possible, but there is something about the massive infrastructure and history to bitcoin.   No other coin is getting interest like Bitcoin, could that change? Ya but I dont see it anytime soon.  Every coin is having scaling issue's, ETH stalled from the kiddies ICO, IOTA is halting to a stop.   A lot of exciting Bitcoin upgrades coming for adoption so we will see.  I'm pretty diversified so I wouldnt mind other coins taking over I just don't see it at least not for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:21:21
oh, here we go with the tether conspiracies. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:58:11
You sure you're not using IOTA or ETH lol, I kid I kid sort of. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:37:27
Not when cboe and cmi, two of the biggest futures market gets in this month boi!   They run the gov and they want a piece, it ain't going anywhere.   They all think short term and they see the demand and profits for them booming. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:28:40
God I love binance, hopefully you can make it there.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:32:34
Ah yes, the old if I dont want to hear it it's fake routine.   If you look at the poll it didn't even ask politically skewed questions, it asked questions about government or facts about current events that had nothing to do with agenda.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:31:54
Damn, ya i remember seeing it mentioned on blackhatworld website 2010 but didnt pay attention, oh well can't dwell on it were still early.

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:53:16
Yup, you gotta really dig.  That's why my favorites are the most boring right now, Bitcoin (exception not really boring), Factom (boring but record keeping will be huge), Ark (Boring but all in one swapping and blockchain creation), throw in some Walton for RFID chips.    All the hype fans hate this coins but they all have interesting and really potential futures.

Same here, when it first came out, god you could swoop up so much.   It also got me into Bitcoin so I'm grateful to it, great positive community too. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:40:15
They are anarchists, I was in Oakland for the occupy Wallstreet and most were peaceful until a group of kids dressed in black with masks came and fucked shit up.  They're known around the bay area to stir shit up, it's no secret.
@_date: 2017-02-01 02:15:14
Or they just refuse because they have to keep their corporate puppeteers happy and you're getting in the way of that.

@_date: 2017-02-02 23:04:58
Without being in his brain it's hard to speculate why he is but it's obvious he is.  For a person with a lot of power he responds to the smallest criticism.  All the presidents since the 70's have been mocked by SNL and they don't react, his thin skin can't leave it alone.  I remember a Howard Stern interview a long time ago where Stern told him he's too sensitive and he basically agreed saying maybe.  If you're confident and feel like you know what you're doing you don't get worked up by every little criticism.
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:51:03
The way it should be. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:58:01
Ya me neither.
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:48:09
What's funny is he is the most insecure person I have ever seen and his followers call everyone else snowflakes.   We need a level headed president that can think a little without an immediate knee-jerk reaction. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:33:12
There is a science to it and I someone that does well and lives off it but you really have to know what you're doing, so many damn different graphs.
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:30:50
So you think if you just get rid of government, corrupt companies like those that caused the the market crash, pollution and monopolies are just going to suddenly put themselves in check?

@_date: 2017-02-07 07:38:37
I can't stand Trump and his policies, but no way you should have been sprayed, that shit is ridiculous and hopefully they get charged.   
At the same time people can't be that shocked when a self-admitted agent provocateur goes to speak in very liberal areas for some attention and to stir shit up.   That's no excuse for the violence the anarchist need to be locked up but c'mon now, not the smartest move, but it's your right to do it!
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:08:28

You have a unique situation i'm not sure i can help.  Maybe make a post about it and someone can have a good solution.  For my individual transactions on Electrum i always have low fess that get confirmed fast and don't run into this.  Worst case you can always stop for now and comeback when lighting is enabled, sounds like a really good solution to that crom hearing about Litecoins use with it.   Would hate to see a merchant go though, maybe there is something to help you, i will also ask around and see if i can find a solution.

They were with NATO until they wanted to start a war with Georgia and recently Ukraine.  I get the argument that the US is too powerful and wants to control other countries, but the alternative is a breakdown of NATO means less of a unifying voice and countries like Russia starting conflicts with neighboring at will.     
At the same time I agree we (The US) goes to war with smaller countries that I am totally against.  But the breakup with NATO would cause a cluster fuck of more countries going to war with each other.  It's a fucked up situation but I don't see breaking up a unity of countries working out better.    If you disagree, why am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:48:10

I also kept worrying about the "what if's" too much, I get where you're coming from though.   That's why they say don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Step back for a minute, there is hardly any support for BCH in the big picture, most big players don't want to be switching back and forth between coins.   Bitcoin has majority support and I don't see miners leaving it, would be stupid, even the big supporters of BCH aren't putting their money where their mouth is and switching over. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:02:06

There are a lot of companies that pay their employees in BTC, I see them on here all the time.  Some have issues with the transaction fees but that's getting worked out.  I think you maybe missing the scope of BTC but yet also how early we are in this space in the big picture, but it's understandable to be skeptical, have at it.

Trying to figure this out, isn't there 1k's of individuals running core full nodes and way less miners through pools but they have a lot of hash rate? Or did i mess that up, I know the miners have the hash power but if more i individuals run full nodes would that mean the other one forks off? I guess what i'm asking what determines the "real" bitcoin in a hard-fork? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:51:50
Actually, I don't think you can import the wallet, not positive.  But you can place it in it's directory.  JUST MAKE SURE TO MAKE A COPY AND DON"T OVERWRITE IT!!!!  It should be in %appdata%, try that actually it might work with multibit hd just don't overwrite it and make copies of that wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:31:56
I did just that and it feels good.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:30:16
Nah man that's what I thought too, they will regulate it and they want that sweet tax money but they won't ban it, cats out the bag.  [They're even starting to fight for it]( relax.  I also thought nobody cared, but actual countries like Russia and North Korea are setting up mining farms, we're just getting started but keep fighting it maybe eventually you'll come around or maybe not. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:51:57
Theres nowhere near the demand for bitcoin cash, i would think a lot of miners would lose a lot of money, it would be more about principle which i dont see many switching.

Do you have multibit hd or multibit classic? If hd you can import it into Electrum, I would do that and get away from Multibit.

I wouldn't call it staying true to his word, he realized it had no support and would lose a shitload of money pointing to it. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:48:32
Hmmm, I had Multibit HD but they stopped support but it still works.  It's 2013 so that might be for the original multibit not HD.  Sounds like you don't have a seed phrase? If you did you can import that into an Electrum wallet, they did an update for Multibit HD.  But it looks like you have a wallet.  As long as you have the wallet someone here should be able to help, I never dealt with a .json file so can't help you there, good luck! Keep us updated. 
Edit: Maybe try and find a version of an early multibit, before HD?

One of the first rules is never store it online, online market places have been hacked before.   Coin base seems pretty secure but you never know.  Or like the other guy said if they go under or the feds go after them.  Just keep it on your own, there a lot of tutorials how to easily do it.

@_date: 2018-06-16 17:27:36
There is a difference between hearing about something and getting interested or knowing about it and investing, usually it takes people a lot of times hearing about something to get interested in it. A lot of people have heard the name but know nothing about it and think it's some foreign weird thing, we're still so early it's insane, just go talk to the average person about Bitcoin and see how much they know, I have and it's pretty entertaining.

I havent listen to this one, but last time maybe a year ago they had "bitcoin experts" that didnt really know much about bitcoin and got a bunch of answers wrong.  They also kept bringing up the shady stuff Bitcoin was involved with and din't explain its such a small piece of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-05 21:22:06
As Bitcoin gets bigger it becomes less volatile, yes it's still extremely volatile right now to be used as a main currency but as more people get in I see it being less and less volatile.   Also lighting network is in the works and other upgrades that will help really lower the fees, so I don't see that being an issue in the future either. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:08:16
Nah, cuz it wont be listed, you can only withdraw it sounds like so people will move it to exchanges they can dump most likely, thats a big dump of coins on the market, never good for price.

Yup, my buddy had a internet gambling problem and kept losing a shitload of money.  So I got him into Bitcoin and gave him blockfolio to stare at lol.   I told him at least gamble on Bitcoin if he's going to be hooked on something, better odds.

@_date: 2017-11-23 14:46:36
I dont see why you're downvoted it is.   Bitmain has most hashrate, more than for Bitcoin.  It has way less devs, the top 100 richest addresses are way more consolidated, it's a centralized miners wet dream. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:11:17
Coinbase and Xapo supported it, scary enough that these big guys trusted this garbage enough? Here is where the [old list]( is that's not there anymore, anyone have a list that is showing, can't let the community forget who these guy are that could have possibly ruined Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:24:01
Thing is the market doesn't care about a little higher fees, they want Bitcoin.  By the time it can be used by the masses we will have Lighting and other upgrades, it's not as a big deal as the vocal minority make it. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:04:10
That's why I said soon enough we will have lighting and other upgrades.

Nah, Bitcoin is still really early we don't "need" mass adoption at this very moment, we're moving towards it man, Rome wasn't built in a day and Bitcoin is only 8 years old.   Pretty early for mass adoption, slow and steady is better to work all the kinks out than mass adoption right away. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:24:18
That would be a dumb plan cuz he would instantly crash it with that many hitting the market.  The way to do it is cash out slowly but he cant do that because people would know.   He hasnt touched them in 8 years and everyone thinks he disappeared or died I dont think its an issue, he would have touched them by now most likely. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:50:48

Yup, but I wonder how they treat people that got Bitcoin before exchanges or mined it or bought it through paypal without any proof? They probably just want their money and won't mess with you.

Point is the market doesn't really care about paying a little higher fees, they want Bitcoin and the possible return.  I think we need to get the fees down but that's what Segwit and Lighting is doing, my Segwit fees have been low and I have had no problems.   Lighting will be here soon enough, I think the market doesn't care about fees as much as a vocal minority screams it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:18:05

@_date: 2017-11-15 17:40:57
I was attracted by my hate of banks and their fees, manipulation of currency and giving money to useless wars, then I thought about all that Bitcoin can do.   I do want cheaper fees, of course we do and for the most part I have been able to get them.  I learned how to use wallets better, used Segwit and they have been pretty cheap, there are also many upgrades in the works to solve that by the time we reach mass adoption, I just think the fee talk gets old when most the time it's not even an issue but the other side is masters at keeping this talking point insanely important. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:28:39
My friend would buy high during the excitement and then freak out and sell low when it dipped, I kept telling him and him kept doing it like 3 times.   Now he feels sick to his stomach watching it go crazy up and he's not in it, feel bad for him but I kept telling him to just hold if it's money he can afford to lose and he wouldn't.

If it's on a regulated exchange like Gemini or Coinbase it's insured by the government.   If it's at home it's just like holding gold in a safe or somewhere secure.  There are multiple double even triple authentication options to make Bitcoin safe even if someone were to burglarize you.

Yup, was a lot easier to move the market with the low volume then, I doubt we see anything like that again, anything is possible with a black swan event but hard to picture that happening again and it's going to be a lot harder to move the market that much with the volume and demand we're seeing.

Hardware fails but if he has the seed it's a bip encryption, so he can extract the private keys with the seed I believe, correct smarter people than me? Also the seed should work or work on another Trezor? Hardware can fail but if he has the seed he should be good still.   At least on Ledger if you have the seed words and it fails you just input them again or worst case you can figure out the private keys from the seeds.

The 2013 bubble indicator is at 13.5%
The 2013 bubble indicator is calculated by dividing the current 150-day return vs. the maximum 150-day return during the 2013 bubble. 
An indicator of 13.5% means that we have 13.5% of the returns of the 2013 bubble.
 • The current 150-day return is 276%
 • The 2013 bubble had a return of 2,039%.
To reach 2013 bubble levels, the price of bitcoin would need to be $54,761 today.

There is a lot of smart people in the space, no idea what it could be but maybe there is a solution.   Could be something "like" a bank, I know scary word to keep it somewhere else.  But maybe a mutlisignature solution or something where they can just take it out without you or something, yes it's more centralized but at least they're not printing money and have complete control of it, I'm hopeful.  Same could be said about gold though, someone could come in and rob your house or your safety deposit box.

What? Segwit is P2P how is the governmet shutting that down?....Bitcoin cash has like 3 main miners (mostly 1) if they get shutdown it's a wrap, EDA is a joke by the way that causes inflation.   They keep screaming Satoshi's vision but played you so miners get paid more, that's the last thing he would want.   Big blocks will only take you so far, we need innovation and to advance Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:48:39
No idea what that means. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:01:46
Nothing is wrong with paying miners, of course they need to get paid, they will still get paid good without ASICS which is what they're worried about.  You don't think Roger Ver, Jihan and Mcafee aren't trying to call for big blocks? They're the main players behind the push, yes there are also community members that want big blocks but the miners are pushing hard for it that's why they're trying to ram 2x through.  I tried to keep an open mind in the debate but I only see the big blockers calling for big blocks and no real other innovation, they're also worried about new change which is understandable but we don't have to stick word for word to Satoshi vision, things progress and change.     Segwit has worked great for me and I'm looking forward to newer innovations.

I sure as hell trust the community as a whole more than the exchange with users.  That's like wanting to put Bank of America in charge of money because they have clients.

Sounds like Bank of America stocks are more up your alley.

For now nodes are the real voting power over hashrate, why the real btc is surviving through all this.

Lol, i just said BTC1 is my favorite, look at my history bubba.   The way Ver and Mcaffee propped up Bcash I could see these suits coming in propping btc2 up and saying look! There you have it more support. Yes it looks fine now but its still early.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:25:03
Look at my history I'm for core and hate 2x , yes core is winning but we saw what Roger, Jihan and Mcafee did to BCH with fake Korean volume ect.    I'm just saying 1 exchange is a recipe for disaster as a representative of the whole market, no matter what side you're on, it's easier to manipulate.

If everyone is using BTC in the future, who is paying for roads, fire department, education etc? Most people are just greedy by nature, I can't even get my neighbors to help out with our private road, how will things get paid for I never hear their answers to this.  I will be happy if we stop funding useless things like war we don't need ect but we still need certain things to be paid for to help the general public.

I'm not sure you're grasping how early it is in the Bitcoin evolution, volotilaty has went down a lot from its inception.   As more and more people use it the volatility goes down, so in time it will be a non issue.  As far as fast and cheap, there are many advancments in the works, we already have Segwit which is making it cheap.   Lighting is in the works and will be really fast and cheaper than credit card fees for merchants.  It's too early to be used on a mass scale but that's why we're not there yet, soon enough it will just keep plugging along making gains.

A lot of new people and those that feel safer storing it online will be an issue.

It's been a constant pattern of BTC up alts down, then BTC levels out for awhile and people jump back into alts.  I think the fork has a lot of people getting out of alts into only BTC and they will somewhat jump back in after.   We're still so early in this, I have no doubt the crypto scene will explode even more.  I'm sure the shitcoins will burst but the solid coins will come out ahead.  You have complete privacy coins, record keeping coins already working with fortune 500 coins etc, pretty exciting to watch.

First off, a lot of us value not having to keep money with a bank, we don't like that they keep printing money and inflation is out of control.   As far as a currency, its still so early adoption wise.  In just 8 years Microsoft, Overstock, Tesla etc take bitcoin, thats pretty damn amazing for such a young technology.  We're just getting started, Japan will be the real innovator they're already using it a lot for smaller transactions.    If you're a skeptic that's understandable, but for how early it is it's changing the world in a big way and a lot of us see the writing on the wall.

You don't see a difference between somebody with a couple CPU's and a giant asic mining pool, really? He did not envision mining pools and their consolidation threats, core needs to implement a code change to stop the monopoly asap.

When people see the difference between a blockchain bank coin and bitcoin it will be an easy decision for clients.  Upgrades are in the works for cheap fees it will be a non issue by then, you guys really love to push your altcoins nobody wants lol, but keep pushing that scary fee narrative.

@_date: 2017-10-24 16:31:43
Like you said if we could figure out how to get fiat into Bitcoin without using coinbase etc that will fix a lot of this, local bitcoin is a great step but not the solution.  But I'm not sure how we do that.

On an exchange like Gemini, they handle all deposits and withdraws, you can use your bank account, credit card, wire money etc.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:39:48
There is good technical discussion if you can sift through the bullshit, I eventually went with core after sifting through both subs extensively and coming up with my own decision.   You can find the real technical people and the shit starters pretty easy.

There's so much that goes into this loaded statement.  Different cultures had importance on different things.  Some had desire to colonize and expand (mostly Europeans), other cultures put more importance on community and culture, it's just different.  I wouldn't call one smarter than others because they had different priorities.   Just cuz my neighbor goes into finance and makes a shitload of monny doesn't mean I'm a dumb guy because I decide to teach kids and help the youth.  Other cultures have been proven to be happier than the US because they have a close knit culture and value different things, but yes we have skyscrapers and a stock market if that's how you're measuring intellect.

You're theory is when libertarianism and selfishness go wrong.  Sounds great in theory but most people dont want to pay for it until it goes wrong and then its too late.

I keep trying to find an answer and nobody can answer me.  Say wost case scenario multibit hd goes under and i cant access it in the future.  Is there a way to use the wallet word seeds to find my private keys? Because you cant export keys in multibit hd.  I vaguely remember someone saying the wallet words are encryption that you can encrypt and find the private keys but no idea if thats true.

No, you don't need them in your wallet before the split, you just need your private keys which you can export later when you get back.  Unless your planning on trading the day of the split dont worry about it, no need to have the buddy do it.

They are secure, multibit isnt shady they just dont do support, just get home, export the private keys and your good.  You can import them to electrum or others and figure out bow to get your trash spinoff coins thqt probably wont be worth anything but it is nice to have free coins.  Always keep your private keys or for newer ones your seed words.
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:01:51
You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin, you can buy whatever amount you want.  Just buy what you can afford that wont hurt if you lose it.  A lot of us think all this drama is nonsense and once it's over the price will go up, i really dont see any crashes ahead, but do your own research.

I do think its cool, i upvoted his video and give him props.  I just think its weird how much he desires to hit the front page and needs this subs validation.  If he really is mining with that setup thats cool, i just think he doesn't realize hes getting downvoted by the way he comes off not what he's doing.   
By the way, thanks redditor of two weeks with a post history that looks like dans lol.

I have a contract its fine, its not a big road, pretty small but its the principle of it.  Same goes for fortune 500 (who arent used to the state taking care of them) companies, its a race to the bottom.  They have a mentality of pull yourself up by the boostraps but its too far.  Theyre willing to fuck ove the environment and their workers to make an extra bonus.  Unfortunately people are greedy and selfish, just like a few bad apples kill and steal.  We can just let the market run wild it won't work and will run things i to the ground for short term gains.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:34:27

Don't worry man, Electrum saved the day and just did an update where you can import your multibit hd seed and get your coins and private keys.  Long as you have your private keys you're good to go, no need to waste money transfering.   Really excited they did that, i was worried too.

I'm really curious what they are going to do, will they finally be gone or is it a bluff.  Are they going to put all their hashing power to this altcoin? Or will they lose a shitload of money if they do that, so they will stick with Bitcoin, I'm curious. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:02:21

They don't want to win it, bad for business.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:16:46
No, don't worry.  Everyone wants to sell the altcoin and nobobdy wants to buy.   You have the real bitcoin version, if you want to try and hustle to get something for the altcoin nobody is trading then get a wallet and get the keys (which you should do anyway) eventually because you don't want to store your coins on an exchange long-term.  Your safe for now in Coinbase but as everyone says you don't really own your bitcoins until you have the private keys, but don't panic you're good, lot of fear mongers in these parts lately. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:18:26
I'm guessing it's a typo, they basically want you to run it on a machine that hasn't had your bitcoin wallets ever stored. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:40:26
Get that shit off the exchange when you can.

It's not terrible advice, optimal is owning your private keys in a wallet like Electrum ect.   It's beat in our heads that you don't own your Bitcoin unless you own the private keys. Shady exchanges have gone under, like you said I don't think Coinbase will and it is insured, probably the safest of exchanges but the ultimate is to keep your own keys.

I hear that but I think you can have both, you can want to have a nice ROI because as much as people say money doesn't matter, it does.  If you came from a wealthy background it's especially easier to say that, but bills need to be paid and it's nice to at least be comfortable in life. But I also see the amazing potential of the currency to get away from the centralized monopoly that control the world really, so I think you can root for both.

I get that talk, but why not have both.  You can have regulated and underground markets.  If you go full on "fuck that" they might just crack down on all of it and you will only have black markets anyway.   I dont see the argument for all or nothing.

Im trying to figure this out there is no way to export private keys, you only have your wallet words

I think most is just a correction, some concern to a small amount that know the drama but most investors don't.  Remeber we still really up lately, it cant always dramatically go up.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:07:11
I have both evenly and im more worried about eth long-term, i might sell half soon as i think its a bubble and all these ICO's could dump the ETH they raised, also dont really trust ETH's developer but it could get through the issues and do well with that said.   Really im pretty torn on what to do but i feel more comfortable with Bitcoin long-term even with the drama we have.

Luckily transaction worked for me and immediately sold for Bitcoin and Factom.   Got a nice profit so if it does take off some more, it is what is is and i might feel left out but I'm happy I made a profit overall. I just dont see it as long-term and comforting as the trusty Bit.

I'm torn, that is my first thought as well.   But if we want to have some representation in D.C we have to have some of the establishment.    We can say fuck that and then have the feds crack down majorly on Bitcoin or we can find a balance.    There will always be a black market for it but wouldn't you want to easily buy Crypto's with USD? I don't see that happening without playing by some of the rules in the US.

Depends, cash would have been good to hold during this last Bitcoin crash, cuz you could purchase more and your money would be more stable.  I think that will change in the future seeing I have believed in Bitcoin for years but let's be honest with ourselves at the moment.  Cash is also good to hold during a major stock selloff which looks like we might be getting, Bitcoin will get there but cash is still king unfortunately.

No like like a wallet private keys.   Get a wallet like Electrum and learn how to do it, its not hard.  I'm not sure i would leave it on an exchange, probably totally fine but if you want to be extra careful get a wallet and get your private keys, its really not hard.  Just make sure to back it up, ask in the bitcoin beginners sub.

Well it would keep shady morgage companies honest because the blockchain wont lie, same with homeland security ect, you cant falsify records or destroy them, so you get a more honest record keeping.
