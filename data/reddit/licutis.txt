We should not expect opportunities to get rid of Brian to come along regularly.

If we all were able to get some decent 200w+ asic based on the newest chips we could help break the bitmain cartel. It really helps that there are more of us and we don't really need to make a profit mining, I am happy to loose a small amount of money to secure the network. The 1200 watt miners that are designed for farms quickly overwhelm the average home infrastructure, they are the real cause of centralization.

The bitfury chips do 100GH per chip with air cooling at ~6.7w per chip. So 3.3TH out of 220w. Sidehack is working on some 100-220w versions ( With immersion cooling, the bitfury chips will do 1.8gh per. Hopefully we will get them by fall.

It's interesting how many XT and BU nodes are still left. More detailed breakdowns showing old versions of core indicate how bad people are at updating software. Even if everyone was on board with a HF getting 99% of nodes to just update would take a miracle. A subtle way bitcoin is resistant to change, lazy users.

With the overwhelming majority of Ethereum being pre-mined and owned by its creators it's a shit coin with the appearance of a high market cap, but it is not reflective of reality.

 IANAL, but it's probably worth trying. Depending on what state you live in the amount you lost may be under or very close to the small claims threshold ( You will get Verizon's attention at least. They let someone take over your account and it caused you a loss at the end of the day.

you are confusing luck with skill
