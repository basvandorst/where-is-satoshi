The "power going out" is just one example. There's plenty of other ways for bit-coin to fall over without the power supply failing, because it requires a network of interconnected computers (all running the same functionally identical software).
Communications disruptions, intentional sabotage, innocent mistakes in code/implementation, unseen flaws in the design, etc., are all things that can completely disrupt and disable bit-coin, even if just temporarily. None of those things would stop gold's usage as a currency.
As for divisibility, bit-coin's only got eight decimal places of divisibility. That yields two hundred ten trillion satoshis when every coin is mined. Meanwhile, humankind has mined 162,965,704,076 grams of gold, and while [single gram gold bars]( are popular as gifts and keepsakes, they're certainly not the smallest denomination gold can be purchased in. Gold flakes are a thing, after all, and bars can be made with less than a gram of gold in them, too.

72-hour psychiatric hold -- bog standard procedure for people that display signs of unstable mental illness or that pose a possible risk to themselves or others.

With all that sucker money (er, sorry, "VC") flooding braindead startups' coffers, consulting is a sure thing.
As for "massive growth over the past 3-6 months," it's always easy to claim "massive growth" when your previous number was zero. When you consider the fact that there's less than 100,000 bit-coin users worldwide _in total_ (and likely far fewer active ones), "massive growth" is a relative term in this "space."

And how exactly will that work for bit-coin in an environment where the local currency is failing and communications infrastructure is vulnerable and potentially not reliable?
You can exchange pesos for dollars by hand, in person, with no computers involved. How do you expect people in the midst of a financial panic to use bit-coin, which requires computers and reliable telecommunications to conduct transactions?

I'm pointing out the silliness of the argument. "This currency can save you, if you accept its limitations and the bullshit ideologies that come along with it."
There are, as always, _way_ more useful and easily-obtained currencies (including arch-nemesis U.S. dollar) that hold their value and are easily interchangeable at countless exchanges worldwide. There's _no_ reason to expect people to flock to bit-coin for this.
@_date: 2016-03-18 10:23:11


With which exchange? There's only a handful that even support bit-coin at all, and there's no guarantee whatsoever that any of them would be willing to work with a national currency in the midst of a crisis.
You use the word "simply," but that isn't applicable with bit-coin. Cashing out requires days of delays providing adequate identification to use the exchange and more days waiting for withdrawals to actually happen, and that's when things are working smoothly.
That's not even remotely acceptable to someone trying to preserve their money with a foreign currency by converting it into the failing currency on-demand.

@_date: 2016-03-18 10:33:25
Reads like a press release pumping a stock. I remember similarly excited articles arriving by the truckload when Greece began its financial debacle. Bit-coin hasn't made any inroads there either despite the turmoil. Why would it be any different in Latin America?
Noteworthy in this article are the "hard numbers" boasting record growth in exchange activity and of course BitPay's customers. All we get are percentages, not real numbers, and remember that BitPay clients aren't accepting bit-coin, they're using a middleman to avoid ever touching the stuff themselves. There's still only a meager handful of people using bit-coin, and even fewer businesses accepting it for payment. In a crumbling economy, there isn't much capital investment to be found in adopting a new currency and building infrastructure to support it. There's no reason for people worried about paying their electric bill or having a working cell phone to jump through the hoops needed to use bit-coin.
That a few prominent bit-coiners are rubbing elbows with government officials in Latin America doesn't really hold much promise when the worldwide track record for bit-coin has been banned or heavily regulated anywhere a government decides to bother acknowledging it as a currency at all.

Also, you need to learn how and why logical fallacies apply and, more importantly, when they don't. Referring to someone speaking about a subject in a field in which they are widely considered an expert and suggesting that statement has more weight than it normally would _because_ of that expertise is **not** an appeal to authority.
"Bob's an expert car mechanic, so you should listen to his advice about how to perform open heart surgery" is an example of an appeal to authority. Bob is not an expert in surgery, nor is he a medical doctor, so suggesting that because he's an expert in car repair he should be trusted giving surgical advice is unwise.
It's not a fallacy at all to suggest listening to him when he says you shouldn't drive your car on a flat tire.

Debit cards, accepted by the same merchants who accept credit cards, do not have this problem.


Literally _millions of people_ disagree with you.


"In minutes." "Almost no cost." Debit and credit card transactions are instantaneous. If you're going to try to handwave that away with the usual "oh but _settlement_ takes longer!" rhetoric, you're barking up the wrong tree, since merchants expect dollars (or euros or pounds) and converting from bitcoin to their desired currency _and_ transferring it to a bank is neither fast _or_ free (in fact, it's likely to be slower than a bog standard bank-to-PayPal or PayPal-to-bank transfer).


It's also wrong (see above). It's a mindless smokescreen. It's a "solution" desperately in search of a problem.
Be serious here -- you're trying to argue that a prominent bitcoin payment processor transitioning to almost exclusively handling dollars and _downplaying and even hiding its usage of bitcoin_ is somehow a good thing for widespread adoption of bitcoin.

But more seriously, no, technology doesn't automatically "demonetize" things. We don't live in a post-scarcity society just yet, nor have we hit a singularity.
It costs resources to implement ideas. It takes someone's time to do it, and that's time they can't spend doing something else. That's the opportunity cost. It takes tools and materials to build physical things. That's another cost. It takes other tools to build computer software.
Then there's the matter of food and shelter for the people doing the building. You won't last long developing a paradigm-shifting software package wandering like a nomad -- you need food, clothing, shelter, electricity and internet access to work on things.

Clearly you've never been to a yard sale, flea or farmer's market or an overseas cash-only shop. The point is that dollars work in the absence of tills and "card readers" -- those are optional conveniences, not requirements. 
And you do know they make tills that don't require electricity, right?


So why boast that your bit-coin is worth more than it was when you bought it? Lots more people _lost_ on their speculation bets than won. It's not like you (or anyone else) can explain bit-coin's spontaneous $50-ish spike in exchange rate over the past few days. You got lucky -- there was no cleverness in your timing and nothing "intrinsic" about bit-coin that guaranteed its exchange rate would rise. 
When the inevitable price crash comes again, will you still be so boastful? 
As for the rest, how on earth can you possibly claim bit-coin "wins" in areas like "security" (the stuff gets stolen or lost on such a regular basis, you could set your watch by it), "scarcity" (deflationary currencies are utter lunacy for an economy), "divisibility" (you're aware that banks keep track of fractions-of-cents, right? And divisibility is just bit-coin's workaround for its scarcity), "durability" (there are how many hundreds of thousands of permanently lost/irretrievable bit-coins now?) or least of all "utility"?
Dollars have vastly superior utility compared to bit-coin. That you find it "debatable" that it can be spent even amid a power or infrastructure failure is irrelevant. The fact that I can pay my neighbor for his table saw in cash, skipping _all_ middle men entirely, paying no fees, waiting zero seconds for any kind of "confirmation" and leaving him satisfied that he's been instantly paid with no way for me to surreptitiously "double spend" the dollars I just gave him is a big deal. You'd think the bit-coin crowd would appreciate that kind of transaction -- especially the "no middle men" part.

They're still worth something when the power goes out.

Yup. I noticed.


Yup! First thing you said was:


(this would be the "got mine" part)


(cheerfully ignoring absolutely everything going wrong with bit-coin and laughing off any suggestion of its imminent demise just encourages your "pals" to keep on hodling (or throwing more good money after bad), which would be the "screw you" part)

I'm really bummed the Pepperidge Farm bit didn't get more traction.

This is one of bit-coin's greatest weaknesses. "It's never bit-coin's fault!" is the de facto response to any person's complaint that they've lost bit-coins somehow. Blame the users, blame the "infrastructure," blame anything and everything except the needlessly complicated cyrptocurrency itself.
It's not hard to store a hundred dollars safely. At all. I can't lose it by stepping on my wallet (i.e. "breaking" it), getting it wet, or forgetting its password.
Despite the many promises and "how-to guides" about how to safely and securely store bit-coin, there are _constant_ tales of woe from people who followed the guides but still lost their coins. And the community's response is always "well you should have...", usually suggesting spending some (fiat, natch) money on a piece of hardware to store the next batch of easily lost coins.


No it's not. Bit-coin's only got one cake, and it'll never get any bigger. In fact it's getting smaller over time because crumbs of it keep getting lost here and there. Once they've all been mined, you'll have people fighting over the crumbs. And deflation. Lots of deflation. That's bad, btw.


Tulips "had value" at one point as well.

They're also not pitching the dollar by highlighting the crime it can help commit either.

Oh come on, BTC doesn't fluctuate **that** much.


Well, that's one way to say "I don't actually have a lawyer", I guess.


No, really, it isn't. I'm genuinely curious what advice you've followed that you received from there.

Fair enough.
