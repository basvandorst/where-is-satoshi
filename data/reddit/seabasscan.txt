What did Johan do to Litecoin a segwit? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:49:50
Maybe mine something else? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:42:13
It most likely will go even higher. 
Litecoin has had segwit and when it got it, it also went up. 
Exciting times. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:46:56
Nah I don't think it would add up. 
Would need quadrillion's of dollars 
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:21:18
Remember that  article about Bitcoin crossing the chasm? Could Bitcoin be crossing that chasm and going mainstream? If not then we could see a similar pattern following this chart. 
But if it is finally going mainstream we should see it follow Moore's Law
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:57:20
Someone needs to make more advertisement and promotion of Bitcoin. When I heard of Bitcoin it was on my way to work over the radio. NPR. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:57:48
Lmao should've used Litecoin hombre 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:00:55
This is epically huge for both Ltc and Btc
Silver and Gold 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:52:54
Lightning network. Isn't Litecoin going to be implementing lightning network in 2 weeks?
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:52:14
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:23:13
Superbook.ag is another good betting site 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:50:44
So Bitcoin is segwit2x for sure? That's good right? Faster larger?
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:19:53
It's safer off Coinbase. Use breadwallet. Or better security is a ledger nano or trezor. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:28:07
Not late at all. If it surges to $500K and one has two Bitcoins, it would be well worth the investment. But who knows what the future holds. We could all get nuked to the stone age.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:04:18
Hmmm yea that makes sense. As mBTC right? 
But the fees are a little high for micro transactions aren't they? 
I also down voted this post. Because you asked us to

I guess just buy and "Hold On for Dear Life" HODL 
That's what most do. But do as you wish. It's your fiat 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:03:48
O shit 
Well at least Bitcoin has already grown well over 5billion. 
You never know
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:47:16
Makes sense
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:52:37
I also would like some clarification on 
Lightning Network
But perhaps lightning network will be so efficient and fast that by then more transactions will be made. Therefore making up for the lower fees? 
Or maybe certain amounts of currency will pass through the lightning network and other amounts will pass through something else with slightly higher fees?
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:40:26
Fees are still to high
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:53:04
You been Bcash
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:37:54
In the span of four months Litecoin doubled in price after activating Segwit.
Bitcoin has yet to fully activate Segwit, but has already been locked in. 
The blue line is the time when Segwit was locked in.
Purple line shows the growth. 
From what I can understand, Bitcoin has a lot more growth to do. Possibly seeing $6k or more by October.
But, it has been going up nearly $100 every day, who really knows. Just my thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:52:57

The market cap almost doubled. Probably will more then double. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:15:41
Personally I believe Bitcoin will be near $10K or more by 2020. Technology is moving so fast and growing at an exponential rate. Blockchain technology is clearly here to stay. It's revolutionized the means of decentralized money and can only get bigger and better. Bitcoin needs more publicity and promotion. Like radio , internet and word of mouth. 
I've told my entire department about Bitcoin and a few of them have bought Bitcoin. HODL
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:32:51
Never. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:02:31
this is deep, i dont get it.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:32:05
Yea, in cases like yours. Sending small amounts is way cheaper if you use Litecoin. And faster 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:46:25
I really hope altcoins shoot upwards to the moon 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:47:01

Bcash &lt; dog feces  
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:17:57
Find a Bitcoin ATM , just kidding. 
Most new comers choose Coinbase. 
You will create an account with some personal info. 
And card numbers and bank accounts if you wish. 
Or if you would like to remain 100% anonymous
Find a Bitcoin ATM. And buy some. 
Then transfer that amount via QR code into a wallet such as breadwallet. Breadwallet needs no personal info. 
But the ATM has like a 20% fee 
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:50:25
Bcash , why would they ever create it in the first place. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is king cryptocurrency. 
Bcash seems like a money grab shit altcoin. Just confuses people. 
Let it die. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:49:37
Life is a risky game. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:55:54
Sweet can't wait to see Litecoin and Bitcoin use Lightning network that sets up for atomic swaps!
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:30:48
Forks are a tool for eating 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:42:16
So Bitcoin is full proof?
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:52:21
I heard of those issues too. 
Also the difficulty to mine new blocks will get a lot harder. 
I guess if it gets to that point people would just be using something else? Litecoin? I dunno. 
But I think that's still a long ways away. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:49:31
I made a Bitcoin shirt for my baby. To commemorate this point in history. I hope someday I can give him the keys to my wallet.

@_date: 2017-08-02 16:09:19
Unspeakable coin is down from $11B to $8B market cap. Bitcoin is king cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:53:08
Safe to assume 2017? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:33:30
Litecoin is fast. So is DogeCoin. Bitcoin is just congested. Idk if this whole segwit and Bip91 will help much at all. Am I wrong? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:18:08
Probably a money grab. People don't want to 
"miss out" there is always that "chance" "risk"

Thank you for the enlightenment. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:21:24
So it must mean Bitcoin takes over the world. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:11:17
I heard there was a company, possibly intel, that has developed 5nm , to get basically double the number of transistors onto that chip
Edit* 
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:18:05
So even if your rough comparison would be true in respect to where we are now. That would mean we still have at least $3k - $7k higher to rise? And even after that would it deflate back down to about $4k? 
I read that Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to follow Moore's Law.
If this is true, then I expect Bitcoin to continue to rise in the coming years. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:05:34

I heard there are events where people get together and trade Bitcoins for fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:51:53
In my opinion , You're better off just using Litecoin. It's the Silver to Bitcoin being Gold. 
While Unspeakable coin is just a shit altcoin ripoff 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:35:56
Whoa! That's so cool, what sort of services do they have there?!
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:03:45
Litecoin has been dormant for a little while now. 
Less volatile? I heard it's getting lightning network in 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:03:06
My guess is it would increase
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:01:56
I have been enlightened. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:27:36
Yup that's the down side to ATM ..

Sorry for your loss ...
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:37:13
That sounds awesome, Litecoin will also be enabling lightning network which will make it much faster near instant transactions with low fees. 
Bitcoin is Gold and you must Hodl
Litecoin is steady to spend a pretty penny

@_date: 2017-09-28 03:41:08
Hmm you sure? I don't see it as an available update. 
Edit: never mind I see now. !!!! Wow 
I have the old version. 
But when I got the App Store and search breadwallet. 
It is there. But it is the new update version. And it says Open instead of Install. 
Crazy. 
I won't be updating until I know this bug is dealt with. 
Good luck man.

Bitcoin has a long way to go. 
That is just one satellite. Would need hundreds if not thousands more. 
The satellite would also need a radio tower. To broadcast the signal and amplify. 
These disasters are a major problem. 
Isn't there a way to make/use Bitcoin offline? 
Something like a memory bank of transactions. 
And then when power / connection goes back online. Then those transactions in the memory can flow through and get confirmed.

Declaring me a bum? Let's define Bum. 
Bum - a person who devotes a great deal of time to a specified activity.
This would imply I am quite the enthusiast of cryptocurrency. 
I am "begging" for a couple ETH after all. 
Let's also define the action of "begging" 
Begging - ask for something, typically food or money, as charity or a gift.
I have every right to ask for a couple ETH.

So now you would be having an additional 2%? 
12% fee.  Not very appealing. 
If I used this card to buy something but never received it. Would this Visa card have the ability to refund me? And instead of using this Visa card at shops, why don't the shops just adopt Bitcoin? Visa just wants in on the fees, doesn't want to miss the opportunity to make profit off convenience. 
The shops should just accept Bitcoin , peer to peer. 
No middle man necessary.

Oh well.

@_date: 2017-07-24 13:58:12
But a 2% fee ? Kind of defeats the purpose of Bitcoin doesn't it? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:06:23
So BIP91 is done, and now we are waiting for segwit, right? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:42:49
2% fee... £2,000 limit.... rip off. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:00:21
That says "4 hours prior to the BIP 91 activation block" hasn't it already been activated?

@_date: 2017-07-12 03:55:39
I can see your point here. It is possible. Even looking at all the other cryptocurrencies graph on coinmarketcap. You can see that a lot of them have a trend of spiking at the same times of the year and then falling to what they were worth before the spike. I think you might be on to something. But who knows, 
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:09:56
So, likely my deposit won't go in until 16 days from now?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:04:58
This is a good thing right? Means Bitcoin is moving forward with BIP91.  And, no split?

@_date: 2017-07-31 01:43:40
If this fools theory does go down, what about Litecoin? Litecoin from what I heard is already segwit, and something about lightning network features. Litecoin could rival bitcoin in all this chaos of confusion.
