I read it, and didn't see any.  I'm asking you which ones specifically.
Or perhaps you don't know and are hoping to run away from this conversation?

So Marxism for software.  OP is a retard.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:12:26
Alright, I'll bite.  What specific principles has he laid out that are in use in modern application?  
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:12:03
Theoretically yes, but rather curiously there are many self-styled right-wing libertarians on reddit who feel exactly the same.  Hard to wrap one's head around it.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:13:15
As someone who's something akin to a right-wing libertarian, I kind of agree with his point.  Moving away from the "fuck the banks, dude weed lmao" subset of users would help bitcoin adoption considerably.

What rights do software users have?  What rights do software users not have that they should?  It's really not clear.

It's the same logic that causes 90% of lottery winners to be poor again within a few years.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:45:31
I'm prepared for downvotes, but this is exactly why giving poor people a lot of money is a bad idea.  They still spend it like poor people.
The generosity is admirable but this is such a poor person way to behave. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:03:53
That's a really bizarre rebuttal.

You can still have a well-defined mission statement.  "The eradication of Malaria through clean water" for example.
This mission statement is pseudo-babble.

You're not alone man.  I'm Canadian too but I'm sick of this unwarranted condescension by other Canadians.  Canada is a mediocre country.  I have no idea where this arrogant attitude of being condescending towards more successful countries comes from.
It's way too common.

Again, which ones are those?  There have been economists before Marx, I'm sure you're aware.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:07:01
You think that was established by Marx, and not anyone before him?  
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:19:07
All your link provides is Marx's surplus labor theory of value, which isn't at all integral to modern economic thought.  What part am I missing here?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:30:30
There are infinitely better ways to manage that money, even if he wants to throw it all away at charity.  Look at how Bill and Melinda Gates are managing theirs.  
Even if he wanted to throw it all at charity at once, there are infinitely more useful things than the nonsense he's throwing money at.  It's his money, sure, but it just paints a picture of a naive kid who has no idea how the world operates. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:46:53
The terms "computer user freedom" and "rights of software users" are both rather nebulous terms.  It sounds like naive libertarian-ish babble.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:32:01
Of all the suffering in the world today, a lack of free software falls somewhere pretty low on the list.

That's actually not true.  Many first-world countries have fairly low taxes.  Hong Kong and Singapore come to mind.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:23:03
What if that organization came up with a tagline that presented that information clearly, without using nebulous language?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:48:29
\ is the surplus labour theory.  This isn't at all part of any economic thought.
\ is a concept that far, far predates Marx.  It's been a concern in a number of empires that predate even the US.
\ is not accepted anywhere, because Marx literally argues that increase productivity from technological advance results in *lower* profits.  Yes, really.  
Marx wasn't an economist.  There's a reason why Marxism isn't valid today.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:57:59
If that were true, there would be very little TA.  With something like equities markets, you get very quick feedback about your actions.  If it didn't work, people would lose money.  Or make less than the guy who was just value investing.
This does not happen.  Your worldview does not line up with facts.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:47:13
Every anti-TA person is a person who simply does not understand TA.
People with poor understanding of systems think systems are random.  Applies in every industry.

That guy is a neckbeard...because he knows how to make money trading?
You're the best example of why poor people are poor.

"All the studies"
The only thing that matters is people making money. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:03:27


Yes, we do.  There are lots of people who make money doing TA.  Consistently, above simple chance.  There are many who also lose money -- it's possible to do TA wrong.  
Put it simply: if TA was resulting in financial losses, *people would stop*.  These are some of the smartest people doing this.  They wouldn't continue if it was objectively an inferior money making measure.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:04:27

Humans, as a collective, are rather predictable.  It's not about analyzing what a single person might do; it's about analyzing what the majority will likely do.  And there are only so many patterns, such that with analysis you can identify common ones.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:59:15


Most market action has little to do with major events.  Those are just the notable actions.  TA is merely plotting human emotion.  Which has reproducibility when analyzed on a large group scale.

Changpeng Zhao grew up and went to school in Canada.  To say his company is "mainland Chinese" is a bit of a stretch.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:44:48


That's literally what they do.  Their success rate is higher than leaving it to chance.  You act like it's impossible to make money using TA.  
TA isn't about being right 100% of the time, it's about being right more often than the other guy.

I haven't posted to this sub more than a handful of times, the last one being months ago.  You must be butthurt about some comment I made elsewhere?
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:03:02
That's just the superficial relationship.  HK is independent in all forms except "official", to allow the Chinese government to say they are a territory of China.  In all ways they act as an independent country, and have a different culture to the mainland Chinese.  So much so that HK'ers often see the Chinese with contempt and being uncivilized.
The stuff you hear about the Chinese being unscrupulous cheaters that do anything to get ahead mainly apply to mainland China.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:48:42
If that were true, there would be no one doing it.  That's an incredibly asinine claim you're making.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:34:54


Buying lotto tickets is stupid and irrational. 
Repeatedly using TA when it demonstrably doesn't work is flat out insane.  No one would do this more than once.  If people lost money, they would stop.  Even highly irrational people do exactly that.
These are incredibly intelligent, logical people, mind you.  Not your average Joes.  I know many.  Incredibly smart people.  If TA didn't work, they'd abandon it for something that did.

They have some clout with HK the same way they do with some of their neighoring countries.  They are an enormous market and China's single-party regime can make changes at the drop of a hat.  They threaten HK all the time to comply with various things or risk economic isolation.  Most HK politicians at least pay lip service to China for that reason, including any kind of pro-independence talk which China clamps down on hard.
China does the same thing with Taiwan, as an aside.  
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:32:09
You're not wrong to have that sentiment, but Binance is HK-based, not Chinese.

There are always ways to stop it.  If China wanted to it could crack down on every exchange that traded bitcoin.  It would drive its usage underground, giving rise to whatever ChinaCoin they came out with.  
People have this idea that it's completely unstoppable but that's simply not true.  If anything, Monero has more rights to that.

@_date: 2017-08-04 18:05:31
Sure, but Bitcoin is currently a long ways off from being the One Global Currency.
The day that starts looking like a reality is the day China puts in measures to protect their own interests.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:06:57
I understand the feeling, but math has no use for those feelings.  Whatever money you put in will grow at the same percentage that Bitcoin overall grows.  And despite its large ticket price, it's growing fast relative to coins much, much tinier.  
I know you know that, it's just annoying that there are so many people who think this way.  
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:32:43
This is delusional.  The odds of Bitcoin being the only currency is slim to none.  China alone won't want in on that.

Good god, retarded posts like this one are hurting adoption.  When people see how uninformed users in the crypto space are it makes people run the other way.
There was no "lost" $9 trillion.  It's literally not possible.  They have audit records.  What OP is likely talking about is the emergency loans made by the Fed, which were in fact $9 trillion.  All of those loans were collateral-backed and were paid back with interest.

The idea is to limit government to that role, typically.  Government is small, but not non-existent.  Its primary purpose is having a monopoly on violence to ensure the continued Libertarian state.  Things like enforcing property laws and maintaining a standing army, police force, etc.

I wish there was someone like you in every reddit thread to shut these snarky idiots up.
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:09:39
Sure you can, you just need to decentralize the power and an immutable document enshrining certain rights.  The US is largely successful in that regard.  A community that self-enforces property rights, with no one person being able to revoke it, will see the continued existence of property rights.

@_date: 2018-11-16 15:10:57
Well of course.  I'm no advocate for pure Libertarianism.  It's an idealistic fantasy.  
You need certain provisions to prevent the most absolute edge cases (such as monopolies).  But you can still have a 90%-ish Libertarian state that would operate optimally.

This generation isn't investing in gold because they are the instant-gratification generation.  Gold is a stable-ish investment meant to hedge against instability, and it does that well.  The inflation-adjusted price of gold today is the same as it was 40 years ago.  The price of gold 18 years ago is the same price it was 88 years ago.
