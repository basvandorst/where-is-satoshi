I think we need to backup and view this as a series of possibilities, to wit, at what level?! City, county, state, country? I'm not a pol-sci type person so I'm going to just spit it out.
Say we kept county/parrish and town governments and the country and state govs were to vanish? These smaller governments would still benefit by establishing and maintaining a mutual currency and a few standards like that. 
There are other possibilities, such as just keeping city, or county, possibly involving a state government. Although I think keeping the state governments is not sufficiently decentralized. Possibly having the town and county/parrish governments loosely grouped as a non-authoritative federation, or alliance, or something like that. As humans we would still benefit from working together in groups to a degree.
Edit: After reading a lot of comments here, it occurs to me that a direct democracy with many districts and no central authority (president/PM or parliament/congress) would qualify as a decentralized government, depending upon the degree of decentralization you are looking for.

So we are taught to laugh at anything called a cure for cancer, but ... 
Well here it is *since the early 1900's more than 100 natural cures for cancer have been found.*
One of the simplest:
ESSIAC, you can buy it for around $20 a pound .. that is enough to make a couple months of the 'tea'. Depending upon the severity and type it may take up to a year to be sure it is completely gone. Some have found that over a period of a half a year or so skin tags shrink and vanish. Others have found that if you take the tea for a few months the tumors will shrink, but if you stop before all traces are gone then it usually comes back very very fast and kills .. a lot like not finishing ones antibiotics, but worse.
Another, Red Reishi, is recognized by the Japanese government as a treatment for cancer. Many mushrooms have strong anti-cancer and anti viral properties. [(see Paul Stamets' book "Mycelium Running").](
I have a very skeptical co-worker, and I drop small hints every now and again because otherwise he gets grumpy and thinks I'm a nut job. He is becoming more curious on his own now and he's learning what I have come to realize over the years .. *we are systematically lied to about everything*.
I haven't even brought up the cancer stuff yet.
Edit: For the downvoters, you can read the whole story [here]( Basically Rene Caisse ran a clinic as a charity, supervised and backed by 8 reputable doctors, for many years before the Canadian government got tired of due process and legality and just shut her down. Rene was only allowed to treat patients that the medical industry could not cure. She was harassed by the medical industry and the police the entire time. She made no money from this and in fact spent her own money curing people with Essiac tea. Anyone who thinks there is a ritual involved is full of shit.

If instead of taxes, goods are sold, frequently at huge markups. Now take this to its logical conclusion, you may notice that you'd be describing corporations of the world. 
The problem is that they are not described or thought of as 'government', even though they have become the oligarchy ruling the US and are working on the rest of the world. More people need to know what they are supporting and vote with their money.

Yes, that would be a sane choice. 
But from what I've seen on reddit and a cursory Google search Mark Karpeles is obsessed with php. Rumor has it that most if not all of gox is running on it.
Sorry rumor is all I can offer as I don't have (or want) that level of access to gox.

You drink the tea once a day, twice if you have been 'treated', financially raped, and left for dead by the current US 'medical industry'.
She *cured* hundreds if not thousands of people from that state for FREE, many couldn't even walk when they came to her. She did not charge them a dime, that makes for a pretty dumb 'scam' if you ask me. She documented everything.
She originally got the recipe from a lady who used it to cure herself of breast cancer, and lived another 30+ years. The woman who had breast cancer and could not afford surgery, got the recipe from the native Americans.

So how are their reputations? Where are they based?
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:55:00
Even if they have no problems delivering .. and they're honest. The big question is will the delivered ASICs even be worth the sand they're made from?
There is talk of changing many scrypt based alt coins to use Scrypt-Nfactor (x11?), not scrypt-jane which is what the ASICs would be designed for. The goal being to make the mining ASIC resistant (damn near impossible), thus avoiding the looming threats of 51% attacks and centralization.
Personally I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:27:50
There is also the distinct possibility of them teaming up with another pool to almost instantly achieve &gt;51%. 
And if they've got hashing power pointed elsewhere to hide it and suddenly pull that back in, the situation gets pretty serious really quick.

It worked for many hundreds of people that the medical industry gave up on .. after bankrupting them. Also Rene treated these people for free, she was overseen by 8 reputable doctors  during the time she ran her clinic.

I *think* he's trying to say that if you hold bitcoin and there is rapid inflation, the exchange rate  of BTC/USD will reflect that. This would allow you to have some stability by converting your paycheck to BTC as fast as you can and then later using BTC or BTC&gt;USD to pay bills. In a situation where BTC is a lot more stable people will adopt it at blinding speed, then you WILL be able to buy everything with it.
