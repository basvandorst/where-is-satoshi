Hey Adam, thanks for putting out such awesome content.  Not really a time sensitive issue, but I would like to hear more discussion around voting on blockchain / open source democracy.  It seems simple and revolutionary at first glance, but there are tricky issues around transparency vs secret ballots, corruption via intimidation or vote buying, identity, etc.

Ask not what Bitcoin can do for you...

Jimmy Song teaches programming blockchain and is a very public advocate of Bitcoin. Check out his work, not so sketchy. To paraphrase Elizabeth Stark the Bitcoin community would benefit from scaling Jimmy.

According to the first noble truth of the Buddha, life as a human is dukkha, often translated as suffering or imbalance.  The insight that has affected my life most profoundly is realizing that rather than being a "bad" thing, this is our greatest teacher.  If one is willing to observe introspectively, it becomes clear that our suffering is our greatest teacher as it points out our attachments, desires, and fears with perfect clarity.  In the process of letting go of these attachments, embracing that the only constant in the material plane is change, the deceptive illusion of separateness occasionally parts to give us humble humans a small glimpse that everything is love.  We don't need to do anything, simply radiate love by being here, now, breathing.  Namaste :)
PS: any donations will go towards building a natural farming educational center, yoga retreat and float tank center in paradise.

Aloha r/Bitcoin, I just registered my first Bitcoin wallet today &amp; am trying to figure out how to take the next steps of making sales &amp; accepting donations in Bitcoin.  Any advice on secure storage would be appreciated.  Also I am trying to figure out how to leverage cryptocurrencies to finance not just my little farm in Hawaii, but a global renaissance in sustainable agriculture and community building?  From my experiences with the peace movement in the buildup to the second US invasion of Iraq, and the more recent Occupy movement, it seems clear to me that the fiat currency system is one of the primary impediments to structuring society for the benefit of humans and the ecology that supports our species.  Any suggestions on how a non computer programming farmer with a passion for increasing human and ecological well being could leverage cryptocurrencies to effect positive change would be greatly appreciated.  
Aloha Mai Kako

Wow, thank you whoever made this page! Also mahalo nui (great thanks) to everyone who has donated to the cause of supporting sustainable agriculture in Hawaii &amp; globally.

Oh wow! It works!! Mahalo Nui!!! 
Please do come visit the farm &amp; join us for community yoga in Honomu, I teach Saturday mornings :)

Hi so we recently started listing our vacation rentals on the Big Island of Hawaii on sites like Airbnb &amp; VRBO.  Also I have spent the last several months educating myself about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in general.  So I got to thinking about disintermediation, and how to use crypto and decentralization to improve vacation rentals.  The most obvious first move is to offer our cabins at a 10% discount to those paying with Bitcoin, but I would like to know if there are any promising looking projects working in this space?  The closest thing I could find is BitTravel, but there is almost no information available that I could find.  Any links or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Also if you are going to be on the Big Island &amp; want to stay on an awesome sustainable farm while getting a discount for paying with Bitcoin let us know.
Aloha Mai Kako

Thats not FUD, such an announcement might be hyper bullish...
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:33:05
Yes, the desire to be free of desire is also a form of attachment or craving which creates the preconditions for the cycle of rebirth :)

PlanB is very active on Twitter &amp; responsive to developing the S/F model: [
The GitHub looks underutilized, but seems like the place for coordinating this kind of work: [github.com/100trillionUSD](
I look forward to reading your paper &amp; agree that this might be very very very important!
@_date: 2019-11-08 00:31:28
Thank you! Would you please consider adding a cleaner version of these two models overlayed as live updating graphs on the website?  I was wondering how they line up looking out the the next two halvings and slapped them together to check &amp; it looks pretty tight.  It would be super cool to have a live chart where one could toggle between Trololo, PlanB &amp; both.  Thanks for your site, I check it all the time for the big picture perspective!
@_date: 2019-11-06 17:46:01
Credit to the creators of these models &amp; graphs.  I just overlayed them &amp; made a low quality GIF.

Ok, how do you do that and stay compliant with regulations?  Is this service available in the USA?
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:50:06
Probably Yap stones, not Hawaiian.  In the Pacific Ocean, so kinda close.  It only covers half of planet earth. 
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:37:37
Maybe consider posting your analysis on PlanB's GitHub: [ 
It would be interesting to get feedback from some of the Quant wizards to further refine the model.
@_date: 2019-10-27 14:51:35
cool thanks, looks interesting enough for a closer analysis.   What did you use for the source of data for M total market cap?  ~~Also PlanB just responded to your graph here:~~ [~~

@_date: 2019-10-27 14:15:19
is there a link to the paper with more details?  Looks very interesting.

This can provide interesting data on how hostile forks without replay protection play out.  Similar to the silver lining the B2X situation would have had but even better as it is forking BCH... Fork all the forking forks ;)

Come on where is the love to support fellow bitcoiners? I am now trying out Bitsquare, and the UI sure leaves much to be desired.  Any suggestions out there?
@_date: 2017-04-24 21:19:31
BitSquare is amazing and could use some BTC sellers right now ;)

Good points, the adoption curve ensures that the majority will be newbs until mass adoption.  The growth in sheer numbers is probably primarily responsible for the drop in quality of content.  I was referencing the timing more so than assigning causality.  That being said I do recall things getting rather toxic during the scaling debate and from my perspective the quality never returned to what it was before then.  
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:56:33
reddit is not particularly antifragile.  Bitcoin on the other hand... moneybadger don't care ;)

Aloha Mahi'ai Paradise Farmstay Cabins near Hilo Hawaii -
We offer a 10% Bitcoin Discount, but no one has used it yet.  If you are going to visit the Big Island of Hawaii, come say with us!
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:00:45
Beautiful, how about with a Saturn 5 instead of the Shuttle for an actual Moon Rocket...
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:53:09
crypto Twitter.  This was the best place before the great scaling debate, but suffered from the tragedy of the commons when the community fractured.  Arguably it started with the introduction of shitcoins, but Btrash was the nail in the coffin. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:33:02
Yes, Big Island.

Coinbase is not currently an option for Hawaii residents.
Use Bitsquare or Local Bitcoins to make the politicians irrelevant.  
If you don't mind the AML / KYC requirements Kraken is still an option for Hawaiians with Tier 3 verification.

How much would you like &amp; what price do you have in mind?  I live on a farm in Hawaii, and have friends that grow cacao.

I liked the perhaps unintended pun with the double meaning and lose definition.  I'm interested in the communities thoughts on weather in historical retrospect the disruption to governmental power structures might equal or perhaps even surpass the economic disruption from Bitcoin and blockchain technology.  Also I am wondering who is building the literal Killer App for the nation state?  I imagine many bitcoiners would be interested in supporting such a project.
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:04:07
Bitsquare. 
Kraken also works if you don't mind all the AML / KYC personal info requirements for Tier 3 verification.
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:50:42
