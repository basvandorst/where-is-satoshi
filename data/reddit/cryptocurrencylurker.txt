Why should there even be a blocksize limit? Fees would be able to replace the limit.  
Like a wise man once said:

etc.

Useless to do what? Follow protocol? Get fees?  
For example, if it's possible to make miners just use transactions that has been propagated through the network, how would a miner get someones transaction into a block without there being a risk that others will mine a block with that transaction beforehand?  
Only attack vector i see is if you have the majority of miners in collusion and decide to spam bigger blocks to try and force out the smaller miners, you would have to invest a lot of capital that you might lose to the smaller miners in the process. But that would assume miners are malicious and the trust model of bitcoin would be broken.

If it's in the protocol and a miner is trying to go around it, isn't that being malicious? Not abiding by the same rules as the majority.  
Just because it cannot be stopped today, doesn't mean someone won't figure out how to stop it tomorrow.

Sure, if miners are malicious they could circumvent the rules by paying back fees in fiat or an other cryptocurrency but that isn't really a good incentive since they wouldn't gain anything from it, just lose money.
