Yeah, but now BTC is controlled by a few large miners, and they want to make money now and don't care too much about the future. Sucks, and I hope BTC will be able to break free from it.

Same as it was with Ethereum, once the network is large enough, that "coordinator" isn't required anymore.


Yes, of course. My take is simply that the chances of a crypto experiment to succeed are larger when you have a bunch of large tech companies placing their investments and knowledge into that coin.
Also, I like the underlying philosophy of being almost infinitely scalable, very fast and free transactions, and not having "miners" that waste tons of electricity to crunch numbers for no reason. 
You seem to be mainly focused on just one implementation mistake in the initial version. I am a programmer myself and shit happens, recognising that is kinda the difference between tech and non-tech people, in my experience. 
Anyway, there are actually a few more points about IOTA that could be criticised and that may turn out to be a show-stopper further down the road. I found the second part of [this article pretty insightful]( [in German] to that regard.

What's insecure? The protocol seems to be secure enough that experts at some [large tech companies]( gave their okay for the companies to invest money. But maybe you have analysed it and know more about tangles that all those people. Would be interesting to hear what you think makes it insecure?
I am no expert either, but seeing those names going with IOTA seemed reassuring.

Sorry, but that's not very believable. At least not from my experiences in the past few weeks.

IOTA. No mining, no fees, and a number of large companies have already "signed up". [Two days ago, Bosch announced]( they had bought a "substantial amount" of IOTAs to use it for automated payments within their IOT products.
Here's the [Wiki]( entry.
Its currently my favourite coin from a tech perspective.
