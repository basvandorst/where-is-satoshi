I only listened to maybe 15-20 minutes, because I was tired of hearing Roger repeat himself.
When Roger spoke about bitcoin losing market share he is attributing that loss of market dominance to bitcoin being slow and unreliable and people searching for better alternatives.  That is a load of bullshit.  Of all the transactions in the crypto space, how many of those transactions are used for actual commerce?  Roger talks in a way as if he thinks there is this bustling consumer spending with cryptocurrency...where the fuck is that?  He's spewing bullshit.
I'd venture a lot of the people in the space, like myself, gravitate to alt coins to make money.  More and more projects/coins are available.  I want to make money, and I'm not going to put all my eggs in the bitcoin basket.  As the crypto space continues to expand, market share is going to continue to contract/grow for each coin depending on the success of these projects and the markets demand for them.
He kept bringing that point up and it was super frustrating to listen to.  Most people see the bitcoin price where it is and think they can make money.  How many of those people are wanting to go buy fucking coffee with crypto?  Give me a damn break.  Once in the space people will discover there is a lot more than just bitcoin and money will flood into other areas, like it does everyday. That's a far simpler explanation for bitcoin loss of market share than the nonsense he keeps talking about.

It's the weekend.  Your bank won't reference the transaction until Monday or Tuesday.

Never lend to friends or family with the intent of being paid back.  Money given to those groups should pretty much be considered a gift or you run the risk of ruining the relationship.

You just had an awful experience with the platform it seems.  What grade loans were you choosing?  We're you chasing yield and investing in garbage?  If I'm chasing yield on P2P sites I would need more capital than $500 because of the default risk.  ~20 loans isn't enough because of the default risk - at that level one or two defaults can ruin you; diversification is needed to combat these risks.  You probably need north of 100 notes; I think Lending Club recommends a minimum of 200.
My experience with Lending Club:
* Been on the platform since August 2015.  Like you I wanted to try it out using some play money.
* 122 all-time notes
* 108 notes are current
* 11 notes paid back in full
* 1 note currently 31-120 days late
* 2 notes charged off (recognized loss on tax return, so that's a plus since it offsets some of the interest I earned)
* Average weighted interest in portfolio: 11.4% -- big chunk is grade B or C 
* Annualized return: 8.5%
I don't use Lending Club's automated investor nor do I use any other Robo-investing platform - I manually select all my loans.  I did sign up for an account at LendingRobot.com, but only to look at their live loan rankings - these have influenced a number of my picks recently, in part, because they provide data on how quickly loans get funded.  If a loan is 75% funded after 5 minutes I take that as a sign it's of higher quality.  Lending Club makes new loans available four times a day (8, 12, 4, 8...all EST I believe...I'd have to double-check the timezone though --- point being: those are the times I go to look at the new loan inventory for "first dibs").  With the amount of robo investing people do through use of Lending Club's API, if a loan passes their criteria and is funded quickly I piggyback and ride the wave so to speak.
If I'm not using information from Lendingrobot.com, here is my main criteria when doing due diligence:
* Salaries must be higher than $70K
* Monthly payment cannot exceed 15% of monthly gross income
* Income is verified (I have dabbled
 with source verified but it's more risky)
* Debt-to Income ratio less than 25%
* Inquiries last 6 months - zero
* FICO higher than 690
* No derogatory or public records in last five years
* Employment of at least 4 years
* No joint applications
* Tend to stay away from AZ, CA, NV, FL, NY, NJ applicants...based on information I read in the past regarding loan defaults by state.  This does narrow the borrowers a lot though.
* Homeowners above renters
* I will discriminate applicants based on where they live and what they do for a living.  For example - if I were to loan to a CA resident they better make $XX because of the COL in that state.  Certain professions also rank higher in my mind then others.  Undesirable applicants can usually be weeded out with other criteria I use though (income).
Pros of Lending Club:
* Gives access to different asset class more unaccredited investors don't usually have access to.
* Returns can eclipse yields from checking/savings/money market/US treasuries.
* Website is user-friendly.
* Has API functionality for more tech-savvy investors.
* The data they provide is very good.  Providing the data allows people to make reasonably informed decisions.
Cons of Lending Club:
* Not really exclusive to Lending Club, but with any investment their are risks.  This is why Lending Club is intended for accredited investors or investors who pass financial suitability tests.
* Funds are illiquid.  Your money is typically locked up for 36-60 months.  Sure, people pay back loans early and you do have the option of selling notes on a secondary market,  but I don't believe the majority of users experience either often, or ever.
* As someone who doesn't robo-invest it can take a very long time to distribute all of your funds especially if you're a picky person.  I put $2K on the platform and it took me months to fully invest it because I won't pick just any loan.

Hmmm, makes sense since due to the volatility of the assets - like a financial suitability clause.  Such rules are even in place for p2p lending (lending club).  You either need to be an accredited investor, or make enough money to invest.  Just rules to protect the average joe from themself; or to exclude the average joe entirely...however you want to look at it.

Use bitcoin?
Buy bitcoin using localbitcoins, transfer to relative in Mexico and instruct them to sell on their end.  Not as user friendly as a typical transfer through Western Union, but gets the job done.  GL to any government entity shutting bitcoin down.

GDAX pays the transaction fee that's why it's free to send from there.
Sending to your breadwallet is fine.  As someone else said, if you choose to accumulate more you may want to buy a hardware wallet to up your security.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:10:07
The fee is based on byte size of the transaction.  Sending $10 could be the same size transaction as sending $10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:40:56
Dude, sitting around during this bullshit is going to be hard.  What sucks more is the 150,000 unconfirmed transactions....I am so tempted to move my coins from my hardware wallet and take what profit I have left if I could get the transaction processed...probably have to pay like $50 just to do that.  FUCK
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:34:25
That was hilarious.

It is pretty easy.  Do you own one?

He's referring to actual purchase of the vehicle, not machine-to-machine transactions.

In the meantime, I sit here like a fool knowing I dumped my BCH at freaking $300 and now with the Korean pump it's up to $1200.  God damnit.

WTF...all that shit is happening.

Was there a signup bonus too?  lol
Doesn't look like it.  That would have been even better.

CPA here, but not a tax expert. Based on my reading of the topic here is how I think one should handle this:
* You technically received income on August 1, 2017 the day of the fork.  The amount of this income should be able to be derived from somewhere.  I went to coinmarketcap.com and found the opening price on August 1 to be $294.60.  This amount would hold true for anyone that qualified for BCH at the time of the fork, whether it was redeemed or not.  If there is a different price available I would like to know, otherwise I myself will just use this when I do my taxes.
* number  of BCH multiplied by opening day spot price is your amount of Other Income due to the event that should be reported on your taxes at minimum (if you're still holding 100% of your BCH at year end).
* $294.60/BCH would become your basis as well.
* Like a lot of people, if you offloaded your BCH before holding for 1 year you have short-term capital gains which are taxed at ordinary rates anyway.
* Recap example:  received 1 BCH @ 294.60 AND sold @ 500.00.  Other Income = 294.60, ST cap gain = 205.40.

This is what your backup phrase is used for - restoring the wallet.

Santander is also utilizing Ethereum as well.

Or, a scammer could know about that and use that information against people.  
Can't be like... "oh yeah, USAA is an investor, must be legit."  That's a dangerous conclusion.
I would confirm the hell out of this before jumping in.

When I read stories like this I always wonder if the OP paid any taxes.  I always assume "no".
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:18:37
Keeping records helps.  Value of btc at time of purchase (usd) + transaction fee + additional bank fee (if applicable) = historical cost.  When you purchase something, take that btc amount and multiply it by the usd of your historical cost.  Subtract that amount from whatever the btc was worth when you made the purchase.
I would do all of that, but who else will?  You're right, taxation will be a pain, and many people will commit tax evasion.
