In the US, absolutely. In other countries, still a maybe (since I’m unfamiliar with every country’s treatment of Bitcoin sales in terms of taxes).

What’s the likelihood of a transaction with a ~10 sat/B fee attached to it getting confirmed in the next few days or weeks? Or is it more likely to get dropped within the same time frame?

Fake account. :(

Agreed. Nevertheless, I sent a small(ish) amount. If this person is true to their word, great! If not, well, you learn from your mistakes.
I saw someone send 0.25 BTC to that address, so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
EDIT: It just seems too coincidental to me for someone to have picked up on the “going dark” part and taking advantage of it so quickly. But then again, like you said, this is the Internet. Anything is possible.

Hard to say. This post was made shortly after Tether_is_Fiat on Twitter said she'd be going dark for a while:

Sounds like he's just looking to offer another payment method. He wouldn't be asking otherwise, IMO.

I just bought more. TO THE MOON!

This makes sense. Thanks.

So the 0.3 mBTC in this example is just ignored? No loss or gain?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:13:52
So my net tax is $0 (despite a gain for me between 2013 and now), but they’d get taxed on the gain (in your example, $720). Right?

The number on the post corresponds to the parking spot and is used to pay for parking at a terminal in the middle of the block. The terminals don’t accept BTC; looks like someone just spray painted the logo on the post for the hell of it. The was one on the other side too.

Coinbase fee + $1/month regardless of the number of transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:45:37
It’s web-based too.

Looks like it’s now permanently closed:

The rules state you can't have any other writing on the card, so this will likely get rejected. What you could probably do is just have the Bitcoin logo and the QR code.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:58:59
Why so many?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:22:49
Just jumped on the bandwagon. In for 1 BTC. :)
