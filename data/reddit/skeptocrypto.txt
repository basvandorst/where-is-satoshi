Great work! Can’t imagine how much work went into compiling that infographic.

I live in a country the financial crisis hit real hard and right at the peak of it, the finance minister serving at the time suggested we all switch to btc. And that was back in 2015!!! Maybe he was a visionary, maybe he was a wack. But, like you said we the people at that specific moment in time and history had far bigger financial problems to consider.
At this point, such statement are great headlines but nothing more than wishful thinking and clickbait than anything else.

Good luck exposing the banking fraud while you wait for the institutional investors (aka the banks) to come lift btc and the alts out of their misery.
The point is, the crypto space has to first prove its worth with tangible products before the common people begin to trust it and start investing their fiat in it. 
Believe in it, give it time and work in the trenches with the devs supporting your fav projects be it btc, eth or anything. Then it will become obvious to everyone.

No prob. Greece. We’re still trying to get through the crisis alas, not very successfully.

I completely agree and you are right. There are other ways, too. But, the call for action was for all the people participating in the Yellow Vests movement. Let's be real, I don't think there are a lot of whales hanging around with that much btc in the local french boulangerie. The same goes for any other informal arrangement. As for btc atm's, those are slower than death. Imagine a crypto beginner looking into such an atm trying to figure how it works, how to put his/her money in and how to get his/her btc. Now, try to imagine tens or hundreds of them even though that borderlines sci-fi.

You and I and a few other people in this thread or reddit in general, may accept this truth. But, for the majority of the people in the rest of the world, money (fiat) is real and that is a cold hard fact. Change takes time, struggle and perseverance. It doesn't come with sensationalistic headlines and wishful thinking.

If the fractal is true, we’re looking at another year of bear market before the next real run. But, crypto will also have to prove its usefulness and real-life application in the meantime. I’m talking real, working projects. Not fancy websites and copy paste whitepapers anymore.

Just stating the obvious and still, I might be wrong just the same.

Struggling is an understatement. We have serious issues at every level and they blow over to the economy. I would go as far as to say that we have not matured as a country, people, society in comparison to the rest of Europe. As a result, our political system, which reflects our societal problems, is short-sighted, client-centric and extensively corrupted. Our economy, also faces increasing problems because over the past many decades it has come to depend on the different governments for sustenance. We have no significant industial sector. I could go on. 
Bitcoin made some headlines last year, like everywhere in the world, but in general it has a very low adoption rate. The capital controls that were imposed for the past 3 years or so and until last October made it even harder for funds (if there were any available for the median household) to be transfered or withdrawn.

Trying to follow the reasoning here. 
Let's assume for a moment that their supporters do withdraw all their money from the banks. Don't they still need the banks to transfer the money to any crypto exchange? 
And, even if they do and go out and buy all the bitcoin and alts they can with that money, doesn't that said fiat remain in the traditional banking system? Am I missing something?

That’s some totally BS news.
