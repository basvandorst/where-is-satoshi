This was the Jews rather than the Romans, but I think it's relevant.

I looked at your 'UK discussion'.  It actually seems to be about strategies for the US and the UK.


resolution powers to the top of a group by a single national resolution authority (single point
of entry), or applying resolution tools to different parts of the group by two or more
resolution authorities acting in a coordinated way (multiple points of entry). Which strategy is
most suitable to resolving the group will depend upon a range of factors
(i.e. they're going to grab the money from wherever they can get it)


unsecured creditors in the group, thereby avoiding the need for a bailout by taxpayers
I think bank account holders are unsecured creditors

I think if you look into it you'll find that the insurance wasn't fine.  The insurance is a guarantee from the government that triggers if the bank goes bankrupt, but the seizure was from people's accounts, and so doesn't cause the bank to go bankrupt, and so doesn't trigger the insurance.  This was explained by Jeroen Dijsselbloem etc. at the time.
The original plan was to seize  6.75% of accounts less than 100k euros, and 9.9% of accounts larger than this threshold.  They changed their minds to only sieze from the larger accounts.  Perhaps they changed their minds from pity for the smaller account holders, or perhaps they suspected that they'd cause a bank run across Europe and maybe the US too.  I know which reason I think is more likely.  Somehow they got away with it and most people think what you do: that the deposit insurance protected the smaller depositors.
It's clearly not worth destroying people's illusions for a small country like Cyprus.  It's cheaper for Germany to pay off the deficit themselves.  If the same thing happens to a large country, who knows what they'll do?

WU is expensive largely because of the security they have to provide for cash pickups.  If you can find a cheaper similar service from the UK, I'd be interested to hear about it.  I got Rebit to use a third party remittance service for the cash collection so that there would be a fair comparison with WU, but that increased the price by 3%.  Most importantly, I had to buy bitcoin in the UK, which is expensive.  I think for other countries, Rebit is probably the cheapest service for small and moderate amounts.

Sorry, I feel I haven't done a very good job.  Your question wasn't at all moronic.  I'm worried that none of the questions are moronic these days.  Without getting the morons on board, bitcoin will never succeed.
Let me have another go.  A private key is basically a big random number, so they're easy to make (although the common encoding of private keys has a checksum appended, and starts with a 5).
There is a complicated calculation that is easy for computers to do that takes a private key as input and produces a bitcoin address as output.  Bitcoin addresses are much shorter than private keys, so there are multiple private keys that give the same address.  In fact probably all addresses correspond to multiple private keys.
However, no one knows how to find a private key from an address .  Even though there are lots of solutions to each such problem, no one knows how to find any of them (except by starting with the address).
A normal bitcoin transaction specifies a destination address, or a set of them.  Once coins have been sent to an address, the key to that address is needed to send them on to another address.
A multisig address is a special address that has several private keys.  Once coins have been sent to that address, multiple signatures are required to send them on.
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:41:35
The fact that you can make withdrawals doesn't prove that it's not a ponzi like scheme.  In fact, that's how ponzi's work.  None of us knows whether bitstamp is solvent, so you are not justified in stating that it is fine. It's foolish to keep money on an exchange that you don't have to, and the absence of regular audits plus retrospectively applied 'aml' is suspicious in my opinion.
Anyone new to bitcoin should be informed that there is a long history of exchanges taking people's money, and that they should be very cautious, and on the lookout for any hints of problems.

I think the point is that making sure the bitcoin side is solvent will catch some frauds, for example when they've been robbed and don't have enough funds left to both replace the bitcoins and have a fiat float (like mt gox), then the fact that they have a problem will be exposed publicly.  It's true that if they don't audit the fiat side too, then they could cover up smaller thefts, but that doesn't mean that exposing larger thefts when they happen isn't valuable.
It's valuable because it will stop the exchange hiding certain kinds of problems from customers and potential customers.

When the cyprus banks didn't have enough money, the first solution was a deposit tax on all depositors.  This tax would be used to re-finance the bank so it wouldn't be bankrupt so the government deposit insurance scheme would not get activated.  The final scheme adopted didn't sidestep deposit insurance obligations in this way, and of course the US would never do anything so sneaky, so you are indeed 100% safe.

No CEO has come up to me in private and said 'Oh yeah, I think it's great that we can't own bitcoin'.  No startup has come to me and said 'I can't wait to hire a compliance officer'.  No altcoin developer has come up to me in private at one of these conferences and said 'Oh that's good.  I was thinking about making an altcoin.  I can't wait to file for my vague and nebulous licence process'.  In public though, they praise him, and engage him, and the only reason I can think of, in the face of the evidence, is fear.  Fear because he would not have his position based on merit.  If I came here as an unelected official who didn't have the ability to put a gun to your head and said 'hey guys, I have a great idea.  Let's make it so you have to go through a process before you're allowed to create an altcoin'.  I would be laughed out of the room.  He would be laughed out of the room in any bitcoin meeting because his ideas have no merit.  He wouldn't belong in this community with all of these intelligent and smart people.  He doesn't know how to program.  He doesn't know how to how to lead an organisation, be an executive, or do any of the things that would merit attention based on competence in this space.  The only attention he has is based on his ability to do violence, because we fear him.  We fear his ability to put us in prison.
And I say, and I don't take this lightly because there are people that went through amazing struggles that made bitcoin seem like not that big a deal - the civil rights movement. But I say we can take a page from some of the great people in history, and use the immortal words I like to say which is 'nah'... 'nah, I'm not going to engage'.  What happens if you throw a ban party, and no one shows up?  What happens if we have a hearing, and no one shows up other than Professor Williams with his 'bitcoin will definitely be at ten dollars' prediction?  Then what do we have?  We have an insignificant marginalised person, and Ben Lawsky can sit with Kim-Jong-il and have his party about banning bitcoin.  And no one shows up.  And we wall off New-York, and every developer out there puts a piece of code that blocks New York IP addresses, and they can be a desert in the world of wonderful and great innovation and technology.  And eventually their people are going to get a little annoyed about 'why can't I buy Dell stuff with bitcoin?' and a whole bunch of other people will do what Rosa Parks did, and say 'nah'.  We shouldn't be that afraid of him.  You know?  We shouldn't be that afraid of civil disobedience.  You don't have to be that brave to say 'nah' to a beaurocrat like Ben Lawsky who has no public mandate, was not elected.  I'll do it.
I believe that his regulations are a vast overstep of what he is entitled to do under New York law.  I believe they are unconstitutional, because I believe we have a right to transmit numbers: that I can say numbers to you, and I can speak out a bitcoin address 'one three five eight capital G...', whatever.  I have a right to speak that to you without fear of imprisonment.  We have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  We have a right to pursue the dream.  Maybe we're all wrong.  Maybe this won't change the world: help end poverty, create great innovation, but we have a right to pursue that.  So I think it's a vast overstep, so I wouldn't think that it's that radical to say 'let’s have some civil disobedience'.  So I would like to see New York -- a lot of people say it's going to be an example, 'New York is going to be an example of what happens'.  Well let's make it an example that they don't forget.  Let's not engage with this person.  Let's not engage with him and try to get his absolutely bad faith, corrupt, ridiculous set of laws knocked down to half so we think it's some kind of victory.  Let's completely and totally ignore it.  Let's not make any responses.  Let's not show up to any more of his hearings, which are by the way, media shows.
Those are media shows.  Charlie Shrem, I have no doubt in my mind, was arrested because he was in this community, and he was arrested on purpose, right before the hearing, so that Ben Lawsky could use it as a media tactic: to put the foundation on the defensive, to put the Winklevoss brothers, who were [investing with?] him on the defensive, and change the nature of those hearings.  And we were used.  We were used when he did that.  We were used when he goes on reddit and goes on CNBC laying groundwork for his political ambitions.  We are used.  We have given him authority in some ways.  We've treated him as if he's some sort of expert.  We've followed him on Twitter.  We 'like' his reddit posts.  So we have some blame, but it's not too late to turn our back on this person, who has proven to be operating in bad faith.  Not everyone is in bad faith.  Congressman Stockman [?] is acting favourably.

The key difference is that bitcoin uses a digital signature algorithm.  A signature using the digital signature algorithm can be verified by anyone who knows your public key, but can only be created by someone who knows the private key.  So the recipient can confirm that he's been paid without gaining the ability to sign on your behalf.
Credit and debit cards use a pants version of a digital signature algorithm called a secret number.  Anyone that sees the secret number can then spend on your behalf.

I wonder if Ghash.io might be controlled by an organisation aiming to harm bitcoin as cheaply as possible.  If such an agency also devoted mining power to stealing from other pools, such as Eligiius pool [has just seen]( this would have the effect of reducing other pools 'luck', which would drive their miners towards Ghash.
Miners don't spend 24 hours a day checking whether their pool has gone rogue, and anyway the random nature of block discovery can lead to long barren periods even without cheating.  GHash could mine a sidechain for a few hours before revealing it, which could devistate confidence in bitcoin.  I suspect getting to this position has cost them very little, at least compared to buying the hardware needed for a straightforward 51% attack.

I think this is foolish.  Yes, there are risks with paper wallets, but I think they're generally much smaller than the risks of letting a thrid party hold your coin.  It seems unlikely, but there could be a conspiricy of employees within coinbase to steal the coins, maybe combined with violence or kidnapping to compel crucial honest employees.
I know coinbase is a reputable company, but think how much coinbase has to steal, and how much easier it is to steal bitcoins than gold.  You don't need to steal them at the time, you just need to copy the cold storage private keys, and then weeks later make them vanish.
Rip offs have happened so frequently to bitcoin minding companies, for years.  I suspect more than half of them.  I'd agree that coinbase seems one of the least shady, and one of the least motivated to go rogue, but still, I think it's a real possibility.

I send money regularly from the UK to someone in the Philippines.  I looked on localbitcoins.com for how much it would cost me to buy a bitcoin using a bank transfer in the UK, and how much it could be sold for in the Philippines.  The figures were £302.75 and 18974php.  I also checked with the Western Union website how much it would cost for me to send 18974php, and it came out as £259.71.
That's not even close.  The markup on bitcoin buying and selling is massive compared to Western Union, presumably because someone has to earn an income on a comparitively small number of trades.
It is this markup that is stopping bitcoin being used for remittances, and unless somehow it massively shrinks, bitcoin will never take in this market.  On the other hand, if bitcoin was cheaper, I think a significant proportion of the remittance market would quickly switch to bitcoin.
I'd be interested to know how my calculations compared to a similar one sending from the US.  I suspect the UK is at the end of a chain for bitcoins, and the prices here are disproportionately large.

You could have a system like that, but it wouldn't be as secure because there would be a much stronger motivation for miners to collaborate together to cheat.

Bitcoin isn't run on a majority vote.  Each node authenticates all the bitcoin transactions ever.  (A majority in terms of hash power is used just to pick one from each set of doublespends, but does not have the power to move bitcoins from other people's wallets).
When a node starts up, it might be connected to rogue nodes that are trying to deceive it about what the consensus is.  If bitcoin used your latest balance system, then rogue nodes could broadcast fake balances, and effectively steal money.  If the rogue nodes had more hashing power than the rest, they could create a fake consensus.
You may not know about [digital signatures]( but they are key to authenticating transactions in the bitcoin system.  Every node checks the digital signatures for all bitcoin transactions ever.

'Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-
reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.'

I disagree that it's 'useless' because I think there is some chance that an auditor would report a fraudulent company.  It's similar to what happens with normal limited companies.  They are audited for the benefit of their owners (shareholders), and in egregious cases, the auditors sometimes raise concerns.  It's true that there are some egregious cases in which they don't raise concerns.  So I would say the system is useful but not perfect.
An auditor is likely the best we could get to confirm company fiat assets.
It's true that for bitcoin assets the company could publish statements digitally signed with its wallet keys, and I think that would be better, but even that is not a proof: the company might bribe a rich bitcoiner to sign the statements with his keys.

I got directed here from this post  and I noticed that no one warned you that it's dangerous to have imported a compromised address into a blockchain.info wallet because the wallet sometimes uses random address that it controls for change. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that this explains how you were robbed, but that it says that your blockchain wallet is now an unsafe place to keep coin.  I believe this because of what happened to some guy on reddit about six months ago, but blockchain.info might have fixed it since then.

I disagree (kind of).  The bitcoin price since the collapse of the bubble at the end of last year has generally been gradually drifting downwards, but very slowly, and has not really fallen lower than about four times the long-term price that obtained between the April last year bubble and the end-of-last-year bubble.
Bitcoin prices are directly determined only by people who buy and sell bitcoins.  Long term steady-state type prices like those above are not directly determined by traders or people using bitcoin for purchases or to move money, but by people investing, for the long term, in bitcoins.  An approximation I find useful is to think of long term prices as a measurement of the ratio of the rate that people are choosing to invest in bitcoin (measured in dollars) to the rate that people are choosing to divest of bitcoin (measured in bitcoins). The denominator of this ratio is, I believe, dominated by miners, who sell at a constant rate of 3600 btc per day.
I'll call the period between the April bubble and the December bubble 'period I', and the period since the December bubble 'period II'.  In period I, the price was typically about $100, which corresponds to an investment of $360k per day.  In period II, the price has been around $500, which corresponds to an investment of $1.8M per day.  This is serious money, and much more, I think, than the members of and similar people are investing.  Activity on does not seem that much higher in period II than it was in period I.  Furthermore, in period I, the price immediately responded to items of good or bad news about bitcoin, but in period II the immediate price responses aren't visible (or are much smaller).
I deduce that some big financial players have been investing steadily in bitcoin since the beginning of the year.  That is to say buying bitcoin directly rather than investing in startups etc.  Of course we've heard of some of these long term investors, but they must be more numerous or bigger now.  The size of the investment is about 150 days x $1.8M ~= a quarter of a billiion dollars.  This isn't big money on the scale of the hedge fund market or the gold market, but it does show that some people who control a lot of money are taking bitcoin very seriously.  I wouldn't expect this category of long-term investor to announce their investment before they'd completed it.
So, my conclusion, from the character of the bitcoin price chart, is that the big announcements aren't moving the price, or if they are, it's only through a slow influence on the size and number of long term buying programmes.  Also, that venture capital funding, which I believe is mostly used to pay people to develop infrastructure, is not having a direct effect on the price.  In fact its main influence so far is to form a subset of the set of big announcements.

No.  As well as miners, there are things called nodes in the bitcoin network.  Anyone that uses bitcoinQT is running a node.  Nodes will only accept and transmit transactions and blocks that follow the protocol.  In general if some people started using a modified protocol, you'd get a split in the network and it would be up to individuals to choose to use one or both versions.

The red flag laws were comparatively sensible.  People with no connection to cars were being killed by them.  The analogy would be if bitcoin gave the power to extract cash from other peoples' bank accounts.  Then licencing would be reasonable.  As it is, the only people that lost money to MtGox are people that sent money to MtGox.  A voluntary licencing scheme might be of use, but a compulsory and onerous licencing scheme kills* the main advantages of bitcoin for the sake of protecting those that don't want to be protected.

Most wallets are not associated with email addresses, though if it's a blockchain.info wallet, or a coinbase wallet, then it might be.  If you have a wallet associated with an email address, then you probably don't control the coins, and you should think about getting a proper wallet.  The instructions for changing the email address associated with a wallet will depend on the wallet provider.  Clearly an email address isn't sufficient information to allow compromise, or you could never send an email from it.  But if your email account has a weak password, or a password that you've used on a different service, then it is vulnerable.  Same with your wallet password.

** I couldn't catch every word, but here's my attempted transcript. **
Thanks for sticking around, I know it's the end of the day.  So I'm going to talk... like I said in Chicago, it's like the old movie saying, you try to avoid regulation, but you keep getting sucked back in.  I'd rather not talk about regulation.  I wish that the bit licence didn't exist.  I wish we didn't have to talk about it, but it's so damaging that I feel like I do have to.  I do have to address it.
But first, let me cover the other things that are on the Agenda.  We all know that bitcoin is an incredible tool for global change, and one place we see this is in the emerging markets.  I travel a lot.  I travel about half of the year outside the US: almost all of that in emerging markets, particularly the Middle East and other areas, and we can see first-hand the massive difference that bitcoin can make, because right now, as we speak, there are millions of people who do remittances from countries in places like the Middle East to their home countries, and that's a multi-billion dollar market that can be addressed.
So - there are groups that work on financial inclusion who track that more lives can be saved, as more people are entering the banking system, as more people leave the mass of the unbanked and have that base level of financial security, so it's not that much of stretch to say that bitcoin can actually save lives. It really can because it can help people out of poverty, and that really does save lives.  And there's a few different ways to do that that are really incredible.  One is as an economic tool. The power that bitcoin has as an alternative to traditional forms of currency which have been for a long time manipulated and in many cases not in favour of the people who are using those currencies.
Another way is the ease of use that Jason King talked about so eloquently earlier today.  The ease for people to make contributions, and that is just going to keep growing.  There's going to be a lot more great charity stories like the kind of things that Jason is doing, because bitcoin is such a superior tool for making those kind of donations, and we're going to see more of that with people who have an ability to give to those in need rather than going through the traditional intermediaries.
And the other thing that is a huge benefit is that for the first time in history, we can have rich people and poor people on the same financial platform.  People like Mark Andreessen who is a wealthy and successful person.  He owns bitcoin.  He can be on the very same financial platform as somebody who up until now couldn't get any type of bank account - at all. So that's really significant.  It's a really big deal, and it's just one of the many reasons that bitcoin is going to change the world.
The other part of it is the blockchain technology: things like what Etherium is doing will also have great potential, with smart contracts and other things, to change the world as we know it.  There's a massive amount of good that can be done with this.  There are lives that can be saved.  There are aspects of property ownership and health and all these other areas which can be radically transformed by decentralisation and things that i) bitcoin the currency allows, and ii) bitcoin the technology.  It's a very big deal, and you know that already.
Which is why it's particularly troubling that we have these kind of regulations that are coming out.  How many people have read this bit-licence, or read parts of it?  I'll give you a couple of highlights.  According to the bit-licence proposal by Ben Lawsky, an unelected official, who as I said on twitter, 'We have a person who was not elected by anyone, trying to create laws that no one asked for, for problems that don't exist'.  In his wisdom, Mr Ben Lawsky has said 'Bitcoin companies can't hold profits in bitcoin'.  This is serious.  'Bitcoin companies can't hold profits in bitcoin'.
Lawsky also says (aside) anybody ever hear of a company called Blockchain?  Anybody ever associate with Blockchain in any way?  You are breaking the law if Ben Lawsky's proposal goes through.  The proposal says that you cannot associate with companies that have a virtual address.  As everybody knows, Blockchain is progressive and cutting edge, not only in their technology, but also in their corporate structure: they're decentralised in some ways.  They don't have a central office in New York and they haven't filed their papers and they do their work on the blockchain and in bitcoin. You pay them in bitcoin and they pay their employees in bitcoin. Illegal to associate with them if you want to be licenced in New York!
Every business, licenced under this licence, must have a compliance officer.  That means if you're a three person start up, you're going to have to have one of them be a compliance officer.
One of my favourites: no alt-coins allowed without a licence.  You can't invent a new altcoin.  So we have doge-coin - if somebody in the highschool wants to invent cat coin, they will be handcuffed and thrown in jail, according to Ben Lawsky.
I could go on and on.  I'll just give one more of the many many many examples of the preposterous ridiculous anti-business, anti-competitive, anti-technology proposals in this ridiculous nonsense that this unelected official has come up with.  Tracking all names and addresses of every single person that purchases anything: Pepsi..., a donut..., you have to get their address.  It's so unbelievably ridiculous.
There is another provision: 'banks are exempt'.  Of course!  Banks are exempt from all of these things.  That serves a great public good, right?
Also, there's a law in New York that says that regulators like this, who are not law makers, they are not elected legislators, regulators are not allowed to just randomly create new things if there's a chance it will harm jobs, so New York Department of Financial Services actually says 'Oh no, this won't harm jobs in New York'.  How absolutely utterly offensive, and ridiculous.
So this is why I say, when a lot of people are like 'What's our strategy for dealing with Lawsky?'  I say 'absolutely not'.  He has proven himself to be -- and I don't mean this as rhetoric, I'm going to back it up in a second -- I don't mean this as rhetoric, trouble making talk.  It's easier for me to do what my colleagues do, and just say 'oh yes, great work', that's what I'm supposed to say as a registered investment professional of twenty years, I'm supposed to say 'great job, for your foresight in regulating bitcoin because it brings it "legitimacy"'.  But I cannot do that.  I have to say the truth.  And the truth, as hard as it may sound, as hard as it may be for me to say it, but if I'm really being honest, we have to call it like it is, and that is to say that Benjamin Lawsky is corrupt.  Why do I say that he's corrupt? Because clearly he's working with the banks.  There's absolutely no reason that I can think of that anyone can justify why banks should be exempt from this.  That's corruption.  I'm sorry.  It's a hard word, but it's true.
I believe he's dishonest, and I'll give you one simple example.  Ben Lawsky met a fellow named Charlie Shrem, a friend of many of ours, almost every week, for a year, and then Ben Lawsky had his media show: his hearing, and the day before the media show, Charlie Shrem was arrested.  And by the way, Charlie Shrem would never have been arrested if he'd worked for HSBC, for being a suspect that he failed to file a suspicious activity report.  I mean, give me a break.  He's not exactly Bernie Madoff, who by the way, just in case we forget, that's Bernie Madoff the fraudster.  Bernie Madoff was a regulator.  He was on the board of NASDAQ.  He was chairman of the board of NASDAQ, and he was on the board of directors of NASD who's the main regulator, so let's not go out there too much in always thinking that the regulators are always creatively[?] preventing fraud.  They didn't prevent one of the greatest frauds by one of their own.  But anyway, Ben Lawsky claims it's a complete coincidence that Charlie was arrested.  Does anyone believe that?  I'm just calling it how I see it.
I believe he's corrupt.  I believe he's lying to us.  I believe he's dishonest, and I believe he's violent.  Why is he violent?  Because he's threatening you - everybody who raised their hand and said they used Blockchain - everybody who thinks they might want to create an alt-coin - everyone who wants to create a business in China or Europe or the Middle East who will have one customer in New York.  He is threatening us with violence: he is threatening us to put us in prison when he has no mandate to do so from the public.  He was not elected by us.  So I call him violent.
I call him corrupt.  I call him a liar.  I call him violent.  So why on earth are people in this space running to deal with this person?  If you must reach out to public officials, reach out to ones who have some semblance of caring what the public says.  Reach out to Andrew Cuomo.  Call him out on this.  'Governor Cuomo is anti-jobs, he's anti-progress, he's anti-technology'.  Those are facts because he is the one who appointed Ben Lawsky.  Personally I think it's a futile effort to deal with somebody, and I wouldn't do it in private life.  You wouldn't do it in business.  Why we feel the need to engage this person who's proven themselves dishonest and corrupt and violent?  Why?  We wouldn't do it in any other situation.  The only reason I can think of that we do it is the same reason that my friends and colleagues praise New York in public, on their tweets and then privately tell me that it's a complete joke.

Financial services can be thought of as a big machine that takes money in and gives money out.  They can't actually create value: just re-distribute it.  It is surprising that they form such a large part of the economy these days, and it is natural to wonder whether they are worth the fees they charge.
New York is the world centre for financial services, and it creams off a significant proportion of the world's economic profit.  Any efficiencies that bitcoin introduces, and any alternative facilities it creates are money off the bottom line for financial services and New York.
It could be argued that introducing legislation that effectively blocks bitcoin use is a sensible strategy for New York, even if they can't admit it.  I'm hoping that the rest of America and the world will understand that the bit-licence suits New York very well, but at the cost of everyone else.  Other juristictions would be wise to allow their citizens as much freedom as possible to trade with each other, and allow the economy to naturally route around the New York obstruction.

We should demand that exchanges implement that Maxwell idea and sign messages each month including the latest block hash with all their addresses.  They should also use the Maxwell system for their cash accounts, and have their claimed total cash holdings audited and certified by chartered accountants.  Finally, the CEOs should sign an undertaking to make it public immediately whenever cash or bitcoins are lost or even temporarily not controlled.
There have been far far too many bitcoin companies that have lost funds.  Far far too many customers ripped off.  Bitcoin companies could and should be setting an example to fiat companies of openess and security.  Instead they are lagging behind.
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:11:43
This is an important line of thought.  I have a few comments.
Surely a large part of mining expenses are purchasing the chips, which lose their value over the succeding couple of months.  As the block halving approaches, purchasing chips will seem less attractive, and I suspect the hash rate increase will slow down substantially in preparation.
My feeling is that bitcoin price is approximately equal to the quotient of the rate at which people are investing in bitcoin by the mining rate.  When the mining rate halves, I would expect the price to jump up substantially increasing the rewards for miners.
One of bitcoin's strengths is the rigidity of its protocol.  Every time there's a protocol change, it weakens bitcoin a little bit.
I agree that there is something to worry about here, and my approach is just hoping for the best, but I think we should be wary of fiddling with bitcoin when it might not be necessary.

You probably shouldn't get the tenents to send you their btc address because most bitcoin users use a wallet that won't let you control which address coins are sent from.  I think the thing to do (if you want to run your system manually) is to send your tenants your btc address, and use a different address for each tenent, and keep a record of which address applies to each tenent.
A cautious tenent would want a record of you telling them the address to pay into so that they could use the blockchain as proof of payment.  A letter or email from you should be sufficient.
Are there any fees or expenses associated with your current system for receiving (fiat) payment.

My suggestion would be to use irc.  It would be a bit of a pita for a one-off, but the steps are
* download an irc client
* connect to a server on the freenode network
* type '/join bitcoin-otc-uk'
* in that channel, type ';;guide' and read it to understand the reputation system.  Don't trade with someone who doesn't have a good reputation there.
* if you're just selling bitcoins, you won't need to register with the reputation system (unless you want to build up a reputation), but you will be expected to send first.
* you might need to hang out for a few evenings to find someone to trade with at a good price.
If instead you use localbitcoins or mycellium to meet someone in real life, do it in a public place that's awkward to run from, or maybe covered by CCTV like a bank lobby.
If you use localbitcoins to sell for a bank transfer, only trade with someone who has a good reputation there.

I think I first heard about bitcoin in 2012.  I read a news article that claimed that the value of bitcoin was due to the cost of the calculations miners carried out.  I could see that this was nonsense, but I foolishly believed the article and dismissed bitcoin as something that couldn't work.
My next recollection of bitcoin was in March 2013.  Someone was irritating me by replying to lots of financial disaster posts on reddit with just the phrase 'bitcoin not affected'.  I realised that if bitcoin had not dissolved in the few months since I first heard of it, that there must be something more to it than I thought, and that since I knew something about maths and cryptography, I should research it.  I read the white paper and was blown away.  From 1 to 5 in fifteen minutes.
This was during a bitcoin bubble, and it wasn't clear to me how high the price could go.  I knew I wanted to buy some, but it took me a few days to work out how: I drove to meet a taxi-driver advertising on localbitcoins, and handed him £200 for 3 btc.  I've been hodling ever since.
I too think we might be reaching a tipping point.  It seems that bitcoin for remittances is becoming cheaper than traditional methods.  I suspect this money saving will spread by word of mouth over the next few months, greatly increase bitcoin adoption.

This is part of the political system.  It may seem radical in some ways, but this is what you do.  You do civil disobedience.  You reach out.  You do protests.  You reach out to governor Cuomo.

Americans who don't even understand bitcoin know in their hearts what is right and wrong, and there's something that rubs people the wrong way about having innovation stomped or squashed.
If you want to reach out to people, and you believe in the political process, that's great.  I'm not here to debate the merits of anarchy verses engagement.  If you want to engage, that's great.  Engage Ben Lawsky's boss, and better yet, engage people in places like Texas and New Hampshire, and California, who are more progressive, who don't have these ridiculous and onerous requirements.  Engage people in other countries.  You can engage.  You can make your responses, but I would just say it's a futile effort to do so with somebody who's proven themselves to be most likely corrupt and dishonest and violent, if not then completely and totally incompetent.

Lives will be saved by this technology, in my opinion.  People will be lifted out of poverty.  The world will be a better place.  We all believe that.  Maybe we're right, maybe we're wrong, but we have a right to pursue that: to talk amongst ourselves, to fund these companies, to work on these companies, to work on these ideas, create new inventions like new alt-coins, and pursue this.  And we shouldn't be in fear.  We shouldn't live in fear.  There are people who've fought much tougher fights than this and made it through.  Let's release the fear and focus on the positive aspects of this, and let's move forward.

Question: 'Tell me how you really feel'
It's a lot easier for me politically, career-wise.  I mean, I'm friends with CEOs who make these positive [seeds?], I try and be friends with everybody in this space.  As this space gets larger, it gets harder.  It's easier to just tow the party line, and say what you're expected to say.  But with something so important...  I believe in bitcoin.  I believe that it is the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in in my life, and I cannot sit here and lie or be a party to lying and claim that something's ok when it's not.  So that's why I speak out.  I encourage more people to do it.
Question: 'Where will the divide be with pro-regulation vs anti-regulation people?'
I wish that I could never talk politics because my goal is to not turn off anyone, although Ben Lawsky may not have particularly liked my speech just now.  My goal is to not turn people away; unless they've proven themselves to be a complete and total enemy, and by talking about principles like non-aggression, you turn some people off.  Ninety nine percent of Americans are either Republican or Democrat.  Only one percent of people voted for Gary Johnson, so if you try to make it from a political angle, you can turn people off.  I don't want to do that.  So I'd rather not mention politics at all, but it's interesting because the roots of bitcoin came from this sort-of libertarian movement, and it is so intertwined.  It really is about freedom, and you kind of can't have both.  It's not that I want to go out and preach to people about the non-aggression principle.  By the way, I have a very, very simple philosophy: it's not ok to harm another human being with violence unless it's in defence, or unless they harm you.  That's it.  Ben Lawsky's rules cannot work with that.  He has to do pre-emptive violence against the non-violent.
Now that's a philosophy.  That kind of a libertarian leaning philosophy, and unfortunately I can turn people off by that.  I'd rather have republicans and democrats and independents and everyone else on board.  I'd rather talk about the good things the technolgy can do.  About how it can do remittances, and how it can help charity, and how it can help people in their day to day lives, but unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, or perhaps by design, it is so intertwined.  It really is - decentralisation really is about freedom.  If the tyrants of the future new what bitcoin would do, they would kill every person in this room if they could.  Hosni Mubarak would have killed a thousand people to stop Twitter had he only known what it would do.  So some of these things are intertwined: freedom and technology and new ideas and the ability to share is intertwined.
And where will it be in a year?  I think that there is an awakening, and you can't stop an idea.  An idea whose time has come can't be stopped by guns.  It's here.  It's here to stay, and nobody's going to be able to stop it.  They can try, but it will just come back stronger, just like other things in technology have, and people have learned and people will be talking about these ideas, they're going to stop and say 'wait a minute.  Is it really cool to be hand-cuffing these guys for transmission of math', and I think that things have been put in motion that won't be stopped and are going to change the world, so I think that down the future, Ben Lawsky will go down in history with the Luddites and the people who wanted to ban the internet as somebody who made a big mistake, and he will be laughed at, and we will all see a newer and better world because of this great technology.
Thank you.

I think a zero confirmation solution would be ideal, but maybe have some monitoring so you would find out if users made double spend attacks on you.

I'm a bit concerned by this, but perhaps my concern is caused by my ignorance.  There is a bitcoin protocol and there is a reference implementation, and there are other implementations, but I don't fully understand the relationship between them.  I know the reference implementation changes sometimes, and I guess the bitcoin protocol is defined to be whatever the reference implementation implements, but who has the authority to make this definition if bitcoin has no authorities, but instead is just a protocol?
De-facto people can use their own version of the protocol, and the authority of the reference implementation comes from the fact that almost everyone uses it or uses a codebase that changes with it.  This situation is a retreat from the ideal of having a fixed protocol with several independent implementations.  It might be necessary because the protocol isn't good enough to set in stone, but I think having a de-facto authority and a changable protocol makes bitcoin less robust than it would be in a world in which it was possible to have a fixed protocol and no authority.

I don't think it's that simple, though for the current prospective fork it is.  To make a fork with minority miner support (but presumably overwhelming merchant and customer support to make it worthwhile) the revolutionaries could introduce a flag somehow to blocks, and after some block number, only accept blocks with this flag.  That would cause a real hard fork because neither side would build on the other's blocks.

With 0.45 of the mining power, the expected number of blocks per block is 0.45, and the variance in the number of blocks per block is 0.45*(1-0.45)^2+(1-0.45)*(0-0.45)^2 = 0.45*(1-0.45) = 0.2475.
Expectations and variances are additive, so over 1000 blocks the expected number of blocks is 450 and the variance is 247.5.  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is about 15.7.
To get 750 blocks is an excess over the expected number of 502.5, which is about 32 standard deviations.  On [Wikipedia]( the table for a normal distribution only goes up to 7 standard deviations, which has a probability of 1 in 390682215445.  [Wolfram Alpha] ( gives about 1 in 10^224

This is essentially correct.  Although you can't try out all possible strategies with simulations, you can show using mathematics that every strategy has a negative expectation, which means almost certainly it's a bad thing to do.
Exceptions are 1) when you get sufficient pleasure from gambling to make up for losses, 2) when you have a high level of skill at a game with a skill element such as poker, and 3) when you have strange personal circumstances that make a gambling win very valuable to you, but a loss unimportant, for example if you will be knee-capped unless you can pay off a debt in full but you don't have enough money.
To repeat in normal circumstances, any gambling strategy is a bad idea.

I think the tax part of transaction fees is just a tax on the transaction fees themselves, eg tax on profit for the credit card companies.
It's true that the CC companies provide protection for buyers, but it's expensive protection that is not always good value.  At the moment the costs from bad suppliers are unfairly distributed over all suppliers.  I believe bitcoin will allow the decoupling of the protection from the payment method, and remove the monopoly on the supply of that protection from the credit card companies.  This will allow honest suppliers to offer cheaper prices, and should make protection cheaper and optional.

Sorry to be rude, but your explanation sucks.  I can tell you some things about why it is hard to understand, but I suspect that I can't tell you enough to enable you to make it easy.
I guess it would be the buyer that creates the escrow transaction and that he uses the send page for that, but you don't say either of these things.
I guess 'receiving party' is the same as 'merchant', but why have two different names?  And if you must have two different names, you should state that they refer to the same entity.
How does the receiver get the transaction ID?  Presumably from the buyer, but you don't say so, and you don't say how the buyer gets it.
Why does the receiver need to give the receiving wallet address?  Is it the same address that the buyer put in the 'receiver address' field?  If so, why isn't it encoded in the transaction ID?  If it's not the same, why not?
Where does the receiver get the special code to send to the mediator?  In fact surely the mediator should only be involved in the case of a dispute?
You give three possible scenarios, but then you don't say what happens in each scenario as far as I can see.  I guess you are describing scenario 3 in the last paragraph.  Assuming this is so, I don't see why the receiver needs to give his private key to Meklebar.  Shouldn't the coins just be sent to his address?
There are also some typos.
Sorry to be negative.  I think it's potentially a very useful service, but getting the code right is not more important than a good explanation.

Bitcoin public addresses are hashes of members of a mathematical object called an elliptic curve which has a couple of relevant properties.
Firstly, there's an elliptic curve point p(n) for every whole number n (although since there only a finite number of points, eventually you get dupicates).
Secondly, there is an operation to 'add' elliptic curve points, which corresponds to addition of whole numbers.  ie p(n) + p(m) = p(n+m).
The whole numbers are essentially the private keys, and for a private key n, the hash of p(n) is the corresponding public key.  It's computationally intractable to deduce n from p(n), because otherwise people could steal bitcoins (from addresses that have been spent from).
A simple protocol for a determinisitic wallet would store a whole number n, and a deterministic set of offsets: m1, m2 etc.  The private keys used for the wallet would be n+m1, n+m2 etc.
The watch only wallet would be told p(n), and could therefore deduce the public keys p(n)+p(m1), p(n)+p(m2) etc. from knowledge of m1, m2 etc.
Actual deterministic wallets use more complicated protocols to get additional properties, but this is the basic idea.

I suspect that only a small proportion of US currency is held for use in trades between two other countries.  Maybe more is held by people that don't want to be subject to the inflation of their own currencies.
For example  says that the amount of dollar hard currency has increased by 42% in five years, and that 84% of the  increase in cash since 1990 has been in the form of $100 bills.  It describes the situation in Argentina where there is a black market in dollars, and people use suitcases of $100 bills when they buy houses.
The dollar isn't ideal for foriegn horders because effectively they pay a tax when the US prints more dollars.  This tax allows the US to print money and thus increase spending beyond what would otherwise lead to high inflation.  As John Connally, a former Secretary of the Treasury said, the dollar "is our currency, but your problem."
If these foriegn holders of dollars find bitcoin to be more convenient, then there could be a significant repatriation of dollars, and presumably a risk of high inflation as they return.

People invented various internet cash schemes before bitcoin.  The advantage bitcoin had is that it was the first to solve a technical problem: how to prevent double-spends in a distributed system.  Once that was solved, the bitcoin system as you see it today became possible.
The bitcoin system itself probably won't get hacked.  There's been more than a billion dollar's worth of bitcoin since April, so lots of the worlds cleverest hackers will have looked hard for vulnerabilities, and we'd know if they'd found any.

Nixon's actions confronted the world with an uncomfortable choice, and the world chose to use unbacked fiat for trade.
I like the analogy with bitcoins because it's thought provoking.  It's not by any means perfect, but the similarities and differences to the bitcoin situation are illuminating.
By 1971, almost no one actually used the ability to swap between dollars and gold.  By contrast, in the bitcoin economy, I suspect exchange to and from cash happens at both ends of a bitcoin transaction.  In other words, I paid cash for bitcoins, bought some socks with the coin and then the merchant sold the coin for cash again.  The length of the chain of non-cash transactions was 1, which means that the cost of the exchange to and from fiat (maybe 10%) had to be amortised over a single transaction.  If the chain length could be doubled to two non-cash transactions, then the burden on each transaction would halve.
The fact that money can be saved by increasing chain length will motivate users to do their best to extend the chain.  The thing holding them back is a lack of coincidence of wants with other bitcoin users: it's because of the network effect and the current low level of bitcoin adoption.
The more bitcoin is available as an option for purchaces, the longer the exchange chains will grow, and the more attractive bitcoin will be as a means of exchange.  I think it's likely that we will at some point get to the pre-1971 stage where everyone accepted dollars without thinking about converting them to gold before they spent them again.
That point will be the end of the battle for bitcoin adoption though.  The dollar was pegged to gold but bitcoins aren't pegged to the dollar: their dollar-price floats.  There is no bitcoin Nixon to default on his obligation to  exchange your bitcoins for dollars.  Dishonesty wasn't baked into the Bretton-Woods gold-backed dollar system, but the motivation to be dishonest was.  Bitcoin from the start has been backed by nothing, and has been transparent about the fact.  It doesn't even have a government to give it value by demanding tax payments in bitcoin.
A common reaction to bitcoin is that since it has no backing, it is like a man lifting himself by his own bootstraps, and that it will soon be back to its original value of zero.  I believe though that bitcoin is backed by its utility as a means of exchange, and that that backing is more reliable than being backed by a country because there is no bitcoin convertability obligation to default on, and no debasement through excess printing or alloying is possible.

It's a funny thing.  If I buy bitcoins with cash from my next door neighbour, it doesn't change the amount of cash in the economy, just redistributes it.  If a week later the price has doubled, and I sell half back to him, then I get all my cash back.  It's not clear to me that such transactions affect the rest of the economy much.  It might just be that the net effect of bitcoins is to be a new well of credit so that people feel a bit richer.  Funny business economics.

Hi, I think I have some technical knowledge (I made a [gif]( demonstrating elliptic curve associativity on wikipedia for example). My knowledge about the details of bitcoin, segwit, LN etc. certainly has many large holes. However, I prefer r/btc to here. I think saying that I 'follow Roger Ver' is misleading, and I don't feel that my heart is full of hate. However, my impression is that blockstream have effectively taken over the core code and are introducing changes to it (such as their segwit) which are harmful to bitcoin but beneficial to blockstream. It would be fair to say that I am upset about this and about what the top mod has done to this subreddit and bitcointalk. I don't think I'm rabidly bitter though.

I imagine someone setting up a hundred thousand email addresses and subscribing them all to your site.

I don't think AES-256 is part of the bitcoin protocol.  SHA-256 is used, and so is ECDSA.  Also, bruteforcing a bitcoin address is easier than bruteforcing SHA-256 because a bitcoin address has a further hash to reduce it to 160 bits.  Practically speaking, it's still impossible though.

If bitcoin really catches on, then in countries that don't regulate, small shops will buy and sell bitcoins to people that walk in off the street.  This would make the money-transfer aspect of money laundering impossible to monitor, so it's likely that governments are going to have to make a choice between introducing draconian regulations and losing one of their main handles on the criminal economy.

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.

Mining is very cheap.  Anyone with the qt-client on their computer can set it mining.  The thing stopping people mining is not that it's expensive, but that it's expensive to mine enough to get a decent return.  Actually the cost for a non-miniscule mining setup is approximately equal to the value of the coins that will be mined by the setup.  That is not a coincidence.  If ASICs get very cheap, the difficulty will increase until you need lots of ASICS to mine a reasonable number of coins, and it will still cost a lot to get a reasonable return.

Everything of value only has value because people agree that it does.  Something might be important to just one person, maybe for sentimental reasons, but we wouldn't normally describe such a thing as 'valuable'.
The important question to ask is why people feel that a thing has value, and whether that feeling is likely to be short-lived or long-lived.
For bitcoin, the answer to that question is tricky because the answers are
1) It's a way of transmitting value over the internet or in person, and
2) It's a way of storing value securely,
and these answers only make sense if bitcoin already has value.  So the reason for bitcoin value is self-referential.  It's pulling itself up by its own bootstraps.  Nevertheless, I think this reasoning works.

No one knows what will happen in the case of a bank bail-in.  There are unlikely to be special rules for bitstamp, so probably some of their money would be stolen and some more would be frozen.  How they would react to this would be up to them.  In my opinion the most fair approach would be that holders of bitcoins at bitstamp would be unaffected, but holders of fiat at bitstamp would have some stolen and some frozen in the same proportions as the bitstamp account.  There is no guarantee though.  I minimise the amount of time that I have any exposure to the exchanges.

I've heard of this a few times.  One problem is that if you get blockchain.info to email you a copy of the wallet, that bypasses 2FA, and you are relyant on whatever password you have set up at the time (email is not secure).

Dear lovebitcoin,
in the UK we also have problems sending money to exchanges although the problems are not as bad as yours are now.  Alternative markets like [bitbargain] ( and [bittylicious]( have appeared (as well as [localbitcoins]( which is international) that let buyers send bank transfers directly to sellers at the same time as the bitcoins are kept in escrow.  These systems seem to have a higher overhead than a proper exchange, but work quite well.  Do you think that such a system could work in China? Thanks.

@_date: 2013-04-07 08:56:01
Perhaps I've misunderstood you, or am mistaken.  The word that makes me suspicious is 'already' in 'reject blocks which omit any transaction which already had six confirmations'.  'Already' means 'earlier' in some sense, but the sense can't be 'occurs in an ancestor block' because the protocol already ;) guarantees that each valid block respects the transactions of its ancestor blocks.  The only other sense for 'already' that I could think of was temporal, but as I say, that seems problematic to me.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:03:57
Things would be a lot worse if we didn't have 'made up crimes' in my opinion.  For example, there are laws about having a roadworthy car.  No one is harmed by someone driving an unroadworthy car unless there is an accident, so if I understand you correctly, the accident is the real crime, and driving an unroadworthy car is a 'made up crime'.
But, because of human nature, if it was legal to drive unroadworthy cars, lots of people would, because they would believe that they wouldn't have an accident.  The result of this would be that lots of innocent people would be killed and maimed.

In terms of how much money and effort I'd advise investing, it obviously depends very much on your circumstances.  Bitcoin might be worthless next week, so don't invest more than you can afford to lose (ie hide from your wife ;)  On the other hand, I think there's a big chance that its value will go up tenfold or more, and if it does, I'll be kicking myself if I haven't taken a decent sized risk.

I think this is sensible approach, as long as you don't really need the return from the mining.  I'm surprised more people don't do it.  We already have a lot of variance in our lives, and adding a bit more, with a limited downside, doesn't do much harm.  On the other hand, I guess you save on some fees for being in a pool.
You are taking on  less variance than someone who buys a lottery ticket, and you are getting a return in expectation  for taking the variance, while they pay in expectation for their variance.
Finding blocks is well modelled by a poisson process, so the variance in the number of blocks you find is approximately equal to the expected number you find.  Thus the ratio of the variance to the expected income is 25btc.  If pools collect a 1% fee, this gives a ratio of variance to cost of 2500btc, or about $200k.  If you don't need more money at this point in your life, and expect to earn much more than $200k over your life, then this seems to be a good financial move.

In 24 hours, 24x6 = 144 blocks are generated.  If they have 36% of the hashing power, then their expected number of blocks would be 0.36*144 = 51.4 blocks, and since the number is approximately Poisson distributed, the variance would be about the same 51.4.  48% of the blocks would be 69 blocks, an excess of 17.6 or about 2.5 standard deviations.  It's going to happen about once every hundred days.

A very sad story.  I hope she forgives you.
This won't be any immediate help, but you are still thinking about what you did in a disfunctional way: a way that might lead you to do it again.  When you say 'When I should have cashed out', you implicitly imply that there was an earlier stage at which you were correct not to cash out (ie stop betting).  The fact that there was a period when you were winning was just a matter of luck, and at each point the rational action would have been to stop (or in the first place, not to start).
My guess is that your opinion is that you don't have a gambling problem, but you do, and you should do something about it: eg gambler's anonymous.

I prefer the idea of sending to miners because it makes mining bitcoin more lucrative, and therefore makes bitcoin more secure.  You should see your transactions not getting to block chain if someone tries to keep them for themselves, and if they did, you could send them here 
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:57:32
This is very interesting.  I think it might be a fraud.  You are correct that the 'naive' payoff is positive for all participants, but things are not as they seem.  If you look at the distribution of the amounts lost (when the 31/32 chance doesn't come off), it is an extremely long tailed distribution -- so long tailed that it doesn't have a finite mean.
This means that there is a significant chance that the size of the gambles will get to any reasonable amount.  For example, there is an approximately 1 in 6 chance that the gambles will get to 100 bit coins.  What are they going to do then?  If you think that someone might gamble 100 bit coins, then lets look at 10 million bit coins (all the bit coins in existence).  There is a more than 1% chance that any chain will get to 10 million bitcoins before it fails.  What are they going to do then?
As far as I can see they must rig the odds somehow or they'd soon price themselves out of players.  Unless there's a mistake in my sums, they're dishonest.
[Edit] I see they aren't actually dishonest, they say that if no-one buys the bar for a day it resets.

I don't see why bitcoin would be widely used there yet.  The MPisa service already seems to give the ability for individuals to transfer money between themselves within the country, and it is probably more expensive to use bitcoin rather than Western Union to transfer money into the country because of the fees, inconvenience and risk currently associated with buying and selling bitcoins.
I think these fees, inconvenience and risk for conversion betweeen bitcoin and fiat are possibly the most important indicator of the viability of the bitcoin economy, and I'd love to quantify them in different countries, and track them over time.  Specifically, I'm interested in the percentage cost to transfer fiat to bitcoin and bad again to fiat.  However, even for my own country (the UK) I'm having difficulties evaluating them.
The fees, inconvenience and risk are to a large extent tradeable in the sense that if you are prepared to put up with inconvenience, you can mitigate much of the risk and fee.  In order to quantify, I'll choose the methods of exchange that minimise the inconvenience and risk, and just look at the fees.  I'll also only consider methods that are easy to use.
In the UK, there is a service that will give you a listing of people who are currently online and willing to sell you bitcoins in return for a UK bank transfer (these bank transfers are free).  The sellers are pretty heavily vetted, and have most of the risk and inconvenience.  The markup relative to gox varies greatly, but a handy chart lets me estimate it at 10%.  
For the other side of the deal: selling coins, I don't think there currently is a method that is convenient and low risk.  Perhaps the closest is to sell via UK bank transfer to a highly rated buyer found on localbitcoins.  I don't count this as convenient because it's not possible to tell who is online there, so you have to pick a likely candidate and wait and hope for the best and cancel and try again if he doesn't appear in a reasonable time.  So, actually I think it's not possible to conveniently cycle money from fiat to bitcoin and back.  However, for the purposes of getting a number, I note that the current sell price is £62 on LBC compared to a buy price on the 'convenient' service of £72.  So the cost of transfering backwards and forwards is 1-62/72 = 14%.
14% is a sorry state of affairs.  Much more than Western Union.  Assuming the rate is similar in different parts of the world, people aren't going to be using bitcoin to transfer money.

I agree that children are a very good use case for bitcoin.  They don't have credit cards, but want to purchase things on the internet.  There is a bit of a chicken and egg situation with not much for them to buy (I can think of the humble bundle) and not many kids with bitcoins.  Improving either side of this relation would be helpful.
I gave my God son a small amount of bitcoin after explaining the system to him, showed him the transactions and blocks coming in on  and the trades appearing on 
I didn't tell him about the bitcoin gambling sites, but he's capable of discovering them himself.  I'm not sure whether exposing children to gambling is a good thing or a bad thing.  Maybe they could become addicted to gambling at an early age, but maybe they will have the experience of losing all their money when it doesn't really matter, and it will serve as an innoculation.

There is an argument that the dollar has value because americans have to pay their taxes in dollars, and if they don't men with guns come to lock them up.  This creates a demand for dollars as tokens that stop you getting locked up, and once there is a base demand for the currency, people can have confidence that it has some value, and that confidence helps it to be used as a means of exchange and value storage.
[edit]  I suppose this implies that if people made credible promises to provide services for a number of bitcoins that is specified now then that might help to put a floor on the value of a bitcoin.

What you've described is one possibility.  Anyone could register an address as clean and then send their coins to their clean address before spending them with a collaborating merchant.  This would allow law enforcement to, probabalistically at least, identify the parties in a large proportion of transactions.  Bitcoiners could subvert this by
* using coinjoin
* creating a fresh address whenever they receive coins
* boycotting collaborating merchants
I suspect the ultimate intention is to have an amnesty at some point at which people can register addresses by submitting identity documentation.  At that point all the coin in those addresses will become clean, but after that point any coin that has some ancestor inputs that have touched an unregistered address since the last amnesty will be considered dirty.  It will be a brave person who doesn't register most of his coin at the amnesty, and from that point dirty coins will be avoided by almost everyone (in the West at least).  Bitcoin will have turned into an Orwellian nightmare currency, more monitored than even bank transactions, and much worse than cash.

It's good to have an update on this.  I think in hindsight, the decision to have a fixed price in bitcoin was a mistake because of the huge price changes in the value of a bitcoin. Once Trezors are in production, it will only be sensible to sell them at a price that reflects production cost plus a proportionate profit rather than some value that fluctuates with the cost of bitcoin.  
Since the value of a bitcoin is so high now compared to when they started, I expect there will be a price drop: currently the cheap trezor costs as much as a laptop, and the more expensive one costs the same as a servicable second hand car.
It would be nice if they could recognise those that made pre-orders somehow, either by some visible distinction between pre-order trezors and later trezors, or by including some potential memorabelia that might become collectable if bitcoin and Trezor goes really mainstream.

'blockchain.info' is not The Blockchain.  The blockchain is the agreed public ledger, which by definition contains no orphan blocks.  I suppose blockchain.info stores orphan blocks because knowledge of them would be useful to understand double-spend attacks and network splits and also because they are a diagnostic of the health of the network.  My guess is that orphans aren't saved on every node, but I'm ready to be corrected by someone that's actually looked at the bitcoind code.

The way I see it, there are two suspicious things that you have be aware of.  One is a line of transactions linking you to the original theft, the second is a large unexplained amount of money.  By gambling away most of the small wallets you made, you create lines of transactions from the theft to satoshi dice, and from there presumably into the wider bitcoin community.  It would be difficult to follow all of these lines I think, but maybe the signature of a sequence of dice wins (paid back into the originating wallet, so probably quite distinctive) would require a bit of extra mixing to cover.

I think only very draconian laws would be able to stop significant use of bitcoin, and my guess is that they won't be brought in until it's too late to be politically acceptable.  Both the bitcoin ecosystem and the government move very slowly.  The government is like a slow, strong, clumsy giant, and somehow a bit stupid.  Bitcoin is like the tide coming in, and I don't thing the giant is going to be able to stop it.
I would say bitcoin, or cryto-currencies generally are like a force of nature. Once they been released (ie the technology has been discovered) then even governments can only slow them down a bit.  Really we have to watch them and try to handle their consequences, which will be good and bad.

If the US made bitcoin illegal, you'd be breaking the law now.  But if the US made bitcoin illegal reddit would undoubtedly disable that functionality somehow, though it's not really reddit who provided the functionality, so they'd have to block the bot's accounts and the accounts of other bitcoin bots as they sprang up.
But what about foreign websites?  The US can push a lot of other countries into adopting its laws c.f. the war on drugs and the fight against 'piracy', but not all other countries, and they will be fighting a desire for people to use bitcoins, and a feeling of 'why shouldn't I use bitcoins to make an honest trade?'  There will be 1000 avenues for bitcoin to sneak into people's lives.  At least with drugs, there is a physical thing that has to be moved around, which gives law enforcement a handle on the issue.  Digital stuff is much harder for them, and in the end it's a battle they're never going to win.
An online game might link its game currency to bitcoin, and they'd have to ban the game.  What if the linkage was made weaker somehow, and there were 1000 different games with different policies?
The fight against 'piracy' has made it so that it's easier for the financially comfortable to pay for music rather than pirate it, but for people with less money (and thus more motivation), piracy is still the norm, and it's the norm too outside of the first world.  If it was banned, bitcoin might follow this model to some extent, but the set of people with the motivation is different: people who want drugs, people who want to gamble, people who want to send money abroad with low fees, children who want to make online purchases but don't have internet banking.
The American govenment's hegemony is declining, and its moral authority is declining, and I just don't see it having much of a chance in this fight.

There are capital controls in Cyprus.  People are not allowed to take large quantities of euros off the island, and they get their euros confiscated if they try.  If a Cypriot has bitcoins, they could easily send them abroad, so bitcoins can play a role that euros no longer can on Cyprus, so bitcoins are potentially more valuable there than elsewhere.

I used localbitcoin.com once.  I thought it was pretty good.  They have a system where 1) the seller transfers the coins to a localbitcoin account, 2) localbitcoin tells the buyer a secret, 3) When the buyer and the seller are together, the seller sends a message to localbitcoins to transfer the money and in return local bitcoins then tells the seller the buyer's secret, 4) when the seller tells the buyer his secret, the buyer know it's safe to hand over the money.
There's still a moment when one party is up on the deal and can run away, but it's just a moment, and I think they've worked out a pretty good system.  It's free too.
I suppose the buyer could hand over the money before the seller does the transfer, then if the seller doesn't transfer, the buyer can raise a dispute with localbitcoins.  I don't see how they'd know what the truth was though unless you filmed it.

Maybe your company could even make its own virtual currency, tied to bitcoins that people could purchace and spend with merchants, send to friends as vouchers or cash-out/cash-in to bitcoins.

The problem with the VAT thing is obviously daft, and I guess the position would get changed if there was a court case.  The problem is that no one wants to risk starting a business on the basis that they would probably win a court case against the inland revenue.

Since I am a perfectionist, I am not happy with this sentance: 'Escrow transaction is a way to lock up some coins so a third party has to agree in order to spend them.' because it is incorrect: the third party does not need to agree in all cases.

One way to look at it is the people who put limit orders into an exchange are the ones providing stability and the people directly buying or selling at the current price are creating volitility.
I can't really understand why someone would be prepared to put in limit orders because I think the market price encodes information that I don't have, and that the market's short-term wisdom is better than mine.  The people with limit orders benefit from the spread I suppose, but for me that wouldn't make up for the fact that unless they are monitoring things constantly, they are exposed to the effects of events on the price.  Anyway, these people provide the stability in the market, which adds to the value of bitcoin and I'm grateful to them.  (I don't include people who put limit orders in with the purpose of fakeing out the market, and then remove them when the price gets close to their orders).

If you picked this sequence at random, its probability based on a 10 minute mean time between blocks is about 2/1000.  If you searched for a convincing streak in a longer set of data, the conditional probability is likely to be much higher.  Either way, it's very very unlikely that this short-term greater than three fold increase in the block discovery rate is due to a three fold increase in the hash power, or anything like it.

Yes.  Coins you don't control are not your coins.  There have been many online wallets that have run away with people's coins, or had them stolen.
The easiest way to get control of the coins yourself is probably to
1) install a [wallet]( on a computer,
2) encrypt it
3) back it up
4) turn off java in your browser
5) send the coins from coinbase to your computer wallet
If the ordering of 1),2),3) and 5) seems strange, you probably don't understand bitcoin addresses, private keys and what wallets store, and you should research them.
If you have a lot of coins that you intend to store for a long time, it's worth investigating [paper wallets](
@_date: 2013-09-06 11:46:50
The original intention was for each bitcoin address to be spent from only once, so even if the NSA can break the ECDSA, they couldn't have stolen any coins.  It's our slack habits of reusing addresses for convenience that has left us vulnerable to forged digital signatures.  So it's unlikely that Satoshi deliberately used a weak elliptic curve to introduce a vulnerablity.
Also, the NSA would probably be interested in tracing bitcoin transactions, which cracking the ECDSA doesn't help with.  Potentially, they could use such a weakness to steal some coins, but bitcoins would become worthless as soon as it because clear that someone could steal bitcoins.

The problem with using an escrow service for BFL pre-orders is that they were using the pre-order funds for development.  BFL weren't hiding this, and it's not in itself illegitimate.  For example the seemingly honest  are doing the same thing.
Paypal and the CC companies have more leverage than a normal escrow service, but I'm not sure why.  Maybe they control a larger proportion of BFL's funds, or more credibly threaten legal action.

If I had to guess, I'd say that the intention was to have a present tense sentence, but you seem to be implying that you'd guess a past tense sentence.
For a present tense sentence, the 'had' seems natural to me because the subclause is past tense (it's about when the photograph was taken).  I don't understand your point about the emphasising the 'So'.  I think it's just intensifying it, which could apply equally in the past or present tense.

You're welcome.  If you want to move the bitcoin to your own computer and you are using bitcoin-qt, then you'll have to wait for it to sync before you can control the coin.  You might get fed up of waiting for bitcoinqt to download the blockchain though, and there are alternatives that don't download it such as  or  or you could get a wallet for your phone.
The advantage of bitcoin-qt is that you are helping to support the bitcoin network when you run it, but there's no direct advantage to you really.

Transferwise used to be used heavily by UK bitcoin buyers to buy from bitstamp, but several months ago they sent out a message that they would no longer allow transfers to bitstamp.  I don't suppose they care where their transfers go to, so I suspect they were told to stop by a regulatory body or by their bank.

It's very unlikely for a consumer to make any money mining, and lots of people have lost out compared to just buying bitcoins.  One problem is that the generating power of a miner halves about every two weeks, so they have a very short lifetime.  That means that during shipping the value of a miner depreciates significantly.  The manufacturer will not swallow that cost because he could just run the machines himself, so the consumer has to pay it.
Most people new to mining seem to get the idea that mining would be a good idea, but really it's not, except in so far as it's interesting and supports the network.

Bitcoin must be like cryptonite to a compliance officer.  They've got the banks pinned down, so currently if money is sent online they know who it comes from and who it's going to.  Once someone has bitcoin, they can send it to whoever they like.  There is no expectation of the government knowing who either party is, or even what county they're in.  It's saying you may as well give up all that AML/KYC crap that you've invested the last three years of your life in because it's as relevent as the pre-internet rules on pornography.  He sounds like a bright guy that has put two and two together but is not ready to accept that the rules he has been taught are toast.

I agree the proof-of-work scheme for establishing a unique block-chain is not ideal in the sense that it requires lots of computational effort, but it is the only distributed solution we know of (I believe).
Implying that this computational power could be used to benefit humanity instead is a bit of a falicy in my opinion.  It's like saying that the immense expense of mining gold could be used to benefit humanity, or the money that goes to the defence industry.  Ultimately human society has fewer degrees of freedom than it might naively appear.  You can't just redirect effort from something that appears pointless or harmful to something that appears beneficial, and when people try too hard to force that, you get The Great Leap Forward.

The problem with that suggestion is that mining is not really the verification process.  Although miners have to verify that transactions have been signed etc., nodes also have to verify the transactions in the mined block.  Although telling people a convincing sounding story might work well in the short term, I don't think it's good policy.
Bitcoin is a new thing, and the unfortunate truth is that people will have to do some thinking in order to understand it.
What miners are actually doing is verifyable computationally expensive calculations.  The purpose of this is to make it computationally infeasible, or at least uneconomic, for someone to retrospectively modify the ledger of transactions.

Interesting idea.  I don't think FRB is too bad if the people who loan their money to the banks understand that that is what they are doing, and get paid a reasonable interest rate.  With bitcoin, it's quite easy to do your own banking, and so the consumer banks might have to pay decent interest to get people to deposit.  Also, with bitcoin, the banks really would need the depositors because the government/central bank is not going to be able to just add numbers to the consumer bank's reserve.

Please could someone explain to me why google authenticator (or anyone else) uses a MAC (message authentication code) rather than a public key cryptography digital signature (as bitcoin does).
With a MAC, both the message creater and the message verifyer need to know the secret key, which means that an attacker with read access to the verifyer's data can forge messages.  This attack vector doesn't exist for the public key version.

* receives 'money' for transmission, or transmits money, or

@_date: 2013-08-28 14:58:37
But currently, the further back you mine from, the more block rewards you can swallow.  I don't think higher fees compared to block rewards change the incentives to re-mine blocks.
The exception is if recent fees have been so large that it's worth gambling on the small chance of getting your usurper chain accepted at the cost of the fees and rewards that you'd expect from honest mining instead.
[edit] I thought I'd add in a calculation.  Since the reward on this block compared to a normal block was about (200+12.5)/12.5 = 17, and the chance for a miner controling a proportion p of the hash power mining two blocks before anyone else mines 1 is p^2, dishonesty would have had an expected positive payoff in this instance for a miner controlling more than sqrt(1/17) ~= 1/4 of the hash power.

This sounds like a really good idea to me.  I think the main problem with bitcoins at the moment is completing the loop.  I don't get paid in bitcoins, it's a real pain for me to buy and sell bitcoins and no one I want to buy things from takes bitcoins.  
When bitcoin to cash conversion gets easier it exponentially boosts the usefulness of bitcoins.
In the Philippines they're mad on mobile phones.  They can send 'load' to each other's phones and people have little businesses selling load.  Load has got 90% of the way to being a currency but somehow hasn't quite made it.  I suppose cash is just too easy.  Although businesses could accept load to pay for items, they'd then need to set-up sidelines selling load, which would be a bigger overhead than taking money to the bank.

I'm sure this is naive, but in the simplist case, you could just publish a public address for people to send bitcoins to.  That has the issue that you won't know who sent what, and that you shouldn't spend from the same address twice.
The next level of sophistication would be an address shown to people when they make an order that is unique to that order.  Just look in the address at  to see if the money has arrived.
A downside to bitcoins that you should be aware of is that if someone sends to the wrong address by mistake, that money is gone.

I don't understand this comment (I don't know much about quark coin).  With bitcoin, Satoshi disappeared and bitcoin is fine.  The bitcoin protocol and the reference client are public domain and anyone can maintain them, so bitcoin doesn't rely on the continued presence of Satoshi.  Why does quarkcoin rely on the continued presence of Kolin and Max?
I have an issue with altcoins.  Anyone can clone a crypto currency (as long as its code is public domain, which I see as a necessity), so there is no scarcity for crypto currencies unless there is some criterion users can use to rule out all but a few of them.  Of course scarcity is a necessity for currency.
Candidate criteria are
* being the first coin to offer some feature or
* being more accepted by merchants or
* having superior infrastructure.
I don't see getting hyped by a famous person as a good criterion for scarcity because there are lots of famous people, and each famous person could hype lots of coins over time.  For the first-with-feature criterion, the feature would have to be a significant improvement: more than over-over engineering bitcoin's already over engineered cryptography, or speeding up bitcoin's supposedly slow confirmation time.
Thus I see bitcoin as currently the clear winner amongst current coins since it has a much wider merchant adoption, much better infrastructure even than litecoin and also was the first coin of all.  Litecoin comes second, in my opinion mainly because it satisfies the criterion of being the first coin to offer the feature of not being bitcoin.  This is a pretty poor criterion, and I don't expect litecoin to maintain its current relative value to bitcoin.
The other coins seem to me as though someone tweaked TCP/IP in a small way that made it incompatible with the original, and expected it to catch on.  As far as I can see the only thing motivating altcoin adoption is greed, which I admit is a big part of the motivation for bitcoin adoption, but is not the whole of it.  Without the underlying usefulness (of bitcoin, not the alts) what you are left with is a pyramid scheme, and pyramid schemes collapse.
It may be that some future coin with new technology has a good enough new feature to let it compete successfully with bitcoin.  In that case, I imagine it would eventually replace bitcoin because of network effects unless bitcoin could adopt the new technology too.  Zerocoin might have such a feature.  I speculate that zerocoin might be made illegal if it's significantly harder for the NSA to analyse the transaction graph, and there might be room in the world for a legal cryptocurrency and an illegal one.
I wonder about what would happen if there was a technical innovation that allowed a coin to be created without the need for mining.  The lower costs of such a coin might make it more appealling than bitcoin (lower transaction costs and no monetary inflation), and it could take over I think.

What you should do (in my opinion) is generate some largish number of addresses securely, print off the keys (at least two copies), and save the addresses to a text file.  Then do an experiment with 0.0001 btc moving it to the first address, and checking that you can recover it from the printout.
If you can, you can be a lot more confident that you'll be able to recover from the other addresses in the text file.

If you're looking at a transaction you sent, then all addresses in the from fields will be controlled by the wallet you sent from.

I have some questions for you.
Are you proposing that the cashier should treat the payment as made after 0 confirmations?
Could there be a way for the buyer to input the seller's address using a keypad while he's waiting in the queue?
Is your proposal secured against a rogue cashier or third party somehow inserting their own address to be scanned?
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:12:36
I think the best way would be to use the major exchanges in proportion to the slope of their offer curves.  You also need to think about whether to buy all the coins at the same time, or trickle the money in.
I suspect most people disagree with this, but I think there's a lot to be said for buying all at the same time.  That is, look at where on the bid-wall your purchase will climb to, and put in a single huge bid in which the price you offer is that price, and the number of coins you bid for is the number of coins your money would buy at that price (you should actually get them cheaper, so you should have some cash left that you could use for further buying if you want).
The reason I think this is a good strategy is that if the market sees money trickling in, it will jump ahead of you and raise prices to take advantage of that trickle.
If you are going to use multiple exchanges, you should trade on them as close together as possible, in decreasing size order, to minimise the amount arbitragers take from you.
There is a good argument for spreading out your trades though: cost averaging.  If you spend $500k when the price is $100, and $500k when the price is $200, you will end up with 5000 + 2500 = 7500 coins at an average price of $1M/7500 = $133.  Better than the $150: the average of $100 and $200, that you might naively think.
Because of this phenomenon, people recommend that you should 'average in', ie spread your buys out over a period of time.  This effect gets larger if there are large price movements (in proportion to the price) while you are buying.
If you bought all at once, you'd probably move the market by $10 or so, and pay on average half of that movement.  ie if the price when you bought was $100, you'd move it to $110, and pay on average $105.  If we posit that you'd have the same effect on the price if you trickled your money in, but that it would move before you made most of your purchase, you'd pay $110, and the trickle strategy would cost you ~5% = $50k.
This loss needs to be compared to the gain you'd get from the cost-averaging effect, which depends on the volitility of the market, and the amount of time you're prepared to take to get into it.  In the example I gave, the gain you'd get from averaging in is to pay $133 instead of $150 (if this maths seems odd, remember the price doubling could as easily have been a halving), which is a ratio of 8:9, or a little bigger than the 5% loss.  On the other hand, a price doubling or halving in bitcoin will take maybe a year (your guess might vary), and you might not want to wait that long in case bitcoin takes off.
If you do decide to do some cost averaging, I'd go for maximum unpredictability, which I think would mean, spend about half now in one purchase (or one on each exchange), then wait for as much time as you dare, and spend the rest, again as quickly as you can.  If you buy exactly half now, someone might see the $500k and this reply, and work out what's happening, which would let them benefit at your expense.
[Edit] You'd also want to take into account the price differences between the exchanges when you decided how to divide up your purchase.  Also I've looked more closely at the limit orders on gox  and I think you'd only move the price by $5 or so.  Hardly worth worrying about :).

If you are succesful, and I really hope that you are, then it seems likely that in a future 'bail in' event, the government will want to include your depositors.  Have you given any thought to the possibility of enabling depositors to withdraw their coins without your cooperation (in the event that you are prevented from cooperating).  Clearly most customers won't have the skills to use bitcoins directly themselves, but if they had the necessary keys, they could get independent expert help themselves.  It probably wouldn't be safe to give customers their secret keys, but perhaps the key information could be split between the customer and a trusted third party outside of the EU, with the understanding that the third party won't act without government seizure attempts.
A second issue is that I was a bit skeptical about your idea of hedging btc/euro exchange rate risk.  I suspect the only instruments that would be sensible to use for this are euros and bitcoins themselves.  In other words, you would hold bitcoins and euros for each customer in a ratio of their choosing.

I'll propose a simplistic model containing just miners and bitcoin investors.  The miners mine at a constant rate and immediately sell the coins they mine. The investors invest at a constant $/day rate.  In this model, the btc/$ price would stabilise at the value that made the miner's earnings rate equal to investers savings rate.  (To be strict, you'd probably need a market maker in the model to provide short-term liquidity).
For what it's worth, if this model were correct, investors would be investing at about 400,000 $/day.

Two reasons.  The first is privacy, from governments and other people.  Privacy in bitcoin comes through not knowing who controls which address, because the transactions between addresses are completely public.  Clearly this privicy is not perfect because anyone who sends you bitcoin knows which address they sent it to.  Also people that receive bitcoin from you can see which address it came from.  The more different addresses you use to receive coins, the less of your business nosey people can deduce.
The second reason is security.  When coin is spent from an address, the *public key* for that address is published on the blockchain.  For an elementary understanding of bitcoin, you only need to know about private keys and addresses: the public key occurs behind the scenes and is related to both of these.  Theoretically speaking, it is easier to recover the private key from the public key than from the address: you'd 'only' need to break the ECDSA rather than having to break both ECDSA and SHA256.  Theoretically ECDSA is more vulnerable to an attack by a quantum computer for example.  Successful cryptographic attacks against the bitcoin protocol are currently pretty far fetched, but if you have a lot of money stored in bitcoin, it's worth being as secure as possible.

I've been thinking about this too.  Someone could set up a system like an onine bank account but for bitcoins instead of cash, that protects the users from accidentally cocking up (trojans, typos etc.) and allows charge-backs, and maybe overdraughts.  Of course chargebacks would only work if they stopped you from sending coins to an account not managed in such a way.  The obvious question then is what would be the advantage of such an account compared to a cash account.
Maybe they could also allow irreversible transactions to outside the system, analogously to banker's draughts or ATM machine withdrawals.  These dangerous transactions could have warnings attached in the hope that users would blame themselves if they made a mistake in the same way that they do if they lose bank notes.
If such accounts become commonplace, merchants might offer discounts for irrerversible payments.  Satoshi said of the mainstream financial system


avoid mediating disputes.
but I'm not sure why they can't.  Perhaps ultimately the courts would force them to reverse payments from stolen accounts, or to businesses that don't deliver the product.  Of course this is often a valuable service, but it would be nice to have the option to be paid to not use the safety net.  I suppose the problems with this is that lots of people aren't good at judging who is trustworthy, and that even the seemingly trustworthy may not be.  It's a trade off between allowing people freedom and protecting them from themselves: like drug law.
Perhaps if a small company did this instead of a bank they could avoid the regulators, temporarily at least, by being off-shore and/or small, like the bitcoin gambling sites, but for a small company the infra-structure: cards and card readers for identity verification, might be difficult.

I don't think this is right.  Assuming you're buying:
* lbc will tell you when the seller has deposited the coin into lbc's control, and will send you the 'verify code'.
* Then you meet the seller (somewhere public is good).
* Seller sends an SMS to lbc, which releases the coins into your lbc wallet, in return lbc sends seller the 'verify code'
* Seller tells you the verify code (so you know that the coins are in your lbc wallet) and you give seller the cash
You could give the cash to the seller before the seller sends the SMS.  Someone has to handover first, and that person has the risk that the other guy will run off.
If the seller doesn't have a mobile, he can tell you the release code, and you can send the SMS instead of him.
It seems complicated until you've done it.  I recommend starting with a small transaction
[Edit] to answer your questions.  1) No that's not the right app.  The buyer doesn't normally need a phone even, but if the seller doesn't have one, the buyer must have. 2) You know immediately because the seller will tell you the verify code.

There's a theory that some institutions are selling gold short: that is, claiming that they are holding gold for people when they aren't.  Most gold holders do not have an immediate use for their gold, and could make an arbitrage profit from the backwardation, so the fact that the backwardation exists suggests that gold holders don't trust the sellers of gold futures.

Thanks very much.  That does make sense.  You can divide time into lots of short periods, and consider those periods as independent bets that you could make.  Dollar cost averaging means betting more on the later periods, which is arbitrary: seems more natural to roughly bet the same on each period by putting all the money you want to invest in at the beginning.

If you use altavista to search, it doesn't improve my altavista search experience.  Even now, if bing overtook google in terms of search matches, it could become the most popular search engine.  By constrast, every time someone posts something on reddit say, tcp/ip becomes a little bit more useful.

I think most want to understand how it happened.  Most people that have been into bitcoin for any time feel ambivalent at best about Mt Gox.  This kind of theft has happened a lot.  Mt Gox should sort itself out, but it hasn't.  People shouldn't leave their bitcoins on an exchange unless they're actively trading them.  People should be sweating whenever their bitcoins are in someone else's wallet.

This is a bit similar to the bitbargain.co.uk site (which is for the uk only), but there are some interesting differences.
BB only presents buyers with sellers who are currently online, which eliminates waits of an uncertain duration.
BB lets sellers determine the price.  Typically the BB price is maybe 10% above gox (though there is a lot of variation, and sometimes it is below).  This reflects the risks, delays and difficulties involved in sending sterling from the UK to an international exchange, and other risks the sellers have.
The UK market is not directly connected to Gox, and bitcoin-broker effectively has price controls to set the price to gox+2%.  I think it's likely that few UK sellers will use bitcoin-brokers because they will usually be able to get a better price elsewhere.

 Bitcoin is a powerful tool for avoiding government control, but unfortunately, not all government control is bad.

@_date: 2013-07-21 10:05:07
This isn't what you asked for, but I have a couple of observations of problems users have with bitcoins that it might be possible to mitigate with a clever UI.
The first is a confusion between addresses and wallets and coins.  It seems to be natural for people to think that when they back up their wallet, that they are saving their coins to disk.  Thus they will back-up after they have received some coins rather than before, or they'll think that they are safe after they've encrypted their wallet, even if an unencrypted version still exists.  Importing private addresses into a wallet also has dangers.
The second observation I have is that people have difficulty using digits to represent quantity, particularly in an unfamiliar currency.  Thus they sometimes get confused between 0.001 btc and 0.01 btc for example.  Also, it's easy for them to just click 'ok' without thinking, if they have done it many times before, so it shouldn't be possible to spend coins just by clicking ok: maybe they should have to drag a visual representation of the coins (with some clue of their magnitude) to a representation of the recipient.  I don't know!  You're the designer.  These are just problems I've noticed with current UIs.

It's really strange.  He's bright enough to put together a grammatical, coherent article, but he can't seem to generalise or see patterns.  He recognises that bitcoin is useful for drug traders and for rich Chinese people to circumvent capital controls, but he seems to think, or at least he implies, that if the Chinese liberalise their captial controls then bitcoin value will never recover.
He's a bit like someone who, at the start of the distribution of electricity to homes, noticed that electrical lights were less reliable than gas, and that electricity-based heath treatments were dubious, and deduced that electricity was a fad.  Except the potential is more obvious with bitcoin I think.  Does he not pause for thought when he sees its diverse uses?  Does he not wonder whether maybe the bitcoin economy hasn't yet finished developing, and that the more applications bitcoin has the more other applications are enabled?  Really strange.

I don't buy this.  I think it's a good approximation to use the usual supply and demand curves to model the bitcoin market, and the price is where they intersect.  If someone tries to deliberately move the price, they have to either buy coins or find a way to short them, and to move the price significantly they'd have to buy or sell a significant proportion of the coins in existence, which I don't believe is realistic.
Sure traders get up to some market faking antics on the exchanges, but I don't believe that these can move the price more than a few percent.

I don't believe a using a service such as Coinbase to hold your private keys is secure at the moment.  I've got no idea about the honesty and competence of the operators of Coinbase, but there are also other risks such as regulatory action, or even criminal extortion.
My own advice is to
* Have a wallet on your own computer.
* Encrypt it with a good unique password.
* Keep regular backups of the wallet.
* Turn off Java in your browser.
If you want to hold a lot of coins in the long term then investigate [paper wallets]( but test that you can retrieve coins from a paper wallet before you start using them to store a lot.

Exchanges tend to centralise, at least for each exchanged-item pair.  Bitcoin is particularly prone to this because it's so easy to move.  The reason is that the big traders have to trade in the same exchange to get the market liquidity they need.

To me the fact that alternative methods (eg localbitcoins.com) to acquire bitcoins exist seems to matter.  People use the banking system because it is the cheapest and most convenient way.  However, just because they currently use the banking system doesn't mean that they'll stop acquiring bitcoins if the banking system route shuts down.

So you would need to send the coins from your bitbargain wallet to another wallet you control, for example you blockchain wallet.
You shouldn't be remembering the wallet code.  Just log into the wallet when you want to receive, and you can copy (ctrl-c) the code from there.

They can show the transaction and they can prove that they control the originating address.  However, they can't prove that they don't control the receiving address.

Why do you say to use an address you can sign with?  I used a cold wallet address as that's where I'd like my dividends to be paid, but to sign with it would be a pain and compromise its security, so if I'm going to have to sign with the address I'd rather use one from my qt client.  Is it written somewhere that we'll have to sign with the address or is that speculation?  Thanks.

Wallets typically contain many addresses.  Usually some of them can be seen in the 'Receive' tab of the wallet and there is an option there to generate new (additional) addresses for the wallet.  As far as is possible, when you receive bitcoins into your wallet, you should receive them into a new address.
Paper wallets however, are just pieces of paper with a private key written on.  Also, just to be confusing, some people use the term 'wallet' to mean a private key and the corresponding public address.

I think when you hit paper wallet, it generated a new paper wallet for you that you could print out.  That wallet would be unconnected to your main blockchain wallet I guess unless you either added the address to watch it, or imported the private key to spend from it.

BitcoinQT is fine as a client in my opinion, and running it does help to support the network.  The biggest issue with it is the time it takes initially to download the blockchain, but it sounds as though you've already overcome that hurdle.
If you continue using it, be sure to encrypt the wallet and back it up.  Counter intuitively, you can back up before you put coins in the wallet rather than afterwards.  This is because you are actually backing up the secret keys for the addresses that the coins will go in rather than the coins themselves.  The wallet silently generates new addresses as you use it, so every 100 transactions, you should back it up again.

I'm not sure this is true.  If you had a stick as well as a carrot, then maybe, but with just carrots, a lot of people's lives are ok, and can only be improved a finite amount by money.  Bigger house, faster car, whatever, might not be enough to make someone break his principles.

I'm a maths guy.  I think it's cool that primecoin miners are finding prime numbers, but does primecoin add anything from a currency user's perspective?

I was thinking about this, and I think maybe you can use satoshi-dice for money laundering.  First split up the money into small wallets, and subject it to randomish transfer patterns similar to what it would see in the real world, then for each of the small wallets, take some long-odds bet (or sequence of bets).  This will kill some of the small wallets, but make others huge.  Each time gampble your smallest wallet.  Carry on until you only have one wallet left.  I suspect that wallet is now indistinguishable from that of a lucky punter who got a string of big wins on satoshi dice.
It's almost as through satoshi dice is set up for laundering.

trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-
reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party

Something to watch out for, I believe, is that the blockchain wallet reuses keys (my guess is that the QT wallet does not), which means that if someone else sees the private key, even after you've emptied it, your blockchain wallet is insecure.
My top tip is to practise restoring a small quantity of coins from a paper wallet before you save a large quantity of coins in a (different) paper wallet.  This precaution saved me from saving my coins in a wallet printed with a font that didn't distinguish between 'w' and 'W'.

The hope, in the long term, is that retailers will be able to give a discount for bitcoin purchases because they have much lower fees and no chargeback risks.  In other words, at the moment everyone is bearing the price for dishonest consumers and retailers.  With bitcoin, if consumers can recognise an honest retailer that price can be avoided and everyone can benefit.  This is actually the motivation given right at the beginning of bitcoin in the first paragraph of the [white paper](

At some point, I guess we'll hear about a wave of robberies.  There are trade offs for someone who has hacked computers: do you rob early and scare the horses, or leave it for longer until you have hacked more computers and risk being preempted?  Do you try to install key-loggers to get encrypted wallets, or do you just go for the low hanging fruits?
I'd be interested to know what percentage of wallets are encrypted.  I guess it will decrease if bitcoin gets a wider user base.
