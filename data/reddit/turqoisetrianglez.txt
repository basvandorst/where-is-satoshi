I think as a community we are overly busy circle jerking about how bad certain individuals are who challenge the credibility of bitcoin.
We should be the exact opposite, take his points and provide MEANINGFUL evidence as to why they do not matter. Ask yourself, have any of us so far in this thread done anything but insult, berate, and challenge the credibility of Krugman?
What kind of example are we setting to people who visit this subreddit? We are showing that we are a bunch of hate mongering people who would rather not discuss ACTUAL reasons bitcoin is a worthwhile investement.

I love bitcoin but does anybody else feel like at this current moment in time bitocoin is still a bit volatile to be used in these types of situations?
The exact thing that causes me to mention this is the holding time that some exchanges require before completing transfers.

Their opinions are important because deAWM is one of the leading investment companies in the world. These are people who credentially speaking are significanly more intelligent and have studied dramatically more economic theory than our subreddit together.
The points the article is making isn't necessarily that bitcoin is the worst investment in the world as the sensationalized title would have you believe. 
The point is that there are other places you can invest which will have upwards of 90% chance of growth and return...Things that are based on tangible services/assets

I don't think that they "don't believe in the revolution" as they believe in much safer investment opportunities.
bitcoin has the potential to change the world, but it additionally could fail. The propensity for it to fail is what keeps it from being a go to investment.

Was totally an oversight on my part, thanks for the catch!

All about risk assessment, as you said you don't expect many sales to be in bitcoin so you'll probably be just fine.

I love how you started that statement, but i feel like it would be taken a bit more seriously if we didn't make such sweeping and broad statements about inflation. 
Besides we all saw a week ago by one huge mtgox "error" that this system could possibly be/is already controlled by several huge holders.
