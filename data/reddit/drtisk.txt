I like the way his brain works fuckbackwards when he invested 50,000, he ended up with 100,000 but the ATH was 140,000 and he actually thinks he lost 40,000.

People were FUDing all about that in the rise all the way up to 20k. Although it was a factor, I think the BCH fiasco is the straw that broke the camel's back.

I just don't think pokemon is a good way of demonstrating the power of the lightning network

Isn't this just an overcomplicated version of twitch plays pokemon? I like crypto as a tech but using it for janky shit like this seems like such a gimmick (and also someone is making money off anyone donating sats)

Why would anyone use a forum you have to pay to post? There's a reason facebook, reddit, twitter etc are free. There's legitimate reasons to use crypto where it offers real advantages, playing pokemon and posting on forums aren't those reasons

It's a huge advantage for stuff like supply chain, and I hope that some teams can put it into practice and  capitalise on it. 
But the average joe still thinks Bitcoin is a magic anonymous black market currency that can't be tracked. But then again, all crypto is "the Bitcoin" to them, similar to how all videogames are Nintendo
