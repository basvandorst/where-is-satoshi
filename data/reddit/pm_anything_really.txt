This is definitely one of those misleading shitposts that destroy genuine credibility.  
This is exactly how crypto was designed to work and you just don't get it.

I've never understood this theory because it doesn't make sense.
Why would creating an input on an address help to track a user?  The bitcoin ledger is public, so you can accomplish the same without sending anything at all.
Edit:  I always thought of it as bitcoin panhandling.  Sometimes blockchain.info will show messages begging or advertising a service

As someone who runs 2 full nodes (one with tx-index), I can assure you that blockchain size isn't even an issue for me.  If I needed to, I'd get larger hard drives without even blinking.  
SW is destroying the idea of a full distributed ledger, as I understand it, which is a fundamental reason I even run the nodes to begin with.  It will not be any easier to run a node after SW is actually utilized.
Do you see the predicament I'm in here?

It makes good sense to hang on to both.  If y'all could predict the future you wouldn't be spreading FUD on Reddit.  You'd be on a beach somewhere DGAFfing all day.

Thanks for that explanation.  I assume the deposit and withdraw transactions will still need to make a transaction on the blockchain, for each channel.  That explains why another supporter said fees will still rise even with SW.  This still feels really bad.  
If I open a channel with an exchange, I need to deposit a large amount to deposit multiple small amounts and another transaction to withdraw and spend the coins in another channel?

Yes to the second layer thing.  I'm not totally understanding of how the technicals work, but the rhetoric from SW proponents on reddit has me concerned.  For example, someone said that "coffee transactions shouldn't be included in the global ledger" for scalability reasons.  I couldn't disagree more.

Gfy, others did help me understand and while they don't seem to realize my concerns are on a protocol level (not end user), I think I was pretty close.

...and that about sums up the Reddit case against hard forking over a controversial protocol change.
