If you have visual studio or any other c# dev environment this might work:

How that? I've purchased it a few hours ago and I am pretty sure it was just added normally to my library

Honest question: 
My understanding until now was that Segwit2x was a compromise to get the miners to agree to the segwit activation while at the same time agreeing to a moderate blocksize increasement (compared to the suggested 8MB size).
The outcome was that segwit was activated and everyone around here was happy and celebrating. Now it "suddenly" seems to be consensus around here that the other end of the bargain will not be kept.
What am I missing?

This is the first time i've heard of vertical farming in a desert. To be hinest I think I only read about vertical farming once in some blog post but it really sounds interesting.
Would you mind sharing pictures?

Also if you have the technical knowledge and a larger amount of spare bandwidth to share on a dedicated server or VPS be sure to setup a tor relay to help the tor network grow.  
Running a non-exit relay does not expose your severs IP to any website because you will only relay traffic inside the tor network so you do not risk any legal issues.

This is huge!  
  
In fact, what YOU do is huge Jason and never fails to amaze me.  
I donated quite some time ago, when it was like "1BTC for 40 meals". And while I look back quite often to the times where bitcoin was valued significant lower and I used it to buy stuff or cash out and think "I just should have hold the coins" I never regret this donation back then.  
  
I hope you get the possibility and the fundings to keep doing what you are doing for a long time!

Great idea and great music (did't know you before), thanks for participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem!  
Even though all your albums are on spotify this is something that deserves support - so I need to buy an "all almbums"-package! :)  
  
Unfortunately coinbase seems to have some issues as it is spitting out a monstrosity of QR-Code (well, not even close to an QR code actually) but manually entering the address worked

This is such a great idea. Faith in humanity: restored. Have a coin!

I want to believe... do you have any possibility to provide proof?

I'd throw in the term "network architect" because I guess thats more accurate. 
"software developers" sounds more like Bitcoin would simply be a program worked on by several devs. People could get the impression that these developers have the power to change Bitcoin to whatever they want. But that is not the case. Bitcoin is a general idea realized through a complex protocol and every protocol change has to be accepted by the community.
So I guess the termin "network architect" or "protocol architect" would be quite fitting

Looking at blockchain.info I cannot even see your transaction which means that it was not even broadcasted to the network.
Normally you'd see the transcation as soon as it is sent to the network (what takes time are the confirmations).
Apart from that, the "bounty" would be the transaction fee - the higher the TX fee is the more likly it is that your TX will be included in the next block - but in this case of course this does not help. 
So this seems to be an issue with mtgox, maybe your TX got stuck somewhere - just contact support and they'll figue it out

C'mon guys. Op updated the album with verification. Some kid holding up a QR-Code on TV gets tipped 50 grand but only very view people are willing to share when help really could be needed? - That would be just sad.

It happens to be the case that a lot of my daily business revolves around BE supporting/troubleshooting (no, I am not working at Symantec).
Yes, 2012 changed a lot in terms of configuration and the user interface and it also came with a lot of teething problems. And also Symantec support can be (will be) a pain to deal with.
However, let me give two advices:
* get SP2 installed, it fixes ALOT
* if you have a larger installation (backing up more than just a handful servers) try to find a symantec partner which offers to handle 1st/2nd level support calls for BE. You should not encounter any outsourced call centers and most of the cases will be solved much easier. Have a look at the partner locator to get an idea which company is qualified. This ofc will come at a price in most cases.

Thanks for letting us know. I've worked with Filezilla for the past few years and if I recall the old times where some shareware crap ftp client was the tool of choice I think its just fair to to spare a few $

There was a post mentioned somewhere that special agreements exist with high frequency traders which include custom fees to make HFT profitable. Please clarify if this is the truth and, if yes, if you plan to keep it that way.

Thanks for this comboy!   
Regarding the exchanges: I agree that it would be favourable that the exchanges themselves switch to mBTC too but you have to keep in mind that it is relatively easy to switch a statistics page but it might be huge task to switch an exchange.  
Everything starting from the GUI and going to the business logic and the matching algorithms and the database require significant changes and there is a LOT that can go wrong there.  
  
Sure there are tests for that but a little risk always remains. And just think what even a small mistake could mean: Somebody gains or looses 1000 times the amount he wanted to trade etc..  
  
So it is a very complex situation and I can understand that exchanges are not too keen to switch.  
  
The best apporach would be that all exchanges agree on a date to switch (maybe 01.03.2014 - then they start coding the changes and let a public exchange on the testnet run starting from 15.01.2014 so the community can help to test everything thoroughly for bugs/cavecats
