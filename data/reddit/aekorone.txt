What a glorious day
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:47:20
I don't trust this guy at all
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:45:49
Why would anyone want to use a robocoin ATM compared to this?
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:13:34
Still have my high school freshman letter. Actually I just found it the other day and was reading it. All it mentioned was smoking weed and skateboarding haha
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:36:01

I'm almost positive this is u/Kurdish-Nationalist. He posted the same thing already 
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:29:09
Thank you. Now I'm gonna tip someone :)
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:24:03
Hell yeah
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:18:28
My mom works for AMEX and one of her old bosses is interviewing with second market. I was so happy because now my mom is starting to understand my bitcoin obsession :)
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:08:53
Luckily I don't see my name or email. I haven't been getting any emails either. I guess I'll wait to see if a complete list comes out later
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:32:18
Did you add a fee?
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:13:41
Oh shit another pastebin link. It must be legit.

Perhaps I am confused. Let me see if I have this right. You said you were able to log back into your locked account without 2FA on March 1st. Couldn't you have re-enabled it then? Your coins went missing the very next day correct? It sounds like the 2FA not being re-enabled was the issue? 
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:03:01
Down for me too bud
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:16:37
I hope I'm not too late! Here's a link to a tip I made 
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:40:41
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:03:55
Why would anyone want to buy that garbage? 
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:38:41
Not sure if I'm too late but thanks anyways :)

My birthday was at the end of March. Get back to me next year on the 29th of March and I'll return the favor 
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:32:29
Most "geeks" don't know shit about bitcoin. I've gone to a few anime/comic conventions and more than 90% of the sellers had no clue what bitcoin was. These places are full of geeks! This is the Phoenix area BTW.
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:38:59
I'm a supporter of bitcoin but I have to admit this made me laugh
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:21:23
Thanks. I never thought I would be on the receiving end of penis
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:06:36
Just curious why was .1 BTC sent to this address from Dorian's?
@_date: 2014-05-16 22:04:09
That's awesome. If I had the money I would pull the trigger too. Best of luck
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:32:04
Never had any info or money on Gox, but fuck this guy. Please somebody find out who he is 
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:59:53
21 now. Go to work, school, help my brother build his 240z, read, draw, and hang out with my girlfriend. That's about it.
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:58:40
What the hell does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:05:28
Cool thanks 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:18:46
Why don't you go stand outside a casino and pay all of the losers out of your own pocket
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:42:10
No way?! Dude thank you so much 
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:35:27
Am I too late to join the party?
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:57:07
That's what I figured. Thanks for the reply 
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:15:12
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:19:50
Dude you rule. Maybe I'll be joining you sooner than I thought :)

I'm not sure if this is inside the stadium, but at 2:50 this guy purchases an item with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:15:04
Bad reputation? Source?
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:24:00
Why didn't you re-enable 2FA?
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:59:05
Maybe it's because most people here in the US are sleeping? 
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:07:09
Coinbase if you're in the US
