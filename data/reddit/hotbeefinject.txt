No need for your relative to ever touch BTC or a computer, only a phone to talk to you.

As the merchant, I'd probably want branding of the storefront &amp; register Bitcoin decals with whatever the POS conversion source is, so the customer knows to switch their app's source to match, or be prepared to see a slightly different BTC price on the POS than what they saw after scanning the pricetag. 
It's really academic anyway, as how often do people buy just one item at a store? The POS will need to scan in multiple items, total them, add taxes=theft... the customer's QR pricetag scan is mainly to preload the payment address if the store reuses them &amp; get an idea of about how much BTC it's currently worth without having to manually input numbers. 
Is there even a bitcoin mobile app that allows for scanning multiple QR codes and summing the amounts if they are all to the same address?
Though I guess if only one tax-free item needs to be checked out, the cashier could just let them scan, pay, and wave them out once confirmed.

I wouldn't say every bank has at least one security guard, unless the guards are sitting in CCTV rooms without windows. Even the unarmed guards I've seen tend to stand outside banks, and would only really risk getting hurt if they happened to come inside. When armed men are minutes away, even the stupidest criminal usually evades prosecution, despite being captured on CCTV (because it almost never gets a clear shot of faces or tattoos unless it's eye level, 10 feet away at most, and the perp is standing still facing the lens.)

And finally, "gun control" non-profits are in there, probably the worst offenders of having fancy dress parties ad nauseam and having their cronies in government pass laws violating civil rights ("gun control") so their alleged constituents suffer worse and worse violent crime rates, which enables the cycle of "justifying" even more civil rights violations, more donations, more profiting from pain, benefiting only criminals' safety.

And yet we see pictures of fancy dress party after fancy dress party coughbenefitgalacough instead of these very same people working to actually benefit almost anyone the non-profits are chartered to support, and the crime and poverty rate there gets worse and worse, being compared to Afghanistan? 
It's like this in every fucking dystopian major metro area (utopias of "gun control" advocates like NYC, LA, Oakland, where you only get a permit for self-defense if you can afford to pay legal bribes, which is racist and classist as fuck) if you look through that site. Tens, hundreds of billions of dollars, hardly any of it actually benefiting anyone but the scam non-profit runners, their family, friends, and cronies themselves. Decent non-profits are far and few between.
If all this money (or even most of it, leaving a fair and small percentage for admin) were going to good use, NOBODY would be homeless, NOBODY would be living in slums in these counties, NOBODY would be living in anything but a sufficiently sized and non-hazardous home, NOBODY would be on food stamps, NOBODY would feel the need to join/start a gang, NOBODY would feel they have no choice but to be a criminal to be able to be safer than legally disarmed and defenseless law-abiding gun control victims, NOBODY would be dealing drugs because nobody would be abusing them... 
And if you think the government spends too much now? It's a drop in the bucket compared to the scam non-profits, which the government even gives grants to, even if they don't need them in the least, because they're corrupt as shit, quid pro quo, bastards, profiting from all our PAIN.

Sure, if your bank has an armed guard or two. Many if not most just have an unarmed "cannon fodder" guard.

It's not a threat. Every totalitarian state is in a cold civil war with its citizens, and the citizens are losing.

And I agree about omitting your goods. Even if you literally looked up the best selling thing on Amazon, bought up a ton of it at bulk price, and discounted it double digit percentage from retail fiat, people still won't buy that shit with BTC.

I read the study, and it only was directed at firearm killings, not all mass killings. Again making "gun crime" equal to "crime".
Thanks for proving your ignorant act once again.
Dying in an arson fire is not morally superior to everyone there being able to shoot the arsonist in self-defense. And don't pretend default non-tracer/incendiary ammo can light the arsonist and his accelerant on fire. It can't.

Nope. When certain arts organizations support "gun control" they are absolutely related.
To illustrate the point that most orgs really don't benefit the needy: 
Policing suffers every time it is charged with violating civil rights by enforcing categorically unconstitutional and inhumane laws that "non-profit" "gun control" orgs write, called "Model Laws".
@_date: 2013-09-30 00:57:02










However, when you add the most common training that you are only to shoot to stop, not kill, that means you should not muzzle cover unless you are willing to destroy the threat only by stopping it.

You have no right to think that crazy totalitarian state agents don't have the right to murder people they have arrested for mere drug use and/or posession!

Sufficient awareness of the cold civil war will either end it peacefully, or the State will try to end it by repeating its bloody history of genocide. At that point, citizens will know, unequivocally: defend yourself, or be put to rest in a mass grave.

But it is most certainly used as such, maybe even at a similar rate per capita that people die from gunshot wounds.

So something like this happened?
Hyatt Gun Shop: Hello Authorize.net, I'd like to sign my business up for credit card processing.
Authorize.net: ... and what does your business entail?
Hyatt Gun Shop: Selling guns in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws. We see that is not a prohibited activity in your terms of service.
Authorize.net: Correct, it is not prohibited, we gratefully accept your business. ... Great, your contract for our services is now in place, expect your terminal via UPS in 5 days.
Years later...
Authorize.net: Fuck you Hyatt, we're breaking the contract.
Hyatt: WTF?

This seems awfully Chicken Little, especially when there should be someone local who's willing to cash out your BTC on a regular/contract basis, if you don't want to use BitPay. What percentage of your vending has people paying in BTC?

If I thought you really believed what you said, I would say to pull your head out of the sand/take your blinders off. 
But you're talking absolute tosh, straight out of the "Gun Control/Criminal Safety playbook", as if nobody in Canada ever has had, or will have, or should have, any legitimate fear for their life, or that they will suffer grievous bodily harm with any weapon whatsoever (including fists and feet).
Prove that no defenseless innocents are ever/can ever be harmed in Canada and that self-defense is not a human right, or stop cluttering my inbox with the wet dreams of violent criminals, 100% of whom depend on "gun control" for their continued survival and bloody acts, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.
@_date: 2013-09-30 01:56:58
Nobody in a developed country has lived their entire life and died a peaceful death without ever being within 1 km of a gun held by their government.
1 murder, rape, maiming, or other victimization of a defenseless innocent because their government pretended to have no duty to protect them, is 1 too many, categorical proof of the infringement of their human right to self-defense.
Again, the "Gun Control/Criminal Safety playbook" is used to define all crimes with guns, as all "crime". That feigned ignorance needs to stop, NOW.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:40:26
Because cameras that show little more than humanoid blurs DEFINITELY deter crime...

A corporate contributor/crony to the world's most powerful "gun control" leader burns the/a "No1 Gun store" as if it were acting as an agent of said leader, and this thread isn't about "gun control"? 
BAHAHAHAHAHA! Where are you doing standup in Chicago tonight?
@_date: 2013-09-30 01:10:25
When you say "gun crime", that's right out of "Gun Control/Criminal Safety 101" - act like gun crime is "crime", and if there's little to no "crime", then everybody should be denied their human right to effective self-defense, despite how much violent crime that deserves semi-lethal response (guns, which have a low mortality rate) actually occurs.
@_date: 2013-09-30 00:37:37
Those who have learned how to use bladed weapons would not make ignorant statements like this, unless they were pretending to be ignorant in order to render only innocents effectively defenseless (via "gun control") against every probable violent criminal attack.
Edit: "Use a sword/knife" has been said non-sarcastically before, so consider this a response in advance to anyone who would say it seriously. Upvoted you.

I doubt CCTV being used as the only piece of evidence results in judge/jury convictions per se. Guilty pleas from people being lied to by cops (saying "we have you on video", no, you cunts, you have a humanoid blob on video), with weak/no representation, maybe. Any competent lawyer would say "the prosecution has provided a single piece of evidence, CCTV footage of a humanoid blob. That could be x number of citizens in this country with the exact a, b, and c physical characteristics. We move to dismiss this case, as the prosecution has not met its burden."
I've been to lots of banks, and unless they are sitting in CCTV rooms without windows ready to rush out and take down robbers, very few of them have armed guards. Even the unarmed guards I've seen tend to stand outside banks, and would only really risk getting hurt if they happened to come inside.
Only use a bank if it has controlled access, a functional metal detector (although there are non-metallic knives), and at least one armed guard inside that you trust to kill a criminal for you.

A self-defense claim isn't completely indefensible as long as drug offenses where nobody dies, let alone is a victim in any way whatsoever, are capital offenses in &gt;0 countries.
See 
But, we have to remember, the U.S. Government thinks it's perfectly acceptable for its employees [to say indefensible shit like “You can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs” over the corpse of a Border Patrol agent killed with a gun given to violent criminals by the U.S. Government.](

The claim is "No1"... IDK what gives anyone the support to say that. Unless the Bureau of Assholes, Tyrants, and Fuckasses ranks shops based on number of background checks processed and actually releases that data to the public without a federal court order for violating FOIA.
