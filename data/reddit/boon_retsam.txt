No, it really isn't. If you have overall smaller unit widths (1 cm being smaller than 1 inch), it's a lot easier to accidentally combine somewhat different amounts. You're using 1.75 meters because it hits an easy fraction of halfway between 1.5 and 2m (the same reason imperial is actually easier in such cases--fractions), but you would not be able to, at a glance, determine if someone walking by you is 1.73 or 1.75 or if they were 1.75 vs 1.77m tall. That's a difference of a full inch, and police officers legitimately don't trust people to make that determination. You'd probably determine 1.73 vs 1.77, obviously, because that's nearly 2 inches.
I honestly think that if you lined up metric users and imperial users and had someone fake a robbery with the robber running past a door with a ruler on it, the imperial users would be closer to the height than the metric users. I think that's because they're used to operating within an 8-inch range for most people vs metric users operating in around a 20 cm range.
You mention 2m. Frankly, you don't see anything 2m long in day to day life. That's someone about 6'5". That's a professional basketball player. Everyone you see generally falls between 5'2" and 6'2" depending on gender.
It's not a matter of what you're used to using, it's a matter of our brains not being able to intuitively handle large numbers. We end up grouping them together.
Saying something is 180 cm tall is absolutely less intuitive, accurate in eyeballing a measurement, or overall useful than saying 5'10".


Not really. I grew up learning both, being a latin american immigrant to the US. Imperial units are more intuitive, based on body measurements, with a foot being roughly an adult male foot, a yard being about a full step, an inch being about a thumb tip length, etc. And while I can instantly "thumb to index finger" a cm vs an inch, the inch is just more useful for what we see in day to day life. Overall, a cm is too small and a meter is too big for what we really use measurements for, and nobody actually uses decimeters. Hence why I believe a base 12 number system with a base 12 measurement system and a base 12 time system would have been the best overall system available.


Oh, great. So, that conversion, that helped you in any way? If you took 1 less step to 3.978 km, what difference does it make to anything in your life that it turns into 397,800 cm? Like, how wonderful that your units just move a decimal point. But... what use is that? Sure, if you're gonna launch a rocket or do chemistry that's useful (and I say that as someone that completed a chemistry degree), but otherwise what difference does that make? If I walk a mile, why would it matter how many feet I walked? It's not like you knowing 400K cm = 4km actually does anything for your daily life. That's what I'm talking about--daily life use trumps easy convertibility between wildly different unit sizes for anything besides incredibly large distances or incredibly small units as used in chemistry or rocket launches, and overall, if we had just transitioned to a base 12 system, we'd have gotten the benefits of both.

Cleaner and logical doesn't matter much when trying to make something intuitive, which is what a measurement system should strive for. It's really only cleaner and logical because we use a base 10 system, so you can convert units. But, really, how often does conversion of units actually matter in day to day life?
Metric isn't as good for carpentry, among other uses, because it doesn't *divide* well. A base 10 system only really has one division--1/2. Take 1 cm, divide it, you're at 5 mm. If you do that again into 1/4ths, you now have a further decimal point at 2.5mm. The strength of the imperial system is the fractional nature of it.
It makes more sense to mill a bunch of tools and screws for things like 1/8", 1/4", 1/2", 3/4", 1", a simple division into further halves, rather than 1 mm 2 mm 3mm 4mm 5mm 6mm 7mm 8mm 9mm 1cm 1.1cm 1.2cm 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5cm, all of which are possible units along the exact same length.
Some people might say that strength doesn't overcome the unit conversion and easier math of metric, and that's a reasonable argument. I argue instead that metric should have been base 12 to begin with, preserving both the easy math/conversion and the good fractional nature which would have made it easier to use day to day.

Yeah, mainly that. Having two units--everybody knows what 5' and 6' looks like, followed by an inch number, makes it easier to visualize. 
5'6" is halfway in between. That's the average woman. 5'8" is a fairly tall woman. 5'10" is the average guy. 6' is a fairly tall guy. Having a single digit differentiate all that is easier to "see" in your head than instinctively noticing the difference between two people at 178 and 182 cm, especially for things like a gas station clerk telling a cop how tall the robber was, or whatever. Basically, once you get above a couple tens' places in any notation, human brains start having a harder time visualizing it.
So if we were at a "metric" base 12, with 1 "foot" (or whatever it was called) being 12 units, you could still have the ease of use of the imperial measurement system (and its subsequent ease of divisibility) while having the math actually work as well as the metric system does.

Basically what Daniel_RM said. Just day to day use stuff.
On the unit circle, 90 degrees being 76 isn't too big a deal. 180 degrees would be notated 130, with 76 being half of that. And 360 base 10 would be 260 base 12. 1/6th of a circle, or 60 degrees base 10, would be 50 in base 12. So we'd just use 1/6th of a circle as a more natural unit (we already do with time--ten minutes being a pretty standard grouping for things like commuting, being 1/6th of an hour), though 1/4th wouldn't be too bad, 1/2 would be fine, 1/3rd would be fine.
Our equations for math (like circumference of a circle being 2*pi*r) would probably just use tau instead of pi (tau is 2 pi), which is also more intuitive for learning math too.

Honestly, when the French set up the whole metric system, they should gone with the suggestion to make everything base 12 instead of base 10. Just need a separate symbol for our current number 10 and 11. Then you'd have the benefits of both systems:
Easy divisibility for every day measurements and units (dividing lengths into 1/3 or 1/4 or 1/2 easily as opposed to having to notate everything into 10 equal lengths and only having the 1/2 division), which is where the real strength of the US/Imperial system comes into play; along with this, your numbering system wouldn't end up with stuff like "178 cm tall" which is unwieldy to visualize, and would make the digits for large numbers somewhat smaller.
Easy conversion of units and an easier time doing math (any base 12 system, once in place, is just as useful and easy to convert and do math in as our normal base 10 system) which is where the metric system really shines.
AND it would have the added benefit of matching up with our time units easier--perhaps our clock would have been divided into 12 segments (2 hrs long each, or 120 minutes) which could each be divided into 12 segments (of our current 10 minutes each).
