What are the best ways to sweep a paper wallet these days?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:58:49
Ethereum, IOTA, Bitcoin Cash... Basically any coin that doesn't limit the block size like Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:54:19
And lightning doesn't?
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:23:15
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:50:47
Basically every other crypto is better than Bitcoin. What Bitcoin does have is only first mover advantage, which also makes it the most secure because of the number of nodes and the hash power. But the technology is strictly inferior.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:11:22
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:34:19

You'd be paying double the price for that pizza if you include the transaction fee.

You can download the block chain via torrent on Bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:34:02
Bitcoin is open source. There's no such thing as a "rip off". 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:35:54

If you look at the early mailing list his vision was for most people to use SPV and full nodes to be expensive to maintain. He wanted bigger blocks for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:15:34
I still don't see how lightning will solve regular purchases. Will I have to open a payment channel and lock up money with every vendor I might visit? Someone please explain to me.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:55:17
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:50:11
I'm actually curious and not trying to be a dick here. You read about the technology, so what in your mind makes Bitcoin better than the many alternatives?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:59:58
Why would people who can't even use Bitcoin because of the fees run a full node? This is insanity!
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:35:23
Ethereum and several alts have vastly more potential utility than Bitcoin. Investing into them is not a bad idea that should be so easily dismissed.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:54:04
They do have bigger blocks also. Ethereum handles more transactions than Bitcoin daily and has super low fees.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:52:28
Absolutely fucking not! My comment came across the wrong way, what I meant was: Leave this piece of shit sub and stop supporting it. 
I only comment here to see how the people who are left are handling all of this. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:58:37
Well, one could argue that this would force people to read all the comment responses, which would give a more accurate picture than just a raw score.

If you are trying to inform yourself about an unknown topic you have no idea how to think critically about it yet, so knowing what most people agree with is quite helpful.
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:15:04
What will end up happening in practice is that services like Coinbase will replace bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:09:01
Exactly! Don't these people understand that the "blockchain technology" is only as strong as the miner network that supports it? 
Do they expect to create one themselves? If so they are retarded, because its only use is the fact that it's decentralised.
Do they want to support an alt coin? Again, they are retarded! Bitcoin has the strongest network so it it automatically the most secure one!
I'm getting fucking sick of this shit! Support bitcoin to support a strong blockchain!
@_date: 2014-07-13 11:46:26

This is actually good news™
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:27:55
Then why is the price so low?
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:05:47
And demand should increase with good news, correct?
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:32:30
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:40:14
He could start selling little by little. And yes, that would definitely drive the price down so much as to make bitcoin worthless. 
This is really the only fear I have for bitcoins future. If bitcoin where to replace fiat entirely, to much power would reside with to few people. It would be an oligarchy of an unheard of magnitude. 
I think 30 or something people control 70%&lt; of all bitcoins. They effectively control the price. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 20:46:34
Why would they do it? Because their wallet service is bad, and can only be bad because of regulations. This creates a bad image for both Bitcoin and Coinbase. People probably don't care about one-to-one alternatives, they just want an immediate way to get bitcoin, which they could still provide without the included wallet service.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:59:54
Bitalo also allows you to buy bitcoins, and they do not controll your private keys.
Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not affiliated with bitalo! If you check this whole comment section you will see that I mention lots of services, and I'm merely doing this because I think it's appropriate to mention an alternative if I say that one exists.

How about just sending one address at a time, and prompting the user before sending one?
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:24:03
Why wouldn't it make wide adoption less likely? Would you really want to invest in a currency where the price is dictated by the whims of 30 people?
And I know what you are thinking, people: Fiat is the same!!! 
Yes that is true, but that is why smart people generally don't store large amounts of wealth in fiat

Oh is officially not a faggot 
@_date: 2014-07-06 10:17:21

But there doesn't need to be any understanding involved, they just need to follow simple instructions? 
I get what you are saying, but I'm talking about a detailed step-by-step guide. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:37:32
There has not been a pull request, at least not that I can find. I'm no programmer so I don't actually know if it is possible to implement, but I'm guessing that it should be.
But the fact of the matter remains that the mining system as it was originally thought to work is poorly implemented as, if you use it like it was intended to be used, you could never expect a reliable profit out of it.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:01:50

This is wrong. Bitcoins spam prevention fees prevent microtransactions without going through a third party like changetip, which as far as i know is on par if not sub par to credit cards and bank transfers.
Maybe I'm just ignorant here, but if changetip is gonna have a withdrawl limit anyway, what's preventing them from just integrating Paypal and not allowing withdrawls of below some amount?

@_date: 2014-09-05 18:18:30
No they can't. You have to wait for at least 1 confirmation before you can spend recieved funds.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:15:39
It would be free for both parties, probably due to the bitcoin backend
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:30:29
Alternatively: Hey IRS, my addressed were swept yesterday as you can see in the blockchain, so I have nothing for you to tax anymore. 
How will they ever know if you are lying? Just write down a seed from a deterministic wallet and you are golden!
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:08:44
As a wallet after purchase he means.
It requires  relatively little effort to transfer Bitcoin to an external wallet and as they have been shown to track you it's worth it.
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:37:01
Oh my god, why do people keep saying this? 
There are tried and complete, relatively simple methods to do cold storage WITHOUT getting a third party involved! 
I'll give you one right now: 
1. Buy a Raspberry pi with an included pre-installed SD card, 
2. Install electrum
3. Remove the ethernet cable from the pi 
4. Save the seed and the master public key. 
Done. It's as simple as that. 
Do you really mean to tell me that people are to stupid to be able to do that? They don't even need knowledge of how anything works, they just need to know that it is a safe method. 
Seriously people, if we encourage newcomers to use these services instead of decentralized ones in fear that they 'won't understand' I believe that we'll be making them a big disservice. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:12:52
No we can't. That's why we need a decentralized solution

Buy a Trezor. It's by far the most secure way. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 11:58:11
Sorry for my ignorance but why would you want to use multisig with the Trezor? 
If the keys never leave the device you can't be at risk right?

I would advise you to use Electrum for this process instead. 
Do the same thing, Ubuntu live CD, save the master public key for watch only, and save the seed in a piece of paper. 
Personally I don't understand why one would prefer Armory over Electrum as Electrum is much more light weight and the watch only wallet doesn't require the blockchain to be downloaded
@_date: 2014-07-03 08:58:36
Yes, it is always necessary to provide your Personal Identification Number Number when using an Automatic Teller Machine Machine. It is specified in the Application Programming Interface Interface. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:11:18
I don't know. Except for your torture example, wouldn't the 'best' way be to memorize a strong brain wallet paraphrase, or to memorize an electrum seed? 
If done offline and on a live CD why isn't this 100% secure? I mean even if electrum is not around in say 10 years, you can always find the source code cant you?

It would probably be cheaper and better to just use a raspberry pi, buy a per-installed version of NOOBS from the swag store just to be sure.
And it is probably safer to just download armory to the computer directly instead and later disabling WIFI, using an intermediary computer only increases the risks.

You most certainly will not shoot yourself in the foot if you buy a Trezor.
If you have a lot of bitcoin you should buy a Trezor, never trust a third party unless necessary

I got sceptical at:

Even if this is true their service is still inferior
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:37:55
Still applies. You shouldn't use circle as a wallet, just to buy
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:48:13
Yeah That's Pretty Cool Bro

This exactly. I'm so tired of people saying this isn't a big deal.
It is a very big deal and we should fight this by only promoting P2Pool to new miners, that way we'd at least be moving in the right direction.
I don't think that simply switching pools is enough. GHash wasn't always the biggest pool, people switched to it from BTC Guild when they got to large.
We really need to start only promoting P2Pool.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:00:31
It's nice and all, but saying it like that makes people want to hoard it and that certainly isn't something that we want to encourage. 
I think we should be promoting the real benefits of bitcoin rather than get people interested because they believe that it will be a 'get rich quick' method

@_date: 2014-04-24 20:49:28
It doesn't have to be human nature, it's just that the reward for using violence in such a system is to great, which makes the whole system an unstable state. 
Take trees for example: Imagine a world where all trees where as tall as men or about 2 meters. This would be very beneficial for the trees, after all, the energy that it would have otherwise had to use to grow tall and transport water to the up most branches can now be used to produce offspring. 
There is a problem here however, this only works if all trees are of the same height, as they can't capture enough sunlight otherwise. All it takes is one "rogue" tree and that tree now enjoys great benefits from its additional height, because even though it has to spend more energy to get taller it gets more light than the other trees. Rationally it would be in every tree's best interest to grow as tall as possible in order to not lag behind the others. 
What we have encountered here is called an unstable state, which means that while it is optimal for the trees to be short, it relies on the other trees also being short with it, and there is just no way for the tree to know that the others are gonna be short when it brings such benefits to outgrow the rest. 
This is analogous to an anarchic state, it should be the best solution but it is an unstable state: you can't know how the others will act, if they are gonna be altruistic or psychotic or whatever. It is always rational for any individual to try to disrupt the order before someone else does, so it is bound to be ephemeral. 
What government brings is an incentive to follow laws: punishment and violence. This is not unstable as it would be irrational for people to break the law (assuming they don't believe they'll get away with it) and as such you have a sense of security, even though you are living suboptimaly compared to how you could have lived in an anarchy. 
The fact of the matter is that anarchy requires a great amount of trust in other people to act "irrationally". It just isn't feasible.

In the fiat world, 35 % of all wealth that will ever be is not controlled by 30 people. Because of the way the fiat system works, the money supply increases to account for new productivity.
In the bitcoin world, 21 million bitcoins represent the total productivity of humanity that will ever be, this means that 30 people owning 35 % of that is a very dangerous thing since their ownership of "the world" won't be diluted.

Without having to buy anything? Why is that relevant? 
Would you honestly trust a third party with your keys rather than buy a $40 pc? 
Sorry of i was condescending, it was never my intent 
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:31:44
Let's do it! 
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:27:26
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:30:04
Still, It's hurtful to both them and the bitcoin community overall that they even offer a wallet service if this is the case. Why not just acknowledge that the laws are absurd and then not offer the service, thus not giving a negative "big-brother" first impression of bitcoin to new adopters.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:12:40
Creating a wallet using electrum or blockchain.info hardly necessitates you to be a specialist
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:44:56
There are actually several good methods to prevent double spending quicker than 10 minutes.
The arguably best way is to check the network propagation of the transaction. This means that you consider the transaction valid only when you estimate that a certain number of nodes have received it.
Mycelium and bitpay already have this functionality although it depends on their private servers.
I'd really like to see this functionality implemented in a decentralized way, perhaps by implementing it into Bitcoin core, though we'd have to talk to the devs to know if this is possible.
Another way is to implement green addressing, which basically means that you trust a third party to validate the transaction.
GreenAddress.it are able to do this within their wallets because they provide the second key needed to sign the transaction message.
I'm a little unclear on the details of this, though I'm sure could elaborate.
While this method obviously works if you choose to trust the third party, I'd much rather like to see a decentralized trustless alternative prevail.
@_date: 2014-12-14 11:51:41
You're right in that those features are necessary, but why would you need bitpay for them? Couldn't we create a piece of open source software to handle all that?
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:06:28
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:46:34


FTFY 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:20:51
Truth be told though, at the moment excluding those features, what could really be getting people into bitcoin? 
Credit cards and bank transfers are better for most conventional tasks right now, so why would your average joe create a coinbase account and buy bitcoin?
My best bet is that the average person who registeres at coinbase just heard about bitcoin, saw what differentiated it from conventional currencies at the moment (those features you just mentioned), wanted to get in on the action and saw Coinbase almost unanymously being recommended as the best option for beginners.
How do you think those people will percieve bitcoin after being subject to something like this by the most widely lauded company within the community?
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:13:05
Just buy a Trezor already™
@_date: 2014-07-06 10:25:47
Isn't using electrum a better method? 
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:36:20


What's that?
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:38:40
[It is](
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:12:37
Which only work in the US
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:35:22
Agreed, new people should read the wiki or check out for specific questions 
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:01:49
Yes, but I'm reffering to todays early adopters.
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:01:46
That is completely ridiculous. 
The easiest way would be to just print an address on the page, though they might not want to hold. 
Does it say which API it's using? 
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:14:28
Are the words used in BIP32 wallets standardized or do the individual wallets select which words to use themselfs?
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:32:24
Deffinetaly all of it. With our current knowledge life without water is inconceivable.
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:58:16
Couldn't you in theory construct a decentralized localbitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:17:10
Shit son. That's a lot of paper!
@_date: 2014-12-09 00:34:38
If you can't justify buying a Trezor you probably don't need cold storage.
When you are talking about storing significant amounts of money it's a small price to pay for maximum security.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:46:50
I was hoping no one would figure it out
@_date: 2014-12-05 05:56:48
And that kids name? Albert Einstein 
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:48:34
Hosted keys = Stay the fuck away 
@_date: 2014-12-29 08:22:15
But what's the difference effectively? 
Basically what you wrote is that one method is "more classic" than the other.
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:15:35
Better to think of a truly decentralized solution. The silk road approach is inferior to the open Bazaar approach 
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:39:49
@_date: 2014-10-19 22:25:16
Additionally you could memorize it 
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:19:59
Open Bazaar is the eBay of bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-07-25 08:05:46
A gonvernments main function is to have a monopoly on using violence, and that function is essential so that our society does not decend to some form of feudalism.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:24:49
But it's not 'tinfoil hat' secure: You have to trust the bank. I was thinking more 0 trust. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 14:10:23
How does this compare to zerocoin? 
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:27:08
Sure, but I always pictured the early adopters as being 'tinfoil-hat crazy' about security. This just doesn't seem like something those people would have in mind...
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:12:34
Please deliver
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:50:38
I thought most miners were quite tech savvy
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:07:23
I was not aware of that no...
So maybe you are right, maybe the world is ruled by extreme oligarchy already.
But shouldn't we take precautions to prevent this from happening to bitcoin? This is a new technology after all. 
One guy ITT mentioned Vertcoin. Could that be technology we could implement?
@_date: 2014-03-14 07:52:49
If Nakamoto really owns 1M BTC and decides to sell them all. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:10:11
ELI5 Are side-chains and colored coins the same thing? Can you have one with a different hashing algorithm? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:07:22
Aren't these very good reasons for creating this guide? People need to understand and see how simple it really is 
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:32:22
How is that different from Litecoin or Dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:06:30
Agreed. Coinbase too. And Greenaddress. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:49:26
But is this 100% secure? I don't think so, because at some point you have to trust that the OS is analyzing the md5sum correctly. Although it is improbable, would you trust $1M+ with that in mind?
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:04:50
How does this compare to diaspora? 
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:18:00
I have been trying to design icons like this for a very long time and I'm just wondering, how did you make them look so good?
By that I mean symmetrical and with the correct proportions and everything. I can't ever seem to get that right.
@_date: 2014-07-22 19:27:50
Exactly! Like what am I paying you for? 
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:34:44
So what you are saying is that I will be able to type in my electrum seed into bitcoin-QT and it will still work?
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:24:26
Right... Hadn't thought of that.
@_date: 2014-03-16 10:04:48
That's the TL;DR of it, yeah :) 
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:58:21
So, basically the website? 
@_date: 2014-12-14 11:50:13
This is exactly the kind of thing I like to see in bitcoin! Not people just reverting to classic centralized solutions because it's simpler. 
Please guys, do promote decentralized alternatives when possible! This is a great example of when you do so.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:34:15
Dear God, not this analogy again 
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:00:36
What's the IRS' policy for if you lose your private key?
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:16:53
And all is well again... 
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:58:53
What is your view on the many centralized services emerging around bitcoin? Do you belive that they are necessary or just ephemeral alternatives to decentralized solutions that are to come?

That doesn't sound very logical. An oligarchy is always bad, regardless of weather the oligarchs have different backgrounds.
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:26:26

What if electrum is no longer around by the time you want to withdraw?
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:09:31
It will probably be used for legitimate purposes to. All I'm saying is that the technology is to good for people to not realize that it could be used for illegal goods 
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:01:53

It's probably unlikely that Google would be interested at this point, but if we get the changetip usage up who knows? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:59:44

One question, could other crypto currencies be expressed as a colored coin, like Litecoin for example? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:05:30
Create an electrum wallet yourself and give them the seed. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:38:07
It is. If you imagine bitcoin being the same size as fiat it would be much less fair.
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:29:30
Actually, how fun wouldn't it be for some rich guy to do that? Just send out a map online with an ambiguous X marking the location XD.
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:32:15
This is great, it's just a shame that they just cash everything out to fiat.
I'm by no means an expert on this, couldn't they just save the bitcoins? The amout of people using bitcoin on their site should be quite small anyway right?
I realize that this doesn't scale that well, but they could at least save SOME of it, because as of right now you are probably hurting the market by using bitcoin at their site.
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:17:56
How do you verify that this is the actual bootloader used on the device? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:13:48
That's not the point. The point is that changetip gives Bitcoin a bad rep.
Kind of like telling people the same thing about vuvuzelas at the world cup
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:19:24
Is this decentralized and trust less? 
@_date: 2014-12-14 11:25:49
Gold is most certainly not "more scarce" than bitcoin. Really talking about it that way is confusing as they can't even be measured with the same units.
They are both limited in supply which makes them both scarce, however, bitcoin is limited in supply by deffinition whereas gold is limited due to technological limitations.
It's not hard to imaine a not to distant future where asteroid mining has been perfected, and at that point gold will be worthless. Bitcoin is eternal.
@_date: 2014-03-14 09:12:09
I'm sure people would switch to alternatives if 70% of all XBT where sold ⇒ Death of Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-22 05:43:44
Yes, and it will probably steal a significant market share from precious metalls as bitcoin is a lot easier to store
@_date: 2014-07-07 09:50:35
Seriously though that stuff rarely happens, especially on phones. What's more likely to happen is that he could forget his password which would definitely be a problem. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 11:45:27
Doing so would require them to consistantly provide that computing power to the network for the majority of the time.
Your frear is analogous to being affraid that a billionaire will purchase all of the lottery tickets. It could happen, and he could sustain it for a couple of times but in the long run he'll always lose.

As usual then
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:12:27

The storage point is pretty idealistic.


Easy, maybe in the future. Free, absolutely not. Unless you can convince everyone to use brain wallets the most likely cenario we'll see in the furure is a multi-sig setup with a secure third party involved, and that will cost money.
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:10:35
People realy need to understand that gonvernments DO have authority on this, and can effectively regulate Bitcoin by regulating fiat to Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:11:17
That depends. 
If you utilize the same method as blockchain does where you store the keys without having access to them, I would trust you more.
If you use Coinbases method people probably wouldn't trust you.
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:28:31
Of course, but circle could provide a great start and it could happen right now! Seamless credit card integration and a free Bitcoin backend

Yeah, although just for fun :) I just wanted to see if it would be too difficoult, like that you would need a whole team. Thank you for your response, I'm gonna start right now!

@_date: 2014-05-05 22:39:59
But why wouldn't you be your own bank? Why shouldn't we as a community try to make decentralized options available and promote them to people? 
Crazy as it sounds, there really is no good reason for us to use such services in most cases, there is no reason to use Coinbase instead of Blockchain for example. 
Of course there are examples where you actually need to use services that hold your private keys, people who trade should probably use an exchange inserted of localbtc, but for the majority of people the majority of the time, this isn't the case. 
When people say this it really just looks like a cry for help from 'the big guys'  to come and help the masses use bitcoin. The thing is: We don't need them! 
We can create, and there are open source and decentralized solutions for the masses. You should use Blockchain.info inserted of coinbase because overall it is better for us all to decentralize the power. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 13:31:03
Then what news does increase it?
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:22:42
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:53:51
Then we as a community recommend this solution! 
Me including a link to Amazon is enough for people to understand what a pi is.

@_date: 2014-03-16 10:46:01
Why not use Blockchain.info, it's as good and it'd decentralized!
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:57:30

If the price stabilizes it will be very possible to stay rich, and to get richer, by simply holding because of bitcoins deflationary nature. 
The only way that it will not be profitable is if the value is in a constant decline, but I doubt that this is how it will turn out.
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:32:50
Lol :) Not a native speaker. Did I use it correctly? 
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:57:02
The problem is: People like Nakamoto won't sell anything until they believe that the price has stabilized because they consider the current prize to be too cheap, and they are probably right.
So most likely their ownership will not be diluted until it's "to late" and they have wealth in the 11th order of magnitude. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:10:47
I don't know how many bitcoins you own, but how do you do it then?
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:48:54

Are you fucking serious? Name a single commodity besides Bitcoin that could replace gold.
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:02:01
I did not mean it like that. 
What I ment was that in todays world, if there are such powerful entities that control a proportion of the wealth of that magnitude, they are probably rich and democratic governments and no matter how corrupt those governments may be, people still have more agency in those them than in this hypothetical future society where their influence of what happens with that wealth is exactly 0
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:54:36
Ok, first of all: Mt gox
Second: That's not what I said, I said that most people lose their bitcoins because of forgotten passwords and such
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:56:42

You can't that I know of, I'm just asking why it wouldn't be possible
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:51:08
You should probably clarify that a transaction can only be cleared during their working hours. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:06:04
What the actual fuck?

You only have to worry about hosted wallets (wallets that hold your private keys), which you should probably avoid anyway as more governments could follow the US's example. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:28:56
They require ID in the US? Hm...

These ideas are very old. Hundreds of people have proposed a decentralized currency but no one could implement it of the double spending problem. 
The real genius of bitcoin wasn't the idea of a decentralized digital currency, it's that it solves the double spending problem. 
Really bitcoin could just be seen as Satoshis "proof of concept" for his solution. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:51:44
Is it trustless like on-chain transactions?

Good that you didn't use it for savings, but still: Why use that shit site at all?
@_date: 2015-01-01 04:00:05
I'd recommend Bitcoin Wallet instead of Mycelium as it doesn't rely on centralized validation.
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:30:51
You've gotta be kidding me with the credit card fraud example right? 
Are you seriously suggesting that it is more likely to happen than your bitcoins getting stolen?

Du borde verkligen försöka igen. Jag vet att de hade lite problem för några månader sedan men det funkar med mitt visa nu.
Circle är överlägset bäst enligt mig och det är billigare trots kreditkortsavgiften.
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:27:22
What would be more secure:
1. Using my Trezors own randomness generator 
or 
2. Providing my own entropy using dice rolls

This is redicilous, the creator of this game is paying more in transaction fees than the money he sends.

@_date: 2015-05-28 21:14:19
Truthfully though, do you have friends who want to know how bitcoin ACTUALLY works or do they just want to learn how to use it?
I think people generally in this sub tend to confuse the two.

Well Circle is currently the only company that allows you to purchase bitcoin with your credit card, which is the most frictionless method of purchase available.

Alternatively to this awesome idea, you could set up a 2/3 multisig adress. One for you, one for your family and one for the bank/lawyer. Tell the bank/lawyer to only release their key if you die. 
If they're gonna steal your money it would require the bank and your family to conspire against you, which is ridiculously unlikely.

1 GB today? That would be 144 GB of data per day! No one would be able to afford the storage for that.

That's litteraly this entire sub! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:20:05
Not true at all. The vast majority of golds value comes from people using it as a store of value. As long as people still believe others will do so, it will maintain it's value. All other applications could disappear and it would make no difference. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:23:35
It's not a second layer solution. It's SPV. It's used by Multibit and Bitcoin for Android. 
It does. The original vision was clearly to have less full clients and bigger blocks. To actually eventually have only larger organizations run full nodes, with the rest of ordinary users using SPV
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:37:44


You probably didn't mean it in a crass way, but please don't undermine what these companies are doing. 
It takes huge effort to make it possible to trade a non-reversible commodity, like Bitcoin, with the most reversible payment method on the planet: credit cards. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:17:30
I honestly don't see the problem with further centralization. As long as there are a reasonable amount of miners, there's still huge incentives for them to be honest, and using SPV the average user can verify their transactions very well. 
It's the same as with any business really. Most people don't run their own businesses, but the economy is shaped in such a way that if many busnisess are doing their job poorly it opens up the opportunity for others to come in and make money because of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:24:33
The original vision for Bitcoin was on-chain scaling, not off-chain, which is the direction the project is going in now.

No, because if people jump in **because** of the recent price increase, instead of belief in the technology say, they're very likely go jump out as soon as they don't see the growth they wanted. Which means that most of these users are super fickle and will jump out quite readily all at the same time, which lowers the price significantly.

It still wasn't worth it. Sure you made *some* money, but you would've made more just buying Bitcoin directly
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:47:14
Oooooooo sick burn
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:51:14
It's still more scalable

How high could it go do you think?

Maybe not the best method but I've memorized mine. People say not to do this but I've had it, and several other seeds, memorized for years now. 
I repeat it about once a week and test it physically about once a month. Try it out and see if you can do it!

But the price right now isn't even indicative of it's usefulness. You can't tell me that this rapid increase in value is due to new adoption, it's purely speculation. 
Couldn't it also be the case that Bitcoin crashes and then regains it's current value when it actually gains more uses? Let's take remittances for example. If Bitcoin got, say, 20% of that market then what price would it have?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:05:05
You sure about that. People say that every boom, but eventually it has to stop growing. Aren't we close to that point now?
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:29:04
How does one secure such large amounts these days? I'm using a Trezor, but even that seems insufficient for such large amounts
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:31:39
How is XT a scam?
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:34:51
How high do you think it will go?
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:49:36
So is Gold
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:11:36
Why not just use true cold storage for such large funds? As in just putting a recovery seed alone in a vault and then not having a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:53:24
Indeed. Several alts are superior to Bitcoin already. All Bitcoin has is the momentum it got from being first. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:23:27
A colored coin would make more sense 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:59:10
No, a bubble just means that the **current** value is more representative of hype rather than more stable belief in the technology. If post people are just buying to get rich quick they're gonna sell as soon as the price drops just a little, or as soon as some irrelevant bad news starts to circulate. 
Contrast this to holders, who believe in the core technology and won't sell no matter what rumors circulate, because they know the technology will withstand that. That's the kind of users that stabaly increase the price. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:54:45
Either you'll be laughing with us or we'll all go down. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:00:16
How would they even enforce that?
@_date: 2015-04-14 12:37:05
Buy a Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:51:50
That actually inhibited economic growth since people are more likely to hoard than spend. 
But when it comes down to it it doesn't matter. Bitcoin is basically gold but superior in every single way imaginable and gold is still a huge market for storage of value. So at the very least Bitcoin will revolutionize that market. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:09:37
That's also because it came first, and thus is the most popular. More people having heard of bitcoin means more people that are likely to run a full node
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:58:18
Foolish how? OP basically said that he is interested in getting rich. Sure investing 15% of your money will still make you money, but if you just want to get rich and don't care much about the money you're investing I can totally see OPs point. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:46:46
Bitcoin has a market value of over $80 Billion. It's far form penny stock territory
@_date: 2015-09-17 10:28:48
No. If all you care about is getting very rich with no middle ground, it makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:36:47
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:46:24
This one is actually true right now though, if by average you mean the average human on earth.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:17:21
Couldn't you actually do it? Would be super funny.

Serious question: Why isn't core implementing replay protection? Isn't not doing it basically waiting for shit to happen?

In what way are miners middle men?

Really? Typing circle.com is that hard?

Open Bazaar? 
@_date: 2015-03-20 22:27:36
Most people here seem to miss the point. 
He is not saying that middle men aren't needed, uber for example is a great concept that drives down prices. 
He is implying that better solutions could be made. Does uber, for example, really need to be a centralized entity that collects large fees or could we find a blockchain solution?
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:12:09
That's great that it already exists, but I think what we'd want to see is the mods deterring such posts from this sub.

@_date: 2016-05-02 23:36:24
Dude, do you know how much money he has if he still has access to the genesis block? He could disrupt the entire bitcoin market if he chose.

When you think about it, wouldn't a decentralized marketplace where the farmer could sell his milk actually drive down the price?
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:32:22
No, don't. It will teach you exactly **nothing** you need to know about getting, securing and using Bitcoin. 
This is basically like saying "If you want to learn more about how to play soccer, try reading up on Newton's laws of motion." Ridiculous.

You honestly believe that if Coinbase gains enormous power by "bridging the gap" that they will ever give it up?
Using middle men like this can never lead to a closed loop Bitcoin economy, they will do anything to maintain their position. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:33:00
Electrum doesn't use SPV AFAIK.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:32:00
Nice to have made it

Do you mean that you could have an insecure password on coinbase but not say greenaddress?
Because functionally for the end user all it comes down to in both cases is to choose a password.
