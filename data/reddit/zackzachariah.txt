I am interested in what the other problems are with hashing it client side. Please do reply with a link to more reading or a brief explanation.
The more I think about it, the more I agree that hashing functions and salts do not *need* to be secret. I disagree, though, that a system that tries to keep them secret is "probably doing it wrong". A system that is successfully keeping a server-side salt secret is assuredly more secure since it means that an attacker, even if they stole the hashed passwords from the database, could not generate rainbow tables against them without also acquiring the salt.
Additionally, I do think that hashing on the client side is also inherently less secure since you are simplifying the problem of "what a password looks like" for attackers from all valid password strings to all valid hash results. I was wrong to call this rainbow tables, but it is still "less secure".

Brief web security point - though sending the password as a GET parameter is insane and no one should ever think it's the right solution, sending it as cleartext to the server over HTTPS actually is.
HTTPS for obvious reasons, so that it's encrypted over the wire. Sending it in cleartext (i.e. without additional encryption) is also import, though, since you really want all your extra encryption to be done server-side. Doing it in the browser would make it trivial to use plain old rainbow tables to figure out collisions. Doing the hash server-side affords you both the ability to keep the hashing function secret and to add a secret salt so that generic rainbow tables would be useless.
