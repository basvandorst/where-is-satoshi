do something about it? why?
nah, if bitcoin is flawed it will crash. we're in a free market. only the best survives.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:58:17
who the fuck are you? what the fuck is this post?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:31:51
as opposed to this sub which is not cultish at aaaaaall.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:26:03
how are youa rbitraging? in which exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:54:14
yes it is
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:38:41
this is off topic? really?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:47:36
I think zero value comes from bitcoin as a currency right now
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:23:23
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:40:08
because instead of that I can just use another crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:28:38
ethereum classic
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:56:56
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:47
you cant buy $20 of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:36:39
yeah users here have a hard time realizing that bitcoin is not the ONLY crypto
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:28:07
"Bigger idea"
wtf does that even mean??
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:18:42
True. It sucks.
Some of the other crypto communities are not toxic at all. 
While Bitcoin is like "dae Roger Ver, dae core"
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:25:39
because the developers of bitcoin refused to increase the block size. so other developers thought, "ok, we'll increase the size"
bitcoin is open source. you can look at the code and think "hey, i can make this better" and fork it, create your coin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:53:53
you're retarded if you did that
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:05:26
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:58:59
no its not
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:06:11
top quality shitpost.
discussion like this one will definitely help the bitcoin community
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:10:14
I know how to change the fees. 
check this 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:58:31
yeah but he did it.
it's like saying "Apple wouldve happened anyway. if not Jobs, then another guy wouldve pushed it to become this huge company"
maybe, maybe not. But he contributed A LOT to make btc mainstream
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:33:31
supply &amp; demand based on just hype is  the definition of a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:17:27
so a node is like a bank?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:20:37
do you really think one person can crash bitcoin this much?
because if he did, bitcoin is a shitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:48
you're so cringy dude
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:15:52
hey mods, I thought posts about the price were not allowed
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:04:25
nah man. you're just arguing with edgy teenagers who think they'll be millionaires tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:33:20
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:03:30
Segwit doesnt help. Ask Shapeshift
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:40:26
where's the problem?
I can do the same thing. I can read the original satoshi paper and think: "hey, bitcoin right now its not like he envisioned. I'll make a fork and my bitcoin will be better"
Am I a fraud if I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:32:28
yep. im surprised why this post isnt banned.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:56:55
wtf is this post "like this if you think bitcoin is da best"
that account is just begging for retweets.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:49:13
"Upvote this if..."
wtf is this shit? circlejerk?
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:18:24
so we have to install all those packages just to send a transaction?
This is retarded/ Other coins are not so fucking compicated
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:27:06




are you retarded OP?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:50:31
yeah lol wtf are you talking about
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:33:23
Even if it was true, think about it. the biggest players in bitcoin dont want bitcoin anymore
Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain...
that means something
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:06:52
welcome to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:13:56
your title says "research paper from the CB of Finland"
it's not. Its a paper from 3 guys which have no association with the bank, except presented their paper to the bank.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:19:29
fiat system for 46 years?
99% of fiat has collapsed?
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:33:42
you cant buy $10 of bitcoin.
You can buy $10 of any other coin
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:00:02
wtf this is the LN?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:15:07
yea sorry, finland
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:43:33
and bitcoin is not?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:31
it was just $20 two days ago
fees are skyrocketing
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:11
this is spot on? really? so one guy can crash bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:00
loool why the fuck are you so childish?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:33:06
Insider trading regulates stocks. SEC regulates stocks.
But we dont want SEC to regulate bitcoin do we?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:21:50
Guys.. the dip.. it's not stopping...
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:50:53


@_date: 2017-12-22 14:02:28
then I dont wanna hold a coin which can be manipulated by one guy.
thats a weak shitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:32:12
yep hahaha and its upvoted to the front page??
users here are fucking retarded
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:45:36
Thats not a serious problem.
You cant transfer $10, so they're basically worthless. This is a serious problem
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:37:45
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:42:03
Jesus FUCK! where were these posts before they supported bitcoin cash??
This fucking retarded "community" is attacking coinbase, bitpay because the decided to support bitcoin cash too?
you're a bunch of basement dwelling neckbeards.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:25:44
what are we supposed to do with your username?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:00:24
when? if ETH is centralized so is BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:51:38
why dont you delete posts about the price?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:45:57
Because this guy said it it must be true.
If he'd work on LTC as much as he tweets about BTC, Litecoin would be $500 right now
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:58


lol thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:09
oh so then bitcoin is a shitcoin if one dude can crash it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:12:00
Does this mean that bitcoin right now  with LN is not what Satoshi created?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:57:35
only you can see the forest through the trees?
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:16:26
it's not a scam
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:37:49
nobody is spamming
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:18:38
yeah but its a meaningful amount to me.
also, how can bitcoin even be a currency for masses where amounts lower than the fees are basically worthless?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:07:40
lol how is this an awesome post?
have you actually tried using btc as a currency right now?
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:58:08
He also things bitcoin is the biggest bubble of our time...
so what do you think about him?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:53:18
why is this post FUD then?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:56:05
did coinbase announce it will add bitcoin cash by jan 1 months ago?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:21:27
is a scam like every coin is a scam. just imagine that every coin is like a religion to people because they have invested in it.
Bitcoin Cash is not a scam. Its just a fork of bitcoin with bigger block size
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:35:34
Average is $28!
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:33:47
wow what an argument
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:27:05


bingo. thats why everyone here is hysterical the moment they see another coin spike
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:52:42
dont you see how close minded you are?
this is like saying "only yahoo mail is the real mail. all other mails are fraud, because yahoo mail was the first"
mail is a known protocol, there will be different versions. let users decide which mail is better
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:13:04
whats this got to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:41:30
you dont like low fees?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:26:56


thats what he did
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:45:56
yet another post about the price
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:39:33
If funds are stolen from an exchange is it bitcoin's fault?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:21:33
dont do that. invest in more coins. if btc falls and other rise, you'll have nothing
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:14:50
yes it has.
According to another research (ill find it), the real price of bitcoin is $0
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:49:25
I thought price posts were banned
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:47
one person can crash the price 25%?
then bitcoin is shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:14:19
huh? I cant spend my bitcoins, not my fiat
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:13:09
which social function does it serve?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:18:28
wow, such an achievement for the bitcoin community
it's news like this that will keep people coming to bitcoin and will improve the technology.
also, priratebay writing bcash will lower the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:37:37
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:07:47
fake? really??
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:20:33
retarded comments like this are are why everyone laughs at bitcoin community
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:08:47
this post is worse than a meme
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:46:20
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:56:07


wtf are you talking about? how old are you?
because if you're older than 13 thats a concern.
how people can be so cultish and retarded?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:36:23
why would they?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:50:59


where else can you buy it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:07:45
whats your backup plan if bitcoin goes to $10,000 and stabilizes there for 5 years?
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:11:27
yes, title is misleading.
If OP actually read the paper (I did), it says  "This paper IN NO WAY reflects the position of the Bank of Norway"
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:16:34
Ethereum wasnt hacked, a Dapp was
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:29:07
Bitcoins is the most used coin? Really?
How many transaction per day does Ethereum? 1,000,000
Average tx fee? $0.8
How many transaction per day does bitcon? 300,000 
Average fee? $30
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:36:02
why do you want to trade altcoins if they're shit?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:52:40
if we user other cryptos for functionalities bitcoin is supposed to do, why do we even need bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:04:09
which serious economist believes all fiat is going to collapse?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:42:06
why? because they added another crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:41
laws? ahahahahaahahhahahahahahahaha
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:37:18
you're making the mistake of thinking users here are over 13 years old.
just check the front page. 90% of posts is DAE Roger Ver, DAE Jaime Dirmon
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:26:08
you'll get banned here for this type of post
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:06:26
care to tell us more.
you're just rambling.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:13:28
I thought I was gonna read an article maybe explaining the other side of this price.
but its yet another dicksucking circlejerk shitpost
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:03:09
Bitcoin is for the rich
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:15:50
so wtf are you talking about then?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:54:12
no man it crashed because DAE ROGER VER LETS CALL NBC AND ARREST HIM!!
didnt you know? every problem BTC has is because DAE ROGER VER
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:38:28
dude is probably 13 years old. dont try to argue with children.
Users here are in denial
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:02:32
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:21:40
wtf, you mean support added other users in the CC of the email?
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:10:16
look it up on the block chain, the tx id.
I doubt the coins have moved if you didnt put a destination address
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:00:14
insider trading doesnt apply to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:37:21
Actually it's bitcoin who is alienating the businesses not vice versa.
Steam dropped it because it doesnt make sense anymore to buy stuff with btc.
Bitpay will use other cryptos. I will use other cryptos if I want to buy stuff.
I dont use bitcoin anymore to buy. I cant even buy small amounts of bitcoin anymore because of the fees. If you have $20 in btc in a wallet, those are lost. You cant move them.
This is why businesses are dropping btc. Its not a monopoly of cryptos, it's a democracy. IF a better crypto emerges, all want to use that
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:00:26
Fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:26:06
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:39:00
thanks nostradamus
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:50:11
you do know that even bitcoin was forked? it's not the same it was in 2009?
so why only this bitcoin is the true successor of the original bitcoin?
In fact, the only "original" bitcoin is the unforked code released in 2009. 
So either this bitcoin we have now, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold etc, are all frauds  or whichever code is closer to satoshi's original vision is the real bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:50:28
why do you keep sucking mcaffe's dick then?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:27:34
thats speculation though.
we accept the answers we like
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:40:18
BItcoin dreams to reach the scale size of eth.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:05:41
as long as fees are $20, no one's gonna use bitcoin to buy stuff
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:28:57
Shapeshift said that fees are too high and dont exchange less than $100 dollars.
People kept bashing shapeshift to implement segwit as it will lower the fees.
Shapeshift is the biggest segwit company, has been using shapeshift for 2 months, yet fees are so high, if you transact less than $100 you might not get them
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:35:49
shhh man otherwise you're out of the cult
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:09:26
Yeah sure. Paying $20 for transferring $20.
Sure seems like the future
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:40:57
what do you mean you have a lot?
on coinbase or your personal wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:06
shhh dont ruin the narrative man. only bitcoin is free all other coins are shills
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:05:34
how much did you pay? $20? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:55:19


thats exactly what a bubble looks like
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:16:09
What's so bad about bitpay?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:45
do you think we dont know the price?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:51:53
yeah sure keep living in denial.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:03:13
thank you for not circlejerking dude. Thank you
Also how did you miss this retarded statement of OP "until all fiat currency has collapsed around it."
fucking lol, all fiat will collapse? hahah
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:45:17
Im trying to do this also. 
how profitable it is?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:23:32
you know what would? 
stop believing in retarded nonsense conspiracy theories and start improving the tech 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:33:59
are you asking for logic in this sub??
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:20:29


There's substance behind them. Stock rises when new iPhone comes out. Stock falls if new Iphone is shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:58:28
why? how did the steal your money?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:31:02
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:37:33
why network is congested though?
there arent that many transactions. BTC does 300k tx per day. ETH does 1M and has fees at $0.8
this is not normal
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:33:38
this looks like a trump tweet
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:34:59
I know what inflation is.
One country is overinflated with money, 250 other countries are not.
Doesnt mean the economic system is not working
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:28:42
whats this got to do with bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:25:17
exactly like it was envisioned in the white paper
"Then Satoshi said: If you want a real peer to peer currency just use the other altcoins."
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:11:59
agree wholeheartedly.
90% of front page is dumb memes, they're not even funny.
Or shitty "funny threads" like:
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:42:05
because you are dumb as an 8ball?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:57
what can bitcoin do now that it couldnt 5 years ago when it was just $100?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:14
well good for them.
arent we all doing that? hoping to dump the coins someday to be millionaires?
they can do it now
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:56:39
bittrex has bcash too
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:32:06
Paypal has lower fees than bitcoin, and is faster. just saying
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:07:32
ETH is a PoW coin, has 1M tx per day, 3x moe than Bitcoin. Fees are 55x less.
 yet doesnt need it
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:55
fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:53:28
Finally a Bitcoin tip too yay
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:52:13
that applies to every coin

his travel expenses are paid by the conferences. his hotel too. he just goes from city to city to talk
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:35:15
first of all, block your credit card with your bank. til you figure this out
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:18:23
with these high fees, nobody's gonna use bitcoin as a currency.
I bought a domain with BTC. Never again. Paid like $8 fees for a $40 purchase
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:06:20
not that clickbaity.
ive been following this guy. he knows what he's talking about. he invested 500k in eth when it was like $0.1
His exact words were: "of course bitcoin is going to crash, but Im gonna make money on the way up"
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:22:26
I think it was. Maybe Im wrong
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:09:49
read the article.
all these forks are diluting the brand name "bitcoin"
there's bitcoin, cash, godl, diamond, etc etc.
Bitcoin is worth 100b, but bitcoin cash is 25billion and so on.
this oversupply
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:21:32
you can do that with paypal too
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:11:32
literature is not a science either but there's a nobel prize
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:25:11
I dont love seeing old articles about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:57:06
you wont find it here.
99% of posts is memes, roger ver dae devil, jamie dimon dae evil, ATH wohooo, HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:29:47
Bitcoin will never replace fiat
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:02:35
thats what the article said, not me.
besides you know very well that dollars to bottle caps is not the best analogy for btc to bch
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:49:40
keep in mind that the majority of users here are teenagers who think that by buying $20 of bitcoin they'll be billionaires tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:30:35
you wont become a millionaire 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:06:47
we know already
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:01:11
why do you have to antagonize a part of the community and potential users of your website? just for the lulz?
are you 14?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:21:40
yeah because this is the first time someone has said this.
first time ever.
no one else.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:01:13
yeah because Trump is very smart
