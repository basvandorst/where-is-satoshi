You can try cyrpto trade. 
They are listed on the stock exchange and the guy who runs it seems to have his shit together.  They also have an affiliate program.
Disclaimer: I own some shares!

Guess we'll see the block reward halving alot sooner than expected at this rate.  I didn't feel like waiting a full 4 years anyways. :)

Are they really that late?  Chip makers always have delays..  With bitcoin there are more time constraints so people get pissed alot faster.

Seems like if they were trying to scam folks they would promise something that stands out from the rest.  Basically they are offering nothing new as far as technology.  My sensors say no scam.

Dammit was expecting to sell some of my coins for a million dollars one day.  Another dream out the window.

People should actually be blaming themselves instead of Pirate.  a 7% return on your money every week and you thought it would go on forever? lol

Bitcoin is only 4 years old.  It's only gotten easier and will continue to get easier

No but they are keeping all that hashing power off the network while they mine.

I do trust some people with some things.  Can't imagine not trusting anyone ever.  
@_date: 2013-08-19 07:41:26
In that case it shouldn't have btc-e on there either.

Sounds like an infomercial.

Do you have any proof russian taxes go towards russia today?  I just know Glenn Beck called out how it was a state run propaganda station a few years back and the hot hostess did a piece refuting his argument.

You mean bitcoin people go out in the sun?
@_date: 2013-07-22 01:58:39

Everyone in the back of their minds know there is only a fixed amount though, no matter what the current inflation rate is.

I dont know much about hashes, but will the same ASIC miners still be effective if the hashing algorythm is changed?
