more like whales are trying to shake the new investors (everything &gt;10k) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:48:46
nice. 384,400 is the next target then. After that Mars 54.6 Million? I mean really that is just another 182x from Moon.  lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:54:36
yeah and this i a log scale. we have not seen anything in BTC yet (btw BTC is not the bubble here. fiat is)
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:53:13
HODL = I only put in money that I don't need for the next couple of years. Nobody can shake me out of my position until I decide to sell -  no matter how hard others try to cause market crashes
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:20:56
Just check out the prices of the past. There have always been downturns. Cryptocurrencies sometimes go down or don't move at all for months and the move up 10x or more within a week. The trick is not to miss the up days.

FUD alert. they just have to apply consumer protection rules
"The financial authorities have decided to illegally exchange exchanges for buying and selling virtual coins such as bit coins. Adhering to some consumer protection provisions will allow you to operate exceptions. "
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:18:02
going down is good on a logarithmic scale.. will make it grow even faster later.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:25:06
I'm not impressed
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:40:41
I'm a mere mortal. Someone with more skills should make this happen please.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:09:17
there was a lot of coordinated FUD in the media today
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:55:24
2 minutes that is
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:30:02
haha so true

(not confirmed yet.. just a proposal)
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:33:33
pretty much what I'm trying to say is why wait and risk it? Let's make it quantum before the problem occurs.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:44:09
Why is changelly not on the list? I imagine them causing a lot of single bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:25:41
2 weeks everybody was all hyped up about it. What changed? I'm mean what really changed except for a lot of FUD? Nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:59
seems like a big deal to me
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:23:33
then everything would be fine I guess. Otherwise if big miners aquire that technology that would destroy the entire balance. From then on they would solve every single block.
Or what if someone can just calculate the seeds for the adresses and take the bitcoin from other people without breaking the network?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:36:10
I'll help you. Let's do this

To really go up with force past 20k it has to come down a little bit. It's natural. Just hodl
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:30:14
BCash is also myspace. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:54:46
just check out the REKT channel on twitter. some people apparently don't need the money 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:30:38
meh. we shall see

yeah half marathon and marathon
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:30:53
nobody knows but I think it would help to read what the authors at CME think about it
2 very good articles
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:19:15
there is no such thing as bad advertising for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:18
the best of luck to you

that's the dream
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:01:27
none of that is in the new tax bill that took like one year to make and just passed Congress. There won't be any new legislation after this for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:34:16
So you are happy with the current speed of the network? I see
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:57:19
Who didn't expect anything like that? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:38:04
Just make new addresses in a new wallet and transfer your BTC
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:51:43
HODL. just ask yourself. do you think bitcoin will be worth more  year from now, 3 years, 5 years?
If one of those replies is YES then why sell?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:34:42
maybe people exporting to korean exchanges for arbitrage
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:59:01
someone share this with Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:20:36
I believe that the biggest protection against big banks shorting Bitcoin is the Wall-Street traders themselves because I'm pretty sure most of them own at least some crypto in their private portfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:31:56
let me guess.. it didn't go up during that one hour? You should think in longer timeframes than 1 hour. Start with years 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:49:08
could Lightning network in theory be used to transfer money between the big exchanges? That would immediately bring the spread between exchanges down to almost 0
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:52:12
yeah but at least that means people didn't convert back to fiat right?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:03:47
they might use bitcoin to hedge against fiat inflation (=rising value).. or they might play games shorting and manipulating the price down (including rises when they load up for their quick dump to cause unexpectedly strong crashes ).
... nobody really knows. This is obviously not financial advise.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:47:13
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:02:53
couldn't care less. What happens today, tomorrow, next week or next month or in 3 months doesn't matter to me. I'm more interested in +3 years / +5 years + 10 year kind of thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:20:40
validate first, then send you money
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:29:12
true hero right there
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:01:57
fiat is the only thing you should not hodl
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:34:08
This also will be overcome. All these dips and recoveries just make bitcoin stronger in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:27:44
Setwit4x. Now!
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:36:21
and why would anyone try to sell all 100k BTC at once? They would make a lot less money that way
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:55:56
but Wall Street can trade on CME
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:30:37
But the adresses are still generated from the same seeds. Everybody would need to evacuate his bitcoin to the new "safe" adresses. That will take some time. Especially with slow transaction times right?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:00:54
then we should also add cryptocurrencies, ethereum, ETH, BTC, IOTA,  Litecoin, LTC, Ethereum classic, ETC, Monero etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:12:04
If I were you I would sell exactly when it is back at $19000 to be even - that way he can never complain about you making more money from it. Just buy a different one after that if you want.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:48
We understand why you do it. It's called gambling. You could also call it greed. I'm happy for you that it worked this time. Reality is though that it is incredibly hard to time the market. Most people lose money doing it because the market can stay "irrational" longer than what makes sense to you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:45:00
that's no exactly what I saw. Usually when BTC really goes down the alts go down even harder. not this time
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:34:01
I'm not very worried. If it goes down enough I will buy more.
