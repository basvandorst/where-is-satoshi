I still prefer Doffr (doffr.com) for getting Bitcoin tips on my blog, it's sexier and it's been there for a few months, not sure why Coinbase keeps on making everything seem like they invented it...

There is also doffr.com, about 6 months old.

THIS is the problem with Bitcoin - people focusing their energies on solving the wrong issues because of ignorance. Poor people in emerging markets don't care about what their government does with money, inflation, tax etc. All they care about is feeding their family tomorrow. And even if they did care, there is no way that with no leverage or wealth they can influence government decisions about how money is used. NO WAY. Add on top of that the most important thing: even 5% volatility in BTC can make the difference between feeding or not feeding your child tomorrow. There is no incentive for these people to use Bitcoin, not even in the slightest. Adding a Bitcoin wallet to a Nokia whatever phone is a total waste of time and energy. Bitcoin can do big things for people in emerging markets but this is not it, and people in the Bitcoin community need to start understanding this very quickly. (FYI I grew up in these markets and know them pretty well) Just some food for thought...

Couldn't agree more. The level of ignorance of how 'Bitcoin can change Africa' is absolutely astounding. The MPESA example is 10 years old and it didn't work anywhere else in Africa, it is a complete anomaly. Not to mention the fact that people's families might actually die if they lose a small % of their 'wealth' ie. volatility in BTC is a total non-starter for the unbanked in Africa. Then we have distribution issues, connectivity issues, educational issues... the concept of crypto can potentially have a huge impact in Africa, but not in the way most outsiders think. We will get there - but let's just focus our energy on dealing with the right issues, not the self righteous ones. (source: extensive experience in Africa + Bitcoin)

And what exactly will someone that can only afford a $29 phone do with Bitcoin? 
(I am a Bitcoin fan so playing a bit devil's advocate here but it's important for people to be realistic about Bitcoin's use by low income groups - so would really like to hear what people think)

To make it worth their while these Abra 'tellers' will have to process quite a bit of transactions = carry a lot of cash = painting a bullseye on your head for robbery (especially in emerging markets) - now the robbers can even find your exact location on the app! 
There is a reason why money services businesses dealing with cash are centralised in a building, it's not because they are lazy, it's for security. 
Also there is a cost to carry all this cash and the poor man on the street doesn't even know how this works: his 0.5% fee might actually be a -1% fee. 
And of course the risk of arrest for money laundering.
It's pretty clear who the winners and losers are in this system.

Pity it's all getting lost in the bottom threads, below all the 'this seems huge to me' messages.

Hahaha great!

Yes we are not saying it won't work, just saying there are risks associated with it too and these need to be discussed as well, instead of just saying 'ah it's Bitcoin, it's going to make everything better'

Now that you mention Uber, if they built Abra with a very clear exit strategy in mind (e.g. flip it to Uber in 12 months) I can see something here - Uber drivers already make money so this is just incremental so can carry less cash, maybe a bit safer in the cars with people's locations and some soft KYC via people having to register for the Uber app, could even allow Uber to get people to pay for cash in rides in emerging markets which is a big problem for them. So for a quick flip to the right partner it could be an interesting play.
