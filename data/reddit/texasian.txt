How many more? A couple thousand maybe? That's chump change to any top tier cellphone manufacturer. I think you're caught in the r/bitcoin echo chamber.

No, if you don't have a 'valid' shipping address it errors out. If you go through overstock with a gift card or cc order, the form validations would have caught my mistake with the zip+4. Using Coinbase, it bypasses those checks.

Coinbase needs to fucking make sure their integration doesn't fuck up merchant form validation.
Somehow my auto fill decided to enter my zip+4 rather than just my zip in overstock. Normally this isn't an issue, but for whatever reason, when paying with bitcoin, the form validation skips. It allows me to pay and then spits me back out saying that there was an issue (due to an invalid zip code for the billing or shipping address).

I wonder if this has been in the works for a while, or if the MIT news helped move it forward.

Any chance you can get your hands on some pomelo tea? I've been searching for a good source of it in the US for a couple months now...

Kind of a pity that you'll still need to give them a credit card for incidentals though.

There are a couple of businesses around MIT that already accept Bitcoin, hopefully 
Also, the Co-op just put in a liberty teller ATM this week. Not sure if it's par for the course, but they also had a wallet generator right next to it.

Overstock definitely did a good job about this. If you ring up CS with a bitcoin issue, tier one directs you to payment specialists who have been trained to deal with Coinbase issues.

I would love to see a pissing contest between all of the different crypto subreddits to see who can be the most charitable.

Or Foodler.

Except it hasn't. Apple has continually sold more iPhones with each and every new release (not sure how the 5c is holding up, but anyways). Them selling tons of phones hasn't changed. What HAS changed is the smartphone market. It's grown by leaps and bounds, and Apple's percentage of that has been shrinking, but that isn't due to them selling fewer phones.

Kind of annoying that they only go up to $500, but I guess that's good enough for most domestic flights.

I'm excited to see what's going to happen in Cambridge and the Boston area. I'm hoping for mass merchant adoption, at least in the areas adjacent to campus.
That said, I wouldn't be surprised if a large number of students just end up spending the bits on foodler.

    *10% discount or lower ensures that your order will be purchased by a VIP member with Prime
Is Purse aware that Prime Day discounts are only available to members who have Prime? Somebody should make them aware.

And we dropped from 250 to ~110 in a day.

No, and we know that. The problem is, too many people don't give a shit. Those that do care are usually the servers themselves, who probably have more pressing immediate concerns. On the flip side, how would restaurant owners cope? In some states, their direct payments to servers would more than triple overnight (for instance, Texas' hourly tipped wage is $2.13. Federal minimum wage is 7.25). This would require many business owners to cut back on worker's hours and the number or servers in their employ.
If they don't do that, how do the recoup the costs? Most likely raising prices, considerably. Honestly though, the system works quite well. If you provide good service, you'll typically get better tips. If you stick with it, you can work your way into nicer and nicer restaurants. Honestly, if you're at a fine-dining place, you can make a decent living wage off of your tips.

No, but giving a blanket gift to everybody shows you didn't put much thought to the selection. The price of the gift doesn't matter, just the thought and intention behind it. If everybody had expressed interest in BTC? Sure, do it. Otherwise, it's just going to end up being a hassle for everybody involved. I'd much rather give presents that the recipient would use.

I just wish y'all could factor in promotional codes into the prices. I purchased an espresso machine through y'all, but could have saved 10% had I purchased using fiat and the sign up promotional code they sent me.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:45:17
Varies by the state buddy. There's no universal rule that applies across the board. On unexpectedly quiet nights, it's not unusual for servers to get cut far before closing. Didn't make the equivalent minimum wage? Tough shit.
Does the situation suck? Yeah, but it's the way things work for now.

Mass drop is slow, but it's because they have to order the stuff directly from he manufacturing once the drop ends. They don't have the stuff in stock.

Now, if 7-11 would start accepting Bitcoin at it's iBon kiosks, now THAT would be a watershed moment. You can pay for ANYTHING using iBon.
