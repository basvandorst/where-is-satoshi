Pdf's were saved to downloads folder, and copied into folder sitting on the encrypted drive.  Encrpyted drive is mounted and dismounted before shutting down the computer or when not in use.

This was certainly my thought as well but I scanned several times with multiple virus/malware scanners and I reviewed rootchk processes to find something, anything but alas nothing was discovered.  I'm also on a Mac.
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:31:15
Yes I know :)   
I swept the keys and moved all funds to my electrum wallet, then sent coin back to the paper wallet.  Used the funds on my electurm wallet.  Electrum wallet funds were never touched.    
2 days after moving funds back to the paper wallet, they were stolen at a time I was sleeping, computer off in my bedroom. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:25:06
sadly I see the coins going to 3 other wallets before settling in a final wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:55:05
it was firefox and not chrome, and yes https was on.  Nobody has access to computer. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:38:54
I don't use that VPN, but regardless of which VPN can you tell me why that would be factor, (can you ELI5 it for me?)
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:33:11
I don't think so, I think this warning was set up for partial payments sweeping the entire wallet and having the change go missing, early on in the bitcoin days.  
There might be something to reusing a paper wallet many times with the same private key, but this was swept only twice so I'm inclined to believe this was not the source of the hack.
@_date: 2018-10-17 04:13:02
true that
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:06:30
I'm equally as suspicious.  The one that was jacked had the most, but the other two still had significant amounts, certainly worth the 60 seconds to steal.    
The one that was stolen from I had only sent coins to once before, so I doubt I ever checked it as it was a new wallet.  
The ONLY time I ever scanned the private key for the wallet that was stolen from was to sweep my btc into an electrum wallet.  I did this with multiple wallets and no other wallet was stolen from.  And yes it's the latest electrum downloaded from the legitimate site.  Never any issues before with either electrum or these paper wallets and presumably if it were an electrum issue they wouldn't leave btc kicking around on that wallet either.     
I thought about that as well but the funds were jacked 2-3 days after I'd made a big deposit onto that wallet, which was 6 weeks after I created that wallet and for half the time the wallet was in existence, it had more than a worthy amount to steal.

Thanks for the explanation.  I don't think however these were "weak keys" - they could have been keys the site owner has pre-programmed, sure but I did use the RNG on the site.   
Also answered the other post:) 
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:38:19
yup, so it says, however site ownership did change hands not long ago and the new owner is very potentially the culprit. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:19:03
I get what you're saying, but a key logger would leave some evidence and I'm not turning up anything.  I know what to do in the future but I'd really like to determine exactly what the cause was in this case.  Thoughts?  Can a key logger escape multiple virus scans on a mac?  If so how would I rule this out with certainty ?

paper wallets created end of august, coins sent to them in September, coins stolen early October.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:24:33
Created the pdf file by clicking print then save as pdf, nothing was ever printed.    
No could storage device or accounts ever linked so likey not that one.   
Lets say it created a "weak key" - how would one exploit this and how would one determine if a key is weak or strong?  I did use the random number generator on the website and moved my mouse around the screen until complete.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:16:16
Thanks for the questions, data was never copied and nobody else had access to the hard drive.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:29:38
I don't think it was related to that, this root hack was sept 2017 and my OS was updated regularly since then.  The hack was this past month.
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:42:08
swept other keys from other paper wallets at the same time, none were affected (I've since stopped using those paper wallets).   
Electrum wallet was triple checked 6 months earlier when I had first heard about the phishing sites with the fake installs. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:20:28
appreciate the help regardless :)
@_date: 2018-10-18 07:34:46
might be the case...
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:25:31
wasn't saying it as an extra level of protection, saying FWIW as far as diagnosing any issues.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:31:27
Only 3 virus scanners and one malware specific scanner, all very credible companies, and only had one scanner I was using previously before the hack.   
How trust worthy is my forensic specialist?  We'll find out, I haven't used them before so the hack wouldn't have come from them.

Sounds like your friend was in a similar situation, it sucks :(    
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:03:55
sadly :(
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:13:09
coins were moved from the other wallets the moment I realized it.  But how would my private key be compromised for saving it on my computer?  Please explain.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:22:18
nope, never scanned the private key with my phone. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:34:10
relates to a 'change deposit' issue in the earlier days of bitcoin, I don't think it relates to my situation.  I only swept the keys from this wallet once and I sent the full amount.
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:37:52
fair enough, I agree that Macs are by far immune :)    
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:20:52
Would this explanation change at all if the wallets were created while using the TOR browser?  There's a chance it was either while connected to VPN, VPN+TOR or just TOR.      
I agree with you on hacking my computer itself.  If that were the case they would need a screen logger or keylogger to have seen or read the private keys.  The wallet files aren't even saved using the word "wallet".

Followed the instructions by moving the mouse around the box
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:36:58
a good solution for the future but sadly does not address how the attacker bested me in this situation.
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:35:08
At the time the stolen key was generated, 2 other paper wallets were generated at the same time, a few minutes apart.  All the private keys were different.  No physical copies were ever made, nobody but me has computer access.
@_date: 2018-10-18 07:35:08
sending you a pm
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:48:26
haha, that should have read "I agree that Macs are far from immune".  The ghost of S Jobs lives in my keyboard.
