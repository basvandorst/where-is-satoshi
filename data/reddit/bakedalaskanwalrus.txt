First off, welcome to the bitcoin world!  Glad you figured out how to purchase bitcoins and made the jump, thats a bigger investment than 90% of people out there right now (even if its only 0.005btc)!  If you have the time to day trade, you could try transferring the bitcoin into an exchange and test your luck as the price swings up and down.  If you're just interested in owning bitcoins, I would say hold onto it.  There's a lot of future bitcoin potential!

Well currently stocks are priced in USD and you can trade USD on forex exchanges with other currencies.  It simply isn't as volatile as Bitcoin.  So a company that offered stock in Bitcoin would have to account for the fact that the price of Bitcoin could skyrocket or plummet.  Not taking into account the performance of a company, the company would be worth a lot more (in USD) now compared to a year ago if it was valued in Bitcoin.

I don't see it happening.  There is so much money invested in the stock market it dwarfs bitcoin in comparison.  Save the stock market crash for the failures of the US dollar.  But I love the shift in trust from corporations to a digital currency.  I only hope that those investing aren't simply trying to make a quick dollar and move on.  Seems like those that are really interested in investing should hold onto their stock in profitable companies like google and apple and then additionally invest in bitcoin.
