As another app developer I can confirm this
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:52:06
I didn't think this would actually happen. Holy shit.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:11:30
That's great :) good to hear
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:53:34
Hes probably lying...

It's quite tough to make an educated guess, but I'm betting on $950 :)

This. They're just covering it up because of the bad pr. Just wait a few months and this stuff will be all over @_date: 2014-01-23 13:15:20

Then we wouldn't even need USD, you can just use BTC :P
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:40:31
Worthless? Tell me again how 1000 doge is worthless?
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:10:52
Hey. You can start out by getting a wallet, which just basically will hold all your bitcoins and you can send/recieve with it. I recommend Electrum, it's safe and easy to use and doesn't take a toll on your computer.
After you have your wallet set up, you can buy some bitcoin from an exchange. If you live in the US, try Coinbase. It's technically not an "exchange" but you can buy and sell bitcoins there. You do have to verify a bank account and it will take like a week or two. It might seem tedious but it's actually really easy!
Good luck!

Every time the price drops someone attempts to calls the bottom. And they are wrong 99% of the time.

Does this mean China's coming back? I thought users couldn't buy any more, only sell?

So is the stock market also a pyramid scheme? It's more profitable to be an early adopter of Tesla stock.

Early adopter comic:
EDIT: My (true) sob story is that I've been mining for a month and made only 0.04309643 BTC. Which is like $18. :(
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:33:12
That is the suggested operational procedure, but make sure you dissolve the cloud first, and then pour it in increments. You don't want it to condense on your toilet and have it overflow.
@_date: 2014-01-01 22:03:30
Well, it would be more like, "Back in my day, some people used to own thousands of mBTC"

@_date: 2014-03-24 20:00:18
Man, I remember in November I think it was, I JUST found out about bitcoin, and some guy was saying the exact same thing that you are right now, except instead of $1260 it was $230. I doubt he regrets buying at $230 now :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:08:35
Wow!!! Thank you so much! You just made my friday way better :D
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:30:33
Wow, that's surreal with your roommate. I really do think bitcoin will go above $1260, like you said it's the same people that were arguing and saying that the previous tops were the highest the price would ever go. A lot of people think that they didn't get on the boat early enough but in my opinion I think there's still time. I was going to get in around thanksgiving 2013 also, but since I was 15 at that time (now 16) I didn't have the necessary bank information to confirm my account for Coinbase so I just said fuck it, and gave up. Big mistake, but I did get in after the price soared to around $700 and I'm still holding and I don't regret it.
In my opinion I believe Bitcoin is here to stay. If it's "too fragile" like some people say, I think it would already have been gone a while ago. Of course governments and politics pose a threat, but from what we know, the US government doesn't seem to be anti-bitcoin as of now, which is good.
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:05:10
Lol I'm not trying to be a dick head, but everyone in this thread is looking through rose tinted glasses. Bitcoin has its obvious flaws and is not perfect and is far from the average joe buying and actually using it everyday over a credit card or cash. The ops entire post is fucking ridiculous and if you can't see the flaws with his post then you need to step back and think about it. I own Bitcoin myself and I think it's awesome but it's obviously not perfect and everyone getting hyped up off this guys post shows how cynical this subreddit is
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:39:22

I second this. Could anyone start a fund or get in contact with him?

@_date: 2014-01-25 02:17:47
He also has a Tesla

No no, I think you have to put your whole computer into the toilet. To destroy the evidence.

I love it! It brings a new look and feel to the usual bland look of wallets. I think it will be welcoming for new users.

It isnt difficult at all. When you connect a bank account you just wait 2 or 3 days for it to get verified. Only after your bank account is connected can you buy coins. You get locked in at the price you buy the coins. I didn't need an ID or home utility papers
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:05:14
Yes. When I first registered for coinbase in late november I think, I bought 1 coin at $700 and by the time I got it it was worth like $850-900. You're locked in at the price you click purchase at
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:22:52
Just turned 16.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:50:47
Yes, it was simply the easiest and most secure way for the average joe to store and spend money online. Bitcoin can be both of those things, but it is not at this moment. We need to make things easier for the average joe. Think about it, why would someone bother to learn about, acquire, and then secure some amount of Bitcoin (who's value can fluctuate greatly at any time)  if they can use an easy and quick method that doesn't involve all this complex stuff and not to mention, risk?
Just food for thought. We as a community should put our heads together to solve these issues and make it easier and safer with clear advantages over traditional money processors like PayPal. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:34:43
Ahh okay.
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:26:52

"prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans."
Oh, I guess people who own bitcoin in America aren't hard working. Nice.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:29:44
This might be a stupid question, but let's just make a proposition. Say I had like 1000 BTC, and I wanted to sell them at a profit. Since that is a large chunk of change to pay taxes for, could I move to Denmark for a few months and cash out, then come back the US with that money?
@_date: 2014-01-18 14:40:27
That's a good question. I would think that for them, it is easier to mass-produce many units and then just sell them off, rather than rent out a warehouse or something and set them up. Also they most likely don't want to deal with the difficulty going up.
So yeah I think you're right in your post.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:12:02
Hmm, I'm not sure. How about June 15th? Pretty random date but that is around the time my summer vacation starts from school. I'm hoping for a bull run around that time.

@_date: 2013-12-26 19:15:01
Yeah it looks like it would be worth it, but mine LTC instead of BTC. You will make more profit. Also make sure you know how everything works and make him show you
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:09:27
But that isn't a currency that fluctuates.. That is population, which means that the more people that exist, the more people will be born. Bitcoin doesn't function like that.

If anything, dogecoin makes it a ton simpler to get into cryptocurrency. It's very forgiving and the community is welcoming and nice. Unlike where if someone comes into its completely serious and does not seem welcoming at all. Most people here have an elitist attitude
