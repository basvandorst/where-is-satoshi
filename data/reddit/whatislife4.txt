History shows it will always go back up. You have an incredible asset, I would hold on to it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:11
It will go back up. This is just the start.

Do you have a bank account? Why trust a bank with your money instead of keep it all in cash? Sounds like an IOU to me. You're not completely wrong, but I think my suggestion is practical.

I've been using Coinbase since 2012 and have never had an issue. As long as you have a good password and enable 2-factor authentication there is no reason to be worried. If you believe that Coinbase can be hacked or the Government will find a way to shut it down, then sure, your own Blockchain wallet is more secure. Not worth the fee for a small amount, though. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:08:24
It depends on how long you are willing to hold on to it.

When the price is this volatile does anyone really notice a fee?

January 1st 2017 I made a New Year's Resolution to auto-buy $20 a week and to not touch it for at least a year. That has turned in to roughly $1,900 now. Best decision I ever made. And it's great because you don't have to think about it and you barley notice $20 out of your paycheck.

[Electrum]( is easy to use.

Use a paper wallet and stash it in an old piggy bank that you have to break.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:22:28
I haven't used anything else except for Circle, which you can no longer use to buy and sell. I've heard Kraken is good. You can use the Coinbase wallet, but there is a slight risk since they technically own your Bitcoin. They could go out of business and walk away with your coin, get hacked, etc. I'm sure it's safe but for the "you never know" aspect, it's better to have your own wallet on your computer. Or a paper wallet you can keep in a safe place.

It feels like New Year's Eve or something

No exchange account necessary. Coinbase is fine to buy, just store the bitcoins on your own wallet instead of leaving it in Coinbase for the long term. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:34:51
I think there will always be a lot of resistance at $1,000 because newcomers will think one Bitcoin is "so expensive" and be turned away from buying. Even though you can buy fractions of a Bitcoin, something about the thousand dollar mark makes it seem different. If some day it rallies past $2,000 then maybe that won't be an issue anymore, but until then I think there is a tough wall ahead.

That's like asking where can I get a cheap $20 bill.

Looks like the website is suspended.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:08:31
This is perfect.

Depends how long you wait.

Isn't it a great feeling? Even understanding how Bitcoin works, making a purchase really makes it click. This is easy. This makes sense.
@_date: 2016-10-25 13:27:29
So is this your website?
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:41:41
If you have two-factor authentication on everything important, smart passwords, and be careful what you click on you should have no reason to be worried. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:26:16
I transferred 1 BTC from Coinbase to Circle today and made like $15 in the process.
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:52:30
Good day fine sir.

Either A) It takes some time, I've seen it come through an hour later. B) The credit card declined because of "unusual activity" and you may get an email or phone call to confirm that you've made the transaction. Coinbase will eventually show it as a failed transaction.

One that it will still require a reference to the US dollar (or whichever currency the users country uses), and the value of that is it's own market where value can go up and down. Two I'll always need an app to figure it out, instead of being able to causally talk about it. "Hey, let's all put in $5 for pizza vs Hey, let's all put in...hold on... .0002 bitcoin in for pizza.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:58:02
Nope. Just have to wait. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:17:45
Maybe my point is too hard to understand. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:27:36
Did you pay with a bank account or credit card? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:40:22
Ah, that works! I was expecting the word paper wallet import spelled out for me but didn't realize it works like that. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:43:45
My point would be that it may hinder adoption for the average person and is an added point of confusion when trying to explain Bitcoin to someone. I mean I get it, it's like learning a new language. It just seems like it's not as easy as it could be.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:10:12
My point is that clearly someone said that should be the target.
