Canadianbitcoins.com as well is an option to sell

...that can't be manipulated, edited or changed.  The point is that Bitcoin is DEcentralized...

Depends how long you wait to cash out. If you hold the coins for over a year and it's more of an investment it's long term capital gains tax. If you're using it as income I'd say it would be taxed as typical income tax. 
Don't actually know for sure though. 
What set up do you have to mine? How much?

You clearly don't know much about Bitcoin at all dude... hardware wallet... seed recovery... paper wallet... all solutions that solve your issue of loss.  I'm sure in the future there will be companies that make it even simpler than it is and possibly offer some sort of insurance

fuck, seriously.  $100 worth of bitcoins would be worth $75M today?  Unfortunately I can't stop myself from thinking about what it would be like to be in that position...

You're saying you actually have 5000 BTC or this is hypothetical? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:21:03
Perhaps. $50/week? Nice

That's 40x the current price.  The marketcap would be approx. 1.5 trillion?  Is that realistic?

Capital gains tax if you sell to USD
How'd you mine the BTC? Recently or years ago?
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:44:46
I have no idea...

So your main return of 70% is coming from cryptos? How do you propose timing dips? This seems far fetched and unrealistic doesn't it? Why not just buy and hold? 
If you're starting with $5k and AAPL returns you 30% YoY that would mean you need even more than 70% return guaranteed on cryptos. 
Is it really this simple? Seems too good to be true.

Orders for Ledger now are shipping in September... I'm assuming the Amazon ones will ship a lot faster.

Is this legit? Anyone else have experience? Seems wayyyy too good to be true.

He's not smart enough

So does this mean I should install core twice? How do you go about running both?
