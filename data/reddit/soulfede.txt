Nothing really.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:31:58
It is never going through.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:45:14
Nope. 0.25% fee across the board for trades on Bittrex.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:04:21
LOL, ok man! Enjoy!
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:33:02
When this happened to me last month, it just got dropped after like ten days and back into my wallet. Thank God.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:22:10


Oh, boy...
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:33:48
People refusing to acknowledge problems is a big part of this. You're completely right.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:08:17
Ding ding ding ding
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:25:34
It's stuck. Gotta wait till it gets dropped probably, which is going to take up to two weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:07:42


It's not that simple OP.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:14:11
Yeah, running a prison is probably not as easy as you think it is lol.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:16:50
Bitcoin's ledger is completely open and public, literally anybody can see every single transaction ever made.
What are you talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:30:58
Crypto was never about "social equality", I honestly have no idea where you got that.
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:18:32
You could try transaction accelerator services, but it's very unlikely that you'll manage to get in. My transaction was stuck for ten days before getting dropped and back into my wallet. This was back in mid December. 
Also might be relevant to say that I do not own any Bitcoin anymore; I got out right before the big correction started.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:28:44
Well, I am a Nigerian Prince and would like to talk to you.
(Last time I jokingly said this, the guy actually PMd me. Pls don't.)
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:43:46
Coinbase is not the problem here.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:13:13
They do. Mine did after a dozen days.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:44:44
The LN network is an off-chain solution; that means that in order to transact on it, you need to make an actual (potentially slow/expensive) on-chain transaction first to open a payment channel.
After this, the funds you sent on the LN are locked in there until you close the channel - this requires another on-chain transaction.
In order to avoid having to open a new channel every time you want to transact with a different individual/shop/whatever - which would of course defeat the purpose of the tech - various payment channels are linked to each other, so that if you're linked to B and need to send a payment to C, you can do that if B and C are also linked with each other.
In order for this to work, the linked hubs you hop through need to hold big funds (the bigger and well connected the hub, the more funds it needs to hold). This makes the hubs very expensive to run.
Not going to keep writing the essay now, you can read all about it on the internet. 
Did you know any of this?
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:34:23
Not "FUDing". It really is not that simple.
But hey, you can keep blindly regurgitating oversimplifications if you want. Doesn't affect me really.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:23:49
It's almost like he has the connections to know things we don't...amazing...
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:15:07
Well, when people think they're getting decentralized, p2p, cheap electronic cash, and instead they get something that gets stuck for weeks on end unless you pay a huge fee, and is mostly in the hands of a handful of huge Chinese mining farms, they tend to be disappointed. Also LN looks dubious in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:44:21
It's really not that exciting if you go any further than the "OMG LOOK AT THIS HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION" videos.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:21:25
Have you actually withdrawn the USD or just sold the BTC on the exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:38:45
I think OP is not aware of DAG, since he only mentions Blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:55:38
Yeah, it's definitely not that so many people are losing faith in Bitcoin. That's impossible, must be something else.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:12:40
Yes, actually. If your transaction fee was too low it will not ever be picked by miners and will be stuck in limbo for up to two weeks. Happened to me.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:01:44
If you "know" it's gonna pop, do you not think they're going to be a step ahead of you?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:27:09
Of course it's not organic, but general sentiment still amounts for most of the swings. Manipulators only act as catalysts.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:01:08
Up to two weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:10:06
Transaction fee is 5 Sat/B. It's never going through. All you can do is wait until it gets dropped by the mempool but that should have already happened. Luckily it's not a big amount of money.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:57:37


No. Also it was just an attempt to inform, since apparently many people think LN is some magical solution to every problem. 
Not contrarianism at all. Good thay you're already informed, we can move on.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:02:32
Nah not gone, it will get dropped by the pool eventually and back into your wallet. Might take up to two weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:08:28
Fuck off.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:40:20
Not only that. Mostly having a fast, reliable and cheap p2p electronic cash, which is what Bitcoin used to be.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:25:31
Yeah, in movies!
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:50:41
Hope you're larping man.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:25:26
Fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:43:51
I remember reading a post yesterday: this guy said that he also had BTC from way back, a promotion on Coinbase just like yours.
He said the BTC was flagged as "expired".
So maybe you needed to do some subsequent verification or something for it to stay in your wallet.
Not sure about this, just tryina help.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:53:35
I have no idea. A few hours after my comment it did a quick dip to about 12k I think but shot right back up to 15k.
Also, you dont't need to buy a whole coin. Very few people actually own a full one or more, the vast majority only buy fractions.
The % gain on your investment is going to be the same as everyone else's.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:24:04
ALL of it? Wow.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:15:31
Dude, it can't just move by 20% every single day forever.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:26:51
For sure.

Strap tight; I repeat, strap tight, the ship is about to take off.

Which hole are you pulling these numbers out of?
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:08:44
Mempool clogged. I also have a transaction stuck in there for almost a week now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:21:21
You'll need a supercomputer for these incredibly complex calculations.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:07:41
In order to understand that, try day-trading altcoins, only looking at the 15 minute chart.
Just a very small amount. You'll understand.
That's how confused they are when they blindly invest in this space without any previous knowledge.
Also personality traits.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:12:57
Do you think it would be feasible being stuck with a 6Mb/s internet connection?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:35:29
My wallet (Ledger Nano) doesn't even have that feature. 
Also what about my coins? Most of the BTC I own is in that stuck transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:54:19
What happens next will SHOCK YOU! (gone sexual) (gone wrong)
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:08:22
How is it more usable if you can't set transaction fees higher than 15 sat/B? (Speaking about the Nano S specifically, no idea about other wallets) Had I used Legacy, I could've set a higher fee and my transaction could've gone through.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:47:52
Just watched a guy explaining the basic "buy low, sell high" concept for 30 minutes while assuming that the upswing / downswing cycles in cryptocurrency pairs are regular and completely predictable.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:09:07
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:53:35
I get that feeling too. 
A bunch of alts are up 100-200% in the last few days...
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:03:24
Yeah, except Bitcoin can also adjust.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:37:54
Not gonna trick anybody. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:56:01
You sent your funds there without having a verified account in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:43
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WILL SHOCK YOU! (GONE WRONG) (IN THE HOOD)
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:52:57
Yeah, and now we're up 20x from the peak of that bubble.
Problem is, people keep using the term "bubble" as if if it pops, Bitcoin is done forever.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:03:33
Don't do it if you don't know what you're doing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:17:25
Not 100% sure myself, could be up to two weeks I think. I also lost a big opportunity because of this. 
Was my fault though, didn't check the mempool before setting my fee.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:17:11
I usually use cryptowat.ch or coinmarketcap.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:51:02
Yeah, it's still me. No problem there.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:51:14
Yeah but let's not forget that exchanges charge high fixed fees to withdraw. 
EDIT: not all of them of course.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:07:53
What do you mean it's stupid?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:02:37
Many universities for many years? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:15:33
I really hope so. Is it normal that I can still see it as unconfirmed on block explorers?
By the way, my Ledger wallet app doesnt show my full balance; it shows my full balance minus the stuck TX amount.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:10:50
I hate that imaginary person already.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:50:47
Very good post. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:35:11
Not a good sign in general.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:59:05
If you sent it to the right address, then it's going to that address.
I don't understand what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:40:09
There's more to it than just the price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:28:41
Zero confirmations, it's been almost ten days.

@_date: 2017-12-14 07:22:42
lol seriously?
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:39:15
You've been lured by the "invest $100, make millions in two years" thing with the spreadsheet.
It's all the same, they do what they do, and then some day they just go away with people's money.
If you don't care about losing that money go ahead and try, who cares; maybe it'll last long enough for you to make some more.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:24:43
Probably never going to go through. 
Mine was 15 sat/b and hasn't moved by an inch in 4 days.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:43:40
Do you guys seriously think anybody is going to fall for this and actually send you free Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:00:01
lol this is amazing
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:15:41
Nah, not lost. Either going through eventually or coming back right in our wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:10:06
I'm your friend, right OP? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:00:30
Okay but this still isn't a solution though.
People still can't buy small things with Bitcoin. They only can if they're buying from the same place(s) regularly.
For every new business you need to buy something from, you need to set up a payment channel, therefore having to make an actual transaction on the block chain.
You can't just stop at a shop and buy something with this.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:03:35
God, those emojis. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:11:20
My "high" fee setting from a SegWit Ledger was about $0.60. Needless to say, it's never going through.
On the other hand, I made a $10 fee transaction yesterday and it got confirmed within an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:08:44
Yeah, it makes sense to me as well. Of course we never know until it actually happens, but yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:19:13
Love this guy, has a link for everything
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:22:49
The system is clogged at the moment, it has been for a week already.
Consider yourself lucky if you pay $5 and it gets through in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:07:31
I've gotten through the dip to 3k (and the other ones) no problem, I was always confident in the bigger picture.
Right now though it feels different, maybe because I'm experiencing the limitations first hand.
Because of this, I also could not exit my position even if I wanted to, as my BTC is stuck in the mempool and has been out of my control for about ten days now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:04:49
Not twice the amount of BTC. When a hard fork happens, if you had your BTC on your own wallet at that time, you get an equal amount of the forked coin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:03:47
Sure. Also software wallets.
There are probably limitations to this, but generally speaking yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:37:07
It's not at all in their interest to steal your measly 17k worth of Bitcoin.
Wait till the holidays are over, the dust settles, and they're able to handle all the volume again.
Grab a drink and relax.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:49:05
Didn't write it down?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:56
Do you think the two situations are comparable though, with all the adoption - both by private individuals and big institutions - Bitcoin is getting at this very moment?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:16:06
Sorry about that. Sent the transaction FROM my Nano S.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:04:18
If you sent the BTC to the wrong address, then it's gone. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:48:20
Bots...no clue what they're trying to accomplish though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:37:58
Already dipped to 12-13k aand few days ago man.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:05:50
Yeah I can't really see any option for that on the app. Pretty annoying.
Also, is whoever uses SegWit basically doomed to have their transactions never go through? I mean, I get that the mempool is clogged right now, but what if it stays like this? SegWit unusable?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:33:44
How is it easy? Alt coins look completely fucking random to me lol.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:09:40
Why are you telling us this?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:04:35
Thanks for the answers, guys.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:58:38
Damn, I was already packing my stuff in order to move to Kyrgyztan.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:13:23
Fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:06:13
Yeah it's mine but it's out of my control since it's stuck in the mempool and there's nothing i can do.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:00:24


Wait, so you sold in the hopes of buying back in at a price 0.01% lower? What?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:49:13
lol that was brilliant
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:51:21
Same here, been using it for a little while and no issues at all so far, deposits ok, withdrawal ok, trading ok.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:45:18
I don't think they can make sure it gets through, unless they can increase the fee.
If it doesn't ever get through, it will eventually be rejected by the system and back into the sending address they go.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:53:34
I'm not that much of an expert at all actually, but yeah, the thing is nobody actually knows when/if they decide they had enough and just ghost. 
Might be around, yeah, who knows.
On the other hand, if you look at the charts, you'd be better off just buying and holding coins in the long run.
Even on websites like Bitconnect, people would have made more by just holding the coin and selling it later for a profit compared to their compound interest program.
Edit: unless you have an audience to exploit and make money off affiliate links.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:55:45
you'd get a good portion of that eaten up by spread and fees. You'd just be better off holding positions for longer.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:52:44
Right. Thank you for the answers, man!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:47:35
There you go.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:05:59
As a fellow European, that sounds pretty good. I hope they'll complete my verification soon and look forward to try them out!
Any idea if they don't allow access from certain countries IPs? I'll be in Thailand for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:58:37
Yeah, LocalBitcoins sees your geographical location and gives you a big list of people in your area selling or buying BTC.
You can then choose if you wanna meet in person or do it via bank wire. I'm pretty sure they have an escrow put in place to avoid scams, but I've never used it personally so can't vouch for it.
Coinmama, on the other hand, worked fine for me and got my BTC in a few hours paying with debit card. You're gonna pay a significant premium with them though (all included about 10%).
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:49:01
Your Ledger Nano only stores the private keys. It doesn't physically "contain" your BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:05:00
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:10:43
That isn't Bitcoin's fault.
You should read about the fees the exchange charges before using it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:13:30
I only see three options : High (fast confirmation), Standard (normal confirmation), Low (slow confirmation).
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:13:22
Somebody's totally gonna fall for this!
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:40:07
Agreed. Started to feel wrong when it passed 16k the other day. This is OK.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:12:38
No. You must have at least exactly 1.37100475 in order to be a real investor.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:13:43
Didn't you just make a post about that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:52:04
Yeah, I agree.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:49:53
Oh my God, SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:41:34
You should be able to claim the exact amount you had on a given wallet on the exact date of the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:01:36
Don't have my crystal ball with me at the moment. Will get back to you once I'm back in my spaceship later tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:57:07
Hey man. Be mindful, I wasn't implying that this is definitely going to happen. This is just an "IF".
No amount of math can tell you what is going to happen in the real world with certainty unless you know/control all the variables.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:17:10
Nobody wants to buy for any more than that price.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:00:33
I bought crypto with crypto.
Pretty neat.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:10:26
Hey man.
For your coin transfer, setting a low fee would mean waiting days for your transaction to be confirmed at the moment as the mempool is clogged.
Regarding the BCash (don't forget you also own BTG now!) yeah, once your Electrum wallet is empty and your coins are safe on your Ledger wallet, you can download the Coinomi app on an Android phone, set up a new wallet selecting BCash and BTG as coins you wish to use, then finally sweep the private keys from your old Electrum wallet for both BCash and BTG.
Voilà, now you got your forked coins as well.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:42:54
Nice crystal ball you got there, man!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:34:14


Or...many people are genuinely pulling out cause of the clogged network.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:59:37
My fee was around 50 cents, lol. Maybe tomorrow I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:37:51
Been trying for days. They're already full, pretty much at any time of the day, even if I try and spam it right on the hour.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:55:55
Oh yeah, that might be an option, although I heard some exchanges could freeze your account if they see you're using a VPN.
Also not the best option in terms of security?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:49:46
You'll do the same with the next crypto that has a green number next to it tomorrow. So doesn't matter really, you'll lose money either way with this mentality.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:22:45
You're a genius!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:44:08
Twelve year olds on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:05:40
Did you have your coins on your wallet at the time of the forks?
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:58:02
Not sure what you mean.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:23:07
Must've missed it somehow while setting the transaction, pretty unlikely that MY Nano S just doesn't have the option.
I don't know how the hell that happened. So now what, just wait until the network rejects it in 2 weeks?
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:41:38
I'm actually not sure about that.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:40:14
I'm ALREADY out.
At a pub. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:46:54
People have been saying the same thing for many years.
I think the burden of proof is on them.
Pro tip: there's no way to prove a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:51:55
"I HAVE INVESTED A WHOLE TWO DAYS AGO AND I AM NOT A MILLIONAIRE YET. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!"
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:03:13
Yeah you probably are screwed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:09:33
Just leave it, man. Buy your Xbox with your money and forget about Bitcoin for now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:24:47
Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:00:49
That's very subjective. People have different opinions on the matter, nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:42:31
Same exact situation as you, man. Been three days, but it's getting better, might go through tomorrow MAYBE if we don't get another huge spike. Otherwise just wait until it gets rejected lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:46:35
Everything isn't random, but in most cases our little minds can't really see what's going on, no matter how much we try to convince ourselves that they can.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:31
Fuck man, you have no idea how relieved I am right now.
It's been a tough 10 days. Thanks for your answers.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:04:55
Isn't it supposed to be rejected and back into your wallet after 2 weeks?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:06:28
Pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:28:10
Do not try to day trade with your non-existing knowledge on the matter, man. Just don't, it sounds cool and easy but the reality is very different.
You ARE going to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:13:50
What the fuck?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:42:18
You'll say the same exact thing a year from now when the price is much higher.
"Damn I was going to buy at 15k!"
Just buy if you wanna buy, man.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:02:04
I am not sure what you mean by that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:13:01
If the transaction is unconfirmed, your BTC is not in Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:34:17
I was actually sending to an exchange, but the moment has passed now so I don't need that anymore. I'm just going to wait it out, either goes through or gets rejected. Thanks for the answer though!
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:09:28
That's about a 3% price increase. Not unusual at all in this space.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:30:16
Oh, please.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:35:48
It kind of is, though. Only those who use and benefit from Bitcoin pay those fees.
Nobody forces anybody else to pay for it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:21:07
Wish I could. My BTC is stuck in the mempool. Fuck, this is bad.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:21:05

Fuckin junkie lmao
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:20:56
Damn, really? I bought mine from their website for about 50 bucks just a couple of weeks ago.

No begging here.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:28:49
lol ok!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:48:20
Forced to hodl either way cause, as I said, I'm in the same boat as OP and my BTC is stuck in the mempool :)
My butt is ready.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:26:06
That's weird. I withdrew BTC from Bittrex to my SegWit address no problem just a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:18:15
Hey, I moved about 3k worth of BTC yesterday using SegWit and only paid $0.60 in fees with the fastest possible transaction settings.
I'm still waiting for confirmation 30 hours later.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:14:12
Been waiting for about ten days here. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:39:34
HODL has been brought to a whole new level: now you're FORCED to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:11:01
I'm in the same boat. Unfortunately, Ledger Nano does not support fee changes after the transaction has been sent.
Just basically have to wait, it's either going through eventually or it's going to get rejected and back into your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:11:08
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:47:36
Ain't gonna click on that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:08:01
What do you mean "free"? Somebody's gonna have to pay for it, one way or another.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:49:39
I just applied for verification a few days ago. Nothing seems to be moving atm.
By the way, what about all the complains on the Bitstamp subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:29:34
I'm in the same boat, and for the first time, I have a really bad feeling about this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:51:00
Try other exchanges...depending on where you're from. You could try Coinmama which is more flexible (I bought from Thailand no problem) but applies very high fees.
Maybe try LocalBitcoins? Anything could work as long as you do a bit of research on the exchange beforehand. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:12:25
Oh, it's almost time to buy more then! Cool!
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:55:04

Fuck. Off.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:38:37
Yeah, same here. I was like "wait what?"
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:00:48
I'm afraid that's not very likely.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:30:51
Dude, why are you saying the exact same thing in every post. What the fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:27:49
BAN CHRISTMAS!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:54:36
About four months ago.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:50:01
I'm definitely going to click on that!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:42:30
Yeah it does, not gonna do that. Doesn't really matter that much anymore, since it was a time sensitive thing and it's too late anyway now.
So if it gets rejected, do my coins just automatically get back in my wallet or do I have to actively do anything? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:15:40
Inevitable you say.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:35:10
I kinda feel like a big dip is about to happen. What's been going on the last week price wise has been a bit too much in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:57:22
Thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:05:12
Fuck man, I'm happy things went relatively well for you.
Are you going to take legal action against the doctor(s) who left that piece of plastic in your pancreas, almost killing you?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:47:43
One address doesn't necessarily equal one person.
Those huge ones you see are usually represented by exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:27:11
Not stuck. It can either be successful or rejected, in which case your coins will be back in your wallet.
I'm on the same boat.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:47:58
No problem, you can set your fee lower and have your coins stuck forever! Awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:31:39
Yeah but I had many people tell me that after 2 weeks with no confirmations, it should be dropped by the mempool and go back into my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:09:10
Just connected my Ledger to Electrum and it shows my whole balance there, doesn't show that unconfirmet TX at all.
What is going on here?
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:41:37
It's completely possible lol. Might crash to 1k for all you know.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:26:21
Nothing's stopping you. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:52:37
Yup, for sure might happen. Just saying that if you're waiting too long for this dip, you might never see it!
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:19:14
Yup, let's see what happens!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:58:59
It just keeps getting worse and worse.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:42:41
Are you suggesting we apply a tax on the early adopters to "redistribute" Bitcoin to others?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:56:18
Playing it safe. I would've done the same last week if my transaction didn't get stuck (it still is).
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:59:55
I've used Bittrex for a couple of weeks, haven't had any problems at all.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:39:56
You seem to think that 5900 *must* be the bottom. Maybe you buy and it crashes to 2k within a month.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:22:34
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:05:16
So what happens to these transactions? Eventually dropped off the mempool?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:25:50
What's the point of putting an emoji after the word? Serious question, I don't get it. 
You already typed "world", why do you also have to show me a little picture of it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:41:55
You think creating a cryptocurrency is easy?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:27:13
Not even remotely possible.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:22:39
Almost a week here, nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:22:48
I wish after 3 days. Been waiting for fucking about 10 days now, still cannot access my damn BTC. Fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:15:44
What? I see no "custom" option at all. Where is it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:00:28
Not sure if serious, but "btc" is Bitcoin, while "bch" is Bitcoin Cash, or BCash.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:28:05
Quante assumptions in questo post.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:43
BRB, selling house.

Idk, sounds pretty scammy.

He doesn't have the slightest clue what he's talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:45:56
So you knew you couldn't send them to that address but you thought you were smart and sent them anyway.
Your coins are gone.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:41
Is it fast to get your coins in there in time of need, or is it like Bittrex, requiring 36 confirmations on their part before they actually allow to trade them?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:08:45
Probably not. I'd suggest a minumum of 200 sat/byte (should be about $10) right now in order to have it go through 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:46:16
Yup! You can get your Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:02:05
Any creator of a crypto will presumably be the first miner of said crypto, so he's going to have a BUNCH of coins for himself.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:02:11
I swear I'd like to see these people sometimes, just to see what face they have with that attitude.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:32:42


Yeah this seems very unlikely. Six months ago a $50 fee would have gone through instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:38:29
Up to two weeks I think :/
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:54:20
It all goes to me.

Buy a flat with 32k? What? Where do you guys live?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:50:03
Well, that's still pretty good. Everytime I hear people from other countries talk about apartment prices they're paying WAY less than I did.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:52:14
Yeah, THAT never happened! Amazing!
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:31:41
All right!
So, no risk of the VPN provider switching to an unwanted IP that would be seen as suspicious by exchanges?
Example: I choose to use a German IP, but for some reason it changes to an IP from Somalia ---&gt; my account gets frozen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:29:35
So wait, if I create a new transaction (maybe to the same address of the stuck transaction) with a high enough fee, both of them should go through?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:36:59
What do you mean "a Bitcoin name"? I don't get what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:55:42
It's broken, man. Keeps showing this weird word whenever I try to look at it. 
It keeps saying "HODL", whatever that means.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:42:35
Don't quote me on this cause I've never done this, but I'm pretty sure you can just send them to yourself.
Example: you wanna send your funds from segwit to legacy wallet ---&gt; go on your legacy wallet, see what your receiving address is, go back to your segwit wallet and make a transaction to your legacy wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:16:11

You're doing THE most hated thing here, basically begging.
I get that you're probably underage, but please try to understand that people do not like shameless self-promotion like this. 
Try to selflessly give before you selfishly ask when dealing with strangers.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:52:48
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:04:47
lol, this might be a surprisingly good question.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:10:34
Many people have firm belief on the future of this.
Many others are simply blinded by echo-chambers and quasi-religious mentality towards Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:16:28
I used SegWit from my Ledger Nano S.
What should I turn off exactly? I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:31:02

Good ol' Roger.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:52:22
When you own the private keys, you choose the fee. Nothing random or out of your control about it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:09:49
Depending on what fee you chose, it might never go through. What's your fee?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:14:11
Same shit is happening to me. Sent some with SegWit using highest fee available...it's been almost 36 hours and still unconfirmed.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:11:38
Delusions, yay!
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:00:07
He's implying that he can predict these markets. That's delusional.
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:17:42
Just stop man. Stop.

Taiwanese new year is just around the corner, then you're all gonna get rich after that. Guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:36:45
Very smart. Just keep throwing money at it, eventually it's going to be worth 100k each, no question about it. Personally, I am in the process of selling my apartment right now. See you at the top, fellow hodler.
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:34:49
Why are you assuming that it WILL definitely go back to ATH and beyond?
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:33:27
Actually, my coffee this morning showed a semi-circular reverse moon pattern. That's very bearish. Still HODL to the moon though, 20k end of next month.
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:44:42
Just wait, mass adoption is right around the corner brah! To the moon! New paradigm!
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:08:43
Still waiting for any evidence at all to support what you stated, man.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:54:02
Thought it would be obvious.
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:15:38
Oh, really? 
Price, Google searches, Reddit activity and overall sentiment are all down A LOT. 
You're deluding yourself. You only "proof" of the contrary is hope.
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:06:55


How do you manage to delude yourself this way? It's amazing.
@_date: 2018-05-16 09:00:14
I did sell, luckily before the crash.
Apple etc are actual companies that generate value ans revenue, can't really compare Bitcoin with that. There's not even a patent here.
Almost nobody buys Bitcoin "for the tech". It's 99% people who want to sell it to someone else for a higher price later, to make more *money*.
"Adoption" only matters to people in this space in the context of it being something that drives the price up, so they can make *money*.
I've been in the space, I've studied this thing for months, I've been on the forums for countless hours. 
This is the harsh truth: Bitcoin (and the crypto space in general) is nothing more than a "get rich quick" scheme at the moment. Pure speculation.
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:22:06
Get out of here with your rationality, man. You're in the wrong neighborhood.
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:00:32
What happened to you is terrible. Terrible.
Similar thing happened to my buddy Pauly a few years ago. Good, honest guy running an honest business. 
After a year or so of working his ass off 15 hours a day, a few guys came knocking on his door claiming that kidnapping people and selling their organs was """illegal""". What the hell? 
He's *in jail* now! Can you believe these people?
Read this with a Joe Pesci voice, by the way.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:33:45
Never claimed to be an expert. Just to explain that I've been in the space and am not talking out of my ass.

@_date: 2018-05-15 19:20:37
Nah bro, totally organic growth driven by adoption. Buy more, DCA, HODL!

BTC (cryptos in general) would absolutely skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:33:08

Ok, good luck with that.

True. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 00:54:58
So many words wasted, only to say "I have no real evidence, I just really hope it is as I say". Wishful thinking.
What you don't realize is that these "basic perceptive abilities" you speak of are completely subjective and influenced by your own hopes and dreams.
Good luck man.

That is actually one of the foundations of capitalism. Not a socialist at all.
Edit: and, by the way, that's also one of the best aspects of a capitalist economy: free enterprise and people being able to scale their ideas using other people's money, because money actually moves around (there's an incentive to move it).
This does not happen in a socialist country, at all.

OP, you're delusional.
@_date: 2018-06-01 15:38:13

@_date: 2018-06-14 13:57:46
That's why societies need some (controlled) inflation. 
No inflation means there can be no social mobility, meaning that, after a group of people have established economic dominance, everyone else is stuck being poor forever.
This happens because without inflation, the fat cats have no real incentive to invest in smaller entrepreneurs. Rather, they sit on their non-inflationary wealth and just trade it with each other if need be.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:50:10
That sounds like a horrific nightmare.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:34:34

Aw, ok. Well, you can try Coinmama if you can stand higher fees.
Edit: holy shit, don't. it's WAY overpriced now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:21:54
Ben fatto!
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:35:53
They said they put 11 million in it when it was in the single digits.
That means they bought at least one million Bitcoin, so $7,000,000,000 (seven billion) at least, depending which "single digit" the price was at when they bought.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:12:35
I think any exchange that lets you buy with credit/debit card should work with a prepaid as well?
I did it on Coinmama. Crazy fees though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:09:31
There you go.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:45:01
Why exactly sub 2k? Especially considering the fact that it may never happen ever again. Just gonna sit on the sidelines forever?
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:40:33
Aren't the fees on Coinbase calculated by percentage?
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:08:04
I'd love to. Unfortunately, my only real option for BTC purchases using EUR is Coinmama at the moment as I'm living in Thailand.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:57:10
Dude, what country...you're not even bothering to give us any info or do a couple google searches on your own.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:29:28
I don't "wish" Bitcoin to fail. I just don't think it's that good anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-04 04:16:36
Nice, it's actually *the* most useless and pretentious thing I've ever seen!
@_date: 2018-11-04 04:19:43


I think you mean "*if*".


You seem really sure, lol.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:40:32
Well, nothing's really that effective...sorry about calling you an idiot by the way. Rough day.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:16:59


I would define this "biased and optimistic" rather than "realistic".


I disagree. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:26:23
You're mistaken.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:49:38
Sure, that's until you need to be a "licensed channel" in order to operate legally.
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:50:02
Whatever makes you sleep at night.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:00:19
Nah, you're definitely going to the moon bro. $50k by next week guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-11-04 04:10:33


lol, you still believe in partnerships?
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:07:22
This idiot was asking for a way to know with certainty when the price hits bottom and is about to go up. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:06:13
Too slow. Moon NOW. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:47:46


Hey, you involuntarily hit the nail right on the head. That is all there is to crypto. Speculation.
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:06:11
Shhh, they only read headlines here.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:23:34


It might*
It also might not.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:56:46
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:59:16
I do. 
1. Crypto is a whole different story because of how extremely volatile it is, and how illiquid these markets are
2. $100 is huge in "Professional trading" doesn't mean anything, it depends what you're trading
Stop pretending to be a "professional". I see right through your bullshit. You've probably read a few pages from some "trading book" and now you act like a pro. LOL
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:51:25
Yeah, got it: you're assuming that adoption is going to increase exponentially because you really hope that it will, so you can get rich. 
You're basing your assumption on greed.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:29:41
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:09:33
Not really. Sold all of my Bitcoin in December (~17k) when I realized all it had going for it was hype and speculation. I don't have any skin in the game.
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:22:53
Oh, you trade small moves with leverage. And you *accurately* know when these moves occur. You must be a multi-millionaire; you basically print money.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:00:46
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:19:23




@_date: 2018-11-19 18:57:36
I got you, bro. Quick overview:
The bubble popped back in December last year.
Overview over.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:50:33
No. It's just not that good.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:45:22
You're asking for a service that lets you see into the future. Really?
@_date: 2018-11-04 19:48:45
Yeah, it's going to keep going up indefinitely, regardless of interest.
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:55:34


Hope, faith and firm belief that his bags are eventually going to get lighter.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:02:10
lol, I sold in December, get on my level...
errr...I mean, HODL! Moon is just around the corner! Lightning! Bakkt! Moon!
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:39:10
It's volatile because its market is very illiquid. 
To make it more liquid, it would need more and more people trading/using/adopting it (in a balanced way).
So you're assuming that adoption is going to increase in the future, making it more stable. That's a baseless assumption.
Also you contraddict yourself in asserting that on one hand, Bitcoin will be more stable in the future and, on the other hand, it'll be worth a million dollars (this would require EXTREME volatility).
Basically, your argument is flawed in many ways and solely based on your greed and hope in getting rich.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:25:36
Well, that's your opinion.
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:07:07
What he's saying is more along the lines of "I wouldn't touch that steaming pile of shit with a ten foot pole" rather than "I'm afraid to bet against it".
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:13:40


No, it can't.
Did you just compare Bitcoin to the fucking computer and telephone? Jesus Christ please be joking.
@_date: 2018-11-07 09:35:02
What about the chart? Bitcoin is up 1% and you think this makes you right about "the bullrun"? LOL
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:12:38
Do you not realize that every currency ever works like that? Why do you think for example one dollar is worth one loaf of bread? Magic fairy dust?
Every currency's value goes up and down, just not as much as Bitcoin because the latter isn't *really* a currency. It's a speculative asset.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:12:18


That's only if you blindly "HODL". Some people actually sell for a profit before shit hits the fan, you know.
@_date: 2018-11-07 09:36:58
I am! Why shouldn't I
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:58:44
No, it's great. HODL!
@_date: 2018-11-04 04:13:34


There you go. Just use normal money.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:05:05
Bought the top of the bubble and now falling for the "HODL" meme, desperately reading highly biased material in order to justify your losses. Sorry man.
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:33:37




Most sound money &amp; being wildly volatile don't really go that well together.
Also lol @ 1 million.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:04:23
Build a time machine or buy a crystal ball to see the future. Easy.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:30:02
Yeah man, the price will go up indefinitely. Jist HODL, sit tight, and your 0.1 BTC is going to buy you a mansion in a few years, awesome!
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:57:48
I realize our current monetary system is partly a fraud, but that's mostly because of who/what controls it, not because of its design itself in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:41:34
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:13:09
Lmao, "asking for a friend g-guys!"
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:24:49
Is this how feminists cope?
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:54:14




@_date: 2018-11-20 22:23:08
I'm sure mr. Rothschild spends all day on Reddit FUDing Bitcoin, brah.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:26:43
Although most people don't like to admit it, the ONLY reason why it's worth that much (and much, much more in their fantasies) is because they think they can sell it to someone else for a much higher price. 
That's mostly all there is to it. I know, truth hurts.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:59:53


You don't. You bought into a deflating bubble, it's out of your control now.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:32:24


Ding ding ding! Which means they can deny you transactions and apply additional fees. Sounds a lot like something we're all familiar with, doesn't it?
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:21:42
Are you Bitcoin?? No, so SHUT UP!!
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:43:52
Made me sad reading this, man. You should ALWAYS go out of your way to listen to opposing opinions. NEVER get trapped in echo-chambers.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:23:07
Not really. Something being deflationary doesn't mean it necessarily will appreciate. If people don't want it, it's going to depreciate. Bitcoin isn't a magic money-growing tree.
In fact, it has been depreciating for the last three months, pretty heavily.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:02:35


I literally just called it that in a comment just a few minutes ago. Are you me?
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:59:10
Exactly. It's basically just horse betting for the most part.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:35:20
It is, holy shit!
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:25:14
"Little drop" lmao
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:40:29
Thanks OP, good to know.
So basically just use common sense and test it with a small amount before sending your whole stack.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:58:21
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:56:50


What possibilities.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:40:51
Well' I don't have access to full order books, but for reference, on Bitfinex right now it takes about 250 BTC sold at market price for the price to fall by 1%. Plenty of whales have tens of thousands of BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:56:51
You're correct. It's completely arbitrary and holds absolutely ZERO predictive value whatsoever.
People who think they can do this stuff and predict these "markets" are deluding themselves.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:09:48
Using a bit of circular logic there. 
You're saying that price will start moving again thereby attracting new investors, but you're forgetting that in order for the price to move, it needs new money coming in in the first place.
Then again, these markets are a complete joke and manipulated to the bone, so nobody knows what will happen.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:54:13
Yup, you're probably right, no speculation here at all! Just good old organic growth brought by tech and adoption!
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:07:15
Welcome! HODL to the moon!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:04:29


Why are you doing this to yourself?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:35:33
This guy is in it for the tech.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:44:04
lol, Satoshi's wallet sends one BTC to any exchange, everyone is going to freak the hell out and that alone would crash the whole market.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:28:10
Bitcoin was SUPPOSED to be anti-systemic, but it's not going to be. If (IF) it actually gains traction in terms of adoption in the future, someone will find a way to be a middleman.
Either that, or governments will eventually become straight up belligerent towards it and anyone who tries to use it will be suppressed.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:35:08
No, you have it backwards: I sold because I realized that all it is is speculation and hype.
Also, selling was the right move since it's down what, 75% from that moment? You keep HODLing and patting yourself on the back, bro.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:57:44


Natural rising status? Nothing "naturally" rises. Things need reasons to do so.
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:03:46
What does that have to do with Bitcoin not actually being a currency?
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:12:38
It could be interesting for you to see Google search trends for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:33:10

About three fiddy
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:28:53
I bought twice from Coinmama, from Thailand, all went well both times.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:41:37
As an individual, it's great. Not so much for other entities.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:30:08
Oh boy.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:57:55
By "basic math" he means "I really hope it's the truth so I'm going to delude myself"
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:59:07
Yes, it must be something else. It can't be that people no longer have faith in Bitcoin. Impossible.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:22:00
Angry deluded noob maximalist, lol.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:33:45


It's not. You'd be surprised to see how easy it would be, in theory, to flash crash this thing to $1000. Any big player could easily do it right now.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:49:56
Look at tx volume. It's low.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:26:41
Out of sight, out of mind, huh?
@_date: 2018-07-21 00:50:01
Ah there you go! Love at first bite sounds good!
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:29:15
You forgot its value swings by 20% daily, constantly. Not ideal for a currency. It's actually more of a sepculative asset.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:07:31
Does it say "love at first site" on the slim side? I think it's supposed to be "love at first sight".
@_date: 2018-07-12 11:31:21
Waiting for the next Bart, you guys are going to say "bull run! Yeah!" and then it's gonna drop again.
This is so amusing.
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:49:56
BULLISH. TO THE MOON. 100K BY MAY.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:35:42
They're completely right though. It fucks you up like nothing else. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:40:29
It's used quite a bit as a speculative asset. Not that much as a currency, if at all.
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:33:42
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:50:32
To the moooon Bitcoin $1,000,000,000 by June!
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:47:58
*goes up*
*goes down*
EXTRA BULLISH!
*goes sideways*
ABOUT TO BREAK OUT! WEAK HANDS BTFO!
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:33:55
Gonna eat the proverbial shorts for sure.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:39:04
Don't get fooled by order books. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:30:25
No, it's totallly organic growth THIS TIME! To the moooooon
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:03:26
Happens all the time, it's the most basic market manipulation technique. Order books are NOT to be trusted, ever.
