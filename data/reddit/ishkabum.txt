Yea exactly, also why one should hold some of those other majors LTC and DOGE which exchanges have pairs for that transfer faster and have lower fees. They are much easier for traders to use. It really sucks when you miss a buying opportunity because you can't get Bitcoin transferred in time.

I'd recommend getting an account on an exchange because coin base does take pretty high fees. I used gdax but I haven't used since 2017 so I'm not sure if anything's changed with it. You just transfer,wait a few days and then you can buy without the high fees. Also even if you are super bullish, no one knows where this is going so really don't spend too much. Diversify other savings. You can also have a cash account with Marcus and earn 2.2% interest, for example.

Looks amazing. I'd suggest making the FUD icon a different color, less similar to the B icons so it's very clear it hurts you.

How is it not though? It's not like everyone will stop selling. There will still constantly be transactions.

If you had sold and put everything into the S&amp;P ... You would be ...... A POSER. And you wouldn't want that would you.

I feel like right now it's more of an asset because you don't have many applications of it as a currency. It's kind of like a massive presale event that's going on right now, we're all stocking up before we can even really use them for much. But it needs to level out to be a currency is the thing. Doesn't make sense for somebody to spend it if it gained 20% value in a month or something.

Yeah I just bought for the first time as it looks like a temporary dip. Hello rollercoaster. I bought first at 2527... then again at 2492 ... then again at 2480 ... lol. This is the same thing I do in my paper trading account. When I'm going long and I keep misjudging the dip, I'll just keep doubling down more and more as it dives. I think it'll work out. I'm definitely *late* but I don't think I'm too late. It looks long strong to me.

Get an account with Gemini. Good interface, not too expensive, doesn't have the same volatility that Coinbase does right now.

There were two separate questions. Yes you need credentials, or yes you do not and can create a wallet there?
