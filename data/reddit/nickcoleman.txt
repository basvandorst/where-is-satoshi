Recommended sites to do so? I know "Google it yourself" but I rather here shit from people more in the game than I am.

Still new to the whole game. What exchange you use?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:28:12
Don't know, but it seems like an extra step for free exchange (Which not complaining). Still, feels like the iPhone 7 widget just to listen to music because Apple forgot to install a headphone port.

Bread allows you to buy bit from the wallet. I was sketched about that.

Yeah I have breadwallet, but not too sure on using it to buy bitcoin on.

I have the wallet but want to start buying Bitcoins on it. I guess that's truly where my question lies. If 2014 and still good. I'll take that into account.

Sorry I'm still new to all this. Seed? Laugh all you want, just don't wanna jump head first and get fucked.

It's cool. I'm going to use Coinbase. Seems legit so far. Also is it bad to have multiple wallets? Want to buy not only Bit but other coins as well.
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:27:38
Yeah I have it, but reviews on it are in the terrible range plus the 3rd party for buying Bitcoins on the app.
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:03:41
That's what I'm planning on doing. Just needed good info like this. Thanks for helping.
