* "What do you want us to do? Just go pour bitcoins and page views over you just because you advertised here once?"
Yes, that's exactly what we want you to do; but only if what we've built is something useful. If it isn't, the point of posting here is to make it BETTER. By making our site better, and giving you a place to spend Bitcoins, it increases liquidity into the marketplace; that liquidity, in turn, will continue to increase the adoption of Bitcoin as a currency. It's been said above, but I'll say this: if people hoard Bitcoins as a commodity, it would suck for everyone in the space.
Our intent of posting here is hardly as sinister as you're making it seem. We adopted bitcoin because we believe in it as a currency, and as a simple way for people worldwide to work and get paid. Since we're a merit-priced market, our platform is *built* on equality - whether you're in South America or New York, we believe you should be judged on the quality of work you deliver. Adopting Bitcoin was therefore a no-brainer. It's a global currency that everyone can work for (regardless of origin) and it made sense to our business.
* "Maybe it's just a sign that bitcoin adoption isn't anywhere near the levels we thought"
Is Bitcoin adoption booming? Not yet; in fact, we got a ton of traffic today from Reddit alone but not a single conversion. So no, I'm not sipping mojitos on a beach, instead, I'm working my butt off to try to make something awesome, and hopefully, to help the community as a whole. Instead of jumping over the businesses that are trying to earn your business, why not work with them so your bitcoins will actually continue to appreciate in value?

Strange, I can't reproduce the bug. Can you please pm me a screen shot or tell me the error you're getting? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:53:09
Done! (and thanks!!)
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:35:50
Sure, I buy that. It definitely is an issue for us; but we already have a few services offered by sellers that accept Bitcoin. Even if Fiverr (and others) exist, none accept Bitcoin yet...
Hopefully we can continue to grow and get the necessary chickens (and eggs) on the site :-)

There's no way to LOSE in this. I've sipped the kool aid, and my cofounder and I both believe very strongly in what bitcoin offers. It's frictionless, has very low transaction costs, it was actually quite easy to integrate thus far.
How do we make it better though? Should we show the QR codes on the gig "tiles"? Is that something desirable? How can we make things *better*? What I'm saying is, if this is something the community wants/needs, we're happy to make it happen.

We only launched a few months ago; we're a marketplace where people can offer small services (think: microlancer.com or fiverr.com) such as graphic design, voiceovers, programming, basic web help, etc. The difference is that we're using an improved review system that adjusts price based on past buyer feedback.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:19:13
Thanks so much - I'll try to get that fixed right away!
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:49:58
Curious - I know about job4bitcoins (but there's no escrow there), and no 'review' system there at all. What are other sites where you can freelance for bitcoins? I've been reaching out to sellers manually to gain traction, but if you have any suggestions for prominent sellers that you know of, please let me know! I think we do offer a vastly improved marketplace over a lot of the competition, so hopefully it will catch on!

Thanks! PS: I love your username...
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:15:52
Hadn't seen those yet. As I said, we adopted bitcoin because it made sense to our business, so we really haven't looked at a ton of the competition in the space. I wonder how those sites are getting traction...I just hope that businesses continue to support what bitcoin is doing; ultimately, we need to stop comparing it to fiat currency and instead, focus on bitcoin itself...
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:15:52
To game it, you'd have to buy the service to "buck it up". The amount of price increase would be less than the commission you'd pay to the site, so it's not worth it. 
PS: really sorry to hear about the hospital situation. I sincerely hope you feel better soon!!

So why are you still holding them? If that's your true opinion, why not just sell them?
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:22:58
Yikes. You've hit a bug and we'll get right on that! We just pushed a bunch of new changes to support Bitcoin so I'm guessing something broke in the process.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:22:22
That's actually my biggest 'concern' around bitcoin (and again, I'm still quite new to it), is that people hold bitcoins like a commodity that appreciates in value and therefore are reluctant to spend them. People need to spend them to make it a viable currency.
I think that if enough places start developing around BTC, it'll give people enough of a reason to do so. I figure that if we do our part, and create a place for people to earn (and spend) Bitcoins, it'll help move things along :)
I hope it's just an anomaly, and just a 'slow start', and is not a result of our execution of adding Bitcoin to our site. To our knowledge, aside from we didn't see a lot of places to actually do work for bitcoins right now.
Is it obvious enough on the page?
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:04:38
Wow. Anyone who slanders a community of people willing to help out is just silly. 
I can say this though -- getting people to actually spend BTC is MUCH harder than I thought it'd be.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:46:35
I'm not sure really what to say other than to repeat what I've said earlier; when we *first* launched the page, we had a starting price of $5; this has long been removed and we encourage users to post services starting at higher prices.
Edit: You'll notice that we don't have a lot of sellers yet accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment (we just added this functionality today). Any idea where we could get some freelancers to start selling in bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:29:34
I agree! 
When we first launched, we foolishly thought it would be good to have all services start at five bucks. We've just relaunched, removing the restriction. 
People can list at any price...the older gigs just happen to still be at the old starting price. 
Hope this clarifies things.
