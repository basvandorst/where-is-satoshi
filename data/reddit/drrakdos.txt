The "a guy walks into a bar" joke isn't illogical. That joke actually makes logical sense.
The point is, it isn't funny. Not even close. It undermines the problem of super expensive college and tries to shift the blame away from those who are making college expensive and trying to pin it on those trying to make it better.

That is one of the most idiotic things I've heard.
You do realize the vast majority of college professors support at the very least lowering the cost of tuition right?
Strawman argument

I've always hated you.
This "meme" is a strawman, and contains exactly the kind of arguments I'd expect from people who worship made up money

So uh, why'd you buy bitcoin buddy
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:12:46
Ah, it's a joke, suddenly the strawman goes away and it is in no way illogical.
Thank you for your superior reasoning. Because as we all know, a joke suddenly washes away all problems with the premises it is founded on.

No, that comment points out the utter hypocrisy in the statement. In *what fucking universe* does a response to "this is why we must have limited supply" with "you believe in a currency based on nothing" in any way, shape, or form *must mean* that I'm jealous? *what the fuck do i have to be jealous of*
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:17:18
That's your reply? It's a strange how people even *think* to say such dribble, let alone think that it surmounts to anything. Hearing critique of something or pointing out flaws in something and then replying to that with "you mad" or "salty" is akin to saying "nuh uh!"
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:41:04
Much easier than defending yourself with logic, eh?

That question is based on the assumption I agree that gold should have been a currency or that it should be based on anything.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:07:40
That is precisely the problem. He is mocking the federal reserve (the US dollar) for not being limited. Why isn't it limited? Because it is only based on what the reserve values it as, and they'll also argue the value that people put onto it. What does that mean? It isn't based on anything. Just like bitcoin. See the hypocrisy? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:35:31
You people believe in a currency based on nothing 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:42:23
How does that in any way imply I'm fourteen? Please, do explain.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:57:31
You're dodging again. I'm making no claim of what it *should be* but only of what it *is*. And bitcoin is based on nothing tangible, therefore op is a hypocrite and you're defending him with strawmen, imbecile
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:29:46
You keep asserting my age but you haven't provided any proof or even explained why it's relevant, not only that but I actually admit my age in some of posts. You're just a typical reactionary with your thumb up your asshole. Then we have the typical "this is the internet, therefore anything I say goes- even if I contradict myself and admit I'm wrong. Fuck values and logic"
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:57:31
That's like if you use the n word and i point out it's racist that therefore implies I'm black, or if you call someone a f*g that therefore means I'm gay. It sounds more like you're the young one here , because your critical thinking skills aren't very well developed.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:30:22
Lol. That's the joke. You people don't understand Marxism so we mock you people by mispelling marx, implying you people do it or wouldn't know the difference. And you got pretty upset about it. And also allow me to say, when you say "what's it like being 14" that implies you've never been fourteen, therefore meaning you are younger than 14. Kind of puts a damper on the whole ageism thing, dunnit?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:50:00
Just like the federal reserve, supply is only limited to a degree, and it can be changed at any time. The federal reserves entire job is to choose at what point should the currency be limited and how much should go into circulation, or, in rare circumstances, taken away. Bitcoin is no exception to this.
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:07:31
You're proud to act like a dumbass. Also, I'm still waiting for your argument and proof. You just asserted something and left it at that without explanation. Typical reactionary.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:21:50
That is a dodge. We are not talking about other currencies. OP said that "this is why we need limited supply". But Bitcoin gets its representative value from... no where. The people buying it give it value (kinda like the federal reserve) but it isn't based on any tangible object. If bitcoin doesn't get its value from something tangible (in fact it gets its value because people are buying it with other currencies, hmm) then what does that say about its supply? Ah. That while logic thing makes this post pretty goddamn hypocritical.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:40:00
It gets its value from the buyers. You even admitted that yourself up until this point. Are you, too, becoming a hypocrite in order to defend bitcoin to the bitter end? This isn't even an argument against bitcoin (although I will admit I am against bitcoin) this is an argument saying that the notion that the reserve is bad because it does not limit supply until it so chooses and that bitcoin is good (taking into account that it does, in fact, is not necessarily limited, just like the federal reserve) is wrong. What is so hard for you to get here? And why have you argued, point after point, strawmen that are completely and utterly irrelevant to the conversation and then pull a whole 360?
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:18:07
Imagine thinking this way and being haughty about it.

I'm a communist. There should be no currency, and trade is to be abolished. To each according to his need, from each according to his ability. Our idealized society is one in which of someone needs a commodity or a necessity they may simply go out to a distribution center of some kind and get the object that is in need. Currency keeps people from getting the products they need and exploiting their labor.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:25:17
That's fine and dandy. But that doesn't make his critique of "this is why supply should be limited" any less hypocritical. Man, you have trouble not arguing strawmen, don't you? You *cannot* say that currency should be limited *and be in favor of bitcoin*. You can have critique over centralization, you can have critique over whether it's free market or not, that's so fair, but you're an idiot if you think it's relevant to this conversation (and it isnt). That is a *separate conversation*, a separate set of claims. He said W. X is true of Bitcoin, Y is true of The Feds. His conclusion, Z, is *invalid* because X and Y are the same thing (the fact that both currencies are. Not. Limited.) Therefore, OP is a hypocrite and you have done nothing but argue points that are completely irrelevant to that fact in order to defend bitcoin, further making the lot of you look just as ignorant as we think you are.
