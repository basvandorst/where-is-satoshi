Although it's wrong to say the price "must go up due to the cost of mining", I think there is at least a weak causal link relationship between mining difficulty and BTC price.
If one has to work 100x harder than last year to mine the same amount of BTC, this certainly has an effect on its perceived value.

Umm no. You are misrepresenting my position. Since I don't want to misrepresent your position, I won't say that it seems you believe that the purpose of public relations is to deceive the public. The purpose of PR is to raise awareness among the public, even through good news and truth. As an example of how this can be done, my fiance works in PR/marketing for a non-profit and thus she aims to build awareness of their cause (Fair Trade to help farmers in 3rd world countries) through social media, press releases, stories in magazines, interviews, promotions, etc. You seem to believe that spreading awareness about Bitcoin would be detrimental. On that point, we fundamentally disagree.
If Coinbase implements a new feature, do you not believe that the public should be made to know about it? You are conflating two arguments here. No one is claiming that PR is the implementing of needed features, nor am I saying that engineering is not needed or that it is bad. Implementing useful services using the protocol is what engineering is for. I am an engineer. PR is a catalyst for growth and is *also* useful. 
We need billboards and stuff. PR is good. Stop hating.

This is the best news I've heard all week. I'm glad they're implementing changes. It's about time.
They've done a terrible job throughout this whole fiasco at communicating their progress. The result has been a $2 billion loss of market cap or more as well as emotional distress of countless customers. Not once did they demonstrate that they were BTC solvent (which led to rampant speculation), give/keep a timeline for fixing their problems, genuinely admit they made mistakes whereas instead they passed the buck, admit the amount of any thefts that occurred, state that the market for trading GoxCoins for Bitcoins was unnecessary, ask for forgiveness, or temporarily offer fee free trading. They are offering no incentives to their customers to ever use their "service" again. They have shaken and continue to erode the confidence of current and potential Bitcoin users.
It shouldn't have to be this way.

The BTC supply is increasing at a known rate, as you know. We are discussing mining difficulty, which does have an effect on perceived value and thus demand. An increase in demand causes an increase in price, just as an increase in supply causes a decrease in price, as you say. As competition for new bitcoins has gotten so steep that a miner has to now spend $10k on hardware in early 2014, instead of $100 as in 2013, to mine 0.01 BTC in a month, the marginal cost for an individual to make a new Bitcoin has gone up. Now, short term price increases, that can happen due to many factors, such as Chinese demand, have made bitcoins very valuable to mine lately, thus further incentivizing new miners. Ever increasing hashing power in pursuit of new profits is perpetually raising the marginal cost to make a Bitcoin. There is definitely a link between marginal cost and what people perceive a reasonable market price to be. Thus increasing mining difficulty imparts momentum to the price. There is positive feedback at work here. The Bitcoin market has been accepting for four years that an ever increasing market price is justified, though of course price changes are driven by other factors too. Demand continues to increase. When the rate of demand increasing exceeds the tiny rate of supply decreasing, one expects the price to rise. The mining difficulty increases alone have a positive effect on price.
TL;DR demand goes up too, more than supply, because of perceptions related to increasing marginal cost.

You should understand that mining and selling are not the same thing. For example, I sold some bitcoins at an exchange yesterday that were mined in the past by someone else. My doing this does not depend on whether new bitcoins are being mined right now or not.
The price of a bitcoin is set by supply and demand. Supply not changing over time (i.e., mining stops) doesn't change this.

Someone owning thousands of bitcoins would be foolish to try to sell them in one order on an exchange in which case they wouldn't receive the market price for most of the coins. A rational whale seller would space the orders out over time. You should be equally scared of a whale causing a buy order which would cause a massive upward crash.

You've explained well how proof of ownership and tracking of property is a lot more complicated with Bitcoin. Absolutely.
You raise the point that perhaps this isn't theft since the bitcoins were transferred to the exchange, (no one would dispute that they sent them to the exchange), and although they won't give the bitcoins back, they claim they are "lost". I would claim such a situation is theft if and only if they did not return the property when requested AND if *they* were the ones responsible for the loss. If they were really exploited through a vulnerability or robbed, that reduces their liability, and I sympathize. Mark claiming that you sent him the bitcoins does not make them his, however. I think the situation is analogous to a valet company parking cars-- you give someone the keys to the car under the assumption that they will park your car and return it for a fee. Gox is now claiming that their entire parking lot of cars was stolen. Are they liable? Unless they claim that like Godzilla came in and smashed up the parking lot, they are.
So although it can be much more complicated to track bitcoins rather than a truck of watermelons, I think that basic property ownership rights still apply.
The TOS makes it a bit tricky. I was a Gox customer and actually did not read through all the TOS. I believe that if the TOS blatantly violates the law as would be the case of saying something like "we are not responsible for liabilities", I don't think it would be enforceable. 
I would be fine losing my coin and seeing Mark in federal PMITA prison if guilty, because I feel that justice would be served and it would set an example that this behavior will not be tolerated by Bitcoin businesses. Trust is essential. Basic property law and contract enforcement are necessary for the proper functioning of society.
Thanks for the healthy discussion. I should get back to work. :-)

Currently, each block that is mined (every ten minutes) gives a standard reward of 25 BTC, though this reward halves every four years. Transaction fees are also added this standard block reward to be distributed to the miners. This amount might be about 0.1 BTC, for a total of 25.1 BTC. Over time, the fraction of total block rewards represented by the transaction fees will increase. There will always be an incentive to mine, ensuring the health of the network for many years to come.

$100,000/BTC*12,200,000BTC= $1,220,000,000,000 ($1.22 trillion). If there are 7 billion people on earth, that would imply that each person on earth owns an average of $170 worth of BTC. As a comparative example, estimating the value of all gold on the earth, we have ~170k tons which equals ~5.5 billion ounces. At ~$1250 an ounce I estimate the value of all gold in the world at ~$7 trillion. Although bitcoin coming close to gold as a store of value is a moonshot, it is within the realm of possibility. Reaching $100,000 per BTC would represent BTC being roughly 1/6 as valuable as gold.

Bitcoin transaction processing is not slow. Transactions are broadcast to the network within seconds and waiting for confirmations is not necessary when the proper miner fee is paid.
Other cryptocurrencies are faster but trade security for speed, so would thus perhaps be more suitable than Bitcoin for smaller transactions as the network scales. Off-blockchain transactions are also a solution, such as through Coinbase.

Yeah. Those well versed in the technical merits of Bitcoin are definitely the only ones fit to issue Bitcoin PR statements right now. The CEO's of Bitcoin companies should have a big hand in issuing PR statements on really complex matters. This is not always the case however, look at Mt. Gox for example. They are in the midst of a PR disaster, and could have used an extra set of eyes from a PR professional, though communications seem to be now improving.
Regarding trust, I think trust is important. Bitcoin the protocol allows for trustless transactions, which really means that you can trust the protocol without trusting other parties, and which is why Bitcoin is awesome. On the other hand, I trusted Mt. Gox with my bitcoins to not halt withdrawals indefinitely, which in retrospect was a mistake. I wish I had your lack of trust in this situation. But we without a doubt need must be able to trust Bitcoin based services for Bitcoin to truly succeed (i.e., they must be honest). With the recent events on Mt. Gox and Silk Road 2.0, we are seeing that we cannot trust right now many of the operators of these organizations with our Bitcoins, and the price is seriously hurting as a result, because this is limiting applications and security. Though I dislike banks, I trust that my money is safe in a bank. But a bank is not the future of money in my opinion. Go Bitcoin.
Be wary of who you trust. But if people can trust Bitcoin services, we will be so much more powerful. In that regard, the whole bitcoin ecosystem needs to change, and ditch shady companies for trusted ones.

Good point. It seems unfathomable that they would have insolvency problems given their enormous net income and the fact that they operate with a zero reserve. 
This fiasco is probably due to either a technical problem as Mt Gox is claiming, a huge theft they are not admitting to, or a government investigation related to anti money laundering compliance.

The same could be said about any two currencies-- this is not unique to dogecoin and bitcoin. Of course one should want to hold a currency that increases in value the most. Perhaps that dogecoin loses value over time is one reason why people tip with it more. I have 20,000 DOGE and I don't care what the exchange rate is. 


To a layperson bitcoin and dogecoin are different even though you and I know the underlying technologies for the two are really similar. You're forgetting that dogecoin is cuter than bitcoin. That is worth something.

I think they should crash and die. But they should at least give their customers their money back. Moving money out of an exchange actually shouldn't have an effect on price.

Bitcoins are property. There is no law explicitly stating that Bitcoins (or watermelons, for example) are property, yet if $400 million worth of watermelons were stolen, it would still be theft. Theft is theft. New laws are not necessary to outlaw theft of new inventions.
I meant that prosecution of theft and needing new laws/regulations/bureaucracy that would suppress the Bitcoin economy  are two different things. One does not require the other. Hope that helps.


True. I am hopeful that definitive evidence obtained through other means exposes what really happened. That Mark will not explain what happened raises eyebrows and in itself warrants further investigation. Perhaps Mark is not guilty of any wrongdoing, in which case he should remain free. This seems unlikely.
@_date: 2014-08-15 02:45:54
I feel like the addresses where the "stolen" coins went would have been shared if they were really stolen by hackers.
No one has denied that it is a gov't gag order and Mark hinted about a gag order by the US gov't in one of his online chats when Mt. Gox was crashing. 
I feel that the U.S. gov't has a strong incentive to have a large cache of coins to sell or hold in case bitcoin becomes very powerful.
The FBI took the silk road coins, but this could have been another organization.

As a customer, you should choose who you do business with based at least partly on encouraging better business practices. I suggest supporting another exchange that is transparent, fixes problems promptly (or doesn't have problems in the first place), apologizes when it makes mistakes, and cares about customer satisfaction.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:10:15
Any self respecting court could be convinced of the integrity of the blockchain, and I fault you for not recognizing it. The blockchain cannot be forged-- it represents a consensus of all nodes in the network. The addresses belonging to Gox can be proven as such, and from there it is possible to track transactions down the blockchain. 
While not an established technology, the Bitcoin Blockchain IS evidence. I'm sorry you are unable to grasp its utility. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 03:32:20
drunk guy chiming in here.
What if block rewards were modified so that large pools/miners received less than small pools as a negative feedback mechanism towards decentralization. Is this possible? Any possible downside?
e.g. 
control &lt;30% of hash power, receive 100% block reward
control 30% of hash power, receive 99% block reward
control 35% of hash power, receive 90% block reward
control 40% of hash power, receive 70% block reward
control 45% of hash power, receive 30% block reward
control &gt;50% of hash power, receive 1% block reward

Yeah-- we are on the same team. You've provided a good example of how PR can act in the best interests of an organization while misleading the public through manipulation. Fair enough. I'm claiming that if an entity/organization is acting in good faith and has nothing to hide, PR, even when manipulative, is useful for putting the organization's best merits in the spotlight while addressing any concerns or misconceptions honestly. Thus, the organization and the public benefits from such communications. In your case, if Bitcoin as a whole is your company, you wouldn't want a dumb intern telling a reporter "I just use Bitcoin to buy drugs". You could instead defer to arguments made by Andreas, who is doing great PR for Bitcoin almost single handedly, or you might say something like "Fiat currency is still mostly used in purchasing illicit drugs, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is superior to fiat currency for X,Y,Z reasons, so it's important not to stifle its growth. We have only scratched the surface of its limitless potential".

@_date: 2014-02-04 14:56:05
I think that their claim that the problem is related to transaction size may be legitimate, though I am skeptical. For example, I have been waiting on a 29 BTC withdrawal for three days-- according to 
the transaction size is over 1661, which may be a reason for its failure. 
"LT = Large Transaction Size - The number of transactions on the input/outputs over 1662 may be far too many for the applied fee meaning they will never be processed. MtGox will double spend this transaction and re-issue."
It may really be a computer system issue. It's too early to be sure either way.

The U.S. gov't was never reported to have seized BTC from Gox though, right? A situation paralleling the Silk Road seizure seems plausible. All this started to go down around when Charlie Schrem was arrested for money laundering.
I'm guessing. Karpeles withholding so much information just makes it seem like he is not allowed to divulge information because of an investigation.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:13:35
Among Bitcoin transactions, the sender and recipient are often the same person. It's sort of like writing a check to one's self-- should that really count as a transaction? One can argue that self-transactions are not really meaningful for the sake of comparison with a company handling actual remittances between different parties, though the general inability to distinguish a self-transaction from a two-party transaction in the blockchain makes this somewhat dubious transaction volume number the best estimate of BTC economic activity that we've got.

The reason is simple: contrarian investing. 
Bitcoin the technology is robust as hell. The current market cap of $3 billion seems low for a revolutionary technology that isn't about to go away.
The recent downtrend was very sharp. It's unknown whether prices like this will exist again--the market seems oversold at the moment. If the price were to silently creep back up to $400, which wouldn't be particularly newsworthy at this point, one could double their money.

@_date: 2015-01-20 20:02:11
It doesn't seem to be a limit. 20MB is just a block size that is significantly larger than 1MB. At some block size it won't be feasible for the hardware in the network to handle, but we're not there yet, even with 20MB. This block size can scale further in the future as hardware and networking speeds further improve. The block size limit is hardcoded into the bitcoin protocol--thus the limit should be changed if the community wants to address scalability.

Not sure why you're getting downvoted-- you're technically correct. Moore's Law says that transistors will keep getting smaller year after year-- this is not very applicable to data storage since high capacity HDD's don't use transistors to store bits, although SSD's do. So maybe. 
Networking capability mostly depends on companies like Comcast releasing vice grips from our balls. I'm only half joking-- we have the technology for much faster networking speeds already, it's a matter of deployment. Fiber optic lines to the home would give us 1Gbit/s or more.
Also, Moore's Law is going to end a lot sooner than 2035. It's already slowing down. A more realistic estimate is around 2020. Making 10nm transistors is hard.

@_date: 2015-01-21 13:39:52
No, simply stating that the pace of scaling is slowing down. As soon as we can't scale down 2x every 18 months, Moore's Law is technically no longer valid.
Its predictive power is already starting to fade. Thus one could argue that Moore's law has ended already. I've heard reports that new technology nodes no longer refer to actual gate sizes, (e.g. 14 nm) but to one or more new metrics such as "they're the same size as before, but we've made them a little bit closer together than they used to be, so we'll say they're smaller to stay on the roadmap."

This a million times. The market price of a stock is constantly affected by feedback from the intrinsic value of the underlying business. If the stock price exceeds the value of the business, a downward correction in market price will occur at some point. Bitcoin is a different type of money. It’s intrinsic value is derived from its relative utility compared to other currencies. It can benefit from positive feedback. Positive price movement leads to further positive price movement.

@_date: 2015-03-26 02:16:37
Thanks very much for inquiring for feedback and for your commitment to improving your product. There were several confusing things about the process that could be streamlined to make it easier for the user.
Perhaps it would be best to have a pop up screen ask the user if they have a password after one puts in the seed. That would prevent someone from putting their seed in (having not checked the box) and then arriving at the outcome that I did. Better still, have the password screen pop up no matter what and write leave blank if there is no password. That is what Electrum did. Also, definitely give an instruction to distinguish between PIN and password. That is not 100% clear.
As I already had an HD account on Mycelium but with a zero balance, it seemed that I was unable to create a second HD account to import the seed, which was a bit frustrating. The software said "you can only have one unused HD account" or something similar. When I tried to delete an account it had a problem too. I think I received something like "You must have at least one account." at least once, but I do remember being able to delete once too. I couldn't find a way to import a new HD account from the user interface. There should be a way to do this that does not involve reinstalling the software, or it should be more clear how to do this. Of course, when one first starts Mycelium on a fresh install, it prompts you do import a seed which is what I wanted to do.
If I could have easily restarted the process again, spotting the box to check would have been a bit easier. Having to reinstall was stressful because of the amount of money involved. Not seeing the balance pop up is heart rending, especially when an error screen doesn't come up, as one can imagine. :-)
Trying Electrum failed-- it brought the balance but wouldn't let me spend. As Slush pointed out, they are not yet supportive of Trezor seeds. Ultimately Mycelium worked. 
You guys are awesome. I really appreciate the work you do. I would also happily suggest some improvements to iOS wallet if you are interested-- firstly PIN protection.
Keep up the great work. :-)

It decreases gate count necessary to perform a hash-- this means you would get lower power per hash on a smaller area of silicon. With the extra real estate, you can perform more hashes/second with the same amount of power and area, and/or perform the same amount of hashes with a smaller chip/less power.

I'm intrigued by the potential for small (or large), quick, easy, pseudononymous payments made by many people on a short time scale that otherwise wouldn't be received due to lack of a traditional donation channels existing with any other currency. The major innovations of the Bitcoin protocal include not needing to give out personally identifiable information and the utter lack of institutional 3rd party (and 4th/5th/6th party) barriers to transmitting money instantly to anyone around the world.
People who care more about writing the donation off on their taxes probably aren't going to donate anyway.

"Spending money" bitcoin in a smartphone can be even more secure than cash in a wallet. You can require login credentials to access the coins so that if someone were to steal your phone, though they would have your hardware, they would not be able to get to your coins. For example, using the Coinbase App, I have access to my coins for micropayment purposes on my phone, but am worry free about losing the phone, as I would be able to access and protect the coins through my computer in the event the phone was no longer in my possession.

Let's all settle down here! I don't think there is a lie being taught about in schools. Barely anything is being taught in schools these days.
Economics 101: It is in a company's best interest to monopolize a market in order to maximize its profits, however, this outcome is not usually an efficient allocation of resources for society as a whole as this allows for price gouging (e.g. Comcast). Governments have the power to reign in monopolies (e.g. Microsoft antitrust lawsuits in the 90's). It is a basic principle of economics that free markets are usually the best way to organize economic activity, but sometimes government action is useful for ensuring overall prosperity. Full lassez-faire libertarianism is not healthy but over regulation sucks too. Let's find a reasonable compromise and not treat each other like we're all insane.

I agree with what you're saying that bitcoin must grow in real ways that matter, i.e., number of merchants accepting bitcoins and the strength and security of the network. Nonetheless, I think more exposure is just the catalyst our community needs. Investment drives demand, and believe me, if investors are making a good return, they will not dump more than they pump. A rapidly rising bitcoin price raises eyebrows. This is good.

It seems Marcus truly wants to integrate Bitcoin but that he feels it's not yet ready for prime time.  This is very good news from an investment standpoint and for those eager to have improved access to a more efficient medium of exchange.  The infrastructure, awareness and interest supporting Bitcoin do need to grow further. But it seems to just be a matter of time. In the possible event PayPal does integrate some time in the next several years, Bitcoin will soar like a hawk.

A company with a true monopoly does not lose market share when they screw their customers. That is why they do so. If they lose market share by price gouging, as they ideally should, then they are not a monopoly. I cited Comcast as my best example and I stand by that. Fuck them. Shitty customer service and zero innovation because they don't have to compete. 
Notwithstanding Comcast, companies that achieve an impressive market share (success stories) by being awesome are totally fine by me.

I switched a week ago for this reason but was actually disappointed in Coinbase's android app-- their iOS app worked much better. The pin protection doesn't even work. If someone gains access to your phone, they can take all of your coins. There have also been complaints about buy/sell not working, though I haven't verified this. Mycelium works very well however.
edit: pin protection works for sending out BTC but not for opening the app.

My point is that a monopoly can persist long term without government influence. Standard Oil existed as a monopoly (due to its innovative business practices as you cite) and it was the government that tried to shut it down. Its trivial to say that no business can exist long term when nothing lasts infinitely long, but there are real world monopolies.
Indeed, Standard Oil did a lot of great things and that's why they succeeded.

You present valid motivators for donating through traditional channels, though there is no reason these donor-payee relationships couldn't exist with Bitcoin alone, if desired. Kiva could accept bitcoin and it would still work fine. 
By 3rd party I'm referring to an intermediary payment processor. So if there are three necessary parties: payee, donor, and non-profit org, the 4th and 5th parties would be a credit card company and a bank. I don't think they are needed.
Some people have attention spans that can only be measured in nanoseconds, and ease of use is nothing to scoff at. Which of the following is preferable for making a donation? 
a) Please give me your credit card information.
b) Here is a QR code of my public address.
