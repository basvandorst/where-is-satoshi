$1,000, $2,000, $10,000, $50,000
1 Year: the current bubble will continue but correct just around $1,000
3 Year: growth will be slow but consistent as the underlying infrastructure develops
5 Year: another halving reduces inflation and the long term trend continues
10 Year: Bitcoin faces mass adoption, but the previous global financial elite try to hold onto their power polarizing the population and causing some form of war or conflict

Actually, Bitcoin is currently disinflationary, not deflationary (the supply is still increasing, but at a decreasing rate).

I accidentally bought at $6000 (left a buy order in the books and forgot about it) as it collapsed down to ~$3200. I hodled and am feeling like a badass right now.

I like the article, but the Coinbase link to earn $10 in the disclaimer at the top cheapens the article and certainly the disclaimer itself.

I just hope that people are smart enough to vote with exit. Leave Vietnam for good.
