Their customer service is horrible. I have been corresponding with them for weeks over something and they are 90% unresponsive/100% unhelpful. 
They should really focus less on other currency and more on customer service/services.

Too much money and regulation is being put into Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other crypto currencies for prices to drop to 0. The investors that are building the business and infrastructure are counting on the price being high and so am I. 
In for the win. Spend! HOLD!

Love both currencies.

True. It is in effect now. Shouldn't be an issue if WeMineLTC swaps over. Users should see no issues.

Woot! Litecoin!

Note buying it. Apple is so anti government access they are willing to be fined over it. Sure, some malware could be installed. But from the factory with no malware, not buying it.

Wow, I can't believe all the LTC hate in here. Is LTC stealing any of BTC time in the sun? No. 
In fact LTC supports BTC! Many LTC owners own BTC.

There are 4 times are many LTC than BTC. LTC has lower transaction fees (also a lower price point). LTC has faster conformations than BTC. It is also based on a mining algorithm called Scypt. BTC is based on SHA-256. Scrypt was meant to be ASIC and GPU mining resistant. However, due the money to be made by mining LTC this resistanace has been slightly overcome. It is still ASIC and GPU resistant in comparison to BTC.
My personal opinion is LTC will make a great secondary crypocurrency that one would use for smaller quick transactions. This is due to the lower fee per transaction and the speed. It doesn't replace BTC.
