Any idea why sometimes the transactions don't go through to the next block? I didn't know that. Sounds like a lottery you don't want to be in and makes me uncomfortable for the next time I need to send a larger amount.

Thanks guys. Turns out that waiting was the key here. Just now the transaction went through.

Good....about time he spoke up in detail!

I thought the exact same thing when I heard this story this week. Anyone running any full nodes in a cave or EMP proof bunker? Any plans for launching a full node on a solar storm proof satelite?

I logged in just now, after the site became available again, and:
* My BTC balance is not correct: it is not displaying a couple o ff incoming transactions, even though these transactions are visible on the blockchain. 
* The web interface gives a java.lang.NullPointerException error on the first page, after logging in.
* The mobile wallet app is also not working correctly. 
Aparently they still have a long way to go to restore operations and I think it is strange that they act as if everything is back to normal...

Yes...I've done extensive work in the financial sector and customer that have passed the AML/KYC process are worth a lot. The thing here is that it is either a mystery percentage of the 200K coins to the clients OR a mystery percentage + a share in the revenues of a new exchange with ready to use client accounts.

Almost the same here: it crashes upon startup, even though it does seem to accept my PIN. Tried to uninstall, reïnstall and redo the device pairing, but to no avail. Hope they fix this soon...

You're wrong: the whole severity of the storm that missed earth was recorded by a satelite called STEREO-A, that kept on functioning just fine throughout the full blast (see  Aparently it is possible to make systems resistent to solar storms by design.

The same things he says about Sunlot can be said about him: I have not seen a single shred of evidence that Olivier is fighting the good fight. Just a lot of FUD from him regarding other initiatives AND setting up his own exchange doesn't plead for him being impartial.
Olivier has also been extremely shady about details only known to him, saying stuff like:


The Sunlot plan makes clear that there would be no reuse of code.


How the fuck does he know??


We're not interested in a crusade against MK...we just want our coins back!


Again...how the fuck does he know??


This one takes the cake..."many other things we cannot disclose at this point"....it's MtGox communication all over again!
At least Sunlot recognizes the full BTC debt and status. With the trustee this isn't certain at all, putting everyone's BTC holdings at risk at this very moment.
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:14:34
Yep...there's just no winning here.

Love the pricing and versatility. These are the type of products and applications Bitcoin needs!

Depends on how they organize the refunds, right? Any business out there can implement a BTC refund policy and brick and mortar business would be more inclined to do so, since their wronged costumers, consumer protection organizations and law enforcement easily know where to find them.

Hell yeah...well said.

Come on man...you want to do all criminal investigations all over again? No criminal charges were ever made and with serious stuff like this, even when perpetrated abroad, they will get you when you're back in the US.

Most interesting video so far, Mark Karpeles said:
1. "we are working on it"
2. "leave it to me"
Why is he leaving all this hope alive??
Also, the lawyer said: "we will be looking for new sponsors when the CEO has stepped back."

A sad thing if a class action would be even necessary when corrupt officials are involved. But count me in.

I think his and Gonzague's lawsuits will come when there's proof of their negligence and untruthfulness from the moment they knew something was wrong. For now I would really like the world to know what US government agents were pulling and how nothing has been done to correct their wrongdoings. Five million can really help the victims.

Let's hope the seized funds can get back and be added to the bankruptcy estate.

I think it's messed up that you are already reselling, when all the people that have funded you through your Indiegogo campaign still haven't received their devices yet...

What country are you based? I'm from the Netherlands and still haven't received mine yet.
