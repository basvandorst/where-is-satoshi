all come with non deleteable brand apps, but some more than others. samsung has a lot more than most, and many more knowledgable users root in order to not have those. i have a sony z1, and it's got some apps, like album, playstation mobile, smart connect, walkman and a few more that can't be deleted, but it's not very many. sony does very little compared to samsung to change the base experience. that said, i do really like the sony clock, so much in fact that after switching launchers, i specifically used it instead of the new one that came with the launcher. note- i didn't root this phone, unlike my old htc glacier which i did root in order to use Cyanogen mod

you could root it and install a new rom, then you could be rid of the shitware samsung gives you

600 dollars. &amp;  my rig only cost 700.

thanks, i've got it working, and am getting 148 Mhash/s.

well, i live at home, then will move into college housing later this year, so electricity is no matter to me. also, since you seem to be knowledgeable, do you have a recommended program for mining?
@_date: 2012-07-13 23:04:43
thats what i heard also, i was looking to see if i could just se tit up so when i was afk my GPU could mine. like when i sleep, go to work, and when school starts up, go to class.

thanks for the help. i think this should be the last qeustion, but what should i select for device, cpu affinity, and extra flags?

ok, i've got the folder installed, what do i do from there? sorry for the noob question, i just dont want to accidentally break anything somehow.

i've got a radeon 6850, i did see that it is fairly low on the charts for mining, but hey it's not an nvidia.

so similar to the way slush's pool works? i'm not too knowledgeable at pools.

how does one mine LTC, is it similar to bitcoin? i have a 7850 that's got a beastly aftermarket cooler and overclock that could be put to use heating my room.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:54:39
this is a good idea. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 03:08:39
any hope for a pool?
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:14:39
my 7850 is oc'ed by 25%, so.00375 BTC, or 75 cents a day,that's not too bad except i won't sleep with my rig on because it's got lights. and the good thing is i don't pay for my electricity. do you think it's going to get more or less profitable, similar to how BTC got massively more difficult in the last year? 
@_date: 2013-08-28 17:27:51
that sounds pretty difficult, if someone else wrote the pool program, i'd join but that is way beyond my coding abilities currently.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:33:50
ok, thanks for the answers. i'll probably give it a try.
