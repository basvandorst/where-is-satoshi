My quad beta algo analysis shows a reverse cowgirl is forming in the Bitcoin charts. This has only happened once before with Xerox in early 1970, and we all know how frickin awesome that was! So I decide to dog a little deeper and use my proprietary deep learning high hashrate dapp to determine if the Bollinger bands will fork within the next two days. The analysis shows support is building and new highs will be reached after Christmas. Price target is 22k.

Bitcoin cash went live on coinbase. Bitcoin cash then hoovered up all the monies and tripled in price before receding to a measly 50% gain on the day.

I have been trying to sell and coinbase won't allow it. Largest trade I can do is .11988 and now I can't even do that.
What THE FUCK?! Currency of the future? More like I'd rather have money in world of Warcraft.

Yes it's ducked upstairs where there is a Stirling engine turning it back to electricity. And that electricity is wired back to some of the S9s.

Except it will save billions of dollars for them by moving money through their coin instead of SWIFT.  And people can use apps on their phones and q codes to trade it like all other coins.
