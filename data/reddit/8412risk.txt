A single tx fee is more than their entire garbage economy.

Here is a list of exchanges that support segwit:
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:48:47
Meaning he will tax the shit out of it
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:39:50
He has nothing, just the most expensive iPhone ever made. Poor bastard

I say we fork BCH and call it Trash Cash
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:05
Just don't cough
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:07:09
Now waiting for ledger's official statement on the matter 
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:47:47
That's the joke
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:08:22
Go fuck yourself! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:16:43
Thanks for the link :)
But I wonder about Bitcoin Gold, no one talks about splitting that.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:19:19
Great article!
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:56:08
Or it's rush hour and many are seeing this post. Now what should I do, I'm new to bitcoin and I'm scared I lost my funds :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:31:19
Your account is 3years old with just 6k karma. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:27:13
I'm not sure about this process either. But they both will probably do the same "hacky" action to split. I hope it will go smooth. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:49:50
Dear pool owner sir,
I hope this postcard finds you in good health.
My address is [ALL I HAVE] and my private key is [MAGIC NUMBERS], please send 1 BTC to [NIGERIAN PRINCE]. 
Yours truly,
Dr P. S. Maker.
I trust you to select the right fee,
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:30:30
I'm super cereal
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:44:05
Too low just $3... like 100satoshi/byte
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:55:47
That was the joke
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:10:03
Unless 2x will cause a major dip in btc, and won't be worth much. Bottom line, it's all a gamble.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:10:44
I'll give you 5 oranges for 10 bch
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:51:03
It's a scam!!! Until it reaches 100K
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:15:05
Fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:55:33
I don't have BCH
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:40:46
I always wondered what is actually being sent 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:37:45
My tx you asshole!
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:38:53
that will be 500bits + 1000bits in fees.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:22:42
Technically nothing happened
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:43:14
Pun intended? ;)

How to recognize the zero force buying?
And how low we might fall. Let's say it will be in one year, it will probably double it's value, so we'll drop to $7k? Tnx
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:08:06
You say bull, I say dip before reaching a new ath
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:58:10
2 weeks??? I'll have a heart attack until then
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:10:53
More like if you have any kind of i3/5/7 and all modern AMD processors.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:44:55
Yes. It's back to $7000+
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:44:53
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:52:51
Add another 3 zeros and you got Tezos

Get rich first.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:23:56
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:02:35
No it was finally cancelled! Got it back in my wallet :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:21:39
What I meant: AMD has something similar. 
Botton line: you want security use a casio calulator
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:28:51
My stuck transaction: 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:45:32
Something for your trouble.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:25:19
Fuck that
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:31:39
Will it ever?

RemindMe! 1 year

I used custom fee of 100/byte
Copay wallet
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:59:02
Thanks, I feel less stressed now
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:10:58
Taking advice from forbes...
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:27:24
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:56:58
How did you calculate this?
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:51:16
That's nothing. Elon Musk grew hair after his first exit.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:39:19
So was bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:23:40
Ltc is the glew
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:08:53
5 hours after you do, eth will double and btc will drop :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:08:08
Fake news
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:17:07
It's all good now, thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:28:24
To the �� 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:25:28
I think you good Trezor as well, they care.
Most people are not very tech, so more step by step should become available as we approach the split date
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:15:26
AMD has a similar "management".
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:54:19
That I'm worried about my btc?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:43:09
He should pay to beat them up
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:23:26
I asked about my tx stuck for 21 hours and was marked as spam :( I'm just new and worried. I don't even have bch.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:08:58
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:39:38
He's just stupid
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:22:16
That painting is like BTC after it moons
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:41:44
I appreciate your sympathy.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:57:46
Like 10 hours ago I thought it got dropped, because I saw the coins in my wallet again. But now it seems it got confirmed and went to the destination wallet.
I'm confused, what happened?
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:11:38
My edits describe each step of the way.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:57:16
Guys, i'm just really worried about my coins and you're not helping
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:52:54
I just want my btc back :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:30:01
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:45:19
I tried for the first to set a custom low fee of 100/byte costs like $3.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:45:50
How long until it drops?
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:19:32
The dumbest show on TV
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:53:42
What if my fee is too low, does it change anything?
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:35:33
The Chinese government probably was the one doing all the buying
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:19:05
Jamie Dimon is a scam artist! He used his influence to make the price drop then jp morgan bought.
