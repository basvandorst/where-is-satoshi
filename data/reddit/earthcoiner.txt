Let me start by getting my negative opinion out first. Most people don't give back to other people. Modern capitalism is built on taking from others. Those with more need to give more to those with less. Call it socialist idealism or whatever but I believe modern society will fail without the basic instinct to provide for others. If there is any reason why a salvage operation is not possible, it is simply that of selfish greed. The human race is simply not emotionally evolved enough for this kind of global love, and maybe never will be.
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO PROVE THE ABOVE STATEMENT WRONG??????? I thought that was what the bitcoin community was about? Doing something different, more efficient, outside of corrupt institutions?
Now for the positive statement.
I think a relief fund would be the only way to give back. A separate thing from any new exchange or bit/alt venture. Of course gaining access to the records showing the fiat or coin in user accounts would be the first problem. If it were possible for gox users to prove what was in their account/s then they would have exclusive membership to this relief fund and its benefits. Participating exchanges may even give special offers to ex gox users (such as no trading fees up to a given date or volume, or discount fiat buy in rates). The point is that it is possible give. The first thing the major bitcoin community did was distance itself from gox. They suggested that they wish to rebuild bitcoin user confidence and trust? Well actions speak louder then words.
I welcome all criticisms, cracks, and ideas.
