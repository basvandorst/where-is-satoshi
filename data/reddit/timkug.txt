Roll it over into a Traditional IRA and then buy GBTC (Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Charles Shwab all have GBTC).  That is an easier way to go tax-wise, also.

In Germany it is illegal to deny the holocaust.  Does this make them an authoritarian police state or are they trying to avoid that happening again.

Buying an ETN is much cheaper than setting up an LLC, plus you are taking the risk of doing something wrong which will cause all of you pre-tax investment to be taxed and early withdraw fees.  I have had a self-directed IRA with Bitcoin IRA but now the custodian, Kingdom Trust, has massively increased their fees, so I am moving back to the stock market.

Correct.  I use CXBTF which is on Nasdaq since last week.  Everyone can already use their IRAs to buy BTC.

You can play the short game or the long game.  The short game takes a lot more luck.  Your best bet is to slowly take profits over time and not to sell it all because fiat never increases in value.  Only invest what you don't need for over a year.

Ledger Nano S or X for hardware wallet.  Coinbase is a fine on-ramp to use.  If you do crypto to crypto trading (which I don't recommend) then you will want a KuCoin account for better fees and to avoid U.S. eyes (they are in Hong Kong).  Crypto to crypto is a taxable event, so I wouldn't do that on Coinbase.  If they do give any info to the IRS, they will send you a 1099.  Just buy and hold for the long term and have a plan of when to take profits (make that plan now and stick to it).

Coins are money.
Tokens are placeholders to redeem something like a service - think of an old arcade where you bought tokens to play video games, the token had no real value outside of the arcade.
Shares are a stock or partial ownership in an asset like a business.

It is not like stocks, you can buy any fraction.  You could buy $5 worth if you wanted.  ATMs will get  you in fees and spread, use an exchange.  It will take a while to get your fiat there, that is what makes crypto so much better.

The risk to reward is incredible.  I would guess 10% it goes to zero and 90% it goes up 10x.  Timing is tough, so only gamble with money you don't need for a few years and try not to look at the price every day (or every few hours like I do).  Once you 3x, take your initial investment out, then half out every double after that - or whatever plan you come up with.  Write it down and don't change your mind later when greed sets in.

There is an easier and safer way.  When you write down your list, switch lines 9 &amp; 10 or whatever you will remember and put it in a safe.  Use 2 ledgers (cloned by restoring the second one with the phrase) and put them in different places, at least one in a different building.  If one is compromised, get to the other fast and move fund to an exchange (temporarily).  You don't need a bank vault.

The borrowed money doesn't actually exist, the exchange is not lending it.  The bets are sideline bets between two people - one long against one short.  It is called a zero sum game since someone has to lose money in order for someone to make money.  No BTC is actually bought or sold, they just settle the difference.  The winner would not be the exchange other than fees, the real winner would be the whale manipulating the market to make money on his side betting.

@_date: 2018-04-12 12:14:04
A lot of people were "shorting" the market which means betting that BTC would go down.  Margin trading is betting with partially borrowed money, like 2x up to 100x.  That increases your volatility up to 100x.  If BTC goes up $100 then you get $10k, but if it goes down a little, you will lose it all before the borrowed money comes into play.  That is called being liquidated.

Most don't expect it to pass, so I doubt the price will drop.  We have all gotten out hopes up for this too many times.  Plus we are now in a bull market.  Tether and Binance hack had no effect.

Making it illegal is the best they can do.  At the bottom of the bear market, the U.S. could have made it illegal and destroyed the price much further, but they didn't which was great.  They see value in it even though it is a threat.  One day it will be too big to be destroyed, but that day hasn't come yet.  Maybe after two more bull runs when we actually have adoption.

Bitcoin can function at any price, so unlike stocks it is not tied to anything physical.  The price will be what the world decides and that is something very new.  The news affects it, its popularity affects it, regulation affects it, and sometimes (not as often as people think) it is manipulated by whales.  Without investors, the price would be stable and slowly grow with adoption.  As the ratio of investors vs. users shifts to the users being the vast majority, the price will settle on a random number and become less volatile.

There are long term trends.  I believe we have already entered the next bull run.  It will still go up and down wildly, but the overall trend will be up for the next couple years.  The risk to reward is very good right now.  Have a plan before you start so that greed doesn't take over.

I was downvoted for saying this in another place, but I think it is true and people just blame the messenger.
1.  If the stock market slowly crashes, that is good for BTC.  If it crashes like 1929, that is bad for everything.
2.  If small countries fight or go banckrupt, that is good for BTC.  If it becomes WW3, that is bad for everything.
People are driven by Greed &amp; Fear.  Greed drives the price up; Fear will drive it down.
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:50:54
Too early and too risky for this.  Also go thru an exchange, I imaging ATMs get horrible rates.  Whatever % of your money you will not need to touch for a few years is what you should invest, and it also shouldn't be over 50% of your net worth.  Your age plays a roll and you can be more risky when you are younger vs. close to retirement.
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:21:55
BTC is a safer bet than ETH or any other Alt.  You have to decide the risk, I keep 85% in BTC and over the last 4 years, that has been my best performer, alts jump up and down and I've had a few go to zero.
Short term timing is impossible.  In the next week, I expect a big move up or down since it has been coiling, but who knows which way.  You could put half in now and wait for a pullback, go all in now, or DCA.  It is all risk to reward so there is no best way.  Don't put anything in that you will need for at least a year.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:05:07

Put it in Coinbase cold storage (will take several days to get out - that is part of the security), that is a pretty safe option.  Once the balance gets big, move to a hardware wallet.  If you are starting with a decent amount, then get a Ledger Nano S for $50 (new, never used) - that is the safest option.

 Is coinbase even good to buy bitcoin? 
It is a good on ramp from fiat.  Then go to Binance or Bittrex to trade crypto to crypto.  Coinbase Pro is fine too, but very limited in coins.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:30:54
No, it is not too late, I think there will be at least 2 more big bull/bear markets before mass adoption.
DCA (Dollar cost average) will be a better method for you, psychologically.  Also stay with Bitcoin and don't trade.  These two things will limit your risk/reward.  Timing the market and gambling with alts are not for the faint of heart, most people lose doing this (like I have, I wish I had played it safer, now I can't seem to stop).

People who hold USDT don't want BTC.  They are much more likely to trade for a safer USD backed coin like TrueUSD (TUSD).  As TUSD goes up well over a dollar, some will be convinced to go to USD or maybe another coin.  Since each Tether is only backed by $0.76, that should be its value, but this is crypto and there are no rules.  Crypto does whatever the F it wants.  If people think Tether should drop the price of BTC, then it will.  If people don't care that Tether is not truely backed, then it won't matter.

Coinbase has Cold Storage which is safer than Coinbase Pro (old name gdax).  If you are moving it to trade, consider Binance or Bittrex.  Unless you mean moving USD to buy BTC on Coinbase Pro.  In that case, the fees saved is usually lost from price movement in the week it takes to move fiat.

Start slowly and with BTC.  Personally, I would wait for a pullback right now, but I am not psychic.  90% of alts go to zero.  Think of them as penny stocks, you can get rich, but you will probably under perform BTC, especially if you trade around a lot.

Trezor T, Nano S, and Nano X are all as safe as you can get.  Don't buy used, could be compromised.  Never type your restore keys on a computer, hand write and secure.  Always test with small amounts first so you understand how it works.  Move a small amount to your hardware wallet, reset the wallet, and then restore it again with your hand written keys.  Lastly, have a plan of when to take profits and when to sell.  Greed will take over later.  Something like, when it triples, take out initial investment, then every double take out half.  If you are only buying a small amount, then maybe take out half once BTC gets close to $50k.  HODL is great in a bull market and terrible in a bear market, learn to recognize which one we are in.  I got in 2015 and wish I had this advice, expensive lessons.  Good luck and welcome.

Yes.  Nothing is more secure than a hardware wallet (cold storage).  Coinbase's cold storage is 2nd best - you have to trust them.
It will store your private keys and use them to send transactions without the computer knowing the keys.  NEVER type your private keys into a computer or anything that can go online.  You will have a backup phrase to write down and put in a safe, never put that on a computer either.  Ledger has good info on their site, it is not hard to learn and important to understand how it works.  You are now the bank.

That is illegal.  Wash-Sale rule: can't buy back identical one for 30 days.
The above guy is right.

It allows people to buy and spend crypto without the learning curve and risk of holding and storing their own keys.  It also allows instant payment and acceptance from retailers to accept crypto and receive cash.  Institutions can invest large amounts in crypto and not worry about being hacked because it is insured.  Think of it as a bank that does not do fractional reserve lending.  It is centralized which has benefits to people not willing to be their own bank.  This is the way to introduce it to the masses, by going thru businesses first who pass on some of the savings to customers.  You and I will still use decentralized and others will too, but it is not for everyone.
Bakkt will be buying Bitcoin OTC, so it will have a slower effect on the price.  The best thing we can hope for is slow steady rise in value to get everyone on board.

What?  You didn't like the 80s?

In the U.S. most people are speculating on future price.  In the 3rd world, they are using it as intended.  Both of these things will lead to mass adoption and hopefully a better world.  It could also go the other way and lead to greater oversight with centralized digital currencies.  Time will tell.  The internet is amazing and horrible at the same time.  Cell phones are great and terrible, too.

Yes.  The market moves because of fear and greed.  Sometimes it is manipulated for greed, but most of the time it is just herd mentality.

When you don't know which way it is going to go, do nothing.  Wait until you know, ...and even then you'll probably be wrong.

At some point, we all do something like this.  Especially in this space.  I have had very expensive lessons with trading and hacked exchanges.

Yes, with a 10x leverage.  If BTC drops by 10%, then you lose it all.  
But when has BTC ever dropped by 10% out of nowhere? /s

You mean Oversold.  It is undervalued according to the Mayer Multiple.

Really depends on the amount of money.  You risk putting $200 in your wallet even though you could get pick pocketed.  You wouldn't walk around with $10,000 in your pocket, at that point you want a bank or safe.

Exchanges get hacked, people get scammed.  The downside of decentralization is that you are in charge of security.  You can buy a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet for $50 on Amazon (never buy a used one) and store most of your crypto very safely on it.  Then move small amounts to a mobile wallet for spending.  This will limit your risk to the same as cash.
If you don't want to mess with a hardware wallet, buy small amounts using Coinbase and use their mobile app to spend.  The USD you keep on their exchange is FDIC insured up to $250k.  If you buy too much crypto, move some to their cold storage for safety - the downside is it takes several days to get it out of cold storage which is part of the security.

Sometimes it is just very confusing, hopefully it is nothing.  I thought something similar happened to me sending  Ethereum.  I thought I had been hacked, didn't recognize the address and it looked like it was going the wrong way.  It turned out to be nothing, just a confusing interface.  It all settled fine.
