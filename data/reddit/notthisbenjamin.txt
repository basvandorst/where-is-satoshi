But again, you're not providing any good reason for it (and by good reason, I mean one that is backed by strong, hard facts).
So yeah, saying "it feels wrong because I have differing opinions" is not how it works. Especially in a trial.

It's exactly like saying "I just shot a gun, which is not illegal. It's totally not my fault that this guy was between the wall and me holding the gun and shooting it. Shooting the gun isn't illegal, is it?"
Try that defense in court, see how it goes.

So, you honestly believe someone would offer you a 30% discount just because they're really nice people and you just look like someone they'd really get along with or something like that?

Are you shocked that criminals may get their bank account closed?You are not reflecting very well on bitcoin when you say that, just so you know.

It's the massive list of evidence laid out in the trial.
You're making claims they're faked (where is your reason for that? Do you have special insider information). You're making the incredible claim, it's now for you to provide evidence.
That's how it works. You don't become a clever person by just beginning to shout "it was very obviously just faked, you're all being manipulated" and thinking you're a top mind and an independent thinker.

Which it has provided.
If you want to claim it's all false evidence, you now need to prove it and why not, challenge the decision (or help do so, I mean, if you're so confident, why don't you you make justice is duly served?)

The narrative is only backed by evidence.
I'm still waiting for you to provide us with the damning evidence it never happened.
I'm sure you have it, you wouldn't just be making claims like that, right?

I hope you ask for proof when somebody shows up to claim the evidence was planted or that he was innocent.

Sure, if you discount, you know... All the solid evidence (some of them actually material).
Which is a lot more than the edited narrative you yourself are trying to offer.
At least, the evil State backed it up with factual evidence. I'm still waiting for yours (you'd think after 5 comments you'd have a tiny bit of the beginning of something).
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:27:09
Sure, where's your irrefutable evidence?

When are you going to provide your evidence of his innocence now that his guilty has been demonstrated and proven in a trial?
