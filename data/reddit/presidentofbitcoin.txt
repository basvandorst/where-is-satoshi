if you have reasonable consideration thinking bitcoin will fizzle away for some new currency, you can easily diversify into one of the many 'bitcoin 2.0' currencies pleading for investment dollars.

Great idea, but the same exposures that make bitcoin wallets vunerable would make security features like withdrawal limits vunerable, since the aggressor would have access to your system from the start.

Really interesting how this might play out.
Does Mark really know where the remaining funds are secured?  If so, is he secretly letting insiders behind this buyout know so they essentially get to buy out 500K+ BTC from desperate users at 20% cost AND Mark gets to walk away with a clean slate?
Sounds just like how subprime lending scams are done in the traditional fiat system.

It could also be the natural tenacity bred from constantly being told bitcoin has failed, is a ponzi, is libertarian nonsense, that we are all fools, ad infinitum.....
But yet, here we still are. Growing everyday, with younger minds and incredible talent. Even many hardcore naysayers are stopping short of renouncing their previous claims of bitcoin is dead with statements like "well, i can see the value in the technology" and there is "tremendous potential."
But there will always be angry old men, sitting in a room and whimsing about the glory days they had. Their failure to see the future will be their failure to adapt.  Bitcoin is fresh, not attached to mainstream media or corporate golf outings.  Its working up all night, coding for fun, being a geek because you dont give a shit.  
When did unbridled optimism become such a bad thing in economics.  The constant onslaught of war/disease/fear mongering that goes on in the modern civilized world is quickly approaching downright fucking Orwellian levels. Bitcoin is the antithesis to this mindset.

'Cash discount' is a just a spin on saying 'no service charge' for using credit cards.  The only reason small shops have them is because large chains often have the leverage to strike sweetheart deals with charge rates and minimum fees.
