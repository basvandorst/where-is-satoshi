If you read the full post maybe you would understand. I passed the full KYC/AML. I had nothing to hide and I provided them with every document they requested in 2013-2014, also in 2016-2017. I passed it without an issue.
I did not use my account for 2 years now, the reason they closed my account is: “The decision to terminate your Account has been reached following a close examination of your recent account activity”.
I did not make even a $1 withdraw or deposit. Eitherway I feel sorry that you think money-laundering or whatever scheme you think just because I had a withdraw of 60k.
I had withdrawals of over 200-300K in Kraken, no issue with AML/KYC. Also a Tier 4 verification. 
As I stated: I DO NOT MISS MY ACCOUNT. I just want to let others know to be careful when using shady exchanges because one of you might lose a lot.

You are right, I used a wrong term. They just became judge, jury and executioner exchange. Do whatever the hell want.
My post was to inform what happened so others be careful with them so no one losses any money, other than that I am not looking to get my account back or whatever from them. Thats all

Oh one more thing, even if I did something bad I deserve to be notified prior or if possible to give a reason. I hope it does not happen to you so you wont be "mad that they found out"

Thank God no funds in there. I said I did not use my account for 2 years. No activity at all, and they say based on recent activity we terminated your account

Did you bother to read my friend? I did not have any transactions from 2017. In the past I provided them with all the necessary documents. My proof of funds, statements and everything else.
Anyway I do not need your negativity but either way just want to clear that up. If they would find something bad they had 2 years to close my account.   
I do not need an account from them since there is plenty of exchanges, I felt like to inform others who use that exchange to try and stay away.
Take care.
