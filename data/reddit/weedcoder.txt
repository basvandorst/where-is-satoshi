thx for the reentry point :)

the world is realizing the fiat scam. it's a very old scam, it lasted *thousand* years. so the feeling is weird but it's ok to want bitcoin as *the* currency

@_date: 2016-06-19 16:00:40
because dollar is shit
@_date: 2016-06-16 11:19:07
It would be great to see 1 USD value against total cryptocoins.
I want to see the chart of the dollar (and all fiats) crash!
@_date: 2016-06-26 19:37:29
ok my bad
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:30:08
i read  and i know how to avoid this shit
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:43:00
there is a lot of fud on bitcoin.
not scaling, segwit bugs, high fees, bitcoin unlimited, bitcoin xt, better ethereum, bad reputaion of a core dev, bitcoiner license, mtgox again, speculative attack... let your imagination go
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:01:38
this takes a very long time.
Quality assurance is made on testnets and you can run beta client on them to see new features...
On the official github, take a look at pull requests
@_date: 2016-06-12 12:39:17
there are so many hardware things to do in crypto...
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:58:35
not a competitor. what hurts eth hurts btc. and vice versa
@_date: 2016-06-22 09:43:32
if you run bitcoin core client, keep it up to date.
you can double spend the transaction to get it replaced
in the help menu of bitcoin core, open the debug window
go to console tab
type help
type help abandontransaction
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:05:23
many others

there are between 4 and 6 BTC in mempool now
2016-06-15T19:00:00Z it was 11 BTC
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:29:05
i hodl.
i told my employer that now it's with bitwage.com that i get paid.
whatever the value in fiat, i hodl, i buy.
i don't sell, i spend.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:53:15
apple VS bananas
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:30:37
bitcoin is here to replace them.
i DGAF about politics, i want to be governed by consensus algorithms.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:51:58
the same

Note that these regulations are applied to people and companies/organisations. a protocol can't be regulated because a protocol is a regulation. There will be legal dumping following regulation of people and companies usage of cryptocurrencies.

The red wall is not China, it's ugly people that do not hodl.
The green wall is not USA, it's China.

the bubble will burst on scaling fud?
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:29:52
you can't cancel.
you can add a second transaction with the first unconfirmed transaction as input.
you attach double the fee on the second transaction.
miners will mine them both.
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:44:06
and the answer is always the same.
RBF is double spend by using abandontransaction in bitcoincore client, and redo the tx with higher fee
wait 72h to the transaction to be droped and use abandontransaction in bitcoincore client, and redo the tx.
CPFP is asking the recipient to add a second transaction with double the fee with the stuck unconfirmed transaction as input.

new blocks need to be broadcasted as fast as possible.
there are two ways of improvement for scalability:
block enlargement, BIP 101 to 109
block thining, BIP 141 to 145 and 152
this is for core implementation
XT, unlimited, classic have other interesting views.
extra thin block (XThin) worth some reading.
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:49:09
take a look at bitwage.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:33:58
layer 3, you don't need a chain anymore!
@_date: 2016-09-04 15:16:31
race condition.
longest chain wins (the first with another block on top)
shortest chain loose and the block is orphaned.
orphaned block txs which are not in winning block go back to mempool.

you need to trust or sign Wlad's public key.
    $ gpg --sign-key laanwj
    $ gpg --edit-key laanwj
or use a UI for your gpg.

There are 1.x and 2.x TSS TPM
The TSS OSS lib is trousers
TPM has a system of ownership and ask passphrase to do things involving private keys.
TPM has also some small slot to store, but TSS has functions to store encrypted material on disk. NO ONE can access TPM private key. So i think best is for M2M use cases.

What was this size in bytes of this transaction?
