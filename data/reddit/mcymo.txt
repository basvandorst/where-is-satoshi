Occam's razor says somebody could have been paid. You now may add other methods which are a lot simpler and closer to Occam's razor than the full technical pwn theory.

See, that's the thing about the universe, it really doesn't care about what you think, but it's hard to believe the actual extend, you would require enough processing power to simulate the entire universe, yet, still. Why don't you write the physicists, maybe you'll make something out of yourself with your cow-theory, I'm sure they're as impressed as I am, but don't write a psychologist, because they're just bored by underdeveloped forms of self-interest guided re-rationalizing. Really bored. It might take the processing....

...and then you start to suspect that for every story you see in the paper, somebody, somewhere has the same reaction you just did.

Doesn't really go into the first question, which was:  
  
A.G.:*The FED has expanded it's balance sheets by 1 trillion plus, who has received that money? Have you any kind of investigation going on.*  
  
IG: *I wouldn't call it an investigation, I'd call it high level review and no, although that happened 8 months ago, we don't know. Also we are limited in our jurisdicition.*    
  
  
A.G.: *If you're not responsible, who is?*  
  
I.G.:\*says some incoherent thins and then says\*: *Can you repeat the question, please.  
  
A.G.: \*repeating the question he asked before that question\*  
  
Silly A.G..  
 
  
Keep walking people, nothing going on here.

Actually, a fake call center is a reasonable concern, because you can set it up as easily as you can install asterisk, and for your derogative, uneducated post: Top physicists are still trying to find proof whether or not this universe is a simulation and it's entirely possible.

Say, wouldn't be a return to the gold standard impossible, since if you would match the [entire amount of dollars in circulation]( in "amount of dollar = ounce of gold" [the price would be very different]( from the [actual price]( you can buy gold for? ([Assuming 5.6 10^9 oz gold in existence](

I think it's a bit of a problem, that people trade Bitcoin against Fiat-money. If you trade it too much, I don't think you have understood one of the problems BC tried to solve in the first place, which is money generation out of thin air. If you consider them equal, you will trade a finite, against an infinite resource. This means banks/financial institutions again could buy the whole fucking network before it got to the point were people could actually use it for their everyday needs, like electricity, food.... . Please tell my I'm wrong. Is there something I can read that considers these kinds of problems?
