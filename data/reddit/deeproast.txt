HFT in the real sense is not possible with bitcoin markets.  To little volume and to little trading pairs. Plus the API's generally only tick per minute not by the nanosecond. 
Some exchanges are different and offer websockets for less than 1 minute trading but there are still limits and from a true HFT perspective is an eternity in comparison.
What is volumizer?  Curious as I've written and run my own trading bots/servers/databases.

I would agree with that if greed wasn't a factor.  Often those who are strong enough to be able to help others tend to have a mentality of self-preservation over group preservation.  Why give if I can keep and only get stronger. 
That's also why I have mixed emotions on all these good things some billionairs are doing now by donating their money to charity.  Yes it's great NOW they are billionaires but noone looks on the fact they often had to step on a lot of people, and push a lot of people down to get there.  
If I become a multi-millionaire by paying people min-wage and no benefits, then years later say well now that I'm comfortable I'll give back.  I think it's more responsible to do it slowly and sustainably on the way up.

Guess I'm on the "pollution" team.  Last I checked the entire blockchain was 40gigs, I couldn't evne run it on one of my VPS nodes.
What is the purpose of these additions? Couldn't the blockchain be limited to just Tx history/verification and use a forked chain for extra stuff not necessary to bitcoin?

Those show data, but do no (as far as I know) allow you to download past data.  I have 1.5 years of market data in recorded.  If there is value in selling it even cheap/modest, will look into doing so just to cover server cost of recording said data.  $15/month is cheap, but when you're broke, homeless, it's an expense. Basically looking short term to keep things alive till I get back on my feet.
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:37:09
So for Marriage licenses and the various things popping up arount Bitcoin they really aren't storying the raw binary document (text, image, etc) in the blockchain.  It's just a hash to prove it existed?  
So the blockchain is essentially acting like a notary? Need proof this file existed on 6/19/15 hash it, and show the hash existed in the blockchain?  Hope I'm understanding this right.  If so that makes A LOT more sense and not as bad as I was thinking.
My next question is simply why?  Seems like we're shoehorning something not intended into a simple transaction ledger. What does bitcoin gain from this? Does it make transactions faster, security of the coin better? If not then I don't see how it's relevant to the core meaning of a coin.

But at the same time people in their 40's with multiple kids shouldn't HAVE to work a job flipping burgers, because some greedy CEO decided it was best to close shop and move to China. They should be able to keep and work toward better employment.

What is the end user for this kind of tech?  Seems a bit much for the scenerio you mentioned but that did help me understand the concept a bit.
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:18:54
Thank you, though I'm trying to grasp the concept of decentralization specifically. 
Think of it like this.  Bitcoin just comes out,  100 people from all over the world download it and run. There is no master node.
Well, how do they find each other?  That's why we have a master node.  Now the client all points to this master as a seeding value. It finds the blockchain and finds other people.  
But what happens if there are 0 master nodes after that initial seeding of x clients?  People will still talk back and forth between each other. "Hey find anybody new?"  "Sure here is there address".
Over time clusters form as well as weak links. Once those weak links sever each cluster is left on it's own.  That's where I'm curious of fragmentation or forking.  Since they are working off their own blockchain post network break, they'll handle their own cluster transactions.
From a programming point of view I can't see how any network code can be truly decentralized because at the minimum you're always going to need a master node just to keep order and everyone talking to each other.
LT;dr  Can bitcoin survive with 0 master nodes? If so how and how do you keep from fragmenting into clusters? If it requires a master now how can it be considered decentralized since master nodes are the point of failure.

I love bitcoin but can you imagine if this was real.  The blockchain would be completely full and 100 TB in a year if it recorded every persons on/off per lightbulb, TV, etc.  Giving absolutely no value to bitcoin itself instead using the tech and piggybacking on our blockchain.  Why not have a custom blockchain?
If you really want to shoehorn stuff like this into blockchain, why not have your own app that utilizes your own blockchain network. Say Chevy has their own blockchain,  Ford their own.  Then their apps can only turn on cars they made.

To be fair, the writeup is shit. However it is legit to scan for miner software.  It's common (even I was affected recently)  
Some people pack miners within a trojan payload to make the infected machines mine.  This happened to me recently when I downloaded the Intellect coin wallet. 
Not only did it install a miner 2 weeks later.  It also allowed remote desktop access.   The guy used my computer to login to my cryptsy account and stole all 3 of my BTC.

@_date: 2015-09-27 05:51:05
Um no.  As a pool you are basically acting like one massive mining operation.   When they mine a block they get the rewards. Then they look at all the people in their pool and based on your strength you get a share.  Based on the # of shares you earned vs the total shares out there. You get a % of what bitcoin reward was earned.  So they then deposit your portion of the bitcoin into your wallet.

"Next he wants to try out his magic service but wait he needs some Bitcoin"
If he's relying on the 21 ASIC for development and using ONLY the btc he gets from mining, he's going to be waiting a loooong time before he has enough BTC to be meaningful.
Would be like giving someone a truck to make a cross country trip, but the truck only creates 1 cup of fuel a day.  So he has to wait months, if not a year for enough to accumulate to even try driving.

This seems to be what confuses me.  WHY would you need to use bitcoin just to share data between devices? When a simple network ASIC + tcp stack  is what is going to do the work anyway (since the bitcoind will be piggybacking off of that anyway). Just seems like they are shoehorning blockchain tech into things that really don't need it.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:06:19
Awesome!  Bookmarked ^_^
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:35:09
$10 arduino and some shields for a network and tcp stack voila!  
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:34:23
So we will have to pay 1 cent in BTC to remotely ask my lightbulb to turn off. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:05:15
But this can all be done now with core blockchain. The only ISSUE is how small these payments are.  
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:38:29
If the car is that smart there could be a simple phone app  + tcp connection + internet + cryptography to do it. No need for recording all activity everywhere and having to pay to unlock your car.

@_date: 2015-09-23 06:31:22
Mind going into more detail?  IoT is basically tcp access to ordinary household items right? Smart Lightbulbs, Smart Refrigerators etc.
How does having an actual ASIC generating almost pointless amount of btc useful.

Guy buys 21c enabled phone. Awesome! All the free stuff I'll get because this thing will make me free money.
Guy:  I'd like to buy that movie.
Store:  Ok that'll be $10 in BTC here is my 21 terminal
Guy: Here is my cell phone to scan.
Store: Um you have $0.02 
Guy: What?! I've had this thing for months, that's all it's created!
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:56:52
Then what are they about?  If it's about the transactions and not about the mining.  Then why mine at all and simple develop software that allows transactions.  Oh we have that bitcoind. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 05:49:13
or blackcoin via Halo
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:15:17
Well the idea behind this seems to be for machine to machine transactions.  Basically my cell phone runs a program that says turn on my light bulb at home.   So it then creates a transaction where I send 1 cent to my light bulb with the command to turn itself on.
The bulb sits there checking the blockchain and sees OH I have a new deposit, lets see what the embedded payload of the TX says. Ok let me turn myself on.
That's why it's micropayments. Granted it wont be a full penny, maybe 100th or 1000th of a cent.  But still it's piggybacking on top of a financial instrument (Bitcoin) to utilize it's ledger as a communication infrastructure.
It's shit and wasteful of blockchain resources. All of this would be moot once the Internet goes full IPv6 and every damn device or lightbulb in the world can have it's own address.  Add some crypto and toss over the internet and voila, same solution.
They're just using bitcoin network as the transfer medium. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:02:20


Incorrect an ASIC only generates a lot of possible hash's.  Simple as that, it has nothing to do with accessing the blockchain, transactions (other than validating a hash).  Point is there is 0 need to have a mining ASIC.
It's all in the software to do the magic, and honestly all that can be done now via RPC calls to bitcoind.  So all you need is a SBC + network hardware + tcp stack.  Which can be done with a pi, hell even an arduino. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:28:37
Didn't answer the question.  Why would it need a ASIC miner to do bitcoin transaction?  That can all be done with a standard core bitcoind and RPC calls. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 08:59:12
Still don't see the need for hardware this is purely a software stack.  The only reason the hardware would need to be involved is to get some bitcoin via their ASIC but with the shit return might as well buy some or buy another more ROI-friendly ASIC. 
Since their software runs on Linux why couldn't they just release a VM image?
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:58:06

Agree plus noone would seriously CPU mine bitcoin anymore.  so minerd is likely an infection.  I don't even ASIC mine anymore because my asics are so old.   &lt; 20GH total
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:58:41
How is this any different than a R-Pi with any other ASIC miner out there?
I have a Pi now with several ASICS.  I could do the exact same thing and have been doing it longer than 21 has existed.  
@_date: 2015-09-23 08:48:43
Pretty much any 21 post talking about using bitcoin blockchain and their own ASICS to even mine bitcoin to use in transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-23 09:01:29
"It uses the bitcoin to "write" to the blockchain."  So any computer with bitcoind could run the software. Still no need for hardware. Is there anything hardware specific that isnt an ASIC that helps in the scheme of things? If not then it's purely software and could be put into a VM appliance and distributed to developers.
@_date: 2015-09-29 07:41:41
Since when is it any of their business how you go money. Just that you have it.

If it's a payment issue then wallet to wallet is just fine.
Why should I have to pay 1 penny of BTC to turn on a freaking lightbulb in my house and announce to the world (and store on all the worlds wallets) that I did that.

@_date: 2015-09-23 06:52:29
Concept is sound but still all you need is a small SBC like a Pi running bitcoind and do RPC calls.  Making transactions has nothing to do with a miner that will never generate enough btc to be meaningful. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:26:56
Why would a IoT device need blockchain access?  Smart lightbulbs, Radios, etc.  How would having access to a financial network be at all useful?  The only thing I can think of is a Smart Refrigerator that orders food automatically but why Bitcoin and why would it need it's own mining chip that honestly would never pay itself back in BTC.
@_date: 2015-11-18 06:12:27
Maybe sell a .img for a couple bucks on a website.  A lot of people have Pi's out there collecting dust.   Bought for a project, abandoned or just stopped using it. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 07:51:28
So I'm guessing you deposit bitcoin it autosells for fiat giving you a pre-paid debit card that you can refill by depositing BTC instead of more money?
Timing means A LOT.  I'd hate to deposit $1k worth of BTC when it's at $330 then see it go back to $200.  If they auto sell it would be nice, but if they waited and held... then that $1k worth $600.
To many variables, need more info to assess risk. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 06:47:30
I'm anxious to see how the market reacts post Jan 16 with the whole blocksize debacle.  If we have a fork I suspect we'll have a nice sized dip below 200 hell maybe even 100-120.   
If that happens I'm going balls deep and buying as much as I can. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:11:42
Using your analogy then yes technically it could be like saying the device is not just a computer since it can play movies.  But it can only play movies that are black and white and 64x64 pixels. 
As a mining rig it's useless, as a computer it's nothing more than a Pi you can already get.  The only thing that may be useful or interesting is their API but so far I'm not impressed. 
Since it boils down to just an API then why even make a hardware device?
Seriously they could have just bought a Pi- tossed on a cheap used Antminer and it's the exact same thing from a hardware perspective. 
They should have just skipped the hardware and just released a SDK.
@_date: 2015-11-21 07:54:35
Agree I've been into it for almost 2 years now and I still can't find an easy way to buy BTC with USD.  That doesn't require a ton of id, ssn, birth certificate, bill showing address, first born son.

No reason to pay someone to hold 10k units, only to sell 1k units, to another person who buys 500 units, then the last guy who buys 10-20 for resell.  Let me just buy 1-2 from the company or 1st level distributor that had 10k.

Sorry was confused by the title. I thought it means I could ebay stuff and use bitcoin as a payment method for buying or selling. In my mine ebay + paypal is the same thing.   Not sell my bitcoin to a 3rd party company which deposits fiat into paypal. 
Paypal holding bitcoin to spend at merchants is a LOT different than paypal holding money, it received from selling off Bitcoin. 
How is this any different than say cryptsy or any other site that lets your sell bitcoin for fiat and take the resulting money out as an ACH transfer?

Eh, there is a lot of bitcoin to be had by mining and trading crap coins. I was a CPU miner starting with doge last Jan and only mined for 2 months.  Probably made less than a single GPU miner made in a week.
But turned that into almost 3 BTC within a year via careful TA and trading, all in altcoins. Then mintpal stole it. lol  So I chalk 2014 to a great learning experience and starting from scratch again, except knowledge. gained.

They should add bitcoin to the name.  To be honest there are 100's of wallets out there for all the altcoins.
Hearing  "X Wallet" makes me think X is the coin name.
I'd be more interested if someone recommend Electrum Bitcoin wallet 2.0 so I have a least a frame of reference.

Heck I'm trying to make my own crypto company and I found out about this via dogecoin last Jan. The ease of quick reward of actually getting something from mining gets people excited. Which is harder to do now with Bitcoin.  Now I have ASIC miners, custom made software for trading in 3 markets, etc.

First isn't new, second possibly.   So I could give these guy my paypal account and I could received it as BTC?  That would stream line things a bit.  
So essentially I can buy bitcoin using my paypal funds to get BTC?  What are the fees?  
I've used  many times to get dogecoin using paypal funds.  Then sell for BTC (or just keep the dogecoin).  
But their markup is really high.  If there would be a way to buy straight BTC with paypal funds this would be awesome.
