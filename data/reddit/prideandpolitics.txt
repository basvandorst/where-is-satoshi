Crypto is also a currency, not just an investment.

I seriously doubt that anyone would jump on FedCoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:55:50
The Fed bank will annihilate anything in its path, it will not stop until it has either slaughtered or enslaved everyone.

They play by the rules that they write. They also have the IMF in their pocket. 
By the way, the banks aren't always responsible. It is mainly the government at fault for creating the Fed monster or at least allowing it to be created.

Centralised banking = socialism.

It won't be long before the NYSE rings the bell over a bitcoin pit.

Money for those people doesn't come from taxes. It comes from the Fed. The Fed controls the taxes and the budget. Taxes just come every April to pay the principal plus the interest.

You realise that the only reason why people "trust" the dollar is because they were indoctrinated as youths to automatically trust it and they have been accustomed to using it, without regard to the fact that the dollar itself is an instrument of tyrannical centralised banking. The biggest thing that gives the dollar value is the fact that the vast majority of people using it have absolutely no idea where it gets created or how the Fed bank operates. 
Even if people did figure out how the central banking scam works, it would be pointless because there is coercive force behind it, therefore the dollar has two different "backings" behind it. If you go against the Fed bank, then big men with guns will come and take you away.

Isn't coercive force just lovely? /s

Assuming that they are not bluffing and that they actually have the power to track identities within private and public keys, it would not be unsafe to assume that they would also carry the ability to hunt down those people. 
Furthermore, second layers like the Lightning Network can easily be raided by federal authorities and international ones. The only safe way to ensure its safety is to move operations to a country without a central bank, like Liechtenstein. Even then, they could still infiltrate. 
We would have to innovate faster than they can. 
Or perhaps, not just innovate, but rebel. We could follow their rules and property taxes and continue to follow them until enough people worldwide are using Bitcoin. Then, we make decentralised wallets and massively boycott the International Monetary Fund, bankrupting it on the same day. It would have to be coordinated in several steps, and we would have to use large amounts of people and display information quickly in a way where it can't just be censored at once.

Except for the fact that many state governments are banning bitcoin and the IRS started cracking down on the blockchain. They are now taxing it like crazy and claim to have the power to detect private key identities with it. 
The Fed is getting scared. :) 
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:29:27
I am almost certain that the development of second layers and financial sector transactions using the blockchain will ultimately crash the dollar and the Fed bank. Then, it'll be worth more than that. Just keep hodling. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:09:18
You can't inflate bitcoin. It has a finite limit of 21,000,000.

HSBC also funds drug cartels as well if I'm not mistaken. 
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:17:32


Yes. 


Yes, what's the problem with this? 


Yes it is. Taxation is *theft*. 


Funny, that's what every totalitarian government has said for centuries. 


But.... but without government, who will.... 
* lynch minorities 
* build the roads 
* manipulate currency 
* charge you for debt that you never borrowed 
* crash the economy on purpose to advocate for more regulation 
* pollute the environment 
* ~~protect~~ violate our rights 
* act like they know more than me about how to run my own life
* go to war? 
Without government regulation of every single aspect of the economy, who will do these things?!?! Oh no! /s 


Of course, because millions of people being slaughtered in the Middle East was a choice that was made on *my* behalf.

It won't be much longer if Lightning Network and Blockstream don't increase the block size like Satoshi wanted..... 
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:18:48
Nah it's everywhere, fuck the government. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:18:25
You can't tax bitcoin.... 
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:19:41
Because the banks don't control the bitcoin. They can't just credit you whatever, and also you don't need a bank to store it. 
The banks would lose all of their power. The only form of centralisation would be derivative exchanges. 
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:45:18


Do you expect these actions to be coordinated in the public interest? Do you seriously *trust* the government? 
All of these services can be provided competitively in private settings.

BIS = the Fed, basically. 
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:27:39


How so? 


There's nothing stopping extra movers. The government exists to stifle competition and create regulatory barriers to market entry. 


You refuse to even say anything about it?
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:16:33
Banks love to have free worthless slips of paper without having to compete for it. You'll be sold into slavery for failure to use the worthless slips of paper and for failure to surrender a portion of them for any price that the government wants. 
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:26:26
Monopolies would be impossible in a truly free market.
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:53:35
Idk but I still remember the original of this repost.

It's not "buying" bitcoin. It's selling fiat.

I would never get involved with the finances, I would only use any new contracts in a new startup. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:26:43
Perhaps when it becomes more available for everyday use I may consider it, but I would print out private keys on receipt paper as their paycheck with their signature and mine on it. 
I would only consider it as a "negotiable instrument", meaning that both parties agree prior to work, I would regularly have photocopies of every signed wage contract. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:25:18
I understand your point. Maybe when Bitcoin Core grows a lot and it is used more as a medium for exchange, like being used for insurance and food and whatnot, then I may consider it. But I definitely would be prepared for any legal trouble because a "negotiable instrument" is negotiated and agreed upon prior to work. And I would only use it for extremely close coworkers. 
I would also not use this in any existing business but I would probably look into it for new startups. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:32:10
I edited my post clarifying this. It would only be if bitcoin were widely accepted for everyday use and I would have a plethora of contracts signed prior to work that agree that bitcoin is a negotiable instrument.
