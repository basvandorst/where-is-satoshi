I used to live a block from here! Didn't accept btc when I shopped there every Saturday morning though!

Our obsessive pining over charts and economic fundamentals will get us laid when we go to pick groups for the high school classes we all most definitely are attending in our most likely 20s and 30s

It's a good ride actually. Ford makes meh cars but the fusion is an industry leader in hybrid and plug in hybrid

Make sure you have all your affairs in order. Don't mean that morbidly, but your life risks are inherently higher because of it. Having a way to pass on your keys is tricky, but too many coins have been locked up or lost due to one reason or another. 
Always headcam your rides. Buddy of mine got rear ended at a light on his bike and due to the video footage he received damages that covered repairs and since he was luckly uninjured I think it covered a fair amount of sats.
Stay safe out there fellow traveler!

There are arguments to be made that state we are in a heavy accumulation phase before possibly going down farther and then up in a prolonged fashion. 
That explains the high tx numbers, and the way they are staying more stable for the moment is due to an increase in hashing power whilst segwit  is live in many channels and the Lightning Newtowk continues to grow. 
Not claiming to be an expert, these are all just verifiable elements that I believe are contributing to the current state of things. 
IMO Bitfinex/Tether still looms in the background as markets don't seem to be responding to it very strongly. Some call it a FUD campaign against Bitfinex, but I personally believe we can expect to see a multi level reaction to this discovery of their $850 million seizure (we went down right after the release but the price is being kept up too heavily compared to sentiment in the community).

Love how people would rather shit on your for using the onramp that is most accessible to you currently rather than provide actual information on alternatives.
To answer your original question though, you can do a bank transfer onto coinbase and then move the money over to CBPro. Takes a number of days for the money to move, but it incurs the least number of fees whilst using that methodology. I personally don't know any other way that reduces the fees more.

Then you probably think all of the countries with major adoption happening currently are "shitholes" aka every developing country that can't rely on their government. You're literally shitting on the number one use case of Bitcoin: Freeing the unbanked and oppressed. Glad to have you involved...

That is good, we are both plugged into the same pop culture neural network. The correct one I should say ;)

The best TA has nothing to do with price predictions, and instead shows short term trends and the general shape of the volume involved in said short term movements
