rbtc is a censored shitstain cesspit of trolls like yourself

Trip+full time job or retirement. Your choice.

It only takes brass balls if you have a brass brain. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:27:57
The fact that ETH forked to bail out dao inverstors makes it a mutable shitcoin scam.
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:04:20
Can feel the next ltc bubble about to get started.
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:50:57
Mutable shitchains are worthless pal.
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:11:18
At that point, may as well buy it all now. If you're just going to wait out a gamble of whether it goes up or down just buy the average. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:25:29
Fake. CGI.

Kids should be told Santa isn't real....they should also be told astronauts and space aren't real. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:22:35
Make sure to do an enema during.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:25:42
FUD. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:34:06
I justify it because it will be worth 100x in a few years haha.
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:34:00
Useless as they ever were. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:32:57


Stopped right there.
Huge fucking mistake.
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:28:53
On the other hand, if no one is analyzing the user statistics properly, they might just assume the ads are working well and keep them running even longer than they would have.  
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:25:11
No. Opposite. Altcoins will die. Except litecoin. Litecoin looks like it will be used alongside bitcoin to help with scalability. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:57:34
Stop promoting the false spinning ball earth model. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:24:02


The price rose 5x in value........
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:44:48
Look into it. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:31:14
Don't talk to 99.9% of teachers about anything related to real life. They will just point you back to their flawed curriculum. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:29:55
^ lies
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:55:21
Fake cgi pic.
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:51:23
Take anything this guy ever says says with a huge grain of salt. He has and will say anything to keep the scaling war alive and kicking. This tweet for example. His shitcoin business depends on it.

@_date: 2017-02-17 05:45:30
Obvious troll is obvious.
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:14:58
KeeyKey has the passphrase feature.
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:56:43
KeepKey is most appealing to me.
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:56:16
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:12:18
Yes, try to get yourself half a bitcoin and then just hodl onto it for a decade (and always be getting more when you can).
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:52:12
Yes. Don't sell at 2k though. Spend it at 100k.
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:41:38
Professors are usually idiots. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 22:17:36
A rbtc user on board with needless hardfork? Shocking.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:15:17
Gemini is the one exchange I would feel *okay* leaving *some* coin on for trading. Only a small portion though, and still only an amount I would be able to get over losing. If you have more than that you need to look into alternative storage. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:37:11
Keep it that way. Stay shitcoin free. Btc and ltc only please. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:45:11
Also btc-e
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:31:08
You tried. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 05:23:15
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:58:07
Going to work for LTCC
@_date: 2017-01-23 01:46:58
She's a feeder. Only interested in your resources. She doesn't care about you. Go read "The Manipulated Man".
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:27:27
This comment is irrelevent to the topic.
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:56:43
Already is with Counterparty XCP
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:13:41
Dudes nothing but a blatant greasy ass troll.
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:24:47
Leaving to pump shitcoins I take it?
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:14:56
This sub should be seen as a little more serious than that.
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:38:48


Get your bitcoin earnings. Bang. Money. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 06:26:30


Highly disagreed.
In on troll thread. Classic 80/20 bait and switch tactics employed here. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:32:54
It's called hodling long term. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:41:54
There's way to many call to action/policing/wannabe hero posts here. Be the post you want to see and not some kind of keyboard revolutionist.
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:38:46
This guy gets it. Avoid bitdiggers. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:45:02
Still irrelevent you cuck.

Also litecoin segwit activation.
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:27:26
Because they want to. Crypto is about freedom of choice.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:09:52
Dash = scam 
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:26:49
Divorce her and be free. Dont be a cuck.

Report to Reddit admins.
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:17:45
Do people even realize the web bots predicted this a week before it happened?
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:31:23
Nice argument /s. OP never mentioned anything about trading. Your post speaks on the irrelevency itself.
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:09:12
I only see one guy who's in here calling people trolls. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 01:33:03
Dump her. Quickly. Get her out of your life.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:51:02
Wow. You're still wrong you low iq troll shill. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 07:03:01
It still will.
