This is a circular argument. You’re saying it’s easy to make a good UI, because all you need is a good designer. In reality it’s exceedingly hard for someone who is not a user to predict what might feel intuitive to as large an audience as possible. Even if they are a top UI designer. There is an element of trial and error plus luck.

Probably the instant ACH they offer which locks in your fiat price point. This can sometimes cost you more than the fee difference. Coinbase pro ACH still takes 3-5 days. I agree with using pro for both directions though, but it only makes sense if you’re not in a rush.

One thing that might happen if there is a correction is that people unwilling to realize a material loss in their primary currency might just leave their wallets alone and chalk it up to a loss. They might even learn how to spend their Bitcoins for goods and services, which if there's a correction means transaction fees will hopefully be lower. A correction might lead to forced adoption.

Not to mention this is specifically a course on emerging payment technology. People don’t transact cars for payments generally.

I know we all want to know if we’re in the green/red, and a certain amount of awareness is healthy, but for me not having to obsess over details like this and whether I was in the overall +/- is a big perk of DCA.

The appeal isn’t this false ideal that one can hide every illicit transaction from the government, but that it makes mass non-targeted surveillance much more difficult and that bitcoin is naturally censorship resistant. So it’s not that the crowd fixated on the importance of those properties are or should be the primary supporters, but they are mutually aligned allies.

Very cool. One nitpick you could probably get away with ignoring is the language “stored on computers across the internet”. People might get the idea that each computer stores only a small part of the block chain. Instead you could say “database replicated and synced across many computers on the internet”.

Ahh yea. I see that now. Great stuff again.

He’s been a tech investor for awhile and always tries to find interesting trends and companies. It’s true there are a lot of tech investors interested in crypto right now, but Alexis only goes all in for companies and tech where he really likes the people involved in it, even if he himself isn’t an expert authority in the domain. If he’s bullish on BTC it means he’s studied the people and teams behind it and likes what he sees. Also his business partner and friend Garry Tan is a huge crypto enthusiast outside of just Bitcoin. He follows all the major cryptos religiously. If Alexis is saying good things about BTC on behalf of Initialized Capital, it probably means they both like it.
