That's what we are discussing here though. You have the rules to protect your good faith acceptance of funds, but coloring coins could lead to the eroding of these protections. And sadly, there are many people arguing for just such a thing. This is the danger of coloring coins and treating them differently.

No, just someone who isn't as myopic and illogical as yourself. Big picture is that destroying fungibility, for any reason, will destroy the currency. The road to hell is paved in good intentions. We can already trace BTC, but acting upon that and marking certain coins will cause a level of doubt that people will no longer accept them for fear of not being able to spend them.
This will ultimately kill BTC if sidechains don't fix this issue. Coins that focus on decentralized masking will survive, because privacy != criminality, no matter how much idiots trumpet this moronic logic. Privacy, in this case, ensures that a coin you receive will give you the confidence that it can be spent.

The only coin that will survive is the one that guarantees fungibility. 1 Coin = 1 Coin. In the end, the only way this can be guaranteed is by privacy and concealing where coins come from.

The community keeps trusting people with their coins. A fool and his money... BTC is supposed to be trustless. If you want to risk your money by trusting third parties, why not just use cash and Visa? Since we don't quite have decentralized exchanges yet, people should in no way keep money on an exchange. Day trading is a risk. When are people going to learn? If you don't have your coin personally, YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR COIN.
The worst response to this thievery is to promote coin marking and policies that enforce it. Wanna tank the economy? Tell me that there's a good chance that any coin someone sends me for a good or service may be blacklisted and it would be difficult for me to know. Then I'll stop accepting BTC period. Guess what happens to BTC when enough people are too afraid to accept it? 
The answer. No coin marking. Don't trust your coins to anyone without knowing you take a great risk. We have a trustless protocol that should be using trustless services to facilitate the economy...not third parties whom we need to trust.

It will kill BTC. Better start looking for 100% anonymous alternatives. DRK is working for that as are a few others. In the end, I believe the coin that delivers this will succeed BTC.

Then word of this will cause the complete lack of trust of said exchange and no one will use them. Why would you send your funds there if there was a chance this could occur?
@_date: 2014-10-20 21:50:08
That would kill a business. If I thought for 1 single second that an exchange would flag my deposit as fraudulent unbeknownst to me, I would never send them a satoshi ever again. Who would ever risk sending them money to be exchanged if the threat was there that they would confiscate it?

Tumblers are an imperfect method to restore fungibility to BTC. Fungibility is a feature of a currency. If BTC is not fungible, then it is not a currency by definition. It's just some other less useful means of exchange.
BTC is not issued by the Fed or the Treasury. BTC is extra-national. There will come a time soon when grey-haired fuddy duddies realize that the world has changed and they can no longer expect to wield the same kind of arbitrary power that they once held over others. Cryptography and cryptocurrencies will make the leap and will win the arms race. It is better for the governments to realize this now and try to become a useful and cooperative part rather than be left behind and risk lashing out like a pathetic jealous and spurned boyfriend.

If their spending their stolen coin means that people do not have to fear confiscation of their own wealth by "legal" thieves, then it's a price worth paying.

If a currency's units are not fungible, then the currency is not functional. Anyone who is calling for this to be an acceptable response is either working against BTC or just too stupid to realize how this will make it worthless as a medium of exchange. I only accept dollars because I'm certain that someone will in turn accept them from me. If no one accepted them, I wouldn't either.

And this is why BTC will die and another coin that works for anonymity will succeed it. No one will accept BTC if your logic is carried out. So, the only solution is a coin that 100% obfuscates the origin of the coins in a decentralized manner.

This is exactly what we do not want. Anyone who argues otherwise is an enemy of BTC and working against it. We do not want thieves and we certainly do not condone this kind of behavior, but why the hell do people trust third parties with their coin when BTC is supposed to be trustless from the start? This short-sighted means of dealing with fraud is how you kill BTC. 
If anything, it's probably just people whose interest is to kill BTC working on the fears of people to implement the kind of policies that will eventually kill BTC. They sow seeds of doubt.

The only coin that will survive is the one that guarantees fungibility. BTC will not survive in its current state.

Doesn't mean he can't dollar cost average to hedge that he may be wrong but still wants to buy into it more. I'm not saying it will go one way or another, but trying to catch a falling knife is likely to get you cut more often than not.

Anyone who holds BTC because this is a fantastic way to fuck the currency altogether.
