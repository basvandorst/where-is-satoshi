I just think they should have put the qualifier "allegedly" before "bitcoin founder" without any hard proof. Seems pretty irresponsible, especially if they are wrong. If they're right then, it's a different story. The point is, there is no way that they're 100% sure they're right because if they had hard proof, they would have put it in the first paragraph. If they're wrong on the other hand, I think they set themselves up for a pretty spectacular backlash.
I'm not a sub to this forum btw. I just searched for this thread for the bitcoin enthusiast POV after reading the news earlier.

Yeah, that's all I'm saying. I just don't know how a magazine as large as they are can get away with posting stories based off of hunches, no matter how strong they may be. They didn't even say "allegedly" they just flat out said he's the guy.

Actually, he said:


and when asked about it by USA Today he said he was talking about his engineering career, not being the founder of BitCoin. She took that to mean what she wanted it to mean, IMO, and ran with it. In the mean time though, it doesn't really matter until it's either proved that it's him or that it isn't. If he isn't they guy, she's going to have some explaining to do, along with Newsweek. I'm leaning towards he seems unlikely to be the guy because he really isn't.

The son also said that he didn't know if he was behind it or not. He didn't say he would deny it even though he was the guy. He said he'd deny it regardless of if he were the guy or not.

Are YOU serious? How do you know Newsweek got it right and he IS they guy? He shares a supposed name and a supposed nationality with the supposed "real" guy. That's a lot of supposed. They even said theirselves that they found more than a few people with the same name/nationality. They're basing all of this off of assumption. So the guy has a physics degree and has done defense work. What does that prove? It's a coincidence, and a slight one at that.
I think it's pretty irresponsible for them to point the finger and say "this is the guy" with out any kind of hard proof what so ever. And even if he is the guy, if he wants to stay anonymous, they should respect that and leave the guy alone.

Oh yeah, it's far from proof. I'm just saying, that's something my grandmother would say to talk about something she knew absolutely nothing about. "You're smoking the pot aren't you".  You know?

What sold me was, he called it "THE bitcoin". That's something someone totally unsavvy would say.

Not only that but, look at how she even got in touch with the man in the first place. She conned some model train company into giving her his personal information and then held conversations with the man pretending to be interested in his hobby. If that isn't unethical and maybe even illegal, it's at least greasy as hell.

That's basically exactly why. It's he said she said. There is no hard proof and that's what journalism supposedly is: presenting the public with the facts, not the maybes. Put it this way, what if she wrote a story about you that said "ModernDemagogue is the man responsible for a string of murders that happened in 1999" just because of a hunch? 
There is a reason stuff like this doesn't happen. Journalists usually follow a certain protocol for things like this. Like when someone gets arrested for murder, they still attach the "allegedly" tag on them until they're convicted.
