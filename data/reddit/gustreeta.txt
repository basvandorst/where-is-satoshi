This sub upvotes fake news and downvotes logical assumptions
@_date: 2018-09-08 09:33:24
Theres no need to explain and worsen the joke
@_date: 2018-09-23 11:34:20
May and Farage are cancer.
But the point was that she didnt say anything remotely close to that.
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:54:06
I mean, its completely fake news
The next Bitcoin supporter will be Pope Francis at this rate
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:27:02
THERESA MAY ON BITCOIN
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:53:19
So let me get this straight.
A shill posts a fake statement from theresa may.
You can watch recent interviews in which theresa may has a very negative stance on bitcoin.
You can choose to believe the shills post but save your bullshit msm manipulation for someone else.
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:03:07
Thats not the point lol
The woman in the picture IS theresa may btw
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:36:09
Starting bid, but whos gonna buy it ?
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:29:41

@_date: 2018-09-18 12:22:16
Yeah the trend is really pointing in that direction
@_date: 2018-09-27 13:57:57
Propaganda really hit your head hard
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:03:45
Sure man if that makes you feel better
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:50:31
Its strange because if you google Theresa May Bitcoin the only results are "Theresa May very seriously considering taking action against digital currencies"
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:52:18
Except its not since she declared she wants to take action AGAINST digital currencies
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:41:42
How can so many people in this thread be so retarded to miss that thats not the point.
The point is she never said anything like that in the picture, but she actually said the opposite you fucking functional analphabets.
@_date: 2018-09-27 13:56:38
Hurr durr Im not interested in knowing where I am wrong
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:29:33
No they are not.
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:06:34
Are you unable to hear what he says ?
@_date: 2018-09-23 11:28:49
Which would mean this "statement from UK leader" is Fake as fuck
Also no, it would mean less people buying it.

Why every two post on reddit I see an idiot talking about the Dunning Kruger effect. Ffs.
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:55:39
This sub made me rethink my opinion on buying bitcoins.
Its basically a sept convinced that repeating the mantra of "hodl" will gain them some money.
It takes advantages on more people buying the product.
Every time they post a "bullish" news from someone twitter, its from some shady guy previously involved in even shadier business.
All in all, this seems very close to the old "ways to get rich quick".
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:30:10
Calm down
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:46:30
Are you allowed to handle real money ?

I love how you throw the word logic around because youre one of petersons cattle
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:36:56
Thats so retarded. Do you think any 40 years old man would say "Im against bitcoin because its against the natural order of things" ?
What natural order ? 
Is this guy a writer as a hobby or is it his real work ?
@_date: 2018-11-09 13:44:55
Hes 16 years old, hes not allowed to have one yet
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:28:09
Why would she use the term hatching if she knows that "sitting on " has a figurative meaning? 
Does she uses eggs analogies for money in banks too?
Or does she thinks you actually are sitting on phisical coins?
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:12:57

Hmmm .. Yeah ? Who else lol ?
Anyway you were talking about it kinda like you knew about it 
As it appears you didnt knew shit about it and still wanted to share your worthless and biased opinion 
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:42:14

@_date: 2018-04-10 09:21:17
People here have interest in other people buying bitcoins, that makes this sub is 100 % biased and dishonest in this regard.
