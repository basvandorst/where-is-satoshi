Besides this store, I read that there is a hair saloon in Split accepting bitcoin (there is also a BTM in Split). There are a few places in Croatia which accept bitcoin, but I think most of them are in Zagreb.

Probabilistc payments are an interesting idea that has existed for some time, eg [1]. Mike Caldwell suggested them for Bitcoin [2]. There are several paper like [3] suggesting probabilistic payments for crypto-currencies.
I think this proposed scheme could work, but the authors weren't clear enough on two things. First when Alice sends her two transactions to Bob, I think both must not only contain len(X), but also a commitment to X. Otherwise Bob could just input any 20 or 21 bit number. Second, both transactions should contain commitments to Y1 and Y2.

Definitively an interesting time to have a BTM in Greece.

I just might be crazy enough to try it :)

Good luck Switzerland. I'll donate something too.

This is a cool article. It's interesting to see how bitcoin is used in places other than US/EU.

Sh*t, I live in one of those countries.

Sure, I have two of those. I will use one to launch my minisub from

Been there, done that :) It's nice to know that they are still accepting bitcoin. I was afraid that after the conference there won't be anyone to pay with btc. Except Blue_bit_AUT ;)

Čak bi me više zanimalo da ima netko sa softverske strane zainteresiran, ali dobro :) Svaka čast na trudu. Pratit ću ovaj podcast.

I used this at CEBE in Vienna. It was my first time using a BTM and I liked it.

Thank you for the cool writeup ;)

Hi! It's great that you started a podcast. Looking forward to hearing it. CRO: Tko su veterani kriptovaluta kod nas? Vidim da na bitcointalku ima rudara i na forum.hr da ima investitora i rudara. Misli li se na njih?
@_date: 2014-06-26 11:06:34
Saw this at CEBE and was waiting for this campaign. I prefer Indiegogo over KIckstarter.

Are there that many bitcoin users in Romania?
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:35:04
Hi, we had a beer there last night and met you (folks from Cro). It was a pleasure to meet you and we really like what you are doing with promoting bitcoin in this way. Keep it up!

Bitcoin paintings, great idea! I'd like to visit the exhibition in Zagreb. Vidimo se.

Thank you for inforimg us. I see I can buy a 258-acre mountain top in Mexico :D

This is great. Go Bratislava :)

I really recomend this course. It helped me with understanding the crypto involved in Satoshi's paper. Dan Boneh knows a lot about crypto and can explain it well. You will get a general overview of some basic ciphers and attacks and you will also get the details.
I've been waiting for Cryptography II to start for two years :(

I think I'll buy me a mini-sub   Always wanted one of those

If I go to Split this year, I'm going to try and find it.
@_date: 2016-06-03 07:07:45
Probably a small party in Zagreb.

From what little I can gather, it seems that this result poses no threat to ECC. At least so far. Maybe it could point to future research that could weaken ECC, but as Fefe's blog says, there have been similar results in the past with no impact on ECC.

Did he miss the year in his title slide? It says 25.01.2017 but later he says that MuSig has been recently released (it was released this year) and mentions Taproot which is also from this year.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:39:52
Do I understand correctly that MuSig is a multisignature scheme and an interactive aggragated signature scheme at the same time?

Where did Bitcoin lose that 0.01%?

But that ATM in Agram has been there for almost a year. This news piece seems confused. Anyone have more info?

Thank you, but Jonas was before Giulia.

It says "Bitcoin exchange". I know Bitkonan exchange wanted to open a physical exchange in Split. It seems like they opened one in Zagreb too.

Man, they have two BTM's and we have only one :(

When big companies, banks or governments talk about virtual currencies they almost always mean "private blockchain".

Also something like this

I extracted the link, but I just wanted to point it out, even if it's only a detail :)
