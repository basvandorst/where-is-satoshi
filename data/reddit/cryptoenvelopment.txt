Not a Bcash supporter but I think its absurd to say it was a malicious fork. Forks are not malicious or benevolent. They are just forks which are a feature of the Bitcoin network. If Roger sees block size as the solution to scaling, more power to him for trying to make that work! I can't imagine anything over taking BTC but I do see value in different chains/projects experimenting with different strategies. BTC can learn from the failures/successes of others.

When you say "most accurately" I think you mean to say "least accurately."

Right it doesn't need one but it sure would be nice if the .com domain was controlled by a BTC supporter. Confusing new crypto people is pretty problematic in my opinion.

While I agree with most of what you're saying, hasn't the entire market always moved with Bitcoin?

Because of the order book. Check it out and I promise it will make more sense to you. Every buy and sell order is not at the same price.

This is what adoption looks like.

"Overall, early adopters, market participants and investors willing to weather the storm were highly rewarded." Sorry that's not correct. They were not "highly rewarded" during the .com bust. Most people lost lots of money and some lost everything they had.

Are you a wookus bitcoinius? Didn't know they existed!
