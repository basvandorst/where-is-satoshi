"Will I earn money by mining" wasnt my question was it?

I read it, there is nothing answering that question. Just dont post "questions about mining" and go somewhere else....
Too many rules, makes for a snobby community. Point in case....
I'll go to the bitcoin mining sub-sub-subreddit and ask my question there.

Oh... Im sorry, I thought would be the perfect place to ask such a question, seems logical enough. I didnt realize this was such an  elite group.

It would have been much easier to say "Hey, check out the link that reads will i earn money by mining" in the sticky, you'll find some good info there." 
If you said that in the first place, you wouldnt have come off as such an eliteist dick. If I spent time following every single vaguely descriptive link, I wouldnt have time for anything else, which is why I ask questions. There are no stupid questions, just stupid answers.
I will follow the link and read it...

I'm guessing that you intended me to see which rule i broke. More specefically the rule It seems that prompted you to ask me to read the sticky. Something about asking about mining? Possibly?
