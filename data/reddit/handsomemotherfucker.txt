I know it sounds strange but after being involved in bitcoin since 2011 I am still shocked when I talk to people and they are aware of bitcoin.. or when it is shown in popular media. Even though the media coverage of Mt. Gox's current situation has been negative, it shows me something which I theoretically knew but never had a visual representation of; and that is that the overall reach of bitcoin has clearly surpassed what I ever imagined was possible this early in it's development. If not for bitcoin solely but the idea of cryptocurrencies in general has had a pervasive impact on society and may be be mainstreamed something in the near future. I don't know but this seems like an iconic moment for me, thanks for sharing this

It doesn't even have the right year on them..

As Mt.Gox owes the bitcoins to the creditors isn't it therefore a liability and not an asset for the company.

If you sell at £30,000 like you said, you should predominately be within the [tax free allowance bracket]( You would only need to report this when you sell the coins (which could be after a few years) but make sure that you report the gains through a self-assessment tax form. 
I would suggest contacting the HMRC directly though if you are unsure of any of this as they offer free tax advice.

Yea and if/when you're ready to sell, move them back to an exchange that converts to GBP and transfer that back to your bank account. 
Remember that you'll need to report any profit that you make as capital gains to the government or else it'll be seen as suspicious... the exchange that you used will keep a record of the price you bought and sold the coins for.

he only sold this amount so that all claimants receive the full amount of their claims (just in case the price tanked)… The rest will mostly likely be left alone until a decision can be made about civil rehabilitation.

which would make it more volatile based upon OPs logic.

If I remember correctly, each bitcoin was set by the Japanese court to be valued at $400 - which is why it is so low comparatively. 
How the rest will be distributed is now up for debate however I highly doubt that it would actually go to Mark Karpeles. It seems like they are talking about [civil rehabilitation in the latest report]( This means that the bankrupcy might be called off and the remaining bitcoins will be split equally amongst the creditors.

[Extra Credits History gives a great overview of the origins of money if you are interested.] ( 
I would also suggest their videos on the South Sea bubble if you have time.

Their series on the [South Sea Bubble]( is incredible to watch as well; lots of financial manipulation!

I cancelled one last week as well which I tried to withdrawal back in June. So frustrating, trying to make a SEPA withdrawal now..

GBP doesn't work either

The price right now on MtGox is an illusion. People can't even withdraw their btc or dollars out of MtGox now

England, sorry just realised what I wrote
