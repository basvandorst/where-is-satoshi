**Bitcoin to credit card: 247exchange.com makes it easy to convert bitcoin to fiat money**
Our exchange service [247exchange]( added support of credit and debit cards as a convenient withdrawal method. That makes shopping with Bitcoin much easier.
This exclusive feature is really universal. It’s connected to both **Visa** and **MasterCard** providers. Cards of different types, including the prepaid ones, supported. The user can also choose the currency.
*“It’s always been a headache for everyone to exchange his bitcoins to fiat money with minimal losses. If you look at the market, you’ll see that only few companies offer such service as withdrawing cryptocurrencies to cards. Maybe we’re not the pioneers, but we’re among the first ones. With our service Bitcoin becomes one step closer to real money. It’s never been so easy to transform bitcoin into usd, euro or another fiat currency”*, Alexey Maximenko, CEO of InterMoney Exchange, says.
In fact, the innovation of 247exchange allows not only to convert bitcoin to fiat money easily, but also to pay the bills (including utility ones) with bitcoins. Other useful options are that you can pay for your loans with bitcoins and transfer money to friends and relatives. All you need for this - just sell your bitcoins and get money to your credit card.
All goods and services that could be purchased only with USD, EUR, etc can now be bought with cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Namecoin). The bitcoin user can now make online and offline purchases with his favourite card in different parts of the world even if he doesn’t have a bank account. And also he can **receive cash in over 3 million ATMs around the globe**. It’s extremely actual for developing countries and regions.
Moreover, for small and medium amounts the fees will be less than in case of using bank wire transfer as a withdrawal instrument. This feature will be convenient for miners, traders, freelancers and everyone else who regularly withdraws such amounts of Bitcoin (for example, his profit) for his current needs and expenses.
To withdraw bitcoins or another cryptocurrency to credit/debit card, please submit [a sell order]( initiating verification process. Our 24/7 support is always eager to assist the customer in live chat or by phone.
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:04:36
It's not excessive at all. You can compare our fees with the similar services' ones (though there are not many exchanges which do btc to credit card). Also, sometimes there are promos at our website giving discounts to our customers.

But have you managed to find info about PCI certification of any other services on PCI website? We guess, not, because there is no such list.
To be honest, it's the first time the customer asks us about PCI certification details. Well, we just gave you a link to the screenshot in your ticket (if it's yours, of course). There is all we can show as a proof, the rest details can't be shared by security reasons.

Thanks for interest to our company, but we should ask you not to name our PCI DSS certification as "fake". We completed PCI DSS certification even before getting merchant account and we're regularly rechecked.
Generally it's VISA and MasterCard requirement for the service accepting credit cards to complete PCI DSS certification. There are thousands of certified websites. So, I really can't understand your doubts.


And it's showing on our site actually - there is an icon. We can't give you the full report, becuase it contains some technical details about our servers and some private info which we can't share, and none of other services share that, we believe. There is no list of pci compliant websites in the web. There are different providers who make such audit.
