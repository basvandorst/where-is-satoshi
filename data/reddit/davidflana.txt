His ID is not verified yet so it won't let him buy.

oh yes, I see now.  I was reading below and thought mhall812 was the same OP.  Looks like we have 2 guys with 2 different issues.

I just bought a bunch the other day on coinbase. They lock the price at the time you lock in the purchase. So once the bank transfer completes, the coin ends up in your wallet no matter what the current price is. They even emailed a receipt indicating how many coins I bought and what the price was. So, it may takes days for the transfer but your buy is locked in at that time. I am confused about the disconnect here...  did you verify your bank account and identity with them?

It sounds like he didn't issue a purchase. He transferred money from his bank to his USD wallet and was going to buy when it got there...  I guess that's a lesson learned. You can buy and transfer in one move

It took a week for me to finally be able to upload my ID. once it finally took it was about 24 hours before my identity was verified that was last week. you just have to be patient and keep trying

and what are you going to buy once it lands? (and a hush comes over the crowd... hehe)  I just bought a bunch of litecoin on Sunday.  I was FINALLY ID verified on saturday.  I saw it below 300 on saturday.  When I was verified I though "Oh, I will just wait for it to dip back down to 275 or so and then grab it.......  OMG that was torture!  It started creeping up and up.  When it hit 320 I was like CRAP!!!!  I better get on before I miss the boat completely!  Heck with this finding a seat up front, I'll take coach!  So I bought at 327.  And then it went down!!  LMAO!!  It stayed down on Sunday and I tried my best not to constantly check it...  so maybe 10 times an hour instead of 15!  Thankfully it got some traction yesterday and now I am happy as it was up in the 350-360 area all day and hopefully it keep climbing.  I like Litecoin because it seems to be more like the currency that actually has a chance to be used for day to day transactions.  Its the speed and the close link to Bitcoin.  I have seen a lot of smart people saying Bitcoin is the new Gold and Litecoin will be what you convert to when you want to make a quick purchase.  I also read that Litecoin has been the test bed for upgrades to bitcoin.  So if Litecoin does it first, and bitcoin follows, it just seems like a safe bet that people will eventually see them like gold backing the dollar and they will be proven to work seamlessly together.  And as such should have similar value.
