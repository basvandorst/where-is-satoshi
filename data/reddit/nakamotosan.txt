Thanks!  Looks nice.  Well done with the site.

I can guarantee because I have common sense. I'd love to hear your explanation as to why Circle would have to send small deposits in order to trace your spending, even though they can trace the Bitcoin that you purchase from them.  I have received over fifty of these small deposits from random people, and 100% of them have been spam, with a message (advertisement) tied to them that are viewable at blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:36:58
I've heard stories of coinbase accounts being closed even after doing what you explained. To be totally safe you need to use a mixer. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 02:40:49
I second that. Xapo blows. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:40:51
For $1,000 tho...
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:53:29
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed.  Read the rules. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:38:46
Those .0001 deposits are spam. Try looking at those interactions at blockchain.info. You'll probably see spam messages tied to them. Has nothing to do with Circle, I guarantee. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:15:40
I have used both a lot and I prefer the user interface of Circle. The buy price is usually lower too. 
I've heard of way too many people getting their Coinbase accounts closed for stupid reasons, so that's another reason I use Circle more.

I would recommend adding links to useful resources to help people get started.  Like this:
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:41:58
You know how to make a faucet, but you don't know how to obtain Bitcoin?  Huh?
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:13:41
I picked a random shitcoin, and the chart data was empty when I clicked on 1m, 3m, 6m, etc.  Only works when I click "all".
It doesn't work, so I'm not going to use it.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:10:17
Doesn't work...

What are you so afraid of?
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:36:21
No they are not counted. Changetips take place off the blockchain. So do Coinbase to Coinbase transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:43:56
Can *anyone* give a real-life use case for this?  Aside from celebrities, which is like 0.00001% of the population?
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:44:12
Tell the buyer you lost the btc.  Nobody can force you to send something you no longer have.
And delete this reddit post.  There's a damn good chance the buyer is going to see this.

I agree that it is immature for people to dog on doge, calling it stupid or a scam.  
But at the same time, I think it is highly irresponsible to recommend doge to anyone, simply because it is an incredibly poor and risky investment.  Of course, Bitcoin is risky, but Doge is 100x riskier.  Doge has zero chance against Bitcoin's network effect, and really does not have anything different to offer than it's cute mascot (and yes, I'm well aware of scrypt).  Encouraging others to use doge will probably do more harm than good in the long run.  
So I don't think we are on the same team.  I really mean no offense to you.  This is just what I believe.  
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:32:02
Exactly.  High price does not mean less manipulation.  It has more to do with volume than the price of a single coin.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:13:54
Free speech motha fucka.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:40:36
I get that.  Can you give a real-life use case for this?
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:47:28
Back when Coinbase still had a $5 referral bonus my friends ate that shit up.  Now they want to kick my ass because they all lost money.

Tell your gf I like her nipples.

I believe cheaper energy would lead to more miners, which leads to higher hash power, which leads to higher difficulty, which leads to a more secure network.
Miners will always be in it for the money.  It will still cost them money to keep up with the ever increasing difficulty.
After all, its the money-making incentive that keeps the network secure.

If I don't own my bitcoin, then how did I just buy something from tigerdirect?
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:41:10
So you're saying it's primarily intended for spammers?
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:32:14
I have a solution.  Always create a backup. (Well duh!)
Can I have my 1 BTC now?

Show them this chart.
@_date: 2015-03-07 06:10:11
I personally think that doge is on its way from $0.0000142 to $0.0000001 within a year or two.  Why?  Because of Bitcoin.  This isn't about Bitcoin vs Doge.  I'm saying that Bitcoin is going to cause Doge to lose even more value.  I think it's morally wrong to encourage people to buy Doge.
@_date: 2015-03-07 06:39:17
I see bitcoiners as the engineers working at Bell Laboratories, and dogecoiners as the guys flipping signs on the street corner with huge smiles on their faces.  
Bitcoiners, myself included, are busy developing apps and breakthrough blockchain technologies.  What are dogecoiners doing these days?
Well shit, I guess you're right about us being assholes.  :)
@_date: 2015-03-07 06:25:18
Let's use the internet as an example, because people often compare Bitcoin to the early days of the internet.  People started using it rapidly on a global scale.  Imagine a group of people in the early 90's who start advocating the use of a new protocol in place of HTTP... let's call it DOGETTP, which has a cute mascot.  They go around encouraging people to invest money towards the development of this protocol.  
I feel like you're part of that doomed group of people who is going to end up pissing off a lot of investors.  I still don't see why we should be working together.
@_date: 2015-03-05 04:01:46
I have spent a considerable amount of time studying the different altcoins. Even traded a few of them and made a little money.  My final conclusion is that they are all shit.  There is no chance of any of them overcoming Bitcoin's network effect.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:31:29
Well I guess people should only use Coinbase to buy/sell bitcoin.  Not to be used as a wallet to receive and send coins for day-to-day transactions.

I thought this was a good idea at first, but they probably don't want a bunch of bitcoin fanboys knocking on every door being obnoxious.  That would make BitPay look bad.  Cold calling is a skill that not everyone has.
@_date: 2015-03-05 04:32:16
Dollar value has nothing to do with it pal.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:39:11
Yes it is pal.  To say that you are not allowed to speak negatively about bitcoin is archaic.

Try this calculator.  
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:21:28
I think you answered it correctly. The problem is that the real answer is too complex for average joes.  
I spent an hour trying to explain it to my wife.  She still doesn't get it.
I tell people "it's complicated."

This sounds cool at first, but seriously guys, who is going to pay to send an email?  Would YOU pay to send an email?  I can't think of a single instance in which I would.
