Wasn't an accusation, I was genuinely curious. I've never been called for jury duty, and had no idea what the protocol is. Just seemed logical that soial media might be prohibited. The jury nullification comment was a joke, albeit a lame one.

None yet...tried but not accepted. New to the whole crypto-world and still getting the hang of things, but I intend to pass on 100%. Seems like tips are a nice little gesture that creates new users (that's what convinced me to try it) and shows appreciation toward some established ones. I don't need the little bit of money and would feel guilty profiting from comments.

You could be tainted by information like [jury nullification]( and spoil their intended outcome!

Love it! Only wish they supported a few other currencies.

Is it ok to browse reddit while you're in the jury box? I've never been picked, but I would have assumed that social media access would be frowned upon during a trial.

I gave up trying to make a circle account too. Can't log in with info I set it up with, and their reset password never sends me an email.

Not the first time I've assumed incorrectly. : )
