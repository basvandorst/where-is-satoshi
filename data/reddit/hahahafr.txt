Since the energy they use comes from coal mined in the ground, it's not very far from the truth.

There's a 0.5% fees actually. It goes to the block finder.

Congratulations, along your friends investors you just lost 750 BTC.

Once the 3 addresses are generated, someone has to send the coins first. If someone wants to fuck the system over, he simply let the other party send the coins first and then leave. The 5% are forever lost.

Do people realize that GHash.io is ripping off its users by forcing them to use an address at cex.io, where you have to pay enormous fees to withdraw your coins?
The 3% fees on BTC Guild is also a rip off, but people still go there, I don't understand.
I'm mining at Bitminter with their 1% fees, because I don't trust the admin of Eligius.

In the upcoming version of bitcoin-qt there will be a field "return-to" when sending a tx, if I'm not mistaken.

Through coinbase? More anonymous? WTF?
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:54:48
So these 0.0035 BTC are stuck in limbo forever? How would someone get these coins back?

How is this possible to have 14,756,914**.8023** bitcoins?? Isn't every bitcoin ever created coming from 50.00000000 and 25.00000000 blocks?? (the tx fees come from these base-blocks too) WTF .

No, that's 0.071875% of all mined BTC per day.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:33:13
no, it confuses people, keeping BTC is better.

How to wash money? Bitcoin ATM?

Don't use Paypal for god's sake. Use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:20:51
Yes. This post smells like he's trying to make everything possible to artificially hold the price high.
**tl;dr** post is bullcrap.
