I as much as the next man have used the silk road and bitcoins to get lsd sent to my friends mailbox. 
But Backed crypto currency is making its play. And you are going to get fucked if you buy bit coin. They are going to cash out on you when better services are provided and your money will be gone. 
They have peaked. And the value of crypto is its ability to securely send information “the banks are the ones who benefit most from crypto and that is where the market will be. But coin has no place in that market unless they change policy.

I changed the comment, thought.exe needs to stop auto pressing the post button. I changed the comment and my apologize I did not see your response before changing it. 
What do I not understand? 
I do not understand much about that fancy fiancé lingo but unbacked securities are like you are trying to sell pink slips.  The money on it has been made and their business model  isn’t going to pan out nicely for them.

All I hear from you is that I should short them. They are not real and can not be backed. They have no place in a market dependent on security. (Which is the value of their product)
Where no one is responsible. I am all for crypto company investments,  but coin will fall off for the fact that it is not real. The banks will sign on with a good product which is backed. And coin will be a speck of dust if they don’t get contracted. (Your investments disappear in this case) 
They have been beaten to market and they don’t have a product that the government or the people want.
You are going to get fucked by coin.
