This is so obviously written to paint the lighting network in the best light physically possible to the point where are the funny has been drained out of it. 3/10 no To the Moon memes, no Over 9000 memes, not enough memes

Well documented corrupt mods, that's why. I don't come here often because of stuff like this. It's so obviously an ad.

I actually disagree, Brazil politics sucks. Their elected officials are legally not allowed to be committed of a crime, Brazilians want a decentralized mode of exchange that is away from the rampant curruption of its government. 
Not investors, Users.

Bitcoin is about to get an etf; Korean gov is starting an exchange; it was all over he news; all over YouTube... where are you been ALL of 2017? Bitcoin is mainstream now.

I mean lighting network is great but some of the dialogue is cringy more than anything else

Who said anything about coins? I'm thinking things like big data marketplaces

"Fight them with your vote" 
I laughed. This person obviously doesn't understand what the deal is

I wonder if they can cool that shit. 25+ e v e r y summer. -20 every winter mind you tho

That didn't answer their question, it was "how did they arrive at that number as a benchmark for breaking even?"

Consensus leads to intimidation and gridlock. Spare me

Ok let's start with Trump and the senate passing those tax cuts

Drugs aren't inherently bad yo. Some people hawk fent patches. It's a drug, the problem is people are sneaking them into places they shouldn't be

I can't believe what I'm reading, FUCK the average joe! I don't care if he is too dumb to take care of his coins, make him learn let's not give power back to banks!

Bitcoin is backed by the trust that others want to engage with it. Yea it's happened twice now but it's been stable between that 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:52:42


Yea ok there
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:57:29
I like to think of it as a currency backed by the trust that demand for it exists 
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:31:17
We need constant repairs and upkeeping but I think that the tech being developed will directly be serving the people as apposed to a few individuals set on an ever expanding monopoly of social capital. Blockchain was step 0. Lighting network is step 1.

Lmao they are using S12s, or they were like in November, they are probably up to S13 by now
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:35:42
That's not true now that the lighting network is here. Bitcoin credit is now possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:16:10
I laugh when I see people like this thinking bitcoin is inseparable from blockchain, Russia will dump B$ and keep the tech / game theory 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:13:44
We really are living the January 2013 dream!! This is the future we were all imagining!! Bit by bit :)
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:26:05
Obviously the actual entities who are serious about the technology will build an incentive. Governments etc 
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:00:21
Lmao I'm just saying you jiggly little bitch

People thought good would be foolproof, turns out you can print a receipt for some gold. Then they figured out that you could print an iou for the recipe for the gold. 
If you don't think crypto banks won't end up in issuing bitcoin IOUs boy do I have news for you 
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:11:55
Yea well what about a teaspoon of a neuron star? 
It's useless to keep going

You do realize  that google taylors the news sites it shows you on what it thinks you'd like?

Short term it allows bitfinex to print tethers for a while longer.
