That is a simple answer, right now there is little incentive unless merchants pass on on processing fee savings to bitcoin customers.

Thanks,  
Maybe set up a blockchain_operations twitter account, like sendgrid does, so developers can quickly see any issues rather than scrambling to fix issues beyond our control.  
Edit: Still not working.

The problem when anyone sponsors development is that different sponsors will push for certain code changes to gain advantage for themselves.
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:00:40
Great! What was the issue?
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:08:23
I see it is true any slightly negative post gets downvoted, this community needs to lean to stop hiding from the reality of the market right now.

This is more about making people aware, you should also make it publicly known for all users that any comprimised wallets can no longer be used, your staff advised me to change the password...

I think the problem was the wallet/private keys got comprimised by a rogue TOR node, beyond that and password change was usless, just a shame blockchain did not advice me of this (not that I blame them, it was a simple support error under confusing circumstances. )     
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:42:29

@_date: 2013-06-02 22:26:43
I dont think we need to promote this on a specific day, vendors will price things how they see fit. Vendors are about sales they will didplay the BTC price in the way they feel will achive maximum sales.

Many have floated this idea, including myself, but you seem to miss the huge technical engineering to make this possible.

I find it funny that the early adopters and investors in Bitcoin, were criminals using it to launder/hide money, so the way I see it, many criminals are going to become richer than their wildest dreams, that little stash of Bitcoin they forgot to cash out could now be worth millions.

This is very old news, there was an outcry and BTCG reduced its percentage over night
@_date: 2013-08-16 19:42:32
Exactly, and how many people will actually cash in the coin for its digital equivalent?  
Physical coins will just change hands, and people will rarely cash them in, as the physical coin then becomes unusable.  
I highly doubt these coins are produced for one time use.
@_date: 2013-10-13 00:46:24
So your matching system is heavily reliant on manual reviews?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:19:36
I completely agree, if the vendors will not come to the currency, we must create our own vendors.

Two reasons you may need a password:

2. If the private keys were encrypted when you printed them.

It is simply the quickest as it accepts paypal, maybe jump over to bitinstant and make a cash deposit and transfer it to an exchange?
Depends where you are located..
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:59:19
Perhaps, but the thing to consider is bitcoin is decentralized, governments currently do not benefit from its use, so in the current framework, a government would not put off war to defend a trade they do not profit from.  
If bitcoin becomes a true global currency, and the majority of governments surrender their fiat currency in exchange of bitcoin, there would be a real motive to preserve the peace.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:35:25
Indeed, I simply do not understand, but I would love to understand.

I think its time the LB monopoloy is broken, much like we did when the exchanges failed us.  
I know this is bitcoin, but Paypal will wait up to 45 days before making a descion/collecting evidence.  
Escrow can only work if trusted individuals are in place to manage it, there seems to be a lack of competence and logic.  
I would propose a new platform with a jury based escrow service.  
Back to the matter at hand it appears the seller made logical points regarding the evidence which LB had and they read it as a refusal to comply.  
What does ID prove?  
SMS spoofing can be achived with free online tools.  
Simply, this is poorly handeled you have no proof the cash exchange took place, did you ask for a cash recipt, or bank statment showing the withdrawl of the $700? Or are we all ASSUMING the cash was at starbucks.

You do realize a millionaire cashing out is nothing, that is 1000 coins out of a pool of 12 million coins.  
The price crashed back in April and people called it the end of Bitcoin, prices fell from $250 to as low as $30, but if you look at the charts now it is nothing but a blip.  
Look at the charts, we see buy wall for 30,000 Bitcoin at $930, how far do you think it will really fall, with so much money ready to pour in?
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:50:36

@_date: 2013-05-11 13:20:19
the transaction fee?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:26:14
Bitpay if you want to convert it straight to USD, but it is just as easy to buy a cheap android tablet, and use it to generate btc invoices via blockchain.info.  
For online payments just give people your bitcoin address, and ask them to notify you once they have paid along with an order reference. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:28:05

Yes basically, someone could make a fake coin that is not backed by digital bitcoins.  
Or 1 physical bitcoin could be printed on 5 physical coins?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:31:14
A investor can only sell x amount of coins if we have y amount of people ready to buy x amount of coins, if the bid/ask do not match up then we will see falling prices, but with the huge amounts of buy orders in place above $900 I don't see the price tumbling to far.  
When we reached $250 back in April that was pure speculation, this time around, we have many more exchanges, many governments welcoming Bitcoin, institutional investors, 50 to 60 new vendors accepting Bitcoin a day, what we are seeing now is organic growth - just at a very rapid rate.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:01:00
Well here is what I am seeing:

This is exactly what the market needs.
I see a lot of posts about this sort of start up, but it is often done by people without the skill set, knowledge or funding (no disrespect to anyone.)
The system should be distributed and can easily grow to scale, the exchange should be much like the bitcoin protocol its self, where trades are made and verified by the greater community.

Well you should be okay, if the laptop never goes online, the only problem is that a sophisticated virus could piggy back on the USB.  
For example:  
Virus replicates onto USB from online windows PC.  
Virus installs its self on offline laptop when you plug USB back in.  
Virus gathers your private keys (assuming you have them stored) and waits.  
When you plug the USB back in to the offline laptop the virus could transmit your private keys to the USB.  
You then plug that USB back into your online PC, and your private keys are uploaded to the internet.  
This is me being paranoid but it could happen, the best way could be to burn a non re-writable CD every time you want to move a private key/wallet across.

It depends on the type of bot.
If the bot is making trades to skim profit - that is fine in a free market.
If the bot is making trades to manipulate the price - this is a free market, there should be enough resistance so bots cannot influence the price.
If the bot is flooding the server to cause havoc - this needs to be addressed, or we just need 1000 exchanges independents.

Buy in cash and sell for bank wire, and you can make a nice profit.  
So right now in London you can buy bitcoins for cash at ~£434 and sell for wire at ~£469 so that a £35 margin per coin.

A simple solution is send the coins from your change address back to the address of your paper wallet later.  
I do not fully understand the change address, it can be hit and miss sometimes I get a change address, and sometimes I do not.  
I think this is more client based behavior rather than protocol.

Depending on what wallet you are using this is simply your client moving the "change" from the transaction to a new address.  
For example:  
Address 1 contains 10 BTC  
Address 1 sends 1 BTC to Address 2  
The remaining 9 BTC from Address 1 are sent to Address 3 for security.  
(Address 3, the change address will be owned by the owner of Address 1, automatically selected from the pool of addresses contained within your wallet.)

I would start with blockchain.info - it is simple and easy to use, and also comes with a mobile app which is great if you start doing real life trades, this should serve you well for small amounts of bitcoin.  
If you want to store large amounts of coins I would recommend getting set up with an offline armory wallet/ paper backup cold storage.  
Buy from localbitcoin if possible, it is fast and simple, people you meet will generally be willing to help you on your journey.

This is true, but the facts are still the same, the Chinese learnt of Bitcoin and bought in, it was not a nation wide pump, they see it as gold. (Hence the extremely low amount of transactions in China.)  
So the government asked banks not to accept BTC as a form of payment for services, and introduced some basic anti money laundering regulation to the Chinese exchanges - as far as I can see, this has not altered Bitcoins ability to be a great store of wealth.

Correct me if I am wrong, but by importing your public/private key you simply grant yourself access to the coins on your address, so you can send some coins out.   
Your wallet now exists digitally and on paper, once your done just remove the digital wallet again.

True, but they should not still be taking bitcoins if they had any dignity.

Indeed interesting, but they cannot guarantee they then mine the block?

or don't be lazy and type your private key ;)  
Edit: Are you sure your offline wallet is 100% clean, you could already have a virus, which when transmitted to an online PC in anyway could upload your private keys.  Typing the keys manually is best.
