I'm really just in it to pay off my student loans, maybe buy a house, or at least jet-ski.  You never see a sad person riding a jet-ski.

I'm in the same boat, though I got in due to the hype, staying for the technology but it's hard to find information on it all.

I was going to buy 5 Bitcoin back in 2013, but didn't know how. Now I own just bits of s bit.

If you're concerned about a dip, just spread out what you're planning on buying over the course of a month. For example, you want $300 worth, then split that evenly over 30 days or $10 a day. Now in this scenario, if a dip occurs tomorrow and the price goes to $0, you'd only lose $10, now of course it could always double in price in the next day and you'd miss out on $300.

Don't worry, you'll probably become a millionaire, go broke, and back to where you are now by morning

You'll probably become a millionaire and then lose it all as you sleep through the night, lol.

I want to buy more, but I'm stuck waiting on my dollar dollar bills to be transferred in coinbase.

Look at Bond in Casino Royale. He was blindfolded naked to a chair getting his balls beat up and he only needed to say vesper.
