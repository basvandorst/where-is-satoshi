Wow.   Glad you are such a fucking bundle of joy 
Hope nothing ever goes wrong in your life and someone just rubs shit in your nose 
You can politely fuck off now... thank you very much.  (Take that with a grain of salt... and bitterness on MY part.  Not you).

Thanks "DAD"
Look... mistakes happen.  
Site appeared legit.  I researched a video on YouTube about it; and needed to transfer money over to handle some business.  So I gave it a try. 
So: what do I do now?   I actually appreciate your tone... and the lesson here.   What do I do to recover it?  I see the transaction through blockchain.

I've got to look into this as well. 
I don't have a ton, but when it's getting close to 1BTC, I'd rather not lose it!

I will be looking into this for sure.  
Never heard about it until this post (but then again I got some BYC a year ago and just basically left it alone aside from winning $65 worth of BTC on a website). 
Occasionally I've grabbed an addition $10 or so from selling silver. I'll take a look into Coinbase and see about making recurring purchases. Can I transfer from blockchain to coinbase without it costing me anything?

Shrugs... I have no clue. Lol
I never heard of it before. Either one.  
So does it just store your encryption keys or something? 
I really need to get more into BTC.  I gotta figure out how to use it for more stuff!

Never heard of this Trevor thing. 
I saved my stuff on a spreadsheet, and only have BlockChain to access my Bitcoin. 
Looks like I need to explore a bit more. 
I see you mentioned recurring purchases... how does one go about this?   I make recurring sells of silver to get small tiny bits of BTC.

Thanks.   I'll take a look into it. 
Do you have like a card for your Bitcoin account?
