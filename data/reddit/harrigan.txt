I was most interested in the last part of the book that focuses on Bitcoin but it is weak in places. For example, the first solution he proposes for scaling is CoinJoin (p. 235). In his words:


This is misleading. CoinJoin is not a viable scaling solution; it is primarily a privacy solution.
Also, referring to SHA-256 as an encryption algorithm (p. 249) is disappointing.

The scripts are executed separately to prevent the scriptSig from corrupting the scriptPubKey.

Simplicity is an alternative to Bitcoin Script. It is a low-level language but has many features and abilities beyond that of Script. It is one for the distant future. Miniscript is a high-level language that compiles to (a subset of) Bitcoin Script. You can use it today.

Who is running the survey? Can you provide some contact details?
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:01:44
Hmm. You are asking some very personal questions, e.g. approximate average yearly income. I think you need to be a bit more up-front if you want more people to engage. Are you running the survey out of personal interest? Is it part of a wider project? Who are you affiliated with? Are you using SurveyMonkey to record the IP addresses of the respondents? Just my two cents.

I'm not sure I'd want to see my civilisations discover cryptocurrencies. I already have in-game gold that is instantaneously transferable. As their ruler, what benefits would they bring? The only one I can think of is the ability to resist trade embargoes. However, I see lots of downsides -- loss of financial control, libertarianism, anarcho-capitalism... I'd eventually be overthrown!

If, by "researchers who first claimed they discovered Bitcoin was not anonymous", you are referring to  then, I would have to add that we never claimed we "discovered" this. We pointed out that Bitcoin was not inherently anonymous, as was being misreported in many articles at the time. We were able to link the person of interest to a centralized *web-based* Bitcoin wallet.
But I agree with you. Anonymity in Bitcoin is a complicated issue. It is certainly possible to use Bitcoin is ways they make it very difficult, if not impossible, to track a user. It is also possible to leak information very easily.
