 Cash apps okay, still dickeddd with fees. Ledger hardware wallets are the only fully safe option for storage.

Volatility is not good with an intended currency. It’s just the early stages and short term it will always results in a settlement into a little flatline before another surge or dip. Seriously have you purchased BTC before?

Professional miners, guessing they are well aware!

I would say bitcoin tracks USD more on a debt ratio. USD is decreasing as the result of debt, and trust. That’s why we have inflation. This isn’t feasible with bitcoin. Flatlines are okay for a few days no need to start selling off your positions.

Well this is more or less hearsay I don’t have all the answers I’m Italian, but if I’m not misinformed most folk do it through non-localized holdings, through family residing elsewhere. Ofc with bank funds tight atm i assume its going to be a far more restrictive economy as far as wire transfers, WorldRemit, etc, but I suppose if you have that kinda money anything is possible. There’s also demo banks and temp accounts that can be used for crypto purchase. Like I said that’s 50% speculation, just going off what I’ve heard! Maybe I’ll visit and learn more first hand :) cheers

Cash App will charge a like 1.2% fee for selling and you will be charged a miner fee to withdraw to a cash app wallet. Your better bet would be to sell it and wire transfer straight to your bank. Your BEST BET would be to just hang on to it if you don’t need the money. Keep your head up! 
Edit: The miner fee only applies to external wallets!
