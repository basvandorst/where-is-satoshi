Yes, that's also how you lose all of your BTC in a hack. The point is secure trading &gt; insecure margin trading. Even though the reward day-to-day is less. That's how the bigger picture works. Which is what a lot of people previously happy about their gains from shorts are missing. A hack is inevitable, you have to account for that.

Saw that bitfinex had flatlined on bitcoinwisdom. Assumed the site went down and paused trading same as it did a few months back. Came on here to see it was a hack.

Maybe the fact that everyone "lost" in the price down swing made bitfinex user's total loss more consolable. The thought of the price bouncing back so quickly/higher is hard to accept? Not trying to be a jerk, just putting myself in their shoes.

I think this is what we're getting at: Someone has their kid's college savings fund in Penny stocks, wakes up one day and it's all gone it crashed and they lost. Then is upset about the fact they lost it because they needed it. That's your problem! You're supposed to keep that junk in a savings account. If you rely on the money, put it somewhere secure. Yes, there's different purposes for different platforms,  penny stocks and savings accounts are different beasts. So if someone is keeping their college fund savings in an insecure exchange or penny stocks I'm not going to feel bad when they lose it. They should be using a secure exchange or wallet with little to no gains vs. "the high risk high reward" penny stock or exchange that could be hacked.

Have a laugh, it's funny! Part of your said gamble was betting on a hack-free future and they lost. This does help them. Margin trading isn't viable for those who want to buy a motorboat with BTC earnings as the platform used insecure centralization.

Owning 21 Bitcoins, or one millionth of the total bitcoin supply.

Wrong. White paper was 2008. Genesis block was Jan 3, 2009.
