First it was, "HAHA, yeah BTC will be worth something when pigs fly."
Then it was, "Why didnt you invest your money into it?" (I wanted to mine it and offered to pay the electricity bill)
First boom/bubble it was, " Why are you doing this now? You already missed the boat"
Today - Doing everything in their power to sabotage anything i do that has to do with this, im seriously at the point where im just going to let everybody fucking rot, and piss on anything they try to leave me. Or maybe ill burn it all at burning man.
