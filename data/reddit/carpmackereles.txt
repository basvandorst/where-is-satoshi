They crossed that line and others long ago. They present themselves as a free lunch project, but they have been trying to find ways to scam their users without getting caught (without much success, except for a few anecdotal cases of users inexplicably losing large amounts of BTC). See BIP1*48*.
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:38:04


Of course! That's why they are called 'private parts'. Keep your *bitte* private/Keep your *con* private (for the ladies). Why did you make this sexual/decency remark anyway, in a discussion about bitcoins? The rest of your comment was on point.

I'm talking about UASF and how Tone and others were saying they are willing and going to fork off into an altcoin to compete with Bitcoin. It was all bullshit, really. But those declarations clearly showed that he is a shitcoiner at heart. It doesn't matter if he says that he's a bitcoin maximalist or that he hates all alts. His other declarations and actions contradict what he says.
He does not always love shitcoins, but when he does, he makes sure it's the most ridiculous and retarded shitcoin invented, known as UASFCoin ;)
@_date: 2018-09-06 11:47:04


Really? Interesting. If he ever did say that, then he'd be calling himself a scammer and shitcoiner for supporting the attempt to create an altcoin called UASF.

Used to own bitcoins. Soon To own Vase.
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:07:34
He is actually a shitcoiner, more specifically a shitforker. Just hasn't managed to fork away from Bitcoin *yet*, but not for a lack of trying. The fact that he was pumping UASFcoin (and FUDding Bitcoin at the same time) proves that he is a shitforker and a shitcoiner. I still haven't seen a mea culpa from him. This makes me think that it's just a matter of time before he starts publicly doing what shitcoiners do again. Giving it straight to *some* shitcoins means nothing, when he's clearly not giving it straight to *all* shitcoins. He's just a shitcoiner in dirty competition against other shitcoiners.
Edit: I see that there are many shitcoiners upset at what I'm saying, but it's the plain truth.

Well, the francophone population of over 200 million people around the world would understand you very differently from the way you meant. And it's such an odd choice of a word that hardly anyone else would understand you the way you meant either. What are "bitcoin bits"? Everything in computers is in bits. I could hardly come up with a more ambiguous/allusive/hilarious/confusing/deceptive thing to say. Why are you using this word in this way? I think you should think long and hard about that and how it came to be.

UASF was an attempted and failed shitfork. UASFCoin never materialized, but he was pumping it as if it would. He was also saying the exact same scammy as fuck (as he admits) lie that other shitforkers are saying today - that the shitfork (UASFCoin in his case) is bitcoin, which obviously none of the shitforks are. Are you trying to say the same shit? What do you mean "uasf became bitcoin"? No, it did not "win". It never got to play the shitfork competing with Bitcoin game.
That is the exact same scammy as fuck lie as Roger's about his shitfork. Edit: The only difference is that UASFCoin does not even exist.

You are suggesting that we should replace it with something better? I think that removing this obvious obscenity/trolling in the client itself has to happen, by forking the client if necessary.

Hi, Jimmy Song. Pissed off for being a laughing stock?
@_date: 2018-09-29 23:58:35
The issue is that there's a loss of trust with the maintainer. The client used to be the way it made sense, the way I liked it. Then a pull request was made to introduce this obscenity/trolling change (not the first time this was attempted as far as I remember) and most people didn't even expect that such a change had any chance. People like me didn't feel the need to waste their breath any more after having pointed out the obvious in the past (*sacrifice* in that sense). Then, inexplicably, the PR is merged and we wind up with this joke in a release. Apparently this one guy wanted to change the BTC name into a joke, because he *acted* in that direction. What's next? Change the consensus rules contentiously? UASFCoin? The same guy did approve of that, I'm not even joking! Either the trolls get this guy every time they try to troll, no matter how poorly, or he likes the trolling himself. This central authority is *actively* harmful and people are forced to cope on their own or look for alternatives. All he had to do was *not* act stupidly. I guess our situation is not that bad though. We can still use older versions, existing client forks, patches, alternative implementations, etc.

Are you pretending to be retarded? I laid out exactly how I came up to this logical conclusion - with logic and facts. His actions prove unequivocally that he is a shitcoiner. That is all that matters. His words which seem to hint to the contrary don't matter. He talks shit to shitcoiners? Even if he's sincere it does not logically follow that he is not a shitcoiner himself. I even explained why he would act this way: he's in dirty competition against these people. Shitcoiners attack other shitcoiners because they are after the same idiots with money, and they want to get the most for themselves. How are you so retarded that you didn't get the logic the first time I laid it out?

Not in BIP149 UASF where the forking event is a 'surprise' event at some unknown time after activation, at the discretion of any miner.
@_date: 2019-03-12 14:56:51


And then they push proposals that actually let miners decide whether some users can have their bitcoins or not \ (they don't describe it like that, but if you actually read the code this is what it does). So in reality they are promoting the existence of classes: one class of fools that lose control of their bitcoins and another class of certain miners that are being lured with free bitcoins essentially gifted by the fools.
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:17:59
The UASFs are another excuse to fork the blockchain for malicious purposes such as these attacks. Don't underestimate the shitforkers (small or big blockers, doesn't matter).

It is not on me to prove this! It is on the ones claiming patent rights (be they "defensive") to prove their claim which would imply that no one ever had the common sense to apply the obvious general technique in "AsicBoost" that is about as old as block ciphers.

I know that they usually delete honest discussion on sensitive topics like that but anyway I'll post it here too:




u/petertodd, since I know that you know what UASF (promoted by you) does I get that you are not one of the (if any) smart people getting duped by it. Therefore you are one of the more socially harmful scammers trying to scam smart people. Got it. Glad that you spoke the truth about yourself for once.
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:56:34


No, it does not. I think you are trying to manipulate with your insinuations.
The fact is that there is [prior art]( covering what is now referred to as "AsicBoost". This should be the primary and expected reason why they would state that "there isn’t and may never be a patent right over AsicBoost" (note that it does not state *anything* like "there *is* a patent right, but it's open to us now").
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:18:48


So you are saying it was a... scam for miners? To scam them into believing that they have no choice but to... activate segwit which most of them were already saying months and years earlier that they want to eventually activate... hmm... so you are saying that they changed their minds from wanting to activate segwit to... still wanting to activate segwit, so... was there any change of mind after all and where is the evidence for that... and which miners are you even talking about? There are many miners. Or... could it be that there was a... how should I put this... a scam to fool people into believing that a scam for miners successfully scammed "the" miners and made them do things that they didn't want to do and weren't about to do, like some easily controlled herd of sheep, and that therefore bitcoin can be easily centrally controlled, and so here... buy this new shitcoin instead or whatever. And you are saying that miners somehow never saw through the scam and also for some reason didn't take advantage of the scam because they didn't see how or they didn't want to get the money owned by users? So what is it, mr. mod?
@_date: 2019-02-11 11:55:08
I'm not one of the people downvoting good comments, but I can give you the answer to your question:
Empirically, it has proven to be a place where a certain group of people has been exercising power and deception to try and defraud the participants in several ways over several years (often unsuccessfully, to the amusement of people who see what's going on). In effect, this has become the main characteristic of it. In a way, you could say that this is what it is *for*, since nothing else is compatible with its current exploitation and current reputation.
There are other similar places on the internet in a similar situation.

It's a statement of the obvious. But the point is that he's using it as a justification to do it himself. Don't you know it's not always good to do anything that's possible to do?
That said, if most/all people were just wise enough not to be fooled by shitcoins, this might just prevent shitcoiners from launching shitcoins in the first place.
@_date: 2019-02-13 14:08:37


Ah, I see what you did there haha! That's a reference to how he supported the BIP148 shitfork that was hopelessly unsupported, irresponsible and certain to either cause a chain fork or turn out to have no valid reason for existing. And that was a more hopeless and irresponsible version of BIP149. And all this regardless of the good merits of SegWit, which ultimately activated smoothly and safely despite the efforts of those who pushed the BIP148 and BIP149 shitforks. In other words, he already attempted to push similar irresponsible shit himself before. Good sarcasm from you there.

Yeah, such as (to name a few of the Hong Kong agreement signatories as a reminder):
* Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo, Peter Todd ("Bitcoin Core Contributors")
* Valery Vavilov, Alex Petrov (BitFury)
* Jamey Shilliard
* Adam Back ("individual")
* Samson Mow
Almost all of these were UASFcoin shills.


UASFcoin was just another attempted and failed shitfork of their own, similar to the (hard) shitforks that were attempted in those agreements. It was quite clearly no "rejection" of anything, except for common sense. What you wrote right here is completely wrong. Maybe you were thinking of "NoS3X", which was a rejection campaign. If you know that you are ignorant on a topic you should not bring it up and comment on it which could confuse others and spread disinformation, intentionally or not.
