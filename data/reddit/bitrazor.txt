Andreas, 
No doubt about the violation committed by including the ebook link. A Clear mistake from my side and sincere apologies for the same.
I have corrected the same.
And please accept my sincere thanks for this wonderful book and talk sessions you have been doing to impart wealth of precise knowledge to the crypto community.
Also I did not host the ebook, but yes, even mentioning the link here is no less than violation.

Yes. 2 hours can be brought down through technology, but building a believing community and decentralization takes years.
Bitcoin has that, and I am looking forward to L2 solutions for lower tx times.
I have been making security softwares all my life. Products evolve and having a scalability problem down the line is in engineering is a good headache to have which testifies that the product is being accepted and used vastly. 
Technology paves way to overcome these, and scalability is NOT an event but a process.

Yes one time pain but worth the peace and security it offers. Also you can use on multiple devices together.

We all want it that way. But with great power, comes great responsibility.

The book and samples are available on github so you can get a good code starter for hands on, but for production quality code, use readily available opensource frameworks and libraries instead of re-inventing the wheel. Having said that, if you play around the github samples on your own, it will give you good handle and confidence.

I made a 65 sat/byte tx on dec 18, which was not picked up by miners. and then it was booted out from mempool because of known reasons.
It returned back to mempool on 26th dec and got confirmed overnight. since then things are cooler.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:25:10
If any of your wallet address has 0.05 or more BTC, it will create ONE input otherwise you have to combine multiple addresses to make 0.05, that will define number of inputs.
Based on inputs, if they add up to 0.05 + Fee , than you have exact amount to generate one output, otherwise a change will be generated and sent back to you making it TWO outputs, one for transaction and another for change.
Now on website you define inputs and outputs and the address type, if it a normal public key hash address or a multisig script address, and you get the fee estimation.
I know its little tricky that is why I asked the person to simplify the language and options.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:21:04

both of them work on crypto principal called hierarchical distribution (HD). They generate private public key pair using your seed . Private keys always stay on the hardware. No one including owner can access them. They provide you public keys where you can deposit your coins.

How? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:18:47
Yes that is always the option. But splitting the coins across two hardware is equally pointless.
I know in the eventuality of device loss, I wil have to wipe the device and transfer funds to new wallet, which would be easy if I have a spare device at my disposal, but even beyond device loss, there are scenarios like device malfunction or damage besides keeping one in possession of my nominee as estate management.
Its a subjective practice, works for some and may not be for others. I am not into trading, but keep buying regularly and on dips, so not only a HODLer but also an accumulator.
There is not much of a deal with extra 90$ with the benefits it brings, since I already hold coins upwards 50K$.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:13:12
Idea is to hold your keys and hold them securely.
Anything exposed to internet is not secure, either you get compromised or careless and everything is gone.
You can use paper wallet but accessing coins becomes a big pain, hence the hardware wallet.they bring best of bothz securely holding your private keys while allowing secure interface to access and transacr your coins.

Whole point is to find way you can buy things using bitcoin. 
try convincing your local trader to accept bitcoin payment, may be to exchange back after a few days, that way he will be more accepting and educated.
Put a sticker on his shop "BTC Accepted"

At least the illusion is, and for the fact many retail investors pulled back and are yet to return while some bigger players moved to Japan exchanges

I did it for my paper wallet.
Installed electron cash.
First secure your bitcoin by sweeping your paper wallet to a good bitcoin wallet, i used blockchain wallet for convinience.
Once my bitcoins were in my wallet, i imported private keys to electron cash and sent the bcash to bitfinex and sold.
Later i moved my bitcoins to ledger. You can send them back to another paper wallet.

Not extra security.
As a rule of thumb, first secure your valuable asset. So before exposing anythingn to electron cash, send your bitcoins to a wallet and verify they reached there. 
Here is a more paranoid approach:
1. Install electron cash
2. Add your paper wallet public key, see if it is showing a bcash balance
3. sweep one of your paper wallet to bitcoin wallet
4. verify your BTC arrived at new address
5. verify your bacsh balance at your paper wallet address is still unchanged (which means only bitcoins moved)
6. Repeat process for all your bitcoins
7. Once you have secured all your bitcoins, import paper wallet private key to electron cash and cash the Bcash
I follwed this after waiting for a while and understanding everything and risk associated with it:

Not sure about fork time price prediction, but you will definitely get a better price than current one (4850) in a few days. Just keep an eye and your funds ready. anything south of 4400 is good to dip into

The value of bitcoins are mainly because there is no Google or Apple behind it. Its the most democratic currency.
What you r talking about is very similar to crypto dollor, issued, controlled by authorities

Why to keep both seed and device, instead restore seed on device and add a complex pin and store it.
Keep seed elsewhere.
I created a clone ledger for locket usign same seed and i keep seed really secret. Even if i loose seed eventually i can move from one device to another device after flash and new seed
