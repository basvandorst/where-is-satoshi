Wow. Just wow. What are you mining on, a Cray? Yeesh. I was pretty happy with my 1-2 BTC a day. Nice job, and thanks for the proof!

For those interested, you can download the trojan into a **Virtual Machine** (or a Linux host via WINE like I did). Then just fire up Wireshark, monitor all traffic originating from your computer, and start the scam-ware up. You'll pretty quick see the traffic trying to access the FTP server

I'm not too savvy with the subject, but the last time I played around with it, I remember rainbow tables being the fastest method. I also remember there was no way to reverse a password hash; only to calculate hashes and see if they match up with the plaintext. Is this still true? My password was comprised of uppers, lowers, numbers and symbols. Think it's at risk? I'm changing everything to be sure, but I would like to know none the less. What's your opinion?

α ⊂ ß?
EDIT: Have fun deciphering that mobile users!

You must be JOKING! I am literally a couple hours into writing my own script for the same purpose. I took a Reddit break to rethink some JSON work. Haha, your timing killed me. Oh well, it looks like this script is better than the one I was writing anyways. Nice job!

I've mined with Slush for a month or two now and on my own for a few weeks. I made nothing on my own (possibly because of the small time commitment). In any case, I'd normally recommend Slush's pool, but it's gaining a lot of popularity at the moment. I'm going to switch to Continuum since it's based in Canada with me, uses the Score method like Slush's pool, and doesn't have any fees.

I'm calling bullshit. Pics of payout history, or you're a liar liar pants on fire.

That seems more plausible, but then again, that would be a LOT of very large trades.

CTRL+F, don't find password:
Whew! (But there was a moment where it matched the first few characters as I typed it in!)

I'd like to see pictures of the machines themselves. This is nuts!
