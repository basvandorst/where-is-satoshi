I will, but what makes you say there will be a crisis in 2020?

Thanks, and I have used it, I bought a few games with it. And as for no chance of recovery I think your right, I'm glad I posted here so I could get some more input

You right, I'm not going to waste my time with something that doesn't make me money, block chain is cool but it's not profitable.

After listening a bit to all of you, those of you talking and not calling me a troll that is, I guess I'll hold on longer, in the end I have made money off crypto, I put in about half of what I've gotten out over all but I thought this was the end of the road, I don't really have much to lose so I might as well see how it goes.
And just so this is clear it's not that I think Bitcoin is the problem, Bitcoin is epic. My worries are more that people and investors with big money won't adopt it.

Yes, yes it is. And that's what makes me sad to sell off, I just don't have enough to invest to make much when it does spike

I like the block chain technology, is a protocol for truth, it's just it doesn't make sense to stay in something that doesn't make money and has no chance of recovery. It does matter if you all want to hold on to it, you won't make a difference compared to the majority of society not buying in. I wish that Bitcoin was more accepted because it's a very cool thing, that's why I bought in, in reality though, it doesn't work.
