From what I understand no one knows when LN will be announced but lots of people think it's imminent. So selling soon is safe as it's not a majority opinion that bch will double (or increase wildly) before then. Thanks, I also believe it will be worthless, just trying to see what other r/bitcoiners have done with theirs.

Is it a problem if the majority of people holding bitcoin are only holding because they want to make a profit and turn it into cash? And is the power usage associated with mining and transactions sustainable with more and more adoption?
As a beginner reading up on bitcoin it seems like these two 'problems' keep coming up again and again from reasonable sounding people, and I don't really understand how these points aren't damning. Thank you for the video!

Thank you for answering and forcing me to read PoW and PoS's wikipedia entries. It seems like switching from PoW to PoS would radically alter BTC as I (vaguely) misunderstand it, and has its own problems of people somehow simulating it &amp; stealing currency or there no longer being any 'stake' in spending real-life resources to mine and so therefore the chance of an attack on the network goes way up...
Totally a layman's reading from me &amp; you said 'non-PoW' as though there are more alternatives too. No need to comment again, just posting this in case anyone else wants to chime in &amp; to leave up more info in this valuable post. Thanks again for your talk, I agree with the others that there is public-speaking talent there.

Love the strong hands weak hands answer, that makes sense. Maybe the crashes will be significant but BTC will move to stronger hands and crash less severely.
I'm sorry but I don't fully understand your second answer? I thought bitcoins power consumption was uniquely 'wasteful' and I've seen some alarming headlines recently: 'BTC currently uses as much power as Denmark, BTC will need all the world's energy by 2020' etc. Are you saying we already use a shit ton of power on our current financial institutions and so why can't we devote some of that to BTC? I guess I thought BTC mining was super intensive and that wouldn't make a huge dent... if we all believe in BTC continuing to grow and gaining mass adoption.

Thanks, looking for opinions just like this. I understand it's playing with fire holding on to something you don't believe in. But if those death throes net me more $1,000's to put into bitcoin I'd obviously like to wait.

Yeah jeeze, I'm very tempted to sell. No one can predict anything but in my head I'm thinking 'well, what if the next ATH before a pump and dump has an even higher ratio' and then of course I wait and it plummets forever.

Yeah, the ONLY reason I haven't sold at 3,000+ is because of this super small fear. I really doubt it'd ever beat bitcoin, but what if it survives in some way and just increases a ton in value (along with bitcoin).

Sure, and I bought some bitcoin early-ish and plan to hold until it hits $0 or $X, but my comment was more like: you shouldn’t gamble on the day-to-day movements of the already succesful replicator’s stock price.

Can someone read Arthur Chu’s responses to Krugman’s take and refute them for me? Losing faith left and right and I’ve always thought Chu was a smart dude.

It’s an answer to you! Your take, which makes sense. I’m almost wilfully ignorant, and I believe if we posed your view to the bitcoin community we’d get plenty of sensible disagreement. (From guys who in a broad sense ‘believe.’)
I’m advocating punting by holding if you can afford to, and ignoring day trading, because I don’t particularly trust the naysayers that much more than the believers.

The good thing about only being in it for the money is that if the guys who truly believe in the tech are right, my speculating won’t matter much because their genuis still wins out. I agree though of course, bad signs abound.

Artifical scarcity was baked into bitcoin so this information hasn’t been new for every defense and takedown and every run/rally, my expectation for value isn’t based on a negative or positive view. It’s not rationalized beyond ‘hey the price of this thing has shot up before’ and the flighty urge to seize on that volatility the moment it nets me six figures.

I’m at a crossroads because of all the people parroting ‘this always happens’ and referring to charts of bitcoin’s whole history, and all the people saying the market has realized it won’t be a good currency and the brief ‘going mainstream’ and ATH moment has passed.
And then I realize I don’t fully know how the tech works and I’m in it for $$$, reading a bunch of other panicky fellas on reddit and twitter.
I’ve had greater peace of mind when I ignored my bitcoin from 2013 to late 2017. Everyday the news and hot takes change, some good stuff happens and then some crazy bullshit. A vast majority of the content on crypto subs is memes or hyperbole, and despite all that pockets of articulate and thoughtful discussion pop up... followed by an equal amount of reasonable disagreement.
I think all you can do is tune out. It’s fun and like a drug to think you’re forming a different gameplan, like you’re gleaming some crucial nugget from Nathanial Popper’s new piece or from an articulate 10-year-redditor deep in the Ethereum sub. But it’s all for naught if you’re investing. Nobody can predict shit.
