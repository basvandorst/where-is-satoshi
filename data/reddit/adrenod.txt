Its an influence of mainstream actors. They do not want masses to get awareness on crypto investing.

I diversified but I'm not laughing at myself. I initially did invested in some shitcoins that I realized only later.
So yeah, diversification with crypto does help as not all crypto projects are equal.
When you say "don't put all eggs in one basket", you don't mean getting more eggs out of it, you mean you lose less if any one basket falls down (a.k.a., any crypto project fails and/or shuts down).
While its true that diversification in crypto is not same as diversification on other asset classes, it still helps.

What RT has quoted on this page:
“The government does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender or coin and (will) take all measures to eliminate the use of crypto assets,” 
What actually the FM has announced:
"The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets *in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system*"
RT just retained what elevates their intention. Mainstream media has come down to so low level that we no more care what they say.

World is too diverse to embrace a single currency for all. Hence the idea of using a single currency for everything(or most of things) by every country is a distant dream that can go at least another 5 generations.
But what can happen is cryptocurrency will be embraced for individual utilities(e.g., ABC coin is approved by X countries for use in Solar, or Sports, education etc.,) because of the benefit it provides than traditional transactions. There will surely be resistance initially but governments cannot make dumb by themselves for long. 
These are early days for crypto, but governments already announcing they will NOT ban crypto, but instead regulate it. This implies they are recognizing its benefits already. Soon in another 5-10 years, every country wanted crypto deployment when things get clear. Note that its not one bitcoin/anothercoin by all countries, but individual purpose cryptos by each countries (or cross countries agreed upon).
So cryptocurrency is here to stay, just that it will be regulated.

You just confirmed alts will not raise until BTC reached ATH. Actually, I have no technical reason for that, its just my observation that alt coins raise slow irrespective of BTC's speed. So wishing BTC to reach another ATH, but bit slower than this(Now it looks slowed down).

Altcoins cannot cope up with this speed. They will stay far behind if BTC continues this pace.

Because most people can only see what is showcased to them - the word "Bitcoin".

Gold is mostly a commodity than a currency in historical context too. You get coins of that kingdom by exchanging your gold when you travel there. With those coins, you actually buy your food and utilities. 
For today's context, every country standing up to replace their currency with one universal crypto is highly unlikely, considering differences in cultural, religious and economic situations. Btw, I just say it will take time, not that its never possible. I believe people will be more inclusive as generations pass by (hopefully).

Because if you spend with Bitcoin, you will buy more. If you keep buying more btc to spend, chances are higher that you can buy more/better things in future than with Fiat.

And what Bitcoin said? "Not Today".
