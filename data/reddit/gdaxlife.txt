@_date: 2018-02-11 18:46:26
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:19:11
Well fuck my bad. I wrongly assumed that you knew the mempool was empty and transactions can be carried out for one 1sat/b
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:40:19
You could just give any receive address off the public key itself to obtain something you would want to post in public.  Xpub to Sentinel [app], then generate a receive address [+] in app, and post that for your public addy.
