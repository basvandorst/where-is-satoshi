Well you can hold BTC and then if you want the privacy for whatever reason, use a privacy token like Monero. Best suggestion. 
Alternatively if you mine your crypto that’s pretty untraceable.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:54:19
It’s a little bit hard for me to work out. If you had your private keys or a seed phrase, you’d be able to access your bitcoin. If you used an online wallet and could log on, you could access them like that. If you only have the public wallet address then you’re out of luck I’m afraid.

Bitcoin is entirely about trusted third parties. Was written into the genesis block. Have no more time to waste with this, I’m sorry if you can’t see the point. Maybe read the white paper.
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:03:30
My point is you risk 1x with a potential upside of 100x. Therefore, for me at least, it makes a lot of sense to invest in this asset. 
Don’t know how to make that clearer.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:47:37
I think it will depend on the person, with a minimum at 10%. If you’re fairly young and employed, you can make money back that you’ve lost pretty easily. To that end you can afford to invest more in a volatile asset. That’s the way I’d look at it.

@_date: 2019-07-24 09:39:40
It’s practical enough for me to chuck $1000 a month into it. I’d assess the market and of course there would be a price in the short term I would stop buying, anticipating the beginning of a new bear market. If BTC hit 100k towards the end of 2020, I would stop buying and probably sell some of my non HODL position. The reason being is to wait for an 80% retrace and buy more BTC. Once BTC tops out this bull market and 80% retraces to 20k, you will be buying sats at 20k laughing/crying at this post.

Ah so what you’re after is an exchange which doesn’t require KYC (know your customer). I think you’re going to struggle in this day and age, but I’m not sure where to recommend as I use coinbase. I have no problem really with them knowing that I bought some BTC.

I think that’s the interesting point. I imagine a lot of it is hobbyist miners who couldn’t see it going anywhere (RIP).

Robin Hood doesn’t give you actual BTC as I understand it. Never used it though. 
It’s essential to own your own private keys, OP. To that effect, the easiest way to get BTC is to buy it from an exchange like coinbase or Binance and then transfer it to a hard wallet like a ledger nano S/X. Do your own research, but *critical* to own your own private keys. Not your keys, not your crypto.

The others also attempt to effectively spell sat within a symbol. Bit of a stretch, but maybe it gives someone an idea.
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:24:53
Very well written post. LN has potential for the every day transactions. Visiting the same coffee shop regularly or the same store. I just fail to see how it helps if an individual travels to another country and conducts a lot of one-off payments to different vendors. A one off lightning transaction ends up being a one-off on chain transaction. So whilst some of the burden can be taken on by side chain solutions, I don’t think it’s enough to mitigate away from the overall on chain scalability problem. There will still need to be alterations made.
As for altering the main network, I see two things that can be altered to increase transactions per second. There is increasing the block size, which is talked about very frequently for obvious reasons. There is also the option of lowering the difficulty rate to have blocks mined in half the time, with half of the amount of rewards. Miners will not suffer, and not should security as the difficulty of producing longer chains will remain more or less the same. Just my thoughts, but curious to see what you think about that.

And what was it in 2015 or 2013. 4% looks small, and that’s potentially excellent news or bad news depending on where you are in the lifespan of an asset. If you believe we are still early in the life of BTC, this is remarkable. It’s a great foothold and yet low enough that you have an excellent investment opportunity ahead of other people.

Upper end of that I feel. We’ll be picking up passengers along the way. Pretty ridiculous gains throughout 2020 before a capitulation some time probably in Q4. I will start exiting from about 50k onwards so I can buy more BTC during the bear market (and maybe a Lambo).

I understand bitcoin itself pretty well. Still pretty sure I understand LN reasonably well but as you said, you don’t have time to explain why I don’t, and why my suggestion that single transactions with single vendors wouldn’t be helped by lightning as they’ll just end up on the blockchain as any normal one would be. 
But clearly you ‘don’t have time’, so let’s leave it here. All irrelevant to this current post at any rate. Sorry we can’t all he as technically and artistically gifted as yourself.
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:36:13
No, and then we’ll parabola ourselves into a bear market. But what’s good is that then even more people will know how to buy it. We’ll shake out weak hands, decline, and begin the cycle over again (maybe for one of the last proper market cycles). Even when we have these market retracements, and people lose money because they’re weak in the market, the market has still gained a bunch of people. We’ll recoup at the bottom, bring in new people, and power through again. 
What BTC now really needs to do is find unique use cases. Things people desire which you can only buy with BTC. That comes from the community and it’s an area we’re seriously lacking in, I feel. Everything you can buy with BTC is either purchasable by fiat also OR very crypto orientated. Having non-crypto related desirable items that can only be brought with crypto almost forces adoption. If we want this to succeed, the onus is on ourselves to drive it forwards in many respects. This should be done by thinking about crypto outside of our crypto community. 
All of the hype for institutional investors is a little misplaced in my mind. Let’s bring ordinary people to the space and stop pandering/begging for institutions to be involved in it.

What’s ironic is that they will frame this as ‘protecting’ you. However they will allow you to transfer money to a hedge fund or a gambling website. It’s not to protect you from losing money, it’s to protect them from losing your money.

I’m not meaning to me negative. I think if we want to see regular investors interested we actually need to start saying ‘I bought 5,000,000 sats’ instead of 0.05 BTC, so I applaud this concept entirely. Just find the slant a bit visually jarring.

Rather than just stating that I’m wrong, why don’t you attempt to explain it to me. If I go to a. Vendor one time and order a cup of coffee, paying using the lightning network, me and that vendor open a channel. That channel gets immediately closed and becomes a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain. Therefore Lightning has done nothing to alleviate these one off transactions from the blockchain.

Don’t use Robinhood. 
It’s only $100 of dirty fiat so give it a try. If you really want to trade pick your spot and leverage trade on something like bybit or Bitmex. You’ll probably get rekt and learn to HODL, but it’ll be an experience.

So like I pointed out in another comment, my faith in Lightning to solve the overall coming burden is limited. It works for people making multiple transactions from the same vendor, and that’s great. However, it does nothing to reduce singular on chain transactions to different vendors. That would be very common for anyone travelling, and we are talking about a global currency here.

Interesting enough, mining 64mb blocks every 2 seconds seems remarkable. The difficulty would have to be very easy, but not sure what the implications are for security. On the one hand easy targets for hashing would mean less security, but if there is a new block every two seconds then an attacker would struggle to stay on top of that. I wonder how a blockchain can be developed at that pace too. I’d honestly love to hear from others their thoughts on this.

They’re not trying to stimulate the market. 
The whales will go onto a leverage trading site, place a large short on leverage, and then force the price to drop by selling a large amount of BTC. On the way down longs will be liquidated, the whale can buy back the BTC over time and have all of the profit from the leverage trade. Honestly it’s like printing money for them.

I mean it would work, but you have to weigh up if it’s worth it and also how much BTC you actually want. There are charts online where you can look at how much certain GPUs would net. However with the hashrate so high the returns are very low right now.

Nah you put all your BTC ON 100X leverage and no longer have it, remember?
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:32:22
I think that’s shortsighted. These days, central banks print more fiat to battle recessions. They’re not printing value, but stealing it. People know that and hedge their dollars in other assets like gold, albeit often with the intention of selling on the other side for more fiat than they paid for, thus protecting their value. 
If this is what we see then BTC’s price could rapidly rise in the pre and early stages of a recession.

Not a mathematician but it would ‘only’ need to be 10 mill for your 0.1 to be worth 1mill, not 100 million. 
I think in reality we could see a few months below 20k if it’s on the trajectory we believe it is. Assume something modest like 20k EOY and work gradual inclines per month off of that. It may go to 8.5 this month, and then 13k next month, but that’s probably a best guess. Then calculate the average salary, how much an individual would be able to invest over the next few months and see what you come out to. At a guess, 0.5 BTC unless people utilise savings. I still believe that could be life changing wealth. If it hit 300k with a market cap similar to gold, 150k is a house they wouldn’t otherwise have had. Once your house is paid for at a young age, you’re not wealthy but very comfortable.

If you are going to mine anything, however, best suggestion would be something like Monero or Ethereum which are ASIC resistant, so your GPU may still have some effect. 
Once done, you can convert to Bitcoin or keep that crypto. Note that if you have a coinbase account ETH would be better because it is available to trade on coinbase.
Best thing, as previously mentioned, is in reality just to buy small amounts each month and hold. Whatever you think you can afford to spend and won’t be upset if the value drops 50% or whatever. For some people that could be $40 a month, for others it’s $400. 
Learn about what bitcoin is and why those who actually understand it are almost universally in love with it.

That hasn’t really answered his question. 
Basically, if you increase the block size, keep in mind that the nodes will need to download more data every ten minutes. Now, if the block size doubled, that wouldn’t necessarily be a problem. However, if the block size went to, say, 200mb, that could be a real problem. The reason being that people running small nodes wouldn’t be willing to have their internet downloading 1.2GB every hour, 24/7. As a result the ‘smaller’ nodes would simply switch off and there would be fewer nodes, which does increase centralisation. 
However, in the future it’s likely that worldwide access to the internet will steadily improve, and people will be willing to run nodes and accept much larger blocksizes. I hope that somewhat helps.

Your advice is from the perspective of someone who bought at the top. The best thing you’ve done is not sell the bottom. The fact that you are HODLing is a sign that you aren’t even sure about what you yourself have declared, that this is a sucker’s game. 
Of course you are quite right that you cannot time the market, but also you do not need to. Two years is not a long time in the world of investing.

It’s looking very bearish on pretty much all timescales except the monthly, and I don’t know how accurate we can judge that. If we hold 10,600 for a couple days I’ll change my tune but there seems to be so much selling pressure right now. HODLing as always, I don’t sell, but fully expect it to come back down now.

I also believe in the model. Read some research trying to debunk it and it basically it concluded the connection is non-spurious. All it really predicts is fair value and the market will do the rest. Was produced with data up to 2012, therefore the 95% accuracy has not been hamfisted in. In fact, to see that it is non-spurious, one only needs to consider that this was the whole point of scarcity and halvings.

Well, Satoshi introduced block size caps later in the development of bitcoin. The reason was fairly apparent, to stop someone sending an enormous number of transactions (back when Bitcoin was very inexpensive) and creating 1GB blocks. This would have hurt the blockchain forever, as it’s size would always have reflected those larger block sizes at the beginning. This could have been done for very little cost. However, this isn’t really a problem anymore with transaction fees and the general price of bitcoin. 
To that end, there is some sympathy from my part with the attempt to increase block size to 8mb and ease up some of the tensions of long waiting times. In fact, if it was proposed as a way of simply speeding up block times rather than as a method of creating a ‘cash’ and that with 8mb blocks the ledger can be used for every day transactions, then that would actually make a lot of sense to me. At some point I truly believe that bitcoin will actually have to increase block size and I’m sure consensus will be reached on that point when the time is right. 
However, increasing block size should be seen as a response to demand in accordance with technological capability. It is not something to be taken lightly. The reason is simple:
Bitcoin is decentralised because of the people around the word running nodes. Running nodes and using your internet to download a maximum of 12mb per hour on your internet connection is generally not taxing for those nodes. Also, as the blocks are small, the entire 10 year blockchain currently is only around 240GB. That’s important too since those full nodes MUST be able to store the entire chain. At present, a 1TB hard drive should give nobody any problems for quite some time. 
Now consider something like BSV with 256mb block size limits. Sounds great, right? No. 
Rumour has it they even want to increase block size to 2GB. Imagine that people used BSV for every day transactions and block sizes were on average 2GB or whatever. Within 500 ten minute periods the blockchain would fill your entire 1TB drive. Furthermore, anybody running a node would be insane to allow their internet connection to just passively download 12GB of data every hour. Nodes would understandably switch off and your system becomes extremely centralised. 
So there is, to cut a long story short, an interesting conversation about block size. I think it will need to increase in the future, frankly, but it can never really be seen as a place to settle all transactions unless technology makes some pretty ridiculous leaps forward. 
P.s. I can think of solutions to solve the physical hard drive issues. However, nothing to solve the internet connection problem. I don’t think increasing block size to solve scalability for everyday transactions is even remotely plausible at present
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:46:54
Well written. If give you gold but you’re already premium, so I’ll save it for someone equally eloquent. 
You make some very good points, I have no intention of disputing them. However, I didn’t mean quadrupling the block size for the sake of it, I meant that we could do it in response to increasing transaction volume and fees becoming a sticking point. Call it blockchain easing if you like. The miners will receive less in fees per block, but the fees will be lower for the majority and we should expect that if we are in this situation then the blocks will be getting filled.   To me in that kind of situation it makes sense to increase block size, although that requires consensus and might not be easy to achieve quickly. I can see no technological limitation for most miners to increase the size a few x.

To be clear, I love this creation for the technology. I really do. What we need to advance the technology, in my opinion, is growing adoption and that likely stems from increasing price. As adoption increases, hopefully vendors will consider things like taking bitcoin payments and lightning payments etc. Probably first large online retailers and then in shops, and then everywhere. So don’t assume that those focused on price are *only* focused on price.

By no means am I negative about Lightning. I am looking to run a node in the near future and I think that, philosophically, it is one of the *best* possible solutions. 
I just really want to dispel certain viewpoints. I think Bitcoin can scale without lightning, just perhaps suboptimally, and sacrificing some of the original philosophy of the project, though not most of it. I want Lightning to work, but also want people to realise that it isn’t the only scaling solution, and thereby dispel the myth that if Lightning fails, Bitcoin can’t scale.

That’s fine I’ll buy it. You’d have to fundamentally misunderstand what this is to want to dump it at 10k. 
Also realistically the amount of slippage this would create would probably push the price down sub-1k. Now, why would you do that when you could sell to institutional investors at a discount. I.e. sell to Bakkt for 9k? Best thing to do would be reach out to miners and ask who they sell to directly, although they might not appreciate the competition. 
In all, if it happened we’d buy it all up and then it’s simply not a problem anymore. 
Also Craig Wright has no coins and plustoken plebs in jail so this is just FUD.
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:10:37
I don’t think it will happen that fast, but it’s interesting. If you look at one of my other replies in here, I think the only thing that could make BTC accelerate like that is a recession and a divergence between stock value and crypto, driving investor FOMO.

Do you buy bitcoin? If so, I’m not sure what worth your argument has about bitcoin dropping. You can accept bitcoin and use that to offset the bitcoin you buy. 
If you don’t buy bitcoin and have no interest in this space, knowing that it will be unlikely to fuel sales very much, I wouldn’t bother. Seems like a lot of hassle for you. Integrate it in ten years time when you quite literally have to, and repent that you hadn’t done so before.
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:14:13
BCASH have had some problems with people hypermining blocks before an adjustment and basically abusing it. I’m not tracking that bitcoin has a problem though? 
Shortening might seem logical, but only so far. There will be small periods of time where blocks are just mined faster by chance. If the difficulty is adjusted too often, then following those brief ‘lucky’ periods, the difficulty would be an unnecessary burden to miners.
Anyway, whilst it could be shorter, why bother? If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.

I imagine they’re not. Ten minutes is a rough figure based on difficulty. If nobody produces a good hash for twenty whole minutes then it’s twenty minutes.

Satoshi Pakamoto, is that you?
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:00:07
So one other thing to keep in mind, when people make the more outlandish predictions like 10 million, they can be thinking about it in two ways. Firstly, the US dollar still exists and bitcoin is quite literally exchangeable for 10,000,000 USD. That’s actually more achievable (although insanely moonish) because you can burn the candle at both ends. Firstly, bitcoin appreciates in value. Secondly, the USD depreciates in value. So if the USD depreciates by 10x and bitcoin appreciates by 100x, you’d get there. However, one bitcoin would only buy you 7 or so Lamborghini Huracans.
The flip side is when people say that bitcoin will be worth the purchasing equivalent of 10,000,000 USD today. So say you can buy 70 Huracans for that. In the future, whether or not the USD exists is irrelevant, what they’re saying by saying BTC will be worth 10,000,000 USD is that it will buy you the same amount of... Lambos or whatever, as 10,000,000 USD would today. 
It’s really important to understand in which way they are saying it will go to a certain price, as there is a difference of 63 Huracans between the two predictions. They are often unclear and that might be deliberate. 
I think this should help a lot better, but who knows. No problem for the replies my dude.

Well banks would likely have a certain amount of bitcoin only now they would need to be extraordinarily careful with who they lend to. Rather than just handing out capital however they wish, they’d need to do their due diligence because if too many people default on loans, the bank simply will collapse. The government will not bail out private banks (which would largely be lenders at this point), who were irresponsible with their capital using a genuinely scarce money they can’t manipulate.
In short, bitcoin would promote genuine financial responsibility.

@_date: 2019-08-04 20:23:19
In what respect?
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:49:43
Aw shit, here we go again. 
Firstly, bitcoin is decentralised. There is no central authority that manages it. Balances of individual wallets are stored on a public ledger which is held up by thousands of nodes around the world. As this is decentralised, there is no ability for governments to manipulate the eco system. That means that governments cannot print more money to fund wars, bail out banks, buy weak stocks and so on. That’s the first good point. 
The system is extremely secure. It is maintained by the ‘miners’ who are actually hashers. What they are doing is taking transactions from the ‘mempool’, the pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed and placed onto the blockchain. These transactions, along with things such as the Merkle Root and the previous block’s block header hash, are all placed into something called the block header. This header is then placed through a hashing algorithm (SHA256) which produces a string of numbers. The bitcoin protocol determines how many zeroes this hash must start with and that is the difficulty. The difficulty is increased if blocks are being mined too quickly to ensure a block is mined approximately every ten minutes. These miners, if they are the first to hash the block header by following the correct rules and achieving the correct amount of leading zeroes, publish their block to nodes. The nodes check the block and, if valid, add it to the blockchain. They are rewarded with a ‘coinbase’ transaction. These are brand new bitcoins given to the miner. That block with all of the transactions is then added to the blockchain. 
Why is it called a blockchain? Because the blocks are connected by including the previous block’s hash into the new block. What this means is that in order to change something on the ledger, you’d need to also mine all of the block’s afterwards and add their blocks to the blockchain. Their blockchain would need to be longer than the valid one, meaning that they would need more computing power than all of the honest miners.  Currently that would require an unimaginable level of computing power. More miners = more security. The blockchain has never been hacked, despite being an excellent target. So, security.
Bitcoin is also scarce. The number of bitcoin being produced halves every four or so years. So finally we have a money system that is genuinely scarce and can’t simply be printed out of thin air. 
There’s just a few things to sink your teeth into. I’ll answer questions.

Then convert it to GBP. How would converting to any other currency be favourable unless you either a) anticipated a change in the exchange rate between the other fiat and GBP or b) there were favourable reasons from your crypto exchange to withdraw to another currency. Nobody else can answer that for you and it’s so patently obvious that you should be just withdrawing into your own currency. 
If you withdraw to the Euro you’ll have to do a SEPA payment with your bank from the exchange or convert within your exchange probably at some fee. 
I just can’t believe you’re seriously asking this question. Withdraw your 100k sats to GBP and buy that packet of smokes.

The reasons you wanted to invest in bitcoin still exist. Keep your keys on a cold wallet, dude. 
Have a look at on chain transactions and if you think it’s more than a one off, you can try to red flag it with exchanges maybe (I think unless there’s a lot of stolen coins they probably don’t have the resources to track it).

Is it the perfect market? It involves you entering other people’s properties, often without them ever meeting you. If you have a pre KYC wallet and registered with false details, you’d be totally anonymous to Airbnb/owners. I think that could be dangerous. 
Oh and by preKYC wallet I just mean you bought bitcoin ages ago, stored it in a wallet, and have never had to go through an exchange’s KYC process. Alternatively if you buy it peer to peer etc.

Sure. There is nothing that BCH can do that BTC can’t with consensus. Lightning in my opinion is a nice to have, but not essential for scalability. 
I have created a post within the last 12 hours about scalability in here, so I think you’d find that interesting. I’ll sum it up as the following:
The blockchain is a ledger, much the same as a central bank’s ledger. Central banks don’t process everyday transactions, and so it’s nonsense to expect the blockchain to do the same. To say that it does not is not to say that it has failed. The blockchain is a central bank ledger replacement. Given that central banks don’t process everyday transactions, why should it be expected that the blockchain should? 
In reality, off chain solutions will be those which work. Lightning is one example in development. In reality, something like visa could be developed over the top. This involves a third party, but not with your entire funds, just a small part. 
To try to increase blocksize to make the blockchain handle every single transaction is nonsense. In reality off chain solutions could come in a plethora of forms. I imagine third party payment processing firms, the likes of which currently exist for fiat and could be easily achieved for bitcoin. 
In fact, to try to scale the blockchain for every day transactions is not only missing the point, it’s harmful to the blockchain. You would require severs GB blocks. Who is going to run a node downloading well over 10GB every hour and where would they store a 100tb blockchain, ever expanding? So you would lose nodes and become centralised. 
In reality third parties can aggregate payments to merchants and then settle them in one much larger transaction on the blockchain. So blocksize does not need to be particularly large and those third parties only need to be trusted with small amounts of your wealth. 
Hope that makes sense but feel free to check out the much larger post. ����

@_date: 2019-08-11 22:15:09
Only thing I might say is that previous ATH was 20k, the one before that was 1,100. That was an 18x increase. So halving the bubble tops would be a 9x taking us to about 180k. Slap in the middle of your prediction. I also predict a lessening of volatility, so we would then come down to around a 30k level imo, before having a 5x again through 2024/5 taking us to around a 800k - 1mill BTC. 
That’s assuming that bitcoin just follows previous cycles. Of which we haven’t had many. Those price predictions tie in beautifully with the stock to flow ratio models from plan B, but who knows!? Will people really be willing to pay that much for BTC? People get into the space now in the hope it might reach lofty heights, but would they still do that at 400k+? I’m not so sure. We’d need to see real bitcoinisation by then in my opinion in order to continue. Also the previous cycles really will have to desist at some point. A further cycle would take us to 2.5mill, then 4? Then 5.5? Seems lofty to me.
@_date: 2019-08-04 19:53:31
Interesting. I think there’s a lot of people who expect the recession to be good for bitcoin, but I’m not too sure why. Just because Bitcoin and gold have similar money properties (scarcity etc) that doesn’t mean they will perform similarly in a recession. The problem is that gold has been tried and tested to perform well as a store of value through a recession, but bitcoin never has. 
In short, bitcoin will only do well in a recession if investors see it as a store of value or it is moving upwards inversely correlates to stocks. If that DOES happen, then the run could be huge. All that might be required is for an initial drop in stocks and increase in the price of bitcoin for investors to try and diversify into it, protecting their wealth. That initial diversification would increase the disparity between falling stock prices and increasing crypto prices as more investors follow suit. If that happens we could honestly see some growth that would shatter current expectations for 100k this cycle.

Peter Schiff is very smart. I think this will proves to be the biggest mistake he ever makes. Unfortunate because we’re really on the same side. Bitcoiners typically can see the value in gold, but more of it in bitcoin. Goldbugs have stacked gold like crazy because they thought it was the only option to oppose fiat, and it may have been for a while. But that has changed and I think it’s a tough cookie to swallow when you have 100kg of gold sat in a vault somewhere. Unfortunate, but he’ll come around.

‘In principle’, and actually if the miners confirmed the blocks being produced as accepting, say, a 25 BTC reward, then it would be added to the blockchain and the coinbase transaction would be paid out. 
I didn’t ask if it was likely, I asked if it was possible.
@_date: 2019-08-31 19:57:59
My first premise is not wrong. The blockchain is a ledger. It is analogous to a central bank ledger for payments to be settled on. It is not meant to be a payment processor. It is being used as a payment processor currently because we are in the nascent. 
Lightning has difficulties, yes. As if any complicated program could be created without them. It is not the only solution. Stop thinking the success of bitcoin is inextricably tied to the success of Lightning, though it would help. 
Given that visa is just a payment processor that settles on your bank’s ledger, I see no reason a similar system could not exist for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:15:35
I like this post. Because you’re right, currently not a lot of stores will accept it. And that means we’re still very early. It means we’re still in the high risk, high reward area. By the time it is accepted all over the place, the endgame is becoming clearer. The risk is significantly less and so is the reward. The price by then will be much higher. 
If you simply wish to buy a coin to purchase things in the short term, regular fiat cash is still better. But that will not last.

Unbelievably stupid point. That’s because gold is extremely hard to spend, so educating employees about how to receive it, weigh it, verify it and so on is not worth the hassle for a couple of TX. On the other hand bitcoin is easy to educate people about how to receive, divisible, easily provable etc. 
They may actually take gold in the future if we move to the idea of holding a reserve of gold in a vault which is assessed electronically and can be spent on a card, the in-house transaction being moderated by the vault that holds the physical gold and transferring X ounces from a person to a store.

Further, the only reason it would make a tangible difference to the price is if they held like 100k bitcoin regularly in circulation. The price is just a feature of buying pressure vs selling pressure. If the Winklevoss twins lost access to their private keys, nothing would happen to the price whatsoever (less for some mild speculation about their being significantly fewer in circulation now).

@_date: 2019-08-31 07:52:05
Sorry, I’m working through comments one at a time. Just made a very long comment about how I think block size will need to increase, but not with the premise of placing everyday transactions on it, just because even with offchain solutions and mass adoption, block size would need to increase. I also discussed my reasons for thinking block size increase probably cannot be the answer due to increased centralisation stemming from technological limitations. I also went into another comment and said that I don’t like the idea of paper money backed by bitcoin as gold would be a similar solution people would gravitate towards, so our thoughts are clearly aligned in many respects.
I think the reason bitcoin has a great shot not at being a ‘backing’ but an actual currency stems from the idea that, if fiat collapses and the value of bitcoin rises, people will gravitate towards exchanging fiat for bitcoin due to self interested reasons. Merchants will want to receive bitcoin, not fiat. Typically, bad money drives out the good because people only wish to spend the bad money, right? However the inverse is also true, merchants only want to receive good money, so they very quickly will adopt ways to receive whatever they perceive to be good money. Solutions will rapidly come about and there you have it. I’m not saying this is certain, just has a much better chance than people might imagine.

Haha, thank you to both of you! 
This is my personal opinion of what I think *will* happen. However, let’s say the odds sit at 5%. Let’s then say that at this point the rewards of it happening are a 100X (which in this case would be conservative). Then it’s very simple math to conclude that, in fact, you absolutely should be buying some bitcoin. The problem we have really is just misunderstanding. It’s seen by ordinary folk as something very mysterious. In reality you could understand how the blockchain and bitcoin work in less than a couple of hours for the ordinary individual. 
My suspicion is that they don’t even realise that there actually is anything to learn. They believe that bitcoin is just numbers on a website and there’s no innovation here just stupid people paying some people money to give them a ‘bitcoin’ they can’t spend anywhere, and that the ‘website’ could just give it more infinitely or whatever.

Say, for example, there’s a real reason to raise the supply. Too many coins have been lost or miners are turning their machines off because it’s not profitable enough.

I don’t know that BTC will respect one country’s presidential election *that* well, to be honest. I think there are far too many other factors at play. It would be interesting if it became an election issue though. If it did, we’d need as many people as holders as possible.
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:12:08
I’m actually not admitting it. I’m saying that *even* if it cannot scale on chain, that does not prove that the ecosystem cannot scale. So I’m accepting that it’s possible, maybe even probable, but proving that it is not intractable to the ecosystem. 
The conclusion also DOES follow. I have not stated the stronger claim that bitcoin ecosystem has scaled. Nor have I even made the claim that it certainly can. I made the claim that inability to do so on the ledger itself does not necessitate that the ecosystem cannot scale. A much weaker claim.
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:04:17
Great video. Interesting take on the coinbase fee increases.
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:56:53
Okay, well since you’re not really interested in this space, I’ll just answer your question. You’ll have to undergo an identify verification process under most exchanges to buy your bitcoin. You then are in control of your bitcoin (it’ll sit on the exchange, but since you’re only short term, not really a problem.) From there you can send bitcoin to another address. Nothing to do with banks. There are no bitcoin banks. However, your transaction will be recorded on the bitcoin ledger for as long as that ledger exists (probably forever), so if you’re buying something illegal, I honestly recommend cash. If you buy drugs or whatever, your transaction will be stored on the blockchain. If that drug dealer’s identity and bitcoin wallet is breached, the authorities may ask exchanges about the identity of your wallet.

Well no, he owes 50% of all the bitcoin mined and IP created etc. It’s actually quite a dangerous situation for him since in reality he probably just bought some early from Mt Gox. 
The case states 550,000 bitcoin on the assumption that he was part of the team.

Completely agree with the sentiment. I bought a significant amount at 10,6 only to watch it drop to heart 9k. Didn’t phase me. That said, there’s some logic to trying to buy it at a time where you can get as much as possible. 
Whenever I buy more than a Ks worth, I like to average it in over a few days. I’ll usually FOMO one way or the other. If it drops I’ll FOMO the dip, if it rises I’ll FOMO the pump. 
Come to think of it, don’t know why I bother.

But what if it was implemented and people followed the hard fork? 
Imagine a scenario in which bitcoin is a global currency. 80 years pass and people die, not passing on their private keys, and 12,000,000 coins are deemed lost. Very dramatic scenario, but there may be legitimate reasons to change it. 
Another question, how would we implement a change of hashing algorithm if SHA-256 were to be breached?

Saying XRP is a scam is probably a bit far. It’s been around for a very long time and I have no doubt the team are trying to implement their central goal, but there’s just no great incentive to use the XRP token or any need for it to be valued higher unless they actually replace SWIFT.

Only way to describe it is I will be X bitcoins rich, where X is the number I hold and keep. I’ve made no secret of my intention to HODL 80% and sell 20% for profits. 
It also depends what kind of currency we are talking about. Is it the one and only world currency? In that case I’m extraordinarily rich. Is it one of a plethora of currencies, digital or otherwise? Then I can’t really tell you. To answer the question we’d have to categorise wealth against some kind of fairly stable asset - say a brand new Lamborghini Huracan. At the moment I would be less than 1 Huracan rich. If fiat currencies implode and disappear, with Bitcoin taking their place, I’d be several Huracans rich. 
Not a great explanation, and I know it hasn’t helped. I just wanted to introduce Huracanomics to the world.

It’s tricky to think that production cost is an indicator to spot price. If spot price increases, more people will mine, creating more competition and raising hash rate, therefore increasing the cost of producing one bitcoin. 
What could be interesting is if miners’ electricity prices rose. What would happen?
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:36:05
In my opinion CSW is totally full of shit. The only thing he might have access to is encrypted hard drives with private keys on them which he stole from someone else. The claim that he is Satoshi is really him hedging that one day he can break that encryption. Hopefully not cos he’s a bellend.

Tens of millions of dollars? 
There are other currencies out there which I think might appeal to you more. They won’t be worth tens of millions of dollars but seem to follow your ethos more closely. Notably hard forks of bitcoin. 
Be wary of the centralisation and so on, but this doesn’t seem to be a problem for you. Oh and I advise looking up what nodes provide to the network. I think misguided statements like that will win you no friends here. BSV and BCH are probably more up your street.
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:27:27
I’m inclined to agree. That’s the technical side of it, of course. The other side to it is a kind of incidental branding. The brand of bitcoin is actually quite pervasive now. I had to explain to my mother that there are not other ‘bitcoins’ but other cryptocurrencies.

@_date: 2019-10-07 10:08:29
Below... negative... 
Okay so let’s say you invest $800 or so. You have about 0.1 BTC. Now let’s say that Bitcoin price drops to $7,000. You still have 0.1 BTC, but it is now worth $700. Therefore you ‘lost’ $700. 
If it goes to $12,000 then 0.1 BTC is now worth $1200.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:36:43
Edit: the halving refers to the amount of new coins minted each day. Every time a miner solves a block he is rewarded, currently, with 12.5 BTC. That’s about to be cut in half to 6.25. This happens every 210,000 blocks, approximately four years. Since block’s are mined on average every ten minutes, this means 900 new coins per day instead of 1800. Thus, fresh supply is reduced. If demand remains this should naturally lead to price increasing.

Coinbase is fine.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:16:54
All right dude, you come across well. 
As a forex trader, I would say it presents a fairly good opportunity for you personally as you can trade using your experience, except since the volatility is so much higher, you could make some impressive gains. 
However, that’s not why we’re bullish on BTC. 
Bitcoin is a decentralised currency. What do we mean by that? That there is no central authority which accounts it, or can manipulate it. 
Bitcoin is digital. Obviously. But in a digitising world, this is important. 
Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. That allows for growth, clearly.
Bitcoin is scarce. 85% of bitcoin has already been mined. The amount produced by miners halves every 4 years. If an asset is both scarce and desired, the price increases. So as long as bitcoin sticks around, the price should increase. A twitter user named Plan B produces interesting charts looking at future price action in relation to scarcity, very long term bullish and worth you checking out. It also means bitcoin can’t be inflated to fund wars, bail out banks etc. 
Bitcoin also has a ten year history of proven exponential growth. The past doesn’t guarantee the future, but it can indicate. As a trader, if the past has no bearing on the future, you yourself know that you’d be trading blind. 
Bitcoin is not without its problems. It has challenges that must be overcome, notably some scalability issues. However, let’s weigh up a situation. You buy one BTC today for £10k. The whole thing doesn’t really catch on anymore and it goes to ‘zero’ (not actually zero, just some nominal sub-1000 value). Too bad. Alternatively, it could go to 100k next year if it repeats previous market cycles. If it follows the stock to flow model, it could end up being 1,000,000 within 6/7 years. At this point you need to do your own research and decide, is there a 10% chance it goes to 100k? If yes, its a mathematically good buy. Is there a 1% chance it goes to 1,000,000? If yes, it’s a mathematically good buy. 
Of course, you can’t *know* those percentage chances for sure, you have to just look at bitcoin for what it is and try your best guess. It’s a very similar principle to me as calling a raise in poker. You’re ahead 2/3 of the time, and the raise is 50% of the pot. *You should call.*
Hope that helps and if you have any specific questions I’ll try and answer them.

Haha they’ll change their mind as more adoption for crypto comes. If they refuse to allow deposits back into fiat but people keep putting money into crypto, they will be forced to HODL. That money will no longer be in their eco system and people will demand ways to pay with their crypto. 
This is all premised on the assumption that people keep investing in crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-15 15:40:50

So I guess my point is that not only is bitcoin in itself a peaceful revolution, but it enables the possibility of future variations of it also.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:33:53
I’m sure you’re right, just laughing to myself. All a moot point because who wouldn’t just wait 4 years and get the keys, prove you’re Satoshi, not be a dickhead, and then if you wanted to create a bitcoin fork it would likely receive adoption. If everything he has said is true, that is the obvious play.
Everything he has said stands in stark contrast to previous statements. For example, showing Andresen a signed transaction from a known Satoshi account at the start of his claim, despite that being a publicly available signature. Then later claiming he doesn’t have the keys. So clearly there is deception at both ends imo. Just a mentally ill man/someone who thought they could claim to be Satoshi and promote what was effectively just a shitty hard fork. At least Roger Ver didn’t claim he was satoshi, just wanted bigger blocks etc and probably hoped people would follow his vision. Now they haven’t he’s just trapped in it. 
What’s interesting is that Ver and Wright do have some commonalities. For example, both are deceitful bellends.

@_date: 2019-10-11 06:01:49
I think this is a little off the mark. With dividends, you bought a dividend stock. With gifts, you can refuse them. With a hard fork, it seems they want to say that if your chain has been forked you owe them tax on whatever that coin was worth when receiving it. Typically 0 as it’s not on an exchange priced yet. If it’s first exchange price, that’s bad because alts usually dump hard on listing. 
The whole thing is very weird.
@_date: 2019-10-01 08:07:44

Yes but those ‘on chain fees’ are batched which allows them to be cheaper. As I said I envisage a future of nodes running on phones in the background.

So, yes, but 12.5 halved is still a big halving. The shock of lost coins will become more felt when more people enter the space too. And hodlers.

@_date: 2019-08-09 20:22:05
Hey bro, we’re not assholes. It’s just that you don’t understand what we’re trying to achieve here. That’s not your fault entirely, but if you do some research into what bitcoin is and what it means to a lot of people, you’ll start to get it. 
I’ll explain a few of the buzzwords for you. 
Firstly, it’s a decentralised currency. What this means is that no central bank or government controls it. The bitcoin and who owns them are determined by a ledger which is distributed on thousands of computers around the internet. Nobody can alter that. Anyone can access this ledger and see which wallets have which funds. They can see transactions too. They do not know who possesses the wallets themselves. 
Secondly, it’s deflationary. What that means is that nobody can print more of it. Governments typically print money to bail out banks, fund wars and so on. Inflation actually reduces the value of a currency. It’s kind of currency stealing. Bitcoin doesn’t allow you to print money whenever you wish. The only new bitcoin created are created by miners. These miners safeguard the network. The amount produced is strictly controlled by altering the mining difficulty regularly. Every four years or so, the reward for miners is cut in half, but they are also awarded transaction fees. 
Thirdly, it’s private. It is genuinely private, however your identity can be unmasked simply by tracking which wallets are associated with which user accounts at exchanges, so don’t do anything illegal with it. 
Fourthly, it’s highly secure. Bitcoin relies on cryptography for security. It has never been hacked and if you research it enough, it’s clear that it’s *almost* impossible to do so. Frankly it’s probably most secure financial system we have. 
What are these miners? It’s complicated, but they’re effectively protecting the blockchain. They are not really mining, but ‘hashing’. This means that they take a lot of data for a block, including things like the merkle root, previous block’s header, and so on, and run that through a hashing algorithm. They are aiming to produce a new hash with a certain number of zeroes at the beginning. This is the difficulty rate (currently 18 I think - enormously difficult). If they find a hash that fits by changing the ‘nonce’ (just a digit which they add, hash, and change until a solution is found), then they publish that out to other nodes who confirm that the block is valid and has produced a hash following all of the correct rules. That is then added to the blockchain.
The reason we call it a blockCHAIN is because each block is tied to the previous one by featuring the previous block’s block header in the hash of the new block. So the blocks will be connected. What this means is that to alter something on the blockchain, you would need to also produce valid hashes for ALL of the blocks that come afterwards at a faster rate than the rest of the miners. Effectively, you would need at least half of the mining power of all of the miners to ‘shadow mine’ the blocks and then, once your chain is longer, publish it to the nodes. This is effectively impossible without having hundreds of supercomputers. 
So in short, it’s decentralised, secure, divisible, digital, stateless, deflationary, and so on. People here really believe that this is a much better form of money (objectively it is) and that it should and could be the future. I am one of those people. So when you come here with the intention of just making ‘regular’ fiat money from bitcoin, it’s a touchy subject. 
Do some research and I promise once it becomes clear this will be the most exciting thing you will discover.

Completely irrelevant on two counts. 
Firstly, he’s not Satoshi. He’s just a bloke. 
Secondly, when you release something open source and decentralise it, placing it into the hands of people, it’s what they make it. 
Bonus: it features many of the properties of a store of value. Money itself is meant to be a store of value it’s just that it doesn’t have all the properties required to be a good one.

@_date: 2019-08-04 10:02:11
Something like that. But it’s so skewed and too heavy, you know. You have these early adopting whales which distort it a little. But certainly you’d be well above the masses of normal individuals I would say, and as adoption increases, with only 21,000,000 potential coins, that will be even truer. 
Picture it like this, 18,000,000 mined approx, 4,000,000 coins lost approx. If that’s true, and let’s suppose 21,000,000 adopted and bought bitcoin, you would realistically be forced to be well within the top 1%. The only way this would not be the case is if 2,000,000 owned 2 coins each and everyone else owned less (or something like it).
Tl;dr owning one coin or more is a great place to be.

Coinbase has 5 day withdrawal restrictions anyway, which I actually think is very sensible. Surely you’d notice in that time? Or your bank could query you about it if they thought it was fraud. I don’t know, seems to me like a complicated problem they’ve put a simple solution on. Sometimes simple is best, but oftentimes not.

I mean wouldn’t that just push the problem further down the line if you wanted that lightning transaction to be settled on the bitcoin blockchain? Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:18:45
Visa processes the transactions, they are settled with banks. What I am talking about is an enlarged clearing process before a larger settlement is made on the blockchain. An aggregated settlement to merchants, if you like. 
All that really needs to be true for my argument is that the world works in such a way presently, with intermediaries processing transactions before they are settled. That is precisely what visa does. All that would need to be done in the future is an aggregation of settlement to merchants, admittedly from a third party. 
It is not the only solution. I hold out hope for lightning, but I do not view lightning as essential. If successful it will be sufficient but not necessary.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:58:02
Well, not if they accept they’re correct 55% of the time. That’s still an edge, but not enough to propel them into the proverbial stratosphere. 
There are a lot of people selling their signals groups on YouTube and I’d never go in for that at all. People like ‘crypto Kirby’ shilling every 3 minutes of a video, and only displaying their profitable tips, which could actually only be 30% of the tips they give out. 
What you have to be aware of on the other hand are people like Krown who doesn’t offer a signals group, doesn’t ask people for any money, and just shares his knowledge and openly displays his trades. He calls it ‘proof of trade’ and shows them in advance, as well as any losses he makes. I have an enormous amount of time for him.
The other side to technical analysis is because so many people are doing it, it ends up becoming a self fulfilling prophecy with the occasional �� shitting on whatever consensus is reached when volume is low.
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:18:34
Well, you reduce selling pressure from miners from a max of 1800 per day to 900 per day. That’s a real difference.
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:05:51
I said it was analogous to it. That’s what its purpose is. Of course with no payment processor people are settling directly on the blockchain and getting confused by that, thinking that the bitcoin ecosystem cannot be scaled as a result.

Hey mate, you can see the title of the video at the start of this little clip. It’s just on YouTube. Hayek is obviously an extraordinary economist and I truly believe that bitcoin is exactly what he was referring to without even knowing it.

Sell very small amounts to build a cash position. That way if the market retraces 80% you can use your cash position to buy more bitcoin. I will be exiting 20% of my position as we hit those levels. You can’t predict the top, so just sell small amounts on the way up. 
If you had a bitcoin during the last bull run, and sold 20% between 10k and 20k, you’d have built a cash position of around 3k. At the end of the bear market, that would have given you enough to buy another entire bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:35:15
Either I have drastically missed the point or you have. I think it’s you.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:49:30
Well I honestly believe the niche users would gravitate towards BTC friendly stores at first, if only to support the movement. They wouldn’t touch their HODL/investment position, but they’d convert fiat to BTC in order to spend it.

Only problem is you’re going to lose a lot of nodes. Imagine you has 1GB blocks or something. Every hour your node is downloading 6GB. Every day that’s 144gb. In a week you’d double the size of the entire blockchain as it stands now. 
So what happens? People obviously turn off their nodes. 
What else happens? Transaction fees suffer. As a user, that’s great. As a miner in the future, a few halvings down, that’s dire. 
Hope this helps.

Go on trading view and search for BTCUSD. That’s the bitcoin to dollar chart. Alternatively BTCGBP or BTCEUR. Whatever you are interested in looking at. 
Buying bitcoin can be done on a number of exchanges. Personally I recommend coinbase as I’ve used them and never had problems. You’ll need to undergo ‘KYC’. This is know your customer, and involves you proving your identity in a variety of ways. Unfortunate, but the times we live in.
If you hold a small amount you can probably leave on exchange but anything more than that I’d recommend investing in a cold storage wallet like a ledger or a trezor to keep your private keys to yourself. You’ll receive a seed phrase. Those are effectively your private keys. DO NOT LOSE THEM. If you lose them and something happens to your wallet... goodbye coins. That’s the kind of responsibility you take upon yourself. 
Any questions just ask.
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:31:28
It takes time. I honestly think it’s easier to be snappy with new people because we had to learn the hard way. Nobody handed us the understanding on a plate. But if you can hand the starter to someone, they can find the main course themselves. If they choose not to, at least they had that choice. You can’t do a lot more. Patience above all.

Looks fine to me.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:57:09
Sure, but if you’re here because you believe it’s going to 100k+ what does it matter? That being said, by the time you’ve completed KYC there will probably be a small pullback. Not financial advice, just something likely to happen. Worst case scenario it drops to 10k and you invest another €50, lower your average buy in, and don’t feel bad about it. That’s what I would do, but you can buy whenever you like.

@_date: 2019-08-31 07:13:54
I agree with almost everything you’ve said here really. 
There is one thing I have a small issue with, and that’s the tying of paper money to bitcoin. It would be neat in some respects, but the idea of doing this would really make bitcoin not much better than gold as a backing. However, whilst there are still advantages to gold, the true problem here lies in how this would be conducted. You effectively reintroduce a physical money mint, which has to be controlled by someone. And, as we saw last time, that paper money was ‘backed’, it can be subsequently ‘unbacked’ by a signed sheet of paper. 
By trying to back paper money to something we run the risk of allowing governments to creep back in and wedge themselves between the store of value and the paper, generating another fiat system down the line. 
There are more reasons this wouldn’t happen this time, but it’s not possible to say that it couldn’t, and it’s certainly worth thinking about.

Risk to reward ratio is pretty good. Do you have a stable job whereby you can afford to support yourself and rebuild that? Do you think now is a particularly excellent time to buy? Could you use half those savings and buy the rest with pay checks, minimising your exposure but getting you in the game? 
What will be harder for you to stomach? Bitcoin goes to 16k and you didn’t buy it? Bitcoin goes to 4K and you did? Are your dollars doing anything for you? 
I would recommend to anyone who understands bitcoin to buy some. Their life savings? I mean it may either be the best or worst decision of your life. For me, I ‘save’ in bitcoin these days. I’m happy with it. Bitcoin is the most exciting thing my generation has ever had, and most of them don’t even realise it yet.

I mean if there are no other currencies then there would be no currency trading, no exchange pairs, yeah. 
In that situation everyone would own bitcoin, some would just own more than others. Your employer would, say, exchange goods for bitcoin for a profit and you’d be paid in it. 
If I follow your argument and the only currency people want is bitcoin, I see no reason for any other currency. To be honest in general I see no reason for more than one currency in the world we live in. The only reason we have more than one is a) a relic of pre-globalised times and b) so that governments can control it.

Bang on. Exactly what I’m getting at. I just want to draw attention to the fact that ‘store of value’ alone should not be seen as the endgame in my opinion. Of course it may always be a property of bitcoin, but there’s greater potential to this system than just that!
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:52:13

@_date: 2019-08-13 15:40:04
Paper wallets don’t have to literally be paper. You could engrave your seed on a sheet of metal. Please do NOT take your seed to an engraver, however. If you’re going to do it, do it yourself. 
Ultimately, it’s awesome that you’re interested in this space. One thing I find peculiar, however, is your desire to ‘enter the current age’, but your total dismissal of anything that involves a computer. Please understand that bitcoin is only possible because of computers. I recommend you take a look into ledgers, and I can assure you that they are not difficult to use. You can use your phone with the ledger app. That is NOT storing your keys on your phone, the app simply knows which public keys belong to you and scans the blockchain to show you. The private keys are stored on the ledger itself. Recovery is possible with a 24 word seed phrase that the ledger will generate by itself at random. ONLY buy your Ledger from the company themselves, not off eBay. Anybody selling a ledger from eBay is almost guaranteed to be attempting to steal your coins. 
I can’t emphasise enough that you should invest the time to look into a ledger, and perhaps watch a set up tutorial on YouTube to convince yourself that it is very easy to do. The ledger is designed to be secure, moreso than your computer, and will fit more easily in your safe. If you have questions, ask away. A ledger is effectively just a mini computer designed to safeguard your keys.

I’ll be honest, I’m a fairly young guy with about 70% of my wealth in BTC. I keep cash for emergencies. I’m not that worried about being wrong. I don’t get nervous sweats when the price drops. If this all goes to shit, I’m at the start of a very stable career with a decent enough salary and few outgoings, I’ll make my life back. But if this all goes catastrophically well, I’ll have true financial freedom. 
All I would say, if you’re in a similar boat to me, is if the general thought on bitcoin at the moment is correct, and that the next 18 months should see some remarkable gains, I’d get involved sooner rather than later. That’s not financial advice, it’s philosophical and lifestyle advice.

Indeed. The thing that appeals to me about having Bitcoin as the standard and monetary sovereignty is the opportunity for civil disobedience. 
All through Europe in the early 2000s people protested against a war in Iraq. I think around 1,000,000 people protested in London. And yet war was waged. The government knew it could do and finance whatever it wished. Worst case scenario they could stealth tax to fund wars via printing cash. 
If Bitcoin were the standard, there is only one way for governments to fund projects, through consensus. You cannot confiscate my bitcoin, so you must win my consent. The power struggle between governments and people will be shifted in favour of the people, as it should always have been. The philosophical ramifications of a bitcoin standard can hardly be underestimated, and yet I think they are. This is merely one example.

You’re honestly the most annoying person in this sub. You post nothing helpful to anyone. You call people weak hands, whilst also telling them that the price is going inevitably to 2k. Then, out of nowhere, you have so much time on your hands that you drag up old comments looking for a fight. In reality, you bought the top. You’re screaming 2k because you’re scared. You are calling other people weak hands because you’re scared they’ll sell. Truth about bitcoin is that people can do what they want with it. I think you should make a new account and start afresh.
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:26:38
10x is mooning, but actually achievable imo. 100x is the absolute ceiling. 1,000x isn’t something to spend too much time considering. 10,000x is really just impossible without hyperinflation and then what’s the point?

@_date: 2019-10-06 12:21:42
No point in buying whatsoever over just buying gold. 
With bitcoin, you have the scarce asset and can verify that. With a gold backed anything, there is always a missing link of verification. For example, 100 years ago people assumed their dollar was backed by gold, but could they prove that? It seems even less secure in the hands of a private company, to be frank. So to that end I find this uninteresting. Just a spin off from an ETF, if you like. 
Bitcoin is the scarce asset which is easy to keep with you, divisible, verifiable, and so on.

I actually think you could see this ‘revolution’ but it will not be for some time. The revolution will be when bitcoin is worth far more, and fiat currencies undergo a rapid economic decline. If you’re living in a country with inflation at 10% a month and bitcoin has had 20 years of consistent growth, and by now you understand what it is, yeah you convert your money over. We are the ones taking a risk, in future people will be using bitcoin to avoid the risks.

I mean that makes no sense but ho hum.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:50:51
There is so much wrong with what you are saying. Nodes also verify that the rules of a new block have been adhered to. If there were only a couple hundred nodes it would be very easy to submit dodgy blocks or entire chains to the network.
Hashpower = security. If Bitcoin was worth 100x what it is today with no increase in decentralised hash power, aka security, it would likely be successfully attacked. The reward would outweigh the cost. So miners are essential to security as price increases. Little to no tx fees and minuscule block rewards, less for an enormous boom in price, will result in miner capitulation and serious weakening of the network. 
I don’t have time to explain every detail and I’m sure there is a legitimate argument to be made for block size increases, but not for removing the cap. Sorry.
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:48:17

See I’m not concerned about trusted third parties for payment providing. The reason being, you have an alternative and still nobody can seize your wealth.

Quite right, it’s been a while and I think if I had written that alone, I would have lost a few people without context. I will actually attempt to codify it more accurately some time later on today, with an explanation of the formal logic underneath if anyone is curious. Although very basic might be interesting to some people who have never studied logic before.

@_date: 2019-10-25 19:33:11
Hmm, lucky you. Well, I would look to buy over the counter, ie off an exchange. Buying that much on an exchange will cause slippage. Binance has an OTC desk for this purpose.
Now, if you wish to own Bitcoin, I believe this is your best bet. An alternative you could look at is buying shares in GBTC trust. 
Another way, which is the most simple, is to buy Bitcoin over an exchange. Obviously use a trusted exchange like Coinbase. Note that the amount you’d be buying, given that it would be several hundred BTC, would likely cause the price to rise a little, resulting in you getting marginally less BTC overall.

I have actually made this point several times. Ideally we are totally decentralised. However, I can envisage a world in which we are not, but have the option. That’s better than anything we have had before. You opt in to centralised areas as you think you need to. 
I see people having their own wallets and third party payment providers like Visa providing payment solutions via storing value on a card, which you can top up. 
Lightning would be far better IMO but not necessarily how the world will develop. You will still have a hard money.
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:55:21
1) what’s a larger amount? Are we talking 1 BTC or 1,0000? If closer to the former, regular exchange will do. 
2) now I’m typing this I forgot what the points numbered were. 
3) something about wallets right? Hardware wallet and back up the seed phrase as securely as possible, maybe on a cold card or something. Ledger nano X is a good shout. Don’t leave on an exchange please. 
4) totally forgotten. Good luck.

@_date: 2019-10-04 22:29:12
Understood. The gist of my advice still stands. As long as you have access to the keys, I can understand you wanting to liquidate the coins. But since you’re in such a unique situation, it’s worth you understanding what you have just inherited as much as possible. 
If anything it may help you to feel closer to whoever you lost. I’d guess if you’re broke then that’s because whoever had the coins didn’t sell them and give out cash to their loved ones. That’s probably because they thought Bitcoin had a future which would allow them to give you even more in the future. 
Again, I’m really sorry for your loss. If you do have any specific questions I might be able to help, but I might not. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:24:46
No he never claimed to be a ‘time traveller’. It was just a prediction he made by looking at charts. The further down the road you get the less accurate it might be with times. So whilst it has failed by the absolute letter, something like 16k after 250 days rather than 220 would still make the prediction very interesting.

No they don’t even exist. They are generated as a reward for miners. Whichever miner solves the block (or whichever mining pool, more realistically these days), is rewarded with 12.5BTC. The first transaction in a block is called a ‘coinbase’ transaction and adds 12.5BTC to their wallet. This is NOT sent from another wallet, but simply generated afresh. 
Imagine mining for gold except the gold wasn’t actually in the ground until you found it. Freaky huh. 
Any attempt to include more than 12.5 BTC in the coinbase transaction will result in the block being rejected by nodes, and whichever other miner provides a correct block with the correct coinbase amount will be accepted.

That’s not actually how markets work and I think this is a general confusion. To get from 10 to 20 you only need more buying pressure than selling pressure. Likewise from 20 to 40. Selling pressure is about to take a slash, so you have that metric. 
You do of course need demand, and that’s where the ‘BTC to 1000000’ by 2025 stories will help.

Where do people go when they want to learn about something new? YouTube. And where do people often discover something new? YouTube. There will be a lot of people in crypto because they clicked a random suggested video in their YouTube, heard it was ‘going to the moon’, looked into what it was and got passionate about it thereafter.

Hmm, ‘buying pressure’ is a very obscure term. You would need people to pay twice as much, yes. But that could just be the same pool of people. In fact if you had people willing to buy all the way to 100, but sellers stopped selling at 20, price would go up.

Probably right, but is it insane to think we can’t capture, say, a third of gold’s market cap? I don’t think that’s crazy.

What was the process of you inheriting it? Through a lawyer or just private keys given? 
That’s kind of nuts, but I’m really sorry for your loss, dude.
Edit: seen that this is through a lawyer. How do you have access to the coins? If you don’t have the private keys/seed phrase/sent to your wallet, you don’t currently have the coins, regardless of what the will says. 
If you have the seed phrase, buy a hardware wallet like a ledger and use the recovery mode with the seed. From there you will be able to access the coins and transfer them. If you wish to sell some or all, you can do so on an exchange. Alternatively, for a large amount like that, you may wish to sell over the counter to a private buyer. Unfortunately I’ve never had the luxury of having enough coins or cash to know how to do that. 
Just my thoughts, but this is a great time to try and learn as much as you can about bitcoin. There’s some great resources out there. I would strongly recommend you don’t sell all of your coins, but I’m obviously biased in my belief in Bitcoin. Whoever was generous enough to give you these coins obviously believed in Bitcoin too, so you may wish to try and understand what it was they believed in. 
That being said, you have written that you have been broke for a lot of your life. It’s only natural that you will want to liquidate some of the coins.

If you want to sell your bitcoin before the halving, go ahead. 
At the end of the day it’s your choice, I just personally think it’d be one you might come to immensely regret. If you’re young, you can really afford to take risks. I imagine there were people back in the day touting how Amazon or Google would be worth a fortune one day, and many people who didn’t really get the internet weren’t interested. I just wouldn’t wanna be that guy even though I have an understanding of this tech. 
For me, I’d rather take the risk and be wrong than not take the risk and be wrong.

Just kidding, someone build a fully functioning payment processing solution for these folk ASAP. I would love to see BTC act as saviour to a failing economy. It would begin to set the conditions for BTC as a failsafe. That, coupled with payment processing solutions (7tx per second is not sufficient, but neither is any block size offered by forks), is all we really need. Then just watch the dominos fall.

Mark you know I like you, but I am inclined to disagree. Depends what kind of TA we are doing. Things like Fibonacci circles, fractals, and Elliot Waves are certainly BS. However, Bitcoin really does like to play off moving averages and RSI can give you a very good indicator of price movements. Some of that is probably just self-fulfilling prophecy, but if it works, it works. 
Check out Bitcoin’s action off the weekly 21EMA for example.

Well $1 today’s purchasing power as one satoshi would not be very convenient. 
A fork to add zeroes is extremely inoffensive. It makes no difference whatsoever to anyone’s holdings or to the protocol. Probably the least controversial fork I can imagine. If you had 1 BTC, you’d still have 1BTC. You’d still have 100,000,000 sats. You’d also have 100,000,000,000 microsats (or whatever). I don’t think consensus would be difficult to roll out for something that benign.
@_date: 2019-09-14 17:24:13
No problem. Those are the kinds of things I like to look out for. In a real world it doesn’t make sense that charts could make an impact on the market, but I think the self fulfilling side is enormous. People view certain things (like weekly 21EMA) as major support, so they set buy orders there. Therefore perceived support levels become actual support in a ridiculous feedback loop. Nevertheless, if it works, it doesn’t matter why.
@_date: 2019-09-17 10:19:59

Why don’t you learn all about what bitcoin is and the problem it solves. Once you understand it and can explain your passion for it well, your parents may well be willing to fuel your enthusiasm. 
At the point you can explain the blockchain, nodes, decentralisation, fiat currency, market cycles, and so on, you’d make a persuasive case.
I’d like to think if I had a 16 year old child and they were clearly very passionate about something that I’d encourage it. Conversely, if my child came to me and said ‘I wanna buy bitcoin coz it goes up’, that I would not realistically support that.

@_date: 2019-09-13 06:43:04
Haha, if you have the $$ you can buy one from an exchange. To be clear most people don’t just buy their coins one at a time, but in smaller amounts. Each bitcoin is divisible to 100,000,000 places. Each 100,000,000th of a Bitcoin is called a satoshi. So 0.1 Bitcoin is 10,000,000 satoshis (or sats)

No idea what you’re asking. If you wet a sponge to wash your car, you cannot clean the entire car without dipping the sponge back into the bucket for some new water. 
Of course the analogy doesn’t quite work because all you really need is reduced selling pressure for BTC price to increase. Selling pressure should reduce as we close in halvening.
@_date: 2019-09-20 07:59:55
The price corrected after an enormous parabolic run up. I’m sure there is some manipulation in this market but in this case it was just a poor time to invest and a poorer time to sell. Sorry dude I know this sucks but that’s the truth.

Firstly, I think you have a very clear way of expressing yourself. I commend that. 
Secondly, whilst I like your reasoning, some of the arguments that apply against Pacal’s wager also apply to Bitcoin. For example, what if you are generally correct that there is some deity, but not the one you choose to ‘believe’ in? In this case, what if there is some system that will become a global monetary system, but it’s just not bitcoin? Food for thought. 
On the flip side, with Pascal’s wager, there is the common counter argument that belief does not equal hedging your bets. That true belief could never be simply attending a church as an insurance plan, and that believers who believed for the sake of the wager would ultimately just share the same fate as non-believers. Fortunately, that does not count against you in Bitcoin. If your plan of action is to just HODL to zero or moon, to follow that course of behaviour, it actually does not matter if you believe or not. If bitcoin does succeed, you will reap the same rewards whether you believed or not, just based on your actions. 
Just some things for you to chew on.

‘Bitcoin Is One Big Scam
Bitcoin is based entirely on speculation. Its value is simply determined by what one person thinks he can sell it for, and what another person will pay for it.
There is no asset to back it.
No matter how many bitcoin bull tell me that there is nothing to back other assets either, I will always tell them that they are not only wrong, but that is not an affirmative argument for bitcoin.
That is why I will also tell them that bitcoin is simply one big scam being perpetrated by the very believers in it. It is the closest thing to the Dutch Tulip Craze of the 1600s that we have ever seen.
So it shouldn't surprise anyone that believes in bitcoin and its potential that they should be equally invested in another ghost named Satoshi. The whole thing is so off-the-rails that even impostors are trying to gain notoriety for pretending to be him!’
Another one for the bitcoin obituary list. I can’t help but read this article and think of the author that he is kind of a loser. And his loss will be felt more and more through the march of time.

Not to be very rude but you have essentially bought the top and sold the bottom. Somewhere along the way you lost faith in Bitcoin, or perhaps never understood/believed in the first place. Very understandable IMO, it has been rough. If you can’t stomach these markets, best to avoid. If you ever regain faith, just put the coins to one side and don’t fret the small stuff.

Because you are not the only person who would likely try to access your keys. Following your logic that you would have ‘varying degrees of discomfort with any extra step...’ then you might as well just paint them in the wall, or tweet them, or email them to yourself. The advantage of something like a dictionary is that you will know that your seed is in the dictionary, but nobody else will. It’s very easy to forget a 24 word sequence and far more difficult to forget that you put your seed in a book.

Something like a deeply engraved metal sheet in an airtight container buried in your garden makes a lot of sense to me if you can be bothered. Alternatively send yourself 12 emails a year with the first and last word of each email being a phrase from your seed, one a month, first email of the month. There are a plethora of ways of doing this which is a kind of human cryptography that extends beyond simply storing 24 words somewhere - something I’m sure we’re all guilty of.

If it was just something goofy and centralised it would never be a ‘plan’ at all, just a complement to a system we already have. By drawing it out as a separate plan it gets people thinking. We have really turned the tide in public perception of bitcoin as some evil thing, now we need to convince people that this can work.

In my opinion if anyone found a the trezor card or ledger recovery sheet, they don’t even need to know what it is to get your money. A quick google search of ‘ledger recovery phrase’ or whatever will give them everything they need to know. Circled words in a dictionary, even with a number next to them, aren’t going to rouse the same suspicions.

I certainly wouldn’t invest in ‘all the coins’ unless you hate money. Bitcoin is the king, frankly. Others of interest are Monero for its privacy features, but if you don’t intend to use it then I wouldn’t bother. Ethereum is a very different project used for buildings Dapps on, so could be worth holding a little off. Litecoin has just had a halving so might have some good upside, but might not. 
In reality I have 90% of my investment in bitcoin and a little in Ethereum and others. 
To put it clearly, Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, has publicly stated you should try to own a full bitcoin before buying any Litecoin. That might not be achievable, but should tell you which coin is the king. Likewise, most development is done on Bitcoin.

If you choose to do this, there’s a 99.9% chance that you will simply lose your money, and that will be the end of the story. Your explanation wasn’t terribly clear, but I can already see where it is going.
Any time a stranger approaches me about money I immediately dismiss them.
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:25:29
None taken. My confusion was the claim that the next block is always 10 minutes away. My understanding was just that the difficulty was adjusted to produce blocks at a rate of roughly one every ten minutes in accordance with hash power. Which is correct, I believe. The claim that the next block is statistically a certain distance away is different to the claim that the next block is always ten minutes away, etc. 
Thanks for your explanation at any rate dude!

Ah cool. Yes I saw the articles! Great to see someone taking advantage of it.

Bullish on bitcoin. What we need to see is not massive prices, but people having and using it, payment solutions on top of it, and then just watch the switch flip. 
That said massive prices tend to bring more people in the market, but only for as long as the market is bullish. People need education and I truly believe that responsibility is on us.

Hey dude. For me when I was at university I would have found it very hard to watch my money be ‘wasted’. So I would say just have a serious think with yourself about whatever is the largest amount you could be comfortable with not looking at or thinking about. If you put all 2000 in and suddenly it was worth 1500, how would that affect you? 
So if it’s $500 that you think, you know, if this goes to $300 I’m not gonna be upset with myself, then I guess that’s a fine number!

Think of it as a currency conversion. It could go up or down. Do some research, don’t just buy bitcoin because it’s on your app.
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:03:09
It assumes demand. It only works if there is demand. Bitcoin cash will have roughly equal S2F, realistically moreso as fewer coins we claimed in the fork, and so theoretically if demand were irrelevant and stock to flow the only metric, then BCH and BTC would behave similarly. (Not quite as there is a smaller stock).

It would be the most benign fork ever since it really changes nothing about the architecture. You’re just adding decimal places. Imagine the dollar was suddenly so unbelievably strong that a cent would buy you two pints of milk. In that case, it would make sense to add a microcent. Would actually be more difficult in fiat with physical money, frankly. 
A $1 satoshi would be inconvenient because you wouldn’t be able to price anything lower than a sat. Think of anything that costs less than a dollar right now, it would have to cost a dollar at least. Anything that costs a $1.25 would have to cost either a dollar or two dollars. Luckily that doesn’t happen because we have ‘cents’. 
Can’t make it much simpler than that, but the idea of a one dollar sat is pretty ridiculous anyway. That puts bitcoin at today’s purchasing power of 100,000,000. That would mean exceeding global money supply by about 10X.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:09:03

I know what you’re trying to say here and I appreciate the sentiment, but the picture was the worst thing you could do. 
If this thing kicks off, and bitcoin is worth, say, 1million in the future (highly ambitious but hey), then everyone will know that the father of a child who attends/attended that primary school holds anywhere between 100k and, I guess, like 2million. Could even be more.

To stop spam attacks in the network when Bitcoin was worth very little. That is literally, literally, the exact reason he imposed the limit. It didn’t exist initially.

You’d be out of the rat race. I would dedicate my time, which is in reality the asset most important in the world, to whatever cause I saw fit. I haven’t given it too much thought because to do so would be to get too emotionally attached to a future that may not arise.
In fact, I’d go on to say that perhaps our greatest weakness as a movement, which in general terms I believe is a fair descriptor, is complacency. We have achieved so much off the backs of a few individuals, to be frank. This gives the false sense of security that we can continue in that vein. However, we must continue to push this further and not allow it to fail or be prevented by those who will expend great energy to do so.
