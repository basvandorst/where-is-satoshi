The bot searches for variations of the 8 ball syntax so it has to be called every time you'd want to ask a question.  So it'd be something like "magic 8 ball, will I have a good day tomorrow?"
In addition, it's limited by the reddit API in the number of comments it can search so sometimes a request is buried in nested comments that falls outside the capabilities imposed by the API.  So if you call the 8 ball and don't get a response, you're not being ignored, it just wasn't found via search.
