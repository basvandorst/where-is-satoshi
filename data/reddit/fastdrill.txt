It will be the same as the ADNOC IPO. It will only cover distribution aka gas stations, which make all their money selling potato chips. They won't share the truly profitable parts of the company.

KSA and UAE currencies are pegged to the dollar, so the inflation rate being worse is maybe be related to the removal of subsidies due to oil prices?

Send the BTC to a new BTC wallet.  Then use the same keys in a BCH wallet to a new BCH wallet. I wouldn't upload your wallet with both to anything BCH related until you know the BTC is safe.

How do you split your coins with A full node? It took me a while with bch, whereas it was much quicker for my brother on his ledger. I've now moved to a ledger which seems safer.

Why would Magic the Gathering Trading need circuit breakers?

I sold at $235, bought at $66 then sold at $90 convinced it would settle between $50 and $75, where I could buy more.  It then went straight up to $166 in a few days.
I think most people were expecting the price to stay down longer.  Maybe this is the bull trap though?

1) What stops someone from "pre" mining 6 blocks and then announcing them 6 in a row for a double spend attack.
2) What if pools started mining for private keys (alongside regular mining, both are SHA256 right) to BTC addresses that were known to contain coins.

How is this a DDOS?  I can still access the site without issue, it's just the trades are delayed.  Wouldn't DDOS lock up the servers preventing access?

Here is a breakdown of the specs:

* 2 GB Ram (I think PNY)
* MSI 890fx-gd70
* 1x MSI 5970
* 2x XFX 5970
* OCZ ZX1250W PSU (Modular)
* 4U Server Box (open top)
* 8 GB USB Drive Running Ubuntu with all the scripts in place to mine on startup (miners will need to be updated with latest versions though)
**Water Cooling Setup:**
* 3x EK Waterblocks with parallel bridge
* 2x DDC pumps with series top (for redundancy)
* 6x 120mm fan radiator
* 1/2" tubing

I also have bare one 5970 and one 5870 with waterblocks.

Please excuse my ignorance but please help me understand better
1. Aren't the mined answers below the target difficulty all the same for a given difficulty.  Couldn't you pre mine the answers below that difficulty and then apply them to the existing chain of blocks in rapid succession? The target difficulty does not change with each block right?
2. As the network gets more powerful, (1Ghash/s -&gt; 65 Thash/s in 2 years; what will it be in another 2 years?) BTC Guild for instance has a huge amount of hashing power.  Satoshi never envisioned mining pools, (not sure if he thought asics were a real possibility).  Couldn't a large mining pool (40% of total network) reasonably find the private key to one of the many addresses containing coins.
