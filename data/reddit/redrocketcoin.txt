European purchases on Coinbase are up 300% but Greeks can't use it because of capital controls.

It's is most certainly a scam.  You're better off buying bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:13:42
This behavior is not limited to just bitcoin companies.  Pretty much any company that doesn't have to report this type of data doesn't do it.  They don't do it because it does nothing for them while enlightening the competition.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:02:54
You're the one not thinking clearly.  None of these businesses are going to give out numbers for these types of claims because they give too much information by which their competitors can measure themselves in that given time frame.  It's not about manipulating customers, it's about stifling the competition.

Nice troll..  It's not the devs fault that some miners are sloppy.
  
The litecoin pump and dump has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin.

Dude, there has been over a dozen litecoin pump posts in the last 30 minutes.  Pay attention.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:15:41
Can you please keep this in your little anarchy sub?  This has nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with you trying to push a political point of view.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:41:55
That was actually bad wording on my part.  We wouldn't have had a hard fork because of this last patch in any scenario, we simply would have failed to soft fork to v3.
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:58:56
I hope you're right.  I want more cheap coins.

It's because the sheep have been conditioned to associate the word bitcoin with the word illegal for many years now.  Those are likely regular people saying what they think is the popular opinion.

What the fuck is this shit?

Your money is gone.

Constant litecoin pump here over the last 20 minutes!

The majority hasn't spoken in a unified voice.  We are still seeing plenty of blocks with low to zero transactions, so there is no guarantee that increasing the block size will result in fuller blocks until the underlying issues are all set, and this latest patch brought us closer.  Don't let the FUD around here get you worked up, that's some people sole intent on posting here is to get people worked up.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:49:42
Your argument is invalid because those other blockchains that you say have more utility actually don't because they pale in terms of security and distribution.  Bitcoin is the most distributed and secure blockchain on the planet.

Because nobody uses it.  And the fork during the weekend rise was a good thing, it showed us how trivial the fork is and that if you plan ahead(like any business should do), you should not be affected.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:03:23
I don't think so..
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:37:31
No, it won't.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:57:26
It's not the developers job to reach out to and notify everyone on the planet individually and ensure they understand and comply, that is an impossible job.  Anyone who's business depends on bitcoin should be keeping up with the changes and acting accordingly, like the majority of miners did!
This is the same in most tech fields, you either lead the field or you watch the leaders so you don't miss anything.

Bitcoin doesn't need to be a replacement for the global payment systems to succeed, it has already succeeded and can continue as a store of value.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:32:43
speculation happened
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:15:49
We haven't had a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:14:58


  
I stopped reading after this..  LOL
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:23:49
Nope, they were in the minority and only made the news because they happened to mine a super important block during the soft fork.  They would not have been able to maintain that long enough to mine all the blocks needed to hard fork. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:37:03
They are cockroaches that just want to troll people, they don't care.  They trolled all the way up to $1200 so this small rise is nothing.

I really wish I had bought some casascius coins back when they started.  I see the original 2011 coin go for crazy premiums.
