Um... not really. For Coinplug you have to make the deposit to their bank account as well. 
Did you mean Coinbase?

Thanks for the tips! Our design goal was to provide the simple usability of SMS wallets for email-based use as well.
Edit: Forgot to address your comment on fractional reserve: you can verify we hold all your bitcoins because we tell you your bitcoin address, which you can verify on the blockchain. Yes, this model requires trust in the hosted wallet. We'd love to find ways to eliminate the need for such trust while maintaining our goal of super-simple UX.

SPF and DKIM exist to counter such issues.

Yeah, we definitely want to make 2fa mandatory. Thanks for the comment!

All great points. We never thought of the SMS short code option, nor that specific use case to aid anonymity. Thanks!

If you can directly send mail from someone else's email account, and that account does not have two-factor authentication enabled with Payjet, then yes.

We have an error response message for insufficient funds. We'll look into it again. Thanks for the notice!!

You're right, this seems to be the simplest way (in terms of implementation, and also UX) to counter spoofing. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Right now we assign one bitcoin address per account (email address or phone number). You generate your account by sending "Create" by email or SMS.

That's a great idea, and it's on our backlog. Thanks!
