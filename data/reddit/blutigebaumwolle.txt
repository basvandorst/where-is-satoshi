Im picking your comment to respond to even though it'll be buried. The sad thing I'm seeing in these posts is everyone calling it a pyramid scheme and not even understanding the benefits of bitcoin/blockchain tech.
It's literally going to change the world..and you guys (the mass public)..think bitcoin is like trading baseball cards.
Blockchain/bitcoin is literally bringing banking to biliions of people around the world that have no banking systems. It's also letting peer to peer money exchange to anywhere in the world with NO BANKS involved. NO THIRD PARTY.
I feel bad for you people not understanding. It's literally decentralized extremely secure money that is IMPOSSIBLE to have inflation (it's actually DEFLATION which is why its going up and up). Can you say that about your regular currency? of course not.

If don't even feel bad for you. You shouldn't have stored so much money in Bitcoin in the first place. It's insecure as fuck and you should have known that.

Why do libertarians love sales taxes so much? Is it because that's the tax that fucks over poor people the most?
If capital gains taxes and income taxes are not morally justifiable in your opinion, how is a sales tax different?

But the same could be said about other taxes: you could avoid income taxes by not having an income. Or avoid capital gains taxes by not owning capital.

Instead of going to my job and earning 18€ an hour, I could spend 8 hours to dig a hole and fill it up again and then try to sell a hole-digging certificate for 144€. Just because there is a proof that work was done doesn't mean it's actually worth anything.

I don't know. So far nobody has come up with anything useful.

You're telling me venezuelans can't afford to spend 20$ on a single bitcoin transaction?

I'm sorry to tell you this, but bitcoin hit the mainstream already. There are no more greater fools left to sell your overpriced coins to.

It's still at ~8$. That's wayy too much to be useful as a currency.

Right, a wise man once said bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new paradigm of finance.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:40:16
I'm just being realistic.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:28:52
Why would you do that? It's literally the only thing bitcoin is actually useful for.
