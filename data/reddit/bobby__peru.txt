Yeah, it's like, shouldn't they just be talking about how bitcoin is going to the moon???
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:47:03
More or less true.

You are just freely applying it to Satoshi because you have no knowledge of cryptographic systems, distributed networks, or computer science in general. As people repeatedly point out to you - Satoshi's work in those spaces was not innovative. 
What he did that was clever was tie a variety of previously disparate concepts together, of course this was entirely dependent upon historical computing power as Nakamoto's concept would not have worked with computers 30 years ago.
Does that make him a genius? I don't think so - he is certainly innovative and clever.
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:19:33
I think you are preaching to the choir, and what's the point of pointing it out as misinformation if it's exactly what we'd expect from them? Kinda redundant, no?

Karpeles would be going to jail for fraud if anything
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:24:13
Yes, he offered an IRC chat in a public channel no less.
Like - they couldn't even meet in a private IRC channel?
The delusion of people posting in this subreddit is damn flabbergasting - in what sort of world do you live in where IRC is a replacement for a phone conversation?

Wow - putting aside what would be required to implement the change system wide - how trivial would it be to login to github and change a line of code?
What a fucking absolute failure of logic. The difficulty with changing the size of the bitcoin divisibility unit is that it's tied to the maximum size of a 32 bit integer which is a derivative of processor architecture. i.e. something not changing significantly anytime soon, so therefore if it was changed on the source, it'd likely be impossible to implement on clients. 
Christ man!! Aren't you a computer scientist with 20 years of experience? How could you separate the act of implementing a reference spec from changing the reference itself. I know you aren't *that* stupid, it's just a shame that you chose to be so incredibly intellectually dishonest. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:56:42
Dude - the maximum size of a 32bit integer is not in the least bit a trivial change.
Who is the poster that doesn't know what they are talking about?
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:46:00
Such are the logical fallacies inherent in a person that cannot realize what they are looking at is actually their reflection in a mirror. 
Indeed, everyone's experiences are contrary to yours and it is *them* that is making it up. Surely society is equal!

What planet do you live on that you think a Fed Reserve VP is going to analyze the U$D and claim it wasn't fairly stable.
Like - I entirely get that many people don't agree on that, but I'm not sure what sort of foolishness you are employing to come to the conclusion that the Fed would ever suggest otherwise.
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:48:03


Yeah, I read about the Duluth model. I don't think it particularly necessitates that innocent men be arrested *because* of feminism, but maybe there is some great literature that you've read that I haven't. 


That's the first sentence of wikipedia. You are aware that the late 1800s significantly predates feminism? That's my point - that in order to demonstrate your point you have to find two examples that don't even really demonstrate your point. Like does feminism somehow suggest an entirely perfect world? No, it's an attempt to bring us closer to some theoretical like that, just without a male-centric perspective that has dominated western society. You are aware other cultures are different, right? For example, the Native Americans employed a matriarchal society. Does that make them feminists? Maybe. Man haters or whatever other nonsense you seem to insist is inseparable? Doubt it. 
What is it with you and the personal attacks? 
This isn't a personal attack. This is a demonstration of your inability to grasp the most basic concept in principle here. Very seriously - did your experiences as a woman lead you to believe that they suffer no inequalities? Or did you determine that a different way?? Please do tell!


I already did this in the form of pointing out how outrageous your suggestions have been. If it's legal to pay a woman less for the same exact job *specifically because she is a woman*, then I don't think feminism has achieved much and you'd have to be pretty retarded to not see this clear example of patriarchal systems.
You don't think there is patriarchy? When we are posting on a subreddit that is for a crypto currency that people hope will crush the stranglehold of bankers on society... and you ask if patriarchy exists??? Yeah dude, those bankers are *all women* /s
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:08:30
Excuse me for not being an asshole, but if you are suggesting the practicality of bitcoin is a testament of the man's genius, then I'd think it's not a digression in the least bit. 
Like I said before, it wasn't a problem that hadn't been solved. So bitcoin functioning as it does isn't some sort of self-evident testament to the man's genius. We are going in circles here at this point, but then again - I asked you these questions a few posts back. 
Do you even understand the problem? Because there have been known solutions for quite a while, the only issue with the solutions were that they were **not practical**. And here we are with bitcoin, something that does not seem to practically solve that problem. So if you want to suggest the man is a genius for not actually solving an 'unsolved' problem - I'm going to pass.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:38:56
So what does IRC have to do with that?
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:22:37


By saying no and then paying a lawyer to do the exact same thing? AKA - exactly what Satoshi has done so far.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:25:32
So to answer the question you've been unwilling to, it's your entire lack of experience as a woman that has lead you to believe that patriarchy doesn't exist. I mean, the international system definitely isn't mostly made up as men and doesn't function as a paternal entity *at all*. yuuuuuuuup
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:17:46


So, you are trying to tell me that this guy is just a person that happens to have an incredible amount of relevant experience and *isn't* named Satoshi Nakamato?  \*snickers\* - like - what's your damn point? I'm sure they could apply to other people, but those other people aren't Japanese men named Satoshi Nakamoto who live on the west coast of the US... why do we have to go in circles here?


I've asked you to make a fucking point, not histrionically stamp your feet insisting on the intangible. 
You keep referring to these qualitative statements about her work 'barely stitched together proof', 'could apply to a greater range of individuals' but you never bother to type out a sentence to explain how that would be the case. So I don't think her proof was barely stitched together as much as your rebuttal seems to be. Shit - at least she had points!
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:44:18
I never said I was 100% certain, but it's just some damn common sense.
How many Satoshi Nakamoto's do you think exist in the world?
How many that live on the US West Coast?
How many that speak english well?
Significant tech knowledge? Interest in finance?
The Satoshi they found actually has all of that - I doubt there are many other Satoshi's out there. The fact that this Satoshi is denying is par for the course. It's not the slightest bit relevant one way or another. Saying he was this Satoshi wouldn't do any good either. 
Like - I guess it's difficult for you to accept that there isn't 100% certainty in the world, or something like that? Because you need to insist her reporting is good? No shit - she fucking found Satoshi. Like do you think this is some sort of tremendous coincidence? Which coincidence is bigger? That this Satoshi exists? Or that this Satoshi exists but isn't the Satoshi in question. 
Clearly her reporting isn't shit, if this isn't the guy it's damn close and doing whatever the people of the Internet say *isn't going to change that*.
The response you guys have had to this is disturbing. Why is it at all reasonable to be angry at this woman who is if anything trying to solve a mystery we are all invested in knowing? Because you don't agree? Then provide reasoning - back it up, argue it. USE LOGIC.
In fact - let's play a little game. Say I'm Satoshi Nakamoto. If this lady found me and I don't want to be found out, would I acknowledge it or deny her? Well - I'd obviously deny it.
Let's say I'm Satoshi and she didn't find me, but another Satoshi. Would I respond at all? Would I claim they did find me and then confuse the situation even more?
Which happened? Right - that's why I think she probably hit the nail on the head. If this isn't Satoshi then Satoshi probably isn't actually one person. The only other thing that makes sense is that bitcoin was developed by a covert group that used the name Satoshi so someone would go on a wild-goose-chase for him. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:51:36
You are a 20 years worth of experience computer sciencist with advanced knowledge of cryptography and you can't discuss the size of 32 bit integers with me and have to resort to an anecdote to back up your suggestion?
Sure dude!
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:05:57
I'm more entirely flabbergasted to see so many people insisting on what is actually logically deficient. And I can ask the same question to you considering how you are actually going around and saying personal shit about her. At least *I'm* just responding to the arguments of whether or not she, or this, makes sense.


I didn't say provable - but way to not answer **any** of the questions. 
You realize there is never going to be *any* proof, right? That it's impossible to prove that *anyone* was the individual typing under Satoshi's account and uploading code? So maybe you should rethink your perspective, because you want is impossible.
And why don't you explain how you think what she did somehow accounts for shit journalism??
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:40:05
What would those be? And how did they get there? Hellooooo?
So you think our legal system has inequalities due to feminism, but the entire concept of patriarchy is *imagined*?
Out of curiosity: where do you live? Have you been in a relationship with a woman? If so, for how long? What do women usually say to you when you describe their experiences as imaginary?
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:22:25
The only way he can talk in realtime is IRC?
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:30:27


That you are immature.


I don't think she threatened anyone, but I can see why basic facts are confusing for you.


Sure, but you are just proving her point again.


You are entitled to you beliefs, but at least she went and published her work in a national magazine. You post on reddit and *still* can't make a point that isn't full of unfounded logic. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:54:28


Ahh - so you are referring to a rehabilitation program for spousal-abusers, and some really old shit that existed before feminism. Yeah... that's real brilliant. 


And you say this because your experiences as a woman have demonstrated that?
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:54:01
Really? Where are the people using bitcoin to solve that problem?
I just see people speculating on it like a commodity. 
I don't think it's incredibly practical given that you don't see anyone relying on bitcoin to *solve* that problem in the first place. Really - a digital algorithm that takes 10 minutes to 'technically' solve, and another 5x that to be 'socially' solved (that is an actual solution because the bitcoin protocol itself doesn't solve the problem directly, it just provides a *consensus* of what the group thinks the solution is) is an incredibly novel or practical solution to that problem.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:37:46
Yeah - *that's my point!*
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:36:16
So you are saying our legal system, which is rooted in old-asse english common law, has been entirely taken over by liberal feminists yet they can't put a banker in jail?
Can you please take your bullshit to r/mensrights ?
Like, is there a fucking remotely logical way you can describe how feminism has taken over the legal system to the point where this is demonstrated by the fact that it's entirely legal to pay a woman less for the same job *because* she is a woman? Your argument doesn't pass a rhetorical sniff-test. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:24:58


Why don't you get in the loop and find my responses to that article because I've never read a dumber pile of shit.
I say this with peace and love brother - but can you only repeat back what others told you? Do you not have the ability to rationalize on your own? Because I have a hard time understanding why you'd think that article makes a good point when it's based on flawed arguments (like that it's statistically impossible for this guy to be satoshi - if that's the case, is it statistically possible that there is someone more like satoshi than newsweek's guy? or like the author's insistence that Satoshi was a more knowledgeable developer and cryptographer than what would be necessary)


Unfortunately it's public info. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:23:17
from wikipedia:


I don't think bitcoin is the result of an unprecedented leap of insight. It actually seems like a fairly timely convergence in the digital era.

While I for the most part agree with you, obviously the banks do not take law as gospel, mortgage fraud isn't exactly unheard of.
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:46:41


Support your argument or get the fuck out of here. Did you even fucking read that stupid article you linked? And you are going to insist that it provides a cohesive argument against this Satoshi? Nah! Go read my comments in response to it as left_one. Check out the post history. I'm not going to bother repeating myself otherwise.


No - she is a reporter reporting on a story.


See if I give a shit!
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:06:36


Yes, and cruise missiles. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:25:49
I'm questioning whether or not you actually bothered to read your post and see if it makes sense, because I pointed out that it doesn't.


See - that's my point.


No, that sounds like the bitcoin community's response to her because she had the nerve to try and figure out who satoshi is. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:47:55
Yes, patriarchy is only intangible! 
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:15:41
He can't prove her identity via pgp anymore than on a phonecall, he has no central authority to pull a known certificate for her from... so I don't think that point stands. And really?? Like you think she was going to ask the department of justice to sign an encryption key for her to use on IRC to talk to this guy?
I'm sure MP, like the SEC can record any phone conversation they'd want to. So it doesn't really seem to me like he offered IRC as anything other than an obvious insult to her. 
"I'd like to call you to talk about something"
"How about we stick to iMessage?" - Yeah, he is just being rude.
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:13:14
Are you saying there aren't other solutions to that problem? Or are there other solutions to that problem that don't behave *like* a currency?
Shit, is bitcoin's solution to that problem anymore practical than others?
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:09:29


He didn't say it was.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:42:19
What is novel about the cryptography applied in bitcoin??
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:15:15
Well - given that he was saying that "Satoshi" is the 'Einstein' of cryptography, you'd think he'd have done something novel.
