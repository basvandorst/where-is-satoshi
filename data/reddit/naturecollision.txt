fair enough, but with the same mindset, why not buy a fixed amount of every altcoin on coinmarketcap? because anyone of those could theoretically overtake bitcoin by some metric, and be used worldwide. the problem with ignorance (no offsense) is that it causes bad decisions and it is always worth to do some research to prevent one from making bad decisions. bitcoin is really all about facts, I am pretty sure it can survive everything except a collective and permanent state of ignorance of its users ;) so, maybe make no decision for right now but do some research, and then later, given by how you estimate mining and block propagation centralization to be an issue long term, to decide what to buy and hold :) but if your intentions are just to make a quick buck cause so many around here did in the last year/months, go for it, but you might get burned! so take care

wait roger ver lives there and he assured everyone that the funds are safe, doesn't this make him an accomplice? he has lots of btc so there would be something to squeeze, and he even lives in japan afaik.

do more research, and you will find out bitcoin can and will take away the reason of existence for 99.5% of all altcoins :)
and no, it is not wise to just buy all altcoins lol - short term maybe, but forget about it longterm - if you want to diversify, all you do is hedging against ignorance - as warren buffet states. same applies for diversifying into altcoins.

it's not about emotion, if you are the CEO of pepsi and hold more than half of your portfolio in coca-cola, even publicly condemn cocacola as inferior, you probably should not be CEO of pepsi, right? roger called bcash his project. no emotions from my side, just facts. he should put his money where his mouth is or either stfu, or gtfo. he's doing neither, it's just annoying.

@_date: 2018-01-25 08:08:19
gov'ts can't ban them, and people who need it buy thinks with it, so you don't need to het your money out, instead you skip fiat alltogether. that's the whole endgame with bitcoin. when we are ready, we don't compare to usd anymore, we will travel the world and only ask how many satoshis they want for something. many people will accept it as the most normal thing in the world, at least this is what I am in for long term.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:04:11

@_date: 2018-01-10 09:00:55
you can use bcash to make profits waiting for it to get pumped/hyped periodically, but I don't think its long term realistic value will be any other than 0. so, no it is not wise to hold both, except if you want to gamble with one of them, or with both.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:20:13

pretty sure you can not enforce your trademark on something that has been around and used for 3 years before trademarking it. it was clearly "coined" by the bitcoin whitepaper, so there's that.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:25:36
I don't think so, the radical innovation of bitcoin is not about fees, it is about decentralized money, people created the narrative that it is about the fees, but it isn't. bitcoin can and will not fail for some secondary feature kicking in too late. yes back in the days roger ver and people were mocking western union for their high fees compared to bitcoin, but technologically it was always clear that you can't scale bitcoin on-chain in a safe and decentralized way, the blockchain would grow too big too fast end you end up with 10 nodes owned by the 10 richest entities in the world, that's not decentralization, bitcoin would be attacked or taken over and it would be game over, but we would have cheap fees, great. people need to do research on what makes bitcoin so radically different and thus so crazy valuable, and they will find out low fees is not it.

everyone has a right to call their coin what they want, as we have seen with bcash. there are enough noobs in the space right now to get them worried and some might even buy some bcash. but in the long run everyone will find out why the bcash version of bitcoin is a bad idea, many in the bitcoin space already know roger ver is not to be trusted a single bit, and many will regrettably find out in the future..
there are good reasons not to be worried about any of this, but I admit the facts are rather hard to gather for newcomers.

I guess you are right there, I was just always under the impression that we only need one decentralized blockchain, and lots of beautiful onion layers behind it for different use cases, the rest are n too many. long term 144mb (estimates say this will be required to service 8billion people on 2nd layer + 1st layer) given the growth rate of the technology litecoin will surely be useful until the network can safely support bigger blocks
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:20:11
oh the boys over at r/investing already know bitcoin is not going to go away, I expect them to buy in, "just in case" it blows up, but I also kind of expect them to drop the price further before buying in. if wall st. is known for anything, then it is not to pay a fair price for anything, that's their business model in a nutshell imho :) I mean being responsible for huge financial crises and then getting bailed out is really not the fair price to pay for a major fkcup :) also, they need to get into bitcoin to have some skin in the game manipulating the markets, yes they are late, but right now the amount of uninformed people in crypto is astronomical so they will find their prey easily, but not without any exposure. but who knows, maybe they will change and for once do something reasonable: buy, hodl and help the platform to progress.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:48:24
this is good news, the wider bitcoin mining spreads over different jurisdictions the better for the protocol
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:04:42
I noticed people generally pronounce hodl wrong, the "o" is not to be pronounced like the sound the "a" makes in "aunt" makes, but the sound the "o" makes in "home" and "old" and yodel. just remember, you can hodl until you yodl.

mining the sun is the future of energy storage, imagine every household with a few solar panels dynamically using excess energy to mine bitcoin.
why buy an expensive battery for your home, when you could just use the crypto you mined from your excess solar energy, to pay for energy when you need it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:40:48
cause the only reason it retreated from 20k was that many agreed it grew too fast to these levels. now it had some breathing room, and since there is still way more demand than supply from mining, price is very likely to rise further, be it days or weeks, but I'd bet it will. it's what we call a healthy dip. trend is still intact though. other than that really just instinct an a long time in the space.

@_date: 2018-01-14 10:05:55
well I think many alts including ethereum have no future long term, many are overhyped and especially ethereum has many design flaws that inevitably lead to either centralization or to failure. since in my book, everything crypto needs to be decentralized or else equals failure, it inevitably will lead to failure. bitcoin will stay as long as it can be run in a decentralized way, and mining keeps a good level of decentralization globally. bitcoin has 1 job and it is a novel enough one, it gets it done since day 1. ethereum and so many altcoins all have 10000 jobs and can't guarantee a single one getting done in a decentralized or reliable manner. let's face it, decentralized global fair shared money system on the basis of bit-torrent and onion networks tech already IS the pinnacle of achievements in this space, the rest is hype and will come to a screeching halt long term. but hey, we'll see. guy investing 400k into ethereum below $1? cool stuff, same guy holding that shit when it bugs out and needs to fork? wtf gotta live the dream lol :D

The next rally will start, once the new money threw away their positions. when this sub is crying and screaming, and people condemning bitcoin because it didn't moon, altcoiners in total despair, when people start calling officials, complaining about bitcoin being a scam, and they make plans to regulate it, that's about when it will rise again ;) bottom line, if you are like 99% of people in the space right now, and you don't understand what makes this thing valuable, you will just sell and never make your money back.

@_date: 2018-01-24 21:39:08
yeah, again, not sure, there is a general problem with altcoins, after bitcoin was created, how can you know altcoins were not created as a get rich quick scheme? litecoin at the time did nothin special and just changed a few parameters, and you have to assume that someone will profit from it. I also heard the coin distribution is seriously shifted to a select few, but I can not confirm it unfortunately. I think if it turned out satoshi created bitcoin to make him the ruler of the world, everyone would sell. now why would anyone assume moral behaviour for altcoins? when bitcoin was invented nobody knew that it would work, when altcoins were created they knew bitcoin worked. so, if it were up to me, I would try to focus my efforts and my trust in one coin only
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:19:22
jep, he is one of the biggest holders of btc, he got rewarded with worthless bch, but he would like to sell his bch for a good price, so whats the best way to get the best value for his gifted bch coins? pump them with your influence, and dump them to people who don't know better when the price is high. let the market relax for a while then repeat. once you sold all your bch for a good price, you suddenly find arguments why bitcoin gold is the real bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:59:49
even if he sold some, if he doesn't sell all or at least 51%+ of his btc for bch, he is basically betting against his own team, thus my conclusion is, that he is merely scamming the poeple around him, making them believe in a cause he does not believe in, himself.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:44:45
just stay away from anything roger ver ever endorsed and put his hands on and you're fine long term. this includes ethereum, dash, and above all: bcash. :)
and yes they are scared shitless of lightning because if bcash won't become the "real" bitcoin, or ethereum can't cause a flippening before stumbling over its own pride again, roger and his phonies will become a laughing stock in the crypto, - and maybe in mainstream world too. that's not cool - for them.

we need to decentralize everything, we need open source hardware to run consumer electronics, and we certainly don't need facebook to become a bank and lazy people going for it. if anything we need facebook to die and be replaced by some open source decentralized counterpart.

uhm, I only had time to read the title, but I think things are going just as to be expected. the only problems we have right now are due to too many people wanting in on bitcoin. the main reasons why they, or a couple years ago, us, entered bitcoin, are still valid. fees in my opinion, are a temporary issue but some people like to pretend like it was the end of the world. I was more worried about chinese mining centralization, but things are looking brighter and brighter from there too now that china seems to limit or kind of banning chinese mining. but the FUD armies are out and they won't tell you the real good news :)
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:16:30
oh boy for these amounts and the trouble it causes the seller to re-buy bitcoins thru wiring to an exchange, and washing the cash, you need do do 20% I think. the market looks like it wants to explode to $24k right now, so anyone risking any delays in this deal might lose out not asking at least 20% margin
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:16:25
something tells me bitcoiners, even tho angry, have an understanding of the trustless nature of bitcoin, and that it is always compromised when interfacing with 3rd parties. but yeah everyone who was involved in mtgox, and/or defended it reading from a telepromter putting it on youtube, might at least be hated for as long as bitcoin thrives, and I see no good reason why that should not be the next few hundred years and more.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:45:45
a very successful trader once said if you diversify, all you do is hedging against ignorance. the better strategy is to do research and then pick very few assets with solid fundamentals, you will find out the fundamentals of ETH are totally broken and a pipe-dream, so are most of altcoins, while BTC is solid a.f. if you want to hedge crypto, maybe not against ignorance but against unknown bugs and hidden flaws, then do so with USD, stocks, and gold, but not with other cryptos. buy other cryptos if you outright want to gamble, but then you could also margin trade BTC, it nets you the same.

bitcoin does proof of work, and BFX needs to do proof of deposit. given how crazy inflated altcoin-markets are, and the fact that most altcoin-exchanges run on USDT, I would not be surprised if people started distrusting price discovery in crypto.

I want the nations of the world to peacefully compete in mining bitcoin. this would be ideal as it increases decentralization in the currently rather centralized bitcoin-mining-space.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:12:52
they don't, unless you call mass psychology manipulation. I sold a little at 20k for the mere reason it was rising too fast compared to past increases, and cause I thought maybe futures will short bitcoin, and even if there was no reason for the ladder, people still anticipated a correction, if enough people anticipate one, it will become true. it is rather hard to manipulate bitcoiners, so no centralized actor can effectively abuse or form market psychology for profit, maybe roger ver tried it, but he is failing to sell his bcash as the real bitcoin, so, meh. btc is making progress again (not more stalling pre-segwit), there is little reason to reside at 1xxxx levels for longer periods, it's not like one can wait to get a piece of the finite cake, and waiting for it to drop, let along crash, is pretty risky. I still think if everyone in the world invested what they can afford to lose, we would be beyond 100k a coin already. and given how quickly word of mouth spreads, I would not be surprised to see the price increase even quicker than we have seen, which would form an s-curve, flatten out at some point. at that time, it is still not too late to buy some, but speculation will be a smaller reason by then, and utility will be the dominant reason to buy some. right now, it is arguably mostly speculation, but on solid grounds, as utility is to be expected, and will be best in class (most secure, most decentralized and trustless)

exactly because it is supported by one after the other shitcoin bubble, creating a huge bubble network full of hopium. people sometimes say crypto is the new .com bubble, and the I tell them that either altcoins are the .com bubble, or ethereum alone constitutes for the .com bubble inside crypto. it's not like bitcoin is not delivering on it's promise, but what about ethereum? broke its promise a couple times. (DAO hack) many altcoins can't scale and they know it. bitcoin has one job and it's going pretty well thanks to the focussed effort of lots of interested developers. this is also why I got my eggs in this basket and don't bother with alts.

@_date: 2018-01-24 14:55:30
as I said, do some research, but the most obvious answer to it is that LTC, like many alts, will become rather obsolete once Lightning Network goes live and works as expected. basically the only argument (albeit not even a good one) against bitcoin the altcoin pitchers ever had was bitcoin's recent high fees, if you understand how LN works, you bet the fees will go down for bitcoin 1st and 2nd layer, and be close to 0, and stay there for a long time. what will happen then is altcoins will copy this system once proven working, and then the circle of altcoin spamming begins again. just stick with bitcoin and check altcoins for their technological inspirational value for bitcoin, not for actual monetary value.. oh I forgot, XMR with its privacy features will survive against bitcoin until bitcoin kicks in with privacy features, some of which were outlined here many times in the past. (confidential transactions is one of them)

this was a good read, thx. also very interesting that your channel partner would have an incentive to hack you, I wonder how that pans out in reality, imagine people have channels open with exchanges, this would mean they could steal funds if they hack their customers, right? but they can't really hack them if they have their coins in cold storage anyways, or did I mix something up there? I wonder how LN changes trust relationships in bitcoin, right now if we have coins on an exchange, they really are not in our control anymore, could LN change this given multisig? I wonder why we will need exchanges at all if LN finds broad adoption from merchants, or will they always be fiat/liquidity onramps? I don't like the combined power exchanges have have in the space right now, many use them like banks it seems.

in my world view, a man should get rewarded for doing the right thing. I think supporting a fair global value system is doing the right thing. needless to say, I got screwed over for being an idealist all my life, but I always believed it was due to our systems being rotten to the core, and rigged (money issuance system). watching bitcoin succeed relieves me from a lot of setbacks in the past. I would say I am in it for the tech, and on a more profound level: for the implications and change the idea behind the tech is to bring about. the money is just the confirmation that others want this to succeed too and that they get the idea as well. feels like a big community.

fair value is about $1m a coin long term imho. but only if the dollar keeps its current purchasing power and does not collapse along the way. fair value of bitcoin theoretically is the sum of all assets in a capitalist society, divided by 21.000.000, minus theoretical transaction fess to buy them. bitcoin is nothing other than a more trustable accounting system than usd, euros and other fiat moneys. it is not hard to imagine a fair value for this when everyone uses it. the current value is more or less a bet, the future value is theoretical, but the future value of apple and tesla motors is uncertain too, so meh, to the moon or to 0.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:53:01
because it is easier to just use paypal or something for small purchases instead of buying litecoin. nobody expected bitcoin to shoot up so quickly, but I will gladly load up some LN node so I can pay coffee in a decentralized manner for fractions of a cent, soon-ish.
I can wait you know, bitcoin is not just the lucky first mover, it is the most and best curated project, and has the highest prestige. I don't think the fees are damaging bitcoin, quite the contrary. if I were an absolute newcomer and would see fees of $50 I would think "damn this must be the real thing in crypto, otherwise why would people pay these fees right now"?
supply and demand, other coins increase the supply and risk losing demand as they sell out on fundamentals. I know it is hard to understand, but good luck with altcoins. Don't get me wrong, I like altcoins, for gambling and as a tech inspiration for bitcoiners, but not as competitors to be taken seriously :)

bitcoin's granularity is increasing, meaning: people are splitting up their coins to hedge for price drops, or sell for goods, so they end up with less btc as the price increases, which means: in 2 years 1 btc could easily land you in the top 1%. it all depends on whether you can hold your breath (your btc actually) longer than anyone else.

it is working, spam attacks cause high fees, it is costing the perpetrators millions a day. they have done this in a timed fashion over the last couple months, everytime bcash spiked, and them got dumped, same now, don't fall for it. if you want your transaction solidified in an immutable ledger, stored for all eternity, pay up. if you want to buy right now to have a piece of the 21mil cake that will one day serve all the people of the world via 2nd layer networks, pay up and buy higher amounts. bitcoin is a no brainer, doesn't matter the fees. wait till the bcash spam attacks fade and become too expensive, and the fee schedule relaxes again. all this will be a thing of the past once lightning and other 2nd layer solutions are ready. yes it is annoying but it is the price you have to pay when miners and a marketing clown collude to lure people into something "better" like bcash. basically it is a brand takeover attempt, and they are trying their best, maybe this time they have to try very very hard as when coinbase releases BCH deposits and people figure out it is essentially a shitcoin, it might tank to $2. so let them scare us a little before they fade into the altcoin underworlds for good.

what I'm saying is if they start messing with bitcoiners at this point, they might mess with the wrong people. theoretically they could do this, but it would probably take time, and they can't lose face. all conspiracy theorists that argue both world-wars were financed and orchestrated by banks, would suddenly get a lot of attention if they showed such an amount of control and power. do you know what it needs to ban every participant in the legacy financial network from accessing bitcoin? it is hard to imagine, but if they pull it off it would be at a super high cost. you need to think long term my friend :)
I mean think about it, is there an entity that can make even small private banks fall in line in regards to bitcoin policy? if that would happen, all the brainwashed intellectuals of the world, not seeing the monster we allowed to form, would suddenly see it. it would be a disaster. no idea if they pull it off, but I know they are scared about bitcoin. have you seen the recent bank of canada speech? trying to find the link, give me some time, damn can't find it, someone help me out, might have been a guy from rbc too, he was worried about it in some interview or press speech.

personally I have to disagree with 3), as I prefer exchanges that settle in BTC, I have no interest in speculation by futures, sure let the big guys have their fun pumping and dumping, trying to impress everyone else, except they won't. not you keys not your bitcoin. maybe they can somehow try to short bitcoin to levels where holders can't afford to hold anymore. idk, this futures trading impact seems overrated. there is no real bitcoin involved so why bother. a pure speculation tool.

before you to to sleep everyday consider this: there will never be more than 21mil coins globally. and the network will very very likely not be hacked in the next 20years at least. there has never ever been anything so reliable like bitcoin, and people do rely on it, the tech works and works. if it goes to 5k buy more, if it manages to go to 2k buy a LOT more. people make money in this by buying low and hodling. gambling and selling while trying to guess tops and bottoms makes poeple lose money because there is already manipulation happening, coinbase clearly was part of it recently. bottom line: as long as bitcoin works (technically) it must rise in value as it has no competition. and yes I believe altcoins are no competition, as bitcoin is the prestige project and aggregates the best heads in cryptography to make it work in the most reliable and responsible way possible, as if lives depended on it. altcoins don't have this attraction. this, and the current state make bitcoin valuable, almost exclusively. the only thing that gives fiat currency value is plain and simple violence, but that's another story that goes too far right here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:53:54
no it's not, if you invest 2% of your salary for the rest of your live you might reach either 0.1 or 1 bitcoin eventually. or you get lucky and some exchange implodes, or trump bans bitcoin, or china, or china and trump, or china trump and jamie dimon ban bitcoin :D idk what could cause the price to drop, but to get more bitcoins cheap you need a lower price, then you can reach 0.1 or 1 or maybe even 10 bitcoins.

yes it is, the bcash fanboys gather up periodically to orchestrate a bcash pump, this time it happened around a difficulty readjustment if I am not mistaken, and then they sell into the peasants dumb enough buying it. now while there certainly is no excuse for not understanding what makes bitcoin valuable (in comparison to bcash) there is also little excuses for taking money of the masses of uniformed people, who all just want a piece of the future money cake. and if you understand blockchains and POW well, you will find out there is little use for alt-coins, as they all just try to reinvent the wheel which is bitcoin. I was thinking about buying bcash when it drops 5x again and then to just profit from the next pump, but then, any satoshi I add to that silly fork, is one too much, even with speculation in mind. I prefer to just ignore then and inform others about their scam, bcash is not a responsible crypto project, not at all.

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:18:09
yes the idea is thinkable, but in reality many would have sounded the alarm bells, also, adam back is part of it, and he is really trusted in the crypto world. if you want to come up with original conspiracy theories, why not start at the start and assume satoshi was a cia guy, it is possible too, right? my point is, many things are possible, but many things are not worth to take into actual consideration or spent too much thought on it, or you get crazy. you know, it is possible I get hit by a car tomorrow, should I bother thinking about it every day? no. if there were solid enough evidence that something fishy is going on with bitcoin core developers, which btw is not even a solid group but free participation of contributors, then it would have made waves in the scene, whales would have investigated and sold. but yeah, anything is possible, I agree.
as for the financial system with 100% control, I agree too, it is inevitable long term. also I might add decentralization of many things will be a trigger word in the next future for many people. centralization might soon be a thing of the past for many things. maybe it will even swap over to parenting, kids not being indoctrinated by the head of the family anymore, but educating and weighing in facts from all kinds of sources. I think kids of the future won't be very susceptible to charismatic leaders anymore, hopefully we see a future where dictatorships are not possible anymore - a new enlightenment? hope so! sound money is definitely a good step towards betterment in many spaces.
blockstream addendum: look, adam back and blockstream give nobody any reason to distrust them. the crazy theories and accusations I heard about them over at that other subreddit were all baseless upon closer inspection, and apart from that incredibly insulting. if anything I respect those guys to keep their cool and just do what they do best, code for bitcoin and make sure it runs smooth and faster every release, while everyone goes crazy about the price, so many seem to forget where that price is coming from. we would not be in such a "hype" or as many call it "bubble" if bitcoin had crashed a couple times or needed constant rollbacks or dev intervention. anyways, I think they are doing a solid job, and since you can't find many good cryptographers in software dev world, I am also kind of grateful they do this job - but thankfully I don't have to be thankful as their incentives align with most others in bitcoin, and that's a good thing. actually, the best thing about bitcoin is how the incentives are laid out. everyone trying to screw with it has to pay a lot of money (too much money) to effectively do so it seems.

no offense but do more research what exactly makes bitcoin valuable. hint: low fees are not prioritized because they are secondary to the nature of bitcoin, even if some roger ver clown will tell you otherwise. but roger ver completely misses the point about bitcoin, and has done so as long as I know him.
that being said, lower fees will become a reality with bitcoin gradually with segwit adoption and then with lightning implementation. the bcash trolls will tell you "we can't wait that long" is because they want to make money off you. bitcoin core project does not want to make money off you, they want to give people an alternative to the legacy banking system, and bcash can and would absolutely not do that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:40:43
take this trick of my trick-textbook: if you have spare fiat right now, set up cascaded buy orders down to price X whereby X is the lowest price you can think it could go. so you will be buying at equal intervals down to X, and when you see the trend changing to bullish again, cancel all buy orders and buy spot. I did that during the 2014 bear market with great success.

think about this, once btc/gld markets become more widespread, they will lose the grip on gold markets.

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:36:44
well there are many explanations, I recommend you do some research to find a good one. of course I won't leave you empty handed and will present you a logical, profound and short one:
marketing! if you hear a lot of people marketing their coin and bashing other coins, it almost always automatically means their coin is rubbish, as they use force, money, and attention to promote their product. economics tells you every product that needs lots of promotion, explanation and convincing (aka energy) to be successful, is flawed. bcash is flawed for many reasons, but merely by how vocal its self proclaimed leader (roger ver) is about it, shows you it is a turd. everything good needs no promotion, the product speaks for itself. I think bitcoin would not have needed roger ver at all. it is like hiring a salesman for something that sells itself: a waste of time. but roger has a big ego and has some personality issues, that's why he started to create something new, trying to get what he seems to need most: recognition. but yeah, I already said the details are more intricate. there were some disagreements in the past about how to scale bitcoin, there is one camp that came up with a quick n dirty solution, and the other camp with a more sophisticated solution. turns out bitcoin is going for the more engineering wise elegant and imho only reasonable solution, and bcash went for lets raise the block size and see what happened. needless to say nobody wants to use bcash, as nobody trusts their nodes, their lower hashing power and their 1 man dev team. and nobody trusts roger ver, and some even hate him for backing mtgox and mark karpeles back in the days. anyways, bcash will maybe not die all too soon, but I am sure either roger or his fanclub, or some miners spend a good amount of money artificially trying to keep that DOA alive. I hope this answers part of your question. for newcomers it is rather hard to see through all the BS on this matter. bottom line really is that bitcoin devs are doing a responsible job in this highly delicate matter (keeping a network up and working 24/7 for almost 10 years straight now, with billions and soon to be trillions on the line. and then some clown comes around and says he knows what bitcoin was supposed to be, give me a fkn brake :)
bottom line of the bottom line: bitcoin development better be a thing for engineers, not for some marketing guy do have a say in. bitcoin keeps many of the best engineers in the space constantly busy. and it is really reassuring and this is why we see prices beyond 10k and soonish beyond 50k, 70k, maybe 100k...
also: scaling and low fees, even if promoted as oh so important, are not the main value proposition of bitcoin. bitcoin is also not competing with visa. if you want to know what bitcoin is competing with, and what it's main purpose it, do some digging, and see how deep the rabbit hole takes you :)

well just no, it would expose the banking system as one entity and then the real messy fight begins, bitcoin might go underground again. if anything, bitcoin holders, which become more and more every day, will have enough skin in the game to tell the banks what to do and what not to do, and thus reset the balance of power in the world again. right now we have a clan of central bankers essentially dictating policies and extorting governments with liquidity threats. officially it is all to balance the markets but this is BS. really it is because banks are too big to fail  and governments have no other options, than to listen to what 'system relevant banks' dictate. it is bad, and it caused a lot of wars and suffering in the past, I even expect both sides on the war on terror to be played by said banks. bitcoin has the best chance on bringing what political campaigning only taunts us with: change
that being said, even if the ride gets bumpy, and the banks get forced to show their hands / or their real face and intentions, the only way they can get effective influence over bitcoin long term is by buying into it. I know doing a honest thing and just buying into what is valuable is not how banks do business, so I expect them to try to lower the price by manipulation, legislation and every other dirty trick in the book there is, to buy cheap. this is why hodling makes a lot of sense, but it is also nerve wrecking. if anything, be prepared to get vocal and active for your right to a free decentralized money, it should be a human right. fck the banks. bitcoin is as valuable as you enforce it to be, don't let them scare you.

well, I just donated a smallish % of my net-worth to this guy, after all he is one of the bigger reasons why my initial investment in bitcoin multiplied by several orders of magnitude .this guy should not be worrying about money ever again. let's show him bitcoin community is not a club of greedy nerds and egocentrics, but if anything, a conglomerate of deep pocket, benevolent philanthropes, knowing exactly where it makes sense to throw money at, and trying to make the world a fairer place to live and do business in.
edit: I was thinking, wouldn't it be a noble eternally remembered move if roger ver, the reason for andreas' questioning of his (financial) decisions, would donate 0.01% of his net-worth to andreas? it would not hurt roger, and likely would not require andreas to ever fly 2nd class again ;) one thing for sure, roger spending 0.01% (or maybe even 0.1%) of his net-worth would be one of the smartest moves that guy could make right now, image-wise :)

I am more thinking long term, when you don't sell bitcoin anymore, you just buy goods and services with it, stream money to your employees and get paid. in 1-2 years it should be technically possible. thats a super small timeframe, and the only way to get hold of as much bitcoin as possible is to either buy early and hodl or fud people into good trades (for you that is)
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:49:14
no, I guess my wording was off, what I meant to say is that low fees are not necessarily a sign of a quality project. there are many means by how a payment network or coin can achieve low fees, it just happens that most of them get used so little that it makes their fees so low. if they got used more, the fees would rise and some project run into way bigger problems than bitcoin if the demand were as high. my case is simple: bitcoin has the best and most efficient engineering for its purpose, most other projects I checked out are flawed left and right, some have lower fees, yes, but they lack other properties. take ethereum, lower fees, clumsy blockchain, fails left and right when you use it as the recent game that got played on it showed. not interested. all I care for is the replacement of banks and move finance into private individual's hands and have it protected in a decentralized manner. no crypto project does exactly this better than bitcoin, and I have my bets on this staying this way. no fee in the world can and will change this. but if you dig a little, you will find where low fee spam transactions come, and you will find miners that transact to themselves, effectively paying fees to themselves and making everyone else pay higher fees while doing so. nobody is talking about that it seems. but yes it is a complex matter, to me it looks like a periodic attack, and it looks that way because you lots of shilling and pumping of bcash periodically, perfectly aligning with some of the things I mentioned. but this is nothing new, this has been happening even before there was bcash. back then it was to discourage segwit adoption, I guess part of it is because of politics and a few bitcoin related companies having a business model that relies on on chain solutions, so of course they need a on chain scaled bitcoin asap, and they might or might not rally for this, even if it is nonsense from an engineering perspective.

I don't think it is a thing of beliefs, I think bigger blocks cause more problems than they solve, mining is centralized already and bigger block make the problem worse. in a way bitcoin is too big to mess with how it is right now already, it is a gold shitting cow and even if there would be technical reasons on why to even reduce the blocksize, as pointed out by lukejr, you can't get this through cause you kind of can't change bitcoin anymore. even segwit got delayed a LOT and would not have gone through without broad community support. I believe 8MB blocks in a rushed fork, let alone on bitcoin itself, achieves short term relief and long term fiasco. bitcoin would end up in the hands of a few and miners would be able to inflate the fee market even further, as bigger blocks means potentially more fees if you spam transactions like they do everytime they want to push the bcash agenda. (everytime the fud and fee spammers start on r/bitcoin you will also see some difficulty change and the whole thing just looks like a planned pump&amp;dump at the cost of novice investors). anyways, I am highly against a rush to bigger blocks, and I am patient enough to wait for a stable enough implementation if 2nd layer networks like lightning.
the conspiracy theory you mentioned holds no water unless governments on the world collude to ban cash and go 100% digital with all currencies, but in that case bcash would be as screwed, maybe even more screwed than bitcoin, as very few would run bcash nodes with crazy high blocks-spaces.
anyways, the core team and devs around the bitcoin project have done a stellar job so far, and there is no good reason to change teams because of growth pains. I'd rather be a millionaire on a well crafted ship in 2 years, than right now on a bamboo raft. tbh.
but yeah opinions diverge on this and have been for some time. - I really like the "better safe then sorry" approach of bitcoin core though than the crazy conspiracy theories spewing out of the bcash camp.

I often laughed about hodler-mentality, as I argued, 'if you don't understand bitcoin, and just blindly hodl, you must be stupid'. now that I understand that this thing is nothing other than a super secure accounting system with its own tokens, just like seashells, hodling makes a lot of sense cause all it does is reassure that eveyone else who uses seashells considers them as valuable. now seashells are forgeable so they are not quite fit to be used to blindly hodl, but bitcoin is, thus hodl is all right. all hodl does is reassure each other that what we hodl is valuable, all except jamie dimon, but we don't want jamie to have any say in our cozy seashell business, unless he buys some ;) correct me if my analogy lacks.

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:57:32
people attribute a lot of values to bitcoin, but what many fail to mention is that bitcoin is merely an accounting system, there is nothing to it except that you can not afford to change the blockchain. bitcoin's implementation and security is the best and this makes it the most valuable. yes you can transact too, but on the 1st layer it is super inefficient to transact, but this inefficiency serves a very important purpose and is NOT an oversight. so I would say it is a store of value with kinda limited possibility of transacting for commerce, or let's say it is limited in a way that the inefficiencies become really big the more users want to transact at the same time. the best solution to deal with this is 2nd layer networks that are linked to bitcoin and thus as trustless as bitcoin itself. this is rather complex and takes time. bitcoin will not die not get taken over because it grows too fast, that is a myth the bcash camp wants to sell you. the way I see it: bitcoin is digital gold, immutable and unforgeable, on top of it we will see something like derivatives that will be traded like fiat - but backed by gold (bitcoin) - except you can not inflate the supply of the derivatives, which is something the legacy financial system failed on. legacy system just declared the USD as not being backed by gold anymore with nixon if I am correct - this can't happen for bitcoin. all this takes time, and if we rush it, we could mess it up. now roger ver is a cry baby that wants a lolly RIGHT NOW and this is why he fuds everyone into believing his shitcoin is the real bitcoin. don't fall for it. keep calm, hodl, and if it drops buy more so you can have a bigger piece of the 21mil bitcoin cake when the day to stream money comes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:40
yes, but it really depends on what people think bitcoin is and what makes it valuable. lots of new faces in the space, many think the high fee situation is a genuine problem and know little background to it, so they think it is a real problem with bitcoin, as it it looks so simple, just like the blocksize. damn when I think about it, couple months ago I was a big blocker too and my reasoning: there can't possibly be anything wrong about simply raising the blocksize, I feel dirty for being so stupid, and when I researched more I found out what exactly bitcoin development tries to achieve and what is the most important thing about bitcoin. now if you want me to tell you: I won't. go the extra mile and find out even if it takes you a year, it is so worth it - welcome fellow newbs :)

he assumes that at one point after those who got in 3rd 4th and so on, it will be widely accepted and volatility drops, which is just one of the many assumptions he makes. what is more likely, is that if we go this way, which requires hype and group think, we'll drop like a stone once we plateau. constant price increases are impossible to be held sustainably when the main motivation behind the rise is hype and greed instead of substance. but at least he mentions 5yrs timeframe and not investing more then you are willing to lose. but I would add: if you are willing to invest, ask yourself about your motivations. is your main motivation greed and profit, or do you understand the ecosystem, the tech and deeper implications of all this? if you don't, then don't even invest what you are willing to lose, as you most likely will lose it anyways. bold claim I know, so, why? cause mass ignorance as a basement for price increases, or value increases in general, have never in history lead to something sustainable, bitcoin and/or crypto will be no exception to this. imho volatility will be gone once speculators, centralized trading platforms and hype-cycles are gone and people use this person to person in real commerce. might as well be a pipe dream of mine, but we'll see.

I started to get very critical about it when I found out that someone close to me couple years ago begged me for money as he was 'struggling' and recently I found out he bought bitcoin with it, and stores it on coinbase, I told him wtf, but it is just that, stupid, he has just as much no clue about any of this as prolly 90% in this sub these days, I am generally recommending never to invest more than you are willing to lose, which many do as well, but I also recommend to never hodl more than you are willing to lose. I have some btc myself but I don't partake in hyping up the price, also I don't short bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:48:12
since inception of this, everyone always invested with the idea of making gains, nobody ever disinvested to make sure they stop losses. once we go there though, the ppl who are so cool now might get very sweaty, and even before the panic selling kicks in, the remorse of not having sold while you were in 10x or 100x profit kicks in. this could become a chain reaction. we never had it happen cause the upside was so big, but now that everyone heard about bitcoin and crypto, and we reached peak idiocy with altcoin hype and ethereum spammers, faketoshi and whatnot, maybe it's time for parabolic drops lol :D from "hodl" to "sodl", from "buy the dip" to "sell the deadcatbounce".

this is mathematically impossible, unfortunately. you can come up with any shitcoin, hype the shit out of it, spam people like me (happened) on reddit to buy into ethereum ICO, and there you go, ethereum started from below $1 if I am correct, many other shitcoins start from zero, there is way more upside from a new coin than from the most established coin, this is what fueled the ICO hype and altcoin craze of 2017, they all made more gains than bitcoin, of course many of them, as many predicted will outright die and be forgotten in 2-3 years while bitcoin, (if it survives the big escape), will be still around and chugging along - of course this is all based on data from the last bull-run, which was obviously fueled by altcoin-hype, it went as far as altcoiners attacking bitcoin trying to outcompete it for their cheap gainz. on my best case scenario, the next bull-run, or whatever prosper period bitcoin might see, will not be fueled by altcoins or magic ICOs, but something more real.

jep but with LN, supply will not be limited anymore, as currency velocity will increase dramatically, I am no financial expert but I learned if velocity of a currency increases, it puts pressure on the price, as demand for actual coins drops. with 100 bitcoins tied up in the LN network, it could do 99.9% of all daily transactions and the other 20999900 bitcoins would not be needed anymore. again I am not an expert, just picked this up somewhere.

@_date: 2018-08-15 15:19:03
my point, I guess, is merely that it isn’t that wildly different than fiat, if it is being used with the same level of convenience as fiat. revolutionary new currency, private money, censorship resistant money, while someone else holds it for me? man, you almost got me sold there, but what you are saying is a contradiction to everything that makes or made bitcoin valuable.

nope, I'm implying it doesn't need that much of a drop for people to get sweaty, bitcoin is so experimental and really nothing is guaranteed, that it makes you sweaty no matter what. sure there are people as cool as the guys in the roller coaster, but that's people who have other solid incomes and see their bitcoin investment as disposable anyways. but what about all ppl who dollar cost average expecting this experiment not to fail? personally I don't know about the future of any of this, I just know if you can walk away with a profit out of this, do it, if you walk away with a lambo out of this, you're lucky. everything else is explained by a host of theories around speculations and maybe self fulfilling prophecy-theory. of course anyone can speculate on this and buy as much as they want, even more than they can afford to lose, but in that case, they will need to expect the price to rise from here, and to do this, they look at the charts and see that bitcoin has always recovered so far. so it must recover again, right? well, no. absolutely not, as past performance does not warrant future performance. if anything, you need to use your brain to find out whether bitcoin is over or undervalued, or valued just right. some price won't go lower as it costs miners to produce one bitcoin, but this does not apply if the smart ppl and big holders in the space start thinking something is rotten, either with miner centralization, or some other kind of centralization or market fraud. one other good indicator of overvaluation of this new asset, is if people are fixated on it's dollar equivalent price, and keep pushing out price increasing mantras, instead of necessary uncomfortable discussions, about whether tether is backed or a good thing to have in this space. so if focus on price is still high, or too high in your opinion, then price is probably artificially inflated or plain too high. there are a host of issues and features of all of crypto, which have no place in the sidebar of this sub for example, but are not regularly discussed in forums either, personally I will get bullish again, once bitcoin's biggest fundamental issues are discussed in the open, and the results of these discussions pinned or linked to easily consumed by visitors.

I think the admin thing you mentioned is more plausible than the hacking thing...you can't really immagine any account by the real satoshi being hacked? that would be too much of irony for a very smart man. I still think it's the real one though, and if he is as smart as I think he is, this was the right thing to do, newsweek is really fucked, all this might be another punch in the face of mainstream streamlined propaganda media. bitcoin was the first, snowden the second, and now this, what do you think it this?

you are right! and it will become true, unless WW3
and if you look closely what the media and political cartel are doing in germany right now - nothing short of warmongering vs russia - then you start thinking they want to use europe to have a war vs. russia...
either way, bitcoin will skyrocket with any crisis because people will distrust the current system, and given current systems and problems are all deeply rooted in monetary flaws, this is the only reasonable thing to assume.
all this of course, unless ww3, meaning nuclear worst case, and then order out of chaos, planned by the evil fuckers who control europe since 300 years, and now Britain and the US too.

if you ask me, the whole story of newsweek was made up, meaning, paid reporter, paid dorian, and why all this? read the recent documents leaked by snowden, in one word: deception. real satoshi could not allow that even though he risks being found, who knows what nsa would like to do with real satoshi, and I think that's why he kept it so brief, and I am sure he logged into that account via anonymizing services like tor and such..
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:56:31
well maybe he doesn't give a fuck? do you think he feels anyhow obliged to prove anything? I mean he is satoshi fucking nakamoto! and the nsa is probably after his bitcoins! so he better be as brief and careful as possible while also clearing up that this dorian thing was a rigged media scam, like all those scams before, 911 iraq war, taliban bin laden and now ukraine, they have an agenda and it is agains bitcoin. so trust me, he does not need to prove us anything, nor should he, he'd better be VERY careful, and he is being careful. ok?

we need to focus on the hard facts, first of all: nodes will be wrecked even just with little increases. we need to show and prove that 2nd layer solutions are no threat to the core values of Bitcoin. then even large blockers will be convinced eventually. also we need to show the incentive structure for miners in the core scenario. we don't need to give in to politics, or slander. if hard facts are presented and hit the top of r/Bitcoin over the next months, segwit will activate, people will come to reason. as much as I'd like a simples block increase solution, in reality it is a little utopian. what we need aswell are projections over what will happen with the segwit change, I mean very detailed scenarios must be drawn, nobody will swallow this pill unwell he knows exactly what it does..
so far, someone like me would wish for more detailed information on how safe segwit is, how it will affect Bitcoin, maybe how it affects the fee market, what happens to on chain transactions, will they be super expensive, if so, is that bad or not? 
we need a vision and projections, without it, no future.

@_date: 2017-02-24 06:41:57
the tangible asset that gave your money value was gone even before you bought bitcoin since the abolishment of the bretton woods standard, thus it is easy to exchange worthless fiat for bitcoin - the irony is, that we live in a world where money only has value if we believe in it, and now there comes this hard digital asset around - that btw can't be confiscated by governments like gold has been in the past - and all this happens while the powers that be are scrambling, the neocons are totally screwed and losing power, trump, that the imperator purple dressed clinton was shocked to see win, is no neocon, and thus they are crumbling hard
so maybe I should reconsider my warning of a 40% fallback from $10k in case of a pending hype phase similar to Nov13 from my prior post...maybe the correction will be more like 20%
that being said, never invest more than you can afford to lose! bitcoin, while being a genius' play, is still experimental and will stay that way - but given what I expressed in this post I might aswell advice to invest what you are willing to accept as having lost already and hope to gain something out of nothing :/ - cause if you ask me, the values that are reflected in fiat money, i.e. the corrupt systems we built upon it, are not something I want to support by keeping on using their money, but I still have to some extend, at least until bitcoin will find a way to scale so that the conspiracy theories of r/btc are being debased, right now I would buy segwit and lightning, if one could prove to me that opening lighning channels and closing them requires blockchain confirmation/action, thus being rooted in the blockchain itself. if this is the case, then we should just do this (segwit, etc...) but if there are doubts, they need to be discussed in detail.

+1 for modest enough enough increase without any bells and whistles. Bitcoin the Network, and bitcoin the money is doing just fine and well (at least from my experience as an end user), and we all know the simple truth to anything IT: "never change a running system", so again: 1+ for a modest enough change to the system: 2MB blocks and nothing else please. at least for now. we can talk in the future about other necessary changes. for anything uneccesarry and experimental, for anything based on opinions and speculation about future and not actual needs, there's something called altcoins. That being said, I hope things like censoring and power freaks have less power in the future, so, less power to power grab and centralized censoring: isn't that the spirit of Bitcoin after all? lets go guys.

thanks for the hint, but I am quite ok with losing fiat in the rather unlikely event that bitcoin somehow failed...I am in this because of principle, not for personal gains. If all people of the world acted like this, there would be no money out of thin air. so to speak, I trust math more than people. we elect people to do the right thing for the people, but they don't and if pizzagate is true, they are super perverted degenerates, I'll take the risk to lose their money, it's not mine anyways, hasn't been since bretton woods :) they've manipulated the shit out of the goldprice, the techniques used created a super inflated derivative market, and it will come crushing down - I have set my bets that the USD will hit 0 sat before bitcoin hits $0 - if that happens, the cards are reshuffled and we might advance as a culture instead on being artificially kept in stagnation mode---remember y2k? remember what everyone felt back then, and then the suckers orchestrated 911...well they are done soon, ok rant off now :) all good enjoy the ride folks

unfortunately not everyone, as I mentioned in a past post, I fell for it initially too. I have to admit my computer knowledge is limited to assembling them and maybe crimping my own network cables ;) so the seemingly simple idea of removing the blocksize limit seemed very reasonable, and 'graspable', but upon closer inspection the sub is full or altcoin shills, antibitcoiners and dare I say it, deluded people, and I was partly one of them. the conspiracy theories are unsubstantial, the scaling propositions naive, and the general tone toxic and agressive, and now we have proof of shilling, I am done with that sub. to all newcomers: these people probably want to hurt bitcoin, there was a wave of ethereum messages going on reddit, trying to convince people ethereum is better and such, look what happened, they forked!
stay strong, go levelheaded and go with the tech, then bitcoin will do great as great as it is doing right now.

to defend gold: you can make solid gold dildo out of it and screw yourself, so there's that
but seriously, I like gold, it has always been money, I just don't like how easily a government can confiscate it - smash your door, metal detectors, and there goes your stash, even if hidden in solid concrete walls...
it's quite fascinating that a government can steal or confiscate bitcoin less than it can steal gold or any other valuables. basically what it comes down to, they can not prove you got a 24 (or 12) word seed in your head with which you can basically access your stash anywhere in the world - this is not just gentlemen, this is a revolution - and all this cause of math and very talented and visionary programmers, damn, neo is real :) hail math I'd say, hopefully bitcoin will end all ideology, then zizek might finally be happy ;)

I would not be surprised if he was actually Japanese. Japan to become a big player in Bitcoin soon too, I hope the tptb don't unleash another tsunami over them..

It really made me super suspicious too that this guy called bitcoin a fail. and goes to work for private blockchains, wtf. meanwhile ppl at r/btc are guessing this was a move to shake up people to accept a hard fork, something I am not sure anymore is a good idea unless I get to see an unbiased research on this issue. your post is nice dude, but explain to me, why is a block size increase NOT simple? bandwith grows, processing power grows, why not the blocksize? what exactly will happen if we just do it?
explain to the poeple out there in simple terms why we don't just increase the blocksize to 2mb!

guys, if you complain about the price, you definitely invested too much. don't do that. bitcoin is not and will never be a get rich quick-train, but since bitcoin was invented before greed in humans was eradicated, we will continue to see huge swings

I got my buy orders set down to 32$ a coin, I could not care less about price, one thing is for sure though, 32 bucks a coin would be cheap as fuck and super undervalued at this point in btc development 
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:55:09
could not agree more, what this guy misses is simpleythe fact that a block size increase is neither simple nor straightforward. if the number of nodes scales downwards with the increase of blocks, it would be devastation. Bitcoin relies on the nodes, and there being many thousands of them is something that can not, must not change. by sticking to small blocks, core is doing Bitcoin a favor. there is no conspiracy and no political reason behind it, just technology and a few minds that have a sense for the bigger picture. now can we continue to focus on technology to finally show everyone segwit is safe, and the best solution?

pretty sure ETF has not much impact on this price at all, it is more likely demand and education about financial alternatives is steadily rising globally...we have national premiums up to $500 per Bitcoin, ppl are scrambling to get in, get ready for $1500, and $2000+ in a rather short time..if no ETF expect a $200 drop, not more, it is overestimated compared to current global Bitcoin attention and adoption developments imho - there are good chances China's officials will embrace Bitcoin, and Indians are at the verge of realizing Bitcoin is digital gold, you know Indian's relationships to gold, don't you? ;) oh and just a reminder, if you want to figure out Bitcoin, don't think about the price too much, it is just a necessary result of the tech, think more about the habitat it has been put into, makes more sense, the more I learn about how Bitcoin works and behaves under special conditions, the more I learn about the world we live in ;)
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:17:48
In my case: 3 years. tell you my story, ppl on german 3dcenter forum were discussing bitcoin, and as usual cautious german nerds they all warned it would fail and can not be of real value yadda yadda...I heard of it again when I got some free time and was researching alternative money systems 3 years later...of course I did not buy in 2010 because of german naysayers ;) From now on I am only gonna consult germans when it comes to strictly technical things ;)

is this true? "The stated intention is to let people adjust the fee paid, but in fact their change also allows people to change the payment to point back to themselves, thus reversing it."
if so, boycott core and 0.12, nobody into bitcoin wants reversible payments. why did I not know this?

how is the cost of running a full node high? what how many watts do you need right now and how much internet bandwidth?
if you ask me bitcoin primary purpose should be a store of value. of course if that succeeds, people are gonna want to exchange that value between each others, right?
but first things first...does this mean I am in the 1MB camp? because I see bitcoin primarily as a store of value. aren't there many altcoins out there who would do a better quicker job for daily consumer mass transactions? - or do we not want to give them our market share? i mean if we let them do the global daily currency thing, it might also be used as a store of value.
hmm, difficult problem it seems, where can I follow some thought processes on all this? I'd like to get involved.
been thinking: couldn't we introduce a proportional transaction fee? it would prevent spam and diminish ultra low value bitcoin transactions. why does bitcoin have to be that samaritan between the payment methods out there who allows it do send millions of $ for the same absolute fee as a couple cents? does not really make sense to me.
if you transfer 40000 satoshis and pay 0.01% fee for it wouldn't it hurt just as little if you payed 0.01% fee on a 4000 bitcoin transaction? wouldn't this solve many problems in the current discussion on blocksize?
btw do nodes get rewarded currently? why do we have to rely on idealists to run this whole thing?
I mean come on, we are already so silly compete-able that I think we should maybe enforce the system where it needs to be enforced - did the whole altcoin mania not give us the right clues and inspiration?
I wonder...can't be that hard to overcome the current issue...
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:44:28
really good balanced and mature article. I like this.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:13:55
been in between r/btc and r/bitcoin for months too, and levelheaded clear responses like these completely dismantle what's going on over there...I think segwit is the right solution in terms of technology and progress. as much as I would personally and ideally like a simple blocksize increase, it heavily looks best if we go for segwit, unlimited, unfortunately, is not much of a competition, and the status quo, while good and working, is no long term solution - I think miners will profit from segwit too - that being said, the arguments of r/btc are rather populist and easy to digest, so I initially fell for it, unless they come up with real prove for any conspiracy, it's all just steam&amp;dust

I was suspicious of all this mainstream bitcoin praise all the time, maybe a try to become our false friend to later betray us? now mike admits to have sold out to banks, and I think the fight is on guys. but remember: we are spartans.
they better find better ways to attack bitcoin. stuff like that only makes it stronger.
the grip of the banks over economy and more and more of our daily lives has never been challenged as severely as with bitcoin.
I'd expect the mainstream media to change tone over bitcoin, but oh wait, average joe already learnt how to use the internet for alternative news inputs, so I guess it is soon game over for bankistan.
unless the powers that be shut down global communications they are pretty much screwed. if they try and create chaos and destruction and bring us back to stone age, they will be pay a fierce price for it.
people are informed worldwide and whenever things start getting out of hand we know who to blame. this time it won't be some bought dictator whose head will roll, but this time the heads of those who paid for him will roll.
that being said, I think they are scared shitless already.
there is no more such thing as information and thus opinion monopoly, and there is no more sole money creation monopoly either.
these two things combined mean real and genuine freedom, something most of us never even breathed in their lives, while being slammed with mere shells of the meanings of these words.
not anymore. good times, exciting times ahead.

Idk if I should even bother...after all if I try to sell them agree on a sale value, thus giving it value, even talking about them is giving them value...they are a joke, and an attempted attack on bitcoin to boost altcoins, BU is not bitcoin, it really goes against the trust-less principles of Bitcoin, basically BU is a scam that will probably backfire heavily at the scammers, forcing them to roll back their chain and invalidate all transactions made on it - it will make bitcoin stronger and enable it to evolve.

lol, everyone waiting on the decision of an institution that prevented investigators from following the money that financed 911 :) just saying, not very cypherpunk
if they allow it you'll see some roller coaster, if they deny it we see the usual growth cause of the limited deflationary supply of Bitcoin
let them enter the game and say hello to some wild swings, oh and they could at some point just steal the candy by making it illegal if they don't like it anymore

we are really really not in the mon &amp; pop zone yet, but once we approach that in about 3 years, I will let go of some of my coins for sure, until then, I hodl, but I want my coin to actually not be limited by 1mb blocks, I want a 2m block coin so bitcoin can grow. supply what is demanded already and fork.

still expecting, but not welcoming, another november 2013-like rally, on top of which everyone will be like "do you know bitcoin??" and all the 'idiots' come, would not be surprised if it shot straight to 4-5k - and then some bad news hits, or some exchange gets raped, and bam, back we go, and if we are unlucky it takes 2 years to recover again :) so, this chart is not very realistic imho

it is pathetic how our society only focusses on winners, instead of principles and ideas. I bet we will get a bubble to $2-4k (or if shit gets crazy to 10k) and then at least a 20%-40% fallback because of this, especially in the 10k scenario
so there we go, hello volatility, in this case upwards I guess..
oh and btw, check my older posts, I repeatedly predicted another nov13 run, this time we might peak at 10k, not 1k, it's the hype factor, and it happens because ppl focus on winners - we now have gold parity, an ATH, and well that ETF that people seem exited about (not me btw much) - so I stay with my prediction, new hype phase, this time, no moon, but 10k will do, I'll sell 50% then lol, cause I don't like hypes and thank god I told nobody I hold btc, so nobody will come asking me, or try to rob me for that matter, enjoy the ride...:)
oh and since an ath is kinda something to celebrate: thanks go out to all the programmers and IT people including core team, who believed in this &amp; keep making it possible, you rock, and you might be playing a major role in restructuring our societies for the coming centuries - for the better.

@_date: 2017-03-24 00:40:29
seems to boil down to this, also I don't understand why they would not profit from Bitcoin growing in usage, price, and overall transaction numbers. note that increased 2nd layer transactions also increase on chain transactions, and thus leads to the need of bigger blocks anyways, someone explain to me the miner's rationale

@_date: 2017-03-24 23:27:51
so both are against compromise, and the fact that neither are for a 2MB HF + SW/LN nor a 4MB HF + SW/LN means what? that both "sides" are 'compromised'? (no pun intended)
I actually thought it makes engineering sense to first implement SW/LN and then, according to requirement, raise the blocksize. also because it saves nodes bandwidth and disk space, and is finally better for decentralisation...but what do I know..

I regret how political Bitcoin has become, let's find a way back to technical solutions to cryptographic networking problems, shall we?
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:53:31
the technology is fine, it would benefit from an upgrade, from a safe one that is, but I don't know how that affects the price - selling now could mean two things: 1. betting on the strong possibility markets don't like uncertainty 2. forcing miners to think rather than just earn money.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:42:45
am I the only one that thinks bitcoin might even halve in value if a fork happens? ... worried tbh... we don't even know if chinese miners get bribed to disable bitcoin? if they are profit oriented, which was assumed by the whitepaper, what stops them to make more profit by the higher bidder, in this case, speculatively, chinese government?
that being said, if china plays the bitcoin game the right way, it might emerge as the one allowing bitcoin to prosper and abolishing the petro-military-dollar system
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:56:46

@_date: 2017-03-24 23:16:12
I was of that opinion as well, but do you have any evidence that my mere idea holds any value actually? I mean the one that both sides are being incentivised/financed by the same entity. if that is the case, then doing nothing and let bitcoin stay the way it is from now on til what, 2150, or forever would be the best thing.
months ago I was actually of that exact opinion, but I discarded the actual potentially hostile influence of a possibly hostile entity like Axa, financing block-stream and further down the road also the core devs, as too far fetched. yes it is possible, but it is even more possible core devs will not bow before fiat-financing for the chance to code history. I trust them no matter who finances them. also, they offer progress and bitcoin will just skyrocket if it goes through.
on the other side, bitcoin would do well even if left alone, it actually does not need to scale. but the price will tank with the drama, and you know, you can create drama, lots of it, you just need to finance two camps and let them fight more ferociously day after day
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:33:28
so true, but buddy, greed gets the better half of most of us just too often ;) we'll see, there is a way to profit from swings like this though: cascaded buy orders down to a price which you think it will go to at most

could be an attack for political or personal reasons, ver does not sound like he has the best intentions for bitcoin, he prolly has his best intentions for himself...but bitcoin is designed to cope with these kinds of attacks, I just think what doesn't kill bitcoin, makes it stronger, so far it has not died, and I think it never will
@_date: 2016-01-21 05:01:12
man accept your loss. there is no moral nor legal obligation for anyone to outweigh one human's error with another one's.

@_date: 2017-03-10 00:56:11

maybe he just needs to piss away his bitcoins, like everyone else who doesn't get it, I think Roger does not understand too much about Bitcoin does he?
@_date: 2016-01-21 05:25:36
oh man you are so wrong, sorry. but this is what's going to happen: people get more careful and responsible. to move responsibility away from the own stupidity and/or mistakes, is something that seems normal and apparent in a service based economy. today, you don't need to care anymore, this luxury of not caring has brought us a financial system which can print money out of nothing, and rob your savings by inflation, or by hidden banking fees. but average joe does pay for this luxury because he likes not to care.
to finish my point of what is going to happen after this pretext: average joe is going to care again and take responsibility for himself. this, i predict, will ideally cause a paradigm shift in society, maybe even change our whole wasteful market economy to something sustainable?
go figure, you can't seriously argue that the masses are going to reject something unrelenting but fair just because people are stupid and lazy? I bet my balls people will change before they miss out on that one time chance. we are not born lazy, we are just getting used to it when growing up. all this might change, society might change.

jep, has been for years, until ppl figured out what bitcoin really is about. me sending money globally for low fees is cute, but I could do that for free with paypal's "send to friends" what was way more appealing than that relatively low fee was, is, and will always be the fact that nobody needs to know, and nobody needs to allow me to send something...
but yeah, it was the main selling point, like, a cheap salesman line and we all circlejerked over that western union bitcoin poster, I admit I liked it too, it was cute, but it was an ad, probably intended to create lots of attention without going too much into detail, attracting lots of plebs...those plebs now think that the best way to scale bitcoin is a simple blocksize increase d'uh...
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:23:25

jep, never invest more than you are willing to lose worst case. I always sticked to exactly that paradigm with bitcoin, I made a nice profit by buying down to $175 after the goxxing, I was basically saying goodbye to some of my fiat and basically exchanged it for an idea which I deem more suitable as sound money than any government- and ultimately bank backed fiat currency.

PartI: 
thanks for participating here Eric, much appreciated :)
let me try to add one thought that I can't not write about:
you say: "he cares about this project more than almost anyone"
well, that's the biggest issue I have with his decision-making, it seems to be emotionally driven. If I were his friend, I would sit down with him, pour him the finest single malt, and tell him, as a friend, to maybe let go of 75% of his stash, to relax his view and emotional involvement in the project he dedicated his life to, and to diversify his dedications in life maybe as well.
he really seems to make a very common parenting mistake: suffocate their beloved kids with love, attention, advice, and care. you if you hug a baby hard enough, it doesn't matter if it came from love or from hate, you will kill it.
forgive me for using such graphic language, but I am just trying to outline an idea and make a point here.
is there any chance you could convince him to consider that his involvement to „Bitcoin" acting like a personal rogue knight, politicising miners, using "not-ok" tools to make a point is probably hurting his pet project „Bitcoin" more than what he is trying to protect it from?
I hope this idea gets to him. from my impression of him, without ever having met him, he really sounds like he is just a little or a lot too involved in all of this project and apparently has lost his levelheaded neutral stance towards it? I think, in order for Bitcoin to succeed, it needs levelheaded, emotionally non-involved people foremost.
Bitcoin does not need personalities, it is not designed that way. it hurts from from personal believes and from people who are emotionally too involved in the project.
now don't get me wrong, I would kinda like to see bitcoin succeed as well, but that is not why I hold bitcoins.
I hold Bitcoin, because of an idea, and the lack of single entities, personalities, and leader figures in this project. that makes it a total novelty and spikes my interest for it. but the way roger is trying to exert control over his vision for Bitcoin is 1. not well thought through and thus dangerous, and 2. not what I signed up for, and pretty sure not why many others came here for.
Imagine one thing: let's assume satoshi comes out of the dark to "solve" all our dirt slinging issues and silly problems.
just imagine 
would I keep holding my bitcoins if satoshi came back for whatever reason? hell no! I’d sell it all!
and you know why? for the exact reason, the exact point I am trying to make and the exact idea I try to convey with all these letters.
actually, the wisest thing satoshi, whoever he/she/they is/are or was/were, did, was to disappear and stay the f. out. that way he basically took himself - as a figure of authority - out of the equation that is required for the idea of Bitcoin to work on a profound level (maximum decentralisation on all levels) and by making that move, he offered the community to either successfully work together, or destroy each other like can be usually expected in non hierarchically structured systems facing even minor requirement for decision. 
(in this case, there is or was minor requirement for a decision, because the network is working as supposed, now if you argue: „but the fees!“, well the fees are high because the network is growing, and because some single entity actively and provably exerted influence and politicised miners into buying into the idea BU, by appealing to their greed, exploiting their short-sightedness, and thus making them mine empty blocks to even further press the issue.)
but there, I want to make a special remark:
history, and biology has shown that many organisms, and most certainly humans, are prone to leadership and authority. we do this and organise things even in families, in hierarchical patterns, because it is efficient.
now, 6000 years into modern civilisation, we ran into huge problems because of this biological setup, problems occur, ironically, when scaling societies to an apparently resource finite planet. (I will not go into wether I think resources on the planet are infinite or not, they are in a way, and they are not as well, it’s complicated ;)
fast forward to 2009, someone might have figured all this out, and came up with a potential solution, that either succeeds and maybe even helps mankind to evolve out of it’s authoritarian initial setup, into something higher, better, or at least more sophisticated.
so for the sake of my tiny investment in all of this, please, leave your friggin emotions out of this, and go with the smartest solution a community of much trusted developers comes up with and end this annoying non-discussion of block-size, all this on the foundation of decentralised decision-making and trust. the way it is supposed to work btw, afaik.

guys, let me in on something, BU claims that lightning needs a 3rd party, so it is not trustless like onchain, but still it emerges from the chain and also must be closed on chain - so to open a LN channel, one needs a 3rd party, right?
if this is the case, both scaling solutions are a too big compromise, and bitcoin just can't scale and is "doomed" to be digital gold?

uhm don't mix up cause and effect here, many people "invest" because of bitcoin's deflationary built-in feature. there is a part speculation about it, cause it could crash to 0 if some weird bug were found, but if you understand how it works, it is probably one of the safest high risk/reward assets to invest in..

apart from that I think no miner can be profitable anymore after the halving below 500ish - but of course they could just inflate the fee market again and mine empty blocks and state "this is totally allowed by bitcoin" yeah, trolling is totally legal on the internet too, it just makes you a dick doing it.

what, guess who profited from buying all the way down to the last all time low? even with a hard fork, bitcoin will retain it's value, and if need be on two chains, but most likely there won't even be a fork - I'm pretty optimistic though

makes some sense, but what are the effects of rising fees on miners and markets? could be quite messy, but it might balance itself out. actually as a hodler I don't mind fees much. I am not sure if bitcoin is supposed to be a quick mass payment system, although I can understand if some visionaries want that piece of the cake as well. what about bitcoin is the backing store of value for other mechanisms that run on top of it? sure sounded like the lightning network would do that some day when it's ready. and what exactly are sidechains for that matter?
Is the risk in a hard fork really that big and how necessary is it really?
Guys figure all this out please, your fellow hodler.

it's gonna be a bumpy road, as I said in an earlier post: I got my buy orders set up down to blow $300 but really I don't care I just hope bitcoin succeeds and GROWS. and that human error and greed will not mess up this beatiful disruptive new baby. oh yes, it is still new

what worries me, is that one entity, right now, has the ability to cause a fork, and then attack the other side, correct me if I am wrong, cause I don't know how to technically prevent this, but from another post a BU-guy explained how that can be done, like mixing transactions between both chains to cause confusion

someone from core obviously having found and unique &amp; effective way of reminding BUTT-Devs to do their job. this is a disaster for BU..and if they had any actual influence over the bitcoin ecosystem, it would be at least a tiny little disaster ;)

for having been able to control a big chunk of bitcoin through an ETF, it would have to have attracted a lot of dollars, and with that one can game the system - but, for hodlers it would have meant bitcoins around $2000-$5000 I still like this decision more than an approval, the last thing we need is hodler centralization by a big attractor like an ETF.

buy half of what you want to invest now, and set up buy orders down to what you think it might go down to, if it goes up, do the same again with your second half, if it goes down, wait for it to recover - we're still in a bull market, until after some theoretical crazy price spike, which I don't welcome, but herd mentality is almost inevitable at this point

maybe I miss something, but how are they --not-- going to make more money, if the price goes to 10.000$ and beyond? if Bitcoin gets used way more than now, it is a win-win anyways, no? there is no way the chain-block size will remain at 1MB if lightning channels get used extensively, after all you want to open and close channels to finalize transactions on the blockchain, right?
so network grows, price rises, overall transactions rise exponentially, 2nd layer transactions rise close to exponentially, on chain transactions maybe rise linearly and block size rises linearly as well? I was thinking something like that is likely to happen, anyone disagreeing?
how will this --not-- sustain the incentives of miners? I don't get it..

Am I the only one that thinks a BU fork could have rather disastrous mid term implications? ideally the BU chain would disappear quickly but idk how many ppl want to risk hodling if a chain splits, and even more so if the guy who controls mining hardware and thus ultimately mining power/hashrate, is being against either Bitcoin or Segwit LN - idk about politics but that Juhan Wu guy is playing a dangerous game, or he might have an agenda - we'll see how it works out

@_date: 2017-03-09 12:51:41
the 20 billion dollar question is how far bitcoin will drop before BU forks. if you ask me - it is a conspiracy theory, but there is a possibility china might be bribing miners to attack/overtake/or destroy bitcoin, after all, chines miners pay powerbills and are super prone to government influence, correct me if I am wrong
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:58:08
really liking the UASF approach, and if the accusations about roger ver buying a subreddit and using it for commercial purposes are true, reddit must ban him, and close that subreddit down.
for me the blocksize debate is over, BU is so risky and so not-well-thought-through that it's a no-brainer not to go for it.
took me way to long to figure this out..
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:11:49
it's not just the fork, ppl also seem frustrated that the better solution is being blocked by chinese miners. since they like earning money, they probably flip and support SW once price hits 750 or less.. the question is incentive, why change anything as long as you earn good money with a high price? the best ideas and decisions are born in scarcity, not abundance.
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:11:14
look, from the outside bitcoin looks like some kind of penny stock or a tulip mania bubble. but actually this thing fails or prevails depending on an idea, and right now it looks like people really want to challenge that idea.
if the idea of bitcoin is worth it's money and 100 times as much shows if those BU clowns actually try to fork/force it into something different. they even want to take the name with them lol.
so we'll see if the price of $1200 right now is mainly idealists, enforced by mere math, or if it is speculators, trying to maximise their profits at all costs!
I suggest everyone who is in this for the price and an as quick as possible trip to the moon, to support bitcoin unlimited! then these people shall get what they deserve. it will either be a crazy inflation of their idea of value, or no value at all.
TLDR a fork that does not follow the idea and idealism of bitcoin, based by math and the idea of decentralisation, will drop to 0 in an instant. if you are in here to maximise your investment, you risk forking helping to fork the coin and rendering your investment worthless. given that the fiat debt based money you used to finance your initial investment it would not even be considered a loss, more like a lesson.
there are many things on deeper levels of things and all matter is interconnected man, if you think like an investor, you really get what you deserve in the end.
and even if all this may sound like voodoo and cultist to you, well yes, I am guilty in trusting math as my ruler. I firmly believe the ruler of our universe to be math! it is the structure that defines all our aesthetics and arts, the principle of beauty is symmetry with little flaws, that symmetry follows fractal patterns, and guess what, fractals are mathematical formulas.
if anything, people of the world should worship mathematics and science, but not religious institutions like churches and universities, which have been corrupted by very unscientifically proven flawless money systems like the debt based fraud called central banking fiat system.
trust me, the money system we have right now is the root cause for an army of issues and problems that derive from it. people are here and hold bitcoins cause they think bitcoin has the potential to be an actually fair mean of value exchange, that is not manipulatable, even less manipulatable than precious metals, cause guess what, if you control a big chunk of gold mines by shares, you could control supply and thus price!
try doing that with bitcoin :) if anything, the first adopters, meaning the first ones to really get the idea of bitcoin, of which I would be one of, if not for some stupid gullible germans in a german forum talking down what I told them about bitcoin in 2010 - well, these early adopters deserve to hold a big chunk of early coins, they get rewarded for understanding what is necessary for real change, and not the kind of fake change that a clown like Obama promises...so, they, and the developers who got this thing rolling, basically all geeks or nerds, mathematically skilled people with a sense for the bigger picture, they might become the new monetary elite one day!
and tell you what, I'd rather have them as the ones profiting from an exponential growth in a high tech market than the hundreds of years of extortion that the Rothschild clan provably imposed on whole nations, including Napoleon, Bismarck etc, to finally launch their network of money laundering and nation defrauding central bank-machines.
there is one very slight chance they set this thing up themselves, but if they did, I'll bow and show my respect. if you are so sophisticated in creating a system that seems to free people from the central banking terror, presenting it as a real solution, fooling all the tech communities around the word, well, then you just deserve to rule the world ;)
any more questions? :)

catching falling knifes in bitcoin is a piece of cake, as long as you are sure it will survive overall. times like these are filled with uncertainty, markets get volatile, wiggle around a lot, I expect a continual rise once there is clarity or some positive change in this debate, it really gets annoying, so annoying ppl want to sell and buy back later. I actually kind of bet on a falling price as that may be the only way to convince miners to start thinking and seeing things more clearly that SW and LN are the most reasonable solutions to the current growth pains we undergo
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:25:22
this whole BU buzz really smells like China trying to get a grip on Bitcoin, if they are not careful, it will blow up in their face, if you ultimately push Bitcoin into the underground, you make it even more desirable, the Pandora's box has been opened and there is no way back, China better embrace Bitcoin instead of trying to strangle it

I usually am no holder advocate, cause you gotta use your brain, but markets are either irrational, or hostile. tendency is you lose if you trade. I did trade a little in this, lost a little more, just not worth it.

@_date: 2017-03-09 12:48:18
yeah right, what do you say about 70% of hasrate probably causing a bitcoin fork? do you know if the chinese government may be bribing miners to attack the network cause it does not want competition?
the problem I always had with bitcoin was that mining was centralised in china, I initially bought bitcoin cause it was supposed to be decentralized, now we have lots of nodes, which is good for decentralization, but if miners are all sacked and packed up ready to be harvested by the grim reaperman in one country, well then...I think I better wait out until the fork situation is settled, etf does not play a big role in all of this imho
I think we need some radical change, maybe core devs, which are the brain of bitcoin anyways, might need to find an intelligent way to fork and let chines miners become obsolete - maybe even a POW to POS change? miners are exerting too much power, system seems flawed, someone enlighten me if I am writing uninformed BS please.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:25:51
that would be the irony of 2017 in crypto so far ;) - I'm just imagining if something like that happened after a theoretical fork, makes me think there will be no fork, or BU will just explode like the Challenger 1986
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:16:58
your argument makes sense if you assume that the time needed to find a solution of the problem does not apply enough selling pressure to make the price drop
if you add to the idea that a lower price puts pressure on miners to use their brains and go for the best solution instead of just wasting time energy and Rolex mining Bitcoin, that makes a price drop even, well, desirable? correct me if my idea has flaws..

why are hard forks unsafe, is it because of the coordination effort and the logistics to synchronize the whole ecosystem including all merchants and nodes? curious about a few more detailed thoughts on it - if yes does that mean bitcoin is too big to hard fork like smaller alt-coins do without issues? I have no problem with soft forks per se, I just would like more detail on why hf are problematic for bitcoin at this stage - thanks!

vague? they use the very valid argument of not burdening nodes anymore, we need many nodes, and ideally they have to be ran by enthusiasts and private individuals - an increase in blocksize causes more centralization, probably leading to a not unsubstantial amount of nodes maybe shutting down? and if segwit leads to payment channels that are anchored in the blockchain, then there really is no need to dare a blocksize increase - I was against SW LN until I figured out lightning channels are perfectly on chain solutions, and not some mumbo jumbo 3rd party as it sounds like on the first view

the time is ripe for decentralized exchanges
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:10:16
you clearly don't understand bitcoin. let me give you an advice. the day bitcoin loses one of it's pillars of decentralisation, it becomes as worthless as fiat. you do use USD, don't you? you take it and invest it and think you are maximising it's value? well guess what, through a sophisticated process those dollars you use are created as debt, and if you use them you accept and even assume the values it stands for. currently it stands for HSBC drug money scandals, enforcement of terror and war in the world, economic extortion and shadow budgets involved in the 911 attacks, just to name a few. so, it is a cesspool of delusion and lies, oh and don't get me started with how much Woodrow Wilson regretted his role in helping the banksters incarnate that hellhole of a central bank, oh and the cancer that is central banking in this world, financing major wars...
anyways, if you take these usd, and invest them into some asset, the best thing you can achieve is to stay equal with the value of your money. if you haven't noticed, the actual inflation we have is way higher than the reported one. companies are outsourcing labor and making their products more efficient, namely cutting down on material quality and costs. all this to stay competitive, but why are we competing so much? tell you why. cause someone is sucking up and out all the air in the room, and this is what central banks really are here for, to defraud whole societies.
you think bitcoin was invented to as an asset or do you look at it like a regular asset? if you approach it with that mindset, you better try to push the bitcoin unlimited agenda, cause they promise huge gains and they want to "unleash" bitcoin! in the fine print though, there is that nifty little negligible remark that they would compromise on one of the core values of the whole bitcoin endeavour, risking that people might think about it for two seconds and then decide that &lt;that&gt; bitcoin would not endorse the same values the bitcoin that they bought in the first place endorsed.
look, don't get me wrong, riding the bitcoin train and profiting from it: nothing wrong with it, but not understanding why bitcoin is here and what actual problem it is supposed to solve, and also not grasping why so many are here for such long time really could lead to something different. if we were all here for blind greed, bitcoin would have failed already. cause the thing with greed as a motivation for action is: it corrupts. and none of us can afford a corrupt version of bitcoin :)
so what you are proposing really sounds like a fork, but a mental one! you sound like some of these dudes on r/investing that have no problem buying stocks from Goldman Sachs, I mean, why, it gives good dividends, no question asked.
the pretty thing about bitcoin is that it is designed in a way to even deal with people's greed, it does not get corrupted by it. but in the end, what it actually hold together is the shared idea of a value system that is not corruptible by single entities or human features like greed!
your mindset, admittedly only gathered from this single post of yours, really sounds like the spirit of greed without any idealism.
I am really starting to want to see if the (mental) fork that people like you bring to bitcoin results in an actual blockchain fork, and then how well that fork will do!
I can envision this scenario: first BU might attract a few greedy idiots and the price might shortly get higher than Core, but then you will just have people that BU must burn down to the core as it ironically would have have applauded to the core values of bitcoin itself!
Now all this may sound like some cultist almost religious like babbling of some follower or whatever, but rest assured, I am absolutely non emotional about bitcoin, I see it as tech, math, and logic. it is just a nifty technical tool to solve a problem humans have so far not been able to agree on a solution thereof, so far.
And even more importantly than that: bitcoin actually is carried ONLY by math and the idea that that math expresses. it is as worthless as any fiat currency, it has no real value other than the value people attach to it.
Now ask yourself, why do people attach value to bitcoin? why do mathematicians and really nerdy people attach value to it? is there a chance it is a tulip bubble or just some kind of hype? man, think again, not many ppl are in this for the profit or the monetary gain, many people are actually in it for the revolutionary idea that the underlying concepts of this network expresses, AND take the financial gains as a side-effect.
if you think about it, this is how things should be, it just happened that our minds really got swamped with self serving logic through bogus debt money, you think we are in here for the gain? what value does any kind of gain have without an idea? wtf. without ideas life would be absolutely pointless, there would be no art and no music, we could basically all kill ourselves or maximise numbers on a computer because it would just absolutely not matter.
man, either you are very old, or there is some other reason why your mindset really triggered me, as I see myself as a part of a new generation of young people who don't take any shit anymore.
tell you something: young people have figured out that lies and the systematic corruption almost in it's entirety, all helped by access to free uncensorable information over the internet. sure, there is counterintelligence, and now the clown come up with this "fake news" smokescreen, but many young people have figured out that there is a better way of social behaviour than the one that dominated the last few thousand years.
people have figured out there is no more more real scarcity in resources on this planet, they figured out the game is rigged, and after the Lehman fraud (some call it a crisis, but I call it what it was, a fraud) some really wise guy invented a system that would systematically dismantle the exact fraud mechanism, that leads to fraud in this world on 2n and 3rd layers, down to corruption of human psyche, creating idea-less zombies who run around thinking that there would be no other reason why people would "park" their money except to maximise wealth!"
so, I hope I have been clear, many of us are here to support an idea and profit from doing so as a secondary effect. I don't really know any other actual "bitcoiners" but since everyone tells you here not to invest what you can not afford to lose, many here would drive this train either to the moon or to 0. why? are they stupid? why not cash out when price drops 50%? why do you think I bought from $600 down to $175 in steps of $25?

Part II
If roger is not able to see what actual influence he has on all of this since quite a while, then he may have been one of Bitcoin's most important contributors, but he is no more, more trending towards the opposite.
As a friend, please tell him this. His heart might be broken for a while, but I am sure he will get over it, no?
One last thing, just to make my principles clear here: I almost don't even care about the contents&amp;arguments of any ‚side‘ in this whole debate. sure technical arguments are important for engineering the best solution to a networking problem, but:
if one side brings up a single entity that has "authority" because "has been...most important contributor" or anything else that smells like personalities, and that single entity exerts lots of traceable influence over what is generally accepted as a decentralised self governing, open source system, then I completely oppose that single entity 'almost' without even listening to it's arguments/contents.
this last point is just to make clear that in all of this, especially if you have no clue about engineering like me, you follow a decentralized decisionmaking system, rather than a single entity with "reputation" or "credibility" or "merit" or "early adopters" simply because I am well aware that we are prone to make decisions this way on a very basic level, and I want to counter that. for the same reason, I particularly don’t follow charismatic leader figures in politics, they usually abuse and take advantage of some human hardwiring and exploit their tainted and tilted decision making.
but if we fall for this way of decision-making in this particular case of a decentralized value exchange and storage system, we will most likely end up with some kind of replaceable centrally controlled token exchange system, value close to 0 or whatever the corporation enforcing the token-system agree on adhering it to.
so please, advise roger to control his temper, cut back on what he personally wants Bitcoin to become, and remind him to take this advice if he really is that dedicated to Bitcoin, as you state. otherwise he might want to start looking for something else to dedicate his life to.
or maybe he should have children and learn that the worst thing you can do in parenting is forcing life decisions on your kids with the omnipresent reasoning „I only want your best„ I am talking about all those med and law students that wanted to become artists but submerged to the will of their dominating parents, which I’m sure, always only want the best for their kids, oblivious to the fact that the best they could want for their kids, is something fundamentally different to what is actually the „best“ for their kids, and „best“ needs to even be defined when growing up, and ideally this happens without any tainting from caring or loving authority personnel, but that is just my take on parenting as a non parent, so take it as you want.
last but not least, I don't like to do ad hominem, and I tried not to use a certain term, but I guess I have to, because I think it is worth mentioning after all I just tried to explain:
Roger shows so much emotional devotion to this project, one could figure this feature of his leaning towards fanaticism.
there you go, needless to say fanatics are the last thing Bitcoin needs. I heard accusations over luke-jr's religious views back when I still occasionally looked up that other sub, and I just hope these are not true - fanatics, and emotionally too attached people, please get rid of your stake in Bitcoin, and find something else to obsess about, but that is just my personal desire ;) 
last paragraph, I promise: personally, I think bitcoin will only succeed if we can collectively let our emotions out of this project. we all need to chill out, take it as granted that we might or even definitely will lose the fiat or electricity we invested in this project to get richer in an experience, and/or to be able to one day state: at least we tried. now the irony of all of this is: if we try too hard, it is more probable to fail than if we try less hard. i.e. for all the reasons I tried to outline in all of the prior text. sit back, relax, trust that the community will never give radicals and too emotionally attached people too much attention, and focus on posts and discussion that are solving engineering problems, market news and developments, and adhere to ideas that we all bought in being part of this project.
now if you think that bitcoin needs to grow and become a replacement for daily payments, micro transactions etc. you are right, but
a) it does not need to go there in a rush. it won’t lose it’s edge. it’s edge is already given as the safest store of value
b) a simplistic block-size increase is not the best solution to that demand engineering wise.
c) single entities exerting power over the community is more a test to the community, than it is any help, maybe in the end both, but worst case it is a danger.
last remark: I also would welcome a 2-4MB HF + SW LN, but even more I would like to see SW activated already on 1MB before that, just for the positive effect on hardware wallets and other solutions it brings, then gradually increase block-size as demand requires. if bitcoin grows the way I expect it to, we will need lots and lots of opening and closing of LN channels on the chain, and thus the block-size needs to gradually grow along with the demand, logically.
TLDR: please tell roger he needs to cut down on his emotional involvement with Bitcoin. it is hurting bitcoin more than any kind of block-size limitation, (coming from an average relatively late bitcoin adopter)

Bitcoin is definitely not a scam, but it might fail if it's core assumptions get proven wrong.
first of all, satoshi never thought about pooled mining might be a reality, but here we are, and we don't even have pooled mining, but the pools are mostly in the same country! - not even that, but the country even produces the most cost efficient mining hardware(!) and now the guy who does it used it to extort the network, just wtf.
we need a solution for this asap or the whole chain shatters around the block
I have added 1+1 and came to the conclusion that there might be a plot of the chines government probably putting pressure on miners to destroy, hijack or control bitcoin.
the ladder is not possible, the middle one only works by resulting in the former one, imo
so, someone clear this up for me, everyone is talking about the ETF, but is that really is wat is supposed to worry me right now?
if bitcoin forks and BU also actively tries to evade the countermeasures of Core, then we are in for a really tough time
but I might be wrong, if I am, please enlighten me, but be substantial and as profound as possible

in the long run, the 21 million coins theoretically available, will end up reflecting all current global values, but not because they have to, but because they can.
there won't be any glorious victory of bitcoin that many may dream of, instead there will be a silent decay of all fiat systems that were mathematically guaranteed to fail in the first place, and then bitcoin will just be the casual bystander like "meh, guess I'm the last man standing".
this goes along well with the rumours going round that the BIS is preparing to go back to the gold standard. not sure what this will cause in detail but it can't hurt to own both gold and bitcoin. I would stay away from fiat and stocks, as well as real estate, which got pumped with cheap central bank money globally in the last few decades, not at all precious metals though. arguably crypto got pumped by this money too, but, crypto is a special case. too novel, too low liquidity. it can go to 2k or shoot to 200k or both.

there will be no fork. there will be roger who boosted eth and will have made nice profits once he buys back bitcoin, a coin backed by peer reviewed open source quality code, quality devs, and miners which will not mine empty blocks nor leverage their "ver-imposed" positions with empty threats.
in 1 month from now everyone in this space will have realized that what actually happened were all empty threats. miners will not risk a pow-change, and core can rely on miners to eventually figure out that SW and LN will make them even more profits than inflating the fees by bullying the network.
so, SW will get activated, price moons - and - if the whole switch to the core scaling model ever becomes a systemic achilles heel for Bitcoin, like making it prone to state interference, then there are already a few (very few) alts waiting with actual good tech and solid features (not talking about eth or dash here) waiting for bitcoin to flinch, which, in that case, would get the attention and gradual inflow of bitcoins without the need of excessive shilling that is happening on r/btc
so, Bitcoin is the king of the hill, in my opinion even without SW. but with SW, it either moons and succeeds, or moons and fails somewhen down the road because of a systemic unfixable flaw.
if you ask me, the question is not BU or SW, but "do nothing" vs "SegWit". so, BU is over. clown car exploded ;)

man, of course we are talking about people and personal opintions, take mine as a personal opinion and move on, I wish there would be a formula for profiling people, but there is only guessing, also, there is the paradox that people, once someone figured them out, will just fork and change into someone else with a new ruleset! I noticed that once I figured out women - the irony, you can never admit it a woman that you know what makes her tick, she will just throw her ruleset over board in order to feel "unique" again, so roger might do what roger does, but from what I read of him, he is either trying to play the markets, or go piss away his fortune for an idea that does not make much technical sense. it all depends on who investors and hodlers will follow, will they follow populism and loud leader figure, or will they go with that makes bitcoin valuable in the first place. I really don't know how it turns out :)

I do, but there is one rather secure rule this time, the real greed kicks in if the price reaches ATH before the actualy halvening.
psychologically what happens then will be many new people who may have heard the term "bitcoin" years back to really join the club, rise the price to 2k+ levels, just to later crash it with their fear to high 1k levels.
mark my words
scenario two: ATH is not reached before halvening, then it will not be reached quickly after, price will also relax, but down to 600-800 levels I guess.

fair in terms of a product that wants to be a store of value and a respected fair medium of exchange, needs to have a rather fair initial distribution, but it is just almost impossible to really pull it off in fairness, maybe and airdrop to 7 billion people? how do you manage such a thing. I think the fact that 1 million coins are in the hands of satoshi, and alledgedly 2 million coins held by a small group around him, might curb future growth and adoption. thoughts are "why should I invest in something of which I can only assume it is not a ponzi?" or "what if the inventor is alive and one day decides to sell all his coins or buys influence over poltics on top of his fortune?" or "what if this becomes the world currency, and we got a dormant holder of 1m coins that can dominate and extort the markets, wouldn't that be terribly irresponsible?"
I am a big advocate for bitcoin and blockchain tech, but when it comes to currencies, especially big unifying currencies, I am starting to lean more towards national currencies, currencies that reflect the local cultures and values, not one big unifying currency to rule them all. now if we could prove the satoshi coins to be inaccessible, or if we would see them accessed and sold now, aka distributed, I would not oppose bitcoin becoming the world currency, but how things are, it's a bigger-scale gamble to support this.
this, and the fact that in msm nobody was ever really attacking bitcoin, contrarily even embracing it, makes me think we might have been lured into some plot for a one world currency, one to rule them all.
like andreas antonopolous kept repeating it would be better if we got attacked and stress-testet now, rather than later "now is the time to stress test this"
now, what if the powers that be already know how to hijack this ship and ultimately use it to further their influence and power? could this be a reason why it was attacked so little so far?
you guys do know what the powers in charge do to countries like Iraq and Lybia, when their leaders decide to sell their oil for euros and gold, instead of USD? hint: they get bombed back to stone-age.
now, what if those countries decided to use bitcoin instead? if bitcoin is a real threat to the global dollar hegemony, which, if real, it must be, as it defies all power and influence over currency and western markets, maybe even global markets, which currently the FED holds control over, then I need to assume it would have to be scared shitless about bitcoin and thus fight and attack it on all fronts. the fact that this does not happen, makes it very very suspicious to me.
as always, only invest what you are willing to lose, and if you hold tons of bitcoins, and it makes 95% of your net-worth, then by all means sell until it makes only about 5-10% of your net-worth. nobody can afford to lose 95% of their net-worth believing in a cause they can not prove is a good1. my2sats..

as much as I dislike any fiat currency, stock markets are so extremely overbought, just like real estate, that both will crash once the central banks are forced to do the magic "interest rate flip-trick", whereby money suddenly becomes expensive and valuable again, and people will hodl dollars and euros...so it might be not so stupid to actually be in fiat rn. they know they can't print money forever and the only reason for the immense stock market rises was cheap credits and loans, all this is going to collapse soon, and bitcoin, who knows what bitcoin will do, if whales bought bitcoin to 20k cause of cheap credit, then they will exit more and we go lower...if bitcoin will be a safe haven when stocks crash, and people diversify on anything money, then bitcoin will likely rise during such a period...justmy2sat

so what, right now there is a problem, until there is a real solution for it (lightning network or similar) we need to increase blocksize or watch price collapse, as it is just starting since chinese miners chickened out on 2mb fork...what a joke this is, well, i predict the price to scratch 300 when chiners chicken out again and fork to 2mb then rebound to 800+

do you think they have not considered it? with sw2x we are going to see whether bitcoin bulges over political pressure or not. there are no technical reasons not to wait for SW and 2nd layer solution and THEN reassess whether we need more blocksize through a hard-fork or not! hard forks are NO joke and should not be applied in a rushed way.
also, one does not do tech by compromise, especially not in an open source, open devs, and open participation system. if the miners want to do power-plays, let them, the whole ship might go down with it long term, but who cares, right?

@_date: 2017-08-23 06:35:22
it really depends on whether (imho) some exchange cooks their books or not - one thing is for sure: it is high risk, high reward with the potential of total loss, which leads to people to only invest what they are willing to lose which causes coins to spread to more people essentially creating a fair and leveled playing field in the long term. only a few are crazy enough to hold more than 1000 or 10000 coins, but they got rewarded big so far, so, I really like this
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:26:02
it doesn't matter I think, mining will not become un-profitable by a shrinking block-reward, it might by shrinking interest / demand for bitcoin, but I can't see how that should happen, bitcoin is an ingenious design, and as long as people want to tell other people how they wanna spend their money there will be demand for it. oh and it just got upgrades that will take it very far imho.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:37:11
all it causes is massive selling pressure on the BCH side. anyone who does not sell his BCH right now might regret it when the miners with massive BCH block rewards in their pockets, decide to dump. correct me if I am wrong but all this algo does, its create heavy inflation on BCH which the market must swallow, and given there is 0 actual real world use for BCH as a cryptocurrency, it is almost certain to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:38:56

dollar cost averaging is a good strategy, but knowledge of what is happening is the better strategy, if you assume institutional investors who were already hedged with bitcoin during the bullrun as a diversification strategy, will dump crypto first before sticking to most stable stocks and later bonds, then don't buy now, if you assume institutional investors are still largely waiting for the next bull run to fomo in, then buy now ;)

it does not make much sense to scale a distributed ledger (which is inefficient from the get go) by increasing blocksize and make it even more inefficient. it has various very bad side-effects if you try to do so. I don't know why other people can't figure this out by logic, probably because this is reddit and it is full of trolls ;) anyways, yes, satoshi stated on several occasions ways of scaling by 2nd layers and this is a prime example.

if you are paying someone for candy, and want this transaction recorded in history for at least a hundred or a thousand years without any government or single decentralized party ever being able to undo this transaction, possibly even for all eternity, you should be ok waiting some time, or choose a fee higher than the cost of the candy :) or you could use paypal or some other centralized ledger that will delete your transaction after they ease to exist. if your friend lives close to you, consider using actual USD coins, after all I assume it is just for candy, but if this candy has symbolic value, like you inherited it from someone beloved, and sell it to your brother for a symbolic price and want this transaction to be remembered and carved in stone forever, by all means use bitcoin and pay up :) (or wait if the fees get lower again, mostly on weekends)

in case you are wondering: it is very unlikely this could happen to bitcoin, and if it happened, it would lead to a more future proof (quantum resistant) PoW function, and a way more decentralized bitcoin mining space.
also, it would lead to the 49% of the honest miners to really get angry at the attackers. since we already know bitmain is making power-plays, they would face serious threats from the rest of the mining community that just lost their investments in mining hardware. the attacker would lose their investments in mining hardware, too.
so from game theory, it is very unlikely. a PoW change has already been coded up by luke-jr for this very unlikely worst case scenario

yes, proof of work works when miner's incentives are based on greed as expected, problems arise when mining centralizes though, as it could tilt the incentive from greed to survival. if threatened by chinese gov, would jihan not bulge and enter a deal with chinese officials? I'm not quite sure whether or not they have any interest in a freely accessible, globally instant, and permission-less value transfer system like bitcoin ;) this is why I think mining decentralization is so important, for example if many nations started having their 'bitmains', incentives from each nation to exert political influence over each 'bitmain' would balance-out each other, and it'd be perfectly ok. all the shenanigans coming from bitmain in recent times might be evidence of a chinese government either trying to hijack or outright destroy bitcoin before other nations (hello russia) start mining themselves and thus making bitcoin too big and too decentralized to fail.

yes it does fix this by allowing to use 2nd layer transactions for purchases that are not imortant enough to be written on an eternal ledger (blockchain) like starbucks purchases...many "big-blockers" though will try to convince you otherwise because they want to boost altcoins and profit from that. big blocks will put a strain on the network and it is not the intelligent solution, that does not stop many from promoting it as many think bigger blocks would lead to a higher price, but it is shortsighted thinking imho

I don't want a compromise for political reasons, if we got that route, we will be prone to political games in the future. Block-size increase when needed in the future, but first let's get bitcoin upgraded and see what we can do on side-chains and payment channels, THEN increase blocksize as needed. the way I learnt it, a blocksize increase is a last resort change as it has all kinds of negative side effects.

bloomberg, cnbc, goldman sachs, and maybe many more use their concerted prediction to do exactly what? I tell you: manipulation. yes, they are pulling numbers out of their asses and abusing their brand and traditional market reach to get a foothold into future bitcoin market manipulation. of course this does not matter to hodlers, but if they self fulfill their prophecies by ensuring everyone gets the memo, it could lead to them having too much influence on bitcoin price finding which some might see as an attack vector. Imagine this, they make 5 predictions, and people being sheep sure enough all price predictions hit the mark perfectly, by the time they make a 6th prediction they would have enough followers that they could basically announce bitcoin going to $5, and buy up all coins they can get for $200. in psychology there is this thing called 'conditioning' what they are trying to do is condition/train the market to react to their arbitrary predictions.

there are no good or bad miners, just smart and stupid ones:
miners defecting and playing altcoin speculation with their hashrate are playing a dangerous game. bitcoin mining is not just about greed and rewards, but also about protecting the most valuable network. if you risk that value for some shitcoin that will lead to centralization and lots of other problems down the road, you may lose all your ASIC miners to a PoW change, and make honest miners very angry...just saying, there are smart miners, and there are stupid ones. no need to be thankful to any of each.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:53:49
its not so much about features, bitcoin is built around an idea with more or less arbitrary features, every altcoin can change the total amount of coins, the blocktime, but they can not reinvent the wheel and re-disrupt fiat currency. so, I see them as the 5th wheel on a car. yes, they are different, but I guess it is network effect and first mover advantage which solidifies bitcoin. why would I choose some altcoin, if bitcoin does all I want it to do and is the safest in terms of hashrate?

watching the long term chart of bitcoin, many thought bitcoin would grow in waves, leading from one hype wave and a following multi year selloff to another. especially since many thought the mtgox prices have been real! but it turned out they were manipulated by some mtgox trading bot! so what this means is that one can disregard the mtgox prices for future predictions, and then what comes to mind is something that could be very likely for bitcoin, an s-curve, one that is pretty common for tech-companies, and it happened to facebook and amazon, maybe even tesla, before they were even tradeable (angel investors etc etc), watch this video, it is brilliant and explains everything. So basically I think we might see a very short period of very rapid growth and later a long period of slow growth, but this long period will start with fantasy prices like 100k or 1m per BTC.

haha no, if bitcoin follows through we might see some social change to what intellectuals call "human nature". imho many of the issues we have today come from the historical fact that humans could never agree on a stable and secure value system, and back when we had gold, there was forgery and fakery too, and of course wars, why? well to steal the gold :) you can't steal bitcoins. you can't even prove someone owns any if he does not tell people about it :)
so we might be looking at a society that does not value isolating materialistic values like yachts anymore, instead, more social focus on sharing than owning :) but who knows, maybe I am a little too optimistic .)

* 1) as I said, this curve will flat out and go to linear and then to logarithmical, all I am saying this will happen in a way shorter timeframe than anyone expects
* 2) afaik there is good liquidity for bitfinex over hong-kong banks, do you have evidence or proof for your claim? links?
* 3) TA-experts in bitcoin? are you kidding me? this is rocket science and uncharted territory, I could be an expert fwiw...and I actually gave this thing lots of thoughts and before news hit mtgox inflated the price, thus was a price to be excluded in future TA, I was thinking bitcoin would have to grow in waves and I expected another 2 year retrace period, from 10k to idk, 3k, 2k? - anyways, now that we know this was not a real price, we have to assume bitcoin will do a saturation s-curve with a very short period (viral phase) of very steep constant price increase acceleration, which eventually must flatten out when bitcoin saturates the currency market by nations competing over it in mining and buying bitcoin.
* 4) adoption has not increased? have you been to japan recently? and yes, digital gold is the current main use for bitcoin, and who would blame them for using it that way, it is perfect for that, and while we work on scaling it, it will rise in value, regardless of whether it is being used to pay your starbucks bill or not. also, it has not been rebranded as "internet gold" - and I have been around long enough to clearly see that on-chain scaling was technical nonsense as it would lead to node centralization and other undesirable computation and network effects. this is an unacceptable attack vector for centralized (state) actors long term, and now we agreed on scaling this thing on a sub-layer, 2nd layer networks, perfectly pegged to bitcoin - this is elegant efficient design. not sure why you would doubt "decentralized currency anyone could spend" would not be the case with a bitcoin as "digital gold" in its first mainstream use case.

the inflation causes massive selling pressure, lots of block rewards want to get sold for mining costs. bch is either a scam or a very expensive attempt at 51% attacking bitcoin, if I still had bch, I would somewhat sell them now before the miners will

bitcoin price is all about what people are willing to pay for a scarce &amp; useful product in a space without competition, and no, altcoins are no competition imo, as they do basically just the same a little different, and less secure, and came way late to the party (network effect and brand value)
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:08:23
but if the wallet is only secured by a passphrase like the core client, that's the point? or can you recommend a wallet that has the features you describe?
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:08:14
afaik 2013 was a gox trading bot, so price discovery was broken, of course that was a bubble, now, assuming nobody is manipulating prices, we just pay what people are willing to pay on a rather steep  but legit adoption curve. and who said bitcoin could or would not go viral? going viral just means exponential growth until saturation of markets kicks in. now saturation in currency market is quite hard to achieve, prices of 100k to 1m would be needed to see the effects

I think this debate is hurting bitcoin, of course I would be ok with no change at all, as I think the value of bitcoin is neither correlating with scaling capability nor blocksizes. but that is just me, the rest of the (bitcoin)world gets heated up over this and the users go like "meh, I sell and wait until you get your sht together guys" my2sat

thanks for sharing, lower mining cost also means lower difficulty, and lower difficulty ultimately means higher chance of a 51% attack. someone might at some point attack bch with such low difficulty, which adds to price pressure cause of uncertainty

c: artificial inflation on bcash (faster block times) will cause additional inflation which results in massive selling pressure in markets, and since nobody uses bcash for commerce,  miners will dump lots and lots of cheap block rewards on bch holders at some point.

I disagree, multiple blockchain defies the purpose of a blockchain, also I think 'money' is the best app for a blockchain, you can do all sorts of different things with blockchains but 'permissionless money' is already the sweet spot between efficiency and complexity, I'd go as far as to say something like ethereum better run on something centralized, in the long run I see most altcoin-projects peg to bitcoin on a 2nd layer or something. even on-chain obfuscation like monero does, is better done on a 2nd layer of bitcoin, long term altcoins will hold no ground, all of them just got lucky that bitcoin's development seemed to stall indefinitely. if that would have settled in, there would be some grounds for altcoins, but with bitcoin progressing and moving, altcoins are one heck of a gamble.

which is what I was afraid of, peaceful coexistence, sure, but when hashrates go almost equal? if someone wanted to destroy bitcoin, he'd just need to fork and mine the fork with about 50%, and then attack. game theory say miners would not do this, but game theory assumes miners act in greed and are not plotting with roger ver to destabilize bitcoin in order to boost ethereum dash or other altcoins - sure, too much tinfoil on my hat, but...it is a valid concern.

@_date: 2017-08-14 02:31:34
oh but that's just perfectly playing into the hands of bitcoin - cool think about it is that it uses greed and transforms it into security of the network. if you see a high price, you think I need to buy more, if you buy more, some miner sees higher price, and thinks: I need to mine more! some other guy (russia) sees this and says: wait a minute, I want a piece of the cake too! and starts mining! so it is not really fighting for something, it is real and fair competition, bitcoin is fee to participate for anyone, including development, fucking genius who came up with this tbh...but yeah, back to mining, so everyone mines, hashrate rises, difficulty rises and we might be crossing the point at which it will be physically impossible for a single entity to out-mine every other entity, giving bitcoin a invulnerability status which is like godmode for a currency. (if you are new and don't undestand this, miners compete for hashrates, and if more miners come into the game, the difficulty adjusts. when there are many nations mining trying to increase their budgets no single nation can do a 51% hash-rate attack anymore, even if they planned to use all their energy to mine bitcoins, which they won't) so, when there is physically not enough energy left to get 51% of hash-power for a single entity in the world, bitcoin should be indestructible at that point from a hashrate perspective. correct me if I talk bs ;)

in bitcoin there is "distributed-ness" on many levels, including governance. bitcoin only works because quite a few pillars of the consensus mechanism work together. if one really wants to act up, he usually forks off, I think this happened with bcash and might happen again with sw2x. ultimately it relies on people being informed about technical solutions of technical problems, this is what bitcoin was always about, but it gets more political in the future as it grows. ultimately only mass applied ignorance could bring bitcoin down, like if 50% of the community thought technical solution A was better than B, without being able to bring up good technical arguments for their opinion - much like how religion works btw, and we now even have a bunch of people citing every little comma the bitcoin inventor messiah ever said, as if he wes the son of god ;) so yeah, there are idiots on all sides, and if they become 51% of the network, they could do a 51% idiot attack ;)
TLDR: bitcoin can fork yes, but the fork is only dangerous if the underlying dispute has almost an equilibrium of 50% in technical reasons for being for-, or against it. thankfully deciding on whether to scale on-chain or off-chain is highly in favor of scaling off-chain for pretty obvious technical reasons. so even if big-blockers want to fork, 90% of the community will not follow and they just waste resources (time, money, nerves)
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:30:40
I already wanted to write an article about it, I have a theory that they are trying to condition the market (conditioning, psychology) - if they get it right 5 times in a row (which could become true based on their market influence and "nimbus" they posses, to self-fulfill prophecies) they can use the 6th time to predict something catastrophic or a price of $10, and scoop app most of traded coins for almost nothing - of course this does not matter for hodlers, but who will hodl down to a price of $10 or even $100, $200? $500?

sure, but what miner would want to risk it? nobody knows how many millions of btc have not been converted to bch and will be dumped once the price rises a little, or a lot. I think many bitcoiners are just holding their bch and wait for some miner or investor to pump bch so they can get a better price for their bch when dumping, this is the only reason to still hold it at this point imho
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:53:18
RiP 1 CPU 1 vote, PoW change to the rescue? luke jr has one coded up already. who's with me? make bitcoin decentralized again? imho all these political debates and stalling and shenanigans would be prevented if we were close to 1 CPU 1 vote, as in that case, hashrate majority would and should decide without much fuzz. currently "the longest chain" does not depict a balanced image of what miners want, because of bitmain's dominance. it's more like what bitmain wants. on the other hand, a PoW change might scare the markets and lead to less protection from hashrate? but really do we want protection from someting rather centralized? I don't want protection from the mob or something ;)

they are a bunch of altcoin pumpers and hype/fudsters, led by a guy who does not even understand how bitcoin mining works on a technical level - they don't care about bitcoin, but profits from fud and altcoin speculation based on this fud. at least this is my impression after having been part of it for quite a while and then realizing what bs it is they spread there. it all started with the blocksize and they would not understand that big blocks lead to unacceptable amounts of centralization in the bitcoin network. now they are anti bitcoin, since they are still using big blocks as their main argument and garnish it with conspiracy theories. so it is safe to disregard them completely

there really is no natural high, the only thing slowing down bitcoin from exponential word-sprad right now is saturation effects, and currency saturation in bitcoin will not happen anywhere near or below $100k a coin, but maybe starting at $1m a coin. I think the speculators and opportunist jump on ship wave brought us to $2-3k, but the next wave will consist of people actually understanding bitcoin and throwing much much more money at it than the prior wave, we might see 10k way earlier that anyone expects, and then some - might have to do that we get segwit way earlier than anyone thought, but it's not all about segwit of course

at this point, everyone having access to (almost) free energy is basically wasting money by not mining bitcoin or some altcoin. people have been arguing against wind and solar energy because of lack of energy storage, now well d'uh now you can convert electricity into money directly. I an really quite surprised that this is not how the EU with so much excess wind power at peak times is not using this exact peak energy mining bitcoin. does not even matter if you take outdated miners..someone please tell them ;) how hard is it o automate this process so only excess energy will be used = less waste.

@_date: 2017-08-17 20:05:05
many think that miners and the guys behind r/btc are financing "spam" on the blockchain, with relatively little effort you can create lots and lots of trasnactions for very low fees which basically make the network look congested, they then use this to call bitcoin broken and hope for altcoin gains they are invested in. there is nothing to be worried about, I think I even read somewhere that miners start to figure out obvious spam transactions and process them later than others, not sure about this though. also I think all this will get harder when segwit activates, as it reduces the possibilities to game the system, one of which was this pesky Asicboost thing...good times ahead, ignore the fud, bitcoin will scale without becoming less decentralized.

@_date: 2017-08-15 17:02:27
meh, no, people know they are not supposed to hold bitcoins on exchanges, also, if you trade, you basically expose your bitcoins to the risks involved with fiat currency features like centralization and 3rd party trust. as andreas antonopolous always said: quick in quick out. if any of these go bust, you'll see traders coming here complaining they lost bitcoins trying to multiply their amount on some 3rd party service that requires to own your bitcoins to allow you to speculate on them. well, trader risk, you got to price that in to your trades. thankfully exchanges going bust happens not every day, so if it happens the exact day YOU do a trade and you lose money, that is really bad luck then, but the risk is still acceptable.

its not about the single unit price, it is about how many you can get into a building without maxing out the power you can get into this buidling. look up youtube for chinese bitcoin mines, they are like DIY server farms ;) of course cooling is another issue. that being said, competition to chinese bitcoin mining (done a little more professionally) is the best that can happen to bitcoin. not sure how much you make with your business right now, but if you can keep your data-center AND expand it with a bitcoin mine, keeping the same contract for free electricity, you can make a nice extra and help the network

don't outright lie, remind the miners if they continue their dangerous chain hopping game, they might cause all of mining community to lose their ASICs and totally decentralize bitcoin mining again. (PoW change)
tell them they have two jobs (actually three)
* be greedy and earn juicy block rewards
* be happy that there are even juicy fees
* be thankful you get paid so much for **protecting** the network
hash-hopping to some altcoin with no use, for a quick buck in profits, is **NOT** protecting the network, it just shows they are an opportunist bunch (at least the ones that switch, leaving BTC at 50% original hashpower until BCH does it's prank difficulty readjustment) and will SOLELY mine whatever is most profitable to them! but yeah, who can blame them, the whitepaper expected them to be incentivized solely by greed, I just thought they were smarter and would choose to **protect** their investment by mining the chain with the most economic support, because exactly this economy pays *their* bills and makes for *their* profits
disclaimer: I don't want to put all miners into a bad light, there are miners who understand the importance of protecting the network and stick to the chain so that there will be surely a tomorrow with SHA-256 - but not all miners, maybe even less than 51% of hash power seems to be more greedy than smart Oo. what if some new huge mining operation comes in just when bitmain left to mine bch-junkcoin and decides to 51% attack original chain? that means bye bye SHA-256 and bricks thousands if not millions of A9 miners and basically every single SHA-256 ASIC miner out there.

I've read the article, and there was nothing substantial, not saying that I expect proof before regarding any evidence, just saying the evidence is thin and it could just be a high net worth individual (and there are quite a few with man thousands of bitcoins in their stashes) doing a little gambling, or maybe even trying to influence the markets. one thing though that makes me think bitcoin price really is not manipulated, is by removing the mtgox trading bot prices of 2013 and all we get is a perfectly regular exponential curve, one that is expected from a new technology without competition, catching on and then saturating the currency market at some point.
imho this kind of "crazy" growth right now must be normal, bitcoin is finally catching on and maybe even going viral, it could take us weeks or months to even get to crazy 100k levels, at which point the growth rate should be linear and slowly fading into logarithmic towards 1m and 10m - yes this sounds crazy, but there is little to speak against it going down exactly like that - especially since we will have dealt with bitcoin's biggest criticism by soon activating segwit: "it can not scale"

yes bitcoin usually spikes when there is a little uncertainty in the world or some local crises, I overheard someone explain how bitcoin behaves in roughly three scenarios:

I think most altcoins will lose value in comparison to BTC over the next few years. you really have to reinvent the wheel if you want to compete with BTC's main app: trustless money. maybe there will be companies like the eth foundation which, inspired by crypto, will do something new and find some success, but I highly doubt its longevity. unless highly sophisticated fud and pumpgroups take over, and hordes of people self-fulfill some false prophecy, bitcoin will wreck them all :)

what, tech is solid, decision making is solid, it is a humongous novelty and worth the risk, sure there are these battles regarding censorship and block size, but also it is the best store of value with the smallest possibility of corruption, and let's face it, corruption is even involved in "finding" the price of gold, and the USD and all fiat currencies are born in sin if you will...so, what's the big deal? Bitcoin is here to stay if you ask me, or, at least crypto in general, or, to be more specific, crypto with the aiming at decentralizing power structures of our world, Bitcoin is as decentralized as it gets for now, I would not be too surprised it single governments started to back their currencies with it, that bein said, the first one who dares that, will gain a huge capital boost by soaring Bitcoin price. others might follow or lose out.

that's the genius of its design I guess. as a government if you don't start your own mining operations, you might lose out cause others already are mining. and china is not going to destroy bitcoin (malicious hashrate attacks) if they can get an edge over other countries by hoarding a bunch of the many btc they mine NOW, before other countries outcompete them with more hashes. so game theory could play out in a way as you described, countries competing with each other in mining bitcoin, while - as a genius side-effect - securing and unwittingly playing into the hands of the most secure and fair global value system there ever was. who would have thought this would be possible, it all seems within reach now. my biggest criticism on bitcoin in the last couple years wasn't even scaling, it was mining centralization. I would not be surprised to see bigger semiconductor brands, allocating resources to bitcoin mining development and governments starting a virtual arms-race to get an edge in future crypto based global economies. sounds like science fiction to you? who would have believed anyone claiming cnbc would call bitcoin too big to fail 2 years ago?

bitcoin is a key technology like the internet. the only difference: someone found a way to tokenize and put a price tag on this new key technology. no imagine if someone found a way to tax or put a price tag on the utility of the internet as a whole. what market cap would it have? if you think the internet's ideal market cap is somewhere in the trillions, maybe tens of trillions of USD, you might as-well attribute that kind of value to bitcoin, as it is a very similar key technology, and its appeal stems from its utility and technical features. right now its main app is as a store of value, but it will become cash too, albeit on a sub-level, which makes sense. anyways, if you don't understand why people hold on to their bitcoin, you should do a little more research on why it has value, and what kind of advantage it has over maybe alt-coins, which I don't even see as competition to bitcoin, but the subject is rather complicated to understand it surely helps to watch every video andreas antonopolous ever released on bitcoin, it answers 99% of all your questions. to round this post off: I think bitcoin has a potential market cap of the purchasing power of all current fiat money in circulation in the world, combined. not sure what this number is, but it is probably bigger than a theoretical market cap/value of the entire internet, or somewhere in that region :)

thx, really enlightening writeup, now I finally understand why there are blocks found within seconds relatively frequently, I always wondered why, before I was thinking it is it because miners sometimes withhold found blocks and transmit them when favorable in regards to asicboost, but never quite understood how exactly one needs to game mining in order to take advantage of AB, so how exactly does this work, id one finds a block, how can he find another one within seconds? blocks are on average found every 10 minutes but I see blocks within seconds a lot, does not really sound logical that one can find a second block within seconds frequently, unless he withheld this block after finding it to later transmit a pair of blocks for some reason

everyone keep in mind the 2013 spike to $1000 was a mtgox trading bot, essentially inflating the price, if you remove this november '13 rally, you can see a perfect exponential curve for the price, this is where we're at. assuming current prices are not inflated by some bot, we are not in a bubble, 2013 was a bubble. this could just be surfing along the bitcoin saturation s-curve which might see a rather slow exponential onramp, a linear max growth phase and a logarithmic offramp, but until the offramp comes, which eventually flattens out, we might see ridiculous growths and it would be just fine...flattening out would happen in the 100k-1m region anyways, it would mean that bitcoin is the new backing currency for all fiat currencies or something ridiculous like that - we'll see

this is not how a currency works, if everyone only saves because their money keeps its value, or keeps increasing in value, you only spend it on things of high quality and durability, and on things you really need. many economists think this is bad for the economy. but it is pretty obvious it is only bad for a wasteful depreciating economy. people still want things, they will just think more about what they do with their money before buying junk, cause their money suddenly won't feel like depreciating junk anymore.

bigger blocks cause node centralization which is an attack vector to the network, banks and governments would love this. also it causes problems with block propagation and quadratic hashing problems. look these terms up you will find a lot of info. it was clear to most devs and participants from the beginning that bitcoin could not scale on-chain, distributed ledger systems have a different base-purpose than scaling to accommodate mini-purchases for something like coffee, bitcoin was inspired by bit-gold and many parts of the whitepaper were identical to bitgold afaik, the "cash" in the whitepaper was probably bad wording to differentiate from bitgold, but essentially bitcoin is digital gold. you don't use gold to buy coffee, you use something derived from gold to buy coffee - I didn't have the time to lookup these things, but watch "banking on bitcoin" documentary, it shows you how bitcoin derived from bitgold and other concepts before its inception :) (didn't have the time to do thorough research for this response)

I guess it comes all down to people gambling and/or being bored. maybe I am wrong, who knows..
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:03:15

almost there, but what we really need is to get rid of the potential fractional reserve system inside crypto, and the huge inflated market of altcoins, of which nobody knows how much it inflated bitcoin as a hype side-effect. only then we'll know how crypto is evaluated properly in terms of fiat, since so many care about the price. as a side effect the market would also mostly get rid of people caring about the price, too. adoption, sure, but rn I see no good fundamentals. so why would I adopt rn when I think every bitcoin will gradually continue to lose purchasing power, while also being well aware of the looming possibility of one actor buying up the whole supply with intermediary non-backed tokens, causing 5 digit prices, and financing this endeavor with the high chance of rising prices by his own actions and the negligence of a whole community, blind by celebrating and dreaming of lambos? give me a break. I would not be surprised if a fair valuation of efforts and achievements in the whole space rn would be around $2000 for one btc, it seems plenty and reasonable to me. yes we can go to the moon and mars, but it will all be a mirage and likely a scam if it happens too quickly, needless to say the tether thing really bothers me as it might have caused the price pendulum to get in motion, sure it could stabilize eventually, but it is a dangerous game to play if they did so.

I completely understood the relevance of the idea though, but I am also not that much of a geek and I would definitely have lost it at mtgox - not your private keys not your coins was not something many understood back then. also, I think there was no safe way to know it was a scam back then, just not enough of a community action etc.

mining is a big issue, the bigger one is people though, they hold coins and use their coin-base accounts for everything. not many people use bitcoin for commerce/purchases, but those who do even use intermediaries, many don't even interface with the network directly anymore, this is way more dangerous than anything currently. exchanges need to play a way smaller role in bitcoin for me to take it more seriously. but the reality is ppl store their shitcoins on them, they hodl bitcoins on them, and some even use it to pay others. total surveillance potential right there.

@_date: 2017-08-20 09:41:45
yes we are not mainstream, and I am starting to worry if we ever go mainstream, we might have sold out to VC like either bitmain, centralizing hashpower or blockstream, centralizing development by introducing a one way ticket as technical debt (Segwit afaik can not be undone in a later update)
we all wanted to scale this thing, maybe it would have been smarter to just not scale it and leave it as is?
I am open to thoughts on this - I was very pro bitcoin as always, also pro SegWit, but this mixed-up my opinions a little:

@_date: 2017-08-14 01:25:30
exactly what I did when I cam on board, I thought "whoa, all these alternatives and they are even faster than bitcoin" so I bought litecoin, peercoin and a bunch of others back then, damn did I get burnt, but it was money I could afford to lose..I still think a few of the early alt-coins serve a good purpose as proof of concept

miners will still get fees even when the block reward gets very low, also the price will be so high that you can finance your mining by fees, but apart from that, nobody knows how bitcoin mining will look like in 100 years, maybe times will have changed by then and we don't need money anymore anyways? the current approach with bitcoin and 2nd layer solutions is just the best way to have this evolve, I gave on chain scaling lots of thought, but it does not work long-term, you end up with all the power in the hands of the miners, and within them there is centralization happening, a lot. not within development, at least not yet. there is way less reason for conspiracy theory around core devs or blockstream, than there is against for bitmain and what they are trying to do.

market makers are trading with themselves, they push the price to their liking, then see who takes the bait, then they do some analysis to deduct whether sentiment has changed or not, then rinse and repeat. also it might be to hunt for stop/losses, when a big one hits, they change direction. the less people participate in this, the easier it becomes for them to move the markets. the easier it becomes to move the markets, the less people want to be part of it, as they keep getting rekt by these random swings, my2sat

you‘re missing the bigger picture, investing in things that work, only works for small or local businesses, as if you invest in the big corporations which already created mafia like structures amongst each other, undermines societies, democracies, cultures, ethnicities, and ultimately destroys nature.
so either you invest in your peer groups and watch strong societies emerge, or you invest in big centralized corporate intel and apple, and see everything you once believed in get washed away.
you could also invest in money that served as money for thousands of years, instead of what they force you to pay taxes with, but that‘s a different story.
once bitcoin runs on dedicated open sourced hardware, be it end user or mining level, it will have a real chance to be gold 2.0 and make big banks scared, but as long as all of the digital world is in the hands of big zionists, one better goes offline and takes care of people close to them instead of worshipping our digital altars.

yea, but bitcoin will not succeed if it consists of 95% hodlers who don't do anything to make bitcoin stand up against the planned smart-grid and the digital lockdown, cause this is how companies like intel, apple and google want to control and "lock-down" all people of the world in the long run. so depending on what open-source hardware projects emerge in the next couple years, seriously challenging the likes of the big semiconductor companies, will have a big impact on the viability of everything bitcoin. people are not using it right, right now, but who am I to judge, many people still have not quit social media and post their vanity onto instagram..
society needs to change, then bitcoin/crypto can/could become a beautiful thing facilitating global trade.
but we need a truly open decentralized internet running on truly open and non-backdoored hardware. right now most of you, and I, run bitcoin on backdoored intel chips, or closed source smart phones, that's a no-no long term.
until then, gold is the safer bet I guess..
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:19:39
yeah, central bank cancer network ;) not sure if really a thing or not, but if it is, does not mean it is bad for bitcoin. the "nwo" has been trying to implement some kind of global curency and a single state for some time. there still is a good chance bitcoin is a highly sophisticated psy-op of exactly these people to get what they want. but even if it is not, they will not outright try to destroy bitcoin, since if they could somehow overtake it covertly, we would do all their work ;) - so, they probably are waiting and trying, and only if they fail we might see their real faces and actions, but it might be too late for them as well - but then, this is all such speculation - the real question we have to ask, is one to ourselves: will we sell our coins once it became obvious the project has been hijacked, or will we prefer to get filthy rich either by destroying the (central)bankers, or by being early adopters of the new NWO global currency lol :D *conspiracy mode off - the thing is, bitcoin will most likely and ironically succeed in both scenarios whether it beats the bankers or gets hijacked...but again, all this is un-provable conspiracy theories ;) (still bullish amidst crazy gains and crazy theories here)
edit: from my technical understanding of bitcoin it is highly unlikely it is a plan that is supposed to succeed as some kind of twisted psy-op, highly unlikely, close to impossible, maybe even impossible, in this universe. :)

there is a very good chance that once governments play their next hand (banning of cash, or applying negative interest to cash (double accounting/currency trickery), in their attempt to keep the "everything-bubble" from collapsing, that people will use gold when interfacing with crypto through for example localbitcoins, completely bypassing the central banking cartel-fiat-money, be it cash, or on the books. interesting times. so will bitcoin actually introduce a gold-standard for itself, completely bypassing any fiat out there?

the internet in the current state is a privacy nightmare. and some people are working hard on turning it into a dystopian privacy nightmare ;) it doesn‘t help that more and more people create digital personas and become dependent on it. remember, if we continue down this road, then the old: „I don‘t care about standing armies, as long as I control the money supply“ turns into „I don‘t care about the money supply, as long as ai control all digital communication“.
cause really money is really just another way of communicating value.
I am currently recommending people to leave their phones home when they meet friends, it makes for better conversations without the possibility of interruptions or someone spying on you :)
remember when alex jones got all panicked about the (insert conspiracy group here) wanting to rfid chip us like cattle? well guess what, people use tracking devices far more capable than rfid chips, and even pay up to $1000 for them.

except it had a really a really big worrisome initiator (mt.gox-implosion) as the cause, not just mere over-speculation. yes going from $200 to $20000 is 100x-ing on the price, and yes it was ridiculous for such a short timeframe, so all we see now is the market trying to figure out how long this correction from crazy heights, should reasonably last, and when (not if) is the right time for the price to reach 20k again. personally I think the mt.gox disaster should cause a longer bear market than mere price over-speculation, or did anyone really lose any actual bitcoins during the last bullrun from a few of the biggest exchanges collapsing and everyone having their moneys on there? no? well then I rest my case ;)

guys, sorry for my ignorance, but what does this mean to me as a hodler of bitcoins, should I care? is there something like old bitcoins and new bitcoins now? as far as I am concerned, nothing really changed, network hashrate is good, you can still use it for anything, why the hazzle and battles? also start thinking for the average joes at some point, do they get what's going on? I have bitcoins as a hedge to global government corruption, in my opinion, if Obama decides to deliver the money to defense contractors which then deliver injustice and destruction to the world, bitcoin ought to rise, thus, leveling the injustice, maybe it's a bit naive, but hey, wasn't bitcoin supposed to be this thing that can face off global banking by creating a real alternative? anyways, I'd try to argue towards "keep calm and carry on" but I welcome you to try to have me go into panic mode and sell all my beloved few coins ;) which probably won't happen cause I only invested what I was affording to lose in case Bitcoin failed, but then again I invested in the idea what Bitcoin stood and still stands for, and for this mere Idea I am ready to potentially lose some 'money', so what's the big deal here? please explain!

agreed, but not bc of the parallels, but bc of the push to over 5k was not really organic and fueled by short liquidations  I expect it to retrace, but how far? if we ended the bear market we will stay above 4150, if we continue it, we might go to 3k or lower. best case scenario is a retrace to not lower than 4.5k which would be very bullish imho..

nope, in a highly digitalized future society, where everything depends on the networks' uptime, and everything references to itself digitally in some way, it would be easy for a virus to just change the main self referencing reference point to zero, and everything would be zero. if there is no proof of something for a currency, it is mostly self referential. with the usd many argue it is backed by oil (petrodollar) and by military strength. actually, which ever country refused to list it's precious metal or oil exports in anything other than USD, most likely got invaded, so, this is what gives the dollar value: aggression. not something I like to support.

lost private keys (which translates to lost access to bitcoin value) lock that value forever and thus add to the scarcity &amp; deflationary property of Bitcoin. they are considered as gifts to the Bitcoin community, as coins that apparently don't move for decades, are considered either as trust from a super convinced holder, and/or as lost coins, in both cases it can be seen as a donation to the whole community.
there are 1 million coins allegedly belonging to satoshi nakamoto, and they are largely considered as inaccessible or a gift of trust from the creator - most probably he lost them though, as back in the days everyone was mining them and not at all considering them being of any value, so, system acts up weird? reinstall? safe your important files before reinstall? well bitcoin app was not considered valuable back than, so you could just delete 1M bitcoins after a hd wipe ;)

afaict, people who think this is a ponzi, or think that it must fail, well, the odds are actually in their favor, but on the other hand, given these circumstances, it is absolutely understandable that the price reflects this anomaly by continually multiplying, cause merely "being here and functioning as originally intended" is already a major success.

care to elaborate? what do you mean by real world? I think the technical and principal functioning of bitcoin is more important than any economic use of it. guess what, I got myself quite a few bitcoins only because of the way it stores value, and the way it does it is really mostly technical, pretty immune to commercial and political influences. am I seeing this wrong? basically I don't use bitcoin to buy things yet, just having it to hedge against government corruption and global crises. just like gold. to buy things I still use fiat and paypal, to store things I use gold and btc.
I guess there are more like me. Of course it would be nice if bitcoin somehow could grow to become a daily global payment network in the not so distant future, but for me and for right now, I am ok with it's current state.

"china ban bitcoin" awww, it doesn't get old, does it?
and some actual info for the many newcomers on this sub (since we are seeing positive price action lately)
no country can effectively ban bitcoin mining, everyone with access to cheap or close to free electricity, and an internet connection, can mine bitcoins him/herself. this is especially interesting for people who have access to surplus energy, that otherwise would need to be converted to heat to protect the infrastructure. this is one part of the genius design of satoshi, it is basically laid out in a way that no centralized authority can ban it.

not trying to defend them, but they merely have come to senses and gave in. nothing evil about it...if I think about it, there are few words more meaningless than evil, or believe, or god, or devil ;)
UASF is a closing door for miners, when the door closes, they don't want to be left outside. they probably understand they simply serve a purpose in the crypto space, but I see no reason to condemn them for trying to game the system to their advantage. after all the whole world works like this and you were probably only born because your dad made himself look better to your mother than he actually was/is, and thus gaining an unfair advantage over other male competitors, of course women do the same with makeup and fake tits ... ok I am diverging, you get my point :)

I am supporting 2m aswell, even though I am a noob in tech specifics and it's effects, but the crying over the bus is full and similar topics is just way too intense, bitcoin is doing fine it is friggin secure by now and when you make an urgent payment, maybe even one in 1-3digit bitcoin amounts, why not pay something like a dollar for the transaction, don't be greedy guys, and remember, there is no such thing as a free lunch.
And to the night club analogies around here: guess what, one of the most overrated berlin lets guests wait in line to artificially increase the popularity of the club, with the effect of collecting even more fame and attracting more tourists.
Now I am not for attracting tourists with bitcoin, but to some people a product only has real value when it costs something, ideally when it costs a lot.
Don't get me wrong, I am not proclaiming we should do this on purpose, but the effect might be that everyone wants to use this bus now, cause apparently people are rushing into it for any reason - you can find which once you got s ticket, so to speak
This might increase the price s lot in the next months, but I also agree that the price seems to be related to transaction volume, so, I guess we should pack more people on the bus with segwit, and then hopefully work on processing more on chain stuff.
With my limited technical knowledge I am not sure how simple a hard fork block size increase really is, I read something about firmware upgrades to some non upgradable systems, and maybe there are other good reasons for nor doing it immediately or asap.
But I wanna repeat: bitcoin os fine and it is doing fine, those who are crying probably want bitcoin to grow quicker, and in thet regard I can only repeat what my grandma always tought me: good things need time and patience. most of the bad things in the world came from rushed developments or decisions.

you really only need to ask yourself one question: is bitcoin going to be dead in a couple years, or ever? to be able to answer this question you need to dig deep into how it works and what makes it valuable. the people that got us the recent dumps, are likely people who don't really understand bitcoin much, bought in for the hype and abandoned their lambo dreams, they might bring us to 2k 1k, 500, 250, who knows. chances are the smarter dudes or people who "get it" will gradually buy at these prices, like x amount each y-price-drop

it is roughly the cost of mining, my theory is that miners stop selling coins at these prices, albeit, calling them miners is a little skewed, as it is mostly china, and there bitmain. i know from past interviews that bitmain is not selling all their coins, and hodling like many others. If the cost of mining is in the 6k-range currently, then one has to assume bitmain is not selling coins for lower, which tightens supply and prevents price from crashing. what‘s really worrying about this, is that potentially bitmain could be preventing the price to drop lower by themselves, as they, with subsidiaries, control 60-80% of the total network hashrate. so again, I think the biggest chinese mining tycoon is not selling for below production cost and also props up the price, similar things happened in 2015 at a price of $200, except back then the tentacles of bitmain have not reached as far as they do today. does this mean another bull run is coming? ha, maybe, likely not though, not unless we see some more negative action, as the setup is different now. hope and hopium won‘t work now that it is very likely that the most efficient-and by far biggest- single miner entity is stashing coins and doing (price) politics on top of, and through bitcoin. I keep rcommending never to invest more than you are willing to lose, but I expanded it to “never hodl more than you are willing to lose, I have to re-expand this a third time to “bitmain should not hodl more than they are willing to lose” cause bitmain, or any centralized ecosystem participant is essentially incompatible with the basic idea of it all. so I guess I would become bullish once the big faces like novogratz, and jihan lose their shit and sell, and cause people to panic and compulsively call bitcoin dead in the process ;) the stable price is as stable as the fed trying to save the stock market, while also having to increase interest rates in order for the system not to collapse. the issue in the latter case is that close to 0 interest inflated the stock markets in the first place, completely skewing real prices of a stock in the process. the real problem with bitcoin is similar insofar nobody knows if the 100x price rise from 200 to 20000 was due to substance, or smart price politics of big actors and exchanges fueling it, personally I am only sure that ICO-hype played a big part in it, but I am fairly sure that actors like the formerly hacked bitfinex and bitmain played a big role with their decisions as well.

bitcoin was always worth how much someone else was willing to pay for it. this won't change, what will change is how motivating and convincing the arguments to buy some become. in an ideal scenario (for the price) the community keeps on focussing on the upsides of crypto while creating hype and playing down the downsides. in an ideal scenario (for the tech and development) the price keeps dropping until all the get rich quick people go really poor, sad, mad, and lose interest, so what remains is a core of crypto philosophers discussing why this has value and how to improve it. they'll develop new features and find new reasons for why this is so great and must have a much higher value, and so the next hype cycle can begin ;)

uhm, I should probably not post this here, who knows who already profiled me...anyways, I set up buy orders in $10-steps from around $400 to $10(!). the idea was simple:
a) I don't know how far bitcoin will drop
b) the network is fine, every 10 minutes a block gets added to the chain, people do make transactions.
c) thus, bitcoin will not die from the gox-crash.
so I caught the bottom, and fully bought in with the rest of the funds many months later when it fairly clear we had bottomed.
the risk of this method: exchange exposure, one needs to have fiat in the orderbook on an exchange for this to work, so you better do this is and xchange that never got hacked and got a good rep.
one can also do this manually, or just dollar cost average by time intervals. but I preferred the set&amp;forget method and it paid off quite ok.

same here, started doing the same again a few days ago, there is no guarantee it won't still go much lower, and even stay there for 1-2 years, but if it does, you should have buy-orders in place, that is, if you believe/know that bitcoin won't go away. really what it boils down to is the definition of bitcoin being dead. there was a nice meme of it around a couple days ago.

nope, don't use fb since years, never posted anything about bitcoin on it ever, yet my frontpage is full of bitcoin related ads and ICO spam...people on here told me it's because of cookies, so I should deactivate cookies now? many website require it. I think the amount of informational self determinism required on a broader scale to make bitcoin realistically viable for what it tries to be, is practically impossible to achieve, or requires many many years of education and a shift in how we use digital media. digital responsibility so to speak. I would bet my ass the big three letter agencies at least tracked IPs if not a lot more about the most wealthy crypto holders. you can't be paranoid enough in this to make it live up on its promise, I just think it is practically near impossible. anyone wanna compete with intel so they don't backdoor you?

yes you should remove them before tomorrow, or risk finding out that all the others who withdrew have their coins but coin-base does not have yours. and no it does not work if you sell, cause if during such a withdrawal of trust-event it turns out the exchange is insolvent it will probably also take your fiat and it takes you years to get your money back. exchanges should not be trusted. they are literally like banks and bankers, before any banking laws existed, except that current banks are allowed to print money out of thin air, and back in the day they had to promise the  had the equivalent in gold in vaults. now the new gold is bitcoin, and the same story could unfold. so be careful and tell this story to everyone who is interest in owning/buying/earning bitcoin. it’s essential.

sure, I was merely talking about the initial states of bitcoin, when scaling was not yet an issue, it makes sense to do scaling on a 2nd layer that deterministically needs to settle on the blockchain.
so technically what you refer to "bitcoin without blockchain" is still bitcoin with a blockchain, but the blockchain is being used less, albeit not being able to circumvented completely.
bitcoin without blockchain really is not possible, and does not make sense, but link 2nd layer functionality to this blockchain, to prevent every purchase of some coffee anywhere in the world from being recorded forever in a shared ledger is just ludicrously inefficient.

TLDR: someone stole coins from an exchange by impersonating the person the exchange owes coins to. the coins were never actually in the nominal owner‘s control in the first place. now the formal owner of the coins, who got indirectly robbed, is suing a mobile phone company for a security hack, which allowed an attacker to steal from the owner‘s custodian wallet, i.e. exchange.
wtf is wrong with people. not your keys, not your bitcoin. any and all value on exchanges can and will be taken away from you. don‘t trust, verify. don‘t store big btc amounts neither on phones, nor on exchanges, store them safely by either hardware or paper wallets in physical safes, like other things of real value, like gold.

what you describe is not what makes gold intrinsically valuable. the properties it has are suited to make it metaphysically valuable, two of the most idealistic value-suggesting properties of gold are that it seems eternal (does not oxidize) and it looks like the sun (yellow). eternity, and the sun as the all live giving force, were two very well understood and sought after concepts, which ultimately made gold valuable and sought after metaphysically, not its mere boring feature-comparison to other metals.
now use the same approach with bitcoin, and compare the delta of innovation from "old money" &gt; "bitcoin" &gt; "altcoins". if the gap between bitcoin and altcoins is way lower than between bitcoin and old money, then you'll get an idea why alt-coins likely will never challenge the throne, similar to gold and other metals by the way, there are metals that are way more useful than gold, why is iron not more valuable than gold? :)

in these situations the market leans towards long and grinding bearmarkets, the purpose of them is to train newcomers and make people get work done instead of constantly celebrating ATH's.

further, if ownership of bitcoins is circum-navigated by mere access to bitcoin, isn't the whole thing more to be put in the perspective of the likes of utilities? sounds like owning bitcoin has more to do with having access to water, or the internet, or fresh air, than storing and controlling something locally. doesn't this make this "asset" way way different than how we regularly talk about it?
nobody would ask you "do you have access to bitcoins?" "everyone would just ask "do you have (i.e. own) any?"

how about you, how well do you cover your tracks to reddit and do you know how your internet traffic is being routed? did you ever give you passport data to an exchange? have you cashed out forked coins? all these are things that can track you down, including your phone having an active microphone and sending data out to facebook, if you use their app. (happened in the past, but still worth mentioning).
my case is merely that we live in a super surveillance society and the idea of private money, is in theory correct, but in reality a mirage, bc people are not careful enough, and can not possibly be careful enough. I use a post 2009 intel cpu, and if the NSA wants to screw me, they can.

best answer right there
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:01:31
it's all just semantics, the fact is that the supply of bitcoin is limited, while the supply of USD is not, means, that once all the toxic assets of the central banks explode in their faces, you better hope you have some of the following:
guns, bitcoin, gold, silver, coherent societies, friends.
then one bitcoin might be worth trillions, even if it only buys you a lambo, a bag of flour, or a mansion, depending on context.
best case price target for one bitcoin though: "peace of mind". I wonder if and when this will be achieved, or whether it should be achieved, as if bitcoin being the only thing that gives people peace of mind would be kind of dangerous, 'peace of mind' should always come about many decentralised factors, but I digress...

crypto without chaos? sounds like bitcoin without blockchain
@_date: 2019-01-01 09:18:51
well they tried to draw public attention away from bitcoin by never using the term "bitcoin" but merely the term for bitcoin's underlying technology: "blockchain". and they hyped the big jesus out of blockchain. some companies changed their name to include blockchain and their stock would skyrocket. in the end the plot did not work as many pointed out that bitcoin without blockchain, and even blockchain without bitcoin does not make sense. the best analogy I can come up using cars would be "having a chassis without tyres", is as useful as "having tires without a chassis". so the banks would not acknowledge that the couple of core technologies, ideas and features bitcoin consists of, need to be working in tandem exactly how they do, in order to make this thing as big as it deserves to be. and banks don't want this to be big, in fact if they had found some design flaw/attack vector, that allowed them to stop people from seeking bitcoin, they would have used it. 
actually I spend 10% of my time trying to come up with ways how to stop bitcoin, and the best one I could come up with is destroying society and restarting civilisation, and that's just a ridiculous amount of effort to stop some technology.
I am already derailing this in a "why I like bitcoin rant" ;) but since we're at it:
the fact that it is so resilient, shows that the designer(s) had resilience in every kind of scenario in mind. I think the genius invention really was, to combine open-ness (public ledger) and redundancy (everyone has a copy of all transactions forever) with closed-ness (private key cryptography) while also fully taking advantage of the nature, features, freedoms and possibilities of the internet itself.
whoever designed this sht, knew exactly what hey was doing, and what purpose it needs to serve, and how much it would kick balls of people with lots of power and influence.
so really the best way how the banks and the media treat bitcoin so far is to try to not talk about it much, and since they know they can not destroy it, and not even attempt to destroy it (which would Streisand this to the moon instantly) I think what they are trying to do, is crash stock markets, cause a recession, and hopefully buy up all bitcoin at around $1000 where most people who don't have the stomach to see this thing dropping and dropping will panic-sell, or sad-sell, or rationalize-sell (to cover cost for food). then, if banks have a huge chunk of all available bitcoins, they can more effectively control and manipulate the market, to make sure it never really takes off, and if it takes off, owning 10-20% of what all people in the world use to exchange value digitally, is not too shabby either, right?
all this will fail if people don't care, hodl, and start using bitcoin without having transactions ever hit either exchanges nor banks. that's basically game-over for centralized power over money issuance, and after that there's only the dreaded nuclear option.

to be honest I did not bother researching them, but in my opinion there is only one good use for the rather inefficient tech that is distributed ledger, hash based cryptography, and it's decentralized money. smart contracts and all the bells and whistles can settle on this blockchain, but should do their work on a 2nd layer of bitcoin, if at all. as It currently looks bitcoin will only ever do money, and I really like the idea to stick to the basics. running all this and having an uptime of almost 10 years is NOT trivial. many assume it though.

y - tbh if some exchange found a way to somehow introduce a fractional reserve system to pump bitcoin, I would want their butts scrutinized by regulators and lawfirms with a microscope - and for those who think I should not cry for regulators, this is bitcoin, well no, this is not bitcoin, this is the interface between bitcoin and fiat, and I want that rather regulated, at least for centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:18:41

@_date: 2017-09-10 14:13:02
ah cmon dudes, there is nothing wrong about people suggesting the price needs to correct, it has been doubling in crazy short timeframes over the past months, and every time it wanted to correct, some magic money came out of nowhere, even on weekends and bought the dip, this, and stories around tether led me to believe the price was manipulated. the only way to find out whether some exchange used funny tokens to margin long bitcoin is to let the price drop and see if exchange stays solvent, my2sat

I was worried about the port issue for western influence as well, what can be done against it?
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:23:32
been here a long time, followed richard's sentiments very closely at each step, he never fudded, he was always dead certain on bitcoin rising. he admitted at some point though that "everything" was in a bubble, meaning stocks, real estate, money, bitcoin. his idea was to just ride the waves and milke the cow as long as she gives milk. anyways, I consider him a realist and understand his change of mind. especially after the amount of retardedness we have seen in the space. we even had to change "submit link" in the sidebar to "submit link NOT about the price" it should be revealing.
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:02:19

proof or fud?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:53:05
many here like to be silent about the fact that these guys said many times they want to shut down sketchy ICOs which in their minds are unregistered securities. this would be the end of ICO scams and even vaporware, but wasn't that the fuel that fueled at least the ethereum bubble and to some extent the bitcoin bubble? makes price discovery a rather tough job..
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:50:24

@_date: 2017-09-02 18:33:46
traders are looking for floors, this is why it pulled back: 5k had no floor to stand on stable, it is being built now around 4.5k, most likely tomorrow too, new bank wires to exchanges will clear mid next week, this is when we break 5k maybe test 6k, - SW, LN drivechain, mimblewimble will bring us very very far :) rip fiat, rip altcoins ;) never been more bullish btc then after SW activation, only real resistance is psychological at $10k, it will need multiple heavy floors to be broken through, my2sat

yeah he is, he works in my office
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:40:46
of course not, first the ICO ban, which will be withdrawn and replaced by "we will regulate it" which then turns into little if any action at at all, and very recently the mere rumor of exchanges getting closed, all to stop bitcoin to grow too fast, in a way it's good, cause it clears the way for 5k, but don't expect 5k to fall at the 2nd try, 3rd time is a charm ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:32:30
back in august (at relatively low prices) it already felt bubbly, and all I asked myself was whether we make a s-curve or repeat history with a multi year breakdown. then I found out about how tether works and how well audited they are... /s and sodled quite a bit at 4k...not that I want it to go back to 4k or even lower, but I kind of expect it. for a whole year any negative news or criticism on bitcoin has been buried in a tsunami of hype.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:36:26
*First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win*
so in what phase are we? looks like right before "then they fight you" given the china-news and the jpmorgan verbal attacks, would not be surprised for them to try to attack bitcoin further
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:40:46

I would agree, but too much adoption happing while the china fud fades...we will see 5k before we see 3k
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:09:17
is the "coming home from holidays, checking the news and what's going on in the world" still a thing? if so, I'd expect many people finding out about bitcoin in autumn after holiday season ended.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:20:52
nobody will ever ban bitcoin. here is why: you can't. and the only thing worse than trying to ban bitcoin and failing, is proving to everyone you have no power over it.
open source, open participation, permission-less internet based censorship resistant value transfer system - what do you expect? that someone starts ww3 and bombs us back to stoneage just to effectively destroy/ban bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-09-06 13:09:46
and if bitfinex would be a little more transparent on the USDT pumping shenanigans, every-time the [price drops]( and audit their books, I would not be in the least scared that (bitcoin-)history might repeat itself. bitcoin is and was working perfectly for many years, but unfortunately that's not what people care about. they care about the price, plain and simple as that, and if someone messes with the price, or price discovery, they might care about that as well - of course only if for some reason it started to keep dropping and it wouldn't stop, no matter how many USDT dollars you pump into the dip..) idk I am glad I dodged the gox bullet but I am super mistrustful about anything the only remotely smells like anything similar like the gox shenanigans - and it just so happens bitfinex has the biggest daily volume, so, is it the market maker?
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:27:31
I have in the past disregarded this as fud, but $70 million in 3 days is not ok. if the BTC price is *again* inflated, one bitcoin is probably worth less than people are willing to pay for it, this sucks and needs to be dealt with, but I have no idea how - suggestions?

no reason at all, maybe the fudsters succeeded for now, but 100k new customers in the last 48 hours on coinbase alone? that's a rocket ship, if everyone of them buys only 0.1BTC that's a lot more than miners supply in 48 hours, simple math, and as I said, that's only coinbase. bitcoin is a bitch to short or sell and make a gain, the way to make gains is to hodl, I keep trying to time the market and occasionally spread some fud too to make some gainz, but really all I get is screwed for not plain and simply hodling, that being said some of the nicest purchases I ever made was with bitcoin, it just feels so different :)
for the interested, here's the math: every 48 hours bitcoin network produces 9000bitcoins, if every new coinbase customer buys 400USD worth of bitcoin, coinbase alone would push the price up. I have no info on how much every new coinbase costumer buys on average, but I expect most to buy around 0.01 worth of bitcoin, and a few a LOT more, so on average probably around 0.1BTC - and in that case coinbase customers alone would buy all the newly minted bitcoins alone, which is unrealistic, cause demand is global and word of mouth is spreading like a wildfire, still.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:40:33

@_date: 2017-09-05 12:39:47
great explanation, sensible conclusion, but if they have been doing this for months, nobody can tell whether one bitcoin is worth $4000 or $2000 now. price discovery is all about psychology and trust in bitcoin - if word goes around that bitfinex creates assets changeable for BTC out of thin air, and combine that with the biggest exchange in volume (bitfinex) then you might demand some questions to get answered. I mean look, bitcoin survived the last price discovery hiccup, it was a trading bot at mtgox! but it took 2 years and people distrusted bitcoin or its price discovery, causing a 80% price drop - who wants that bullshit again?
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:26:51

ah man, don't, never invest more than you are willing to lose, and you are not willing to lose money for such essential things. what if some unknown bug in bitcoin shows up, and tanks the price by 50%, 75%? can you wait 1-2 years for the price to recover?
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:24:31
gosh this sub really needs a price correction to $2000 or even below to get real again and start giving sensible advice again, you know what people were sharing around here when the price was sub $1000?

@_date: 2018-03-01 12:32:12
not even state actors, spectre? intel? nsa? I really would like to see the tech that makes this totally anonymous, and I think it is impossible. if anything bitcoin will empower big tech to be the gatekeepers, unless we develop open source hardware?
I think if you want to convince me of bitcoin, we would need open source hardware, decentralized exchanges, and responsible people using this new form of real value. I just think people rn are not at all familiar with the concept of real value. our modern societies do everything to mitigate risk to 3rd parties, essentially taking away all your responsibilities. I wonder how and if insurance companies would ever insure bitcoin holdings...so many questions
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:45:15
the real issue about having access to so much money is not about money but power. imagine bitcoin was worth $1m, everyone uses it, markets rely and depend on it, and then it turns out one guy has access to more than 10% of it all non-lost bitcoins...he could basically extort the whole world and coronate himself king of the world. even more so, what if this guy was some government entity? the origins and original intentions of the bitcoin project are speculative, just as the asset itself.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:22:37
community cares way too much about the price, and that in itself is a problem, because if enough people care about the price, all it means is that if it drops too far, it will cause others to sell and cause an avalanche that stops only at a price where core hodlers hold. mass psychology at work. so, it means increased volatility. I call this scared money or uninformed money, and it is a little worrying how many people bought 50/50 ETH/BTC without understanding anything about any of those coins...(other than price keeps doubling every month, d'uh) I'd be surprised if these people hold their assets once it drops 20%, 25%, 50% - we'll see.

yeah, I really don't like the potential for massive manipulation either. sure everyone suggests just to hodl, but why do I even care for the price when some people can initiate a 2yr bear market if they decide to..price discovery is a bitch. the only way to protect yourself from it is having stop loss orders on exchanges, but that defies the purpose of bitcoin as bitcoin is not meant to be held by 3rd parties (exchanges). and this is why people always assume bitcoin will go either to the moon or to 0, nothing in between.

I sure expect so, but bitcoin will not die from this. what could state actors attacking bitcoin mean for bitcoin price? well, a valley of months to years, but it will recover, exchanges are not bitcoin, also an important lesson for newcomers to learn.

[the amount of professionalism though](
I think this needs more discussion and scrutiny, of course nobody wants to ruin the party as long as the price is rising, right? but everyone needs to understand exactly how this USDT thing works and what potentials it holds for fraud and market manipulation - I certainly don't want to profit from a ever rising bitcoin price when it could turn out it was pumped with non-backed USDT which later became backed by a price-rise, you see, it's circular, it is the epitome of a self-fulfilling prophecy. I would have no problem if this happened by some entity that just simply pumps real BTC into bitcoin and makes the price rise - ever noticed that bitfiniex constantly has the highest volume by far? I demand answers, balance sheets and audits now, and you should too.

thank you china, you will lead the way to decentralize bitcoin, cut off one head of the hydra, and 5 new ones grow :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:56:09
lol, 100k new customers on coinbase alone in the last 48 hours, they don't just join to have a shiny new internet money account, they want bitcoins. do the math, we'll see $4.5k and likely new ath at $5k way before we ever touch 3k again :) china news is overrated and the bottom line is: more decentralization, which is exactly the kind of news I have been waiting for to go into bull-mode again.
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:20:32
nah' if this holds true we will see accelerating gains over the next few weeks/months, people will scream "bubble" and all it would be is an adoption s-curve, which usually happened with facebook and google, only no mortal was allowed to invest in them so early on. - so not remindme 10 years, but more like 3-6 months ;)
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:18:36
for everyone considering selling, it is way too late and risky to sell now, damn if I had more fiat I would somewhat buy now, absolutely no reason out there for a drop this big, and if you think china banning ICOs means anything, good luck buying back higher ;)
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:51:47

when was this 2010?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:09:52
it will recover, either from 8k, 5k, 3k, 1k, or after the bitfinex/tether thing is sorted out. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:03:10
I am bullish long term on BTC. but this is far from over. the tether issue is not solved, there is an ongoing investigation about it. then there is the altcoin bubble that needs to pop hard. who would trust this space after the retardedness we've seen from youtubers? even more so when you combine tether and altcoin market-trends, you get a good picture of what might have been going on in the past year. if you think altcoins grew organically, think again.

@_date: 2017-09-02 18:54:02
you like iron hands? guess who scooped up bitcoin falling to $200 in the months after bitcoin's 911 (mtgox) ;) you only need to ask yourself one question when in doubt about the cause of a falling price: will bitcoin die from this? if the answer is no, buy, if it is yes, stay away. I was 99% sure bitcoin would not die from mtgox, it literally had nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol itself, still many sodl, and I set up cascaded buy orders on an exchange and went away for a couple months ;) still risky, but bitcoin is high risk high reward, this will change over the years to either high risk no reward, or low risk low reward, I hope for the ladder, but that will be at prices way over 100k per btc.

I would not recommend people to sell now, but I would recommend to wait until worthless altcoins die and tether properly gets audited..I would also wait until the space finds some modesty instead of hyping people up about prices and the market. of course you got more USD worth of bitcoin than you are willing to lose, sell, but make sure you don't sell into USDT, and don't sell everything.

I understand this, I am just saying it l makes no sense. it is due to people investing without thinking, and if some ICO mumbo jumbo fails or gets banned, people cash out to fiat instead of BTC, as it is all the same to them, but it isn't. also, bitcoin is a ton less speculative than other cryptos. but who cares, people just put money into top 10 of crypto and cash out to fiat if something happens to 'crypto' it's just stupid reasoning, makes no sense. but it explains why the btc price is dropping as well even if there's 0 technical correlation. I call it 'stupid money' :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:06:05
I'm testing zap wallet on a mac, it seems like it is downloading the blockchain in the background, yet I can't find the folder it puts it - on another machine I have the whole blockchain (running a btc node) - how are implementations handling blockchain and remaining in sync? will they find the folder that I chose for my full-node and use it instead of downloading the chain into a different folder? would be a waste of space, time, and cpu cycles.

I don't ignore it, I know about this being a potential issue, but I also don't make any assumptions about it, cause no data. so if anyone warns and fuds, instead of neutrally informing about the mere possibility of it, I get kinda annoyed and call it out.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:24:14
buy a little when it's low, buy a little when it goes lower, buy a little more when you think it can't go lower, but a little when it rises, buy a little more when it keeps rising, buy all that you formerly sold so you still make a profit when it keeps rising. bottom line, always buy a little. and sell when it looks like it goes to the moon, in hindsight, props to everyone selling at 19k...but who would have thought, everyone was already envisioning lambos ;) so maybe when you start thinking about lambos instead of worrying whether to sell or not, you should sell, and when you worry about price dropping further, probably buy.

idk, if the market keeps distrusting bitfinex as the biggest exchange in the space, alledgedly pumping altcoins with unlimited usdt from their primting press, then it might even go sub 1k. I would hate to see it as I am hodling....but not planning to cash out anyways..others might want to sell and buy cheaper.

lol ICOs, what does this have to do with bitcoin? you think some premine goldrush coin with ICO bulge is somehow connected to bitcoin just because they use that meaningless buzzword 'crypto' for it? people don't understand bitcoin and that's why they buy altcoins, cause they assume it must have similar validity as bitcoin, since they also use 'blockchain' another meaningless buzzword. so, for insiders and people who get it, it is certain this is a non-event for bitcoin, similar to 'china bans bitcoin' for the n-th time. but yeah, if you assume that 'crypto' is a meaningful common denominator for all cryptocurrencies, putting something like bcash or ethereum or dash into the same boat as bitcoin, well then yeah, but it is absolutely wrong to do so imho, I guess I'm a bitcoin maximalist, but I also think there are conceptually 0 reasons for multiple blockchains. censorship resistant money is already the most efficient and most suitable application for a couple of cryptographic technologies making for what we call bitcoin - altcoins are kinda doomed to miss that sweetspot or not to innovate enough to be able to compete long term, and in the special case of ethereum, a blockchain is too inefficient and needs to be replaced by some centralized alternative like a database, and at that point nobody would put it in the 'crypto' bag anymore, would you? guess why china can ban ICOs but not bitcoin?

the effects of this property only applies when there is no more fiat currencies, before that the controllers of fiat money can just print useless fiat and invest in crypto, inflating crypto price. the problem with inflation is control. if you control what people deem valuable, and make sure you ha e unlimited amounts of it, you debase every value others deem valuable. as long as the usd is the predominant world currency, it will debase crypto just like everything else that is predominantly priced by it. have you never wondered why people are so obsessed with the usd value of their crypto? they should not be, they should be doing commerce with crypto without ever interfacing with any fiat, but this is not happening as crypto has no closed economic loops, like there is no crypto going to farmers for produce, maybe if the fiat and dollar empire collapses farmers will use sheets of papers with hidden private keys or maybe monsanto takes over farming and centralizes it globally, by then we’re in deep shit :)

isn't it ironic, a most centralized exchange, acting like a bank in the bitcoin ecosystem  finances something like this, instead of a decentralized "community" of holders and old-coiners? makes me think we try to replace the system we are fighting with a slightly worse system, bc of convenience. or do the 5 biggest bitcoin exchanges not pose a huge thread to the bitcoin decentralization model? how many ppl anyone around here know anyone who exclusively bought bitcoin anonymously or mined them?

no, education and responsibility are key. forget the custodians. bitcoin was designed to incentivize people to grow up and take responsibility for their actions by securing their very own money. if bitcoin will fail at this, it will also fail as a project. if people don‘t change and keep entrusting others with their values, then they should not wonder that everything good from democracy to music gets eroded and loses its value. it‘s really all about self-responsibility. you can not double check a bitcoin address? you should not be allowed to vote, or own money. people have the choice now to either get concerned about data security, or lose everything they believe in and trust, as the current digital ecosystem we live in, is absolutely rigged and surveilled.  I‘d even go as far as saying if something like facebook survived long term, then something like bitcoin won‘t, long term. facebook is all about exposing your data, and bitcoin is the exact opposite. bitcoin says data is unique and precious, facebook says data is abundant and worthless, so send me all your pictures so I can track and control you. go figure. we are at a crossroads with this new tech, it‘s not just about money, it‘s about a complete mindshift in how we treat information. and all this within the age of information. if you ppl don‘t start to change how you interface with bitcoin, I‘ll stay bearish, and I know quite a few idiots who just don‘t care and just hodl their coins on coinbase. wtf. if this continues, bitcoin will have failed.

make sure you don't attract too much attention, I hope you are using a throwaway reddit account - also make sure you back up and encrypt everything, consider moving your coins to a different wallet, a hardware wallet to be safe from compromised hardware (windows pcs and everything connected to the internet) really just the usual. with so much mo' you need to change they way you treat money and who you tell it to. ideally you don't tell to anyone, keep a low profile, until you figured out how to live the live of a rich person without getting ripped off or robbed left right and center..idk, sounds like you won the lottery, there are bad things happening to these people as they are not used to so much money. also consider donating a chunk of it too people in developing countries maybe. once you figured all out, try not to get stressed too much about this money. but again: try to disconnect your identity from this kind of money as well as you can. even coming to reddit with a throwaway but not through a VPN or even TOR is not very smart. go underground maybe, but keep a low profile. you only really mastered the art of being rich when nobody really notices that you are rich imho ;) oh and if this advice was helpful, consider donating 10btc to this address :D

in the end I think it's about what is healthier for bitcoin long term, I think a pretty long bear market to get the lambomoons out of the market is not just good for financial establishments, but overall for the whole space. I would also like to see many funny altcoins die, and they won't unless we go into a really deep swamp pricewise. personally, I think the time to buy back is when the lambomoons lost interest in bitcoin or crypto for that matter (despair). not sure if it happens though, cause general awareness on crypto is still pretty high, so there is a slight chance we see another hypetrain, at least this is what the lambomoons hope - really liking the term "lambomoons" well done :)

a hodler bets on the possibility bitcoin will be worth more USD at a later time, not that bitcoin prevails, the common hodler does not even know what bitcoin is about, and can not verify the core values of bitcoin as a currency to be intact. common hodlers don't care about things like mining centralization, exchange centralization, exchange market manipulation, and coin possession centralization. what they really care about is gambling and FIAT, while using bitcoin or crypto in general merely as a tool for their potential gains.

everybody with enough fiat, or enough fiaUSDT - but I have no data to support any claim that exchanges rule the crpyto markets via manipulation - but it would be safe to assume since they could make money on the way up and on the way down more reliably than their customers.

you miss my point, I am saying bitcoin is useless when dumbed down. why not use paypal? it‘s even quicker and has anti fraud protection. if you dumb down bitcoin far enough it loses all its nice features like trustlessness, permissionlessness, decentralization, private money, etc. .
my argument is that bitcoin is as valuable as the way people use it. is the internet valuable? well,any people I know use it to kill time, instead of educating themselves.
we need a mind-shift for this to become a success, price means nothing, they can trade it up and down via futures and etfs, but it means nothing, bitcoin will have made it once closed economic circles happen on it. like farmers accepting it and getting paid without interfacing with any central authority in the process. and then pay others for a laptop with the same money, and the laptop seller pays someone else who the  pays the framer again.
all this without amazon, google, NSA, the clinton’s, weinstein, and apple. on open source dedicated payment hardware, without intel or amd backdoors.
everything else could get worse for the masses than it is rn. that being said, I‘ll become bullish again once we start filthy rich bitcoin hodlers like „loaded“ start to fund hardware companies to produce open source payment hardware, guaranteed backdoor-free.
all this etf and suck up to the powers that be hype is just sad.

this is only the beginning, mark my words. watch what happens once people figure out Bitcoin is - right at this moment - setting the record straight in terms of decentralization and core values! it is literally un-breaking itself. was it broken before? some argued it was, because it would not scale, and because miner centralization is too high. but guess what: it is currently serisouly and ferociously being dealt with. by whom you might as? users. yes, grassroots user revolt haha .)
--&gt;UASF for progress! this is it guys! you have been waiting for this. and now you can even take part in it - consider running an UASF# node, be glad we regular joes can afford to run nodes on our home PCs! its one of Bitcoin's best features!

@_date: 2017-05-29 23:00:14
oh we can be strong and community all day, it does not mean anything. if you are in Bitcoin for a financial gain, cause maybe you have seen prices double and triple every year, then you are a speculator, and a tourist :D
if you are in this because you think decentralized trust- and permission-less money will change the world, then you are right on.
if you are in this because you know what it is that gives Bitcoin value, then you should try to figure out how you can help to make sure it retains its value by doing the right thing and not chicken shit out :D
I am pretty sure there are quite a few newbs totally baffled by what's going on in Bitcoin right now, on one side the price rises because of all the new people flocking to it, on the other hand people have fears like the one you mentioned.
if by august 1 the price should dip, it would just mean that the scared people take their profits and buy back later - which is viable as it minimizes risk, but, you could also lose out big time because if Bitcoin gets those much needed upgrades, it will just skyrocket, and you might be late to the party, cause other speculators are already waiting for positive buy signals...
so whatever you do, don't let it be commanded by fear or panic, be it buying or selling, if any of these emotions are involved, it usually turns out not so well. if you bought BTC recently and want to make sure it retains and multiplies it's value, consider finding out why running a node at your home and using it to transact, is good for bitcoin - once you understand what's going on and how you, everyone of you and me, are in charge of Bitcoin, you don't need to be scared anymore and can just lean back and watch it gain value vs USD and other fiat currencies :)
remember, communities manifest around ideas, not the other way round :) and the idea of Bitcoin is a rather simple but radically different one than most other currently active ideas in the world - and it's expressed in technology!

@_date: 2017-05-20 00:52:57
if exchanges, wallet providers and payment processors see how many humble UASF nodes are running, they are more likely to speak out! so don't be humble, this is a grassroots movement and will probably go down in history as the time when bitcoin users have had enough and chose to act for change. if bitcoin moons right after, you can tell your kids one day you helped humanity to break free from financial slavery :D
if for some reason SW will not work (unlikely) or the bitcoin core group turns out to be the evil villains that this other fake-bitcoin fanclub called r/btc shouts out so loud, then we are all screwed, but hey, even the most conservative ones would say it is a 51% chance SW is the best way to go by august 1st. personally I think it is more like a 95% chance.

also: once people start exclusively circlejerking over how great and vast the roman empire they live in is, instead of what makes it so great, what it's core values are, that is the perfect sign for a bubble, and the empire will collapse! :) I refuse to help in bubble-making, price posts are some kind of circle jerk, or posts like "I am so glad I can tell my buddies they were wrong, see the price now?" price is a result of some underlying principle, I don't know why you are mad, tell me..

mine too about 2 hours ago, main motivation: stop the asicboost 2000% profit edge for jihan. it is an absolute fucking disaster that this is a thing, and it needs to stop. but there were many motivations to it and have been thoroughly weighing pros and cons for a long time before coming to the conclusion this is the thing to do.

and all this only by increasing the block size, which will totally not increase the danger of a state-actor to attack and control Bitcoin  nodes, making your coffee purchase no different than making a bank transfer.. /s
we have two problems right now with Bitcoin:
* miner centralization
* usage increase / popularity
you propose solving the latter with uncontrolled blocksize increases, which leads to Bitcoin having two more severe problems:
* miner centralization
* node centralization
it does not take a genius to figure that having two pillars of the Bitcoin decentralization seen sacrificed, being a disaster
would you agree that we have to fire the miners and change PoW? if you think the value of Bitcoin lies in one of its use cases, rather than its principle of decentralization, then we disagree diametrically.

nope, altcoin market is insanely inflated with 'stupid' money, reasoning: new users neither understanding Bitcoin nor altcoins, hedge Bitcoin holdings with random altcoin purchases. new users still need to learn Bitcoin is safe haven, and will panic sell alts when that bubble pops. I expect $4-6.6k Bitcoin pre Segwit, and beyond 10k, after. all this only without any major exchange popping under heavy load nor any other semi catastrophic bad news like a new gox. it is very unlikely though, the Wild West times in Bitcoin are gone, space has matured a lot, and people have been warned repeatedly not to leave their coins on exchanges, so they should not cry

how to on mac:
create a textfile with textedit, paste "uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148" in this file, and save it to /Users/"yourusername"/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin
(this is also the place where your wallet and the whole blockchain is saved!)
after that, rename the file to bitcoin.config
restart your bitcoin qt!
if you want to help the cause in a more drastical manner, like with an integrated deadline for august 1st (don't worry, it is all safe) expressing your strong opinion that this inflated fee market and making miners crazy rich must end (so they only get rich, not crazy rich) then consider running the BIP148 binaries themselves, not just signaling - this is equivalent to going all in on Bitcoin with SegWit - be sure you understand Segwit, it is an important decision and everyone who understands it and supports it, is basically writing history by running it. something to tell one's kids about one day.
for osx choose the dmg -  scroll down where it says "Where do I download software that enforces BIP148?" there you go, but be sure and get informed, otherwise we are no better than the BU guys who just argue with conspiracy and personal attacks, they have no real arguments against SW everytime I check their sub :)

this is ok! - but consider buying what you really need, if your fortune in bitcoin came from the idea of owning and using sound money, then don't be surprised if you start making sound financial decisions!
I had this theory of the spirit of money for a long time, and I think big parts of our society are poisoned because at the base there exists this fiat-money-inflation-fountain, which devaluates everything we save and everything we do. and thus we buy shit we don't need for people we don't like: ourselves. (whoa that was unintentionally deep)
I have my hopes up, that with sound money at it's base, people as a whole make better buying decisions, and who knows, maybe Apple will start building phones that last 10 years once we pay for it in Bitcoin - instead of 2 years - and not force you to update to the newest version that slows it or makes it a brick?
edit: oh and about the car...a small fiat is not very safe in terms of airbag, maybe consider some volkswagen for your own safety, in traffic, there only needs to be one idiot to kill a few others..

"People don't expect the value of money to increase in value over time"
aha, you know when all coins are mined and the adoption stabilizes on a global mass adoption, the value of bitcoin will not increase more than the value of gold, and btw, the value of gold is not and has not ever increased or decreases, but the value of the fiat moneys surrounding it, and being speculated with, decreased!

I'd love him becoming part oft he community again, he should try to avoid the spotlight though, maybe a role as a silent holder who secretly runs a bip148 node without anyone taking notice? the people that I respect the most in Bitcoin, are the ones I rarely hear anything about, cause they are constantly busy writing first class code and have an engineering and idealist interest in the success of this thing..oh what an irony, the heroes of my past, getting replaced by selfless nerds and idealist cryptographers :D interesting thought to add to this: could it be that Bitcoin is only trustless if you are a cryptographer/coder? cause how many of you holders and users have actually ever checked any of the binaries it runs on? :) just a thought
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:24:37
been thinking about this too. but what's the alternative to make the point with? buying fiat as a protest  against centralization? does not make lots of sense there.. the question is, which coin (altcoin space) is the most decentralized one and otherwise closest to Bitcoin, IF you wanna go that route..

I think many fall into this category..
anyways, I would not even trust an insurance, you know Bitcoin was most likely invented to do away with banks, and relying on the legal system in case coinbase operators decide to buy a small country with their customers BTC deposits is really brave.. ;) also, since the legal system is, as most things, influenced and based in the legacy banking system, you are relying on a bank to protect your deposits ;) why not use a bank in the first place?

a HF without any technical necessity, and especially a rushed one is reckless. to all the newcomers around here: a HF in bitcoin is not as easy to pull off as it is in a altcoin! (can someone please explain in technical detail why it needs to much time btw? thanks) it needs to be prepared for almost a year in advance to be 100% safe! softforks are easier
(anyone correct me if I am not 100% accurate here)

I have this trace of hope that maybe the whole scaling deadlock will eventually be solved by mining competition. other countries ramping up hashrate - maybe even subsidized by governments - and competing in mining, to lessen the stranglehold of the jihans of this world on this shiny new technology we all like so much. activating SW would be way less risky if jihan would only have 20% or less of hashpower. maybe producing in china is already the most cost efficient, cause of labor costs and such, but cmon, you don't wanna tell me Intel could not make a better bitcoin miner than jihan, for intel (or AMD for that matter) it would be like stealing candy from a kid, a comparison not that far off in this case if you ask me.
I wonder how profitable it would be for major well known chip manufacturers with their nice tiny nanometer manufacturing processes, to enter bitcoin mining, I guess if the price is not a signal for them to just do this then I don't know what is...

in layman's terms, it enables you to be as close to the network as possible and 100% sure nobody can screw you over a bitcoin transaction, technically speaking. also, it sends out a message of what propocol development you want, there are many different nodes one can run, most usually just run a core node and be good with it, but currently there is a scaling debate, and the technically best solution is being blocked by "big blockers" a bunch of people funded by other people who don't want to lose their incomes in a flaw of how bitcoins are creates (asicboost) and high miner fees. they pretend to have a cause, but really they just want to stall and do nothing, as the status quo is very lucrative to them, bottom line, Bitcoin is stallin in progress, because of politics.
running a node helps create awareness from an user perspective, that we don't want stalling anymore.

jep, makes sense - I still think bitcoin needs to be the decentralized backbone for crypto, or all of crypto becomes corrupted. yes, not everyone has an interest in being part of some kind of revolution, and most revolutions end up shut down anyways by the powers that be...but with bitcoin, many have the hopes up it will cause a landslide change in our world, and it is being attacked for this already on all sides - afaik ethereum is set up way less centralized to bitcoin, but if bitcoin can not overcome its stalling, it might fade or become a corporate brand/label. not saying this will drop its value in usd, it just means the dollar equivalent of a bitcoin may become more important than the idea bitcoin represents. if this idea became hollow, the dollar would have won ;) - and we would never reach moon ;)

@_date: 2017-05-26 16:35:28
we'll see, non malicious miners are not so shortsighted though. also, every miner who does not profit from asicboost will mine BIP148..the current upward momentum is not something one needs to protect, one needs to fuel it with positive change.
price goes up cause Bitcoin is still Bitcoin, but it will go exponential if Bitcoin becomes even more Bitcoin. how is that possible? well, more decentralization, less miner asicboost cheating, more features. scaling to accommodate more users without sacrificing decentralization!
you sound a little scared, or cowardly, idk, what is your skin in the game? the good of Bitcoin overall and ultimately your wallet long term, or the good of your wallet short term?

you have to imagine "them" as your older brother, you sit with him in the same boat, he is a little more skilled than you when it comes to scheming and plotting, you on the other hand are a nerd and super talented in programming and engineering! you have the better solution for all the fish that you are catching, business runs well! but he has a solution that would make him very very rich and powerful, and you don't even want that, you just want the best implementation implemented to store all these fish and deal with them, but his solution implements a trick to sell the fish for way more than it is worth, cheating the buyers! also since you can barely see behind his scheming, framing and stalling tactics, you keep on discussing with him, trying diplomacy - in short, you are weak, but right, he is strong, but wrong.
UASF now is the way to enforce dealing with the fish in the best possible and fairest way while also staying fair to the customers!
and now the climax of my little story: the customers can run UASF on their PCs and Macs, actively deciding that there should not be no dirty tricks in fishing business and no hidden ingredients to inflate price!

previous poster worded it wrong, there is not even no shock event, there is not even any event... if you think this pullback is because suddenly people realized bitcoin has growth pains and decided to instasell, then you are delusional, apart from that, one could also argue the runup was caused by BIP148 hopes, but it wasn't either. what happened is that lots of stupid money entered Bitcoin, many probably told their co-workers etc etc and probably felt smart about it, well, this causes short term spikes, because most of the new people probably throw money at bitcoin before even understanding how it works, and sell before realizing having ever used it or thought about why it works...bottom line: weak hands /speculators /newbs taking easy profits, feel good about it for a weekend and buy back after having realized why this thing has value in the first place :) you're welcome.

really liking this idea...
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:00:05
well yeah, but they have no idea what will result in the most value for their coins, no offense to them, but they are miners, and just like real miners, they have no long term vision, or do you think a gold mine worker cares for gold price manipulation/speculation? he cares about one thing, selling that shit as quick as he has it in his hands. if miners really cared about bitcoin, they would not sell them all, but hold considerable amounts of them for themselves. miners don't need extra support by users or devs or whoever. they are by design being supported by the matter they crush out of the stone, uhm, the bits...
also, since you rbtc guys alway mention satoshi and his vision, do you think he would be ok with miner centralization and pool mining? your points would have way more validity if miners consisted of a vastly decentralized network of private guys mining on their cpus at home, this is not the case unfortunately.
there is a rather smart solution to the scaling problem, and it is apparent the (forgive me the accusation) apparently 'stupid' (chinese) miners around jihan don't seem to understand. since the price keeps rising anyways, there are not many who seem to care much, but telling you, segwit is technologically and in terms of implications for the whole ecosystem a 1000x better solution than unlimited blocks. if unlimited blocks leads to massive centralization, bitcoin might even end up failing cause who really wants to be part of a centralized network like it would become then? not me!
so, after months of both reading rbtc and rbitcoin, I came to the conclusion rbtc is a bunch of etherum trolls that want the worst for bitcoin, powered by two apparently narrow-minded charismatic leaders that merely want the best for themselves.
all this increase blocksize and we moon talk is childish and dangerous. it will moon anyway, just try to grow up ffs and admit your defeat, SW is the way to go, all relevant market participants and userbases agree. maybe the users are not yet all the way there, cause segwit is a little hard to understand in detail for average joe (like me) and it is better not to rush things (never change a running system).
right now, as someone pointed out recently here in this sub, we will get sidechains for a solution of the scaling problem anyways, 100s of tx/s, and with SW would allow this solution to be completely trustless, and also allow for another one that can scale to 1000+tps (Lightning)
I as an user don't want to buy tps with the sideeffect of more miner centralization, and even worse: more node centralization. nodes are very important, if you don't know that you are in denial or must be hostile to bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:39:33
which decreases the practical absolute supply, increasing the value of all other coins by a bit. lost coins can be considered gifts to the whole community
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:22:52
you know, I don't give a fuck what they agree on, I am a user, and I figured out how and why SegWit is the best scaling-solution, what they agree on is irrelevant for me now.
when it comes to businesses. you are my bitches too. I have bitcoins and I can spend them whenever with whomever I want, don't even dare to think about having any real say beyond my kind.
you know why? because I will take my business elsewhere if you don't support BIP148.
To all bitcoiners out there, we are not sparta, spartans lost in the end. democracy is not something that gets agreed upon by some guys behind closed doors. democracy is something you earn by kicking the balls of any malicious actors.
and do I need to remind you how malicious jihan and roger ver are acting?
to all the newcomers: if you just recently found out about bitcoin because the price rose, you might not be yet familiar how things work here. Bitcoin has no boss! and this is why the price is so high. once it gets a boss, or someone that cheats the system to be able get an unfair advantage over all the others, we can not call it Bitcoin anymore, it's a shitcoin then!
bitcoin is growing, and miners are doing what they can to push the fees as high as possible to force users to embrace the wrong solution, one that would give miners even more power. this wrong solution is a block-size increase, which would ultimately lead to taking away your voting rights! why? because bigger blocks put a strain on any computer that participates in the bitcoin network! and these malicious actors don't want you to have a vote, so they can secure their (extra) profits!
this is all about Asicboost!
fight them. run a BIP148 node and keep running it until miners take their place again and confirm transactions instead of cheating the system.
miners are supposed to secure the network, not secure their own advantage over other miners by cheating with asicboost!

yes, unfortunately a little too powerful, this is what you get when you are not vigilant enough, back when SW was first brought up they started with conspiracy theories, paid shills etc etc, core devs are not mustered for such shit slinging, they are busy making good code and then these asshats come by and bring up all kinds of arguments against it, all arguments except technically valid ones! then they came with fake agreements and stalling etc. . fast forward to today: turned out bitmain could become so powerful, cause it uses a hidden electricity saving feature in their miners that allows them to mine 2000% more profitable than others (asicboost). if you let this go on for a while you get a monopoly. this is why we have to UASF and teach these guys a lesson in decentralization...but the more techncally levelheaded reason: it fixes many problems with bitcoin...it is merely an upgrade, but it is being opposed, and it is evident this must be because with SegWit no hidden asicboost is possible anymore. in the past they had no problem accepting any upgrade, but now bitmain goes berzerk and blocks this...why? cause it costs them their crazy advantage...if we don't act, we will have a president or king of bitcoin called jihan wu, and nobody wants a WU-coin :)

so we need a way to vote with held bitcoins. remember the guy with 70k bitcoins on bitcointalk? he should have a bigger say on where the ship is to go than some guy with 1bitcoin. do you think this could be done anonymously somehow? is there a way to maybe get inspired by - or copy - decred's on-chain voting mechanism? idk, if 75% of Bitcoin holders voted for the activation of segwit, I would call it a day, or is my logic flawed there?
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:13:26
I thought that too for a long time, turns out it is interdependent, the issue with this is that since gpus and asics, miner centralization has become unnaturally high, even satoshi did not envision this, of course not, he is no prophet or jesus or whatever - and now we have miner centralization, and guess what, miners act up, try to powergrab this multibillion economy! (imho atleast) and on the other side we have a healthy node network that keeps miners in check.
now guess what needs to be protected, and what needs to potentially be replaced?
but to your question: well, this is the most important part about bitcoin: running a node, basically brings you no money, but it secures the network in a way that makes sure that the bitcoin you hold, that one once bought from a miner who mined them, keep their value and increase vs an inflationary currency like the dollar...how you make sure of that? well, if there are enough nodes running, and enough spread out, and you use these nodes to transfer btc to an exchange or other people, you basically tell these exchanges or other people that this is the tool you trust to give your bitcoins value.
fast forward to today: in all this scaling stalemate there has a special node popped up, it is exactly the same as the core node that basically everyone runs which makes bitcoin a bitcoin :) - now this node tells the miners, "look guys, you either update to the newest wallet and go with the best way anyone can come up to improve bitcoin and have all the nice features that will make it moon, OR we (these nodes) will not process your old transactions anymore and you can have your own coin!"
so what this simple running of this special node does is give every regular joe and small bitcoin believer/holder a way to express and especially enforce his opinion or conviction what direction bitcoin should go. in this case it is only about scaling and simply activating SegWit. I absolutely want this, so I run such a node. cause I like many believe bitcoin will moon once it scales and has a skilled developer team behind it. also, it might help lessen the miner centralization factor in the long run.
and here we are, we have conflicts of interest. miners on one side, and the rest of the users on the other side, only problem: many users are not informed enough to figure this out, many also go to r/btc and listen to cheap truths. and I was one of them couple months ago, you know why? cause I thought I understand bitcoin and there can not possibly be anything wrong by simply increasing the blocksize.
oh was I wrong. :)

no, it's technical ignorance of a vast userbase. good example: me. I was asking for a 'simple blocksize increase and even bought into that blockstream bilderberg bs...just to find out later this guy will oppose everything to keep its 2000% profit edge over other miners, with these profits, and the gullible roger ver clown, they buy lots of influence over uneducated users. but the users are slowly seeing through their shit and finally doing the right thing: run BIP148 node

thanks for confirming, couple months ago I exclusively posted over there and nobody would ever talk about core without mentioning blockstream, it has become a circle jerk-mantra, I feel so dirty for ever having fallen for this cesspool and the "just simple fork to 2mb" and I did that because I thought I understand Bitcoin enough and such a simple change just can't be wrong. turned out from an engineering perspective it is stupid, risky, and a whole other array of undesirable things..

we, the users, can run whatever we want. currently we trust the core developer team which never let us down and does an astonishingly good job for many years for Bitcoin and they probably hold bitcoins as well, so they profit from it too, but there are many idealists in it who do it purely for idealism, I really respect them for this.
SegWit has been prevented and stalled for more than a year, we users can run code that automatically excludes non-segwit blocks now, since one of the devs (lukejr) has had enough and wrote a simple change to the otherwise identical core Bitcoin software - anyone can run it on their computers and cause the change that we all need to have a Bitcoin with lots of cool features, while staying decentralized!
Bitcoins has many pillars of decentralization, usually no single pillar can force change upon all other pillars.
if miner really really don't want this BIP148 change, then they can cause a chain split, which creates two versions of bitcoin, and all holders will have the same amount of coins on both chains - so no loss there - both claim to be Bitcoin, but people around here believe that only a more decentralized Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin.
but to tell you my opinion, I think none of the miners are against SegWit, they just pretend! and you know why? because pretending brings them lots and lots of money! the longer they can delay SegWit, the more miner fees they can make, this is because currently so many new Bitcoiners are coming and using the network, that there is an ongoing auction for inclusion on the Bitcoin blockchain! this bidding war, so to say, brings miners almost as much money as they get by mining Bitcoins! this is absolutely not how it was intended initially, also Bitcoin mining itself was never intended to be so centralized, but people put up with it, because the node network is strong and decentralized, now these guys pretend not to want SegWit, and otherguys pretend we need bigger blocks, while the smartest solution (confirmed by the best coders in all of cryptoland) is staying with the size how blocks are right now and activating SW, which brings a solution.
that's why I support this BIP148 Bitcoin application, and run it  full force ahead :)

yeah, it would break his vision of bitcoin, screw asicboost
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:05:39
cause you can exert political influence with that kind of power in Bitcoin..see it this way: if 60% of hashes are produced by bitmain hardware (mind you, does not need to be bitmain themsleves) because it is the most efficient hardware, then you could buy miner's votes and convictions in regards to protocol development by offering them access to asicboost. there is extra hardware on bitmain miners that can do covert 2000% profit boost, and who says bitmain does not use this as leverage basically buying political votes?
so, you see the problem there? Bitcoin is under attack by one very powerful miner, and the longer we wait the more powerful he gets, the math is simple: have someone in a self regulating system act with a 2000% profit edge over a too long timespan, and he will buy out all competitors and create a monopoly, and then Bitcoin is done. :)
USAF and make this entity (bitmain, jihan) play by the rules, mining with covert asicboost and enriching yourself against Bitcoin's deentralization model is something that is not sustainable for Bitcoin itself...and we have been watching this stalling for how long now? 1 year, 2 years? it is my fault, and every other user's not having stepped in against this long before.
edit: thinking a little further and having one on core slack mention "asicboost is by far not the only asic optimization out there" I wonder: is it the most profitable one? if yes, then given by the fact that asicboost is even patented (centralization) it makes it a really big threat to Bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:56:25
everyone thinking this was a bubble...lol.. they call mt.gox a bubble, cause the price of the coins back then did potentially not even reflect the supply, --that-- is a bubble, when you got nothing to back a claim (price) up. but ever since gox, there was no bubble anymore, maybe the bitfinex hack created a temporary one, but a bubble basically can only exist when someone does FIAT on top of bitcoin, and the most likely scenario for this is a theft of underlying coins. did not happen --&gt; no bubble. if there is no such underlying misrepresentation at hand, you can call a spike of last week merely a short time peak due to market forces, high demand, low supply. bubble = high demand, fake supply..

"run a fork of core (prepared by xyz?!)" and after that "activate Segwit ASAP" don't make me overly confident. - I mean asap is not immediatly, sounds a lot like more stalling tactic...
I know we can not 100% prove all this is about asicboost, maybe it is about inflating the fee market as a way to squeeze out more profit, or the other usual suspicions like ego trolling or fud-based altcoin insider trading...
who knows, we will see. whether any of this will not have been for asicboost, I will only start believing once there is an effective fix out - right now it is not even 100% clear if 100% fixable at all afaik...

no. there is a chance to almost increase your coins amount though, but risky. one could buy the BIP148 tokens even before they become the new upgraded Bitcoin, if BIP148 succeeds you will have more coins than before. if it doesn't you will loose the ones you risked betting on the future. if the average joe just does nothing and only hold, he will not lose or gain anything, except a higher $ price overall in the end cause I think Bitcoin with segwit is way more worth than one without it..support BIP148 let's go guys

@_date: 2017-05-16 15:04:12
cause this system is based on self-interest, if Bitcoin developed away from the interest of its holders, or stopped developing, also potentially against the interest of its holders, holders are more likely to become sellers. idk if the digital gold argument in a locked development environment is reason enough to hold, and I am agnostic about whether it is or not, but if it is, then I guess all is fine, but any other way, people taking so much risk holding so many bitcoins, should probably have a way to express their opinions in order not to be totally speculative in all of this..just some thoughts. I mean if I held 70k bitcoins, depending on how much I paid for it, if anything, I would probably develop an interest in pertaining and securing this value. Don't get me wrong, I myself have this opinion that Bitcoin already in the current state is worth thousands of dollars a pop, simply because it is what it is already. so maybe the market needs to decide on these issues. Just wondering what goes on in the mind of someone with 70k bitcoins I guess ;) And I would like to hear his point on the scaling debate..and btw, wouldn't it be just simply fair to give more coins more influence on Bitcoin than fewer coins? like 1 coin 1 vote? or am I now completely misunderstanding Bitcoin and it doesn't need any governance at all?

so two people meet in a room and agree that from now on 1kg is 1200grams. you as a scientist were not invited to join discussion though. so do you agree that from now on 1kg is 1200grams?
this agreement is vaporware, and absolutely meaningless. just some posturing with the aim to further complicate, stall, and screwup the situation..
keep calm and UASF on..August 1st Bitcoin will scale with the best, most tested and engineering-wise efficient and stable way. most likely even way before this date.
and after this I expect everyone in the community to be buddies again and forgive each other's emotional mishaps! things got heated up a bit, but we all share the same idea of Bitcoin's underlying value proposition, and there will always be egos who (temporarily) don't get it.
who knows, maybe one day some other actor from a different pillar of Bitcoin's decentralization model will attempt a power grab, and he or they shall be stopped as well...

clouding your mind? hehe - well uncloud it, get informed, find out why things are happening, who is obviously profiting and just see through it - bitcoin is great, on paper, but since satoshi it has developed to things he could not have envisioned. so ask yourself two things: does bitcoin still work as intended by the whitepaper, is it still decentralized and disruptive? if you say yes, than disregard all the fuzz and hodl - if you say no, then ask yourself what you can do to make it more decentralized again and quickly you will find out that the current scaling debate offers a solution and there are many actors trying to cloud that solution cause these actors most likely are hostile to the principles you so much like about bitcoin - at least this is what I figured out, but it took me months and a couple months of them I spent exclusively over at that other subreddit, and well, the recent eth bubble seems to be result of what that sub does :) - I know it sounds too all too simple this time, but if you want SegWit in a timely manner UASF is the best way. for a long time I had the opinion "why risk it, UASF is risky, Bitcoin still is a good store of value etc etc" but then I found out about asicboost and that changed my mind. it needs to be stopped and the playingfield of mining leveled...if all of this sounds clouding to you, get informed, bitcoin can not survive if it consists of users with clouded vision on it - I thought we all agreed centralization of any kind is bad for bitcoin.. :)

eth does not even compare to bitcoin, it is way less decentralized, and it has a leader lol - and if something goes wrong you can call someone, and ask for a fork!
ethereum is as comparable to bitcoin as fax machines are to the internet.
yes it is a nice project, but they could have built it as a regular stock traded company...
everyone holding ethereum btw, prepare for a landslide sell off after roger pulls out his eth - in case you did not notice, many think eth was used to be pumped while r/btc spread lies about SegWit! after the pump comes the selloff, I expect a drop in 50-75% maybe even before august 1st
if you want a catchy comparison: ethereum is closer to ripple than to bitcoin ideologically.
it is not their fault though. making a completely self reliant supercomputer unfortunately is too good to be true. turned out it was not true :)

it usually comes down when everyone agrees we are in a bubble, usually induced by some kind of bad news. currently, we are not in a bubble, but if we see very steep panic buy like rises to 6-10k$ a piece, we might be in a bubble.
but, and big but: if the scaling stalemate gets solved, and prospects of a cheap and safe while still decentralized bitcoins come up by SegWit getting accepted, 6-10k might not even be a bubble but justified.

as I said many times: there will be another hype bubble, we have not yet started into it. but the more important question is: will the users understand what they are investing in, and will they understand Bitcoin's value proposition, which is designed to be anti fragile, and will they help to kick every BUTT that is threatening to centralize this golden child, and oppose every actor that tries to tilt its balance of power-model? I surely hope, but I highly doubt hordes of gold-rush newcomers will adapt quickly enough to this paradigm shifting new form of money. so, I expect some crazy $8-13k spikes, but everything above 6.6k is too high pre-SegWit. if no major bad news come up, and bip148 gains traction, prices floating around 4,5k to 7k seem reasonable this time, spikes to over 10k are to be expected if hordes of newbs come in, but these 5 digit spike prices are not sustainable currently..

@_date: 2017-05-16 20:31:21
there is no reason to sell, Bitcoin, as it is right now, is already fulfilling the value proposition that is inherent to how it works. I could not care less not to economically(!) be able to buy my daily coffee with it because of high fees. if you want your coffee to be eternalized on a global decentralized state-influence-immune ledger, well then pay the fee. but to use bitcoin to buy small things is clearly payment-method-overkill, if you consider that the BU clowns proposed solution is to raise the block size while essentially rendering Bitcoin a visa-like centralized payment provider prone to state level attack vectors. (node centralization will do that.)
so, doing nothing is ok with me, SW is desired by me. it annoys me that it is not activated already, but apart from that I am confident cause there is no rush really, and I am hopeful in a way that I think that jihan guy's just playing mindgames and wants to feel important or something, small ego syndrome maybe, who knows. apart from that, he is rather irrelevant to the future of bitcoin, worst case bitcoin could run without his asics. from what I have gathered so far the mining process is merely a system to make it artificially hard (energy consuming) to get your hands on them, thus giving them initial ideal value. we could just use another algorithm to mine these coins, preferably one that everyone can use on their cpus if we make sure everyone gets informed about this, so nobody feels left out, then even I could mine a few coins again :)
if push comes to shove, jihan would lay down his weak hand, and stop pretending that it is a strong hand.
so I am not worried, instead I'm hopeful, confident and annoyed, pretty scizo tbh :)

but you agree that BIP148 is the safe, and brave way to activate SegWit? you also do know what kind of headlines it produces for bitcoin if we follow through with this?






this is priceless and worth the risk 100times over.
your arguments are all valid, at present time at least, and yes, you do not see major merchants running BIP148, and I am just saying, if we, the users push for BIP148, run it on our machines, create some fuzz about this, then merchants will follow.
miners will not want to give up power in all of this easily, but they need to be taught a lesson to sit down, shut up, and process my transaction. they make and made lots of money, and the longer we wait for them them to become even richer and more powerful, the more we will regret it later.
I am just speaking for myself, I have had enough for this. there are no good valid reasons that we are not having the benefits of SegWit in Bitcoin, and this BIP148 helps to enforce what we, the users, want.
so let's just see how much noise we can make, so big merchants not just hear us, but understand that, to keep the bitcoin space attractive, a precedent in decentralization must be set, by applying a gentle slap on the check, as a reminder, for miners.  :)
so do we both agree that we want to see how many will jump on board with BIP148?

jep and you just fell for cheap propaganda. with segwit, bitcoin does not become like a bank, instead you can still be your own bank, running a node validating the whole network and making sure it stay decentralized. with no word that guy mentioned what kind of centralization happens with ever increasing blocksizes. he says small users will be priced out of the network and admits to mention the decentral nature of the network will be destroyed if blocks become too big for small node operators. bitcoin is not really trustless money, unless you run your own node. if you don't run your own node, you rely on a 3rd party for validation. blockstream pays it's employees in bitcoin in advance, meaning, they convert dollars to usd, and if everyone does good work, the price of btc rises, and the devs earn more money, talk about the right kind of incentive there.
he mentions satoshis's vision, but fails to mention satoshis vision is outdated. the reality has changed with miner centralization, and if we allow miners too much power they will exploit the network and ultimately destroy it. do you trust a bunch of chines miners to control a global decentralized network? BU trolls believe this! let me give you a hint: BU is a bunch of rather shortsighted trolls who openly push ethereum, they create dramas and apart from short term gains they seem not to have the best in mind for bitcoin's success, rather their own short term gains, and yes, raising the blocksize might cause bitcoin to skyrocket short term, and it would fail long term, I would not use it anymore if I can't run a full node cause of internet caps, bandwidth or disk space limitations, simple as that.
long term blocksize needs to increase, like linearly, while tps increase more or less exponentially on sidechains or 2nd layers. from what I could gather right now, the safest way to go about this is to activate Segwit now, and increase blocksize accordingly later. BU guys see a conspiracy in this, and there we are...

imho alts are here to steal the candy if or once Bitcoin screws up. a smart investor could hedge his Bitcoin with one or a few select alts. also alts are inspiring Bitcoin with new technologies. there is/was a reason for privacy coins to gain in value, as Bitcoin is not as private as it could be. I don't follow the space too closely, but there are definitely interesting developments to be seen there. of course I don't want to promote buying alts, cause in general they are just super risky, and I agree with Andreas that many use alts merely to get hold of more Bitcoins in the end, that being said, given the recent governance issues and deadlock in the scaling debate of Bitcoin, there is a good chance governance coins might see a similar boost as privacy coins have seen. with governance coins I mean coins that solve the "who is in charge" problem elegantly. afaik ethereum failed horribly at this, since they boasted to have this autonomous computer that relied only on code, until a bug was found ;) so, everyone stay tuned. sleeping at night is easier if you hedge your favorite coin with a coin that does almost the same as your favorite coin but excels at a little detail where your favorite one might eventually stumble

now, to all the new users, take this friendly advice from a slightly older user:
* consider carefully going through that list, noting all the companies there, and check if you do business with them.
* consider quit doing business with them
a good friend of mine once told me: in this world, you vote with your wallet.
here is the list:
edit: deleted the companies in the middle, sorry  my mistake!
but as always: research before you take action! Bitcoin is in a very exciting phase - moon is closing in - and under attack by people who want to squeeze lots of money out of it by sacrificing yet another one of its important pillars of decentralization! - I think we can not afford this, and I think we can not afford them. anyways

"usage increase / popularity" is a problem when we can not accommodate all new users without forcing them to bid for the cheapest service fee that still gets them a transaction.
and currently there are two ideas how to solve this, there is
the simple one:
* increase the blocksize, immediately creating more space on the blockchain, allowing users to have cheap and fast transactions, only apparent downside: less regular users run bitcoin nodes, result: bitcoin will centralize more and make it prone to state level attacks.
the complex one:
* create a protocol extension that allows for a bunch of scaling solutions on a 2nd level, or a side-level, only downside: nothing substantial that I know of.


increasing the blocksize would probably increase the number of users in short term &amp; worst case / long term: sell out user's privileges on the Bitcoin network through centralization, and thus maybe even decrease it's userbase, unless of course it becomes the NWO's wet dream and mandatory for the world government - then it would be too late to use an alternative, cause there might not be wouldn't be one, so more users in in that fictional case Oo
so, yes and no, it will increase user-base, but due to further centralization of just another one of Bitcoin's pillars of decentralisation ('bitcoin nodes' AND 'bitcoin mining') it might not be considered Bitcoin anymore, and should start to be opposed by everyone who had satoshi's vision in mind when he came to Bitcoin and started to realize how revolutionary this beautiful thing really is.
so more users? yes. recommendable to new users? hell no, only if you tell them the truth that Bitcoin, by then, would not really be decentralized and trust-less anymore, and would continue to become less and less so.
you know, Bitcoin has not that many pillars in it's decentralizaion model, depening on how you count, 4,5, maybe 6
everyone agrees that 1 of them is already utterly compromised. Bitcoin mining. everyone in the BU camp argues with satoshi's vision and emergent consensus and stuff, but fails to notice horribly that satoshi NEVER envisioned neither
* pooled mining
* GPU/ASIC mining centralizaion
* nationally centralized mining (china)
* freaking Asicboost (an almost 2000% profit boost by a single mining actor, completely leading ad absurdum the whole mining pillar)
and since this is the case, and we (users) have not (yet) replaced these (malicious to the Bitcoin idea) miners. it would be absolutely disastrous to even start compromising on the 'Bitcoin nodes' pillar!
so this makes your conviction look like you are ok with sell out for a short gain, maybe you are a bitcoin speculator, and want a short spike to $6000 and then get out, at the cost of Bitcoin's principles, a cost, that in the current state, Bitcoin can neither afford ideologically, nor image-wise.
that is not to say Bitcoin would not succeed anyways, but then you'd have to define 'success of Bitcoin': is success for you either
* global usage of Bitcoin NOW, run by a few actors who the users have no other choice but to trust
or B
* global usage of Bitcoin, run by a vastly decentralised array of users and a couple of "pillars of decentralization", which the users can fire anytime any of the pillars start acting up?
go figure!


I don't think we should fire the miners right now either. But, we should not treat the PoW option as a "last resort" "worst case scenario" or "nuclear option" but instead as something actually desirable from an user's perspective. miners serve a pretty dull purpose in the Bitcoin network, they are designed to earn a profit from creating bitcoins by solving math problems. they are profit oriented and everyone can be a miner and earn Bitcoins by mining, except, this is by far not the case anymore! and it is a huge problem! one that we all ignored, because we had so many other pillars of decentralization left, we basically, until now, just put up with them, nobody in Bitcoin space considers the state of mining to be 'ok', except miners, or people hostile to Bitcoin.


no, this is an engineering problem, and it is possible to choose a PoW that would easily take a whole asic industry 1-2 years to come up with new specialized processors again, and after 2 years, you could just change that again, and so forth. mining centralization is nothing that can not be prevented, we just put up with it because we had enough other pillars of decentralizaion, and now these BU guys come up with a solution that would compromise yet another pillar, but not with me my friend.  BIP148 baby, and if miners don't behave, we will take away their Asics too :D easy as that. imagine the headlines, imagine the publicity boost, even speculators would cheer, as Bitcoin would be more Bitcoin than it has been ever before, and that means moon, nothing else :)

do you mean bitcoin users or bitcoin speculators? cause if you really know what bitcoin is about, and see what eth is about, then you notice they are not even comparable. it's like deciding to buy tesla stock if bitcoin does not scale...no offense, but there is no flippening, either bitcoin succeeds and altcoiners realize their alt speculation profits by coming back, or bitcoin fails and the idea of decentralisation in crypto is getting buried, or a project like decred shoots up, who knows..but not eth, it's a completely different pair of shoes...if you call yourself a bitcoin user, you must have an interest in bitcoin succeeding, so I assume you run a BIP148 node at least?

it is a DOA - and also not worth mentioning or discussing, a stalling tactic, hidden in a seemingly serious proposal.
they know they got their pants down, and users can even fire them.
been thinking about gearing this whole thing up to with promoting a PoW change as another realistic tool for user-change, just to further humble miners not to try to game the system anymore. after all, as an user, I have no big interest to have these people earn more than the best rappers in the world a year, by running some highly specialized processor in huge mining farms.
to all newcomers: in Bitcoin, we the users could even fire the miners, and get new ones! yes, we the users, could even make you users also be miners! THIS is actually what satoshi envisioned in the first place, and in the beginning of Bitcoin everyone could mine bitcoins on their CPU.
with a PoW change, you guys could mine Bitcoins with your graphics cards again! and it would take many years for a new breed of ASICminers to come up, if ever, cause we could just fire them as well!

yeah so what? is this the Bitcoin space a moral place? it was designed with human greed in mind, and we have an issue with overstepping greedy miners, and these companies allied up with these miners in this agreement. we can not lose another pillar of Bitcoin's decentralization model and thus I suggest not supporting companies who side with them, easy as that.
I am really sorry if they require on-chain micro-transactions for their business model, but Bitcoin was not designed or at least not ideal for enabling large scale on-chain low volume micro-transactions from the get go.

fair plan, but don't forget to reassess your strategy every day, things are changing so rapidly right now and the problem bitcoin has right now is a few clowns with a rather big influence and big centralized hashrate trying to either take over bitcoin, or make money by manipulating the price by justified fud. so if you are certain long term it is a hodl, good for you, I usually am too, just not for the next say 7-14 days. I want to see BCH die quick and we'll go to the moon, not even november fork will be a thing anymore then, you can only pull this one trick once, before it loses its appeal.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:11:44
depends on how much you need these $70, generally you lose money by not hodling longer than other hodlers, bitcoin was the worlds best performing currency in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 &amp; 2016, and the worlds worst performing currency in 2014. if this trend continues, your $70 in bitcoin cound be worth 140, 300, 500, 1000 or more in the coming years, of course you could also lose it all, people around here say "never invest more than you are willing to lose" are you willing to lose $70 if bitcoin fails and be ok with it? that's the question you need to ask yourself :)

@_date: 2017-05-22 05:38:29
if you buy only for the price, without understanding what makes bitcoin valuable, you might have some disheartening episodes when it drops back to $600 because we could not break free from malicious chinese miner influence...to give you an update: bitcoin could benefit from a few very important fixes, while also allowing for large scale scaling and low fees! but miners are blocking it because it would most probably take away some of their currently inflated extra profits in miner fees.
so right now there is some kind of call to arms going on, called user activated soft fork (UASF) which gives users the chance to use their brain and vote for the right solution in the scaling debate.
and trust me, I did make every mistake in crypto, including buying some altcoins cause they sounded like they were better than bitcoin, back then, I didn't really understand what makes bitcoin valuable...oh and I even fell for the cheap blocksize increase propaganga on r/btc for a while, until I figured out they have no real arguments except cheap conspiracy theories Oo but I guess I have learned my lesson ;)
and now I have enough of it and encourage everyone to run a bitcoin node on their computer...ideally a BIP148 node. this will force the issue and end the debate in august 2017...

is it true that it there is no essential difference between owning a million dollar and a billion dollar, given that on a million dollar you could also very well retire and have all you'd ever need - does the metric "all you ever need" change a lot in regards to "all you can afford" in your opinion?
Just trying to get a sense of your view on money in general, how you treat and deal with it.
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:43:00
there are some people in bitcoin who want that it will become very centralized in the future, they don't have very much foresight, they mostly want this because it would mean a higher price very quick, then there are others who have a smart and tested solution for the current problems with too many new people coming and transactions being delayed. but this group can not simply say we go this way, because Bitcoin is not designed this way, there is no single group or guy saying where Bitcoin goes :) so, this time, the people, the users are starting a movement to go for the best change in their opinion, and it looks like they are choosing the solution of the second group!
and by voicing their opinion, they start up or switch their nodes (computers running bitcoin) to signaling for UASF (user activated soft fork)
this soft fork will activate on august 1st, and if the second group does not also upgrade, they will lose a lot of money, so they will upgrade and do what the users of bitcoin want!
now, bitcoin has many users, just regular guys like you and me, but also businesses like exchanges and merchants like newegg and japan :) - but also developers are users in a way! so, basically what is happening is a referendum, having a vote on what people want. if people want something, they have to voice their opinion, go to exchanges, ask them to activate this change and of course run a node that signals for this change!
this is what signalling for UASF segwit means in ELI5, I hope you understand better now :)

nowhere he says he will sell his bitcoins for bcc, cause he won't and even if he said that he would, he would not, cause he is a known liar. he just uses his stash of bitcoins to troll the space a little and make profits with his market weight, at least this' the way I see it. put him on an imaginary ignore list of yours, and be fine. you could try to time the market anticipating new dick moves of this guy, or bitmain, or any other entity trying to insider-trade, - but unless you are the one manipulating the market and driving the narrative, or own "bitcoin.com" domain, you are likely to lose a few coins rather than gain a few. so, hodl :)

not without a little help from news
if you see more and more "bitcoin exchange xyz supporting BIP148 UASF"-news in the next few weeks popping up, then speculators will bet on bitcoin to finally scale and do away with malicous asicboost abusing miners!
and well, scaling is the biggest reason why the guys at r/investing laughed me out the door ;) if bitcoin scales while retaining its core values, don't expect to be able to buy below 5 digits anymore.
I'll stick to my prediction I made in the past:
Bitcoin's max stable value without SegWit, leading up to a positive August 1st outcome:
* $4k-$6.6k a pop
Bitcoin when it's clear it will scale and decentralize more and technically progress/upgrade showing the ones who pumped ETH by spreading fud about BTC over at r/btc clownshow, making the clown-car ultimately burst in flames: 
* goodbye $10k forever.
oh and as as side note, if it becomes evident BIP148 locks in cause user force will have businesses ultimately convinced to go for it, ETH will definitely "dip" (hard). all this assuming no major bad news comes up in the next about 3 months, and that Bitcoin just keeps working on without any kind of surprising new bug being found, but there's always that.. if a big exchange goes burst, similar to the goxxening, it will dip Bitcoin for sure, but not as much as back in the day - Bitcoin has matured, and people have warned other newcomers a lot not to ever leave Bitcoin on exchanges, and I'll repeat why: if the Bitcoin is on an exchange, it is not your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:54:32
basically what it boils down to - but make no mistake, roger and jihan are just insider trading, creating fud, promoting ethereum and maybe other alts, they probably bought these alts, they rose, and they will fall right after they announcement to give in and support/mine SegWit - guess who will sell all their eth profits right before this announcement?
they are childish and immature, but they are not stupid, they just abuse their current influence for a short term gain imho

if you're from the UK (edit: or Germany, editII: or EU) and understand what BIP148 enforces, what values it stands for and what values exchanges which run it stand for: consider opening an account with them and giving them business, they apparently know what gives Bitcoin value.
disclaimer: always check if an exchange, apart from the obviously good decision to run bip148, is sound and has a good reputation! never leave Bitcoins at an exchange, Bitcoins are only yours if you control the private key. no Bitcoin stored at any exchange is controlled by you! :)

roger ver has been doing this for a long time by registering bitcoin.com and creating lots of altcoin spam, fud, anti bitcoin propaganda on r/btc, and a lot more of dirty fuckery. it did not work, and it will not work, many think he lost a lot of his initial early adopter bitcoin stash doing so, I guess that's his price of tuition, and he really needs it, he talks and argues like a 6yr old and behaves very immaturely every time I see anything of him. so, yes, it is possible, but bitcoin devours almost any kind of personas which become too influential, which is good, as it proves the decentralization model is working even outside the blockchain.I guess the community just rewards humility and good code instead of propaganda, strong-arming and/or dictators. this is how I like it to be, world is full enough of false prophets and even if a real prophet came up one day, like with really good views and ideals, our toxic society would corrupt him/her in a very short timeframe. good thing that bitcoin allows for a different approach to this, I really hope bitcoin causes some mind-shift at some point down the road, having a new society emerge which does not buy into bullshit anymore, one that would be way tougher to bullshit as well, would be desirable.

well I thought it would have to dip before that date, but it seems to pump a little, no idea about afterwards, I see it tanking if BCH does not die immediately, and surge if it does. if there will be two bitcoins, I expect mayor troubles ahead, up to preemptively having to call the bitcoin experiment failed. it is hard enough to explain bitcoin to people, try explaining them two, one china-coin, and one coin with a changed PoW. no idea. watching this from the sidelines now.

don't talk about worst case scenario, or you will be guided by fear. it is simple, if businesses don't come on board in hoards in the next 8 weeks, it probably means they like how Bitcoin is right now and we could change nothing...
I don't want a chain split, but I don't fear one either. I just hope everyone including the big blockers, come to senses and go 
If need be, and especially since we already have miner centralization  making fun of Bitcoin decentralization ideals, I will fight tooth and nail for node decentralization.
Ideally we could even find a way how to increase blocksize linearly with average global bandwidth growth. it is just hard to find a metric for this.
And in a perfect world, both communities come together and fire the miners (pow change) while solving the scaling solution.
Am I the only one who thinks miner centralization is unacceptable for us users?
Why not go back to GPU mining?

long term: hodl short term: sodl if you manage to combine both you can make a profit, or lose out when it surges. your arguments are quite valid though, I just changed my mind today about the severity of the situation as well. also to note: it is not really about the price of bitcoin, but what bitcoin we are dealing with. you should not give the price too much attention, but more the ideals bitcoin stands for. if somehow chinese miners succeed to stuff a rather centralized clown-altcoin down the throats of the bitcoin community, and big finance aka goldman sachs decides to prop up THAT price, would you like to join that fraudulent train to the moon of universal enslavement? many would, cause many just care about the price, but I would most likely not, I am not that cynical, yet.

but you know that LN with SW is absolutely as decentral as bitcoin itself? even Roostock will be 100% trustless with SW from what I gathered. without SW rootstock will be almost trustless, which is not trustless.
increasing blocks is like using a hammer to make a computer run faster, it's just the wrong tool
so, you are not wrong, you have the right thoughts. and it needs to be pointed out that without SW all scaling solutions would at best be semi decentralized. SW need to activate asap.
(for other readers with in detail technical knowledge about RTSK and SW/LN, correct me if I am wrong.)

if you spend that kind of money to gain power over bitcoin, or any parts of it, you risk a PoW change in the end. if you want to destroy bitcoin, you better attack all pillars at the same time. I don't want to outline what that means, as it is scary a.f. but, no attacker would attack bitcoin openly. they way of war is by covert means, the most intelligent groups of people who control most of resources and influence know that ruling in the 20th and 21th century means doing it by covert means. it was smart of the "elites" to buy up all mainstream media outlets in a not so obvious way and hide their owners. now all people are under constant mind control, and good journalism has been raped hard ever since the 70'ies. (watch network 1976 for good entertainment) the internet is decentral and a revolution, but keep in mind, chip manufacturers implement remote capabilities into their chips, and nobody is outraged about this. we can have linux all we want if that intel processor after 2007 can call home whenever he gets some remote message Oo.
if bitcoin ever gets attacked, we, the plebs, won't even notice it. saying the elites are smart (I mean the real elites, not the puppets) makes me assume they will do it with style, like, not attacking to destroy, but attacking to overtake without anyone noticing! bitcoin is the wet dream of any covert ruler or ruling elite, when under hidden control!
I am not sure how far all this goes as of today. but to scare the little jezuz out of you I give you some thought: what makes you so sure that bitmain is not an agent of chinese state, AND blockstream is an agent of western leadership, agreeing to slowly take control of it while sacking all the gullible idealist idiots investing in it? ;)
the whole corporate world, and the whole university landscape, basically the whole world is sacked by corruption. if bitcoin succeeds in defeating these structures, it will most likely redefine families and a ton of value systems. corruption itself as an idea is most likely based on the idea and the drive of allowing oneself and his family (biological inheritance) an advantage! if bitcoin somehow succeeded to permanently level this playing field, societies would change.
I really hope they do, cause almost everything I see in this world seems super outdated to me...but the chances are so slim and it is even against human (biological) nature

no, segwit allows anyone to use the 2nd channel, even miners! miners are just, uhm, idk, maybe not very well informed about this thing, and maybe they just don't want to change anything cause business is good. also some miners, the biggest one profits from a exploit (asicboost) making them tons of money, so they create all kinds of arguments to delay segwit, at the cost of the people who use bitcoin. they need to be taught a lesson, and people need to be informed about all of this. go  BIP148 &lt;-- this is the solution!

we really need to leave the exchange realm and create a real circulation economy, it's gonna be tough, but we should start convincing farmers to sell part of their produce for bitcoin/crypto. they can buy laptops with it on newegg and others. once very primary resources like corn, flower and crude oil are purchasable with bitcoin, we have a real economy, this does not have to be so far away. sure, we still have this issue that every country that ever tried to sell their oil for anything else than USD, got invaded or has been threatened (russia)(iran), but, let them try to invade bitcoinistan ;). seriously though, buying fundamental resources directly with bitcoin is the endgame in all of this, or how many call it: moon. let's focus on this decentralized, exchanges and maybe privacy features like schnorr signatures and MAST as the next steps, correct me if only one of these is for privacy.

if it spikes uncertainty, all it will do is make the price dip temporarily, at least according to my most recent thoughts given to the subject. but I agree that this might be their intention! - but again, it might just simply backfire, because in order for Bitcoin clown-coin to be valuable, there need to be many trying to profit from it's value, some, including me, planned on not even selling it instantly waiting for a little prise rise, but giving it more thought, a relatively high priced BCC might cause some disruption, and we all know what fuckery the clowncar company is capable of pull off. so, yes and no, they might take some temporary profits, but at what cost? if the price in general falls they just lose out in mining profits, be it BTC or BCC and everyone knows markets react to uncertainty. I expect BTC to gradually rise because of Segwit and the innovation it allows for, but the next weeks, especially the next days, are furthest from smooth saling.

he's probably talking about when btc found a level it likes, be it 3k, 4 or 5k, many will start diversifying into alts again, but right now, no. with all the cool stuff SW allows for, it might also be that alts will become a little more irrelevant. in a way they add to the decentralization by innovation of bitcoin, so I guess the whole space will grow if bitcoin grows, as we have seen in the past.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:11:13
don't worry, they had to sign it for political and strategical reasons. who knows, maybe they were even offered access to asicboost - it does not matter. this agreement is meaningless, and among its purposes was:
* pretend to have a strong hand in all of this
* stall activation of SW further
* earn more from inflated fee market
* most likely keep using covert asicboost
the offered solution is bs, and basically an fu/insult to core, I overhead them saying it would mean a HF before SW with those 4th bit thingy (I don't completely understand that either)
these guys are basically the bullies that are making fun of the nerds, it's so backwards, like school days.
but hey, there is not need get get heated up about this, it can all be safely ignored, or dod you see any major exchange signing that agreement? well guess why not.
shall I tell you? cause users are in charge. the moment users figure out that what is being played here, and who profits from continuos stalling and kicking the can down the road, that moment users will withdraw business from the singer's companies, and then you will see companies withdraw from that list (if they even update it..)
and poloniex, bitstamp etc, they are waiting for users to make a move. UASF BIP148 nodes growing certainly helps a lot. a general sentiment for support for BIP148 does help a ton too. miners switching to BIP148 afaik helps even more! so everyone in this space can now act in their self interest. if decentralization and a levelheaded and quality code delivering developer team is paramount to you as a Bitcoin holder, friggin support BIP148 and get over this - run a BIP148 node :) and if you see your use and value case for Bitcoin diminished by business who signed that vaporware closed door agreement (hell they did not invite a single core member...) then consider not doing business with them (anymore).
that's all easy as that. Bitcoin is made to work exactly like that, every malicious actor gets what he deserves in the long run, but this only works if we understand Bitcoin, if we all disagree on what gives Bitcoin value, and what that value is, then Bitcoin will fail, just like democracies kinda failed. but that's a whole other subject.
well, no, since I scratched that matter let's go for it: do you know what makes democracies fail? two things come to mind:
* good people who fail to act
* stupid people.
have you ever wondered why the average American is considered slightly dull an naive globally? well, you host the biggest moloch of world finance and the biggest army to protect it's business, if the average american were as educated as the average japanese, you would have overthrown your government 10 times already ;) just saying! rulers love ignorant people! so easy to rule, so gullible :)
/offtipic end. let's not have ignorance about Bitcoin threaten Bitcoin, educate yourselves, all info is out there! and find out why Bitcoin is valuable, and you might find out, just like me, that without the paramount amount of decentralization properties, it is worth not much at all - and in the case it still succeeds, while being worth nothing but pretending to be worth something, it could even become a super dangerous troyan horse by which the old royal dynasties and global finance can have what they always wanted, world dominance :) but I did not think about that scenario too much cause it seems too implausible. anyways, I will just run my BIP148 node till august, and completely disregard and ignore the kicking and screaming, the dragging and scheming from that by now well known "other side" (i hate to use this 'side' word, cause in reality we are all in the same boat and prosper, at least anyone who has been here for a while and hodled :) this last realization, that we are all in the same boat, makes me 100% sure that "the other side" will, somewhen in July, close to the august date: stop kicking and screaming and give in, especially when big exchanges, under pressure from massive user request, will root for the BIP148 solution. and for the future we will have learnt that in Bitcoin, decisions are to be made so that Bitcoin "succeeds" without selling out its core values. so for one last time, educate yourselves, don't come here hoping for the price do double and triple, yes it will eventually, but we also must understand why it does it. cause if it doubles or triples cause secretly goldman sachs got hold of a few of Bitcoin's pillars of decentralization, maybe having it bought off of jihan (lol) :D - well then we would be in a world of shit, especially if they controlled the narrative that Bitcoin would be good and decentralized haha - just saying.. let's try not to let this happen!
edit, oh what the hell, completely missed the core of your question, such irony :D - here it is: Bitfury and F2pool are not really supporting this agreement, it is just posturing, they, and others will flip once BIP148 gets enough traction first from users, then from businesses. once lots of high volume exchanges and merchants come on sign up for BIP148, miners get scared, because then it means the BTC they mine on their chain would be worth very little or nothing,  they don't want this and become switchbitch :D (meaning: they switch to run BIP148, which will by then with 100% certainty already be implemented in an official core release. that's all to it, ignore all of them for the next 3 months and voice your support by running BIP148 node on your machine and create some fuzz an awareness :)
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:31:39

sw2x is code that is comparable to the BU clowncar. if 80% of miners run it, meaning the whole bitcoin network (actually only the mining part of it) runs untested or not so well tested exploding clowncarcode, well guess what, a bug and bitcoin goes to $0.1... or to 0...not trying to fud, but the market is currently just reacting to miners threatening to doing something super stupid which could lead to some catastrophic or semi catastrophic event. nobody wants catastrophic or semi catastrophic events in bitcoin - remember mt.gox? that was not even semi catastrophic in comparison..

because there is nothing substantial to agree to. it is diplomatic vaporware intended to further stall and prevent a fix to asicboost, something upon which one entity can buy lots of influence, and the longer we do nothing, the more powerful this entity gets. it is not about risking Bitcoin as a store of value, it is about risking Bitcoin entirely. the whole decentralization model is at stake here, without it, Bitcoin is a shitcoin. - there really is no alternative to UASF at this point - the potential reward is 100-1000x higher than the risk, and worst case Bitcoin stays the same as it is right now. idk why you think it could lose the "store of value" use-case? bitcoin only holds ideal value, it is being sold to people as this trustless decentralized money, and if there is one actor exploiting an exploit and becoming too powerful to be opposed by the rest of the network, then there is no "store of value" use case anymore either. - go run a BIP148 node and make sure your exchange understands the technical side of this matter, all useless politics aside..

I'm still sticking to my predictions throughout may and june that "bitcoin is worth north of 10k with segwit activated". to be fair, I also estimated a max price of 6k before segwit, but I was not expecting segwit to get activated so early, who would have. my reasoning is and was pretty simple: while segwit is not the 'be all end all' scaling solution, it clears the path for a multitude of 'be all end all' scaling solutions, and lots of other cool features. note sure if anyone gives a f. but I'll just continue: so, given that the price still rose, even though bitcoin development clearly got stalled effectively, and seemingly indefinitely, I expect and expected a massive outburst in price once SW gets through, thus the seemingly high 10k+ prediction.. one thing I can predict as well: if we reach 10k in a too quick spike, expect a massive temporary selloff right after - take all of this with a grain of salt, nobody knows where the price will go and I am talking out of my ass, I just got a little experience since I've been here for a while and endured the gox draught, that's all :)

really hard to explain, but we will get segwit, which is good news. and both sides kind of made it happen, so hopefully there won't be sides anymore in the future :) also, the 2x part of how we get segwit, will most likely be dropped or not accepted as it makes no technical sense and/or is dangerous, and it is 3 months away anyways

yes, it is right to contact them for a stance about Bitcoin - and also wrong because currently tons of new users stream in ant it just overloads their capacities
that being said, I really would like to know their stance on this :) - we need to know if they support a Bitcoin that is less centralized over a Bitcoin that is more centralized.
for me, a Bitcoin compromising one pillar of decentralization the other is doomed to become a covert corporate/ or bank-coin, unless it fails completely.
so lets fight for this. the U in UASF stands for users. this is applied direct democracy if you will.
also, you probably know this, but just in case: exchanges like bitstamp go with the herd as that is where they earn their money. we, the users are the herd, and luckily, we can decide on this, this is a first in the financial world, we should treat this privilege accordingly.
by running a BIP148 node on our PCs we vote for the best possible progress in the bitcoin world by trusting a group of developers that have never let us down and safeguarded the network whenever it only had the slightest hiccup or bug. but that's not all, this group only makes open source software, so everyone can review it! - also, everyone can join this group! there is absolutely no friggin reason for the conspiracy theories at this other sub where everyone tells you to buy ethereum...to all newcomers: don't fall for the crooks :) in altcoin space, prices rise, and prices fall ;)

absolutely agree, except that Bitcoin's follow up "bubble" could get sustained by SW activation and businesses joining BIP148 - in that case, the price increase that otherwise would cause a bubble and possibly a consolidation, would be justified and not retract at all ��

@_date: 2017-05-23 23:27:36
the proposal is completely irrelevant and a distraction tactic.
consider running a fullnode with BIP148 binaries, and telling your exchange that you want them to support an as decentralized Bitcoin as possible, cause this is the main basic value proposition of Bitcoin: decentralization.

It is really not easy to measure, and this probably also fuels the fire between the camps BU and Bitcoin - there is just a general conception here, that nodes are so important in what they do, that any doubling of the blocksize, would centralize them and would discourage the average joe from running one at their homes!
and I absolutely follow this thought, because if Bitcoin is not average joe's Money, then it could as well be Federal Reserve's money, and average joe is using Fed money for all his life already
but yeah, I think 2MB blocks would definitely be safe, but I am still not in favor of 2MB blocks, simply because there is no technical need for it right now.
the core devs gave a very clear and technically profound outline on how they see best fit for proceeding in bitcoin scaling, and it requires to
1. activate SW
2. see how well it performs and interacts in Bitcoin network.
3. reevaluate
4. increase blocksize if needed!
and now we have a stalemate, cause miners act up and got butthurt cause like everyone in this space is a noob when it comes to diplomacy it seems...or maybe it is just a human problem end everyone has an ego...
I am still hopeful that all people will let go off their egos, and go with the technically most sound scaling solution and exact procedure. and if they have no good arguments on this matter, or are not technically skilled enough to argue in terms of code, they should stfu (imho)
TIL: not sure if I answered your question. to sum it up: hard to measure, ideally blocksize is to be unchanged unless it needs to be increased, to know when it needs to be increased, SegWit needs to be implemented. SegWit needs to be implemented because it is the most elegant end efficient scaling solution with the least drawbacks.

well I do, did make a little at the last dip, I am ok with those gains, will not try my luck a second time, if I have learnt anything from trading bitcoin, it's that it's way easier to lose money betting on a falling price than just set and forget and go long aka hodl. I do get some cash ready in case it drops further than 2300. in the very unlikely case it dips below 1800 again, possibly retracing to 1300 which is support line, I'll just hodl.. The general condition and the unstalling of bitcoin development are such good indicators that something really terrible unpredictable would need to happen for bitcoin not to crush 3k and move way beyond in 3-6 months, and that's worst case. best case we will not even ever see 2.5k let alone 2k again. my2sat

good observation, who knows, I think there is a good chance they will slowly find out that the top down model they grew into was only superimposed, and not something inherently necessary. yes, for classic investors to come to btc, they would have to re-evaluate quite a few of their assumptions about markets, hierarchies, governance and regulation. what if bitcoin goes to show there can be a functioning sustainable non hierarchical market-layer which needs no governance whatsoever? bitcoin will probably get manipulated a lot in the future, but it does not matter for hodlers, cause any attempt to manipulate its price will only cost money to those who sell. will people demand regulation then? I think it's wrong to call for regulation, but we'll see. one thing is for sure though: the longer bitcoin just refuses to go away, the more legacy investors will try and get their feet wet with btc, can't hurt to put 1% into it, right? and so it starts

well, the usd is backed by the us-military. if bitcoiners proclaimed a state, a country without terrority, but claiming the world as our homogenous single marketplace, and we trained our own hitmen, I guess we'd become the biggest mafia of this world, and there would be little reason not to take us seriously :) just planing seeds guys, just planting seeds ;) but I think it would be a little overkill, I think bitcoin needs no army to be backed by, it is like water, you can not fight it. the fact that the usd needs the military to have value (look up petro-dollar empire) shows how much of a treacherous value system it makes for, and how wasteful it is in securing its position. basically, usd are stuffed down the throats of many countries, men and children, against their will, and with the full force of the us-armed forces. the ultimate mafia. but yeah, as I said, we could do this better, but we don't even need to. unless the US conquers the whole world, bitcoin will erode its power somewhen down the road. and we will have a world with less suffering. nobody can convince me the world wouldn't be less violent without the US policing it. sorry fellow americans, but you are the roman empire, and like the roman empire, you will have become victim of your own hubris. my2satoshi :)

currently we only have 2 measurable problems:
* Bitcoin miner centralization
* Effects of bitcoin popularity and growth (full blocks, high fees)
with the simple solution of the big block camp we will have
* Bitcoin miner centralization
* Bitcoin node centralization
in a perfect world, both camps would come together and agree on firing the miners, so that everyone can use their graphics card again to earn bitcoins.
and then, we need to find good metrics on how much internet speeds and hard disk spaces grow per year (and really be thorough with this) and implement a blocksize growth scale via code
this would end all of these debates. but only if we also fire the miners, that are already threatening the state of Bitcoin and most likely fueling the r/btc's "just increase blocks" approach.
on the sidelines: SegWit solves many problems with Bitcoin, so why not add it too. if some centralization happens on a 2nd layer of Bitcoin, so what?
compared to 
* Bitcoin miner centralization
* Bitcoin node centralization
it's nothing.

market is simply greedy, whereas greed in this case means buying btc from alts, not fiat. when they get their bcc, and there is even the slightest glitch during all this, expect these guys to dump both bcc and btc for their alt of choice. if the price will not rise another $300 til tomorrow, expect it to drop into a range of $2000-2500, if there is a big mess or chinese miners switch to mining bcc, I dare not call the bottom, but since $1300 is clearly a support, it could go there as well before rising again. if bcc does not die quickly, I can't see things looking good shortterm..

I had similar thoughts, but yours are far more structured than mine. the mtgox loss was way bigger than the btc-e loss, and we don't even know of the btc-e loss will stay a loss - if the bad guy behind the goxening is caught, chances must be high coins should/could be reimbursed? so many questions .. also, I would never rely on an exchange, I rely on bitcoin working, and math..they way it is supposed to be, I am not sure what I should make of these exchanges going bust news...in a technical way it has somewhat nothing to do with bitcoin, but it affects it in another way. weird.

don't worry, only way to gain influence over bitcoin at this stage is manipulation, more sophisticated forms of manipulation and FUD will come up with bigger players entering the game, expect fake news and all kinds of scare tactics to temporarily tilt the markets enriching the ones organizing and spreading the fud, because this is the only way how you can get the coins of others at this point, except outcompeting bitmain, which will probably happen rather soon, too.
so just don't buy into fud, ideally don't even check the price and consider the amount you invested in bitcoin as an expense/loss, then you might wake up to a nice surprise a few years down the road..

@_date: 2017-05-25 05:31:56
cause it is, a security vulnerability to the Bitcoin decentralization model, where each actor is free to act in self-interest, and all the other actors keep everyone else in check. a chance to game the system brings this equilibrium out of balance and thus is a security threat to all Bitcoin users.
I hope the UASF will kick bitmain in the BUTT

@_date: 2017-07-19 13:15:56
if they ever profited from the swings, they merely took away coins from weak hands, morally not so cool and market manipulation sucks, but as s hodler you can just �� at this. if one can't stomach the swings, bitcoin is not for them, also to note: bitcoin adoption goes rampant and will even increase towards fall/winter, so one might speculate whether bitmain's strategy lost them more money by a lower overall price compared to what they could make trying to game the network..just imagine, price could be at 10k by now, all those juicy mining fees they missed out on.. higher price means more profit for miners. so, it is more likely this was more about bruised egos than manipulation. maintaining egos is very expensive in all kinds of markets and businesses, not just bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:45:29
probably the wrong time to point out: don't take BTC for granted, sure it has proven it can mature, but right now we are facing the question whether it can scale. that being said, it still remains experimental, some kind of  never discovered bug might simply just destroy it.. as always only invest and hold as much as you'd be ok with losing worst case.

omg, did I really hurt your feelings? it was just a friendly reminder, no flexing muscles intended, in fact I consider myself constantly learning as well, bitcoin is new technology, nobody gets it completely, I am just saying that it really helps to have a lot of experience and time spent in the space to make educated guesses on what is happening. also "is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem." if you are an outsider, maybe better start off at r/bitcoinbeginners - no offense!

@_date: 2017-07-11 17:45:19
nobody bothers to do fiat&lt;-&gt;altcoin, so basically bitcoin is the backing currency for any altcoin, given the centralization of most other coins, nobody would seriously consider any of them as a groundbraking alternative to bitcoin, so if bitcoin dips, altcoin space plummets. on the flip side, altcoins are mostly so low in market cap, that some bitcoiners gamble with a small percentage of their btc with altcoins, which makes the altcoin space seem to rise faster than bitcoin, but then again, altcoins are locked to bitcoin somehow, it's weird.

easily understandable translation for every small bitcoin holder who wants bitcoin to go to 6000+ within 2017:
fire up a BIP148 node, spread the word that you take part in writing history, 'maybe' try to convince your favourite exchange to run BIP148 or else you do business with an exchange that does.
if you don't understand any of this, or why it is important, and still hold bitcoins in good faith, expecting it will continue to rise: don't be so sure about that. bitcoin needs responsible people in its userbase, or it is doomed.
apart from the just said: running a node is easy, everyone can do it, and in this case you would play a role in convincing exchanges to run it too, and if they do, SegWit will activate, which will lower fees, then Lightning Network will, and Rootstock, and all the super cool things that we can not right now because miners are blocking it to make more short term profit on fees etc...
teach them a lesson, educate yourselves, run a BIP148 node, be part of history :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:19:59
you need to read a LOT more to be able to have some kind of qualified opinion on this :) as someone who knows the space for quite some time, your questions don't pierce any of the real subjects at hand and seem like you have become a victim of buzzwords like BIP148, "satoshi's original vision", BCC, "paypal" you need to learn what these are and what bitcoin is, and what went on since its beginning! and you'll see many of the points you brought up are super irrelevant, no offense, nice effort you made, but you already stated you are an outsider, thanks for sharing what impression outsiders get of the current situation, it is what I would expect :)

glad I could clarify - now consider running a BIP148 node at your home on some old spare notebook, and possibly also use this node to receive and send Bitcoins - this way we all protect our investment, which is basically based on the idea of decentralization, and without it not worth much more than a bank account..
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:12:24
the money isn't yours even if you store it under your pillow, the money really belongs to the bank, it has never been sold, only loaned to people and governments, at interest, of course. we don't live in a world where one can *own* fiat money, be it on a bank account, or under the mattress..in most countries the legal system is even skewed towards real estate ownership, it can be confiscated. the only few things you can really own are things you can hide, like gold, and bitcoin.

it is only $200 above what goldman sachs predicted as the next high (after having predicted the low correctly) so maybe the big pocket guys don't bother with low liquidity exchanges and rather pay a premium prices beyond 10k anyways? pretty realistic if SW activates, was predicting 10k+ prices with segwit already in april/may - that being said, we should bot give goldman too much credit it could haunt us later ;)

@_date: 2017-07-19 17:32:05
nothing to be grateful about, but to make sure they stick to the game, keep on running these nodes. coinbase recently said they won't support a potential HF chain, so all is looking good, but: don't trust, verify. running a BIP148 node means you stop verifying stalling tactics after aug1st :) if you want to thank someone, thank the miners who started mining on BIP148, even if at a loss!
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:22:20
yeah, kind of, of course you are only speculating on prices to be higher, there is no guarantee for anything in this market, in any market really, but after a 84%+ drop in bitcoin, it's been a good time to buy historically, given enough time in the market.. as always only invest what you can afford to lose, unless you work for a bank. as a bank you can invest what the people that bail you out can't afford to lose. ;)
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:31:46
what do you mean by "matter here" matter for what? I was just genuinely curious :) if you still care about bitcoin's basic value proposition and the importance of trustless decentralized money in the crypto space, then consider mining bitcoin again on a BIP148 node to prevent stalling of protocol development by too powerful mining entity!
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:00:59
have you ever thought about using this thing, instead of just speculating on gains? how about you travel to some country and instead of using atms, you just talk up locals and tell them you got some bitcoin, may they give you local currency in exchange? that's what makes this valuable. also, try to protect the network, it relies on decentralization and people being informed enough to understand how valuable running their own node is, processing transactions, in exchange for some hardware and some electricity, and if you want to go balls deep all in on bitcoin, then start mining from super cheap hydro or wind-power. this is what makes bitcoin valuable, not speculation.
if you are a fool, then only insofar that you thought you can just buy into this and expect it to eternally rise, this is not a 0-sum game, this is a win-win-game, as your gains in wealth are linked to gains in adoption, so, what have you done in 2018 to spread adoption/awareness?
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:40:51
just saying, I wanna see the shrink he needs when bitcoin goes omnipresent. the interent does not forget and if you put your face out there, you better talk sense. and if you stick your face to something that could become known and used more than the USD, well shit, they'll make movies about one of the most deluded fraudulent idiots in the space. no psyche can deal with that long-term..just some thoughts..I really hope for him, that the space will just lose interest and forget him at some point. what he did for bitcoin is rather irrelevant, putting up a clownshow is not doing anything for bitcoin, he just got in early and promoted the shit out of it, which was most likely to enrich himself, not for bitcoin per se. also, if the people he lured into bitcoin, lost bitcoins at mtgox, which he defended, well, then what good was his contribution?

@_date: 2017-05-28 00:51:51
wading through the comments gets me aids, so, stop it!
there are two ways to scale Bitcoin: the right one, and the political one!
Bitcoin will scale on-chain, and on-chain + 2nd layer! from an engineering standpoint it is idiotic to do the former first, especially via hardfork to x right now, since we got an ad nauseam tested SegWit already.
again, there are huge interests on the politcal end of all of this to stall SegWit, I suspect for one Asicboost, and for else juicy high miner fees to be the motivation!
so everyone stfu and go for the technically/engineering-wise best solution!  &amp; BIP148 now.

well, there are two more bitcoin adoption waves ahead, currently corporate and finance is trying to load up on bitcoin, most likely using the scaling debate to suppress the price, goldman even predicting the 1900 low, and futures trading at $3800, after that, and bitcoin most likely already trading at $10k+, bitcoin will be promoted at scale to the people you are trying to talk to, that's when they'll buy, around $100k a pop ;) I never started to talk people into bitcoin, why would I, it is a nice idea, lots of potential, highly speculative, and worst case a new world government covertly centralized blockchain to bind and chain them all to one ledger ;) just enjoy the ride and the feeling from being in charge of your own money, being your own bank. that being said, when banks and media start to promote bitcoin at scale, I'll probably diversify hard ;)

maybe, nobody really knows whether jihan is just having a heyday messing with us or not, he definitely gets way more attention than he deserves but that's the problem when one mining entity controls or influences or extorts more than 50% of hash power. either he is sacked by chinese officials and is out to destroy bitcoin, or he uses his hash-granted power to manipulate the market. he won't win any fairplay contests but he probably does not give a flying..
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:48:54
the really revolutionary about all this is that for the first time in history, nations of the world have lost control over money issuance, and also monetary determination, like: one is not allowed to do business in anything other than currency x in country y. now, finally, you can tell the money masters and master scamsters to screw themselves. bitcoin is an opt out of centralized oppression of the poor, as it gives back freedom and frees markets to everyone. so country x is sanctioned by country y? bitcoin could not care less. you can bring millions now through the airport without ever being detected. exciting a.f. times. but also dangerous times, as in the past, whenever something challenged the monetary status quo, the money masters got vile and angry, they can’t allow their candy to be taken away, can they? think about aggression of taxi drivers vs uber, times 10000. personally I am pretty convinced that the only way to effectively get rid of this is to completely waste all societies and economies, cause chaos, and then offer a new solution, create a totalitarian world society or something, just to try to get rid of crypto, that is, if they can’t buy in cheap enough to manipulate it enough...maybe this was a little tinfoil-hat-y ;)

everyone wants SW by now...some still want a quick untested unprepared HF, I don't. I know core devs are do a good job, we all know this. there is no more reason to stall and wiggle around UASF - and to answer the question, the users had enough of the scaling debate and concluded they want to push for an UASF, if it sparks any interest with businesses and miners, it will likely be a success and we can increase base block-size later *if needed*, at least this is how I would like it to happen. sure it would be safer to continue discussing and compromising on technical arguments, but I don't want this. you don't do tech by compromise, you do politics and social stuff by compromise. this is not about politics or social shit, this is about tech and efficiency, and ultimately math. screw people and egos. they screwed up each and every fucking time in history, this time I don't want something good and beautiful get destroyed or even limited by politics and egos...I'm just an end-user running a node, but I want my anger and frustration to be noted, and I count on core devs not to be anyhow conspiring to destroy bitcoin or whatever baseless BS rbtc is spewing - MASF, UASF, or the highway. especially in this bitmain-situation I'd rather risk running bitcoin into the ground with my actions than wait any longer for reasonable progress. luke was probably thinking something similar when he picked up on shaolinfry's tool...either this or nothing, I mean, what is the friggin alternative to a working decentralized bitcoin anyways? friggin eth? what a joke!

we'll see, I doubt the current or future core developers will be able to fckup the code so heavily, that a forkcoin would ever take over in market-cap, until then, the real bitcoin is the one with the highest market cap, pretty easy to understand for any shop-owner, don't you think? the real bitcoin attracts the best heads in the space, has the most solid security, market reach, and it reflects via market-cap and all other coins are merely following bitcoin in market cycles, doesn't sound so confusing now, does it?
but generally I agree that the best way to fight something that is otherwise very antifragile, is to cause division among their proponents, the oldest trick in politics is the "divide and conquer" policy, so if anyone wanted to challenge bitcoin, one would need to carefully time and execute attacks on what people define as "the real bitcoin", this becomes especially more relevant, the more intelligent the attackers get, now roger ver is not the smartest dude out there, but there will be others. thankfully cypherpunks are amongst the most intelligent nonfuckwithable people on the planet, and this project basically revolves around intelligent people understanding the true value of monetary self-determinism, based in math, set in stone, or chains so to speak. basically this is a network of smart dudes outcompeting each others for the smartest most logical and efficient solution to engineering problems regarding public key cryptography and appliance to the real world. so to satisfy the attack-vector of confusion, one would need to ramp up propaganda and lies to a whole different level than it happened with the bitcoin cash joke, and in the end it would hit a wall of logic and engineering reason. the basic assumptions of what bitcoin needs to be in order to be the real bitcoin are very clear to the original cypherpunks who understood why we need a non-inflationable, censorship resistant value transfer system. and then a clown like roger ver came by and said we spat on the grave of the messiah by now having low enough fees for this censorship resistant value transfer system, and thus it will die so we better quickly implement a fix that will speed up adoption while sacrificing some decentralisation and thus censorship resistance. there were lots of discussions and drama, and I was a vocal part about it, but in the end it really all boiled down to engineering problems and their makro-effects on the whole system. 
so basically I could not care less that there are so many copycats, the thing that was slitghtly annoying is that the copycats were so vocal about it, almost propagandist, while the other "side" was super levelheaded and in every argument tried to apply reason while the other side tried to apply passion and emotions. the talks with roger ver over the "scaling debate" last summer were some of the most annoying crap I had to wade through cause that guy would argued like a 6 yr old that just got robbed of candy.
so again, is this bad for bitcoin? no, *unless* people become more and more ignorant about bitcoin and what makes it valuable. ignorance kills everything, even the best of our cultural achievements can be dismantled and disrupted by ignorance. this is why current global politics are, as always, driven by division, and the abolition of cultures, and mixing all cultures up, but I digress..

the problem with it is if saves you about 20% electricity costs, if the profit margin is 1% this means you make about 1900-2000% more profit than your competitors, your competitors and you are supposed to be on an even playing field, but you just outcompete them and cause mining monopoly/patent/centralization. yes this needs to stop asap, as a regular bitcoin user this disgusts me, but mining in general being locally concentrated in China is also not so nice..SW would level the playing field a little more and in long term nanometer transistor manufacturing process limitation will level the asic production and make Bitcoin mining decentralized again, so no urgent need for a pow change, but activating SW is quite a bit more pressing, thus I support the UASF

@_date: 2017-05-24 06:37:50
what do you mean, boycotted for political reasons? why should a company boycotted then? or are politics not allowed now? yes, maybe the BU camp uses dirty tricks, well, not just maybe, but definitely.
I am not suggesting a dirty trick or something. I am just informing people that what certain companies do, might be against their own interest. and if it comes to economic majority, people are key, so they should vote with their wallet, which means literally not buying into their business model/plans.
I am not sure if I can follow your argumentation, I don't see myself in a which-hunt and I don't call for riots and have no pitchfork in my hand.
before I made this post, this whole agreement was bs and not even worthy of any kind attention, I completely &amp; categorically ignored it, I think I have not even read it. everything that has come from bitmain or roger, and I still sometimes check his twitter, completely lost them all credibility for me, this goes so far that I categorically refuse any seemingly serious attempt of communication, because all I can see is stalling, asicboost and miner fee earnings. so why should I waste my time staying up to date about these fake compromise attempt, whose only goal is to veil the true intention of a prolonged stall?
I also disregard the technical merit of the "agreement", and I must also disregard what you said about SW+2MB and 2018 yadda yadda..
I hope you don't take this personal or anything but you must understand my position, I have figured out over the last months, that certain actors are good at hiding bs in nice dresses, but it is still bs!
and we all have a nice no bs tool now, which is a UASF - taklshow time is over, August 1st things move forward for Bitcoin.
I am not sure what you think of this whole debate, but aren't you sick of it too? and let me know why you defend those companies, sure we are all in Bitcoin space, and I hope in a few months nobody will hold a grudge against anyone else anymore, hell, I don't want to demonize roger ver or jihan, I'd be definitely down for a beer with them! but I would not let them have much say about a multi pillar decentralized global value system, because I think their personalities are not mature enough to handle such a fragile thing with enough care, and would brake it! I would not want george w. bush be the president of Bitcoin either for similar reasons.
I don't know what the problem is. you really hit the nail on the had with "boycott" though, it made me reconsider if I did anything wrong, or even amoral.
well hell, I would love if all companies and startups in Bitcoin could prosper! but it should be clear as glass that companies, that rely on a theoretical use case of Bitcoin, for which it would need to change in a way, which seriously would treaten not just one, but in summa two pillars of its decentralization model, then hell no it must be prevented for the safety and integrity of the network!
so to end my argumentation. my call for boycott is not founded in political reasons, but technical, no, even ideal ones! because supporting them means threatening the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin, and bitcoin tokens themselves. or am I wrong that people are here because Bitcoin is so cool and non censorable and decentralized? well guess what, mining, one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value proposition is already compromised, because it's too centralized, and even worse, there is an actor, who even most likely exploits a trick to get an almost 2000% profit boost from his mining operation, and he clearly and overtly opposes and blocks any Bitcoin progress that would make it impossible to do this "cheating" covertly!
guess why!
:) don't go back there buddy :D the community will unite again once everyone figured out the bad actors, there is only so much bs one can spread before it eventually comes back bites you in the tail ;)

I disagree, the reasons for satoshi to disrupt currencies and banks is cause the old system sucked, now if bitcoin ever sucked as bad as political money, sure somedev will disrupt it, but until there is little incentive to do so, also you keep mentioning “better than” and “superior bitcoin” define a superior version of bitcoin, I can’t imagine one. can’t see demand for radical improvements, and since this is open source, something only slightly better, whatever “better” means, will not replace bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:39:55
1. mining hardware will level out as we hit nanometer restrictions, there is likely not going to be mining centralisation happening, also wherever you have excess free energy, you can take that for mining, say people living close to mountains (hydropower). this is a strong decentralizing force.
2. never figured they are unwilling, what change even? bitcoin is already the possibly most ideal solution to a problem that is decentralized trustless money. it takes time and lots of thought to approach this without messing it up.
3. the majority of people don't understand the internet and gave all their private details to mark zuckerberg. most people don't understand electricity yet use computers and smartphones. regarding misinformation: yes this is a problem, but it is a problem for all systems in the world, the "non-informed" usually mess things up. this is why you don't find religious fundamentalism in places with lots of, well "enlightenment". bitcoin is open source though, anyone with a brain can figure out and defend its values, which is required for this to work out long term I guess..
4. there's prestige as an incentive, having your name connected to something that might outlast the next 20 generations of your offspring is kinda cool I guess. this is a once in a lifetime project, nobody knows if it will be around in the future, or even if we will be still around when it gets adopted by superhuman AI, something we will have created.
5. there will be no more than 21 million coins, this one of the very basic promises that every participant accepts, I for one would immediately sell if it become clear this thing became inflationary, and so would many, if not all others. the community decides on this, and while theoretically it would be possible, it won't happen just like that. scarcity is an interesting point. I see it like this: yes, there is no scarcity of other blockchains, forks, and copy-coins. the will probably never go away, and they probably shouldn't, I don't think they can compete for value though, as they are also only maintained by humans, and thus it is to be excepted that bitcoin attracts the higher quality devs. when it comes to experimental projects like cryptos, I would not trust people who merely copy and fork a project and make their own coins, with any significant amount of my wealth. bitcoin has not just first mover advantage, but it is also the most trustworthy of all alt-coins out there. and it's the oldest. never change a running system, right? not to mention the highest hash-rate security of them all.
you say "better coins will come around" define better? the only complaint a few very vocal proponents of the infamous "scaling debate" was that fees got too high cause too many people used bitcoin at the same time. now, I call this something to celebrate rather than to complain, but hey, I guess we make some quick rash changes, and hotfix bitcoin, right? well, uh, no, that's not how you do this kind of what they call public key distributed cryptography..
to sum it up: bitcoin is the king of the hill, undisputed, for a good reason: it kept working as it was intended. it will retain this position until it fails, or some people lose money, with money I mean bitcoins, not equivalent fiat value like USD.
so what this means: why quit a relationship, if your girl is good to you and never cheated on you? you just don't.
btw I did not down-vote you, you have very common concerns that need to be addressed from time to time, although  your arguments are rather lackluster and weak which gave me the impression you might be trolling a little in the hopes of pushing this to cheaper prices so you can load up more? ;)

whoa, you are blowing my mind and cementing my tilt towards the UASF in the scaling debate ;) - I really disagree that BTC as a currency failed, I think your perception that people just  to make mere profits is off too. why would they risk it if bitcoin were not somehow worth more than just some ponzi or tulip mania? I think you underestimate people, the info is out there and they are educating themselves. sure in surges like these they come in masses and some come because of FOMO, or because they heard of the 2013 rise and did not bother to further check out bitcoin...but that does not change anything about how this baby works under the hood :) - thank you for further justifying my position in the scaling debate, I really hope you will join slushpool and signal for UASF - it will be the best for bitcoin long term, tell your buddies! bitcoin will be about buying and spending again, it will have the store-of-value-gold-layer, and the pay-coffee-at-starbucks-silver-layer and we will all be heroes :D *optimism*

I don't think there will be a fork, miners have no interest in a fork, nobody really has, but the reasons not to activate SegWit are becoming so thin that the UASF guys will follow through, no matter what. if you want some game theory: the SegWit-blockers have less reason to follow through with their threats and arguments than the UASF guys have to follow through with their threats and arguments, threat being UASF.. this alone should make the SegWit blockers and/or confused miners fold their hand and mine SegWit, most likely shortly before aug 1st, and thus help the UASF to succeed and finally give Bitcoin much needed upgrades which will most likely result in prices beyond $10k...for anyone who does not know this by now it is better to sell 50% of their bitcoin ;) - that being said, I would really welcome a less radical solution before aug 1st. I will not even hold any grudges in to any in the space, including ver and jihan, may they do their business their way...I just think it will not work out for them before aug 1st.. :)

bitcoin is not even digital gold if the only clearlinghouse for this gold is in jihan, protected by a patent, enforced by a state. this is not the situation we are in, but this is the situation we will be in, if bitmain succeeds in blocking SegWit any longer and continues to make 19-20times more profit than honest miners. this creates a monopoly, and once mining is totally monopolized we only have a really messy PoW change as an option - it might be too late by then. nobody wants digital gold if the gold certificates are signed by a central state controllable entity.. SegWit was tested, brings a lot of upgrades and opens the space to new innovators and businesses and uses cases, AND unclogs the mainchain, potentially lowering fees.
this is what I signed up for, and I must assume this is what Bitcoin is all about, right? decentralized global trustless permissionless cash system &amp; store of value - you get none of the features unless "decentralized" stands as the first line of defense.
don't get me wrong, I was, for months, very undecided about this issue, I also thought "doing nothing, Bitcoin is doing fine, why risk it" was the best way. little did I know about asicboost back then! also: Bitcoin is a multi billion dollar payment network. with the upgrades it is about to get, while increasing its level of decentralization (hard to measure, I know..) it will most likely become a multi trillion dollar payment network - it is worth the (small) risk.

prestige I guess, and the conviction that if bitcoin would fail, all crypto will fail, which I am convinced of too. basically the idea is that in the unlikely scenario bitcoin would fail, the reason why it would fail, would very very probably be the same for why altcoins would fail too, does not even have be a technical one. in fact I doubt it would be a technical one.
say bitcoin fails cause people get ignorant and stupid about it, and people as well as devs lose interest, and it gets slowly submerged by big corporate or banks and media put so much pressure on bitcoin, that these guys can buy bitcoin dirt cheap and then control 51% of the coins or something to manipulate the markets and ultimately control this. well, you see, they can do this with every altcoin. and the reason for this kind of failure is mere ignorance of users and the community.
so, I am not in the least worried that neither an altcoin would surpass bitcoin, or devs lose interest in bitcoin. it's the name of the game and it's as fresh as it was in 2009. I am slightly worried about the idiot-attack vector, but this one applies to really every market and a ton of other things. a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and believe it or not, even though bitcoin is highly decentralized and shared, one of its weakest links is/are still humans, users/investors in this case. users for example have no idea how dangerous it really is to leave coins on exchanges, essentially setting them up to get hacked all at the same time, or raided by political groups, interest, you know. now, if there are millions of coins on exchanges, and they suddenly get controlled by one guy, or one entity, like, a group of people, then you got a problem. if you knew for example, that 60% of bitcoins are in control of banks, would you still hold any bitcoin? I for one would switch to an alt-coin in that case, as I don't think banks need to get even more power and influence over money than they already have. so, let's just hope bitcoin users play their part and use this thing responsibly.

The best device around is to take  some amount from the bed habit of yours, and put it into btc, other good advisors tell you to never invest more than you would be willing to lose. so ideally if you can take the money of the few beers or a pack of zigs or some fast food money,  and would not feel bad worst case

lots of assumptions there...it is stupid to invest ones live savings in bitcoin, plain and simple, this thing is still experimental and could go belly up anytime.. that being said, the small amount I invested some time ago amounts to more than I would be willing to lose now, thus I start getting more involved in making sure bitcoin stays valuable, which means finding out exactly how it works, knowing what gives it value, and making sure it stays as decentralized as possible. I am not even opposed to a PoW change if mining is not going to re-decentralize.


one can not compete with its 2000% profitability gain, if there is a way tell me. asicboost is patented thus brings the state actor into mining by protecting this technology. any asic manufacturer trying to outfit their miners with this technology could potentially be sued.


it prevents or allows for a fix for covert asicboost which in the end dampens it's use insofar everyone can see if you use it. also check out this:  - greg maxwell apparently has a fix ready which needs SegWit afaik

this is exactly why I would not want miners to influence protocol development. they care about profits, and they are supposed to by the way the network is set-up (whitepaper) sure nobody has seen pools and ASICs coming, but now that we have it, and still everyone in mining cares about ROI, who really expects them to have far-sight?  so we can have a network that keeps these guys doing work to earn money and protect the network with hashes, and let others continue to earn nothing but fame and prestige do their best to protect it with technical knowledge &amp; far-sight...anyone still object?

no, it has value because it is immutable and decentralized, no single actor can change it - in theory. it loses all of its use cases unless the first ones are preserved. people trust in this, because they trust in math. it is open source. these are the values of bitcoin, don't fool yourself, being scarce or usable means nothing if the scarcity and usability is not built on solid fundaments of decentralization and openness. there is some validity to your point "the fact that it is nearly impossible to change is a feature" yes. this is good. but by disregarding the urgency of SegWit and thus shutting down asicboost you are betting on the possibility that a single entity controlling more than 51% of the mining space is not a threat to bitcoin! yes, we can do a PoW change if that happens, but, is it worth it risking that?
what is the smaller risk: having to do a PoW change in 12 months or doing a UASF now?
if you can tell me reasons why bitmain will not take over bitcoin mining long term because of his 20x profit boost tool, then tell me: are there more efficient asic power saving tools out there than bitmain's to compete with his?

first it needs to bounce back from the recent unreasonable drop in price, miners are probably trying to scare the markets to get some cheap coins, markets still uncertain, so it might wobble a bit, but I would not be surprised if it tested 3000 soon again, but depending on how much people get scared by miners, it might also test a little lower too, idk maybe 2400 again, or just 2500? who knows!

you complain that nobody is shilling for status quo? a status where one entity in mining will dominate all of mining 2 years down the road, basically making the purpose of mining totally useless in bitcoin? how about we stop or at least stop the stalling of stopping this, because this is what happens, and that's why luke picked up on the BIP148 idea again, which was not his btw, but shaolinfry's - it's like a "screw it, let the users / economy decide if they are ok with mining stopping progress of bitcoin", and this is what is happening, nothing more, what's the problem?

the main reason why I support BIP148 is because I think it is a bigger risk to wait another year or more allowing asicboost to centralize bitcoin-mining even further, then not going for it. also, the fees are unbearably high right now, this can not sustain another year, but I might be wrong. just my personal take on the situation. in general, if there is a change or a way to increase decentralization of bitcoin, I am actively in favor of it, and would also push it. preventing (covert) asicboost is such a thing.

I've been saying this for a while, max reasonable pre segwit price given current adoption, media attention, and technical maturity of the whole space, is below 6k, everything above is 'bubble territory' for me. also, compare the charts with nov2013 to get a good sense how many times the price must multiply before people get nervous..so yes, price is justified, with SW I expect it to go over 10k maybe even before end of 2017, nobody can afford not to get in by then - but pre SW, max 6k, maybe even only 5k..post sw bubble prices are hard to predict. it really comes down to how hard we will scale, if we get all the cool SW stuff and bitcoin gets supercharged, so will the price. still if it goes to 25k before end of 2017, even with SW and super useful features, I would call it a bubble, but it doesn't make sense making predictions that far ahead...

well, to be fair, bitcoin does not need to scale to stay nr.1 - both scaling solutions bear risk, from my research SW and possibly even BIP148 is the least risky way to go forward, I sure hope miners wake up and cause a MASF. (if you wonder why bitcoin is not rivaled by eth, check out how long it has been running without hiccups, and then compare that to the DAO fiasco. ethereum has a lot of appeal, on paper, bitcoin has it already, and just needs to decide whether to act quick to fend off miner centralization or not..there is no competing with a fully functioning and decentralized bitcoin, looks like I'm a bitcoin maximalist ;)

@_date: 2017-06-16 21:36:19
there is no best way to tell, yes, these are turbulent times, but if you believe in bitcoin long term, there is no best time to buy :) - if you are here since quite a while, now is probably a good time to take some profits or watch from the sidelines with 50% of your stash or something..in times of relatively high uncertainty I usually keep doing this, I give up a few of my satoshis and set up buy orders on an exchange, all the way down to a price I think it could fall to, if the trend reverses, just cancel the buy orders and instabuy - this never made me any significant gains though, but it prevents hair-loss :D not sure if anyone can recommend this in the current case, as bitmain jihan could just hardfork his coin and cause a lot of trouble. but then, we should not listen to this clown, but many do! that's the problem with clowns, they are so effective at attracting attention ;) here is my humble prediction to the price in the next few weeks: we oscillate between 2500 and 2000, possibly a couple times. if some really bad news comes around and we go below 1900, it will drop to 1400 as some analysts think there is no support between 1900 and 1300...if this happens I will definitely buy more coins as I believe in bitcoin long term...once all these shenanigans are over bitcoin will probably multiple in price just like eth did, and since SegWit is so cool eth will probably fall significantly..

he is the head of the most influential mining company in china, bitmain* it is estimated he and his pools control close to 60% of hash rate. he could become so powerful because it is hard to change bitcoin, because labor and materials in china are so cheap, and cause nobody was really paying attention to miner centralization while the price rose from $200 to $3000...also people all looked at mtgox as a threat. many gave their attention to these things. now we have a load of work ahead, and the solution could get ugly, it all depends on whether jihan acts in self interest or is a chinese government puppet and bitmain covertly run by communist republic of china..needless to say china has no interest in a decentralized money for their people, and since most mining is in china, you can probably see the problem. I really hope this is just all about segwit and asicboost, cause asicboost allows bitmain to mine with way more profit than other miners, and he may not want to lose this edge..I hope it is all clearer to you now, if not ask more :)

mining is low profit margin, about 1%, the main deciding factor is the cost of electricity. asicboost allows you to save 20% of your electricity costs. watch this,  or read this:
so you earn $1million in mining, of which $990.000 are costs in electricity, -&gt; you earn $10.000. if you save 20% on electricity by using ASICboost, you suddenly earn $190.000 or $200.000, a factor of 19x, or 20x - **so, 20x it is**. do you think everyone would freak out of some miner would only make 20% more than the rest? it is 2000% more ffs.. :) did I mention ASICboost is patent protected so other ASIC manufacturers can not implement it?...did I mention this means that a state granted monopoly is about to emerge, or has already emerged in bitcoin mining?
this ASICboost thing is the single biggest reason why I have become a little UASF militant tbh...if anyone can dismantle this argument I would be happy to hear it. like, what other kinds of power optimizations are there, and are they patented as well? I always counted on mining being fair in a way that everyone has to spend about the same amount of power per hash...but one saving 20% in a 1% margin endeavor means f-in 2000% edge over competitors...
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:29:38
this precedent thing has been going through my head as well, I would absolutely agree with the thought you brought up, but in this instance, the UASF must be seen as an emergency call to action, why? because we have a special situation with miners, one entity having used (unprovable afaik, but very very evident, check out  a patented 2000% profit edge-technology (asicboost) for multiple years to get into a monopoly-like position in the mine-field! this defeats the purpose of PoW consensus already before UASF could, and thus legitimizes the use of that mechanism imho. also, as a nice side-effect it allows users to get a taste of the medicine many newcomers invested in, by participating actively in the network and giving people a much necessary introduction into the importance of participation in all this. if you ask me, bitcoin needs way more nodes than 20000, ideally on home computers, I am thinking in millions here. not saying bitcoin node network is about to be attacked, but actors like jpmorgan and goldman sachs are very powerful and would be stupid not to do something against this emergent death threat to their fraudulent business models: bitcoin. banks are like herbalife if you will..oh and guess what, they are finding accomplices:

@_date: 2018-12-13 15:59:19
pretty accurate, but way to general. with the same argument, you could price stocks, gold, housing, sex, really just anything that has a price.., so the more accurate version would be "what the next person is willing to pay for it, given the set of values and promises the asset (bitcoin in this case) makes.
and the selling point, performance and values it harbors and "promises" it makes, are pretty clear and straightforward, one of which is "apolitical money" which is a biggie for me in a world where whole nations finance terrorism to perpetuate political agendas and geopolitical strategies. the other biggie for me is "censorship resistance value transfer" which will soon make me go all in if my bank keeps asking me questions about my dealings with crypto. you know, my bank, and everyone's bank, is part of a network that has value by controlling what has value, there is no boss in bitcoin, so I prefer something more decentralized, so nobody asks questions. like, uh you know, when someone decides iran are the bad guys, but I still want to spend my holidays there, but my bank won't let me cause "sanctions dude, don't go there, they are literally hitler, etc etc.." you know, idgaf and just use bitcoin.
anyways, there's a long list of features and properties that help one evaluating bitcoin, it's just that they got really lost in the last bull-run, as everyone was hyped about fiat equivalent gains, instead of being amazed at how bitcoin just works and throws out blocks every 10 minutes, reliable like a Japanese train, with no government involved, or should I say "with all governments involved, whether they want it or not" basically making governments irrelevant really.
people really underestimate bitcoin's core values, and if it ultimately succeeds, one bitcoin will have a purchasing power of about 1/21000000th of everything that is marketable. to be more precise, if bitcoin won't go away long-term, and people understand and trust it more and more, then the end-game of this is that all owners off all goods worldwide, will want to have all their wealth reflected with something that they trust as much as the original material goods themselves. right now this is the pool of international fiat moneys, but it could very well become bitcoin, unless some government decides to hack all exchanges at the same time, steal a huge portion of bitcoin, and in turn prevent future adoption cause "muh, the government owns 2 million bitcoin anyways." which brings me to the last point: REMOVE your coins from exchanges, or the powers that be control it, not you.

DON'T remind me, I had $500 spare in 2010 and read about bitcoin and thought this could be revolutionary, was about to invest $500 and a few 'europeans' in a 3d-graphics forum talked me out of it, said it was a scam, can't work government not gonna allow it yadda yadda, and I just forgot about it. but then again, I and many would probably have either lost it all at mtgox, and/or sold it at one of the crazy news/price swings back then. I mean if you buy at $30 and it goes to like $5 for no reason at all you question your sanity I guess. currently the system risk is way smaller, as it has matured, but to make the same crazy gains, you have to increase your initial risk capital, and I think this will happen with wealthies and institutional investors simply buying coins  with amounts in the hundreds of thousands to millions and more, instead of 500 bucks...

single person/coordinated groups, imagine this scenario: bitmain &amp; pools &amp; owners of all bitmain miners ever sold which include theoretical access to asicboost were to be offered access to exactly this feature for agreeing on policies. not saying it is happening, but ever heard of killswitch? valid points about urgency, jep, but unfortunately there is no way to measure how severe mining centralization is, and how much of a countermeasure is justified. and who is to judge anyways ;) anyways, I think the UASF is the best and safest solution of all I ever heard or thought of. if people lose money for not having been informed enough about the state of Bitcoin and the necessity for action and interaction, well then screw them. Bitcoin is no sit back and hodl club, ignorance destroys every oh so high horse idealistic project. also, Bitcoin can only be trustless as long as there are enough vocal and technically informed/skilled people joining the discourses around it with actual arguments. and the job of regular users is to tell baseless FUD apart from useful info. being responsible to to speak. if they can't, they have to trust someone, which defies the purpose of Bitcoin as being trustless. this is also why I think, ideally, mainstream adoption will be impossible unless all users learn code. thankfully new generations are learning to code in school so they can better tell apart bs from truth.

banking has quite a few safety nets. utility companies usually are depended on credit too, they need to buy foreign resources and most of trade happens by credit. no credit, no uranium, no oil, etc..it will be tough to get rid of international banking cancer, I call it cancer cause it is so inefficient and wasteful. the whole multi decade operation in the mid east is wasteful and sponsored by the same banks we want to get rid of. the world would be a more peaceful place without a global banking monopoly like we have today. on the other hand, every change in very basic parameters to our society, like the "who is in charge"- parameter, can and probably will cause turmoil. western societies gained some rather solid level of stability, but this this by completely selling out their sovereignty to a super powerful banking cartel. do we want to get rid of them and risk a little of the stability they kindly grant us, in order to gain freedom? or are we sheep by design and need a king?

the basics are hard to grasp, the way i see it there are pretty similar arguments on both sides, also it is not perfectly measurable which blocksize is the right one to go for, but it is pretty clear to most that a smaller blocksize allows for more decentralization, this is especially important as mining is currently very centralized. if too many pillars of the bitcoin decentralization model fall under control of one or few hands, there is no more reason to recommend it, as it could have become a corporate brand. I have been in both 'camps' and followed their arguing each time, it turned out I prefer node decentralization over bigger blocks, also there seem to be other problems involved with bigger blocks which makes it seem that segwit and 2nd layer transactions are the engineering-wise better way. but then the BU guys come with conspiracy theories and then the discussion usually ends.. ;) there is a lot of learning ahead of you :)

expect big price spikes once a few medium-big exchanges start opting for BIP148 - I see no reason why they would not do so, pretty sure they understand the ecosystem quite well, but they need time, and smaller exchanges making the first steps will act as icebreakers - miners will be happy too with lower relative fees but higher absolute prices - there will most likely be an oscillating equilibrium between convenient and more expensive on chain transactions, and less convenient but very cheap 2nd layer transactions. by making bitcoin grow as a whole both "sides" will profit more than by stagnation of bitcoin development. what this means for hodlers: moonlike conditions. :D does this all have to come by august 1st? well, I want bitcoin to get updated once in a while to adapt to changing conditions or to respond to centralization threats like covert asicboost. so, in my opinion yes. but, only if it is safe enough. from what I could gather, UASF is safe enough if it gets enough support, which brings us to the beginning of this post. in the end it all comes down to understanding code. fortunately bitcoin is open source, so wysiwyg - if exchanges want to make educated decisions on wether to run UASF or not, they should hire coders and programmers to give them a qualified neutral opinion whether or not to run this. what do you think?

its one of the first questions I asked myself about bitc, and the answer is: will you give your bitcoin to them? supply and demand, they would need to pay crazy prices, even go bankrupt and have the public bail them out via bitcoin, the price would be around $1million by then..it would be either defeat or suicide for banks to try to buy out the market, maybe they could buy big chunks, cause temporary spikes and then set up huge mega shorts while using the buddies from MSM to create panic, but if you are a hodler and ride out the waves, they are screwed. all this assumed bitcoin keeps chugging along and stays decentralized.

there will always be people trying to confuse other people in an attempt to profit. with a little research and understanding though comes peace of mind. the fact that bitcoin did not die from a takeover-attempt by a few very vocal sales pitchers and known con artists, on the subject of acute growth pains (increased fees) and even having a very nimble levelheaded and elegant solution for the issue (lightning network) in the pipelines, clearly shows how antifragile bitcoin is. sure some people fell for their propaganda, but uneducated people buying into something during a hype-cycle are not the most rational decision-makers anyways.
so I completely disagree with your first point that ultimately all crypto is going to die from copycats and propagandists, lol, that would require for the whole humanity to drop below an IQ or 50 or something.

it's called legal tender for a reason. you are not allowed to use sound money for your business, or sell it. remember the liberty dollar? the operators introduced gold backed dollars in the mids of the US Fed cartel, and got raided and jailed.


Why not go the democratic way? If the system is as superior as you say, surely a majority will vote for it?
I was not very clear there, I meant "the only way to get rid of this (bitcoin) is to..."

where? which shop?
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:34:09
did I get this right, there is a trust that wants to sell you some token based on the price of bitcoin, without giving you a bitcoin, and you pay a 100% premium? wtf?

heard bitmain miners are remote kill-able, is this still a thing?
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:35:09
if anything this should be a wakeup call for miners..

the whole appeal of crypto is decentralization. also, altcoinmarkets with all their rather centralized and complex coins really just rely on bitcoin not debasing its value, which in and itself is based on the assumption that no single actor on the world can somehow hijack bitcoin. if bitcoin goes, the house of cards for alts will collapse too, except for maybe some coins that specifically target decentralization, but I only know of one that would apply...anyways, to answer your question: all it needs is bitcoin to screw up. if bitcoin screws up we are back to buying stocks as a means of "messing" with the system. the only thing stocks do is allowing average joe to not to get bent over and screwed by fiat money depreciation formula. what bitcoin allows the average joe is to take back what the banks have stolen from him and 4 generations before him. oh and about the 50% crash, everything can cause that, bitcoin is volatile, lots of speculators in the space / weak hands. if bitcoin does not screw up, or even if it just stays functioning as it is right now, it definitely has the potential to become the world's reserve currency, no rights reserved :) imagine, an open source software becoming the worlds reserve currency, I would not mind. but it would be dangerous a.f. you know why? if somehow some actor can covertly sneak in, and make it centralized under the hood, the world is going to get a king, and its people will be either obedient or slaves. I'm in bitcoin mostly because of the potential of total failure and total success, and how close these two actually can be of one another. it is the craziest thing since, idk, the invention of the wheel maybe ;)

they bicker about the debt ceiling, but really they know they can not not raise it, or the system would collapse into its own footprint at freefall speed, just like concrete skyscrapers sustaining extended fire damage :P

very exciting developments on the horizon, can't wait to get there! :)

BIP148 is a threat, a reasonable one, one against stalling, I think it is kind of necessary, I still hope for a MASF though...what is not necessary is Luke's rhetoric there. he is known to be an exceptional coder, let the code speak Luke, not words :)

is anyone running their full node through their service? found out you can not select the ports to be forwarded by any vpn, you get assigned a random port number through which all traffic is funneled..how do you deal with this? I am probably canceling my subscription because of the port assignment limitations.

these certain conditions are usually met, we already know how this works, your argument has about 15-25% validity, coming from someone not involved, just reading through the arguments. thus it would be fair to pay up at least .75BTC to the majority winner of the argument. also, if you bet that much money, you probably have 100s of bitcoins anyways, so cheap price to buy honor :)

jep you were missing something, not all miners are equal, some can use asicboost (20x more profitable mining), others can't
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:57:26
definitely a scam that has fooled hundreds of the most capable programmers working on it for years, even though being open source, there is a hidden make me rich switch that nobody found yet ;)

the focus on central bank issued money was a bit high around here in the last 2-3 years, if bitcoin is to really succeed, the focus will not be on the fiat equivalent anymore, but before this happens, it is probably going to get attacked, I don't think people are stupid enough to get subverted into using a derivative of bitcoin, instead of bitcoin by itself. and anything connected to banks (and the central banking system), means using a derivative.

hitting at the bottom is close to impossible unless you set up a buy array with a fixed amount you want to invest, like put x amount every 10 dollar change down to y price.

did all that - still a very strange problem, password recovery does not work as well, though the system seems to know me

checked my spam of course, still need to find how to contact support

seems like it worked on srware IRON - didn't work on safari nor firefox, very strange
