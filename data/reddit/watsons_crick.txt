I'm sticking to my claim of $1,000-$2,000.  Why?  Because I have been told by EVERYONE on Reddit and anyone that claims to know about bitcoin, that "it will crash".  When it hit $40, I was told it will crash.  $60, same story.  At $200 I was guaranteed it would crash.  
I am 99% positive everyone that believes it will crash didn't invest in it and just doesn't believe anything online is feasible.  For example, when I bought 500 shares of Facebook for $18 a share I was told I was an idiot.  A co-worker and prior investor told me that Facebook was so dead that I was a sucker and should have just set my money on fire. It is blatantly obvious investors are getting old and behind all things tech by about 7 years.  
I'm not going to claim I will be correct, but given the track record of every online investor claiming to know and being incredibly wrong, I am going to just go the opposite direction on whatever they say involving tech and online commerce.  I think the older guys fear online anything because they don't understand it and get angry when they are proven wrong.
I should note that I was also told by EVERYONE that Amazon was going to be a flop and that there was absolutely no chance of online commerce ever making a dent in brick and mortar.  As for Netflix, this I had been told was going to fail, then when it started doing well, I was guaranteed once again it was going under and blockbuster would come back.  This was during their brief split and contract negotiations for content, around 2010-2011.  All I can say is that many people are fucking idiots.
Will bitcoin rise and dip down, yes.  However, will it crash...no.  unless government destroys it or a massive hole in security is found.

How does someone like myself (not saying my comments are bitcoin tip worthy) even receive a tip?  I have a blockchain wallet and have no clue how to use it (I know I suck). Am I just suppose to  post my address from the "receive money" section?
