Now, I just tell a select few. However, i concur. I only wish you the best. Why? Because just like you I too am a believer. But, if I was at your club at the time. I would have walked out with you and made our own. Private pm me if you want. I sense this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. If not I wish for it to to hold. For you, however what’s 10 k if it’s going to 1million &lt;...cheers my fellow hodler cheers .��
