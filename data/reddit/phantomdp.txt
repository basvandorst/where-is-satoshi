You set the fees yourself and then miners generally just process transactions with the highest fees first.

It's the only thing we, as users, can do to help though.

Miners get the fees

Where do I sign up?
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:27:24
I disagree, it depends what you do with the phone. Samourai wallet is probably only second to ledger and trezor in terms of security, and they are leaders in terms of privacy.

Agreed. Efficiency should ALWAYS come first.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:05:32
Always plan ahead!

Pull up a bitcoin log graph and you'll see it's pretty much a straight line! 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:10:17
You have a point there

Bought some BTC using their express buy thing 2 days ago and I'm still waiting for them to credit my account :l
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:07:29
Ok you can't be disrespecting the DOGE like that 
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:28:22
Oh hey! It's my wallet!
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:40:35
You'll need to look past the candlesticks and focus on the MAs and then you'll see it
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:30:50
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:21:54
It's sad that some people do :l

@_date: 2017-11-28 01:11:03
Yeah, he describes it as a business too..
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:30:02
We need to start pricing BTC in bread. BTC to 12000 fresh wholegrain loaves by 2020!

Possible secure enclave built into the hardware, we'll find out next month
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:38:19
It was an airdrop :P 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:19:07
Hodl = hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:38:46
GL OP! Let us know how it goes! 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:07:30
And that's r/btc's goal. To rope in all the newbies 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:25:03
Wrong way around. A satoshi is 0.00000001 btc. Millibit is for a million bits/satoshis
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:43:58
Coinbase aren't moving to S2X they're just adding support right? As well as splitting your coins. Same as it's doing with bcash. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:38:12
Skyrim x BTC nice
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:37:04
Idiot haha
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:04:29
People need to stop talking about "BCC". It's just pumping up bitconnect coin 
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:15:39
Another 60% drop and we *should* be done
