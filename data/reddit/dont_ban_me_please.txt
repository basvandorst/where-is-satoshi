you downvoted? what are you a child?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:14:38
How does it compare to stock market caps though?
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:36:22
Yeah, sort of. We're in for a long boring lull of very little movement.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:38:53
Is this a way for wall street to make money off bitcoin without actually buying bitcoin and without actually putting money into the bitcoin market? That's what it feels like anyways.

this comment didn't age well

I did and will put a lot of extra income into btc. I'd never go into dept to buy some. That's nutty.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:45:14
I mean, you are as much of an expert as that guy is. So.. sure. Someone make this comment a headline.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:44:45
I think it's like private transaction verification? Like "segregated witness" as in your witness is not part of the chain, it's separated? 
I really have no clue, just guessing based on the name mostly

watching these reverse walls fall is kind of entertaining. $13300 had a buy wall of 124BTC and it just went down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:43:11
I have one that is taking several days too. WTF bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:43:25
It's insane. I see why BCH exists now. Probably going to use BCH or Litecoin or Ethereum now to transfer my "wealth" from place to place.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:28:21
Won't happen unless there is a security flaw found in BTC .. or maybe Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:59


we can't talk in dollars like that. have to talk in percents. it's gone up 20-25% in 24 hours
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:04:52
Storing your money in coinbase is probably fine. If coinbase gets hacked, the bitcoin is done for.
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:52:12
Yeah, we're really investing in the security of BTC. If a bug/flaw is ever found, everyones money is out the window.
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:26:22
Silly you for trusting the Wall Street Journal.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:53:47
Yeah I'd empty my bank account into bitcoin at $1.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:40:33


Haha. LOL. Nah. $800 at best is the highest it will go in 7 years. And thats only with the hope that a better technology does not come along and replace BTC and also hoping that a bug/flaw in Bitcoin is not founf.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:57:18


Yeah, I could see that. Fluctuating between 200-400 seems reasonable.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:37:45
I mean .. I think you are right .. but .. where the fuck do you come up with that data? You pull those numbers from your ass?
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:36:12
Yeah, this is just manipulating statistics to make them say what you want them to say. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:20:31
yeah. we in a little bit of a bubble. not bad but still, this growth is probably not sustainable.
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:09:09
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:10:47
I think $250/coin is an excellent price an we should all be happy about it.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:25:28
Everybody should watch John Oliver tear Alex Jones a new asshole
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:23:33
Well .. it gave me a chance to sell off my BCH at a decent price. So I'm happy about the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:08:15
I mean, I gave it a long while to see which would win. I think BTC resolved its slow/expensive transaction issues that was the real worry. I think it's fine. I sold my BCH now. I don't think it will ever overtake BTC at all.
.. I still might buy back BCH if the price goes low enough that I find good value.
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:40:01
yeah the whole lightning thing saved the day. that basically killed bitcoin cash by solving the problem it was trying to solve.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:28:23
yeah this is just the nuttiest day. these jumps in value are unreal
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:20:14
Meh, I'm sure he made some money. He can always buy more back now and sell at a probably higher price in a year.
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:42:48
Yeah. Are there protections to prevent this from ever happening? I don't know anything about developers of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-29 02:21:57
ok mr bitcoin salesman, whatever you say.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:34:00
seems so.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:36:09
I just like bitcoin because I can send them online without having to pay Visa 2.9%. That's all.
