The same applies to banking and credit cards. (although at least with banking they'll refund your money)

**Important Note: If you didn't run the Java applet, and you're up to date with Java updates, you're most likely fine.** This is one of the many reasons **you should disable Java in your browser completely.** If you accidentally run the applet without thinking, you've likely lost all of your passwords and your Bitcoin wallet to the attacker.
To disable Java in chrome, you need to go to **chrome://plugins** and untick "Java(TM)". In firefox, you can go to **Tools&gt;Add-ons** and then it's under Plugins (IE is similar).
PLEASE Remember to encrypt your wallet, and run up to date anti-virus software. I personally nearly ran the Java applet when I was trying to close the "Do you want to allow Java" bar on chrome, luckily the secondary pop-up allowed me to cancel my action and close the tab.
For security researchers, I decompiled the Java applet and posted the source here: 
EDIT: For any security researchers interested, this uses some shady service called securejar, I've looked through the applet source, it seems to download the following file (**DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING**): ge.tt / api/1 /files /2ztI1uE1 /0 /blob?download (spaces added to avoid people copying and running this by mistake), runs whatever it downloads, and then sends back information to epickit DOT net which seems to be in the form of install tracking, it sends your OS, your username, and the username **fox33** which I'm guessing is the username of the guy spreading this malware.
I deobfuscated the tracking URL for anyone interested
    epickit DOT net/qsxnonlvrc DOT php?username=fox33&amp;evyaipgncs=windows&amp;piyhnvzbpw=YOURUSERNAME&amp;tlbkqdpvxm=Traditional

It infects you via a Java applet. If you don't run the Java applet you're fine.

I have already submitted a malware report. They previously had it blocked, but I'm guessing they've started changing the page depending on if the requests are coming from Google, so their automated system unblocked it.

BitListen is the original version before it was sold by the owner. BitListen is fully open source and doesn't contain malware.

Please be aware you need to do this with a text editor like Notepad ran as ADMIN. Otherwise you will get **Permission Denied**

It infects you using an unsandboxed Java applet. If you didn't give the Java applet permission to run, you're fine.
From what it looks like, it downloads an EXE specifically, so it shouldn't have infected your Mac. It seems to be in the database of most AV's now, so if you're concerned you can run some Mac security software and it should destroy any remnants.

As others have said, it's difficult to convince them, a very small part of their users will want to be paid in BTC, and a very small amount will pay in Bitcoin for their donation (Though I'd personally love to donate to many of these projects with bitcoin.)
At the LEAST, they could accept donations to projects through something like Coinbase or BitPay, then they have the money in their bank which they can pay the project with Paypal.
It would be great if they could pay out in Bitcoin, but if you look at projects like the Ubuntu Edge which has made MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, projects of that scale could easily tip the Bitcoin market if they had to pay out that amount in Bitcoin.

It's not just because they're cheap. They're DRM-free too! That's the most important reason. Hooray for no evil restrictive DRM!

Around 400 to make it to the front page, or 1800 for the TOP of the front page.

Actually if you install the browser plugin, such as their chrome app, the javascript is never modified without you updating the app. This guarantees that they aren't going to screw you over with malicious JS one day.

Perfect way to encourage people to talk about Bitcoin, outside of Just gotta make sure it doesn't get abused. Maybe 1 tip per user, per hour or something?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:51:19
I wouldn't doubt that :)
