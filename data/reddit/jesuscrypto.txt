User experience and benefits for the user are 2 different things. Also to open and close a channel i need to pay 2 onchain transactions so to your logic $60.

what exchange are you using to buy bitcoin?
If you are based in the USA circle.com might be the solution for you, in fact they display everything as dollars.

That would be a good idea if I didn't want to sell anything to my customers. My goal is to use the incentive of the bitcoin rain to get more customers sign up.

Maybe there is a way to finish processing transactions before we start accepting a new one. I am not saying it is the right thing to do, I am saying that if we apply queuing theory, smaller batch sizes mean shorter cycle time and if the cycle time is shortened the average lead time is shortened too, hence we are able to process more transactions

Another question for you.
Imagine that this app will go to many people that don't know what a bitcoin is and most likely don't have a bitcoin wallet. How would you resolve that problem?
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:35:32
Not necessarily, think about batch size but also think about "finish something before starting something else"
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:30:32
First of all, thanks for your feedback. 


For example if you have more frequent blocks you finish processing transactions earlier and reduce the utilization of a block (imagining same size). This is the first example that comes to mind, but I speculate we might be able to apply this same concept of queuing theory (shorter queues higher flow) in different ways that I can't see at the moment.

Hi Rodrigo, thanks for your help and congratulations on building a very exciting system! 1000 bits @_date: 2015-06-02 13:24:25
I appreciate what you are saying but it is not as appealing as going to a location and waiting for a bitcoin rain. My customers will get confused if I gave them encrypted paper wallets, they will have instead a good time if I send them to a location and they get free bitcoin

I don't know what sources you have that say that Ireland is used for " Call centers, small assembly" but they are wrong. Among other places I worked for 2 major US companies in the last 20 years developing software. Having call centers and small assembly would not be wise in Ireland due to the cost of labor.
@_date: 2014-05-16 06:04:22

anon, thanks for your suggestion.
It is a great idea because it shows how easy it is to donate bitcoin, on the other hand I fear that many people will not want to install an application on their phone, what do you think?
Also, I would be able to spare $100, not sure about $500 :-(
@_date: 2014-04-10 07:30:44
It can't be said about the north, but the republic is the technology hub for Europe. Ireland is among the largest exporters of software and technology in the world and in 2007 it even surpassed the US to be the largest exporter of software in the world. That's quite different from being far behind when it comes to adopting new technologies.

Yes I do, wondering if anybody got this lately
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:01:43
Hi, first of all, thanks but I will help you for free if i can.
The fact that the transaction is not confirmed does not mean that you are being scammed, it means that it has not been added to a block as yet. This can happen because there are a lot of other transactions with a fee bigger than yours queuing, so don't worry too much, your bitcoin will arrive to destination.
You ask: "It also looks like my primary address on CoinBase has changed. Will that effect anything?"
I don't use coinbase but many wallets generate a one time only address for receiving coins, so if you created another receiving address and it is different it will not be a problem.
Take it easy and bitcoin on

Something extremely similar happened in Ireland in 2008. They were caught straight away and soon after all Irish banks went under and became state owned.
In the Irish case, 3 of the perpetrators went to jail

I would like to have more detail on this statement, can anybody help?
In relation to not having SegWit:


@_date: 2016-12-20 14:31:29
Technically yes. So why does the blog post says no?
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:32:32
@_date: 2016-12-20 12:58:15
So if we fix tx malleability without SegWit, the absence of SegWit will not make a "poorer lightning network" as stated in the post, am I right?

If each store does 2 transactions on chain per day, there won't be space for anybody else 260,000/24/60/60= ~3 *2 = 6 transaction per second that is just one less than what a 1k block can cater for, good luck with that...

Excellent idea. Using online reputation at the base of users credit score is what I believe will be the direction of lending platforms of the future. 
A couple of suggestions, I am pretty sure you have already thought about it, but just in case... 
* Make sure that in the approval calculation you take into account previous outstanding loans from the same user
* Make sure you take into account loans requested by users that failed to repay within terms
@_date: 2015-04-05 09:04:17

Since when have customers started to request "elegant solutions"? I'd think they want solutions that are delivered fast and work well for them.
