Bitcoin you haven't sold isn't profit. You can hold as much as you want. 
Just don't classify the BTC as profits, it's an asset, it's not a profit until it's converted into USD under this wording.
You should be fine with this because no taxes are paid until you convert to fiat.

Why the would they want to keep btc? For an organization like wikipedia it doesn't make any sense. They take money in, use it to pay their costs. They're looking at BTC to take donations not as an investment.

@_date: 2014-09-17 14:38:18


Because they don't want anyone to track the money they are spending. That's why it's called money laundering. If someone were selling a card for under face value I'd be suspicious that it was invalid or stolen.

well, but making the fake wallet is a kind of counterfeiting, like making rip off handbags, but yes technically it's a kind of bait and switch or fraud. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:06:49
It's not a scheme though, to call it a scheme means that someone is trying to get something out of it. No one directs the bitcoin network. There is no purpose to it other than confirming transactions have occured. That's the whole point, peer-to-peer distributed with a value agreed to by the market means it can't be a pyramid scheme by definition. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:01:15
The counter example, just to be fair, is that the Democratic and Republican parties are funded by donations and really shouldn't be, so there is that. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:34:07
It would add like 3 seconds, tops. You're already scanning the money under this scheme so now you scan the wallet too. I mean, it's pretty fast to feed bills into a vending machine right now, just as fast as handing it to a cashier it would seem to me.
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:04:08
Paper wallets seem like a bad idea to me, I mean all someone has to do is wash their pants and they've lost everything on that wallet. Money has us beat on that front.
I'm much more comfortable encrypting my wallet and storing it online than I am relying on a single copy of a piece of paper. I mean, I've never understood why all the paper wallets only make 1 copy of each, they should print 2 or 3 copies of a paper wallet, not just one. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:22:05
Actually, that's exactly what it means and that's why you're probably going to lose. Am I wrong? What do your polling numbers say? 
I'd love to see a third party, like the Greens, elected en-mass but all that would do is make them the 2nd party in a 2 party system which is already well gerrymandered in the favor of the other party. So, it would replace a strong opposition with a weak opposition which is a recipe for dictatorship when next opinion sways away from that 3rd party. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:41:48
yeah, they'll eventually make an exception to this. BTC will be traded under that name. It's the standards that will adapt to bitcoin, not the other way around. As is wont to happen with disruptive technologies.

Yes, I can. I know individuals who are able to accept payment via CC, I can and have accepted payment for BTC with a CC using Square.

A much better way of soliciting btc donations would be to simply put your public address in the footer of the page. Then when someone sees any other advertising soliciting donations which compels them to donate they don't have to look far for the address. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:31:25
XBC would even be better than XBT... but they could always compromise and go to a 4th characters and call it XBTC. We'd probably accept that.

So, I've seen a counterfit bitcoin scam before. They printed up physical wallets with a public key for a known address with 1 BTC but with nonsense for the private key. 
They then sold the wallets to their victims, many of whom would even go so far as to check the outer address but wait to transfer the coins to a secure wallet until the con artist was too late. 
So, that's a kind of BTC counterfeiting.
Note, that if you're a quick talker and your mark is a BTC newb this kind of scam can be pretty easy to pull off. You tell the rube that they have the only copy of the private key but to take it somewhere where there are no cameras to be safe before importing it. This gives you 2 minutes you need to make your escape with the cash.

bitcoin doesn't care about profits, it's just the protocol. You could say the same thing about gold as you just said about bitcoin. 


You're also forgetting mining, people who gained their coins through mining only require a value greater than energy cost to mine in order to make a profit with bitcoin.

If you do it in an organized fashion it's conspiracy to commit money laundering. You call it a refund but that is a lie. That's fraud. Equal value is meaning less, since btc is not money, by law... yet..., you can't treat it like money.

The USPS is one of the best postal systems in the world. It delivers &gt;99.9% of all mail on time and undamaged. It's literally more reliable than UPS, FedEx, and DHL when it comes to deliveries to US addresses. How reliable? All 3 of the other services use the USPS for last mile delivery in some places while the USPS doesn't ever need help from any of them, ever. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:06:48
Because you are concealing the reasons for (and nature of) your transaction and you're using money, the USD. The fact that BTC is involved is irrelevant.

You do have the right to spend it, no one's saying you don't. What you can't do is conceal the fact that you are spending money or that you are receiving money. 
I believe the wording in the statute is to conceal the source of income, which is what the person selling the BTC would be doing. He would be showing it as a refund when it was a sale. In any case you are not paying taxes because no one pays taxes on a refund. That's money laundering and tax evasion.

Actually it can be. You can transfer coins to a specific wallet (still managed by Coinbase) with block chain confirmation. This is often used to prove to other people who are not on Coinbase that you do have access to sufficient funds to perform a transaction.

No one brainwashed me you ass. And unlike you, apparently, I don't have to pay for sex. 
Hiding money and making people ashamed of how they spend their money is part of how the wealthy control the poor. Making salaries taboo to talk about helps the bosses discriminate and takes power away from the workers. 
All salaries and the taxes paid on them should be made public and most other transactions are already public. They can be observed by anyone nearby and the other party can tell anyone what I bought with no repercussions. When a business sells something there is no reason to keep that secret, it's completely pointless. They have to report it to the government anyways. 
Most transactions are already public, so I don't see the point of being paranoid about it. 
Since the government already gets to know nearly every transaction it's not fair that they are the only ones to know.
@_date: 2019-10-13 04:49:13

The fact is they are handled. There are many international agreements in place and they vary from country to country.

I know how bitcoin mining works... You should really read the article we're talking about at some point: 




This natural gas is not being used to generate electricity. Except when it's being used to temporarily power these bitcoin mining operations instead of being burned off for nothing.
Using this excess gas to power bitcoin mining has absolutely no effect on the electric system. None. No electricity is being generated for the grid by this gas. And no bitcoin is being mined by these installations when there is no excess gas available. 
So, maybe read the article in the first place instead of making an fool of yourself by lecturing someone in the comments.

You guys seem to have a hard time understanding what's going to happen here. The gas is going to be burned no matter what, bitcoin mining or not. So, mining bitcoin with it isn't going to displace any other fossil fuel use anywhere else, it would be in addition to all the other mining going on. 
Using the gas to mine bitcoin doesn't lessen the amount of gas burned anyway. Thus the effect on the environment is unchanged, mining or not.

You can always just turn tor off if you want. It's not recommended but I think you're misunderstanding what TAILS is and how TOR works. TAILS it's not a place where you store your GF's nudes, it's a blank clean OS you boot to that doesn't keep your files.  That's the A in the acronym, for Amnesiac. And TAILS is not something the NSA can easily hack. That's the point.
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:31:00


See the green onion button at the top? You can just click that and turn tor off. Just like every other installation of Tor. They're not using some custom Tor software, it's just the stock off the shelf thing. 
And as I said, I've used TAILS before to run bitcoin software. It will run anything that you can get from the Debian repo.

Amnesiac Slavery? Did you mangle a word in that sentence, I'm not sure what you mean. Possibly Antebellum was auto-corrected? 
The point is you can't ignore history of the term. Ignoring history doesn't mean it didn't happen. 
When NIN mentions slavery they are obviously referencing American slavery and the modern rat race and are juxtaposing the two. That's the whole point. When libertarians are referencing slavery they're doing the same thing but when NIN does it's conscious and intentional and meaningful, when libertarians do it they're minimizing it.

That's simply not true at all. You must be doing something significantly wrong, do you own a house worth like 500k?. Perhaps that's it? 
The average tax burden for people making 50k - 75k is about 21%, 10% state and 11% federal. So if you're paying 50% then you're really doing something wrong. It's as simple as that. The average american pays 13.5% of their income over all taxes. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:11:25
Youre probably doing something wrong then. But in the golden days of the us the marginal tax rate on the wealthy was 95% 
If your tax rate is even close to 50% then you have more than enough to live like a king. That's why we have a progressive tax system and why stating the absolute % as though it were relevant is just another form of lying with statistics. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:53:55


No, I'm not, I'm telling you what the actual tax burden is for the average american. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:16:05


And I'm telling you you're wrong. It obviously has more than 0 to do with historical slavery in the US because the term is being used by Americans to talk about American politics in an environment filled with racial inequality. It only has nothing to do with slavery if you are totally and completely ignorant of history and context. 
You seem to be one of the people who wants to be willfully ignorant of this even having been told. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:43:05
I believe I explained this already but equating taxes to slavery minimizes slavery. No, having to pay taxes does not make you a slave, that very premise is laughable.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:06:01
I'm simply using the term correctly. Not every human is born into a position where they must work to be provided for. Some are born into wealth and privilege. Yes, babies must be taken care of but that's a straw man argument. It was recently reported that 60% of the US's working population would not be able to cope with one month with no income. That's wage slavery. That's immediate and total dependence on a wage or salary. The bosses have done everything in their power to prevent a huge chunk of the population from being paid a living wage. We are not a free people anymore. We are at the mercy of our employers.

@_date: 2017-05-28 18:48:40
ok, but your tax burden, that is the amount of your income which goes away as taxes, is still only about 21% if you're an average american with 50k to 75k income... It's nowhere near half and it's less than many, many other western industrialized countries.

You are incorrect. 
Perhaps you are forgetting to add back the benefits you get from the government like money for school. Remember this is on average and not about your particular situation, in which you may be paying higher than average taxes because you are a unique individual and there is always some variance when talking about averages.
In any case, you're now at 30% and still nowhere near the claimed 50% we were originally talking about. The most generous estimate we have is 41% still and we know that's ludicrously high. 
People often feel like they pay more taxes than they do, and part of that is because of how we tack them on at the end in the US, but it's about how it feels not what the actual percentages are. It's also annoying that there are stealth taxes for things like building permits, license plates, and fishing licenses. It can really feel like the government is always in your pockets but that's because that's how we do it here, not because they're taking too much money.

Given that BTC is internet based and the internet is designed to survive just that kind of "global crisis" you envision it seems unlikely that it could be destroyed. The only real threat to BTC is a technological flaw that splits the block chain or a computing breakthrough that makes the math too easy. 
I'm curious though, can you give an example of a global crisis which happened in the past which might disrupt the modern globe enough? The only true global crises that I've ever heard of happening have been biological in nature, Spanish Flu and the like. Something like that wouldn't have much of an effect on BTC save orphaning some coins as the people who control the private keys die without passing on the info/coins.

That being said, there is a mechanism in place to combat the obvious consequences. Extreme deflation would render most currencies highly impractical: if a single Canadian dollar could suddenly buy the holder a car, how would one go about buying bread or candy? Even pennies would fetch more than a person could carry. **Bitcoin, however, offers a simple and stylish solution: infinite divisibility. Bitcoins can be divided up and trade into as small of pieces as one wants, so no matter how valuable Bitcoins become, one can trade them in practical quantities.**

The transaction priority function you describe is native to the QT client implementation, not to the bitcoin protocol itself. Some miners still include transactions without fees. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:50:29
No, it couldn't because it wouldn't be a function. Give an example that proves me wrong, I'd be happy to see it.

but not nearly the whole world, even at it's worst hitting SE Asia it would hit about a third of the world's population. The rest of the miners would keep confirming transactions and discovering blocks.

Given that they've had problems with such things before how is this an unreasonable suspicion?

I can tell you now it's going to be abysmal @ $40. You need to think more like $9.99, it's just ubuntu with a single custom script. It's like you're charging $40 for a single app and we usually pay less than $5 for even the best apps.
Just saying, your costs for those CDs are a couple bucks at most, shipping included so charging so much just looks bad.

If something is wrong or not cited then try 
    {{fact}}
Otherwise you must realize that wikipedia just links to things other people have said. Find something that says something positive about bitcoin and cite that. 
Folks need to stop asking wikipedia to be something it's not.

It's a consequence of equating money with political speech. 
In a democracy everyone's voice is supposed to be equal, and they are in the ballot box but outside that we're social animals and we listen to whoever can speak the loudest and under capitalism that means whoever can buy the biggest microphone. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:02:37
Alternately the Justice Department could investigate political corruption, as their mandate entails. The sad fact is they don't even investigate when we can see that politicians are being swayed by their political donors by their public donor lists and voting record.

It's not like they can keep the coins, that'd be fraud. I know, I know the guy filled it out and did it all himself but it's still probably not what they agreed to, it's like if someone gives you a $100 bill but was supposed to give you a $20. You can't just keep it you have to give them change back. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:24:47
You do understand that's only the reference implementation and it's not used by everyone though, right?

They charge a monthly maintenance fee, which makes them unacceptable as a credit union in my opinion. It's super greedy to charge me to lend them my money, it's like a negative interest rate.

I find btc to be exactly the same in volatility over the 30 seconds it takes me to make a purchase as GBP or EUD. Sure, you might have to check any of these exchange rates but I don't see how btc is any different than other currencies. 
As someone who actually used BTC to make purchases I can say that the volatility is pretty much a non-issue on the individual purchase scale. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:20:44
This is exactly why I have a hard time selling bitcoin to people. I ask how much they want and they say $20 worth. Ok, well you don't even know how much btc you want, I can do the math... 
At which point they back out because they really don't understand what bitcoin is or how it works because they just want $20 worth to buy a specific thing. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:40:38
Ok, you're a Conspiritard. Happy? ;p
They have to leave this kind of thing to a computer program, it's not just an issue of volume but of fairness. People have a hard time being objective and will do stupid things unconsciously, like, for example, penalizing a man with, what they percieve to be, a mixed gender name like Jordan, Jane, or Kim.

My web wallet's password and info are stored in my LastPass  key ring which is linked to my gmail account, for which I have designated my sister as my trusted contact. 
If something happens to me she gets access 60 or 90 days after the last activity, something like that, and from there she should be able to get access to all my accounts. 
For my paper wallets, she'll just find them in among my papers. I've talked with her about BTC so she knows they'll have value, even if she doesn't know what to do with them someone will be able to help her or she'll be able to figure it out.

.2 btc means .2 btc, if you care about the price in a different currency that's your problem not the seller's problem. When you make a purchase in euros do you constantly check the exchange rate to dollars and pounds?

There's nothing wrong with web wallets. They have different risks than other wallets but are convenient. Until BTC is as easy to use as paypal it'll never get enough traction. That's why web based wallets are good.

Provably false and laughable. If someone dies they don't pay any more taxes. To be a capitalist about it they don't contribute to GDP. They don't vote or influence people in any way. If they're alive they do, and thus the effect on society is different.
