Sorry dude you missed the good product manager part - their job is to conduct user research, user testing and gather consistent feedback - they ensure the product is constantly addressing the problems Of the end user.

Wow this table is new to me! Good work
Are you proposing at all that HODLERS in 2021 somehow band together and chip in for the mission to the moon? As this would be genius. [This article]( suggests that going to the Moon would cost 3.3million in todays inflationary dollars. If you could somehow calculate the average amount of coins held by BTC investors and their net worth in 2026 (the year this article says we can go) and then multiply by the amount of investors actually willing to take the journey then we could find out the cost involved!
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:51:53

How does (1) happen?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:23:14
What a interesting situation you're in. This is what I would do in precise order.
1 - talk with a lawyer about options/security
2 - talk with a financial adviser about how to manage a btc cash out
3 - cash out 100 btc at the best rate possible (next all time high?). Hold the other 100btc for another 10years
4 - put the cashed out btc into index funds. Some with more risk could get you 10-15% returns per year
5 - get a mortgage on a house. Pay off mortgage monthly with interest from funds
6 - in 5-10 yrs re-evaluate where you are life with money and family, see how bicoin is doing then and possibly take a look at selling off another half (50btc)
