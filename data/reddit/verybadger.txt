Not only that, but you also get paid in bitcoins for wearing it.

Testimonials? Do you mean users? No, users are real. You can actually click on each one and see that there's usually facebook or twitter links in many of those profiles. Not fake. Investigate.
The frontpage image with t-shirts is obviously just an example.

It's not us who'll be paying you, but advertisers. But yeah, you got the rest right. You get a t-shirt and you get to be paid for wearing it.

Coke is just an example. It is assumed that you will be wearing a t-shirt of a company that creates an ad-campaign on the site. That company will be paying you. It won't necessarily be a big business.

We'll figure out a more flexible option here, but you can set it to 0 at this point and then either accept or decline an invitation to participate for a certain daily rate.

I think you probably have mistaken it for the US.

Stupid mistake on our side, thanks for pointing it out. Fixed it.

Yes, before accepting the invitation, each participant is able to review the campaign details and know for sure what is it that's he's advertising and on what terms.

Hi, yeah, we're negotiating currently. It might take a while.

Hi, founder here. We're currently working on the technical side, which is non-trivial (although the site itself may seem like it), namely we want to make it all work with multisig transactions, so the site doesn't keep anyone's coins. We're also talking to advertisers and making sure the matching process works smoothly. It all may take some time, so please don't expect immediate results.
In the meantime, if you have any feedback or questions, feel free to post it here or email us.
Edit: We would also be very thankful if you spread the word about us anywhere on twitter, facebook or whatever you use to waste your time. But! But! Only if you like the idea.

Thanks. Fixed it, you can try again now.
