This is the most accurate description I've ever read. Like even if I lost tens of thousands, I've still made 100s of thousands out of just thousands. It would be stupid to pull out and risk missing the next big jump and making mad money.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:14:22
Oh I do, I always tell them the golden rule, never invest more than your willing to lose, or any amount that will put you in financial risk. I warn them that the worst thing they could do is take out their investment, so they never want to put themselves in the situation where they have to take out their coin and missout on a boom. I also implement this with examples from friends who have pulled out coin in fear of a dip just to missout on a jump and huge gains. My boss learned this the hard way, bought a whole coin for 2.5k, freaked when it dipped to 1.5k and pulled out when it got back up to 2.5k, missing out on huge profits when it jumped to 5k the same weak. He went back in but had to settle with half a coin. Easy to say, he never pulls out now.

Go back to California 2005, a bottle of water might as well have cost 10k. bastards didn't even let people wash their cars back then, in fact it came with a 10 thousand dollar fine. So you can say the water it took to wash your car cost you 10k if you got caught.

troll/analyst, they had to have some analyst knowledge to predict the prices right so far.

Maybe he's the time traveler that predicted the prices rightly since 2013? The only thing their off on is the time traveler said 1 million by 2021, so he's ahead of schedule by a year with his predictions

Gotta spell it right man. If you don't spell it as hodl then we won't know what your trying to say. And of course, haven't sold a dime since I started, even if I use it as a currency to buy things I quickly buy back whatever amount went out for the purchase to keep my hodlings steady and growing.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:26:34
Can confirm too. The only fucking reason I invested is because I want to be done working by the time I'm in my mid 40's; so 20 more years for me! 100k grown so far and still collecting more with every check!! Common bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:57:00

@_date: 2018-05-23 16:52:28

Do you even know poker? You said the opposite of what I said with that analogy. Look dude, I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to buy how I buy and do as I please. Go invest your own way and see how it works out. Well compare progress in 20 years and see who played their cards better, you; the guy trying to tell everyone it's dead and going no where, or me; the guy who buys and sells millions of dollars in the stock market every day for a living using the same buying strategies for crypto. 
And the trend is not in price, the trend is in the awareness bitcoin get's every-time it breaks new barriers, the eyes it get towards it, and the wallets behind those eyes. First will come the institutional money we're seeing this year, mathematically putting enough behind bitcoin to go past 100k, then will come the retirement financial sector that will be given an option to enter, and once a small percentage of the boomers, a decent almost 50 percent chunk of millennia's, 90% chunk of generation Z'ers get the opportunity to put their 401k behind it, then that will be the cash flow to push BTC past a million a coin. After this it will be a free fall of cash flow and government acceptance of the currency that will push it into the millions a coin. But you'll never see this path today, as you don't pay attention to any of these factors or the money behind them, neither do you believe it will happen. So go on with your day, pretend what you heard is impossible, tell yourself it's bullshit speculation if it makes you feel better. Because what I'm getting from you, is that no matter what you hear or what you see, you won't believe it till it happens, like the rest of the market watchers out there who don't look ahead of the market to react, but instead stare right at it like a kid in a video game pressed up right against a wall unable to see the full picture, allowing the even basically trained gamers to shoot him right in back of the head and take all his loot without any resistance thanks to the guy not knowing how to look around and see more.

I have over 150k in total value of coins, I'm just not willing to move them all into btc as they have the potential to outgrow the value they would have if I had the whole thing in btc. Those guys can buy there btc, well have a fun game to see who's bets grow bigger. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:44:46
If it moons now, then you won't be able to buy btc at sub 10k price levels anymore. This is a good thing, it's like buying a million dollars for 2021 for 6k a pop. So stop fretting and collect cheap while you have the chance. Cause the next time it runs up, it won't be dipping back down past 10 or 20k.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:36:03
Nah, I read what is out there, am an analyst by profession so after studying the charts and seeing the trend I see the potential. Granted it still might die, but fat chance at this point. To many eyes on it and only more to come as new barriers are broken. Anyone with the balls enough to hold even 2 years will realize this, because even though they'll lose 70 to 80% of there value at times, they'll realize they're still up 1000% from where they got in 2 years ago, or 10,000% if they got in 5 years ago. The point is there is a pattern, and those who recognize the pattern don't fear the drops, instead they expect them, wait for them, and thats when they buy. Buying high is a fools errand. Buying during the 50 to 80% crashes is when they pros buy. It's the same story as the stock markets but with much faster growth, it's how all my professors bought, how all the billionaires bought. Don't go with the herd, they will always lead you wrong. When they say buy, sell 10%, when they cry sell, use that 10% you sold to buy 5 times the coins you sold them for. My best professor turned 16k to 6 million during the stock market crash, my best friends have turned 600 into 6 million in the same time frame it took my professor to do that in the  stock market. Play in both games if you have the means, but if you don't; play here, and when you grow enough here to be able to play in both, then play in both.

Smart move. Damn so guess I didn't catch it late. Was under the impression coinbase had added it in January 2017 at the 1 dollar fiddy mark it was at the time. Guess I got it when they added it too then. I haven't sold any, but I have traded a few for other coins since I bought a stupid number of them.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:15:34
I can handle the volatility, It's just that someone has to make the sacrifice so the bitcoin gods can run the price away from them, and get their chuckle. Without a sacrifice like the one I made; then they will force us to sit through limbo for longer than we must.

It will get automated in time. Bet some asshole will read this thread, make it into an automated service app where you can set your own self tax, and then all you'll have to do is just pay with your bank automatically being drawn to replace the used btc along with your future you tax without giving me credit or a cut of the idea ��
But this is why it's called the early days of the internet for crypto, all the things we can do so easily today, coders or programmers were doing in the 90's already just through more complex steps like we have today. For mass adoption it has to be made to one step for mass adoption so things like this will begin to happen.

@_date: 2018-06-26 22:27:39
Yes, yes they did. I'm an analyst and have seen direct correlation to the major drops all happening the day these announcements had been made. Hate advertising all you want but the human psyche is simple, it sees something day in and day out and then they finally look it up after having it shoved in their face 1000 times. Think of a song you hated when you first heard it, then loved it after a couple listens. This is how your brain works, how mine works, how everyones works. Without the means to get it in front of them then we're relying on word of mouth to spread the word. And yes that may work, but way slower than a bot placing it in front of billions of faces driving their conscious to pay attention to it. The big players know this, which is why they get scared when advertising abilities get cut, that's why those actions trigger them to pull their cash out, only to have them move back in when they're comforted by knowing it can be distributed easily again.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:29:47
Holy fuck so you got it at a dollar fiddy? I was so fucking mad, My app updated late so I didn't even know they had added LTC till it was at 30 dollars. Still bought a shitload but gawd damn if I had a chance to get it at 1 dollar I'd be 30 times richer off that buy.

Thank you for spreading the narrative we've worked so hard to spread out there. Took a lot of word to get Steve to speak out, but when he did, it helped a shitload of our clients get on board, Steve got a pretty nice back end cut out of it too. The illusion of control is also on your side, we let you think this tech is under your control but at the end of the day who do you think has bought the most coins? Keep investing, keep hodling, but just know, the fattest wallets in the game are the wallstreet shmucks you detest so much. You may believe them to be dumb but they don't need to be smart, they just pay people like me to listen for when and how to move, and with our guidance and their financial ability, guys like me have the power to swing the market just like the stock market, but thanks to the massive swings with bitcoin, the profits are like nothing ever seen in the investing world.

Well most likely see a dip to 4k maybe even 3k, should last through 2019, and if were lucky well see an upswing either late this year or early 2019, then it will be a slow climb back up, that will trigger an institutional fomo rally when we get close to being back at 20k that will launch it up past 100k.The only reason it's not going back up right now is because all of my colleagues are waiting for the 3k 4k day till we start putting back the insane amounts of money we took out.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:02:13
I invest the Buffet way. Put it in and pretend you already lost it. If you already lost it in your mind then you won't mind when it's gone. Making it a much nicer surprise when it comes back 1000 times stronger.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:33:27
It's been sticking to the 2013 drop pattern, so of it keeps to that then were not out of the storm yet. It's a good thing though, use these drops to buy, little chunks here and there till we drop to the floor, then make your big moves and hodl for the eventual tsunami, because that's when wall street will be pulling there bazooka triggers too instead of just their peeshooters how they're doing atm.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:38:58
We know this, wallstreet knows this now too thanks to us. Why do you think wallstreet came in to grab most of the coins? Buckle up though because the next clients we have taking interest is governments. And those clients have the means to grab 3 times the coins our wallstreet clients do. So soon enough the biggest owners of this game will be the same people who already own you. It's a necessary step to convince them to adopt crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:46:05
Until they see that 21% 1000× their money. Then they'll be rushing in making the 21% richer than they ever dreamed. Until the next drop when where back down to 20k with everyone in despair from the 100k drop, but now with 42% waiting for a million, then down to 200k more disrepair, but with 84% waiting for the next jump to 10 million. Then comes adoption.

You are correct that china and Korea's creackdowns nocked us down to 15k, they're the reason we didn't blow past 20k. But facebook and googles announcement caused the spike down to 10k and 5k. China and Korea didn't help, but without Facebook and Google we would have never seen the other 2 massive drops that bleed us down to 5k.

That's actually how I do it. But given the time it takes to confirm the buy; then the buy I do is transacted with the bitcoin I have while knowing the replacement is on its way. So sort've a mix of both technically just because the btc I used to pay was my own since the replacement I prebought is still not in my wallet and in the process of being mined.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:07:50
I never said it was going to 100k this year, just that the institutional money will be the push to get it to 100k, my time frame is before the end of 2019 from the cash speed flowing in at the moment and it's rate of increase flow as more institutional investors get in. So far they just are getting their bridges so they can flow their money in, so less than 5% of institutional money is dipping their toes in the water ATM. The point is the bridges are being made and plenty of the institutional players are watching waiting to jump in(I know because I'm the guy advising a good amount of them on when and where to move). It won't save 2018 from the dip though, well probably see it go down to 4k maybe even 3k before there is an upswing. It's the number my clients are waiting for before they move. Only way I'd advise them to hop in at 6k is if it holds 6k to the end of the year or starts rocking back up towards 10k. But for now I'm advising them to wait before making big waves in the game, because the chart and pattern show the dip isn't over just yet. Still too many people panic selling for it to rise any significant amount; that translates to price jumps only leading to waves of FUD sales knocking it back down a bit more by triggering stop loss sales causing further dips. Until these panic sellers are gone; well not see significant growth. Usually takes them a year to 2 years to flush out and have them replaced with new buyers hodling for their day, as well as some smart new buyers waiting for the adoption to take place.
And to answer your question, if we are still under 6k by the end of 2021 after the next halving, then I'll agree with you that I was wrong and this is going no where.

Do you know anything about the market? That's always the game at the end of the day, you never pull everything out unless certain death is inevitable. Who do you think are the hodlers of most of the coins in existence? Combined my clients have more coins than satoshi alone. The fact that our pool hodl's so much is what allows us to dip it, rise it, and dip it again. All with co-ordinated moves timed with stories in the market. Who do you think are the ones controling what stories go to the top and which don't? Didn't you wonder who kept this post from rising to number 1 on this sub? We wan't it to dip to the 3k 4k range for a re-entry with 5 times the coins of what we sold them for further increasing our clients already fat stacks. The powerless hodl, the powerful hodl and move the market to their withdrawls and buys.

Exactly, all us analyst have been saying this since the 10k break. This is how bitcoin grows, a 1000 percent boom, followed by a 85% drop, then a slow crawl back to the top before the next big boom. If only they knew how much money our clients are waiting to inject once we get down to the 4k 3k range. One client alone is ready to put enough that will shoot it back to 20k, and we have over 50 clients of that size just waiting for us to tell them when.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:35:52
It wasn't just facebook, facebook nocked us down to to sub 15k levels with their announcement leading to a slow bleed down to 12k, google announcing it's ban is what knocked us down to sub 10k levels bleeding down to 5.8k. This should help stabilize the market, but I don't see it getting us back to 20k, well need google to announce it's reversal to put us back in the 2016 growth pace.

Because people are not taught to go against the grain. I got lucky and had some good educators. And to be honest,  my first investment was money I didn't need and was looking for anywhere to put it, and the growth bitcoin had from sub penny value to 20 dollars had caught the attention of any financial analyst in the industry worth a shit at the time. It was the biggest, &amp; fastest growth any-market had seen in the last 200 years. So I was already going to look at it anyway for study. But the thread and a nice bowl of indica made me pull the first trigger and put my play money in it. Since then I've been looking at it daily getting to see the trends and recognize them more. It's like putting a puzzle together from the edges and using them as references to put together the middle, everything just looks like random shit that doesn't fit together till you piece it together. But keep believing the herd if you wish to do that. Myself personally will keep studying the charts and market myself and betting on my experience instead of everyone else's baseless herd persuaded speculations of death and despair.  I'm sure those guys are right, it's why they're all rich right? Because they followed the market and bought high only to panic sell low. True professionals those herd guys.

Yeah, especially since now we must pay capital gains taxes on everything we liquidated. Shiet.

Don't worry. I just sold everything to buy back in cheaper; so if history serves right it should shoot back up forcing me to go back in for double the price of what I sold. This is how you turn 20 bitcoins into 10 boys! Watch and learn!

In 10 years if Buffet is still alive he'll make another statement about how he didn't understand it at the time like he's said about Apple and Amazon. Buffet's got a strong investor mindset, he just doesn't  have a strong investment selector one. Things have to prove themselves beyond a certain point for Buffet to see it with how bad his eyes figuratively and literally are.

It is panic selling if they're not looking past the 2 years, it also shows they just want to get out, and the big players rather have them hop off at 6k or 4k than 20k or more. And the big players that are buying right now are buying in a way to not trigger and upswing just yet. Like I say to my investors to not move till they see 4k or 3k, the rest of the people like me advising the big players to move in are doing the same. If we were to advise them to move in big now and have it dip to 4k it would only scare them from moving in bigger(also would decrease our performance and profit potential having them get in to early, decreasing our cut of the profits). Although if some asshole diverts from the plan and pushes it back over 15k then the rest of us would have to advise our people to move. But that's not the plan so for now expect it to dip to 4k. The day you see google make their reverse ban announcement, that's the day you should move on it big. Personally I'll be moving on it the day before they make their announcement thanks to a buddy of mine at the helm of the negotiations, he's doing his best to hodl them off till the end of the year; that's the only way well get it down to 4k, but if they jump the gun and announce it before that time frame then forget about the 4k dip, because google will have fucked up a whole 2 years of hard work to bring it down low enough for our clients to see a trillion dollar growth on their investments.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:28:09
unrealized gains. This is why you hodl for 5 years, after five years you'll be so far ahead that even if you through in 100k and lose 100k in value you'll still be ahead of what you have put in thanks to the millions that have grown.

We got till september, when you see it go under 5k, to the 4k mark start buying heavily, will dip to 3k for like 3 hours too if you pay attention enough to get it. After 2019 well never see a bitcoin under 10k again

Because they want to rub it in everyone else face that they *think* it's dead to make themselves feel better about missing out. It will only be a temporary happiness though; when it shoots back up they will again be depressed for not having any skin I'm the game

@_date: 2018-06-11 04:21:54
Just sell low so it can shoot back up allowing you to buy high. Its how us pros do it. I flushed 20 btc today to try and get it lower. If history served right I'll be buying 10 coins back after it shoots up running away from me. Been playing this game since 100 bitcoins ago, I swear sometimes it's like someone's fucking with me.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:16:03


@_date: 2018-06-26 23:09:54
Do you know how the market works? Put in money to fast and you move the price up before you can buy even 10% of the bitcoins for 10k much less 6k. This is what they tried to do in 2016 too before they shot it up to 20k. Also, the profit ranges were shooting for require a 4k price dip. It's why we worked with facebook and google advising them to block advertisements till we could work out a better crypto ad policy. Facebook jumped the fucking gun to soon on coming back though so I'm not as certain of the 4k dip as I was when we had them banning it, but there is a chance if google reframes from there announcement. Might not see the low 4k or 3k mark but hopefully well still see a high 4k dip even with this news.

Is that guy new here or something? I though this was common knowledge amongst redditors?
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:22:15
Because my dumbass will not regulate my purchases well and spend more btc than my check puts in lol. Plus, in an uncertain market like this it's best to through in chunks of your investment, that way you have capital to move in consistently every dip you see. If you throw it all in now and then if there appears a new discount tomorrow you won't have anything left to invest tomorrow when it dips.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:21:09
Actually, I can liquidate into 1.7 btc right now If I wished, just everytime the market shoots back up I'm almost up to 2 btc so I figure if I wait then I can liquidate a portion for a full btc without giving up all my shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:03:39
Oh it will go lower, probably won't see a recovery till mid 2019 or later. I expect it to hodl ratio so the same ratio from the last major drops would put bitcoin at 4k possibly 3k figure range. It's why I'm buying ETC right now waiting for the 3k or 4k drop. When it's in that range I'll focus on buying BTC again instead of going all in on ETC like I'm doing at the moment. This pattern will hodl, and everyone will hate it because of it. But it's the only way it can get as big as it's getting, can't have the big growth without the big drops.

Idk why people are downvoting this post. This guy has hit every point us analyst have been feeding to our wall street clients. We've known since the break of 10k that we were going down to 4k maybe even 3k. When we hit those magic numbers, that's when you'll see us directing our clients to make their big moves.

I guess you understand little about what makes the majority percieved price making them willing to pay that proce, and that is the number of dollars behind it decided by the number of bitcoins out there. Drive the cashflow in and the value grows, pull it out like we convinced all our investors to do and you trigger stop losses getting rid of all those get rich folk while making it cheaper for ourself and our clients to come in with 10 times the BBC we had when we sold. Analyst have a lot of sway in what the big players do, and we have a plan every year. To drop it, to grow it. Who do you think Facebook and Google consulted with before dropping crypto and considering a revival of their ad policies? Who do you think China and South Korea consulted with that told them the same with their laws on crypto? Analyst have always been the ones to trigger the market, after all it's on our advice and action that these companies use their billions of dollars. And with what we did last year, and where we brought it down to, well now we got the ears of almost all our clients ready to hop their feet in the floor instead of just 10% of our institutional clients. Companies like them would never have got in at 20k. It had to be brought down for their greed to get them to act, and the only way to do that was to get our other clients to trigger the stop losses by coercing them with other clients actions to fear the market. Just wait till you see how many have dipped their toes into the water already, all ready to jump in, as soon as we give them the signal. Though for now, we still have a target to get it down to 4k with a bit of more news soon to be seen that will trigger our clients to pull out what they've put in triggering some more stop losses. The stop loss fools just make this easier, without them we wouldn't be able to make it jump and drop so easily.   
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:47:31
Truth is, this is the last year in history we will be able to buy BTC at sub 10k price levels. It's why so many of my people saved up their last time miles to travel here. Get as much as you can now, because soon it will be out of reach of the laymen's man.
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:43:22
Actually. It follows the trend down this year shows that the others don't.  Would be better to show people we got apart a year before recovery.  But that's a year we can use to buy 
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:07:15
Does that mean I'll be able to hop back in for cheaper?!?!? Haven't looked at the chart out of fear
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:59:32

Clearly you don't study the market. I've been in this game for 8 plus years to and am a analyst who advises Wallstreet on buys and sells every day. Shit I'm even a part of the people helping wallstreet move in, advising them when, where and how. So keep believing what you believe, I'll keep studying the market and reporting my findings to my clients and when they should hop in.

Your welcome. Someone had to trigger the crypto gods into moving the chart up. Without someone missing out for their entertainment; they force us all to sit in limbo forever. I just hope the next time someone else can make the sacrifice and lose half their stash that's not me.

@_date: 2018-06-29 00:30:23
Well duh, who do you think is manipulating it in the first place? Just sit back and watch as we advice our clients when to move in and out. Don't worry, were not trying to kill it, just trying to attract more clients into the game. It's how stock works, see a great business, buy it till you run the price up quite a bit higher, sell all to trigger sell orders. Then buy back once we've convinced the market that there gold is worthless to buy it from them for pennies on the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:18:33
Wan't to know the saddest way someone get's into crypto? You read the time travel thread, compare the predictions to the chart, say OMG what if it's real? It got every prediction so far. What if it holds true? That's literally how I convinced myself to get in without any research into the tech or how it worked. That all came later. They more I learn, the more confident I get with how much I put in.
