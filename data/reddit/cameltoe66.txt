I don't believe Mnuchin can be that stupid but you never know, maybe he is. Facts seem to be an abstract concept for politicians these days, he's surely not fooling anyone though.

SilkRoad used Gox for hedging, it was also reported that the DEA snagged that wallet whilst SilkRoad was still operational, it was in DPRs journal found on his laptop

I have not been able to find a single company that is actually offering a plastic prepaid bitcoin debit card in my region. I used to have a Spectrocoin card until they discontinued it.

Bitcoin is king though and that will not change for quite some time if at all depending on its eventual use case. Its slow and sometimes expensive but as a store of wealth it has no real competition. For everyday use though there are far more better alternatives out there already. Time will tell i guess.

Can't dump what you do not have, more nonsense from CSW still peddling the fraud he is SN. Next claim will be he has lost/destroyed/unable to access the private keys.

Hahahaha yeah I was thinking the same

So cautious you still get looks for using a debit card for small purchases, at that rate BTC may be considered vetted sometime next century then.
All the while FINMA, the Swiss financial watchdog, has approved banking and securities dealer licenses to two new crypto banks.

Calvin is still tweeting up a storm backing his three legged horse as satoshi. Can't figure Calvin out, does he really believe it or has he just got too much invested to step away now. Either way he's been scammed.

There should have been ample grounds for a mistrial as well, Frost did some incredible things that were so outside if whats considered ok to do its not funny

I have a trezor 1, a trezor T and a ledger nano s, the trezor 1 is my favourite. The ledger is nothing but a pain in the ass and the model T trezor is fiddly to use with the tiny touch screen.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:28:21
Let me google that for you.. Dollar-cost averaging simply involves investing the same amount of money into, say, shares or managed funds at regular intervals over a long period – whether market prices are up or down.
@_date: 2019-12-28 08:33:21
People should cease speculating on this nonsense, CSW is a proven fraud stop giving him attention.
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:02:05
The Trezor T is great once you have logged in, the beta wallet has a lot of new coins that are not on the model 1. Its just the log in typing the pin on the tiny touch screen is a bit fiddly. If that doesn’t bother you then get one. The Ledger is shit, can only have three coins loaded on it at a time and uninstalling and reinstalling all the time makes it not fit for regular daily use.

They could not even give the court the supposed wallet addresses of the tulip trust holding those bitcoins. CSW should have been held in contempt, SV fanbois will claim it was a win for CSW but then the real Satoshi could come out tomorrow and sign a block the the genesis key and SV fanbois would still claim CSW was Satoshi at this point.
