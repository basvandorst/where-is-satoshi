Check your state laws, credit card fees are a part of doing business for the owner and he cannot pass that cost to his employees, it's an expense that has tax implications. If he is reporting to the IRS that this is a tax deduction from profits while also making you pay for that tax, it's very fraudulent.

Have you asked your landlord to setup a system with bitpay? Also who western unions rent to your landlord? And yes you can buy groceries with bitcoin.

1) If your carrying your debit card with your phone your security is much worse. It would be better to separate the two, carrying a device with massive amounts of personal information and a debit card is a good way to have an empty bank account. 
Sure, you could say that you would kill the phone, however would you be able to do it before a skilled thief disabled the radio or made a copy of all the data? I would suspect that a very skilled person would be able to disable the radios, crack the phone, and image the contents in a few hours, possibly in as little as one hour depending on transfer speeds and flash size.
2) Choosing merchants based on their processing technologies works for you but most people don't choose places this way, because it is inconvenient.
3) If this is true, and likely it will be, it still doesn't mean the death of credit card carrying.
4) Credit cards will evolve, and most likely in the form of "chip and pin" or "chip and signature" physical card systems. The fact remains that all credit cards and debit cards thus far, and probably in the near future, are issued by banks in the form of cards, not directly to mobile devices. Therefore one should always expect that the physical card issued by the bank will be more likely to work with all merchants over a clear standard, rather than proprietary mobile systems that don't necessarily share the same standards with other mobile systems. If banks choose not to issue cards in favor of virtual downloads, I would think that it absolutely would help adoption, but I don't think that is very likely in the next few years.

Also why does every article feel the need to bring up an altcoin as if it devalues bitcoin. If I'm a merchant I don't care if I'm payed in $20 of DOGE,LTC, or BTC, as long as I get my $20 I will be happy. 
The real value to bitcoin over altcoins is that the merchant can actually get payed his $20 because it has the infrastructure to make such transactions, the others not so much.

Given the Snowden evidence, TOR is compromised against government spy agencies that most likely have workarounds to the system. Such as the NSA having access to a foreign upstream Cisco router and having ways to defeat SSL traffic on the compromised router for example. Given the degree to which the USG will go to spy, it would seem more than likely they have already compromised the network.

Yes this is why you store them in plastic, sometimes twice. Also it's easier and cheaper to produce a two sided paper wallet and cut in half for duplication if needed.
It was not really a comment about metal vs paper. Some metal could have special coatings or have deeper engravings that would allow for better readability.

People can be the authority though, if we as the community say "we will only use exchanges that follow our common sense rules" and  "you will provide us with the level of service we would expect from a forex exchange, brokerage, or bank.". We will get it. They need our money to survive and many do make sensible changes.
I'll give you an example. When I first started using exchanges most didn't have two factor authentication. In fact in those days there was almost no account security, and there were many cases of exchange accounts being emptied. The community got together and told the exchanges that in order to get our business you need these security measures in place. Guess what now it is ubiquitous, almost every exchange features two factor now. No laws were passed, no government body stepped in and required it, the community and the exchanges worked together to make that happen.
Now lets look at the other side, in those days you could exchange as many bitcoins as you wanted completely anonymously. Then the government stepped in and FINCEN overreacted and said all bitcoin miners are "Money Transmitters", all exchanges will require at least two forms of ID, and all exchanging of bitcoins are a "Money Services Business". Since then they have revised and changed those slightly, but this is what they do. They go over the line and withdraw slightly on their positions.
IMO with billions lost, if the community doesn't do some "Self Regulation" (I know, you hate that I used the word regulation, I am sorry.) then the US Government will step in and make really inconvenient and crazy rules. Do you really want Joe Manchin to decide how we run our exchanges, or do you want bitcoineers deciding?

I like how he glosses over the fact of a $3 ATM fee. Maybe when your a TV personality with millions it seems like a small footnote. When you only have $20 in your account it's a huge percentage going to fees, and most people probably have less than $1000 at times. Banks give you the added pleasure of overdrafts if you go over as well, which again if you have 50k in your checking account you probably don't notice.
I think he also doesn't realize the fact that Bitcoin is more akin to wire transfers than credit/debit card. I have yet to have a bank that charged me less than $25 for a wire, sometimes more if they have an incoming wire fee structure. They charge even more for international wires, because international computers are some how different?

I think it is not helpful to focus on the wording of the subject line, and perhaps I should have used different wording but it would be more helpful to look at the content. I have listed four things that IMO would make bitcoin exchanges safer and more trustworthy. Maybe you agree with some or disagree with some, and any dialog in that direction would be helpful to the community. 
People can also suggest other common sense rules they would like to see from their bitcoin exchanges. If enough people feel strongly about a rule they would like to see then perhaps we can start a change.org petition or a reddit dialog on the subject and help enact those changes for the betterment of bitcoin. You say I should do something myself, why should other people not have a say?

If what you say is true about the hardware then it absolutely would be a steep hill to climb. The reality is that unified standards in payment systems for the mobile space are the only way to succeed. 
The banks will all get together and agree on a standard for their next generation cards at least in the US. Any NFC payment would be wise to stick to those same protocols or be left in the dust. I still have yet to see any NFC at an ATM either, so banks have a huge amount of pull as to which technology they will adopt and will become the standard. Like I said if you have to carry around the Bank's cards your going to use that for payment.

I asked about this with my tax professional. I specifically wanted to know how the IRS can determine a loss of a virtual currency when all that is needed to "own it" is a private key.
I wanted to know in the case of Bloomberg's revealing of a private key on national television how capital gains should be paid by the host, the guy who took the money, and the charity who received it. I also wanted to know how could someone prove, if not on national TV, that the money was actually not under their control.
The answer that was given was not good, basically it is up to the IRS and a tax court to determine if your story is believable or not. This post and advice doesn't constitute guidance on legal or tax matters in anyway, you should consult with your own professionals, etc, hold harmless, etc.

I don't really see this as being the same.
The Apple system would require a new credit card processing system hardware, but has no advantages in fees to the merchant. It is still a credit card system, just with a different interface. 
Bitcoin processing on the other hand, while also requiring new hardware has the possibility of at least offering faster access to funds for the merchant, reduces losses and accounting time from the cash drawer, lowers payment fees,no charge backs and allows stores to enforce refunds at their discretion.
Time will tell if transactions conducted using the ApplePay will not be allowed to do charge backs, I suspect the credit card companies will still allow this practice to occur. So what is the advantage in upgrading for the merchant at this time to recover hardware and integration costs?

Understanding the code and reading the code helps, but you need to have a good grasp of the protocol itself. You can do a lot with whats already been provided in the libraries and the protocol. 
For instance you should have a complete understanding of how to put a manual transaction together. You should understand what the script variables do and how they work.

Also just because one system was shown to have a flaw, such as banks failing and needing bailout, does not mean that one should forgo such measures for all cases. A huge bank is going to have way more options at fooling an accounting firm than a small Bitcoin exchange.

Why has no one mentioned the obvious downside to PHP? It's not compiled, and the source code can be easily read and changed if the server is compromised. If MagicalTux had compiled his code from C into a signed obfuscated dll we would most likely not have the inner workings of the code as we can see in PHP, and his site may be still up, maybe. He was pretty incompititent. Expect anything that's public to be compromised, including your code.
An exchange would perform much better in C++ or C# because you can build the software from the ground up, you don't rely on code running on top of a webserver. So a programmer only needs the components he wants for his program, he can remove extraneous webserver stuff that can cause bloated resources and security issues.

Bitcoin looks to replace cash, ApplePay looks to replace the entire wallet. Both suffer from similar adoption issues and require that merchants upgrade their hardware, software, and personnel training. 
Only Bitcoin promises to offer a return in lower fees and faster use of money, ApplePay does neither of these things. So why would a business want to spend the money and time to implement? Why would the consumer?

I suspect it is going down because mining is not profitable and there is tremendous pressure for miners to get rid of the bitcoin to recoup losses. 
IMO this had to happen, there was too many miners and too many machines made. Someone needed to go bankrupt. Once sanity comes to the mining market we should be back on track. 
There were people who paid 10 Bitcoin (or dollar equivalent) for a miner that would earn 8 Bitcoin. That same dollar equivalent would buy 25 Bitcoin now, so why buy a new machine rather than the Bitcoin on the open market? The mining market is still over saturated and that will take some time to return to profitability.

It should be said, because some of the people that operate these businesses are kinda dumb. 
I have visited many, and tried to get them to use bitcoins. Many don't know how to use a computer or had very minimal literacy of computers. 
I also found many were not willing to even bother to educate themselves. I think in time some of the more computer savvy owners will make the conversion. Many of the owners/operators are former/current street dealers. They work with the systems they know, cash and keeping minimal records for LE. I think the public information of the blockchain scared some of them as well.

Scenario: 
The "core devs" some of which are paid by large Bitcoin corporations decide to add coin verification, reverse payments, or some other change that is not favorable to the 51% miner. The 51% miner forks the bitcoin qt to create a version without the change, many in the community also agree with the 51% miner and agree to run his software and become nodes for the group. This group of users now has 51% of all the hash rate and has a loyal following of users. This will create a split Bitcoin fork until the changes are reconciled and all are running the same version. 
So there are two branches of Bitcoin in the scenario, Core Dev Bitcoin and Ghash.IO Bitcoin. Further, now 51% of your hashrate has possibly disappeared off the Core Dev Bitcoin network, leaving the difficulty impossibly high. This could cause major problems if something like this did happen and this threat alone could be enough to enact favorable changes for the 51% miner. The difficulty, block completion time, or security could be seriously degraded if he just stopped mining for the Bitcoin network with 51% of the total hashrate.
The 51% miner effectively becomes a near 100% miner for his branch of Bitcoin. Since he is the new core developer of his branch he may get to set some of the new rules, should the changes with the "core devs" not be reconciled and development continue. Certainly this is a hypothetical situation, but it is also a very real situation that has been discussed since the start of Bitcoin. It is especially more likely, when the community coalesces into centralized services, this includes the way the software itself gets published, not just mining or nodeing. 
The only thing that prevents this sort of activity from occurring is the argument that it's a huge disaster and so they wouldn't dare do it. Human nature, the history of money, and war can teach us that we are willing to do such things. There is almost no good reason to allow more centralized mining to occur, and so many reasons to prefer decentralized. The history of the altcoins that blew up from mining attacks clearly show that it can be a problem, even for the mighty Bitcoin.

There is always the possibility that a flaw in the software allows someone to figure out the private key. I would not recommend it because when you transfer btc into it will be immediately noticeable on the blockchain that this is most likely a vanity address and they can pretty much guess you used vanitygen to generate it.
As long a vanitygen has no random generation flaws your probably fine, but why risk such things for an offline storage solution that you wont be checking frequently?

I am calling out a reality of using payment systems in the real world. Rarely do technology systems look at all of the concerns of merchants and users in the real world. These are questions that I would want to know if I were a merchant.
As a user am I likely to still bring my wallet around because I find that I will still need them when things don't go according to plan? 
This is my personal experience with Passbook in the first place. At a concert I would still bring a paper copy of my ticket because I experienced the fact that the scanners and/or staff could not use the passbook ticket. The only place I could get my rewards card to work in passbook was at Walgreens. Every other scanner and store I tried to use it at fails, so I stopped using it.

People probably wont know when the key has been compromised. Also I'm not entirely sure that if I send a signed or half signed transaction the attacker can never derive my private key when the attacker has the other half + a copy of the full transaction and all data that the transaction was made up of. 
Either way it never stops an attacker from changing the Javascript to get my private key when I enter the information, depending on how they implement multisig. Website says open source but not actually posted anywhere, so I can't read make sure. 
I hope they don't start taking deposits before open peer review.

Maybe there is a flaw in the TFA implementation of Coinbases code. 
It is always possible that under certain circumstances there are ways to trick the software, such as inserting data in the memory register of a java script variable. If the OP is indeed sophisticated I would generally believe it very likely that coinbase could be at fault.
One cannot also ignore the fact that social engineering could have taken place with a Coinbase CS agent. Perhaps it is easier than thought to replace a TFA token through human interaction.

Pulling in your own code is not the same as having a community write and maintain standards. Who can pull in features into Bitshares?My impression is that I3 has the say, not an independent community.In Bitcoin everything moves slowly because there is a lot of developers with differing interests, they do a lot of discussion and testing before implementing sweeping changes.
My opinion is I3 changes the rules, to whatever they want and whenever they want. People have real live money in play, more communication and moving slower is a better thing IMO. If your going with a completely new form of securing the network, then I feel as if you should have massive community outreach. I have read many forum posts from concerned users without much acknowledgement from I3. I feel very much as if I3 will be moving forward with trustees even if a majority of users don't like it. This is not to say that the majority don't support it, at this point who would know without polling.
