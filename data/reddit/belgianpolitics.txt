Well yeah because EU regulations are different from EFTA regulations (Iceland, Norway). In EU: no tax on crypto's UNLESS you actively trade to make significant gains.

Oh hell no. Choosing between BTC and BCH is like choosing between Clinton and Trump.

Absolutely. But when the hype keeps sustaining it...it will make you money.

Some exchangers will close your account when you're a minor, they constantly do extra background checks on their users (like Coinbase) so if they see you're a minor...you're screwed, worry about that first.

It's nice to see the BTC dominance going under 50%. Finally. Am I going to get banned by the 14 year old mods now?

Because Bitcoin is not the future and should not in any way dictate the market more than 25%. Without the first mover advantage, no one would put its money into BTC in 2017/2018. You invested before 2017? Good, you deserve your gains. You invest in BTC after 2017? You are not a rational person. BTC's dominance is dangerous for us all.

...and it's going down

Wouldn't be surprised if it's going back to 12K within 24 hours but who knows. Nobody knows for sure what's going to happen. Might as well go for ATH run in this wild west world.

True but Bitcoin Futures Trading can do nasty things. Big boys are ready to speculate now. This is not a "natural" setback, this is something new for Bitcoin. No one knows what will happen.

Bitcoin futures trading has been opened. Can go both ways now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:28:02
Coinbase has closed accounts for people having BTC in betting sites. Be careful.

Worst subreddit in the crypto space. Full of kids who don't know anything about crypto and have no clue how to distinguish criticism from attacks. It's like a cult.

NEO can be great for some short term fun (very reactive towards rumours, goes nuts when China is mentioned), LISK will be one to watch for mid term gains and I've done some great things investing in WTC, ARK.

Same, better buy now.

That's debatable, I really believe in ETH and its potential. Will it grow as big as BTC? No. Will it grow at a similar rate to BTC from now on until 2020? Maybe. This month is a special month full of chaos, I hope ETH will have a 20-30% growth right after the fork, then stability and further on a solid monthly rate (unlike the past month). Some coins will go to the moon though (I'm looking a WTC, LISK and NEO).

I'm in no means an expert but one could argue (conservative view) that both BTC and ETH are not only now, but also for the next 3+ years the 2 main crypto's competing. Obviously, there is a significant difference in technology behind the two but I'll leave that to the more technically schooled investors here on reddit. Both will most likely grow 5x+ in the next 3 - 4 years (and that's still rather pessimistic). My guess is that BTC will stay the main crypto power but ETH could give your investment a bigger return. Choosing between BTC and ETH is basically deciding if you want to take a slightly bigger risk for a slightly bigger return (%). The fight between NEO and ETH will get interesting in the next 2 years though and might decide this debate. In the end both are good investments. And no, it is not too late to get involved! In my opinion we're still in the mid early adaptor phase (technology adoption life cycle theory).

You can always invest in Ethereum when you feel like you missed out on BTC, it had a decent pullback since this summer. But it's also still worth to get involved in BTC obviously. Best advice I can give you: only spend money you don't need.

Stack it every month. Also, invest some in altcoins (those that can have big time short term gains) and invest those gains in BTC. That's how I did it. I basically managed to fuel my BTC investments with short or mid-term (3 months) altcoin gains. You do have to invest a lot of time in researching the right altcoins at the right time.
