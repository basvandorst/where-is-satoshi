The random spikes don't seem to have any pattern to them, the fact it happened last year is irrelevant.
Much better to look at long term trends, which are good.

ARIMA assumes that the data is stationary and univariate. The second is true, the first isn’t, but this is auto.arima which can be used with non stationary data.

My view is invest in bitcoin an amount which you are prepared to lose. Such an amount if lost, which it might well be, would not damage your life plans. I would not sell a house or my dog to buy bitcoins.

I don’t think the system is in equilibrium, if you ignore the fluctuations there appears to be a clear trend which will likely continue to some extent until what is driving the upwards growth stops, like increasing users stop increasing. Then you might have an equilibrium or steady state of sorts I suppose, with fluctuations.

I dont think this is any way to talk to anyone even on reddit. You sound like an angry 19 year old. You need to learn to chill.
Of course you can automate many things in statistical modelling, that's usually preferable. Yes, maybe I could check the residuals for normality. But this is just a blog so it isn't a big deal.
Using ARIMA on univariate time course data like this is pretty common to get an approximate prediction. Yes, we all know there are other variables that we can't take into account, but it is OK to simplify things sometimes.
