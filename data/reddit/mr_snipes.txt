If ppl will have lost their coins from a coinbase hack roger will probably declare that insider hacking is fine and no crime in his opinion. As long as you only steal btc.

The problem i see in comparison with let's say a regular coin is that you have most likely never seen the real thing, yet. So if i make it look nice and same as on these pictures, how could one tell i am selling a fake ? I could print a public address on it which has a valid balance and if you do not open it, you will not know the private key in it is "getRektLol"

all these threads put salt in my old wound of selling my btc for a few bucks, because i was sure it will collapse into nothing. At the time i was happy i got my power-cost and some extra-cash back.

If they put all that heat to good use by heating water and households nearby, they could reduce costs and make it a bit greener. I hope such an approach will be profitable for farms designed to run several years.

There was a S9 mod with watercooling iirc. it was way more exp. It all comes down to fast roi I guess.

These satellites will make it possible for some to keep using it, good point. That stuff will be above most people's skillset to get running though im afraid

The interesting question is weither they will block contact to full nodes for Bitcoin. They run deep packet inspection enabling them to detect attempts to connect to VPN. Imho they can also detect if you run the btc client and disrupt its network communication.
