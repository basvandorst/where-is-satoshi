Shut up and give me a "shut up and give me bitcoin" bitcoin metal wallet card!

Yes, I understand the comfirmation process -- but even in the Wiki, the chart shows that the probability of it taking 70 minutes for a block is almost 0%.  And the one I mentioned took 75.  I was just curious if it was something beyond the normal "poisson process" stuff.  Even in the text, the Wiki says that it could take "a whole hour" - and, again, this one was 25% longer than that even.  So, I was just curious about it.  Seems fine now.

I'm in the USA and actually take credit cards as a Merchant. This IS how it works with most Merchant agreements.

Thanks!  That's the sort of discussion I was looking for, but couldn't find.  It's a good read.  (Although, in the end, that discussion literally goes on for 6 years and still ends up at the same place I was when I asked the question -- they basically say "Yeah, it just isn't going to happen that you can really verify it, so the seller would have to decide to hope/trust that it gets confirmed."
In other words, in 6+ years of talking about it, they are still going "hopefully a future change/tech will solve this."

Care to say which law is being violated here and why you disagree with a well-known FAQ that is linked to above that pretty well explains WHY it is legal then?  Or just going to go "no it's not" with absolutely nothing to back that up?

I used my GRLC profit to buy my wife a watch. So maybe I can get myself one this time!

Actually, if I wanted to buy a house, I think ETH might make more sense -- it's really designed for those sorts of transactions, right?
But, yes, I get your point.  I guess the answer to my question really is: Bitcoin isn't designed for that.  Use Litecoin instead (like you said).  :)
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:09:11
Got ya.  My transaction got picked up in block 479751, so I'm finally getting some confirmations.  Thanks.

As other have said, it is the "smart contract" part of it that makes ETH attractive for such things.  And not really for the "mold guarantee" that was mentioned.  Instead, the reality is that buying a house has lots of payments coming IN and OUT.  There is often an existing mortgage that needs to be paid off.  Property taxes get divided up a bit oddly.  Things like that.  I think ETH would work well for that, in theory, in that everything would have to be in place and then all the transfer would happen at the same time.  So, it isn't just a matter of Buyer-paying-Seller.  It is NewMortgageHolder-pays-Buyer; Buyer-pays-Seller using some of those Bank funds and some of their own for down payment; Seller-pays-existing-bank-mortgage-older; Both-pay-a-bit-of-property-taxes; and so on.  Makes it a bit complex -- where a smart contract makes a lot of sense.

But it IS different from accepting credit cards or fiat.  In general, Merchants (in the USA) are protected from credit card fraud (at least, today, if they do it via chip instead of swipe).  So, if I'm a Merchant selling that drink and donut for $7 and the guy inserts his credit card and it gets instantly approved, then I'm going to get paid for that drink and donut.  Even if it turns out later that the credit card was stolen and the charge was fraudulent.  The Merchant is protected in that case.  So, it's clearly "different" from the Bitcoin issue.

It's funny because the article from 2010 that linked to (where even Satoshi is answering) has the same sort of response -- basically: "Well, years from now, future improvements will solve this."  And, now, 6 years later, some newbie is asking the exact same question and getting the same "it'll work later" answer.  :)

Did you even read it yourself?  That law very specifically requires INTENT "to render such bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt unfit to be reissued."  Clearly, the person putting this stamp on it WANTS it to circulate so that others can see it.  This is NOT "intent to render it unfit to be reissued" which is required to violate 18 USC 333.
More info here if you are interested in more support that stamping bills like this is legal:

I think some people here are missing that there is more to it than just the double-spend scenario that Satoshi mentioned.  And, heck, even his method of getting around that required having a full node readily available.  I'm not convinced that everyone that would want to take Bitcoin would have that.  I mean, we're talking about Mom-and-Pop shops as it is.  They likely just have a WALLET, not a full node handy for pre-confirmation.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:42:09
Yes, but this only works because in Satoshi's response it is required that the merchant is either running a full node or has direct access to one.  Otherwise, they could not easily detect the double-spend.  However, in my example with the donut shop, this is much more likely to be a mom-and-pop shop that doesn't have a full node -- they probably just have a wallet.  (A guy posted just a day or two ago about him accidentally paying 4 times in this exact situation -- where it was just some guy with a food truck or something and a wallet.)
So, I think this assumption that you could just wait 10 seconds and check for a double-spend is a stretch.  If this were to work for small vendors, they wouldn't necessarily be running a full node to check for that.  They'd just have a wallet.

No, up until yesterday they were NOT the "same coin."  Up until yesterday, only one of them existed at all.  If you keep saying that they were "the same coin" up until yesterday, then YOU are adding to that confusion and making it worse.  It makes much more sense to explain to people that up until yesterday, BCC simply didn't exist.

Again, as I said, I'm not talking about chargebacks.  Chargebacks are different from fraudulent use of a card.  They are covered by different parts of our Merchant agreement.  We were talking about people using stolen or fraudulent cards.  In THOSE cases, as Merchants, we are still paid -- provided that the chip was used.  (It used to cover swipes too, but that changed in 2015 with the EMV Liability Shift.)
So, if a customer does a chargeback -- then we get a chance to try to prove that the purchase was properly verified (that it was swiped, that they signed if it was over the designated amount, and so on).  In this case, there is a chance that we will not be paid.
However, in the case that a card has been stolen or otherwise used fraudulently, for example, we would STILL be paid -- because VISA or MC handles that "insurance" for us.  We, as Merchants, are not penalized for something outside of our control.
I'm not referring to PayPal at all.  And we're actually using First Data Omaha through Flagship Merchant Services.  Again, a legit CHARGEBACK would be on us -- but a stolen or faked card (which is more like what we're talking about here) would not be on us.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:32:42
No, actually, it isn't.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:13:19
That would only be in the case of a chargeback where the credit card user tried to argue that they didn't even MAKE the transaction for that drink &amp; donut.  That's not really the same.  A better comparison would be someone using a fraudulent or stolen credit card.  In THOSE cases, a chargeback isn't issued against the Merchant and they are still paid like usual (as long as they did a Chip purchase and not Swipe).
So, I don't see how Bitcoin is an improvement over credit cards for risk management.  I grant that you can't do a "chargeback" against Bitcoin -- but, with a credit card, the Merchant is protected from fraudulent/stolen cards.
(Note that I'd agree with you fully if we didn't have the 10-minute-delay confirmation problem.  I agree that a CONFIRMED Bitcoin purchase is an improvement over credit cards.  But that's the whole point of my post: these would be unconfirmed.)
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:13:30
Again, that stamp does not make the bill "unfit to be reissued."  Therefore, it does not violate 18 USC 333.
If you disagree with that, then it is up to YOU to provide a case where someone WAS prosecuted for just stamping on money and it was found that it WAS, therefore, "unfit to be reissued."
The ONLY cases I can find all relate to ADVERTISING on money (which is why the WheresGeorge.com stamps had some legal issues).  But that is not the case with this stamp.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:00:54
Agreed - but no one is really doing that. Even the BCH fans call it "Bitcoin Cash".  There are very few people talking about BCH and just calling it "Bitcoin." This seems like a straw man argument.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:41:01
That comment is a guy suggesting that BTC be called "Bitcoin Slow" or "Bitcoin Fees". You must see that that is not a serious post from the average BCH person.  Come on.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:47:09
You'll notice that even in your examples, they still call it "Bitcoin Cash."  Arguing about which one they think is more what was "intended" or is like the "whitepaper" is different than using the wrong name in normal usage. We're talking about what to call it - that's different than arguing some technical aspects. Again, the vast majority of BCH people are not trying to just call it "Bitcoin" as was suggested here.  My point is that there is no reason for Bitcoin users to call BCH "Bcash" over "Bitcoin Cash."  It just continues a pointless argument/debate over a naming problem that mostly isn't widespread.
