Thanks for the reply. I want to open a platform to buy and sell crypto (bitcoin in specific) here in the Middle East region and North Africa. What I can see is that there is a lot of people willing to invest in Cryptocurrency but do not know how. I’m not good at coding and these stuff. Thanks for the reply I will check out what you sent.

Amazing! How much should I invest in bitcoin? And how many cryptos do you suggest one should have in their portfolio? Currently I’m at 0.65 BTC, 20000 ADA and some verge.

Do you think that bitcoin will reach 20k in the near future? And The main question is that when bitcoin reached its highs who were the main players/investors and are they no longer interested, that is the main question
