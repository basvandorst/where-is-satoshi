But for the record I have complete faith that bitcoin will one day become mainstream and will succeed.

But why not call bitcoin what it really is an investment with another useful purpose of being able to use it as a currency. I would think if people thought bitcoin was a commodity millions more would pour money into bitcoin to hold as an investment. How many people do you know buy currencies? I don't know any. But everybody I know loves to invest there money. I just think bitcoin got started being called the wrong thing right out of the gate.

You would think with all the money the bitcoin foundation has they could hire a company to send out at least 100 million emails to get the ball rolling. I only know like 30 people so I can get 30 into the mix lol.

But there's 6 billion people on earth. If bitcoin becomes mainstream one day its absurd to think that in 5 years when there's say 12.5-13 million bitcoin in existence that 12 million out of 6 billion people wouldn't try to buy a bitcoin a day. Maybe not this Monday but down the road its very likely that more people would try to purchase a bitcoin than bitcoin available in a specific day.

Why would I want the price to rise now while I'm trying to accrue as many coins now before the big day they hit 1000? If your looking at bitcoin as an investment tool instead of a currency any smart investor who is looking to add to there portfolio wants the price to stay as low as possible until the day they cash out. Only then would a smart investor want to see it at historic heights.
