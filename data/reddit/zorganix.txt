I told my mom around 5k, her response “I don’t trust it”. Even now at 10k she is still not interested. I text her every week or so reminding her to buy still. Hopefully she comes around before 20k. I think the 80% correction was hard for that generation to understand

Spot on
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:40:06

@_date: 2019-11-23 00:10:55
No big tittie b**ches? Lame
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:59:57
Just turn your phone/computer upside down, and remember why you purchased any bitcoin in the first place. If your hands are shaken, take a breath and man up
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:41:54
Ok, so day 6 we moon?

Because anything bought from a kiosk is not of serious value as bitcoin is attempting to be. Name one other thing (i once saw a gold dispersing atm in Dubai other than this) that can by taken seriously  by banks and institutions that is bought from a kiosk?

Unfortunately Greg left us when bitcoin hit 20k. RIP

If you’re trying to buy bitcoin at a gas station you probably don’t have enough money to buy more than a few sats
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:57:29
Not with solar
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:44:03
Edit. Then buy back at 10.9
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:03:01
Not a good example. Who is still using mp3?
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:28:50
Well put

I almost thought that 1$ sign was a “like” sign on my feed lolll
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:02:19
These kiosks make bitcoin look like a joke, I do not think this is good advertising. It makes the public look at bitcoin as a novelty
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:28:59
So.. how does bitcoin work after an emp?
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:16:08
What did it look like last year at this time?

@_date: 2019-08-13 03:45:42
Bs.... says it’s all
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:38:25
Or simply wishing I would have had more funds when I did buy in
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:12:34
My wallet is ready
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:41:42
Eat now, or be future rich?
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:42:13
I have access to solar already set up that is paying the government for overages which could be going to bitcoin..
@_date: 2019-12-03 01:06:45
Looks really nice, but did you color it in black with a sharpie?

Crypto will be the currency in which esports adopt and endorse. This is genius, subtle hint to their young users as this will be the currency of the internet aka the currency of the future

I disagree, I feel stints like this that are marketing Schemes are the beginning of adoption.
Edit: adoption of “internet coins”
