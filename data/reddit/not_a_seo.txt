Most people can drink a beer in &gt;5min. Where do you live and how old are you that you think 22 min a beer is acceptable or normal?
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:35:38


Damn, you either drink beer very very slow or i'm a straight up full fledged alcoholic.

Looks more like spammers spamming CL. Same thing has been going on for years.

Not much comes up on Google for query: "french customs" "bitcoin" besides them using them to bust SR and dark market vendors.

These are excellent my man! You will definitely be seeing the BTC community using them on websites in the near future :) If you could make some ones, that would be even more epic! &lt;3 sending some BTC your way!

DAE think this person should be called DumberThanEveryone2014? Its **SO** cute how bankers make shill accounts to try and discredit bitcoin ;D
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:31:05
It should have included Leah Goodman too IMO

Now what would French customs want Bitcoins for an 'operation' for?
[**Is this what they did with your bitcoins?**]( Looks like it.
I guess companies will do anything for a few easy bucks these days..

Read and believe whatever types.

I completely agree. All drug dealers need to learn is how to tumble their BTC and use PGP encryption for all addresses and communication with buyers.
