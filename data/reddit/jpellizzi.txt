Here's a potentially stupid question...
Where do these bots come from and how do they interact with the exchange (let's say GDAX)?
Is there an API behind the scenes that they're tapping into to place orders, or are they actually functioning on the GDAX website and able to click/type/confirm orders like a person with a keyboard/mouse?
And with huge volumes to work with, can we assume these are financial institutions or just hardcore early adopters/day traders by profession?

Luckily they seem to be operating in the US... maybe consult an attorney?  You’re taking about enough money that it should be worth the cost for an hour consultation.

They’re taxed as capital gains... same as stocks and other assets.
Short term vs long term, cost basis etc.

Yeah I wouldn’t worry about losing your funds (unless the price takes a nose dive), just sucks that you have no control over them for the time being.  
Hope you get it sorted out!

You can move your coins into the Coinbase Vault, which requires 2FA + email confirmation and a 2 day waiting period to withdraw, during which you can call them and cancel the transfer.
Also the coins in their hot wallets are insured against a hack or issues on their end, but not if your account is compromised.  There’s some gray area with the Vault/Cold Storage but overall I think it’s as safe as any other online service can be.

Put it in perspective... let’s say you pay a $3 fee to buy $50 worth of BTC on Coinbase.
That’s 6% right there.  Bitcoin would have to go up to ~$16400 as of this posting for you to break even.
If Bitcoin doubles to $33000 over the course of the next few months, you made ~$50 profit, minus the short term capital gains tax you’re supposed to pay.
If it goes up 20% to $18500, you made a whopping $7 ($10-$3 fee)
Not trying to discourage you, but it’s all percentage based like any other investment.  Don’t let the big numbers scare you, but also realize the days of $100 turning into millions are probably behind us.
Note:  All loose math and estimates with the price hovering around $15500 as of me typing this

Went from $16300 to $15000 in about 30 seconds and now it’s sporadically updating in the mid $15000s.
Fun times

I bought my first coin on July 26th and it showed up in my wallet ON August 1st... and I didn’t get BCash :( 
Probably missed it by a few hours but I’m still going to contact Support once the hype dies down.

Coinbase can generate a tax report for you.  It’s not legally binding in any way, just gives you a list of all your transactions and cost basis.
Keep in mind Coinbase counts a Send/Transfer off exchange as a sell, so you’ll still have to go through your actual transactions and see which ones were realized gains/losses and which were just sending to another wallet.

Well if “They”did pump the price up in an attempt to profit from a big short, this dip happening too early.  Futures aren’t open yet so this doesn’t make much sense with that theory.
Maybe there will be a big run up once futures open, who knows?  Still at the ATH from a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:18:09
Gotcha, yeah I agree.

I don’t get why I keep seeing all these horror stories about fees... I sent $600 for ~$15 today from Coinbase to Binance and it showed up in about an hour.
Does it not scale based on the amount you’re sending?

After following BTC on and off for a few years, I finally bought my first 5 coins 2 days ago at $430 from Coinbase after cashing out my stocks and was just planning on using it for Amazon/purse io.
Was not ready for this shit storm.  Feeling kind of dumb.  I still have faith though.

I also didn’t receive any BCH... I purchased BTC from Coinbase on July 26th and got a confirmation email on August 1st, but maybe it hit my Coinbase wallet too late after the fork and I missed the boat.
Really sucks, and I want to contact support but I know I have no chance in hell of getting a response in time.

Working fine for me

Aaaaand we're on our way back up.
Bought a bit more at 7150 and I'll call it a day.

I've used it for a few orders and always saved more than 20%.  Some were pretty complicated multiple item orders, and the person making my purchase was always responsive and polite.
It's a great service, and a nice way to hedge your wallet.  I bought 5 coins at $438 right before the Mike Hearn fiasco, and I still broke even because I was saving 20%+ on everything I bought.

IIRC it does say that their virtual currencies are insured in the event that they get hacked.  It's only if your account is compromised that you're SOL

Withdrawals require 2 factor authentication and have a 2 day window to cancel before the coins leave the vault.
