You would have to create the same transaction again with a higher fee.  Your wallet might not be able to help you but basically you would have to have the exact same inputs and outputs as the one you sent previously and then add on a higher fee

No, the LN is a peer to peer network that requires no trust. Bakkt is really just a bitcoin bank.
@_date: 2018-09-16 00:54:19
When a channel is closed they only need to broadcast their final state to the network.  The only way you can lose your money is if the person on the other side of the channel tries to broadcast a previous state that is in their favor, but if your node broadcasts a more recent state in 48 hours you would then get all their bitcoin for them trying to cheat you.  So you don't need to trust anyone as long as your node is functioning.
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:34:50
Well yes, that is essentially what is a 51% attack is, however it is highly unlikely to happen and gets harder and harder as more hash power is added to the network

From my understanding, it can only be done through side chains. There isn't a mimblewimble transaction, it's an entirely different way to do a blockchain.  If bitcoin wanted to use mimblewimble fully it would need to create an entirely new chain

Depends where your money is 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:38:35

Monero, ZCash, and Ethereum all can't hold a candle to Bitcoin. Firstly, it is almost impossible for them to succeed along side Bitcoin.  There would be no reason we have 4 global currencies, basic monetary economics shows that the world settles onto one form of money and will generally trend to the hardest money (which is Bitcoin). Second, those projects are all completely centralized and are littered with technological issues. All 3 are ran by a small group of people and in all 3 those small groups of people have shown how much power they have and have abused it. In Monero's case it's their ASIC resistance hard fork they do every so often, in ZCash's case it's their inflation bug that took them a year to fix where the developers could have been printing free money on top of their already centralized developer tax, and for ethereum there is almost too many to list: DAO hack, no set monetary policy, Vitalik switching to PoS, hard forks being canceled the night before based from 1 phone call, infura, their ability to spout buzzwords for scaling solutions but actually do none of them, etc. 
Bitcoin is the only crypto currency that is actually decentralized and has actually proven how resistant it is. Bitcoin will be the only one able to survive when governments begin to attack and is our best chance at having a sound money. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:33:41
Problem is there is no "accepting" of a payment, a transaction just gets mined and now you have the ability to spend, you never authorize the transaction.  However, in LN you do in a way accept a payment by publishing the secret key you receive that you broadcast for everyone on the route to recieve their payment as well.

They can track you if you are careless, however, if you want to be anonymous it is possible, it just requires a lot of work.  You need to do everything over tor and make sure you are mixing your coins properly and verifying your transactions with your own node.  Also, privacy isn't the only benefit of bitcoin, you also get censorship resistance, so the FBI can no longer freeze your money and prevent you from transacting.

1.	Basically ver got salty that bch posts were taken down on 2.	Increasing the block limit can do a lot of damage to bitcoin. First it's a hard fork which forces people to upgrade their nodes (talk about centralization), second it's not guaranteed to solve the problem because blocks can just fill up again and then we'll just need to do another hard fork creating a never ending cycle.  Third it will dramatically increase the amount of data storage and bandwidth needed to run a full node which will lead to only major data centers being able to run nodes (check of eth). Finally, lightning isn't just a blockstream product, there are many different implementations be created by multiple different teams, also lightning is live on test net right now so you don't even need to wait.

If price gets too low then miners would need to shut off their machines until it was profitable for them. It's fine if a small amount of miners do so in the speratic 30% drops but if we had a big enough drop that &gt;50% of the miners dropped out then we'd have a significant problem because it would then be possible that the unused hashrate could attack the network. Doing so would require a whole lot of coordination and would likely be impossible but it is still a concern.

I never said that a middleman is required for bitcoin, Liquid is literally just an optional product built for exchanges to increase liquidity.  Using Liquid is in no way required or necessary, it only gives exchanges an option to send transactions through the sidechain for faster transaction speeds.  Bitcoin does not change at all with Liquid existing, if people want to use a sidechain for their transactions there is no way to stop them and that is a good thing.

That actually isn't for sure. If bitcoin truly succeeds then it will become the most liquid store of value asset on the planet. If that happens, stocks will shift more to a speculative nature rather than a store of value like they are currently. It's completely possible that the global stock market takes a large hit from this as people who are just saving money for retirement or whatever move their money to bitcoin because they no longer need to seek yield to fight inflation.

That's part of it. But also with fiat you need a 3rd party to transfer it electronically (VISA, PayPal, a bank, etc). With bitcoin you can transfer money electronically without needing a 3rd party because of its decentralized network. This is important because a centralized 3rd party could deny you from making transaction because of who you are or who you are sending money to and when sending one country's currency to another you can also run into issues.   With bitcoin you don't have any of these issues because of its open, decentralized design. 
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:47:55

So the best economic system is a system that thrives off people needing to put money into companies just so they aren't losing purchasing power?  How about an economy where your money stays the same value or goes up in value and you can invest in companies when you actually see them as a worthwhile investment that will increase your purchasing power.  Inflation makes it possible for businesses to be "profitable" when they are actually only outpacing inflation and allows malinvestment to be rewarded because the money producer (the government) is taking purchasing power away from everyone and giving it to themselves.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:56:10
You're correct but there are other factors that will contribute as well.  Bitcoin being a superior store of value than any other asset allows other current store of values to be merely priced based on their utility and not as a store of value (ie real estate, stocks, etc).

For something that has 0 cost this is true, but how are you going to convince a company that they need to retrain all of their engineers to rebuild their entire system so it can be built on top of this new system that is only 10% better for the user, and all the users are still currently using the old system.

I 100% believe that bitcoin will overtake the current financial system, but do NOT do this.  This is incredibly risky and stupid, even if bitcoin does to 10k and you have the potential to make a shit ton of money you can still end up losing money here.  You will need to be paying off the loan after you receive it and you will need to be paying the interest as well.  If Bitcoin his 10k in a year this wouldn't be a problem but it completely possible it takes 5 years and you end so deep in debt from this loan you need to sell your coins for a loss and end up way worse off than before.  If you really really really wanted to take out a loan to buy Bitcoin (even though you shouldn't) take out a reasonable amount that won't leave you struggling financially forever if Bitcoin ends up going to 0 (like half a car or something).

In Venezuela when their currency was being hyper inflated they didn't keep their wealth in their native currency that sought other assets to preserve their wealth so it all wasn't lost to inflation.

We could easily write a new internet protocol that is 20-30% better, it could greatly reduce costs for people and make it more private and secure for the users.  However, it will never become adopted. Hypothetically lets create this new protocol.  Maybe Amazon starts using our new internet protocol, but now they need to build devices that understand this new protocol and get users to buy them, even though it won't be compatible with the old internet so the users now need 2 devices, one to access Amazon and one to access the old internet.  Amazon could support both, but now there is no real reason to use the old protocol, why would I buy a new phone/computer/tablet that I can only use to access amazon, when I can just use the stuff I already have.  Network effects are extremely strong and when you incur a cost to switching it makes them even stronger.
The market does decide but is still comprised of individuals that have to weigh costs and benefits to make a decision.

1) it is a permissioned system (someone needs to sell you coins vs just burning electricity)
2) there is no actual way to do it securly without long range attack vectors 
3) PoS is naturally centralizing as the stakers do not have costs so once you have a good chunk of the coins it is impossible to dethrone you. In PoW I can find cheaper electric and make better ASICS to compete with you and you can lose your share of power if you do not constantly innovate

You're understanding is a bit off. Miners aren't the ones storing and validating bitcoin's rules, they are merely the ones with the ability to add to the blockchain. I and many other people run bitcoin nodes that store the chain and validate against the consensus rules, if a miner tried to break these rules our nodes would reject the block and the miner would have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars on energy to produce that block. 
Also you're still thinking that mining power is in China, this is just wrong. China is just mainly the homes of mining pools but a pool has no power of hashrate if they start acting out of the miners interests.

Bitcoin has a fixed supply with no central issuer so states can no longer print their own money in a hyper-bitcoinized world.
Bitcoin can be used privately if you know what you are doing and it is only getting easier to do so. If bitcoin can be used privately the state can no longer track everyone's income and easily tax everyone.  Bitcoin is also unconfiscatable so they can only collect taxes the people willfully give and they can no longer garnish wages or freeze bank account unless the citizen allows it.
With all these properties, Bitcoin greatly increases the costs required to run a government by removing easy streams of money that exist for them today.

It doesn't stop them but there is no reason for it to have value in a hyper-bitcoinized world.


If a government declare bitcoin illegal it will only section itself off from the rest of the financial world the same way North Korea is from the internet. The citizens will have to use fiat but they will swiftly destroy any economy that have because no one will want to accept their money. 


These purchases can also be done privately and will much harder to tell if they need to be taxed.  The idea here is that it won't completely remove taxes but it will make it harder to do, so in theory the amount of taxation should reduce.

Literally nothing could fall under that definition then, gold is widely accepted as sound money, but the price of gold vs bitcoin sky rocketed in 2018 because of bitcoin's price falling, that would mean gold's value was suddenly appreciating. 
Sound money is a result of an assets stock to flow ratio, with bitcoin being the first asset ever to have one better than gold. 
The reason bitcoin's value has such sudden spikes and depreciation is because of how small of an asset it is and because it's use is 99% speculative. As Bitcoin grows and becomes bigger and bigger it's value will eventually become more stable. 
It isn't sound money yet, technically, but it has the properties of sound money, so as it grows it will become more and more sound.
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:48:38
You're the missing the point, yes, bitcoin currently is not sound money because of how small it is and because it is basically a pure speculative asset. 
However, it has the properties of sound money and if it became the global currency, it would give people the ability to have sound money. Currently the US dollar can be considered "sound money" because it generally has about 2% inflation and is relatively stable otherwise, however, this is all stringent on the choices of the few members of the federal reserve. At any moment they could change that fact and destabilize the US dollar. 
Bitcoin has the best properties for sustainable stable money or by definition sound money. It hasn't reached that yet because of how new and small it is but if it does it will be sound money.

Yes this version is available but is only supported with lnd.  The neutrino final proposals are planning on having coinbase commits of the block filters and will require a soft fork. When the final version of neutrino is added as a consensus rule and is in bitcoin core then I'd say it's live on main net. I understand that the version created by lightning labs works but it's not the final version of what neutrino is supposed to be.

Did anyone have to convince you to use your native currency, no.  People use a currency because it is what everyone around them is using, otherwise it is does not function as a currency if no one accepts it.  Every cryptocurrency combined pales in comparison to Bitcoin when comparing actual use and adoption and this trend will continue just by the fact of how centralized all the coins are and will likely implode on themselves.

A bitcoin node is basically a program you run on a computer that verifies the bitcoin blockchain, and is how you get data about bitcoin transactions that occur in a trustless way.
A Lightning Node is separate to a bitcoin node, but requires that you run a bitcoin node first. What a Lightning node does is allow you to use bitcoin's lightning network so you can transact much faster and (most likely) much cheaper. Lightning is still very new and in the early stages of being developed but there are actually a lot of use cases already.

Oh boy we got a lot to get into...
First, the dollar isn't available to over 7 billion people on the planet. Next, we got the fact that you can easily build a system where transactions are in escrow and not sent until both users have confirmed that there was no fraud.  Using dollars digitally has always been a purely trusted and permissioned system where you need a 3rd party (VISA, Venmo, a bank) to process and store digital dollars.  This all can be negated by bitcoin and the user has 100% control over their own money and don't need someone else deciding what happens with their money.
It honestly sounds like you got burned trading bitcoin and now just are butthurt over it so you despise it.

You should read [The Bitcoin Standard]( you see value from a weird standpoint.  Generally, things gain monetary value because of how hard they are to obtain or create.  Bitcoin is the more pure form of decentralized digital scarcity that no other coin can replicate.  Bitcoin will always have value unless someone finds a way to make it not scarce anymore.  Things like commodities are essentially the same way, sunlight is useful for creating energy but because it isn't scarce it has no monetary value, but something like oil which require work to get from the ground and refine to make usable energy, it then has value because of its scarcity.  Bitcoin is in the same vein where it creates a digital entity that is scarce while also being digital which was never done before without a controlling 3rd party.
@_date: 2018-11-05 01:46:11
You could say the exact same thing about any asset if people find that oil is not valuable anymore the price will plummet as well.  What makes something a scam is where people are just printing money as an ICO and giving their self of multimillion-dollar evaluation and then creating something that has little to no use case or something that does not work.

Okay, this is honestly the most ignorant thing I've ever seen.  A company can have bitcoin and then pay their employees with said bitcoin.

You're thinking about bitcoin in the wrong way. Bitcoin is a MONETARY innovation not a technological. Even if a coin has better privacy or transaction speed, it doesn't matter because this is money.

The core protocol hasn't changed since Segwit.  The reason fees rose so much was because Segwit was around 10%-20% adoption and batching wasn't being used by lots of exchanges.  So today if we had the same number of transactions the same thing would happen, however since people/exchanges are using block space more efficiently with more Segwit transactions and more exchanges using batching, fees are lower.  Now if all those exchanges were batching transactions then and if segwit as being used at the rates it's being used today (45%-50%) but with the same volume outputs (I say outputs because this is the number of addresses receiving bitcoin rather than the number of actual transactions in a block), well it's hard to say but I guess that we would have higher fees but not at the same level.

Dogecoin doesn't have a hashrate that could power entire countries securing it. Bitcoin is much much different than every other piece of garbage in coinmarketcap
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:10:16
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:05:53
It has the properties of a good store of value and as the market cap grows and it stops being a such a speculative asset then it can be a stronger store of value. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 02:55:21
Gold, oil, silver, these are all commodities that are not 'backed' by anything, the FIAT currency you likely use everyday are not backed by anything but I assume you give all these things value

Yeah, get your bitcoin off an exchange. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 01:35:55
Well at least one of them isn't a scammer
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:17:37
Don't use anything like bitpay or coinbase, they actively had tried to hurt bitcoin.  I'd highly recommend [BTC Pay Server](  Using this allows you to accept transactions under your own node so you don't need to trust a 3rd party.  Also, it allows you to accept transactions through LN.
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:23:45
It's possible but very unsafe. To do this the party opening the channels would have to have the private keys beforehand and once the user gets their wallet there would be nothing stopping the other party from stealing all their bitcoins. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 03:16:06
What gives it value is scarcity just like how seashells served as money for some ancient tribes, because it was something very scarce in their area. If you can't understand why something scarce has value then I can't help you. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:26:42
This is just because the ACH transaction is processing. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:46:55

Okay if you honestly believe that, there's no point in arguing 
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:26:43
So they are super far away from being able to steal keys. Adding a Qbit is exponentially harder for each Qbit that you add.

@_date: 2019-01-19 02:55:51
Well I offer to give him the book because it will do a better job explaining it than me but I can explain it if you like. 
1.	If crypto currencies do succeed Bitcoin is the one that will. Money, blockchains, and just internet systems in general require a network and Bitcoin has by far the most the biggest network and the longest history. Every other coin the space is a extremely centralized and can't hold a candle to Bitcoin. If you're thinking of Bitcoin as a technological innovation then you're not seeing what it is. Bitcoin is a money with an unchangeable monetary policy that give people the ability to store value in a way that is permissionless and that knows no borders. It has a payment system baked into it but that is not it's primary function, just like the dollars you hold, you hold them to eventually trade them for goods/services but their primary function is to store your value that you put in during work. Credit cards, PayPal and the like is the payment network that Bitcoin is "competing" with but if you believe that Bitcoin's payment network is the main innovation you're an idiot. 
2.	Having a US Dollar or FIAT backed coin is completely useless.  The current banking system does everything that this would do but better, they can have actual customer service and can operate much more efficiently. This also requires a centralized entity to be backing the coins but this is a regulatory nightmare and wouldn't be allowed if it go to any actual size. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:46:32
Yes, currently Bitcoin is inflationary but as the block reward gets lower and lower it becomes closer and closer to being deflationary (when the number of coins lost a day is more than amount mined)
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:42:20
Betting 80$ isn't that big of a deal. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:41:18
It can be done but no one would support it
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:28:36
Okay, so it's around a 10% size reduction for average transactions.
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:55:44
Bitcoin has such high fluctuations because it is one of the only major globally traded assets and it has a minuscule market cap compared to every other asset traded it its scale.  Also, even if the US Dollar is a store of value doesn't mean it is a very good one. Keeping money in dollars over a long period of time is ALWAYS a bad move, the only long term store of values in our world is real estate, stocks, and maybe gold.  Bitcoin provides a way for people to store value without having to put their money into risky and expensive assets.  Yes currently it kinda is a shit show, but it just turned 10 years old and it not meant to be the global store of value, just like in 1988 the internet wasn't ready to stream HD video for everyone, but now we have Netflix.  Things take time to mature and markets especially need to grow to get solid liquidity to become stable and to be able to handle everyone having the ability to easily take or put money into it.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:49:14
The coinbase is the first transaction in every block where there is no input but an output to the user who mined the block. This is what mints the new coins into existence. When validating a block it only checks if they didn't create over the limit so some people have made blocks where the coinbase transaction did not give them their full amount that they could of received. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:10:09
Imo there's no reason to talk in bits, it's only relevant to the current price range that will eventually be miniscule in the long run so we should stick to the standard of bitcoins and satoshis. Also bitcoins and Satoshis are the only denominations used in the code. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 09:29:06
And you'd still lose all your money 
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:06:04
You shouldn't be holding your bitcoins on these exchanges, keep them secure in your own wallet 
@_date: 2018-11-05 03:35:50
Yeah but you seem to believe something digital can't have value.  If that's your honest belief there's no reason arguing with someone that doesn't understand basic economic value
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:30:34
Gold has been a solid store of value for centuries not because it has use case but because of its scarcity.  Bitcoin creates something that is even more scarce and is much easier to work with. It's got the scarcity of gold but the usefulness of digital money creating the form of money we've ever had 
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:33:03
It just takes time to implement and code everything and make sure there are no bugs 
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:52:54
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:29:01
I see where they are going with this, but I don't ever see thing being mass adopted, why would I want to go through the hassle of all this when I can just type 0.43 and hit send.  If you want to make a wallet with more privacy it should calculate how to make a transaction more private and do that in the background, not needing the user to know what to do.
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:42:33
The reason they are saying not to use it on main net is not because it's more vulnerable, it's because the routing is not perfect yet and bitcoin can be destroyed if there's a bug. The lightning network is just as secure as using an hot wallet that's why he is saying it's not good for large sums of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:04:27
You can use something like bisq or local bitcoins to be safer 
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:17:11
1) I'd say otherwise, almost every person I know that owns bitcoin does not buy it because they can buy things with it, people buy it because they believe it will appreciate in value.
2) I agree, it will eventually become the world currency, however, in the transition period the market will punish people who spend their bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:40:14
Bitcoin is only 9 years old

The only downside I believe is that you can't put a version number in your block, so this could be a problem if you wanted to vote on an upgrade
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:13:53
This is a limit per node not for the network, also it is extremely unlikely that a node is receiving that many transactions a second to reach that limit

@_date: 2019-09-27 05:50:13
The original "point" or "intent" of bitcoin doesn't matter, the market will find the best use case for it. Imo being trustless is great but will be opt-in, my mom won't be able to manage private keys, run a node, or be able to understand channel liquidity, people like her will most likely only ever use custodial solutions but that's okay. Bitcoin is the soundest money possible and I think the market will value that over everything else.

The chain is only around 150GB, it's over a TB if you store all the intermediate states, but that is not necessary to sync a full node.

Currently, you can do atomic swaps with LTC on LN, so with an interface, you could do a DEX.  If a coin has the same signing algorithm and a malleability fix they should be able to participate in LN.

The price went up more than 20x in a year.  It makes perfect sense that the price crashed this is just how markets work.  We way overshot on what bitcoin was currently worth, we will now undershoot what bitcoin should be currently worth and then we will eventually go back to equilibrium.

The real risk is that it's a hot wallet, so if you're storing your keys on something like your phone or computer, running a lightning node is just as safe, however if you use something like a hardware wallet or a paper wallet, then it isn't as safe.

My real Ah-ha moment of bitcoin was when I renewing my passport.  I had all the money to pay for in cash, but apparently, the US government doesn't accept their own currency so I had to drive 20 minutes to get a bank to BUY a check just so I could give them money the way the wanted.  After that, I really realized how shitty the current banking system is and how much of an upgrade bitcoin is with just it's payment network.

Well in current lightning implementations there are only one way channels, so you'd need 2 channels each with 1btc for a transaction of 1btc to be routed through

It could be worth it but I've already put a lot of money down and I will still be able to buy with my other funds. I am mostly just not saving much money and accumulating as much as I can.

First off blockch technology isn't a thing, blockchain is a buzzword that people use to try and sound smart to scam people. Eth is highly insecure with their "smart contracts", vitalik wanted to add Turing complete scripting to bitcoin but every developer said that it was stupid and too insecure so he went and made his own chain. Eth now suffers from the only contracts actually being used are erc-20 tokens or erc-721 tokens, are which are just ICO scams. Eth has become so insecure even doing multisig isn't safe enough (checkout parity). Eth also suffers from its ridiculous node centralization where creating a full archival node takes around 2TB and is growing at a pace where eventually the chain will be outpacing the time to sync, eventually making it impossible to sync a new fully validating node.

I have 2 big vacations planned this summer and wish I could cancel them just so I could use the funds I have saved to buy more.  Problem is my friends would hate me and I really wanna go.
