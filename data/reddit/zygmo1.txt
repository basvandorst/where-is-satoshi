Absolutely not, you obviously didn't comprehend my statement. If that was in any way my fault I apologize. What I was saying is laughable is the thought of Ecuador developing their own digital currency and thinking in any way that it would be secure, working or in any way reliable.

I use Shapeshift all the time and have nothing but great things to say about them. Every time I've used it has been a wonderful experience. I hope they keep doing what they're doing because they're doing it right!

I've never used Bitfinex before so I didn't have anything tied up in this mess but I can't even imagine losing what I've read that some people have lost today. I've freaked out over thinking I sent half a Bitcoin to the wrong address before so I don't know what I'd be doing right now if I had lost all of mine. I keep mine in cold storage though so I don't have to worry about that fortunately.

Thank you for replying to me that's awesome...The transaction just went through about 20 minutes ago after about 2.5 hours so it's all good now. Is there anything I should do on my end as far as contacting support and canceling my ticket so that they don't waste time on it tomorrow when they get to the office?

I find beer helps more...at least to keep me from panicking any more than I already am.

Shortly after my post earlier I recv'd an email from Emily @ Shapeshift saying that my transaction was cleared. Thank you for you quick reply, it means a lot.

No I've bought from them probably 100X or so but it did finally go through after several hours.

Thanks, that makes me feel better, also good to know about the XPUB.

That's good to know that I can restore to Mycelium if I need to, I wasn't completely sure if I could because I thought Mycelium was a 12 word seed and wasn't sure how that would work.

I read that they have banned Bitcoin and all other digital currencies in a bid to somehow form their own digital currency which is laughable. The Ecuadorian government should've openly promoted and championed Bitcoin if they wanted the economy to improve like they are saying.

Wouldn't it be so easy, as things stand right now, for a government to "persuade" by threat of imprisonment, violence or bribery miners to do their bidding. This would result in irreparable damage to Bitcoin and it would be so easy for a world power to do considering there are-what, maybe 5 main mining groups. This is what scares me the most: the centralization of the mining community and the ease at which something negative could happen because of that.

WTF? Could the issues with Coinbase/GDAX tonight be in any way affecting the price or accounting for the drop?

Yes I've tried on both my Chromebook and also on my pc running Windows 10...At this point I'm just wondering if it's mine that may be defective in some way because everyone else seems to love them. I most likely will go with the Trezor next time if I decide to buy another hardware wallet.

I feel like this would work well until a US warship parked itself beside the island and threatened to blow the shit out of us unless we all board the vessel and leave. If this idea was to really work out in a permanent way we would have to possess the capable defenses. Otherwise we'd all be sitting ducks.

I've used mine on my Chromebook and also on my pc running Windows 10. On both I've encountered the same problems. As of right now it's working perfectly but I'm always scared to send my coins to it due to the fact that most likely at some point tomorrow it'll be showing an error. I would say at least once every couple days it either says "There has been an error with the Ledger API" or will either not fully sync or sync and have balance problems.
