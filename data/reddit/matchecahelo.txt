No idea! Can't find any information online
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:24:38
Such a shame. So sorry for you and your family.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:26:22
There is a small chance that coinbase list Bitcoin Cash in the future and they have said that if that happens, they'll give you the BCC and BTC. I wouldn't count on that though
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:36:17
Who the hell let the bulls out!?!?!
I got in about a month or so ago, and I've been holding and watching my life saving dip about 30% or more... Now we're back, baby!!
Let's get serious now!!
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:55:42
Expect a 30% minimum retrace... The media engine has been super positive recently. When the real drop comes, you'll know it. People will be running. 
Presumably you got in before the China sell off - it'll be like that.
I think we'll go over 10K too, but I think it'll take a bit of time... Late Dec. earliest. Probably Jan or later
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:54:20
yeah, that's what we're all doing in crypto. Look at these ICO's... Projects like EOS. Madness
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:52:48
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:51:19
At 4 million plus a coin, that's a market cap of over 75 trillion... What world do you live in!?!?!
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:10:51
Bitcoin Segwit vs Bitcoin Cash. This is a street fight!
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:20:13
Bro, I seriously wouldn't sell till you know what the score is - That money you got for the S2X token could be all you're left with!
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:08:55
I imagine his response would be for BTC to refer to itself as "Bitcoin Segwit"
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:51:44
The market is being tested at the moment. If we break out of 7,500, that's a strong signal that the bull is still on. If we break down below 7,000 that spells danger.
Altcoins looking good in any case. XMR / ZEC / IOTA / XRP / OMG / VTC / etc etc...
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:38:55
You haven't seen a bitcoin dip yet?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:26:13
Bro, if you think those boomers are stupid enough to give out free money to little twerps, you're dreaming. The "institutional money" is the carrot in front of the HODL'ers faces
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:19:09
Yes of course! You think this just keeps going up?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:23:56
You can't even start to compare it to a stock. It will either explode to the stratosphere or will fall to near zero. The higher it gets, the more of a threat it will be to governments / banks and so expect a fierce war
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:17:07
This is a good point. It seems contradictory that ETC has resiliently made gains in a dip that hip all the other alts
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:59:59
Who are you to decide? It's down to consensus of the users, miners and exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:24:17
First of all, you don't have any of my BTC addresses. Second of all, why the hell are you tipping in BTC and not something like Dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:17:12
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:55:02
ha nice one
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:54:39
To see what the community makes of the market. And yeah it's natural to second guess any move you make when it involves half a year's income... The last time it nearly hit 5K, I was thinking of selling and picking back up on the pullback. I didn't. I takes balls to sell when there is no negative media or FUD being spread in the market. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:10:03
We all need as much luck as we can get in the jungle that is crypto!! So, thanks!!
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:18:52
Not yet... 
I'm bearish in the next month or so but bullish for the next year or two in general. After that, I'm not sure.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:41:15
Anyway, thanks for the referral to bitcoinmarkets - it didn't even know about that subreddit
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:30:42
Hey. I'm just saying that I think that the price right now includes one or two hard fork tokens. When / if a hard fork happens the holders of that coin will have access to two coins. So the price of the legacy coin typically drops because people view the value as the sum of both coins... That's nothing new.
What I think however, is that you're not gona be able to sell these new forks of BTC at the ridiculous highs that BCH got to. Plus, I just think there is too much unbridled optimism in Bitcoin at the moment and a lot of money from the alts came into Bitcoin which may very well flow back.
I just think it's super pumped up at the moment and we'll see sub 5K prices in the next 6 weeks. Anyway, that's just my opinion. If anybody can point me to reasons why that's incorrect, I'd be very greatful! :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:38:02
that would be an epic pullback!
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:40:31
Mate, I'm massively pro bitcoin and blockchain in general. I know all about HODLing... I've weathered the worst of storms. But at the end of the day, most of us are here for a return and in this market, there seems to be a boom and bust every couple of months (obviously with higher highs every time). I've HODL'ed through many of them but after a while, I thought I should start being a bit more active. Selling my BTC was painful as fuck.
If crypto didn't have mad swings, I would keep holding but the more people who do what I plan to do (sell the FOMO and buy the FUD), the smoother the ride will be - that's just arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:27:47
this is the beginning of the FUD train, mate... I would wait till the FUD is outrageous, then go ALL IN... and HODL!
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:37:30
I'm bullish in the long run - I'm just trying to increase my holdings.
The volatility is still massive compared to other asset classes. Very few asset classes drop 9% in one day, especially without massively negative news.
I just find it eery that there's not a tonne of FUD in the market right now with all these hard forks coming up...
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:16:30
I'm happy to wait and see after the S2X fork... If we don't see 5.5 again, then I guess I'll just buy in again in the next big dip, wherever that price point is, haha
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:56:07
look at the media and forums... For the last week or so it's been pure mania... Then the FUD train will start and everybody will be saying that this could be the end of Bitcoin - THAT's the time to buy!
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:09:01
new to this? Show me one BTC all time high that didn't have a pullback...
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:09:21
Still got some other crypto :D
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:38:55
haha. yeah, tell me about it! It's been a painful lesson so far!
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:43:40
That obviously depends on your holdings. You need the question to be more specific. Here's one for you...
If you could invest 1,000 dollars into only one coin, what would it be?
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:14:45
Get out while you can
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:17:30
that's very true, haha!
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:40:55
Only FOMO train allowed in here?
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:16:37
I never claimed that other markets didn't have the same dynamics. In fact the snp is looking a bit too pumped at the moment too
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:58:52
welcome to the jungle mate - that's your decision to make. I wouldn't but everybody lives with the decisions they make... It's trench warfare out here, pal
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:19:31
less than 10 % isn't a proper pullback in Crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:15:45
less than 10 percent isn't a pullback in crypto
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:22:06
haha. I know, I feel naked and vulnerable!
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:12:09
7K tomorrow!!
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:18:55
I know right - Apparently I've gone mad!
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:36:49
It'll very likely test 6K again
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:59:21
Fear Uncertainty and Doubt - To be honest though I do see BTC hitting at the very least 10k... the question is if there will be a correction before that. So buy if you want now, just get ready to HODL 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:58:02
Are you mad? C'mon man, you know it's not gona bull run to 20k without tonnes of pullbacks
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:51:09
wait for the next bear market
