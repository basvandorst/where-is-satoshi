Yea. That's the point. Income increases as money inflates. Always. You will be always fine in your country or rather currency zone. So far Bitcoin hasn't hit anything higher as before, don't forget that. So far there is only a negative trend and WHALES leading the market - sounds familiar, doesn't it? 
Imagine you have invested all of your money in Bitcoin if it's that good and you need to buy a house but BTC is at 5k and you bought at 9k thinking it goes up. Money will most likely always exist in this or another form, but certainly controlled by countries/banks.

Thank you, I suck at terms.

Yea man I remember how I screamed at my grandparents daily because they didn't invest into Microsoft or my parents for not investing into Apple etc.

If you think Bitcoin is a gamble trade in Oil. Every day. You'll learn what heaven and hell really means once you see a 2% change and lose 20% of your money, or make a profit of 20%.

You have to BUY Bitcoin. As long as money is involved a concept of debt is included. The money doesn't create debts, services are.

Now I understand how mad you can be for only having 0.246 BTC in there and something like BitCoin might never happen again where you could have started with a dollar per BitCoin, but hey, you just spend what, 20 hours to gain 2.6k, depending on how it changes.

Try to get rid off "selling" and "buying", it's usually confusing and people tend to misuse them.
For trading, there is opening and closing a position. Opening is when you start, closing is when you stop.
Shorts refer to you betting on a price decrease in hopes of profit. It's pretty much selling the stock without owning it in the first place. Longs refer to you betting on a price increase in hopes of profit. It means you opened it at the current price and hope to close it at a higher price.

False. Noone would buy these softwares if it wouldn't net you a profit. If that would be true, I'd use the shit out of my own software that gives me wins. If it doesn't give any wins, there would be no reason to sell it in the first place, but that also stops me from selling it (take a random guess who would ban such software if it would give wins ;) the ones losing out on it aka the trading platforms). 
It's quite simple: If they would work, noone would sell them. They would use them for themselves to get the profit alone.

You have no choice. You usually get liquified automatically once you run out of money for the short/long to keep it. If you would ever go negative on your account, you have all of your details given. For me, as example, I had to give them my ID and all bits of information about me. Enough to get back any money I would owe them.
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:18:18
My mistake, let me restate the meaning: income increases when money inflates and prices decrease corresponding to that. Otherwise if that wasn't true then you could only purchase 3% of what you could purchase before which would make something simple as a restaurant visit more expensive as travelling. 
Please don't start with limited markets now, like rent and houses. At a time where everyone could build anywhere and space was not limited the prices were low. 
And again, you completly ignore any point I make as to how BTC has similar or even worse issues.
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:13:19
Bitcoin is in that regard not different.

I honestly don't want to live in a world where the market is controlled by whales and I won't know for the next day if I have 500k in my bank or 5k.
I see BitCoin as a great addition to normal money, but the normal money can't be gone. Exploits are way to easy. Imagine whales pull out all of their money right before summer, making people pay way more? They would really control the prices as hell, and we don't talk about only a 2-3 times increase.
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:00:23
You didn't get the point I was making repeatedly when I said " while money has a consistent value in your country"
First of all, BitCoin is just converted into FIAT as well and it's value is depending on that. So no matter what loss USD has, BitCoin has it aswell. 
Secondly, taking your number of 97% I'd assume someone that pays with USD can barely buy anything, right? I mean if you have anything with value and it loses 97% of it's value, you would need to pay a shit ton (ignoring market changes that might also increase/lower how much you have to pay) to even buy basic things. I mean to put it into words and to show how your comment has no meaning: 
The value of USD according to you decreased by 33 times. Now - does it matter? Again, no. That was my point. Whatever country you live in, you will get paid to keep the economy going, so no matter how badly the value or the exchange rate of your currency is going down, it doesn't matter. Perfect example for this is Africa. Most of their currencies suck compared to USD/Euro/anything, yet it doesn't matter FOR THEM, because they get paid in the value they need.
Now you could argue that you don't just have a single currency and that makes hard cash bad, but...isn't the same thing the case for cryptocurrency? How many thousands to exist meanwhile? 
With hard cash, the problem is that banks control everything. With Crypto Currency the problem is that rich people control everything. Since rich people usually also control banks to a certain degree, they are not very different. Just imagine a bunch of whales decide to move out all of their BitCoins (I mean as in value), lowering the price by a ton, as soon as it turns summer and people want to go on vacation. Suddenly you have to pay a turn for that, just because they decided to do it. 
A currency that can change by 30% within a day, even more, is not a stable currency anyone could rely on. I mean you could safe up most of your life and suddenly it's worth nothing. You need something desperately? Maybe even pay important bills, buy life saving machines? Well, sucks for you, the value just went down by 20%. Let's just wait a day, will surely go up again and you have SOME time, well sucks more, another 30%. You wait further and it stays still. You are forced to pay because you need it for your living. Maybe to pay your rent. Whatever it is. And it's gone. You suddenly lost 10% of your BitCoins at aroundish half of their value.
Don't you see that problem with it?
I am all in for Crypto Currency, trust me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here, otherwise I wouldn't invest in it, but I get scared by the blind followship Crypto Currencies have, that some people don't think and just believe.

Noone said that. Even though too high income does exactly that.


False, and simple thinking should tell you that. If your statements were true then business prices went up by around 30x while money inflated by 97% (according to you), so in total 900 times more price to pay. Don't you realize what you say makes no sense?
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:16:19
It's the same with every single robot that claims that he can invest for you efficiently and give you a profit - IF that was the case, then noone would ever said robot/program and simply use it for themselves. Don't be retarded, people.

"bitcoin is gonna be 100k in 2 years"
Be optimistic, but realistic. I hope for high tops, but that's the same thing people said in 2017. It can always be different, but that also includes worse.
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:09:55
Tell that to people that bought at 13.5k
Inflation is such a fun story used by people to talk bad about money. Don't get me wrong, I invest in Bitcoin just as in many other stocks, but if inflation would exist in the way it's portrayed countries would stop to exist.
Inflation is only bad outside of the country and happens everywhere.

You don't have to buy anything in life. You could just go bare minimum and drink tapping water and eat rice all month long. Yet people who had enough money get into debt up to their own bad choices. 
And Bitcoin in that regard is even worse - while money has a consistent value in your country, you never know how much you could buy or rather lose when you buy with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:06:16
If you want to make decent shorttime profit and understand the market Bitcoin is not what you need but Oil.
Bitcoin is rather intended for the future, even though I am not convinced it will hold it's position. Currently it's value doesn't differ at all from any other currency that exists in the world and as long as "normal" currencies exist it's value is based on those currencies. 
Every shop that accepts BTC has to set prices based on its exchange rate - just like any other currency. Its controlled by a small amount of very rich people - just like any other currency. 
I view some parts of BTC as new future currency, but if you can't even tell if you gonna pay 4 times for upcoming Christmas presents or just 1/4 makes it very unreliable.

I don't plan to sell, because it hurts losing money. Then again it hurts losing even more money, but the more people sell, the more it will drop, so holding up strong!
