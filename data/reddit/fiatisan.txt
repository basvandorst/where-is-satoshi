Depositors should simply withdraw their credits from this bank in cash, and watch how fast Lakestone Bank reverses its tune when facing a run. 
Lakestone Bank &amp; Trust's balance sheet:

No, but wouldn't a more apt insult reference a date pre 1933?
That statement is actually from J.P. Morgan's testimony before Congress in 1912:

Don't rely on governments to protect you. Under the guise of "protecting consumers", government regulations are simply a set of rules that banks themselves create to decrease competition. Remember that no regulatory agency accurately foretold the downturn in 2008. (Austrian Business Cycle Theory most accurately explains why the boom/bust cycle occurs).
(At the expense of sounding pedantic is important to point out that every bank in a fractional reserve system is technically insolvent. Its simply the fact that not all customers will redeem their credits at once. If they did, the bank would not be able to honor those obligations.)
Even if a bank is not engaging in speculation or underwriting toxic mortgages, it
can easily become insolvent by investing in what would appear to be sound AAA rated securities, as was the case for many smaller banks who were sold toxic mortgage bonds by Goldman and the like. They did not underwrite these loans directly.
First I would implore you to question whether it responsible to store your wealth in Federal Reserve Notes or any other fiat currency. By doing so, you implicitly subsidize UNLIMITED government deficit spending, which ultimately means you're paying to drone striking kids in Syria. Fiat currency is the primary mechanism by which major conflicts are financed today. Absent a populace willing to hold their wealth in fiat, the world will know peace.

Being a professional bean counter in no way makes a false statement true. 
For the record, deposits are a general obligation of the bank. That is, you are a creditor. It is not "your money". Banks do not retain deposits and loan them to new customers. In a fractional reserve banking system they issue new credits to your account when a loan is created, and charge you interest for this numeric database entry.  Banks do not hold YOUR currency in reserve waiting until you come to claim it. Less than 3% of all Federal Reserve bank credits are held in physical note form (cash).
If it really was customer's "money" (side note: money is gold, not credit) then every customer would be able to redeem their balance on demand, which is simply not possible - hence the true fraud of fractional reserve banking. 
In case you'd like more information on the topic:

Thank you. I couldn't agree more!

I believe cryptocurrency is that revolution.

Speaking of balance sheet, for anyone who is a current creditor (aka depositor) of this bank:  
Given the fraudulent nature of their business model, the minimum level of withdrawals before Lakestone faces a serious run is quite low. 
Rough napkin math suggests they're incapable of redeeming more than 2.1% of deposits before they begin liquidating securities.

Federal Reserve Notes*. The Treasury issues debt at interest, in exchange for credits to the Treasury's account at the Federal Reserve.

For hating Roger Ver so much, the bitcoin core community really does have a lot of confidence in his ability to influence the market. 
Trying to suggest that any fluctuation in a very volatile asset class is directly attributable to Roger sounds quite foolish.

Ben Lawsky is a criminal. That piece of shit was New York's first Superintendent of Financial Services, a position created in 2011. He wrote legislation called the "BitLicense", which made it impossible for bitcoin businesses to operate in New York. He left in 2015 to open a consulting firm TO CHARGE MONEY BY "HELPING" FIRMS NAVIGATE THE LAWS HE WROTE.  When the mob does that shit its called extortion. When Ben Lawsky does it, its called the BitLicense. BEN LAWSKY IS AN EXTORTION ARTIST. Fuck him right in the pussy.
