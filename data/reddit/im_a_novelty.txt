Fair. I was thinking from a sense of:
* I bought 1 $100 BTC, it shoots up to $500 (using post-tax money I earned)
* I buy a $500 item using BTC (Sales tax, as normal)
* I have to pay a ($400 - fees) Short-Term Capital Gains tax
"Normal" transactions would be using $500 post-tax dollars. Which I suppose would be less in the longer-run...
Yes. I can easily see how the accounting for this is a little tedious.

Shoot. I meant TryBTC.com. This is what I get for tapping out a post in a taxi.

Yup. Running through some examples makes more sense. I was thinking about a $100 BTC sold for $100 and somehow capital gains were in there. However, this is not the case since it was there were no gains.

Ah, yes. You're right. I forgot that if the price doesn't increase, there are no gains to consider.
Makes sense. Thanks!

I've just gotten started with actually using Bitcoins (bought .25 today through Coinbase; added a $5 USD tip to my website in Bitcoins) and I'm suddenly feeling like it's gotten super mainstream.
Well, we'll see how things pan out. Definitely a conversation-worthy topic.

I might for the short-term. However, shareholders tend to make companies think quarter to quarter rather than longer term.

I am very glad I don't turn ~~off~~ on AdBlock on Reddit. I've been meaning to get into Bitcoins, and now I have people I can ask stupid questions! :)

"I have to see you" [when handing you a dollar]
Uh, no. Have you not seen Breaking Bad?

I can't tell if you're giving him support or making fun of him...
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:16:53
Yes, but I mean if you buy gas with BTC, you're going to be TRIPLE taxed. That's no fun.
