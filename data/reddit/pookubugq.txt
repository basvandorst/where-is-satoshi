Fees suck right now. Just no way around it. I’m using Litecoin as much as possible for transactions until Lightning gets going. What I would pay in BTC fees will be worth a lot more next year. ��

I agree that no future is guaranteed, but to act like Bitcoin can be manipulated to nothing by millions with billions at stake is crazy.
Not sure why you are hostile towards holding - or perhaps it is the HODL meme you take issue with.
I’m not worried about Bitcoin. If you are, sell yours off. I’m good.

That was from Dec. 27. Guessing there wasn’t a giant sell off of all the BCH on Coinbase in Jan.
Did those on here sell there BCH or HODL?

People are looking at the penny stocks of crypto at the moment. When that bubble pops, people will consolidate that new 400 billion market cap in alts back into BTC. Get ready for $30K+.

The crypto world is the most conspiracy driven community I’ve ever seen. Guys - do you know what it would take to make BCash replace Bitcoin? More than a little marketing FUD. Every Exchange - all of them - would need to convert to BCash simultaneously as the currency all other currencies trade against. If one did it, all the users would jump ship to another exchange.
It ain’t happening.
The .com and Twitter handle are not going to dethrone the great one.
Chill out and let these altcoins have their day in the sun. Make a little money off of them if you can. Then go back to HODLing the behemoth that is BITCOIN!

Roger Ver has made some hasty statements, because of his short temper. That, I don’t really mind even though those are the clips people share to discredit him. He is passionate, but not great under pressure.
I do care about the lying. Own your mistakes and move on.
The BCash confusion he is creating is also making me like him less and less. BCash has potential to flourish as one of the top altcoins. It also made a lot of Bitcoin holders a lot of money. Run with that rather than trying to bite the hand that feeds you.

The big boys are fine (expecting a correction on ETH though).
I’m talking about MoonCoin, ReddCoin, Electreum, Tron, Verge, etc. The little guys that made money for a lot of 3+ month holders in the last few weeks. A lot of people investing hoping for the same return.

People don’t understand what it means to leave a legacy. It’s not about giving someone a life of luxury, it’s about giving people security. Most “wealthy” people don’t have Hilton or Gates money, they just use money to make money over time. If you are smart that can continue for generations.

I’m not sure what is considered a high fee, but I just transferred outta Coinbase last night to a Trezor.
$100 worth for $3.92 as a test (first Trezor). Showed as unconfirmed immediately. Took less than 10 minutes to confirm.
Sent a lot more for... wait for it.... $3.93. Less than 10 minutes to confirm.
Worked like a champ and fees seemed fine to me.
