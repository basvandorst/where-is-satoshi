I remember when around year ago this thread was full of enthusiasts screaming FOMO and FUD around every corner but now it just feels like a bunch of depressed children, patting eachother on the back. Your pretense is really too big, it will take at least another year or two before we can get any confirmation.

I am not even going to comment on this, I commented couple of times on got reddit, it's pitiful that you cannot grasp the difference between me and yourself who came here in the light of recent ATH apparently hoping to kid yourself and "get rich fast". Then suffered couple market cycles and pissed himself already. I believe your ilk isn't of the sort that I'd go as far as to study your entire comment history, who would be so petty lulzzz thus au revoir, many lambo.
Also don't act as if you understand the tech and watched a singly lecture on it, because you simply don't. You already kid yourself twice, three times would be nothing short of pathetic &gt;;(

Well, I am buying at 6k 100%, even if it doesnt rally up much, I am sure it will bounce back enough to make neat profit short-term.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:12:10

@_date: 2018-03-10 16:33:59
investing in altcoin you pretty much assume 2 things
1) BTC will have strong bull run
2) THAT alt coin will have strong bull run as they are connected
so pretty much if currently there is very high risk regarding those, if you invest in alts you double already high risk into extremely high risk lul

In truth, we could drop to like 5.5k and then bounce back to 9k and then drop even lower in a scale of entire bear market, until it dropped low enough for many enough people to step in..
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:55:17
you are dumb, why would they want to crash the price, many people are waiting to dig in at 5.5k range wouldnt it better for a whale to help a price little bit and make another run at 10k and THEN crash the price back? That seems more like it.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:12:16

Patience. Don't fall to emotions, follow strict plan. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:48:43
It's a threshold that it's difficult for price to breach, think of it as a barrier price. There are many points of resistance and points of support. Whenever resistance breaks, it automatically becomes support and reverse. 
Imagine it like this, for an instance there is a situation where price is going up nicely but there is fuckton of guys that want to cash out and make a profit on like~~ 13k level. So they will all place sell orders that will create a resistance line for the buyers that need to "outbuy" them and more to cross it for the price to continue going up. Otherwise price bounces back, obviously it could also float there for a while et cetera.
This is the most simplistic explanation, anyways, for bitcoin there are couple more special levels than the others, you need to look at the history chart to see when price struggled the most to decide its worth. For bitcoin the most important point is 12k level, because it'd give technical evidence that bear trend was reversed and many people would step in, resulting in the price going to atleast 13k and probably even 14.2k but then there are many barriers to pass on the way so no one can know for sure.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:12:53
Hey, remember...3 days ago...it was at 9800...and then dropped to 8100...short memory short, why was it...ah yes it bounced off the resistance....where are we...ah below 8.6 resistance...oh shiii 
I really wish atleast half of the people commenting there were capable of BASIC chart analysis. Guess that's impossible due to the fact that most of the people commenting here watch crypto 6 weeks at best and never traded a single penny before :D
Look lad, I don't say you are mistaken, it could happen, but probability of that happening is rather unlikely boo given we are ballsdeep in bear field
If you are shorting, you have bought below 8k and will sell now or very soon, if you think this is a sign for FOMO and  MOONGDSGEsdrt then...lul

@_date: 2018-03-17 13:34:49
I like them, they came to BTC on the bear market, and leave in the middle(or beginning) of bear market.
It's adorable how one wants to trade without knowledge of basic terms like BULL AND BEAR jesus christ, it's like a baby pacifier for a kid. BTC has been in a bear market for 3 months now, EVEN when it was at 11700 IT WAS a bear market, there was a rally that - failed to recover eventually, deal with it lol. Smart investors sold long ago(the ones that bought on the way up to 11.7)

This thread really has become a place where nooblets who bought v.high without seeing BTC chart before want to fomo other nooblets who dont know what BTC even is, so that they dont get stuck on high price.
On the oppposite end, there are also many nooblets who want to FUD other nooblets into mass selloff, because they are poor mcdonald workers and dont have money to realistically invest when price is relatively high.
To be quite frank with you, I come here for fun and daily troll. Please writhe some more for my entertainment.

so how much did you lose
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:04:03
its not sign of the bull, it only means it bounced and reversed short-term, sign of the bull would be if it had broken past 12k or atleast 11.8. It's bear market all along.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:29:18
Fake buy walls are real though

@_date: 2018-03-07 20:20:13
You shouldn't indulge in trading if you are stupid as fuck like this.
Do you even realise how much would need to happen for price to plummet this much within 24hour range. I don't say it's impossible but this is your ass talking.
This thread is always so funny, everytime bitcoin goes up everyone screams MOONNNFDGREGSd and when it corrects everyone says it will drop to new bottom just lol at you guys, how can you be doing this if you are so feeble minded.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:43:39
I am sure people like you once it'd possibly gone down to 3k would start saying "$3k is just a small stop next is 200$" or something like this.
If you don't have money why even kid yourself...OnionKing...
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:01:29
lol, you are a fool, everyone knew correction would take time, so smart traders went on vacation with the profits they made in december
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:52:38
You are a thorough man, indeed next couple of hours will tell us a lot, whether he continues to sell, if he does then so the dip goes on.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:23:46
smaller fees, more accurate live price, you can make limit orders and stop orders generally way more convienient.
also you can use your coinbase account with gdax, just requires more thorough verification, so why use coinbase if you can gdax?
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:33:47
i dont get it why people buy at this level, its heading to 6k and we shall put up a fight there lul
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:16:49
They would not be here, because they are not opportunists, most of the people here came recently to 'get rich fast" without trading single thing in their lives before and with 0 knowledge whatsoever about it
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:17:03
dab can you just fuck off already lol, everyone knows here by now that you bought high close to 11k and now you try to fomo every noob here to trash their money just because you bought bad position
yikes, so cringy

@_date: 2018-03-18 05:01:13
It's gonna be way faster than that. We will see 6k Before end of next week, then we will see a bounce back and depending on the volume and momentum we may see a some bull or not
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:02:46
or he will feel edgy and decide to crash a market dumping 50k BTC lul
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:52:41
I think there was some around 7.5k but the one at 6k-5.5k is big deal.

@_date: 2018-03-06 19:40:50
Don't be a fool, if it jumps back again to retest 12k, it's gonna reach atleast 11.5-6, selling at raw 11k is outright stupid. Also notice that if it breaks 11.8 then we may be on the way to 13k by the charts that is, so there is always that, gotta observe when its getting close.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:22:08
Absolutely, it will drop even lower, Sell now, buy lower for more, multiply holdings. It is a no brainer at this point will drop to atleast around 6k.
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:46:45
You should have waited for  7p.m EST,  we get selloffs every day exactly at this hour.
Anyways, guys I think the whale trying to lock price down now is actually doing good for the BTC in the longterm. If it had blown off again very high, people would get in heat again and it'd spread more widely and technology just isnt ready yet for that. There are many problems so whoever that whale is, be it trustee or bobdoe, he isnt doing it out of malice. This is rather a directed action to s a v e the bitcoin from premature ejaculation...so to speak :D
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:27:13
Skynet is nigh
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:09:53
Possible, I thought of that month ago. Even so, I am probably gonna buy my position at 8k.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:18:59
go outside, get some fresh air, stop staring at charts whole day, when its bear market you go make cool things instead of sitting there
I guarantee you, it will reach atleast 6k range before it bounces back considerably so go have a good one.
If not you may wait for 7.4k~~~range there might be some resistance and some bounce, everything below stops at 6k. After 6k there is 5.5k etc
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:41:45
lol, you already made your position before, now you are trying to fomo people come on, as if anyone would care about shit being posted there :D
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:19:27
what the fuck are you talking about dude, have you been attending primary school maths, it appears not
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:53:22
Apparently I was right, what follows now is the testing of 9.3k threshodl, should 9.3k fall the next target will be around 8.6k so watch out now. If we continue dropping past that we may even hit new bottom C: Honestly it's iffy whether MtGox case can sustain so much selling that it'd crash it so hard. Definitely a number of people will back off now though, so rally back looks grim.
//EDIT So apparently we broke through 9.3k, welcome 8.6k bitcoin, better than drugs indeed.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:33:04
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:28:41
better than drugs lol
why drugs if you can bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:33:08
S4nie, if you buy it at 9.3k level where was strong resistance last time you shouldn't be at much loss, even though it could potentially go below 9k-8k range(obviously there is a possibly we could be headed to lower bottom when the last one we had, but probly the guys from the rally back then are strong hodlers so we wont drop below 8k so making position at low 9k is most likely least risky) The probability of it jumping back and trying to retest 12k is greatly more likely than for it to going down to 8k or even lower, there just isn't enough selling volume for this shit.
Also don't forget to observe 10.2-1k level, there will be a resistance holding there and this one will decide whether it goes down to 9.5~~ range for the time being.
Personal advice even though I, myself am still fresh at this~~ PATIENCE and firm grip on your plan. You should analyze charts yourself and do some research though, in the end no one fucking knows.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:12:27

My gut feeling is that there is no feeling at all.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:15:44
I dont care really, I am gonna make position at around 6k~~ roughly anyways, It's hard for me to imagine that it'd drop below 5k much anyways. Double 6k bottom scenario seems like a way to go.

If you sell it's transfered to your fiat coinbase wallet from which you can withdrawn your funds to your bank, and yeah you will be able to purchase coins with coinbase wallet instantly as you make order.
But don't use coinbase though, GDAX is certainly more prominent and it's a twin.
