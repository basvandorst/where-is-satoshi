I don't know about ledger. My ledger is arriving in March. I tried a small amount to Electrum and it took about 30 minutes to fully clear. Maybe because of segwit address?
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:51:42
Up to certain amount I believe. I just don't want her to get into any problems.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:25:29
When can we expect the price to rise? What do we know from previous dips?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:47:59
What do I put as my basis price if granny brought multiple times then transferred them all together?
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:42:14
Let's all ask gemini to verify my account. Please...I'm begging. 12/22/17 to present.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:45:17
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:34:06
Please give me some please sir please
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:16:42
I'm i wanna buy more now and I have no fiat :-'(
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:52:17
I wish they had ACH transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:10:20
Instant. If you want to transfer to gdax, log in to GDAX first then deposit from coinbase. It's instant.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:56:34
I'm surprised world largest exchanges only has wire transfer. Why not give the users credit and ACH options. Wire from chase cost me extra $40. Fk that.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:34:39
I've been waiting to get verified on gemini for over 2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:05:31
Credit and debit are same I believe. I saw $10 fee plus additional $18 cash advance fee on my statement.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:41:14
Add more exchanges. I use gemini, I would like to know the price on the exchanges I use. I would work on the UI a bit more.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:43:30
Can you get a petition started for better customer service? At least answer our email within 1 week time?
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:01:30
Any news on when other states will be added? Saying soon doesn't help me with sleep.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:20:41
How long did it take to verify for tier 3? All exchanges are batshit when I visit their subreddit. Which exchange has good customer support?
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:35:06
No Android?
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:31:42
You also get charge cash advance fee if you use your credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:27:14
My deposit is still pending after 6 days...wtfffffff.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:56
3 weeks old and still learning. Not freaking out. People need to understand what *investing* is before dumping their money into cryptocurenncy or even in the stock market.  Just don't be an idiot and invest what you can't afford to lose. Thats the first thing I've learned. I'm buying more once gdax/ coinbase approve my deposit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:25:19
Is it like gdax? No fees to limit buy or sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:12:22
I brought in at 19.5k. Just ~~hold~~ HODL man.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:47:29
I'm locked out if coinbase and gdax. How am I suppose to get my transaction information?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:14:23
I do plan on selling it when it reaches certain price and buy again when it dips, but no plan on cashing out. I think I need to really understand this bullshit tax rules before tax season comes.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:09:55
My friend sold out at 14800. He reintroduced me to bitcoin 3 weeks ago. I took a loss buying at 19.5k, but hodl it and brought more and just gained over $150 as today. I'm dreaming 18k by the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:22:52
Man I keep regretting not buying in 2011. I knew about bitcoin from the dark web. I thought it was just some made up currency people on the dark web using to sell stuff. Fk me and now 3 week ago my friend introduced me to it...
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:02:05
So if I have BTC on GDAX and it's just sit there and I have no intention to sell and cash out until my desire price hits 50k. Do I NEED to report to the  IRS?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:32:58
Sweet!!!! My money already left the bank. It's just pending on coinbase...or the opposite...don't know.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:26:51
Fucking coinbase wouldn't deposit my money until 2 hours ago. I could've brought in at 12k.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:36:17
If I want to transfer my coins back to coinbase or gdax can I do that for free? Or do I have to pay fee?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:33:48
Please don't watch dip and buy. It can wait. Leave it to the professional. Drive safe. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:44:29
HODL on tight! It's going to be a bumpy ride. Rear shock just went out.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:06:32
Hahaha I wish. I got a android tablet setup with hotspot.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:50:28
Can you explain this like I'm 5? Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:25:25
I can get a lambo then with all the dips I'm buying :-D
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:02:36
I buy dips. I got multiple buy order setup. If it get closer to fulfil I cancel if and set a new buy order. Usually the 2nd is satifies me. I got 1 setup at $8000.00. I'm a HoDleh I brought in at $19.5k imagine how many hair I pulled off my head. A lot.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:24:22
I used to, but not anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:07:31
Just an android tablet.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:11:19
My money grow tree.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:48:17
Hold til I retire.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:51:27
I try not to check the price after I buy.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:47:04
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:45:25
I wish I wasn't skeptical back In 2010 when i first heard about it. Plus I was too afraid to buy it from the dark web. Life went on and I forgot all about til 2017. Fock.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:57:58
I'm broke. Today was my last purchase. Let's hope it slowly rise to the moon in 2019.
