Haha quite the reddit comment there. Blasting people in a condescending way and you have no idea what you are talking about.

Ha! I hope you realized that song is about Indiana small towns too!

It was really fast. I think a lot of people had buys set in and it bounced back really fast.

Implement SegWit and/or lightning network. Ask coinbase to do it today!!! They are holding it back for their own gains.

I took this whole course and it really helped me understand blockchain technology on a really deep level. The professors are insanely knowledgeable. I can’t recommend this course enough!!!

Generally speaking this might help you understand.

I took all these and they are amazing. It’s on Coursera and totally free. I feel like I understand crypto on such a deeper level now instead of people telling me what news or comments from people mean I know what they mean. Protects me from over hype and FUD.

It’s not going to be a one coin wins all system. The problem is there are a lot of coins that are all hype (Tron) or scams (bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv). 
Buy bitcoin and learn for now. Then when you find something that has actual value and not a group of people telling you it has value or making up what this coin could maybe do buy some of that. 
Just learn. Andreas Antonopoulos is a good starting point.

So the federal government knows who he/she is then?

What’s up with the volume though?

Ah yeah, but I think it’s smart to not talk about how much you have on the internet. People can link things so easily now.
