Bitcoin has been forked before. The new forked blockchain, called Bitcoin Cash, *is* Bitcoin. It's the blockchain Satoshi intended when he created Bitcoin. It's the Bitcoin I bought at 0.05 unadulterated by "SegWit" or "Lightning" nonsense. (Honestly, I don't know why you folks don't buy Litecoin and leave us Bitcoin folk alone.) And when the price of BTC crashes, it will be called "Bitcoin" again. 
But I know this sub is run by Blockstream so remove my post and ban me, cowards.

Can't tell you when to get in but prices have dropped a lot on Fridays recently. There might be opportunities tomorrow. I suspect the price will get near or slightly above $3000 and then people will take their profits before the weekend. 
I've been reading this guy lately. He seems to offer good advice:

I thought it was miners mining more than 80% of the BTC in the world.

Your reason not to use Coinbase is that they're paying too much to move their customers money quickly? What?

What's the price of PayCoin to cigarettes?
