It was obvious for anyone paying attention to Mt. Gox since forever, they've fucked up so many times anyone who stuck with them should be embarrassed by their idiocy.  If Mt. Gox somehow gets through this latest fuck up people will still use them and they will fuck up yet again and everyone will act shocked.  Even George Bush would have gotten the hint months ago, can't fool him.

Why?  I still got all my coins.  Oh you mean those fucking idiots who never listened to good advice, yeah lets laugh at them.  Ha-Ha!  Seriously though, stupid people, when the majority of people tell you you're being stupid, stop being stupid.  That's all.

Technology can spread quite rapidly but I think 5-10 years is more realistic but anything can happen.

He did receive a few paper cuts from those strongly worded letters, that makes stealing all that money almost not worth it.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:37:54
I might have a couple.
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:12:58
I think the problem is some information needed to track them is unknown and because Karpeles stole the coins he'll never release that info so he can keep and spend them without fear of being caught.  If you want to find the coins you'll have to kidnap him and break him.  He looks like he'd break quite easily.

@_date: 2014-06-27 10:41:12
Seriously, the only reason for him not to show us is if he stole the coins himself.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:23:18
Prove it.

No, maybe end of next year.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:16:17
Bitcoin seems to attract all the pond scum in the world, scams like these will only continue because it is easier to steal peoples money than to actually work and make the business succeed.  What a shame.  It's also mostly stealing from nerds and these scam artists know they don't have the guts to do anything but bitch and moan.
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:31:14
Well technology is not his expertise so he can be excused but he really shouldn't try talk with authority on something that is beyond his understanding.

If you don't need to sell then just rent it out, that way if things don't work out in the Philippines for whatever reason or you get homesick you have your nice home just waiting there for you.

Well if you recover the coins you just keep the bounty and send him back the rest.

So there really are only 200000 coins that are unaccounted for, what will happen to the ~624000 that are still in known Gox address?

Give people money and the majority of them will spend it.

Either your computer is infected or someone you know went on your computer last night and stole your coins.  You were targeted so someone probably fond out about them, either in real life or online in some forum or on reddit.  Go back in time and you'll find the mistake you made.  Do you keep the wallets encrypted?
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:20:54
Why did you bother to block out your bitcoin amount?  We all know it's gone now.

Maybe in a few decades but not anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:05:47
Just myself, though many now at least pay closer attention to bitcoin even if it is just to bring up any negative news.

One of my most favorite books.
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:52:41
Whoever took the coins knew they were there in the first place, so the victim probably told people about how many coins he had and somebody got jealous.  The attacker might have even had physical access to the guys computer or sent him a new version of angry birds.  The guy definitely knows who took his money he's just too stupid to realize it.
@_date: 2011-06-21 10:57:17
I think it is highly probably that this person was involved and is now trying to make himself seem like a victim to avoid prison.  I'd like to see this guy offer up his tech for forensic analysis, the we'll see what he's actually been up to.

It's always around the time these posts start coming out that bitcoin crashes and burns.  I expect it to crash back to around $700 per coin fairly soon but impossible to know anything for certain.  Which is why you should never make these kinds of bets.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:10:56
Fuck these assholes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:46:04
This is not good for Bitcoin, for it to be so easily manipulated causing such chaos is a serious problem.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:03:48
I think regardless of whether it was a DDoS attack or not they are not ready for so much publicity and should get their shit together and build some serious infrastructure.  I'm thinking about doing something in my country over the next year or so but doing it right.  People want to rush in unprepared and it only leads to headaches.  I have time so I will take my time and try build something solid.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:36:53
That's awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:51:41
Why would I buy coins during massive price swings?  I can't buy right now even if I wanted to because my so called exchange has paused all trades.  I want Bitcoin to succeed and will hold onto my coins for years but I won't buy any more until I see things settle down.  I want to see how Bitcoin handles all this chaos, that will tell me more about whether it will succeed or not.  I don't want to use them as an investment but be able to use them to buy things and send money around the globe with ease.  Right now I can't use Bitcoins in my home country and can barely buy or sell them so I'll just wait.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:03:07
If they use a service like BitPay they don't have to be concerned about the volatility, they get their dollar value of the product when the person buys it.

Can't they just set a minimum of say $10 to make it more difficult for people to do this? At least temporarily.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:27:17
Bitcoin needs to be able to survive attacks like this relatively unscathed, if it can't then it must fail and a new system that can must be created.  We need a digital currency that can be a dominant force, it shouldn't matter if that means a few rules are put in place to prevent the morons and assholes from fucking everyone over.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:44:25
So what's your point?  He wants to find out who is behind the attack not find and punish the computers the attacker controls.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:13:43
It won't be high for long, most of the people attracted by the frenzy have left with what they could salvage.  Now we are left with the people still in disbelief that they lost their entire fortune and are hoping by some miracle they get it back.  Gradually they will come to the realization that they fucked up and will sell while they can.  It will take a few days but it will drop and drop and drop till only the core users are left then who knows what will happen.

You're awesome, looking at your comment history you don't fuck around.  It would be nice to hear how you got into bitcoin and where you see it going.  I've been thinking a lot about the possibilities and it is exciting.  I expect in maybe ten years time digital currency will be the dominant currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:39:51
When they are shipping and actually working then yes the difficulty will rise so much that GPU mining won't be worth the time.  People would have to then calculate how profitable these new ASIC rigs are given the difficulty rise and make a choice as to whether they are worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:36:28
Yeah it sucks but nobody should jump head first into things they don't understand while ignoring all the solid advice people were giving them.  They should have just dipped their toe in first, played around for a few months while learning from everyone around them before taking things further little by little.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:36:20
As long as just one of us can affect the worth of Bitcoin so dramatically and with such ease it will be essentially worthless.  Smart people need to solve this problem or Bitcoin will fail.  I believe in the idea of a digital currency but it is too early to tell if Bitcoin can be the digital currency everyone uses.  It will take a few years but it can be done, we just need smart dedicated people to make it happen.  I won't give up on the idea and will help in anyway I can.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:48:08
By the time you get it, if you get, the difficulty will be so high it might not be worth it.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:25:30
A stable Bitcoin the majority of people can be confident in is years off.  It is going to be an incredible challenge so don't get prematurely excited, focus your energy on helping the community solve the problems that are destroying confidence in Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:27:44
Well if you listened to what most people here are saying you would never have invested more than you could afford to lose.  I'm in this for the long run, I can see the potential and I will continue to buy little chunks now and then.  I'm not going to invest large sums of money, just small amounts each month so if this experiment fails it doesn't affect me.  I'm looking five years down the line.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:01:32
It is going to be a long difficult journey and we must not give up on this idea because it can change the world for the better.  People need to stop saying everything will be fine because it won't if everyone just waits for problems to fix themselves.  Put your thinking caps on and get to work you lazy bastards.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:47:50
Best guess is not for many months to over a year, the infrastructure/market is not there yet to support and justify another massive rise and all the chaos that comes with it.  It may never rise as long as it can be so easily manipulated.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:58:17
Eventually yes but most likely not for a while.  It's too crazy to predict right now.

Obvious troll.  Bitcoins could very well likely be worthless in the coming weeks and could take months or years to go past $66 again if ever.  It's impossible to know for sure so if you really did risk everything on a guess you're a fucking retard and deserve to lose it all including your girlfriend.  People don't like to live in the gutter.

@_date: 2013-04-11 11:50:59
Just buy some coins with the money and wait until you can buy one of these ASIC rigs and have it shipped to you within a few days.  Once that is possible there will be so many of them the difficulty will sky rocket and you will have to calculate if they are still worth it.  Right now you would be last in line to get yours when they do start shipping so you could be waiting for many months to well over a year.  Stay clear.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:23:37
With regards to bitcoin and any service related to bitcoin, if you don't know who is behind the product then just walk away.  Trusting someone that refuses to put their real name behind their product is just idiotic.  Then if you do get scammed at least you know the fucker who took your money.

In let's say ten years time billions of people on the planet will be using digital currency.  It is inevitable and the logical next step.  Now lets assume Bitcoins survive to be that dominant digital currency.  Billions of people sharing less than 21 million coins, now how much will each of those coins have to be worth?  
Try to imagine the convenience a digital currency will afford you in everyday life and how it will remedy the current inconveniences you are forced to suffer.  Your mobile phone could become your entire financial system that you can take with you anywhere on the planet.  
Look how the internet was this strange thing once that people thought would not amount to anything and now it is something we can't possibly live without.  Technology is taking over every aspect of our lives at an ever increasing pace so why not our money?
Digital currency will follow the same path as the internet, it will seem strange and people will think nothing will come of it but eventually everyone will experience it.  They will get used to it, then rely on it and eventually they won't be able to function without it.
