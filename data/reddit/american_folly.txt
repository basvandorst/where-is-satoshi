AFAIK 2-factor authorization is only available for transfers out of the exchange. I was using 2 factor, but apparently it is not necessary for email address changes (either that or my email account was compromised as well, changed all passwords just in case). So given that the email address linked to my account was changed I don't get the authorization emails regardless.

Well *something* fishy is definitely going on! My regular account was hijacked about 6 hours ago now and email address changed. I still have not heard back from support. I still cannot login either.  &lt;--- AND im not the only one this is happening to!!!

It is rumored they will be adding LTC support, no mention of any actual date this will happen thou. Considering how much trouble Gox is currently having keeping up with BTC trading volume, I have a hard time seeing them add another currency anytime soon...

It is indeed very unfortunate that many people can't be trusted. Cryptocurrency was designed to be decentralized to hypothetically circumvent the power structure that controls our worldly currencies, but humanity's propensity for greed is not confined to our governing bodies. I would, however, like to believe that not all of us have a price where we are willing to screw our fellow man.

Seconded. If human evil is the problem, how will human oversight solve the problem?

Agreed, although there weren't nearly as many complaints a week ago when I began trading on BTCe. I originally joined due to their support of litecoin, which was my primary interest. I also liked the fact that their service seemed to be much more stable than that of MtGox in the past few days. I guess at least MtGox hasnt been having hijacks like this....
