They are generally happy about this rb service as it brings more traffic to the poker room. They're not exactly thrilled though because some players are winning a lot and always cashing out.

Not really because there were a lot of rakeback providers before. But now I stumbled upon a deal that allows me to offer one of the highest out there.

But poker stars offers like 2-20% max rakeback. Here rakeback is 58-133%!

Lol, site has been active 5 months, but the service was around almost 2 years ago.

Not really, there's a community forum and chat to call out unethical behavior. Also most bots cannot beat good players. If good players know they're up against a bot, the bot could get exploited to death.
The bot takes advantage of the total fish and donks that just donate.

Wow why are you stalking me now? What did I do to make you angry?
Definitely not a scam as there are over 570 users on this program right now.

This rb service has only been around for 1 1/2 years so obviously I expect more users to know about this.
I often cringe when I see people making sites like PokerStars or Fulltilt their home. Those sites, due to their powerful grip on the industry, offer as little perk/reward for the loyal players. So it ends up being a nit fest where 10 pros are scavengers going after 1 or 2 fish.

I don't think that is needed since there is no exchange of money on the site; it is just to track sub referrals and rakeback status.

Site does not offer zoom. Site uses Bitcoin for deposit and cashout. 1 btc = 1000 chips.
The poker room takes a rake for every hand that goes to the flop. Rake is relatively low. Players under the rb service gets started off at 33% (sent via peer to peer transfer weekly) 10-50% vip rakeback and a 100% deposit bonus (an additional 15% rakeback).
There are also other perks like free rolls and additional 50% table starter rakeback one can initiate in the main wallet of the poker room platform.
An additional perk is that it shares its tournaments with WPN which boasts a $1m gtd tournament every so often that sees overlays.

I think you've got an issue following me around and trying to libel me.

Rake is 2% for heads up games and uncapped, but the rewards are surprisingly great obviously: 33% + 10-50% vip which moves up very easily for grinders + 100% deposit bonus worth another 15% rakeback.  Also a 50% tablestarter rakeback.  All these don't count against each other!
