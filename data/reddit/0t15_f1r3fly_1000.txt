None of the other crypto currencies are experiencing this shit show.

If the miners leave then BTC is screwed.....and they are leaving in droves.
Look up the hash rate. BTC has lost more than %58of it's hash rate while bit*Ash has gained nearly every miner that left BTC.  (I switched to peercoin because of profit yesterday afternoon)
hODL won't mean squat once there is no network.

Both sides will lose.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:03:44
BTC is still more profitable to mine.
Just because of the partisan trolls and childish attitudes ,like yours, I am moving my hash rate to peercoin. It's the most profitable right now anyway.
BTC and but bitcash will BOTH be damaged by this shit show.
Articles about "Bitcoin civil war" in mainstream media will be the death toll of crypto if you turds keep it up. 
Have fun grinning like a dog eating shit while BOTH currencies suffer.

I hate to admit it but it seems like that is indeed the case.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:20:32
I think this actually might be the end of BTC.
HODL won't mean shit once all the miners leave and take their hash rate with them.
I will be mining other coins until this shit storm is over.

Likely be the death toll of public trust in cryptos in general.
Meanwhile the partisan fools on BITH sides are cheering the others demise..... pitiful.

The massive fees and backlog are from inaction from the devs.
Everyone saw this coming, and this thread was full of stupid memes and blatant propaganda until the shit show started.
Now, the people who tried to stiffle discussion and fixes.....are the ones crying about being "attacked".
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:33:14
BTC is more profitable to mine. And it's price has regained MOST of what it lost already.
Keep turning investors away by acting like a spoiled internet kid, you're proving everything cryptos detractors said is true.
Idiots like you are keeping crypto down.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:38:22
No one has mentioned fees and block size issues...... LMFAO
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:44:46
It's sad that the devs let this shit happen.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:51:58
If they mention any other coin they most certainly are deleted.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:48:24
I agree with you totally, and so does anyone just getting into crypto currency.
This makes BOTH currencies look shady and unreliable.
