Thats just it; Bob's motives count for nothing, only his actions. Same for Ann.
Ann did low value work that anyone could do; and teenagers often do for spare change. It did not require much special talent, nor was it in high demand, but there were plenty of people willing to do it. You can put her up on a pedestal all you want, unless you are willing to give her a million bits of your own money, then she does not deserve a million bits.
Bob, regardless of why he did it, unintentionally helped to launch a new form of money from near ground zero; his inadvertent contribution to society included freeing countless millions of people from the grip of socialist slavery and automated theft. Bob, be he good or bad as an individual, made an amazing huge positive contribution to society. And then, he held on to his crypto currency as the price continued to rise; not giving into early greed like you would expect a "bad" person to do. His reluctance to spend early allowed the spending and savings of others to grow, and helped prevent communists from killing the network off with attacks such as b-cash or rip.ple. And he was rewarded in kind.
Bob saved millions of people, contributed to society greatly, and was fairly rewarded. Ann did very little and was rewarded very little as is appropriate. Your personal morality, and screwed up value systems which value menial labor over real results are utterly irrelevant to the free market: it does not virtue signal, and it does not care about anything but true real contributions to society.

Wow, reading that makes me sad, sad that you work on a security project.
That is the absolutely wrong mindset. You are an ostrich sticking its head in the sand.
Monero has clear flaws, and just because a publicly served explorer isnt showing you the deanonymization that is happening for free, you assume its not happening. 
Just because its not trivial doesnt mean people arent doing it. 
Monero doesnt even have real joins, and the attack time to deanonymize it is forever. There is no PFS, no loss of information. All amounts, sources, destinations, and counterparties can be figured out. Several firms have put real money into this to earn a profit, and DNM's that use monero get rolled.

Lets say you won a "free" $100 prize, but to claim it you had to do 2 hours of labor. What is your cost basis ? 
If you pay someone $10 to deal with claiming it for you, your cost basis is $10.

If you rate yourself as worth $50/hour, you break even by claiming it.

They count the fees charged by the exchange itself, but not others. Mostly thats because they report separately to the IRS. 
On the whole, most "airdrops" are just an annoyance. Most people dont bother claiming them, even though they have technically "received" them, they havent "received" them in any concrete way.
This is somewhat unprecendented on the legacy fiat/investing side of things; There is no external way to know if someone has claimed an airdrop or not except for the content of their mind and the decision they ultimately make. 
If an "airdrop" coin forked in 2010, and you decided not to claim it forever, then its simple - no income no expenses. You might not even be aware of it if you didnt pay attention to shitcoin drops.
But if you discover 10 years later than you want it, now you are in a pickle; you 
"received" something 10 years ago which was never reported on taxes. So the taxable event - the receipt of the new coins is already gone and past the 10 year limitation time. 
Its also possible that the shitcoin was so obscure when you received it, that it didnt even have a real "price". 
IMO, the entire concept of how forks and taxation work is entirely broken.

Here is a simple example: the ceo of a defense contractor gets 100% of his money from the government (that means from people who do real work). His real tax rate is always negative: even at 100% tax rate, he is still breaking even.
Next; instead of taking salary he takes options vs the stock. Then instead of selling the stock, he loans it to his bank.  Now he has whatever salary he likes with zero tax obligation. A little sales tax just means he need to pass on more cost back to you, the guy who's paying for it all, so he enjoys the exact same lifestyle as before.

"Money" as a system for trading value is not a zero sum game. 
Communication networks, such a specific form of money, are. 
One network generally wins at the expense of the others. The zero sum, in this case, is in which networks people use as money settlement signaling.
The various Fiats have been in direct competition with bitcoin for the past 10 years. Fiat has been losing pretty badly so far. Shitcoins are also competing for the space, and also failing. 
In a zero sum game, there can only be one winner in the end. The only reason that there isnt one worldwide fiat is because governments give out local monopolies to their pet fiat, by definition.

Does the join coordinator block already used addresses with a known history ? I know it does nothing to change the nature of the attack; but at least armchair forensics would be slightly less easy.
Even attempting to use a previously historied address could cause the coordinator to silently block your IP address: maybe even pretend to respond but not actually include the banned transaction in the join.... although I suppose the client could distinguish whether or not the signature of the blinding input checks out or not.

So a few employees of those companies lose their jobs. The rich wont care one whit; they can pass on the costs through their businesses.

Taxes are a tool that cannot work that way. The wealthiest get their money from taxes and regulation. There is no tax that can hurt them. 
The only way to help the poor is to not tax them in the first place. 
Instead of a poor-hurting UBI, which will raise prices more than it will give money, why not just exempt anyone earning less than 80K/year from even filling a tax return ?

So you think these companies wont cut any payrolls, nor will they increases prices and pass them on  to consumers. They'll just take a hit to profit ? Lets say that was true; what would it mean? It would mean new dollars flooding into the market for basic goods and services, which means inflation. 
Lets say its not true; what would that mean? It would mean they cut payroll and raise prices, which means inflation. 
Are you starting to see the picture yet? All your plan shows is fucking over the working class for no gain whatsoever. You give them a 1000 check then a greater than 1000 dollar cost increase, assuming they get to keep their jobs in the first place.
If you want to make life better for the working class, you need to think about deregulation. Stop subsidizing the big megacorporations, rather than asking them to lean harder on the working class. 
VAT, and all taxes like it, takes money out of the pockets of the poor, and puts it directly into the pockets of the rich. Medieval peasants understood how taxes work, why cant you? You cannot pay taxes if you do not create value. Of course those who work are the only ones who create value. Do you think fat billionaires lounging around are creating value that can be taxed?

Right, its a catch22; and I suppose it cannot block the IP for subsequent joins in the future either, because of tor. So once someone is accepted into the round, given a valid blinded signature, then they cant be left out of the round. 
OTOH; perhaps the source address having more than one output in its history could be used to decide to exclude an input from the round... I know as you said it doesnt really change the security of the join much aside from not wasting space or giving a false impression of real round size. That said, the latter two are nice enough to consider it. If utxohistory(input.addr).length &gt; 1  then reject input. If its as easy as that, maybe it can be considered...


Would it be possible for a hostile coordinator to give an invalid blinded signature in order to get the client to reveal their desired output address without needing to include them in the join ?

Then how do you accept the fairly obvious flooding attack? With fairly modest participation, you can undo the fake joins and find the simple non-join transactions hiding underneath. With a real join coin, in which there is no hidden truth behind the curtain to reveal.

It doesnt matter what you tax; there is only one class of person who ultimately must be the payer - that is the person who produces wealth.


They work at businesses and earn their salary producing luxury items. These jobs are one of the few ways we can work to undo the damage caused by taxes. 
The poor do pay for rents, food, basic clothes and consumer goods. The rich pass on any amount of taxes through those channels, and the extra money injected by the government exacerbates prices rises. 
The whole UBI concept is self defeating. 
Why not instead give a tax break to the poor? Exempt individuals who earn less than some amount from even having to file a return. That returns value to their hands without first giving it to the rich.
UBI is just a trickle down plan.

This is a separate and unrelated topic which is not relevant.
OP's point is that the common goods and services we buy should get cheaper because they literally got less valuable. 
For example: a person who used to make X loaves of bread per day now makes X + Y loaves.
So noone's wages necessarily have to go down. Nothing else really changes except there are more bread loaves for a lower price. 
The prices of common goods we all use can go down and that doesnt mean anyones wages would be affected. 
There *is* some change of work associated with progress; In this example if people simple spend less on bread, then fewer bread bakers are needed. In that case, invariably the old bakers move up to a higher order work and that is determined by what people buy with the money they saved on bread.
The economy is large enough, and people are flexible enough that it works out. If that was not the case, then 95% of people would still be farmers. Wages do not go down at all.
The upshot is that: when prices stay the same you are being robbed.

In addition to shady exchanges doing fractional reservation, and more likely that idiot CEO's playing games with customer's funds, is the fact that BTC held on exchanges will be made available for short sales. 
This means that every BTC you take off the exchanges causes massive upwards price pressure, because it is no longer available for all the games and tricks that depress the price.  There is also a fringe benefit: the next time an exchange folds or exit scams you wont be left holding an empty bag.

While that would be a dream scenario, I'm not sure they can really do it. Whenever the dollar dips lower, their ability to keep the export market alive diminishes and starts to cause pain long before the USA even feels an itch. 
China has really backed themselves into a corner economically; they cannot afford to let the house of cards collapse, but they also cannot stop adding cards to the house. They need the dollar to be high both so that their exports keep moving and producing income, and also so that their treasuries and assets keep their value.

Correct, but thats a very small part of it. Take a person like bill gates, a supposed capitalist. Figure out his marginal cost for selling copies of software (its zero) Calculate how much the government pays him for said zero cost product. Ergo, welfare for a billionaire. 
Then realize how the rich take income: as new debt. That means they are completely inured to taxes and tax rates. Their debts and properties change value, but there is never anything to take but a token amount; a pretty lie.
There is no tax rate which can solve this, not even 100%. The game is flat rigged.

Did people all get salary raises along with the inflation? Was the new money printed directly into their savings accounts ? No, it wasnt.
Increasing fiat volume does cost the people more - they just dont get as much BTC as they used to.  So its still significant for them, even if its not going to have an impact on the rest of the world directly.
To be ready for these events, people need to save, earn, and spend BTC *before* the crisis. 
Poverty and stagnation can never generate wealth. While its a nice escape valve to help them avoid some of the worst of their recessions, its still a recession for them.
What BTC needs to really grow is a strong thriving economy with a free market. Until these countries can get past their socialism, they are never going to be a significant world presence.

Without using bitcoin for spending or earning, you could make a low cost bet by simply saving in bitcoin. Unless you try to game the timing or act recklessly, it has been nearly impossible to lose money saving bitcoin. 
The competing fiat currencies have very real and apparent weaknesses, so it is a fairly safe bet. Value over time, privacy, safety, and many others weaknesses exist for fiat that make it nearly useless for savings.


I agree; but that said there are a few segments where it makes more sense to accept bitcoin. Fiat breaks down at national borders. 
Countries with banking problem, such as greek exporters during the greek banking crisis, would have stood to gain substantially if their customers were prepared to pay invoices in bitcoin.
International sales in general has similar benefits, because receiving all manner of foreign credit cards is vastly more difficult than receiving a universal currency. 
As for individual earnings; doing online international work for bitcoin is a growing trend, and one i expect will continue to grow. Its simply a lot easier for both parties to pay for freelancers with bitcoin, especially across borders with weak fiat links. 
We are also witnessing a remittance revolution unfolding right now; bitcoin is altering the landscape. At some point bitcoin will simply kill the remittance industry and it will cease to exist in a meaningful form 
Right now; observing the market unfold; bitcoin seems inevitable.

The electrum mnem is only supported by a single wallet. It has already confused many people with its strange sometimes 12 sometimes 13 mnemonics, who assume they are compatible with other wallets (they are not). Electrum may or may not still support their current mnemonic scheme in 10 years. If the project is no longer maintained, you might need to find a python programmer to get it working, and that will be your only recourse. (considering the sloppy nature of the code, and the way python and pip package often break compatibility, this could be quite an expensive chore.)
The **vast majority** of wallets adhere to bip39 + bip44. If you buy any new wallet 10 years from now, odds are nearly guaranteed it will load up your mnemonic and work.
Overall, its much safer to stick to the popular standard, and to avoid platform specific keys.  If the electrum standard was broadly supported, you could argue otherwise. As it stands now, its a unicorn and thus best avoided. If you cannot use bip44 with electrum, because it drops support, then best action is to avoid using electrum and use almost any other wallet.

your first mistake ; they are known scammers associated with roger ver. They clearly fall back to sending your coins to their slush fund, which is their business model.


A 20 deep gap limit makes sense for a personal pocket wallet, but makes no sense at all for any kind of business situation. You will want to get a proper deterministic wallet system in place for business, which does not have a gap based scanning system but instead records your invoices and tracks which address index was used for each. It should never reuse addresses in any situation, leaving each one as a permanent record of a past invoice.

absolutely not. 
Bitcoin banking will not work if it is burdened with aml/kyc/bsa/etc. This leaves it with no advantage over legacy banks. Coinbase is just a shitty exchange given a partial monopoly by the government. They are part of the legacy system, as their advantage is access to legacy banking.
Future banks will be very different. They may still offer storage of money, and off-chain transactions. They likely will not offer consumer loans to any significant degree. They may finance certain business activities, such as inventory loans, or factoring invoices.  They will offer escrow services, such as consumer protection purchasing where they hold on to bitcoin spent for a period of days before allowing the merchant to withdraw it.

Samourai and electrum seem to support it or plan to do so. It remains to be seen what will emerge regarding bech32 wallet standards; unlike bip44 for p2pkh; there is not yet a strong standard across all wallets for how bech32 native segwit will be done.  


Unlikely, unless they are poorly designed or user unfriendly. At the very least, find-and-sweep will work.
If segwit keeps growing on plan, we could say  bip39/44/49/84, or we can just say "bip39" and everyone will know that it means the whole set. remains to be seen if 49/84 will become common or not.

Fiat/legacy exchanges fully admit that they use your stocks and dollars for various lending purposes. This is less risky with dollars and stocks because they have very elastic supply. With bitcoin this is somewhat treacherous due to a fairly inelastic supply. I would assume exchanges are doing it at risk in any case.
I dont think this has a positive effect on the market; for one reason the hodlers who's hodlings are being used this way are not being compensated and not aware of the risks. Secondly, it allows the exchange to try some fractional reservation. Both of those effect lend themselves to a reduced cost of market manipulation, imo.
While short selling does have some ethical/useful basis in a market - to help curb bubbles or provide liquidity in a spread, having too much shortable coin available at too low of a borrow price makes for cheap market manipulation, imo. Thats why I suggest not to use exchanges for holding. And I do not think that the excess of cheap shorting material is a real help for liquidity in any meaningful way - shorting helps unstuck a bubble or deep spread but it doesnt take much to perform that function. And it should come with market-appropriate pricing.

If you presume that it is the chinese government which is actually controlling and manipulating bitmain/BCH, it makes sense to label it Fiat. 
Like all chinese businesses, the bitcoin sector is cloely managed by the chinese government. The mechanisms of that control is an artificially high level of control over mining hardware, operating the vast majority of economic nodes, control over the participating dev groups, control over several exchanges, and the ability to hard-fork the network at will. 
Its also possible that they will lose control of the mining hardware market, and that the economics of mining make their project increasingly insecure but, bcash is already joke level security so that clearly doesnt matter. They will use unlimited hardforking to wave away any attacks - which coincidentally is exactly how legacy fiat systems work.
The main missing component is the "legal tender" aspect - but we have seen bitmain mandating Bcash for mining equipment - which if orchestrated by the state works out to a limited form of legal tender. If they go so far as to dump bcash on a creditor or as part of a confiscation scheme, then it will be full fledged fiat.
 
I think its already close enough to call fiat now.

Probably not; the very nature of bitcoin means banks dont really have a role.
If large importers and exporters started settling trade in BTC, that would matter. 
If the real estate market was mostly priced in bitcoin and fiat was largely unaccepted, that would matter.
If typical major purchases were done in bitcoin, such as cars, that would matter.
If debt based freshly printed money was rejected for large transfers, that would matter. 
If companies worked with their suppliers in bitcoin, that would matter.
If small fiat transfers were generally converted to bitcoin for savings rather than deposited into a bank, that would matter. 
Bank adoption means nothing at all, because there is no role for a bank. They dont build houses, they dont build products, they dont export or import anything, they dont do anything but charge overhead.  With bitcoin, their reason for existence is largely nullified.

There are stealth address schemes which avoid op_return all together, which i believe is the largest downside of most of today's schemes. Being able to make a "permanent public address" is not that great of a benefit, and not needing any communication outside of the blockchain is too arbitrary a restriction which leads to poor design decisions, imo.
As for your example transactions, i can eyeball them real quick.
Appears to be a single wallet tx styled as a coinjoin, (*) =&gt; change (15L1grLE, 1H9dp3o) , Wallet "F" (39s18H, 3KhdA7)
Even with a quick look it appears many of the output coins are all swept back together or spent normally, so this tx appears to be not a real join. Both the same size outputs seem to remain under control of one party: "F". 
Due to some errors, this appears to involve some manual/human work in transaction formation. (perhaps manual destination selection)
If you are asserting one of these two is made by stonewall it would be this one, because of the two this is the only one I think the code could actually synthesize. If this is stonewall, it made a near-dust output for no good reason imo.
Appears to be a coinjoin. (but transparent and providing zero privacy)
A ( bc1qpcyue,  bc1qx3vr, bc1qshhw) =&gt; A (3DwEmoH,  bc1q8m6)
joined with
B( 3QZ8DEA) =&gt;  B ( 39Vv7q,  3HVUdU) 
Due to the mix of segwit input types, it doesnt appear to be something samourai would synthesize from a single wallet.
It does look like something joinmarket might make. Most of the outputs participate in further joins, or other multi-wallet activity patterns.

bip47 is just stealth addresses. But it is poorly designed, because it uses OP_RETURN, the transactions stands out on the blockchain like sore thumbs. Its not something you want to use if you plan to avoid drawing attention. There are better methods of performing stealth transactions that do not leave such fingerprints.
STONEWALL is just larping of coinjoin. Because of the way wallet analysis works, this has zero effect on privacy. Defeating wallet association requires a large transaction graph, which stonewall cannot provide because it is not a coin join.

The way trade between the USA and china works out is essentially exploitation of the Chinese working class, with the gain split between US consumers and Chinese communist leaders. 
Like all market distortions - it is unhealthy. An economy with fewer barriers would allow workers in china somewhat better access to the international market for their work, and remove the overhead costs of unproductive communists. 
It would also un-distort production of goods somewhat, which I suspect would lead to less of a centralization of so many types of production in china.

Temporary collusion, informed and enabled by exchange owners, is somewhat inevitable when there are not enough exchanges on the market, and the users of said exchange give long lasting interest-free loans to the exchange. 
I agree with you that the market would be able to suppress such collusion naturally, but we would need many more exchanges (i.e. fewer regulatory barriers to setting up a new exchange) and a more informed user base who do not trust the exchange to hold idle BTC for long periods of time.
The former is hard to fix, but the latter is just a matter of sharing information and ideas. 
At some point, I hope that the value of direct BTC usage starts to dwarf exchange volumes, and thus fiat exchanges will no longer be able to cause any significant value volatility or manipulation.
Right now, most BTC pricing is still caused by FIAT/BTC trades, but with enough real world goods and services being traded in btc instead, that could change in the future.
Until then I do think collusion is real; but i do not think it can cause long-lived impact on prices. Only day traders real lose money on such games.

That depends on what you mean by trading. If you strictly work in small amounts; deposit, trade, and withdrawal, you can limit your exposure. Worst case you lose your last transaction. 
If you want to dump off a large amount and play the market, well, you have to accept that you are giving your money to someone else, and it doesn't really belong to you anymore.  Bank money does not belong to you, it belongs to them. If they feel like it, they sometime let you keep the illusion of control. But private keys are the only real control.
Personally, I would say day trading is dumb, so it makes no sense to deposit more funds into any kind of bank or exchange than you are willing to risk losing.

I think their main problem is that they have been gambling and mismanaging their company. 
The type of technological edge they held is not sustainable; bitcoin mining is not rocket science. Its just logistics and fairly obvious incremental optimizations. They have done their best to fight the inevitable with patents, backroom bribes, and other tactics, but those were never going to give them permanent dominance. 
They even tried to swap out bitcoin for a new network; one they could control. It didnt work, and has likely cost them half a billion dollars or more. 
So what do you do with a business that has peaked, and you are looking at an inevitable steep drop off a cliff? You sell it to someone else while it still looks valuable.
bitcoin asic production will be commoditized. Eventually, mining gear will be no more precious or single-source than TV's, and they'll be made interchangeably and boringly by hundreds of manufacturers, with near identical performance.  Companies will have to start to compete on value-adds, form factors, etc.

*everyone who is not planning to sell btc anytime soon*
If they were not planning to trade it doesnt make a difference. 
Unlike USD - BTC does not require a multiple-day confirmation time. if you want to sell 1B satoshi, its very fast to deposit and make the trade. So withdrawing BTC while not planning to trade has no impact on liq.

Sure - what good is money if you are chopped up into pieces.


You could pay a regular and large/generous term life insurance premium with them as the beneficiary. If you die, then coin becomes global charity. Thats a partial solution. You could also just give them the coins early.
As for perfect post-death inheritance... give them time locked signed transaction that cannot be mined for 5 years, or something like that. You can sweep the source utxo and regenerate the inheritance tx's periodically if you live, to keep deferring the inheritance. (You are counting on them not to lose their wallets over those years, but you can regenerate to a new destination too if they lose it while you are alive)
so once you die they have to wait some number of years to claim it, by posting the transaction.
Perhaps just print and secure them in a vault, refreshed once per year. you can do all the metal stamping and fireproofing you want for this. (an actual use case more so than person backup, imo)

Correct; the wallet could scan and automatically detect them as usual too. It doesnt have to be much in the way of additional complexity from the user's POV, and it allows them to instantly learn who sent them money without any additional messaging. I would say it all around superior for this use case. 


Unless you mean analysis by casuals who click around on blockchain.info, i think you overestimate the value. An serious analyst will start from a basic automated correlation, which wipes out isolated stonewalls without any additional cost or time needed.


Ironically, those provide less privacy. Coinjoin actually mixes funds, while those simply attempt to hide funds without real mixing. Purely fake joins, such as made in monero, leave a ground truth in their wake, which means once the veil is pierced there is zero remaining privacy. Coinjoin however, always leaves some levels of plausible deniability, if done well. 


Agreed; It would be nice to have a tumbling network enabled by default in a popular wallet, with reasonable overhead/liquidity cost. Something like dash for bitcoin, but voluntary and no centralization.

Why can socialists not step back and just allow people to do good; why do they reach for the whip and try to force "good" in their own conceit ?
It is the arrogance of socialists that they think they can decide everything for everyone.  You invented this whole topic of teaching just so you could make rules and laws that would magically solve everythign, but in realty only make things worse. 
In the comic the net was simple, easy to copy, and the other fishers just didnt want to make them.  There was no secret technique or socialist patent on nets.


Perfect - no, far from it. There is plenty of socialism to stomp out before the world can get better.


Spanish 


Capitalism is free trade. Capitalism is voluntarism. Capitalism is altruistic society. Capitalism is freedom. Its an extremely simple concept, with many names. But its very simple: everyone is equal, noone is privileged or empowered over another.


The comic, in case you missed it, is raging against FRB. It is absolutely opposed to FRB and socialism in general and build up to it from simple principles that a child can understand. The author died in prison for opposing socialism of money.
If you missed that, I suggest you re-read the comic. 


False; All of the good things in the world have come from peaceful individual actions. All the evil in the world has come from attempting to dominate the lives of others.
When you attempt to dominate others, you are evil, full stop. It doesnt matter what lies or justifications you tell yourself. Even if you truly believe you are dominating them to "make them happy" you are still evil for it.
A good summary of the flaw of socialism is "evil done in the name of good".


Lol, no. Claiming to be good, doesnt make one good if you espouse the tools of domination.

Each large corporation can be traced to a regulation or tax which causes them to exist. And they would collapse instantly without the support of government. Its very easy to prove: COMCAST - telecom franchise laws. Microsoft: copyright. Mega-banks: the fed &amp; banking laws. Exxon: dept of energy and the EPA. Monsanto and Big pharma: the FDA and DEA.
Socialism is exactly the cause of megacorporations, war, and pollution, wage slavery, and really most of the things idiots try to pin on capitalism.
Capitalism is when the workers own the means of production, and they are not taxed of the surplus of labor. Bitcoin is a tool to help make the world more capitalist. 
It will help to stop megacorporations from forming, and to stop socialists from stealing the surplus of labor.

For what purpose? Anonymous public charity destinations while not connected to the internet is the only realistic scenario I can think of. In other cases, you want to communicate with the person you are sending money to, so they know who to give credit or thanks to. In those cases, you can easily get a fresh address.
I think this may be a case of "what a user thinks they want" not being what they need. I remain skeptical of this feature.






If one party does not control the outputs, there is ample evidence that they are very highly related. Most likely they belong to one person or group. 


I noticed that the first tx in particular appears to be manually created.  


The standard wallet seems to prefer to stick to one address pattern. A typical user is not going to be performing custom TX layout by hand. Honeslty, I would prefer if the xpub/ypub/zpub standard was abandoned in favor of auto-detecting all families of utxo belonging to the privkey. 
In general; neither TX follows the precise semantics of a joinmarket join; all though the second one does come closer it is still has one discrepancy.


It could lead to wallet fragmentation over time, which usually leads to privacy compromising consolidation sweeps. The tx chains you showed had several large consolidation sweeps, which tend to deanonymize the full graph. 
I do think there is a role for something like stonewall; specifically in combination with real coinjoins it can help to bridge real spends in between join tx's, and reduce the information available for forensics. For example; if samourai were to have a p2p network for voluntary joins, and defaulted to opportunistically mixing on spends, it would be valuable in combination with stonewall type techniques when there is no liquidity or the user doesnt want to subsidize liquidity. 
Among the many flaws in joinmarket, is the fact that is is not simultaneously a normal-use wallet is among the largest.

Yeah, thats the whole idea of teaching them instead of doing it for them.


Unlike Apple, our hero does not rely upon a government monopoly, and threaten to have them beaten to death if they attempt to make nets. They are free to learn from and copy his net design all they want.


No its is not. Its assuming that it is up to the two guys to decide that. Its entirely possibly they lack the skill. And if they decide its not for them, then capitalism provides an excellent alternative for them to improve their lives which would otherwise not be available to them. Nature, without capitalism, is a harsh and unforgiving place. Capitalism is cooperation without the type of theft or murder you seem to advocate.
If you cant understand these child level lessons, that explains why you are still mired in socialism.

You are radically misrepresenting liquidity, imo. Holding balances which you have no intention of selling does absolutely nothing for liquidity. People who have open orders to buy or sell provide liquidity. Hodling does not and should not provide liquidity. 
If you want to make your BTC available for shorters, then at least you should get paid for it. 
Giving it to shorters for free is dumb - and so is holding fake/non-existent bitcoin - you could end up a dollar bagholder or worse, get finexed. 
Bitcoin remains liquid even if it is not on an exchange. You can deposit it and sell it in minutes, seconds with LN. 
So the basis for your entire argument is wrong. Holding bitcoin long term off exchange is strictly superior to holding it on-exchange, and there is zero loss of liquidity.
@_date: 2018-09-20 18:56:31


A xpub derived from a specific hardened path is arguably much better for this purpose. This allows normal payment transactions, and an automatic history for both the payer and payee.


not due to stonewall in specific, no. Bitcoin is always pseudonymous. And when manually crafted transactions are involved, then literally anything is possible. (you can trade private keys and do 1000 OBC transactions and make all analysis impossible.)
The only time privacy is lost fully is when someone publicity claims certain activity and proves it. Any other methods used to analyze the blockchain rely on probability. Users tend to fall into routine behavior and predictable software usage. For the purposes of this discussion, that is what matters.
Stonewall did not add any security to these transactions by that measure. 


A reason I think wallets should support all three simultaneously, at least for joining and receiving. I'm displeased with the direction taken by electrum and samou on that topic. 


I would caution users against relying on stonewall alone. It absolutely has a role, I just dont want to mislead them to thinking it has any value on its own. It can be part of a mixing network integration, but when used on its own it will not confound normal graph analysis. 
If you are interested, I can make some suggestions about how to improve your cloaking. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:50:55


You said withdrawing from exchanges removes liquidity by reducing supply. That is wrong.

Sure, and so long as people take lower prices you would be a fool to pay extra. But thats not relevant, because the price that matters in the market is the actual price that people would take. 
You would not argue that people would just keep paying less and less until all prices are zero, would you? Because the customer does not set the price, they generally take the lowest price they can get.


I will disagree with this; it makes sense to spend what you earn with as little overhead as possible. It makes perfectly fine sense to spend earned bitcoin as it does earned dollars; there is no meaningful difference in that. What ever costs you less to spend is what you should spend. 
If all your income is in bitcoin form, you would obviously spend bitcoin as directly as possible, for any expenses that you have.
Like the previous discussion, bitcoin for spending will be driven more by what merchants accept than by what people want to dump. 
If you said: in the short term, the primary case for bitcoin is for savings, i would agree. Most people earn fiat and have some cost to convert to bitcoin. Most merchants accept fiat and not bitcoin. 
So it only makes sense to convert fiat to bitcoin and spend it when there is some other advantage to it. And thats perfectly fine.

Sure, usenet beat reddit for decentralization. personal home pages beat facebooks, and email beat webmail for decentralization. At first. But those things were all somewhat flawed and subject to attack.
A personal home page tended to be clunky and poorly cross indexed, lots of work and cost to maintain, low discover-ability. They got lost in spam sites and malware sites. Email nearly died off to spam, which seemed to be an insurmountable problem. Modern email is in theory p2p, but in practice very centralized. Usenet resorted to defacto centralization to stop warez and kiddie porns, then got killed off anyway. Couchsurfing was always high risk behavior - no reputation network existed - so it was never a viable hotel alternative. 
Really the only true survivor is bittorrent (because a legal version cannot exist) and bitcoin (because it solves problems no other network can). You might count gpg and ssl as p2p to some extent, but they are very niche apps still. 
The fact is that decentralization is hard and centralization is a far easier path to solve things. I'm not surprised at all that the first generation of "sharing" economy apps are centralized - its just a lot easier to solve and has a clearer business proposition. They are also doomed long term however, because there is little ongoing value in those networks. 
A decentralized Uber would require an open source app/network/ecosystem, thousands of hours of top deck developer time, a large an dedicated community, and some very innovative P2P coding to handle reputation networks, arbitration, bonds, insurance, etc. 
So far, bitcoin solves the permissionless payments aspects, but much remains to be done.

You cant name an exploitative mega corporation, billionaire, or army which would benefit from the lack of government, because there are none. They are creations of government.
Its quite humorous when statists support explicit taxation and regulation and then claim that a lack of theft and tyranny would create theft and tyranny. Do you even hear yourself?

This is highly unlikely. You memorize a ton of information, but you mind knows it can write things down so it tries as hard as it can not to waste space. Mnemonics allow you to bypass that instinct and program your long term memory.  It will be the last thing you forget.
The alternative is to memorize nothing meaningful at all, then your data is only as secure as you can physically hide it. Laziness is the only reason to avoid learning how to memorize the minimum safe amount of entropy. 


I think the model T is a huge improvement also


I was into mnemonics long before bitcoin existed. For example: if you want to memorize thousands of chinese characters without lifelong devotion, you can do it with mnemonics fairly easily. When I see people balk at memorizing a handful of words... i suspect they are compromising their own security through either ignorance or laziness.


So long as you are aware of what trade off you are making. When you choose to print out or stamp your secret in metal; from a cryptographic POV you have just handed it to your opponent, and the lock starts ticking on a crack. 
If it is protected by anything less than 128 bits, its only a matter of time before it is cracked. Usually a lot shorter time than you think.
I highly recommend learning how to memorize the minimum viable password to resist indefinite attack duration: a 12 word bip39 phrase.

Its cooperative - not competitive like a zero sum game such as football. you dont help the other team score in football. In capitalism you can only score when the other team does too.
Cooperation involves doing what people need rather than doing useless/waste activities. So the only "competition" is weeding out waste and eliminating excess profit. You need to learn the basics of why capitalism works.


False; you should read the first book on economics. The invisible hand is a fundamental concept of how voluntary interaction works.


it does not contradict my point at all. People will not do anything for money; they wont die for it. Its a means to an ends, and not an end in itself. 
Your problem is perhaps that you think money == wealth. 
Money is not wealth, its a communications network for merit. It is the fingers of the invisible hand.
Its the reason bitcoin will defeat your evil and confused ideology.

Maduro - he just got reelected. democracy is the *first* problem with their system, and the root cause for its collapse. The US was just saved twice in a row by checks on democracy (the rigged democratic superdelegates which blocked the populist socialist, and the electoral college which blocked the murderess gang boss from taking power)
The USA would have had its own Hugo Chavez in power right now if it had a pure democracy with no checks and balances. You would be eating zebra flesh while bernie sandinista spoke to you on some flickering post-apocalyptic broadcast about how "capitalism has failed"

Its also true in general that people who are easily tricked by hucksters, shills, and snake oil salemen, conmen and the like tend to be those who are naive and less informed. Even if we try to protect them with laws, they will be coughing up their life savings to the next Nigerian prince to call them.
There is no solution for it really - noone can protect them. they have to learn from the school of hard knox.  We should really have a policy of "personal responsibility" rather than consumer protection. The former works; the latter actually exacerbates the problem by giving people a false sense of security.

@_date: 2018-08-13 21:10:11


Its not that easy... Even if they rollback the BCH blockchain, they might also have to reorg the BTC blockchain - which is where the double spent coins would have been converted to in order to get value out of the exchange. This is impractical - so at most they can return the bch back the the exchange.
Even if they roll it back, the attacker could make a fortune shorting in the mean time.
And after all that, the whole attack can be repeated unless they continue to mine at a loss indefinitely.

People and companies care about specific price changes; govenment cares about inflation rates because its tied to their policies.
The problem with your definition of inflation is that it doesnt give you information about either real price movements or real monetary movements; just some sort of sloppy sum of the two. Its a purely political number
Any real price inflation metric would show most real prices trending down, while monetary supply trended upward, over time. This would be bad politics however, because it would reveal exactly how much productivity is being stolen via inflation.

Do you feel it is more general purpose or superior to the other protocols for it? I have seen simple JSON file formats which send essentially all the same information and are very simple to implement and dont need a bespoke binary format. (json being fairly good at simple key value pairs) Do you know of any wallets or services that have specific plans to implement bip174 besides core? 
For now; and for starters, its just a feature for core. 
I could see bip174 becoming another common protocol handled by many services eventually, it it becomes popular.

I'm fine with those; assuming they are used in civil courts to settle disputes and not used by the government directly. Really those type of laws are just suggestions to civil court arbitrators about what types of contracts should not be honored.  For example: click through dialogs on websites and software installers should have no legal power.

Its unlikely to have been a problem even if used as an attack.
Remember: the bcash network has very very few nodes, and the mining nodes are all running the same version. Unless there is some diversity in mining bcash, you cant really hope to be able to split the network.
So this particular bug was more useful as a publicity stunt than an actual attack.
Even if you do fork their network, as a centralized shitcoin bcash can more easily hard fork or redirect hashpower even if the network is split 7 ways. For them, hardforks are not a big deal; when you are already a junkie whats one more needle?
The only real attack on bcash will be a massive double spend which cannot be reversed, because the funds will have been exchanged to the real blockchain. Its coming soon enough, dont worry. Then it dies.

... in football being near your own goal means you have an increased chance of losing. In the market, the other team would be helping you win, so there is no downside for being near your own goal. In fact, you have less to lose and more to gain. 


not "force", "convince". Power is when you can convince people to commit suicide on your behalf. That is the riddle of steel. 
*sigh* "Convince people to take action that risk their lives at a below market rate" is somewhat more accurate but less succinct. Not all soldiering is as simple as suicide bombing. (I despair that i must include sentences such as these when debating a pedant.)
A state needs suicidal soldiers to propagate its power. The art of politics is the art of getting people to be your soldiers. Money cannot make soldiers; you can read this in human history over and over. Money transmits merit but not power. Money is inferior to power in that regard. Bolsheviks seized russia from the czar by recruiting soldiers: they could not have bought russia from the czar, nor seized it with paid merceneries. mercenries avoid battles where the other side shoots back - dying makes it hard to spend the money they are trying to earn.


Sure; im always willing to debate someone who seem to be somewhat genuine. 
Regarding entrenchment; I feel like near the end here you are no longer arguing in good faith or else we are running into terminological impasses. Most socialist I have debated are not really thinking about the topic; they are posing and rearranging words as if for an audience, to avoid the appearance of having "lost". 
If you are an ancap in the past, I cant see how you would have read "The wealth of nations" by adam smith, or "The law" by bastiat, and ever stopped being an ancap... 
You use a boogeyman definition of "capitalism" which is internally inconsistent, and seem to assert that political power is necessary to prevent the evils of political power - which i find unfathomable.
"Capitalism" as I describe it, is just "whatever happens when power is absent".

Only in an extreme short spending window. Any person who could save and/or slowly spend received money over a couple-year timeframe would have always had a better result with bitcoin than any fiat currency. And people who have been subject to high inflation or capital controls would have fared incomparably better.
So unless it is remittance for an emergency expense, remitting bitcoin is strictly better. And if the goal is to send home savings, bitcoin is better in every way.
The double-fiat jump is a very narrow use case, that shrinks with every passing day. A smart sender will already have some btc accumulated and will not need to freshly purchase any. A smart recipient will be able to convert it on an as-needed basis.
A next-gen remittance sender/receiver will earn and spend bitcoin directly.

The dollar of 1776 and the dollar of 2018 bear little resemblance.  The first national currency, the Continental Dollar, crashed to a final value of 0.
People were forced to accept the continental dollar against their will, as their goods and livestock were "impressed" in return for paper continentals. In the end, those bills became worthless.


Also, GDP does not mean economic growth. If the money was properly deflationary, then GDP would be a near-constant value uncorrelated to economic growth. So what you are actually plotting is some combination of dollar devaluation and ecnomic growth combined.
If you normalize for loss of dollar purchasing power, the growth seems like a measly and unimpressive 5000% increase over 250 years.

Generally I agree. The only time its not a scam is when the project is super predictable and there is a clean and simple capital investment required to complete it. Examples include ship building or private roads. There are few to no surprises; the expect income from the project easy to predict and the capital amount needed is well understood.
The only reason to IPO instead of getting a bank loan to finish the project is because you expect the other investors to earn less than the bank would charge in interest, or because the risk of loss is too high for the bank to sign up.
So in short yes; all IPO's are a form of "exit scam" technically speaking, with few exceptions. The rare roadside "free money" vendors are rarely honest.

Could be remade in a decentralized form. 
From the user's point of view, hotels and taxis were so regulated and cartelized that it really worked as a form of central control.
When anybody can rent out a spare room with no permission and little to no regulatory compliance, its more decentralized. 
Of course, the app platforms have a central control of their own, which is quickly becoming as bad or worse as what they replaced.

False dichotomy.
When you want to determine if industry regulation is beneficial, think of any dangerous or complicated job that people might do, and try to imagine if having a person yelling and pointing a gun at the head of the person doing it will help or hurt. 
Also, imagine that the guy with the gun can be bribed, and for a certain sum of money he will step back and allow you to pass, even if you didnt do the job right - his main goal is to pick the winners and collect bribes.

Lol, how hard/easy do you think its going to be to find someone who will take on a 1 billion worth of BCH ?  How hard or easy do you think it will be to find someone who will directly trade stocks for bch ?
The reality is nobody accepts BCH for anything right now except bitmain. As soon as bitmain stops buying the trade value will start falling rapidly, because there are no other buyers. 
Bitmain cant sell its BCH to itself... that means they have lost a fortune with no way to recoup it.
They essentially gave away hundred of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin for basically nothing in return. Live by the shitcoin, die by the shitcoin.

less profitable miners, such as those next to higher price electricity, can be forced to shutdown if they dip below profitability. Noone is going to mine them for a loss.
This can be a very low ratio for people with no cost, sunk cost, or non-savable electricity generation. 
But for people who pay for electricity as they go, they will simply shut down their equipment, and that can pressure hash rate to go down.

Food is good, mostly, not counting the UK. People do seem thinner and more healthy, also not counting the UK. the low salaries, high taxes, shit waits in hospitals or other govt run services, and overall lack of any reasonable level of self defense make it "suffer". Sure its better than wartime, but thats not saying much. People actually want to be government employees in most places, which is sad. Prices are mostly insane, even for common goods. Its a great place to get poor and stuck. 
People in general do seem more satisfied with a low station in life, and have less ambition. Get a big holiday break, and suck it up. And they are most trusting of their news media, like you seem to be. All those crimes are just "isolated incidents". Its really easy to see crime walking around london or oslo. And most EU countries have actual police no-go zones, which I find amazing. Its like you have an area that has been physically ceded to criminals, cops just give up. 
Say what you want about the US, but you dont get messed with nearly as much. People know you could be armed, so they are less likely to get stuck in with a stranger. And good or bad, the police will knock down any door; they havent had to start ceding territory yet.  And you can post nearly any thing you want online without worrying about getting arrested for hate speech.

* Person A gets a wallet which lists BCH as "bitcoin"
* Person A buys "Bitcoin" from some unscrupulous exchange which does not clearly show the difference, or  "Bitcoin Cash" thinking the cash is just an adjective. 
* The wallet of Person A now shows them that they have a "bitcoin" balance. So, they scan the barcode of the website, and the wallet confirms it is a bitcoin address and so sends the funds
* The website never shows the payment being received, and the company does not provide a way to recover the lost funds. (they wont share their private keys with untrusted node software)
Thus, funds are lost due to this deceptive practice. Punitive damages should be award to those who through fraud or negligence allowed this to happen. 
Honestly you could even make a case that by sharing the same address format, BCH wallets and exchanges are liable to some extent.

Its tougher with btc, because unlike gold, its fairly standard for hodlers to withdraw it.
Also, in opposition to most assets, whales are largely irrelevant. While they can cause big run-ups and run-downs in the price in the short term, they cannot do much in the big picture.
The reason is that their assets mostly stay on exchanges, so they cannot affect real supply and demand unless they actually withdraw to a real bitcoin wallet - which they are largely afraid to do.
Dollar deposits and withdraws also dont matter, because dollars can be infinitely created and destroyed, 
So the long term price is strictly a function of miners and small holders, those who make real bitcoin deposits and real bitcoin withdraws. 
Whales can make big waves, but cannot affect the water level much at all.
People who take their bitcoin off of the exchanges are the real mvp.
Of course, a "traitor whale" could change this equation: but only in one direction.

That is a far worse example. You can change to clang without requiring other people to change with you; only affects yourself. 
You cant do that with money. money is a network; like TCP vs SPX.  Go to a merchant and see if they will accept neoTurd coin or whatever; they wont. 
people are free to experiment. even TCP/IP changes over time. Thats not relevant at all. 
The point you are missing is that only one network predominates in production, due to the "network effect", it will predominate so overwhelmingly people will essentially forget about the alternatives.
The only way this equilibrium changes is when the main network is intentionally crippled or the alternative offers such a great value proposition it overcomes the disadvantage.
So bitcoin has an angle to displace the dollar, but shitcoins have no similar angle to overcome btc.

No. Blocksize increases scale poorly. 
A blockchain is a global ledger. It is the most expensive database in the world.  Increasing its size or rate should be done very carefully, and tied to the technology level of the internet and the speed of light vs the size of the planet. It cannot increase simply based on demand.
As an analogy: if you are riding in a horse-drawn carriage and you want to make it faster or larger, how many horses can you add before the system breaks down ?
To scale bitcoin, or any similar system, you need a layer 2 solution.

It depends on how strictly or loosely they interpret the bip70 protocol. The intention of the spec is partially to prevent payments that do not meet their requirements. They want to be able to blacklist certain coins, to control the fee amount and settings, etc. So if they dont like your proposed transaction, they can simply not honor it. 
I know that at the moment they seem to mostly honor direct payments, but they could very easily start ignoring them. And without the bip70 refund address, you will have a hard time getting your money back.
They certainly do refuse some payments today - if they are a bit later than their time window, or have a fee that is too low, or are sourced from their hard blacklist - you will lose your money and the merchant will not see the payment. 
Also, they dont support segwit so fuck them - just dont use bitpay.

Can it? What other possible application can there be for the least efficient database design in all of history ? Blockchain only makes sense when it is the *only* way to solve a problem. Money is a network, and thus wants to be a single protocol. 
These two facts strongly imply that bitcoin is the only application of blockchain. 
A simple analysis dispels all the value propositions of shitcoins and icos:
* P2P solves decentralization. 
* Reputation networks solve trust issues. 
* Cryptography solves various privacy and tamper resistance issues. 
* PoW Blockchain solves double spending (at a very high cost)
* Various anti-techs solve nothing only create problems (PoS, asic resistance, sharding, turing complete scripting, etc)
Internet Money requires P2P + Crypto + Blockchain (and must have none of the anti-techs).
Oracles (such as for smart contracts) require trust + tamper resistance.

I think you are right; To really address credit cards would be yet another layer. 
The original use case for credit cards was to replace things like bar tabs. 
They have grown into a kind of universal purchase insurance, but are plagued by also being a predatory "very-high-interest-debt-that-you-cant-bankrupt-out-of" system that preys on the foolish.
I'm not entirely sure the bar-tab concept needs a replacement. When you have convenient electronic money, you dont have so much need to spend money you dont have. 
Without the ability to prevent bankruptcy, fewer lenders will want to take the risk of offering consumer credit. And with better payment networks around, fewer merchants will want to eat chargebacks.
I can see a purchase insurance system replacing the credit cards costly combo of low security and chargebacks. Other than that, i suspect in the medium term credit cards will wane.

Its close to true but not quite; rather than *all* bank deposits, bitcoin would only necessarily replace all "foreign reserves". So purely domestic assets would not automatically be backed in bitcoin. Its unclear is the eurozone would work as one economy or not during bitcoinization; the greek currency crisis shows that not all euros are fungible.

This seems risky; there is no guarantee that bitpay will honor direct payments.
Sending bitcion to a payment protocol specified destination directly without confirming the proposed payment will be accepted is reckless.
I cannot recommend this approach: if you see a bitpay paywall just dont use it, or else use the payments protocol correctly.


That said; it seems most wallets dont actually hold back the payment for the paymentAck message, so perhaps there is no safe way for bitpay to reject raw sends. It would certainly screw over some customers, but we can tell bitpay is okay with that.

If bcash was consensus fork it would have simply taken over the name and there would be no other "bitcoin"  to confuse. If bcash could compete on merit, then would choose a clearly separate name like all other alts which forked off have done. (such a litecoin) 
Picking an intentionally confusing names such as "Bitcoin cryptocurrency" "Bitcoin money" "Bitcoin cash" are very close to fraud (enough that i think it counts) But outright mislabeling is simple fraud.
In polycentric ancap society, I suspect a much switfer punishment would have already been handed out.

Why do people assume that is a necessary step ? Who wants to hold money in fiat form ? You analysis is completely missing the mark.
Unless the receivers need to spend all the 4000 dollars immediately to a place that only accepts fiat, its far more efficient to send them BTC and have them spend it as they go, or spend it in btc form as they go.
The FX rate for sending BTC to another country is always zero, because its already there.
The reason you are forced to pay FX rates when sending USD internationally is because there is no other option. The bank dollar cannot exist overseas, its only exists in the US. You are *forced* to convert dollars into local bank money to be able to send it at all, and so FX rates are only problematic for the dollar side of the equation. 
With bitcoin, you have choices, because its not stuck in one country.

You seem to have missed my previous point. Its not about trademark, its the deliberate attempts to confuse and defraud people. You will notice there is no suit for the other coins using similar names: because they havent attempted to defraud people.

I believe a reasonable arbitrator would disagree with you. 
The people who have been defrauded had a reasonable expectation they were getting bitcoin and not something else. It is the common currency, listed everywhere and accepted everywhere, while the obscure altcoin is an attempt to cheat and confuse people into a coin which is accepted nearly noone and extremely obscure. 
If you try to play a cutesy game of bait and switch, the arbitrator will hit you with additional punitive damages. So for btrashers sake, they will hopefully come up with a better defense, or settle out of court before they get a big judgement.

Well, I agree it should be cheaper, but that is the typical price right now because they are expensive and risky.
The machines themselves have a cost.
Accepting cash is risky, and dealing with it challenging. You realize you cant just go deposit it in a bank right ? You have to pay someone to empty out the machine, and you have to find a way to get it on an exchange to replenish the bitcoin you sell. There is also the risk of stealing, theft, loss etc, because a box full of cash attracts thieves.
Next you have various legal compliance issues, reports to follow, lawyers to pay. So you pass all these cost on in the form of higher prices.
If you can get your state to deregulate them, it will be cheaper. If you can get a bank to take large cash deposits it will be even cheaper. Both of these are impossible right now, so its high overhead whenever cash and USD are involved.

Thats precisely what it is. 
They established themselves (and bitpay) as exclusive operators with regulatory capture.  Now that they dont have to worry about competitors offering viable alternatives, they can simply phase out the less profitable services to focus on what makes them the most (coinbase) OR charging extortionate fees and trying to push people onto a shitcoin-sideshow (bitpay) 
In free market capitalism, profits stay low because there is no place to hide and extract effort free monopoly rents. Deregulation of the crypto space would help everyone immensely. I dont expect it will happen easily however, because the regulations are old and long standing. Socialism is very much the "fuck you, i got mine" philosophy.

Good writeup nopara. 
Labeling/coloring coins on the wallet side is a smart practice. And with a wallet that is also a mixer, it can appropriately extract odd amounts out of joins and know which ones are mixed to which degree and which are not. 
In fact, labeling each tuxo with a taint %% might help. If there is an icon or image which represents a coin, you could darken the color to show taint, shiny golden at 0% taint all the way down to dripping poison and tentacle slime at 0%.
The hardest tokens to deal with are high taint coins from various sources. You naturally want to sweep them together to consolidate to a larger denomination, but cojoining them even in a coinjoin leaks too much shared ownership information...
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:48:59
I like that idea.  I think for a coin control wallet, that is probably mandatory. That said; what taint percentage is low enough to leak out of a coin cluster? 10%? 5%?  Perhaps 2% mutual taint isnt even enough to separate the cluster? 
Plain vanilla transactions with change transmit 100% taint to any change.
If a wallet was able to make every spend a coinjoin, then it would reduce the taint level of change, maybe even enough to decluster depending on distance. (To make this practical, the wallet could have offer a fee subsidy setting to speed things up. P2EP and stonewall probably count for nothing in this context)
Before any new transaction is signed, the wallet could warn the user what the new taint levels will be, and if any taint clusters will be linked revealing their relationship.
I realized I'm using two definitions of "taint":
* external metadata about a single bitcoin address/public key
* the mutual strength of correlation between two given outpoints
Perhaps those need separate words to make things clear. Perhaps "correlation rating" for the latter.
Taint is transmitted from any address to N outpoints directly, then flows up/down the graph of transactions with variable strength ratings. 100% correlation transmits 100% taint. I suppose taint computation depends fully on correlation computation, and must be re-performed when correlation information is updated... fairly computationally complex to model this accurately.

Yes. The only way to do it in core now is to look at each block since the beginning of time - or to ask the node wallet to do it for you. (which is obviously very slow)

That is an incredibly strange summary of "wealth".
Nature is all of planet earth, including ourselves. Its simply our environment; its not relevant to discussions of wealth, since it is not wealth it just is. We did not create the earth, we just decide how to allocate it. When everything is in the same category, then its not useful as a descriptor.
(1) Historical wealth is actually a reference to power, not wealth. Bankers do indeed care about power. 
Jackson also cared about power; he simply didnt want to share it with the bankers. His manifest Destiny plan was not something opposed by the bankers; their argument was over who would control the power of government.
Wealth is something people create. So of all your categories, only (2) makes any sense at all, at least in terms of being "wealth". Wealth is good and services created by people.

* statistical analysis of ring input selection by wallet
* paid collaborator data from exchanges is crucial
* poison sends
* spamming the chain with regular periodic self sends to seed dummies
* the fact stealth addressing exists at all - terrible concept
While these techniques are expensive, its easily afforded if you can resell the results to multiple state governments.
Monero only has a few k tx/day; one of the biggest weaknesses of this forest is the lack of trees. To hide, one needs hiding places.
Stealth addressing is a dumb idea. It provides a nice data aggregation point for attackers. It gives you a way to send poison money to someone and see what happens. It gives you a convenient way to organize for analysis. Its smarter to not use it and give a fresh never before used address; that way people can only send to you one time and have to ask your permission to send again.
Monero is not well thought out, top to bottom. You cant just slap a bunch of crypto toys together in a haphazard fashion and pretend that makes for security. Its the rain dance cargo cult model of security. Monero has become the biggest cuckoos egg in the space.

Maybe... but also maybe not. Slashdot is a venerable site. It was around for a long time, since the days when Perl was the only way to make a website. 
Those who were members and didnt move on are set-in-their ways types, of old casual leftists who didnt realize that free software was a capitalist movement. They have been left behind, technologically and ideologically. 
They are the old believers that the star trek future was space-communism, that big government can fix all the problems, and that individualism and liberty are evil, that money and work and trade were outdated relics of a savage time.
Bitcoin represents the opposite of everything they believe it. Its not some Darpa project from the bowels of big government. Its not marketed to them via CNN and direct mail. It doesnt promise to redistribute wealth or to censor dissidents, it doesnt even allow for such things.  Its not the moneyless startrek future of luxury gay space communism they were promised. Its the opposite brand of economics that they despise; the economics of merit and markets.
Bitcoin is pure capitalism. Its a grungy futuristic **money**, a mix of cryptography &amp; technology and libertarian economics which creates something that seems backwards to them: trade and markets and prices and business. 
Bitcoin makes no promises to fix the world, to save the unicorns, or make everyone happy all the time. Its just a tool, a money system. It has no prime directive or fancy marxist curtain of lies.
Its different than the future they expected, its doesnt match their marxism, and thus they hate it with every little fiber of their being. You dont need a bot net to make the slashdot crowd seem salty and ignorant; its just who they are. The higher it goes, the quieter they get, and the lower the louder and more emboldened they are.

If you use external Curl you could use external openssl as well.
If you link to an https client library such as openssl it already contains the code to handle x509. Some languages have x509 as a core built-in, and you cant even opt out. There is no new dependency in nearly any case I can think of.
How is this seen as a new dependency or a valid gripe? 


That's a fair point; but in theory they could do so. 


Ideally, it would not be the web server transport certificate, but instead a different certificate specifically for bitcoin invoices. 


I see; so you do see value in the features, but bip70 itself is a sunk ship.




I agree with the pure binary part. 
But I dont really see an alternative to the x.509 part. x.509 is not that large of a dependency; and there is not really any other system which allows for a hierarchy of 
"well known" public keys. Its just a pubkey + a signature with some ASN.1 metadata wrapping. There are no competing protocols available, and I think coming up with a new standard for key distribution is even worse.
Since any device or software which is going to participate in a web based protocol *must* support x.509 anyway, I really do not understand this particular gripe.  If someone publishes a web-api, you dont get mountain of complains that its too burdensome to support https transport. Its literally the most ubiquitous security protocol on the planet, and well within the capabilities of an embedded device.

While true, it certainly has a meaning. You can only borrow so much from your future self. 
To make a simple analogy; if a farmer stored grain to eat in the winter when he cannot grow food, he could certainly "borrow from himself" and sell some of his winter grain reserves to buy luxury items. 
If he does this too much, then he will eventually regret it.
When the government borrows from itself, the money is fake but the goods and services it moves are real. In this case, the government is eating up the winter grain of its people, in return for luxury goods of various types. If the government takes too much, the people will suffer.

This is the crux of his argument, and a telling weakness in his narrative. 
Undershooting the inflation target is far more indicative of an incoming currency crisis than high inflation. Fiat currencies cannot survive a deflationary event. Since the great depression rocked the entire world economy, never again would deflation be allowed. The central banks of the world will print money at any cost. And it will be quite a cost indeed, because the debt bubble and market distortions are at historic levels. And that cost will fall on the middle class and poor of the world via stagflation.
Once the money printing begins in earnest, people will naturally look for a way to opt out of shouldering the burden of the banker bail-out.

Well, the stock market is much longer lived and more well trusted.
But at an 8% return on average, it takes 9 years to double your money in stocks, while noone has ever had to wait 9 years for bitcoin to double in value. Depending on how you measure, bitcoin is returning 17%, so it doubles in value in only 4 years or so. But unlike stocks, bitcoin doesnt have over a hundred years of reliable track record.
Both for stocks and for bitcoin; buying in at a peak results in very suboptimal returns. It knocks up to a decade off your stock performance, and for bitcoin buying it could be a 4 year setback if you buy in at the peak. 
In both cases, steady regular investment is the safest. If your analysis of risk is strictly based on the past, you would naturally think bitcoin is riskier.

For small amounts of pocket change, a cell phone wallet is good enough, and much faster than futzing with custom hardware. That means any hardware wallet should be a good target for cracking open.
To leave the private key hot/loaded in a hardware device and ready to use with only a short PIN means you are trusting the device to be somewhat resistant to tampering.
So far, no device I have found provides the needed level of tamper resistance, so the only option that is viable is to keep the device completely blank, and restore the mnemonic for each use. That means the best wallet is the one that is fastest to restore, imo.

Well, if 16 Psyche was a normal rocky asteroid, for its mass it should have roughly 3.85 trillion kilograms of gold. 
But that is extremely pessimistic.
Considering that it is a differentiated protoplanetary core, it almost certainly contains gold and other heavy elements is much higher concentrations than the average of the whole solar system. Most estimates seem to be about 6 times as much for planetary cores. 
Its reasonable to expect that this one asteroid contains from 3 trillion to 64 trillion kg of gold.
For comparison, the current total amount of gold in human hands is roughly ~170 million to ~250 million kg. 
Even the most conservative estimates of asteroid gold abundance would make gold a very cheap metal - comparable to any kind of dirt.

I agree; some attempt should be made to maximize the combination set. 
The largest gaps in most join algorithms are
* they simply give up on making change sizes match, allowing change to leak all the join pairs
* They dont usually allow multiple inputs
A user providing more inputs should have to shoulder more of the fee. 
I would also break intention along these lines:
1. Consolidation of small inputs into one larger one
2. Breaking a large input into multiple smaller ones
3. A "perfect" spend
(1, 2) are common, because you will seldom have a perfect coin that matches what you need to spend. (3) happens mostly when tumbling/mixing/self spending so its usually a give away.  
Whether an output is a spend or not does indeed matter: with a send-to self its easy to provide more addresses and accept more coins. But with a real spend, you generally have on single address and it has to be one coin.
The other challenge is that the destination might be p2pkh or p2sh, which will stand out.  Afaik wasabi tries to keep the join pure p2w*, and allowing a mix of output types would make it harder to meet the minimum entropy requirements to complete a join.  (assuming the address family is counted when computing possible sources, and the rule for a join is that all outputs must have at least two plausible sources)

You are right that a system which steals from some and gives to others cannot be used by everyone. The real winners are hard-coded, and the fact that anyone else can edge in on the game has more to do with massive public unawareness, and crumbs falling through the cracks.
That said; if people were aware of this they would know that the dollar is non-viable and would seek to avoid it for savings, denomination, units of account, etc. They would demand pegs to gold, actual metal, bitcoin, real estate, physical shares in business (not in brokerage accounts but in hand) etc etc.
Just like you suspect, that would crash the dollar machine.

Hrm... I dont follow you. In C/C++ I link to openssl, dynamically on linux or statically link on a deficient OS.  In JS, its build into the core. In Python/Java I can use a pip/maven dependency. In pretty much any language I can think of this is a trivial issue; that said I dont use C# much so perhaps this is a C# thing.... The code needed to deal with x.509 is not particularly large.... it should be solvable in any platform. 


Thats pki... you've summed up the entire web of trust as "easy" when in fact its not really easy at all. Its a hierarchy of signatures of public keys starting from a few arbitrary trusted roots. Without this minimal structure, you have no particular method of distributing said "well known public key". X.509 is about as slim a solution as possible; and there are not any alternatives other than chucking the problem out the window...and at that point why sign anything at all.
I do appreciate your response Nicolas, but I am not convinced there is any better way to specify bitcoin receipts (or any receipt protocol) without the suggestion that the signature will be made by a public key which can be verified via the standard x.509 pki chain of trust.

Democracy (as in the voting system) is the logic of a gang rape. The many abusing the minority. It is inherently tyrannical.
The USA is blessed to be a Republic, with strong checks against unrestrained democracy. Ideally, we could become a full voluntary republic with no voting at all.
In a full voluntary republic, you are never forcible robbed, imprisoned, or injured simply because you are outnumbered. If a group calls for a vote on some topic, those who abstain or vote "no" should never be affected in any way by the outcome of the vote.
so if 9/10 neighbors vote to increase taxes, and you vote "no", then you should not have to pay the tax.

People who "buy low" or IOW "value investors" tend to have a blindspot: Just because something is cheap does not mean it is a good buy.
If Bcash is down to 10% of its peak, that is not a 90% discount if it is headed to zero. Its still a 100% loss of whatever you invest. You cannot make up for int in quantity, and it does not make any difference how cheaply you got in to the total loss.

Thats not the part that gets broken. I see no reason to expect the ECC will be broken, or that QC will ever be practical.


The weakest part is that the ring signatures dont create real joins; and you can extract information about which inputs are real vs which are dummy inputs. 
So unlike bitcoin tumbling, in which what you see in l1 is all the information, in monero there is a second layer of truth which can be mined out, and one that strips privacy bare. And once you get to a certain percentage of knowledge about the chain; you can maintain a near perfect de-anonymization of monero in real time due to the way dummies are selected. 
I recommend the "breaking monero" series to get you started on the basics of these techniques. 
In short; there is only one privacy game left standing among all cryptos, and that is still plain old coinjoin on bitcoin. Monero is a law enforcement honeypot at this point.

Also, a cutoff like $10 or $1 would help free up space for higher value data as the earliest days the price was as best theoretical and wastsing a third of the graph height on that help to make it look artificially flat.

It may well get back up to what you bought in at, I think it still has legs. 
That said, be cautious because alts do not have the same fundamentals as Btc. 
The currency market is inherently winner-takes-all, and that means that only one coin will hold value long term and serve as a "store of value" like a currency. 
Other coins may indeed have uses, continue to exist, and be profitable to mine. For example some people may enjoy the use-cases offered by eth's computing network. That function however does not require a valuation linked to the economy as a whole, only a valuation high enough to enable its functionality. 
So when buying alts, you are either speculating on a sudden bubble, or else buying them to immediately use/transmit/consume.
It would be a different story if an Alt displaced btc as the top coin, for example if LTC took the lead then it would have the best prospect for long term store of value.

In this specific case there is no nuance, and no balance of risk/reward. You are telling him to protect his assets by destroying them.
Bitcoin only will and only can have value if it is taken out of custodial wallets and into private control.
If bitcoin is regularly captured as a custodial asset, its no different than USD.  Bitcoin will fail in that case and deserve to fail. 
If bitcoin succeeds, then it will only succeed for those who have avoided custodial services. Those using custodial services, must by default cheat their customers. Regulatory compliance ensures that it must be so, that is the entirety of its true purpose.
We are talking about two fundamentally incompatible systems of control. The fight is not some ticker or symbolic orthogonal fight, with room for partial victories or shared success. This is a battle for the control of money via a diametrically opposite manner. 
Bitcoin puts control into a distributed network. Custodial fiat puts control into a central regulatory agency. 
They are absolute opposites, incompatible to the core.

If your nano device has a screen and buttons for control, then it might be safe enough. Make sure you never type your recovery words into windows, and always verify destination addresses using the screen. 
You should also strictly use native segwit + bech32, to prevent amount based attacks. (hardware wallets are only safe with native segwit transactions)
The idea of a hardware wallet is that you dont have to trust your computer so much. 
The biggest risk if you still run windows is that the destination address for payments will be switched. So if you try to buy something online, the address will be swapped out for a scammers address. So you wont get credit for the purchase and your money will be lost

It doesnt matter what the price trend is. If the dollar was going down instead then you might be able to claim capital losses instead. But since it is clearly rising, you owe for the gains.
Lets assume you bought your dollars at the beginning of the year. Your dollars are now worth 170% more BTC than at the beginning of the year
So each time you spend dollars, you have to report of gain of BTC.
And you owe taxes on the 10K satoshi per dollar gain. Buy a $1 soda at a vending machine; you have to keep the receipt, make an entry in your logs for the dollar-sale, and pay capital gains taxes on the 10K satoshi you gained. Since we are talking short term cap gains, that could be as high as 3.7 K satoshi.
If you make a 5000 dollar down payment on a car, and you owe the US government taxes for the 0.5 BTC gains, up to 0.185 BTC.
The dollar is practically unusable because of its reporting requirements and insane taxes.
Anyway - I hope this makes you see why the suggestion made by ron paul is absoutely correct. Currency should not be subject to taxation.

Is there evidence that miners are actually selling into the market? Based on the apparent price stability, it seems highly likely that at least some miners are doing speculative holding, because there simply arent enough places to buy BTH needed to sustain the price organically.  The rapid inflation rate and low market depth should have resulted in a massive dump, but it didnt.
And this explains the lack of drop in BTC prices, which would be expected if some BTC customers switched over organically and started buying BTH in lieu of BTC.
If a large BTC holder was liquidating their BTC in favor of BTH, then you would expect to see significant downward pressure on BTC, but its not happening. This could be OTC purchases directly from miners, or open market purchases on exchanges, but it is either a new non-crypto source of funding or else a huge investment by the miners themselves.
So it must be some combination of:
(A) Some Bcash miners are hodling BTH
(B) A whale is buying into Bcash from some fiat currency, and not liquidating BTC to do it.

If your RNG is later found to have less than perfect entropy, your private key can be computed from two signatures of the same key. This is how the PlayStation was hacked, blockchain.info web wallets were hacked, java based wallets were hacked, etc. you dont have to believe me until you lose all your money.
if you google blockchain forensics you can figure out that part on your own.
If you are aware of quantum cyptanalysis: the clock is ticking for decoding your private key from the first transaction sent from an address. If quantum computers become practical, then addresses which have never sent a transaction are not vulnerable. If the time till confirmation is less that the time to crack a key, bitcoin is largely unaffected; but anyone who reuses address remains vulnerable.

The very first thing in the bitcoin blockchain, the block that started it all, the genesis block contains a quote from a london newspaper. Bitcoin is a reaction to the banks not being safe places for money, and the money system itself not being a safe place for wealth.
This is a movement in reaction to the nation fiat fractional reserve currency system of the world. Bitcoin is going to replace the dollar, the pound, the ruble, the yuan, and every other national currency on the planet.

Thats not what it means; I mean that every sticker on every shelf in the USA has a price in dollars. Every contract or salary is in dollars. Its very hard to change that, and it grants a sort of artificial subsidy to the value of the dollar. 
So even in the face of hyperbitcoinization, there are still extremely strong moderating factors.
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:13:07


Its the same thing; there is a mental cost to change pricing, and a mental effect of seeing a price. The effect of supply and demand is gradual, and make take months to filter through a supply chain. But a sign on a shelf saying you can get a 6 pack of beer for $10 makes the $10 very real and gives a definite concrete valutation both in the mind of the shopkeeper and the customer. Even if the dollar is in free-fall, the price on the shelf is the source of the illusion which creates value.
The same goes triple for salary; its a stable and long term negotiated number which represents the value of a long term relationship; you cannot easily change this number with affecting the relationship; even when both sides agree its very unsettling to both. Salaries across the dollar sphere impart enormous price support for the dollar. 
One of the best things that could happen to our economy would be to end the employer/employee culture, and move to an all contractor style workforce.


I totally agree; I'm just saying there are compound reasons why that can be slowed or hampered. 
I think venezuela is a great case in point. Bolivares measurably deteriorates hour by hour. They are as bad a currency we have seen since zimbawe bucks. And yet it limps forward, failing to die. While bitcoin is valued in VZ, it hasnt been able to completely extinguish their fiat system. 
I do believe hyperbitcoinization is coming, but I think it will be a S curve, with a fast part in the middle, and a very long tail as fiat clings to life for ages. I do not think it will be a geometric curve with a hockey stick shape, for the reasons i stated.

Believing in gravity and entropy is not extremism. Like the nature of bitcoin those are simple facts. 
Bitcoin's supply cannot be altered to allow for monetary policy This means there is physically no way to apply keynesian economics to it. If bitcoin collapses that will follow precisely the keynesian predictions regarding the business cycle: 
Conversely, if bitcoin succeeds, that follows the austrian theory of sound money. Thats because bitcoin is a hard/sound currency, with a supply which is beyond human effort to change.

That comment makes no sense. 
Real estate only makes sense as an investment if you:
* buy it with leverage, at a very good interest rate
* rent it out for more than payments maintenance and taxes combined
* know how to extract earnings via leverage
* dont catch the wrong end of a bubble
* spend a lot of time researching and analyzing your purchase
* hold long enough to recoup transaction costs
* have good tenants
Real estate make tons of money for the industry, and is heavily taxed from all directions. The base level of risk and effort, plus the minimum viable level of investment needed means that bitcoin is a *much* easier investment, which requires nearly no effort in comparison. It has no chance of damage, and no cost for maintenance. It can be bought and saved in tiny amounts, and moved to anyplace on the planet with ease. 
I know many people who bought rental properties, spent tons of the free time on it, and after dealing with all the headches, damage, bad tenants, etc they barely have anything to show for it. Compared to people who DCA'd pocket change into bitcoin monthly, its rather night and day.

The bitcoin market is tiny enough that it matters whether or not they have loaded up or not.  As with gold or any large money type commodity, there is a size threshold where it becomes impractical to form a whale coalition. 
Bitcoin is not at that size, but the long term trend indicates it is 6 to 10 years from reaching such a point.  Assuming the environment remains unchanged, it seems inevitable.
Of course, a lot can happen in that amount of time. While the landscape has not really changed yet, it could change in a heartbeat. The only thing guaranteed in the market is the last settled trade.

I agree; rapidly rising productivity over the last ~10 years has been an amazing counterbalance to the rampant waste and malinvestment. 
If we are in a new paradigm; it would be one in which human science and technology is advancing so rapidly it outpaces the damage and ongoing drain of the credit bubble and allows us to limp forward into the future without a cleansing shakeout. 
Ultimately, there is a price being paid by allowing non-productive businesses to continue to operate unculled. The unknown is just exactly how much we can afford in the global economy. I think it is possible that a crash even could be forestalled for a very long time. 
Without an escape valve, or a brighter light, there is no particular reason the charade has to end. In the game of musical chairs; there are no losers if the music never stops. Bitcoin is like a chair off to the side; shrouded in dim light. It might be a way for the weary of feet to opt out of the dance. 


There are more factors that play here in the seeming lack of financial gravity: Gold has lost a lot of mindshare, and cash has become harder than ever to use in significant amounts. Offshore banking havens have been shuttered for most people, and thus there is simply no place for most people to run with their money.

You still fail to grasp the fundamentals ?!?!
Function transformations != entropy.
If I gave you a 5 exahash PBKDF2 miner farm, tell me how much it would speed up attacking an arbitrary bip39 wallet ?
5 exahashes are worth 60 bits, does that weaken the key by 60 bits?


A bank login password is not the same threat model at all, ymbj


This is false because you cannot exceed 256 bits of strength which arrive in the output: a secret key. those "11" bits in your estimation are actually 0.
PBKDF also has extremely fast asics, which can more than make up for any reasonable legitimate user wait time based on cpu devices. Those pbkdf rounds add exactly nothing to the strength of bip39; the entropy in the words is everything. Thats why they chose such a small round count - its perfunctory. Removing the whole step would have no impact on the system security.


No part of the spec for a hamburger can prevent you from ramming it up your bunghole - but thats obviously not how its designed to be used.


Noone does that, because no attainable amount of stretching is going to overcome the &gt; 40 bit gap an adversary would possess in compute speed. You either have enough computer generated entropy or you dont.


You are not going to save one single user. key stretching is just not part of the threat defensive model, period.

The usual hedging assets like cash, treasuries, and bonds become far less attractive in negative interest rate regimes. 
But real estate becomes more attractive; especially if you can get a mortgage at a negative rate. Getting paid to buy a house or investment property certainly improves the outlook for real estate. 
Of course; real estate is already drastically overpriced; so buying in now with a super cheap loan still puts you in the hole when the bubble pops.

Stocks are what you are hedging.


It doesnt matter; the credit cycle is caused by changes in the flow of money, not by changes in business. The operation of some businesses may actually benefit from a crash, but that doesnt protect their price. 
When you have a credit cycle crash (a recession) money moves out of stocks rapidly into cash, and then from cash into the void of debt settlement. This causes hard deflation which is most keenly felt on stock prices.
You also get collapses in real estate and commodity prices, sometimes. 


thats usually after the crash, not after a tiny dip from an all time high

Even withdrawing 100% of balances as cash would have very limited impact on the banks; its just paper after all, and they can print as much of it as they want, and devalue it at will. 
But if people are replacing their cash savings with gold, bitcoin, and similar commodities outside of the banking system, then the objective is achieved. Paper cash doesnt actually have to leave the bank at all; so long as your trade your balance away for some kind of solid asset or sound money, then the real effect of a bank run can take place.
Conversely, when stocks, bonds, treasuries etc are held, then those actually help the bank. In fact, holding those assets is even more favorable to the bank than holding cash in a bank account, since it keeps the asset bubble high and protects their debt bubble.
In short: 
* Dumping fiat for gold/btc = strong freedom effect
* Withdrawing cash = no effect / neutral
* Holding "bank money" in bank accounts = minor negative to freedom
* Buying stocks/bonds/real estate = counter productive to freedom

I think that is key. 
Bitcoin can probably reach 100k without the dollar necessarily weakening. But 1m per btc would mean 1 cent : 1 satoshi. The hypothetical value of btc arriving at ~17 trillion is very comparable to the dollar M2 which is only ~14 trillion now. 
Since the two are direct competitors, I expect the dollar would have to soften by 10% to 50% for this to occur.
I cannot see this being possible without some major international trade switching over to btc. If 80% of international trade and shipping was settled in btc, then 1mm usd per btc would be very realistic, with the dollar value slipping to 50% of its present buying power.

A wallet doesnt have a single private key. it has a series. So your key at index 0 is very likely to be outside of the UTXO set. Do you know which set it is in, and what the size is. Also, there are like ~5 popular derivation paths, and 4 common public key schemes, so multiply that number by ~20 unless you want to risk a failed investment.

Tether has been unbacked for a long time; this isnt even news. The funny part is that doesnt make it any worse than the dollar; in fact is still significantly better than USD. The reason is that USD in a bank is not backed either; so tether isnt really any different.
A dollar bank is only as safe as the group managing it, and the odds are good that bitfinex is stealing a lot less than the fed. The fed is stealing more than 25 times tether's whole market cap every month, after all.
So long as finex keeps the amount of free tether they award themselves modest, they should have no trouble at all maintaining a 1:1 parity to the USD.

tl;dr its a spill over side effect of negative interest rates.
There are organizations and investment funds which must buy bonds, regardless of yield, due to their charter. They still look for the best yield they can get. When all government bond yields are all deeply negative, then overpaying for a corporate bond becomes viable. 
They are not quite the same thing as negative yield treasuries. Government bonds with negative yields actually destroy money, while negative yield corporate bonds do not. So its really just spill-over from the government/bank bonds with negative yields, and nothing more. 
The core issue is negative bank interest and negative yield bank/government bonds. Those exist as a tool to try to force people to borrow and spend to keep deflation from happening, and to keep asset prices as high as possible. So long as incomes and asset prices stay high, then the debt bubble can keep inflating without popping, and the status quo can stretch on for a while longer.
This is mainly happening in europe for now. 
When banks buy negative yielding government treasuries, it lets them print money directly via government spending. (its a form of debt monetization). When pension funds and such buy them, they are concentrating the losses on their members instead of the public at large. When individuals or hedge funds buy them, they usually have insider knowledge and plan to quickly flip them on the other groups.
In short: negative interest is like a form of helicopter money: the banks make extra money, hand it to the government, which then puts it into circulation. The extra money flying around helps to keep prices high, and thus prevent an economic crash.
@_date: 2019-10-14 14:29:02




It doesnt work that way. When the government spends fiat, it has no need to be profitable or even break even. All government spending is inherently unprofitable, and if it is used for tax enforcement, then the loss is doubled: Its like chopping off your leg to make a meal. 
The reason they are willing to spend fiat is not to make a profit, its to discourage and prevent hyperbitcoinization. What they are afraid of is losing control. If fiat dies, so would most of their power.

Why? Look what student loans have done to education - the cost has gone up while the quality has not. Now you get to graduate with years of debt, where as before you could pay your own way through college on a party time job.
Consumer debt has no value to society. The only thing mortgages do is drive up the price of housing and rents, while shackling the people who live in houses with debt. 
Without the mortgage bubble, people who cannot afford a house could rent one and save up. Rent would be vastly lower, and house prices lower, so they could save more money over less time.
Fuck the hamster wheel of mortgages, that thing needs to die.

The seat of monetary authority is where the bank exists. 
It doesnt matter who established it, or how it is labeled "public" or "private", and whether or not its called "central". Those labels have no meaning, and are simply distractions, decorations, or historical curio. 
So long as the bank has power over the creation and destruction of money, it is the true heart of government and rules over the other branches. Power over the money allows a small elite group within the government, people who names you do not even know, to effectively rule over and decide all things of importance.

For someone to unravel it though is not that hard; a simple national security email or phone call will unravel one proxy roughly each couple hours. And you wont know its happening. And they have nearly unlimited time to do it.
If you are using some rooted box, all they need is an ISP wireshark to see in/out traffic, and they will have followed that link. Perhaps one or two hours.
See; the problem with mining is that you need to keep your farm in the pool for days/week/months. Hiding your identity when you have an extremely long lived chatty connections is very difficult to impractical, because you are giving an investigator nearly unlimited time to track you down.
A key part of the game of hide and seek is to stop screaming your own name out as loudly as possible. That means you cannot be mining.
Realistically, if you mine for 1 year over 9 proxies + tor, never spend a penny, sell your rig, then wait two years, it might, just might barely work out clean. But i would still tumble first because maybe not. Much cheaper and faster is to buy btc for cash then tumble it.

There always are because its limited by the intended recipients hardware; thats why key stretching only has value when the message sensitivity is bound by time.

zero useful information; in fact the article body seems to contain less information that the headline.
Fidelity is ramping up its cryptocurrency custody business, hoping to profit from the scarcity of big, regulated institutions in the chaotic world of digital assets, according to Abigail Johnson, the investment group’s chief executive.
The Boston-based financial group, which has $2.8tn of assets under management, announced the launch of Fidelity Digital Assets last autumn, promising “enterprise-quality custody and trade execution services” for hedge funds, family offices and financial advisers dabbling in cryptocurrencies.
Fidelity started adding clients in the first quarter and is now engaged in a full rollout of its custody and trading services for digital assets — a boon to what is a fragmented and complicated industry, Ms Johnson told the FT in a rare interview.
“If you’re either interested or technically adept, then it’s not really that big of a deal, but compared to everything else that you do in terms of financial relationships that you have with either a bank or a brokerage firm . . . it’s just more nascent. It’s just not developed.”
Ms Johnson, chief executive of the group since 2014, sees Fidelity’s cryptocurrency custody service as a big selling point, pointing to stories of thumb drives lost and holders passing away without sharing their digital keys with relatives. 
“There are people out there with significant amounts of wealth in cryptocurrencies, probably bitcoin, and they’re looking for somebody to hold those coins for them because in the event of their passing — which is going to happen at some point or another — you’ve got to have a plan to be able to get those coins to somebody else,” Ms Johnson said.
Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, already stores billions of dollars worth of digital assets on behalf of its customers. Last year it also launched its own custody business for third parties. But Coinbase “is still a company that most people had never heard of, and they don’t have the existing relationships with the independent advisers”, according to Ms Johnson.
Fidelity Digital Assets has filed an application to operate as a limited-purpose trust company with the New York State Department of Financial Services, which would enable it to serve an even broader range of institutions.
Fidelity’s experiments in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, were initially “just for fun”, Ms Johnson said. The company explored several potential avenues, even setting up a small bitcoin mining operation in 2014 that cost $200,000. 
“Some people in the finance department seriously raised their eyebrows at that,” she said. 
Eventually, Fidelity settled on custody as the best launching pad, encouraged by a number of requests from existing financial adviser clients that wanted to use the company’s infrastructure for their own customers’ cryptocurrency investments. 
Although there is still a lot of scepticism over cryptocurrencies in many corners of the financial services industry, Ms Johnson is confident that there is a valuable business to build in the field. “It’s not going away. As long as the value is there, people will look to preserve that value,” she said.

You are not going to be able to dispute a card present in person transaction with your credit card either. 
Being able to dispute online purchases with credit cards is a valuable feature; but for the most part that is because of flaws in how credit cards work.
That said; for the most part online returns and such are generally handed with the cooperation of the merchant anyway. The main reason credit cards need reversals is because you permanently lose control of your credit card when you make payments. Bitcoin just doesnt have that flaw.

Is it really that hard to understand the fundamentals underlying it? 
Bitcoin is a money competitor; a competitor for all the uses of currency. It has no other utility. We are all fairly familiar with its main upsides (permissionless, fast) and downsides (scale headaches, ramps). 
Its clear that during this last bubble, it changed from something most people had not heard of into something most people have at least heard of. Adoption is still measurably very low, security is still airtight, development continues at the usual snails pace, and regulation remains a mixed bag.
So in the big picture, very little changed. Just like the last cycle, a quick hype spike was followed by a long agonizing disillusionment phase. If it follows the same pattern, after a couple years people will be shocked when they hear "thats still around" and kick off the next wave.
No serious competitors have arrived, no new cryptographic landscape changes have happened. Not much has shifted really except the scope of brand recognition.

The block history is forever, and the monero blocks are not very full... handful of transactions per block. Secondly, you can sybil by adding some of those transactions your self. Third there are patterns, which can help you to distinguish between a mixin and inputs. Borromean rings only obfuscate the signing key directly - they dont prevent you from discovering it via side channels.
The only way to provide small windows of uncertainty is to perform a long series (10 hops + ) with a large set (10 + uncorrelated wallets) without touching an exchange, sybil, or other collaborator. Real coin joins would at least offer plausible deniability, but fake borromean mixins mean that once the fakes are eliminated you have absolute funds custody flow established. If monero blocks were a *lot* fuller, like thousands of tx per block, the difficulty and time to analyze could be raised significantly. 
In short: while monero may provide a temporary barrier to quick analysis, it is fundamentally inferior to normal bitcoin coinjoins. There is an infinite attack window open on a small dataset, with unambiguous knowledge at the end.

So what? Devaluation is the only way to "steer back to port" in this system


You dont understand how the debt cycle works. 
There is no dialing it down, deleveraging, or any graceful way to stop it. 
Its a run away train going down a steep hill, and the only way to keep it on the tracks is to keep increasing speed, or else to devalue the money.
There is a reason why we have had semi-regular recessions and crashes so long as the Fed has existed: its a system of mass theft.
The damage has already been done, we just havent felt the fallout yet. 


And this is the key part: hoping doesnt matter at all. Our collective individual actions will lead to what they lead to.
The people who will suffer the most are, to a certain extent, the people who bear the most blame for the problem in the first place. Ignorance and blind trust have a price, and the bill is due.
The exploiters at the top of the banking cartels will be fine; after all they are smart and understand how money works. Bitcoiners will also likely be fine, to some extent.

The monero blockchain is a permenent record, so separation of mixins from real inputs has been figured out by many analysts. This removes the join/mixing source of anonymity and allows funds flows to be analyzed. Of course, altcoin exchanges provide starting information to link the source of funds address (say bitcoin) to the initial monero address, and vice versa. This way it becomes easy to detect people who do short hops via monero and re-withdraw. (its a completely useless tumbling method)

The real shining phase for bitcoin is not the economic crash.
Bitcoin will likely go down (in USD terms) during a crash along with everything else. (because whats really happening is the dollar is rising hard). This phase is very short; because dollar deflation is very unstable.
The time for bitcoin to shine is the recovery phase when the fed tries to "fix" the crash. Thats when dollar inflation is happening, and its a long climb; a perfect time for bitcoin to rise.

Deleveraging can happen with even 0% interest rates.
Low interest rates dont fully prevent recessions, but QE does seem to delay them. 


They pay off debts because they dont want to be kicked out of their homes, or lose their cars. If their incomes decline, they still service their debt, and they start selling off assets to do it.


It seems like QE, monetization of the 2 year treasury, and general monetization of government spending are what we have planned. There are generally asset price supports, a specialized type of helicopter money designed to limit runaway inflation.
I suspect the Fed would prefer not to enter stagflation ever again. If trades wars were to expand, its not impossible that we could see the kind of environment stagflation thrives in, but I doubt it will be allowed to develop, because the fed can react to it and stop it fairly easily.

Yes. The additional words reduce entropy. The set of valid english sentence is simply much smaller than the set of random words. 


you can have an infinite length string with zero entropy. In particular, human additions, modifications, tweaks etc are all going to remove entropy. If you want more entropy, have a machine generate more random words - never take human created entropy.

Imagine having to type in your passphrase; are you going to have a program laying around that performs all those rules, or are you going to perform a sha hash by hand ?
Your intuition on this is a reminder why armchair cryptography is so treacherous. I recommend instead of your own intuition, trust the brilliant people who designed this stuff. The bitcoin core team are world-class cryptographers, and this is one of the hardest problem domains. The people who designed this stuff know their shit; and second guessing them is foolish. 
You are trying to morph an extremely simple system with a trivial to memorize passphrase and turn it into an operational nightmare with vastly reduced entropy. You would be better served by simply memorizing your mnemonic as it was designed to be, and doing exactly none of the things you propose.
If you insist upon making a rube goldberg mountain of goofy security faux pas, please stop posting them to me. Are you that terrified of mnemonics? I wonder when you will realize that bip39 random word mnemonics are 1000x easier to memorize than your pile of rules and corrections.

The are the mostly likely to have held a coin at one time. They are also the most likely to have been spent and be empty. You will miss the majority of wallets with this technique. 
the set is the set of al addresses that have ever been funded. the number of lookups per private key is roughly 10-20 for the commons wallets; and you can contain the size of the entries to 20 bytes by ignoring multisig and discarding the full script body.

The real entropy is a time/space cost. It is the size of the search space. The key stretching is purely functional. 
For example: 
* in a system with 2 possible passwords (1 bit) and extreme key stretching (40 bits) how hard is it to guess the password? 
* Do you think is it 41 bits of strength ?
* In a system with 256 bits of random password entropy, but 0 bits of key stretching, does the lack of stretching cost anything?
* What level of stretching can secure a 10 bit password for the age of the universe ?
* What level of entropy can secure a password for the age of the universe, even with 0 bits of contemporary stretch?
Do you see the difference between them yet?
In cryptography with unbound time, any functional operation cost can be reduced to a trivial cost.


The reason it is not; the practical amount of bit strength you can gain from stretching (~10 bits) is less than the asymmetry between the attacker and the defender (~40 bits), especially when compounded by time (~1 bit of stretching decay per ~2 years). This puts a hard cap on how much time stretching can buy. 
Therefore, for the bitcoin long term storage; any reasonable level of stretching will leave only the real entropy left as a defense. A fast trivial pbkdf is just as good as an obnoxious overconfigured scrypt. 
You are not going to use a level of stretching that makes you wait multiple days or months to unlock your wallet. So unless you periodically sweep your wallet over to a new one with contemporary stretching, the old assumptions about what is crackable go away.
The people who want key stretching to substitute for entropy are on a fool's errand. 


That is a different threat model.
For a password hash file - stretching has value; very often you know when a password file has been leaked. Salt also prevent rainbow table attacks.
They buy you time to rotate passwords and lock accounts. Much of that time is the logistical time for the attacker to procure his cracking system, more than any meaningful gain from stretching itself.
Even with the extreme key stretching systems, eventually the low entropy passwords all get cracked as stretching decays. Any password below 12 bits of real entropy will get decoded over time. By then hopefully you would have rotated the password so it no longer has value.
The obvious answer is to mandate high entropy. If all users were assigned computer generated passwords with at least 80 bits of entropy; none would get cracked in our lifetime even with a fully offline attack.

I would agree; Hardware is not the point here at all. If a daemon is in charge of signing, it doesnt matter whether it has the raw keys or controls some bit of hardware.
That said, It should be possible to separate the key-holding and signing functions to a separate service, one that can cross-verify the contents of the activity being signed. 
It would need to access to similar datastores but would otherwise be walled off from the main LN infrastructure and website. For example, for a receive only LN node, it would be able to refuse any request to send money out. So even if the web site and LN host were fully compromised, the signing host could block a withdrawal attempt.

You mean in the sense that you can earn money by risking capital? That is not much like proof of stake beyond a superficial sense. 
Automatically awarding hot wallets for doing nothing is not at all the same as rewarding online service providers who are providing liquidity to enable transactions. LN liquidity providers are offering a public service, and they compete to offer the lowest fee (some perhaps even offering negative fees in some cases) 
Overall lightning does not secure the network or offer proofs of anything: its just a cryptographically trustless way for people to collaborate to save money on L1 fees and get faster confirmations. Most people will use LN to save on tx fees and get faster confirms. Some people offer assistance to make LN possible in return for a fee smaller than what LN provides. Its not stake grinding anymore than operating an exchange or mixer is.
So, in short this really has nothing to do with proof of stake at all, beyond that fact that they both require hot funds.

From everyone else's point of view, they paid a fair price for it. From their own point of view they overpaid. Its not a public good; its a market good.

That is not a denial of someone the opportunity to eat the steak; because they paid for it on the market, their use is just as valid. 
The problem with bcash people is that they dont understand markets. 


The goal of the network is security, stability, resistance to disruption, decentralization, cryptographic strength, etc; those cannot be compromised no matter who is being alienated. 
It is nearly inevitable that to stay secure, a good portion of users will be alienated from L1; simply due to the nature of the algorithm.
Nakamoto consensus doesnt scale to billions of daily participants, period. There will have to be an ecosystem build on top of it, while it functions as the final base settlement layer.


This sounds like gavin's fud. Apologies in advance im going to be frank:


Bcash is a puddle of effluvium; has no security to speak of, development is a tragedy run by the unqualified, and even if bcash had any chance of success their design would explode faster than eth. 


That is the nature of the game; crypto currency, and money in the main, is a network; One protocol will win and all the others will die off and become irrelevant. 
The reason people are so vile to bcashers and alcoiners in general is that they are seen as parasites; scammers preying upon the innocent with smoke and mirrors.  The actions taken by the major pusher of bcash have demonstrated that even for those who cannot follow the technology debate.
I have not seen a single altcoin yet that had the vaguest interest or benefit. Its been a parade of anti-technologies.

It absolutely contributes to the value of BTC. It may be relatively small in absolute effect due to socialism shattering their economy, but it still has a measurable impact. 
The vast majority of their smaller everyday transactions can be offline, and fewer of enough force or magnitude to merit position on the main chain, but that is okay if not desirable even. 
If I were to send you a 100 satoshi tip, that does not merit an eternal enshrinement on the L1 main chain by hundreds of thousands of computers around the world; that is absurd. 
For smaller everyday transactions, a global ledger is just not the right way to go. When the value of the transaction itself is a tiny fraction of the reputational value of the custodial service, then in incentives are aligned.  The entirety of modern capitalism is built on temporary trust backed by ultimate delivery. 
Any custodial service can and will ultimately be put to the test by being asked to provide a real withdrawal; and it cannot be faked or inflated.


Windows XP user are mostly affecting themselves; it does not impose a global permanent irrevocable increase in bandwidth and storage on all operating systems. Also, they are not paying a contionuous tax for failing to upgrade. its not a good analogy.
Eventually, economic pressure will encourage nearly all bitcoin users to upgrade. And they will. 
At the same time, our use of the existing space will continue to improve, and marginal users will continue to be booted over to L2 or even custodial usage. This is a slow process, but necessary for proper growth.


blocks should be 100% full all the time. Block space is a precious resource; and the economic pressure will push the ecosystem to improve. 
its clear that the bcash approach is wrong; they are simply creating a brainless timebomb. 
I do agree that eventually a block througput increase will be needed, I just dont think it is quite so urgent as you seem to think.

Sure it does; every country has a way to deal with very small values. In the US, we use cents, and sometimes even fractions of a cent. 
In many places, they typically work in units of 100 or 1000 of the base currency, instead of using a cent type fractional system. 
The interesting part is that bitcoins smallest fraction, which is a whopping 8 digits down, and was originally such a vanishingly small amount, has instead become a meaningful amount of money in comparison to many real world currencies. 
Its still small, just no longer so trivial that it was far beneath even the smallest currencies.

Gold is simply too inconvenient - it doesnt travel over electrons, its heavy and bulky, its difficult to assay, etc. Plus, a small enough amount to be convenient for small purchases would be near dust size, youd have to trade with tweezers - meaning its only really useful for quite large purchases - purchases large enough to merit an acid test and ring test. It could take hours of driving and testing to settle it safely. Gold is impractical.
Due to all those reasons, gold has mostly been replaced with imaginary gold that only exists inside of computers. It turns out to be quite a bit easier to mine that the real metal too, so the price is quite a bit lower than if people only traded it metal in hand.

I agree;  Silver, and to an extent gold, have lost value because they have mostly lost their "moneyness". Perhaps it makes perfect sense for silver to have fallen in value by 7.5 times, regardless of any other prices. 


You can ignore silver here though and just compare yearly salaries and reach nearly the same conclusion; that in terms of labor the pound is 1000 times less valuable today.
Of course I'm assuming that the value of labor is roughly constant. Of course the modern laborer of today is vastly more intelligent, skillful, and productive than the laborer of 300 years ago. 
However, there are a lot more laborers today than there were 300 years ago. 
But on the other hand, the modern laborer has a much higher standard of living... 
Its really hard to directly compare since there are no constants. 
But clearly, if you had a receipt for 100 GPB drawable on the bank of england, you would have done well to spend it 300 years ago rather than save it until today. 300 years ago it was 5 years salary, today perhaps a nice dinner.

Consider this also; the voters are never given a real choice. The list of *who you can vote for* is careful catered to ensure that it does not matter much which candidate wins. The entire process and theatre of elections is designed to engage as many people as possible to feel like they have a say or stake in what happens, but without giving them any real stake or say. Emotionally charged issues which cannot change the nature of society much are always the focus. 
Perhaps it does finally come down to intelligence or awareness; a voter base of deeply aware philosophers would quickly abandon the process of democracy and establish a voluntary society. But that is simply unrealistic. 
A more realistic approach is to look at the forces which shape society, and drive real choices.

The ground truth is the price; its the only number which illustrates the real balance between the demand for savings vs spending in btc.

These technical indicators are positive for the health of the network, but they dont prove anything about if or when the price of bitcoin will go up.

If a certain type of mistake or attack is performed, it can be. A single private key compromise can unravel an entire bip32 subtree. This can be as simple as defective entropy, or even a subtle alteration of firmware. while 6979 + fresh addresses for each spend makes you immune.


Then why not leave it at that? Why the desperate defense of the bad practice?

You can spam zero fee transactions easily. If you make lots of zero fee txs just for the purpose of talking points, its certainly spam. Near dust transactions with a very very low fee are also also sometimes used to spam.
Fee's rising a bit is the solution, so its a self solving problem, and not something to be worried about. People with crappy wallets or service which overpay for the TXfee subsidize this behavior. 
People who can batch or delay tx's never really pay the higher fees. So the incentives are lined up for those who do pay the inflated fee costs to figure out how to avoid it to save money.

I think protocol buffers was primarily to have a deterministic block to sign; json being too flexible in terms of layout allows bugs and flaws that could be exploited with funky whitespace or sorting.  That said, a custom binary format like bip174 specifies would arguably have been simpler overall than introducing a goofy library like google protobuffers, which isnt really for this purpose.
Regarding PKI; I'm not sure why this is a negative. The wallet software needs to support PKI to retrieve the payment request in the first place.  Since web based commerce relies completely upon PKI for its security, and there isnt really any alternative, why not reply upon PKI ?  
Adding a signature to the request does offer some benefits, for example you wouldnt be able to spoof payment requests via redirection, echo urls, user posted content, etc. For the purposes of a receipt, it would stand alone as **proof** that the requested destination address belongs to the merchant, for example if suing for a refund that the website claims it never received payment. Without the signature, its not a receipt. 


I feel it is worse, cryptographically. 


BTCpay server doesnt interoperate with competitors, it interoperate with wallets. So the question is really how many wallets support it. And who cares what bitpay does, they are a cooked goose. 
But these features seem very important to me:
* allowing wallet users to receive a cryptographically signed receipt for their purchase which proves what item they bought and that the destination bitcoin address belongs to the merchant. This is a huge gap in direct bitcoin payments, since there is no third party like a credit card company, which acts as a notary for the transaction. 
* Automation of refund addresses. Merchant can easily refund credit cards if they cannot complete the transaction for what ever reason, but you cannot and should not send btc back to the source script, have have to ask the user where they want their refund sent. this means a proper sale would have multiple steps for a user, and slow down btc sales, or else risk needed an expensive customer service process for exceptions.
* Forward compatibility with new script formats not understood by the wallet. This would have made the bech32 upgrade seamless if it was more common. its too bad bip21 didnt have a rawscript option from day1
I feel like all of these features are important for making a proper enterprise consumer grade payments system, and to scale well into high volume sales. Right now, completely ignoring and disregarding bitpay, wallets support this spec and it achieves most of the goals. (it would be nice if it had a structured json invoice listing rather than a freeform memo field which is never used well)
Its the only system which gives a consumer an attested receipt which proves the address belongs to the merchant or processor. (Ive had bitpay deny that they controlled an address back in the early days, but bip70 was not used so i couldnt prove it)
Anyway, thanks for the response.

I thought it was a good thing at first, but bitpay has really ruined it. 
Since they got bought out by judas, theyve really just become an evil despicable company. Its too bad because they started out good. 
Their leadership were idiots though; they spent 1million dollars on a pointless superbowl ad, and got robbed of a million by a low effort spearphish. There is really nothing their engineers could have done to prevent their leadership from being idiots. With all those mounting losses, they probably sold cheap to judas. 
Bip 70 was originally a good thing, to make up from the rawness of direct bitcoin transactions.  After they become evil, bitpay started trying to add privacy invasion extensions to it, and then they made it so that it was mandatory for all payments with no fallback to a normal direct pay address.

The iron age was surprisingly incremental. For most of it, iron was a cheaper substitute for the superior prestige metal, bronze. 
Until very very late in the iron age, when steels were being reliably produced, iron was kinds of weak and overweight compared to bronze. The main advantage was that it was cheap.  You could lump the iron age in with the bronze age an not lose much imo.
The renaissance/age of exploration was a much bigger deal than that; So was the invention of fire; which actually altered human genetics significantly. The invention of spoken/written language perhaps. The invention of agricultural is a maybe; because it was invented over and over in many places independently it may have been more of an effect than a cause.
Whether or not bitcoin can exceed those or not depends on many things. If bitcoin can end government as we know it, then yes, it would be nearly unprecedented in history, at least the equal to the above things. And the cause/effect is quite easy to trace.
If bitcoin somehow leads to an of exploration/expansion into space, then yes, it would be the most significant event in the history of humans by far. But its less clear how direct the cause/effect would be here.

I would say the price of silver has fallen quite considerably.
An average worker's salary was between 20-30 pounds sterling in 1700. 
25 pounds of silver is worth 3666 GBP. The modern average salary in the UK is now 27600 GBP. That means silver in 1700 was about 7.5 times as valuable.
So if silver is 7.5 times less valuable than it was 300 years ago, and the British pound is 200 times less valuable in terms of silver than 300 years ago, that implies that the British pound is 1500 times less valuable over 300 years. 
Thats a pretty steep drop.

All stocks in your 401k are paying taxes continuously on all their revenues. 
Also, you are assuming that bitcoin is only acquired via a tax burdened salary, and not by trade or as business income, which do not suffer in the same income tax burden. Trading existing assets is not a taxable event. Creating money via debt to purchase bitcoin does not create a taxable event. And business income, while taxable, may be reduced or avoided by normal costs of doing business. (essentially any source of funds flow other than a salary is much more beneficial, and not just for bitcoin)
Also, 401k cash-outs will always pay income tax inevitably, with no possible path for significant legal avoidance. Bitcoin spending may not incur any tax at all in some hypothetical situations, such as if the amount is less than $600, or if your have changed citizenship, etc.

Inflation works differently than NIRP. 
The traditional counter to deflation is to create new money. That money has to be injected into the economy somewhere, and circulate around for a while to cause the money to devalue. Problems include the fact that inflation-spending is distortionary, and it doesnt always spread around evenly. QE is an example of this; it boosts asset prices and counters deflation. However, QE also leaves the government holding assets, which it must eventually sell or it eventually ends up owning everything.
NIRP works very differently. Its a direct and immediate loss of nominal value. It makes holding dollars in a bank account extremely undesirable. Everyone tries to spend more quickly. Since you dont have to print any new money, the spending is less distorted than inflation spending. It will be biased towards investments, since people dont really want to consume more. 
The boosted asset prices make for more collateral, which allows the credit cycle to continue. This is precisely the goal, because people pulling out of investments into cash is what causes the debt machine to lock up into deflation. therefore NIRP directly counters deflation. 
The downsides to NIRP are: well it makes your money seem bad even to the dullest individual. Most people have trouble understanding inflation, but negative interest doesnt fool anyone.  Second, people dont always flee to the overprices assets you want them to go to. If they buy overpriced stocks and bonds, then it works well. But if they resort to gold or bitcoin, then it could lead to dollar destabilization as people simple treat gold or bitcoin as money instead of dollars.
For those reasons, I doubt NIRP will ever happen - at least not to average consumer bank accounts. It would be a dream scenario for bitcoin.

I get it, i think it is a good thing and it already makes sense. Interactive invoice templates area very nice feature.
That said it would be nice to get a clean trustworthy bip70 option in there. 
Having a nice way to get a refund address from the user without the user having to do lots of extra work is nice. BIP70 also lets you upgrade the user to segwit even if their wallet doesnt directly support it which is a nice benefit - since you send the pay-to-script to the user instead of an address.
Refund address request automation, and pay-to-script are really huge benefits which are missing from most bitcoin payment sites, and are worth rescuing from bip 70. (and of course leaving out the bitpay extensions and nonsense)

u/NicolasDorier, ignoring bitpay completely,  and only considering wallets already compatible with bip70, it does seem to offer some nice minor benefits. 
specifically, 
* allowing automation of refund address provision rather than requiring multiple steps by the user
* allowing the user to pay to something other than an address; since it is a full destination script the user's wallet doesnt have to understand the destination (for example, a non-segwit wallet could pay to a bech32 destination)

The majority of listed stocks on the stock market are only able to survive because of government granted privileges. They are highly inefficient and very bloated entities. Ideally, it would all go away, and be replaced with something better. Perhaps smaller, more competitive businesses.
Bitcoin would help draw money out of the stock and bond markets; because it would function like an alternative method of savings.


Well, hopefully we end nearly all consumer debt; and only create debts of the productive kind. Massive reduction of waste, an and to the cycle of boom/bust, and overall a radical increase in productivity for society, would be what I expect.


I disagree; I think vapid consumerism is a natural response to inflated prices, radioactive currency decay, and easy access to consumer debt. A natural level of consumption must continue; people will still want food, a place to live, entertainment, etc. But artificially heightened levels of waste consumerism do not need to exist. 


I see bitcoin as a way out of the current economic system. It will allow us to return to a deflationary/sound money economy, without losing all the convenience of electronic payments and modern technology. 
I would expect reduced war and conflict, increased freedoms, decentralization, reduced pollution, and acceleration of the progress of technology. When people see bitcoin as an "investment opportunity", I feel like there are missing so much.

There is a safe way: never leave more funds outstanding at once than you are willing to lose. $2500 isnt terrible; but depending on how badly you needed the funds I generally recommend staying under $500 total funds on an exchange at one time, and withdrawing ASAP as soon as your exchange is completed.
$500 to learn that an exchange is exit scamming is far less painful than $2500. 
Dealing with a regulated fiat exchange is a lot like dealing with a shady criminal type; never trust them an inch more than you must, and avoid them entirely if you can.

Those criticisms apply to fraction reserve economies and not to sound money economies. 
Deflation is deadly to a fiat economy. 


No, saving is a positive thing. Inflationary economies react poorly to swings in money velocity, but that has no bearing on sound money economies. In a sound money economy, saving in the source of all capital, and thus the source of all economic progress.
Inflationary economies must penalize savings, but that is a flaw and not a benefit.

I agree that is a real issue; it would be a better state of affairs if there were dozens of high security server side wallets to choose from, rather than a handful of atrocious ones.  There is very little money in wallet coding, unfortunately.
That said, basic sanity is not so hard, imo


IMO using tor for the broadcast, coin control, transaction forming, tracer blocking, and never reusing addresses; this is a basic but strong level for a small site, and super trivial to implement.
A spy user will have to sign up for your service to start labeling your wallet for chainanalysis.
For any service large enough to be noticed and directly attacked, running a bit of tumbling or coinjoin becomes necessary. I think this is necessary for any large/professional organization, and also not that hard to do. With a touch of mixing into the casino wallet, chain analysis should have a very hard time. 


I agree with that, p2ep is going to be a great way to close the loop on the full flow. Sadly, client support is quite lacking, and will be for a long time. This is not the most important think however.
More important in the short term is payouts; if all payments were batched multiple-payouts with CJ's that would do far more for wallet privacy that p2ep, imo.

Has always been a stupid one. Would you "back" corn with wheat? why not just let each money be what it is. The idea of fixing scraps of paper to gold is no smarter than fixing gold to silver, or apples to oranges. 
The fact that gold has a physical commodity aspect is what killed it as a currency; despite all the graft and theft and other nonsense attached to government issues fiat note, it still outcompeted metal coins on plain merit; in just the same way to bank money is slowly but surely outcompeting paper cash in most niches. 
I know you dont dwell on that point, but i always cringe at mentions of "backing" because it is a doomed process.
I largely agree with the rest of the article; MMT's theory of how the state has some role in money is incorrect on a fundamental level. The only source of value for money is a shared illusion; when that illusion breaks government has no power to force people to accept its desired illusion. 
But, this is why Venezuela is such a fascinating experiment. VZ people do have access to BTC and USD to varying degrees. Hyperinflation has been ongoing for years, and yet the government has not collapsed and the system has somehow managed to continue to exist as its economy has spun down to a near standstill. The despot Maduro has managed to keep control over the monopoly on violence despite ruining just about everything nice in his fiefdom.  
The average person in VZ is now at a lifestyle comparable to that of a gulag. And yet; no final collapse. No explosion of freedom. Despite losing value faster than a grenade with the pin out, the Soberano is still used as a daily currency across the country. It would seem like proof that with sufficient control over the people, money alone will not set them free.
Most countries are nowhere near miles of VZ's level of monetary waste. And does that mean that the major economies of the world have a lot of room to safely indulge themselves in MMT, while the average person becomes more and more a willing slave, using whatever scrip is given to them?

How do you measure that? If you are using market cap, I would say thats an even less significant measurement that the single unit test.


The US M3 is roughly 14 trillion USD. If ~4M btc are lost, and 17M mined, then we have a standing supply of ~13M, iow it would be at par with the US money supply if you assume a naive equivalence through simple "market cap". I dont think this is super significant however, because bitcoin's "market cap" could be raised to many times this value with a much smaller amount of USD, because the USD demand to market cap multiplier is perhaps as high a 20x, and could be even more pliable with control of an exchange, or with fake USD such as tether in play. 
Of course, the USD supply is flexible, always growing, while the value of a USD is always shrinking. So its not a fixed target. 
the real question in my mind is at what USD price does bitcoin break USD; by causing a chain reaction of value destruction.  I have a gut feeling 1 million USD is close to that point; and the "price" of btc would reflect more the fall of the dollar than increased valuation for btc.

This part is correct; partially. So long as noone starts taking "coinbase credits" or 'baakt bits' in exchange for real BTC, there isnt any more in real btc circulation. 
And that is the key reason why bitcoin cannot be so easily fractionally reserved, because the cost of trust is exposed. Noone is going to pay the cost of trust in exchange for nothing if they arent forced to.
With the dollar; there is no way to get real hard dollars; they dont exist. You are forced to pay the cost of trust and the tax of inflation. All dollars are a soft and mushy and unbacked as any IOU. So there is no reason to discount "bank of america bucks" vs "chase bank dollarydoos", because neither of them is sound, and both with devalue the same.

This is incorrect; Gresham's law only applies to distortions caused by government on the money supply. 
There is a key part missing from that: 


When the government overvalues a given currency; it gets removed from circulation. 
This doesnt apply to bitcoin at all for a number of reasons.
* The government cannot force citizens to undervalue or overvalue bitcoin; it is not legal tender nor a federal reserve note
* bitcoin cannot be removed from circulation; it is not centrally issued
* Bitcoin has its own denomination, and circulates raw: it is not used like a gold standard to back promissory notes

Its possible; but you are still thinking about it in terms of bitcoin changing when its not about bitcoin in this case. 
The dollar spikes **hard** when deflation hits. Everyone is selling everything they own to get dollars, then the dollars are destroyed. Supply drops fast and demand goes through the roof. 
BTC would be expected to drop (in dollar terms) because the value of the dollar  and demand for the dollar itself force it to.
For example; if you were laid off from your job, and could only cover your rent by selling some btc to get your rent paid, would you do it ?
Your mortgage and/or rent being denominated in dollars is what gives that gravity field to the dollar demand. Debt is like negative dollars, and when you pay that rent the dollars disappear and cease to exist. The dollars you got for selling your btc in this case are gone, burnt away.
Unless the recession is too mild to matter; BTC almost has to drop at first while the spiral kicks in.
That said; its entirely possible that BTC will go up to match and thus prevent the USD price from falling. I cant wait to see what happens.

In so far as all money is a vessel for speculation, yes. Its already superior to most fiat currencies for this; they have a proven track record and an overt policy of decline in value, while bitcoin has a proven track record of appreciation and a fixed supply.
Consider the stock markets and real estate are overvalued, there is no better place to harbor money now than bitcoin.


Its money, in the purest sense. 
There are no laws to force it, no illusions of commodity intrinsic utility, or even decorative purposes. Its money for money's sake. Yes, its backed up with some technological bits, but those are just details.


Imagine being able to hold a billions pounds in your memory. Imagine a world wide borderless money that works anywhere there is internet, and is subject to no government. Imagine being able to fully own an asset that no one else can casually take from you against your will the way they can confiscate or devalue your bank account balance or your brokerage account.

I agree, but for completely opposite reasons. You are just giving a big rant on volatility.  A hodler does not fret about volatility, and day traders playing games with it will lose out.
There is a reason to avoid paying with sound money however, which is completely different. 
So long as you have access to fake money credit, and the seller will accept fake money, it only makes sense to buy hard assets like a house with fake assets like a mortgage. The bank will literally print up the fake money from thin air at the moment of purchase, and so you are getting a house in exchange for an inflationary debt. 
This means you can buy a house, and still keep your btc, while simultaneously increasing the upward price pressure on your btc by diluting the dollar. 
When the dollar loses value (which it will over 30 years) then your debt decreases, while your btc holdings continue to appreciate. This is a much better situation than having spent the btc.
The time to buy houses with BTC will be when fake dollars are not accepted and btc is all they will accept.

I think there is a utility for zero fee. Like you said they are non-problematic. There are occasionally bits of free space in a block during lulls.

* The dollar is under pressure from china and russia, who are working to bypass its use in the oil trade: 
This could result is a very sudden drop in the dollar's buying power.
* Work force expansions are ending (gender, age) 
 
* this leads to 
This will continue to provide strong inflationary pressure, driving the dollar's buying power down even further.

A transparent lie; they can "physically deliver" to the custodial account of anyone who can participate in options purchases. 
If an options gambler does not want to take physical delivery of bitcoin, or wants to withdraw dirty fiat, they can easily sell any delivered BTC.
I suspect the real reason here is to allow shorters to short BTC without the lender ever having had to buy in or hold any.

@_date: 2019-04-30 17:54:04


Nothing published open source as of now, but there are various closed impls.
The transactions should stand out just fine.  &gt;=2 inputs, and &gt;=2 outputs which match either the inputs or output sizes. 


The net benefit is still there, imo. What upside is there in leaving sudoku information laying around? When you return the change as one chunk, you leave a clear trail which is at least equivalent to the worst case sweep you described.


The biggest question is how may extra outputs get created, and when to give up and just make uneven change.  My gut instinct is to not allow any uneven change until you approach the txfee/coordination fee level. (and even then, try to round those to be even with the outputs if possible) But that may require too many costly outputs. 
Also, equal output sizes are not the only goal; there is value in having output sizes  match input sizes, where possible. Failing that, even multiples.
You would agree that the perfect join would be N inputs and N outputs all of the same size M sats, right? It merges the coin histories without adding any additional information to analyze.

Except it hasnt. USD in a bank arent backed, why does tether need to be ? Tether is actually trading above bank-backed USD, because its more useful.


Unfortunately, to be a stable coin it must be centralized. A decentralized asset cannot be pinned to a centralized one. Decentralized currencies float at their own value, just like bitcoin does.
A stable coin must be centralized by someone willing to always buy and sell it near $1. Generally it must be an exchange which is also centralized. The stablecoin is traded at par to start, and the exchange is obligated to defend that value. Whether it is hedged or backed in any way is less important than their willingness to defend its value.
Since fiat generally loses value over time, this is easy to do, and backing is not necessary.
Thats why tether isnt dying.

It doesnt work with roads, it wont work with the blockchain. Measuring the appropriate size for the blocksize is as simple as network bandwidth, CPU speed, memory Speed, and disk throughput. 
When the average of those numbers goes up, then the appropriate blocksize goes up. Market demand is completely irrelevant to the setting. 
Exactly like GP told you: the extra space will create extra demand, in the same way that extra lanes on a highway creates extra traffic. Blocks will fill up, fees wont reduce, and we are back where we started with more spam and fewer good nodes. Its lose/lose.
Blocksize should only increase when the technology fabric calls for it. We need to let the fee market distinguish when traffic is legitimate and which is spam, by pricing the spam out.  
If we go nuts like btrash, well get ultra low value spam like satoshidice, or services which store jpegs on the blockchain.

Because they are no worse than actual fiat shiatcoins.
It turns out that an asset which can be printed out of thin air, and can be arbitrarily seized at any time both by a centralized organization and any number of child organization under them, is no better than a random stableshitcoin pegged to it.
Pretty much anyone can create a Tether on a private exchange, trade for it against BTC as if it was dollars,  and it will work just fine. 
Thats the secret to why tether wont die; it doesnt really need to be backed because dollars arent backed either, and tether is actually less seizable than actual USD because bitfinex isnt as capricious as the legacy banks.

The problem is that you are ignoring the factors which should control blocksize: the ability to have highly decentralized nodes. The Eth model has reduced the number of archival fullnodes down to a singular one.  Bcash, if anyone ever bothers to use it, will follow the same path. In order for bitcoin to remain the one true blockchain, it must follow the infrastructure that exists and not try to outpace it.
Just like you cannot widen a road until all land is one singular million lane highway; there is a natural maximum with diminishing returns for blocksize. with our current ~4mb block size limit, we are close to optimal and it should only change when the conditions are appropriate.
The current pressure levels are barely enough to full up the current 4mb capacity, much less call for an increase.

This is completely false; the value that bitcoin has absolutely flowed out of value held in fiat or gold. It doesnt ever need to be a closed system, and wont be until the dollar dies. 
Even if someone has the same number of dollars or ounces of gold, they are worth somewhat less than before, because that buying power leaked into bitcoin. 
At a certain rate, the dollar might die off due to hyperbitcoinization. But they can coexist for a while with real value flowing between them.

The overall capacity could be much higher with less waste if we built what the market demanded rather than building out a hugely inefficient network of roads. 
Eating trash from a rubbish bin is better than starving; but who said starving is the alternative? Why not just eat normal food rather than dumpster dive ?


It says that dumbly widening lanes can make problems worse, and that smarter solutions are needed.  Flattening all of atlanta into one contiguous ribbon of highway is not a smart way to solve its traffic problems. Neither is the bcash approach to blocksize.


Wallet makers can make it easy. The real reason people dont bother is that fees are so low they dont care much. When fees got high enough for people to care, wallets were under pressure to make improvements. Even now many wallets are getting segwit compatible, for that reason among others.
The people who are screaming and whining for a block size increase are spammers who's business model is not viable unless they can get space on the blockchain for cheap.
There are also some bad players like bitmain/bitpay, who want to see bitcoin die so they can keep printing new coins to line their pockets at the public expense.


The market should decide what is and is not spam, not individuals. 
Arbitrarily raising the blocksize until your favorite use of the blockchain becomes viable is not in the best interest of the network. If it stays profitable without an undo size increase, then its not spam.

I agree with that. But I personally know several people who think BCH is like a divided up bitcoin so they can buy fewer units. 
People are used to stock markets and commonly think they must buy whole units of a BTC because that is how it works for stocks. 
They see "bitcoin cash" and think  "Ah, this is a divided up bitcoin so i can buy less" and then they take on huge losses from scamcoin.
Its deceptive labeling, and IMO everyone who lost money on bcash should be eligible for some level of recompensation for that.

I suspect the mean is skewed here. That site can only measure people who self-select to use it. Median is likely more telling; since some places have advanced to fairly blazing speed while most have seen smaller gains. 
If you see median speeds rise, that is a strong argument for a revision; if its backed up by usage data. The death of veriblock and closing in on 100% segwit usage would be a good start.


I think there is still plenty of room for softfork changes, such as signature aggregation. There may also be a technique to increase the portion of a transaction which is outside the old "base layer" with some softfork technique. Hard forks are very undesirable, and I wouldnt resort to one unless we were really straining the limits and nothing smarter could be done.
Even then; its entirely possible to never hard fork again. If we accept that very very old nodes might not be able to see the entire UTXO set somehow, and may only track some legacy portion of the network, then all future expansion could be softfork based.


Killing of the free fee market would just lead to waste and shitcoinery, imo. I see it as a huge negative. Plenty of alts have gone down that road. 


Rising median computing power/network bandwidth combined with very high adoption of the technologies which allow for more space (segwit)  further combined with an exhaustion of softfork avenues for space expansion.

I've done fine: what i want is a world where all people can do as well as merit allows, and a world in which merit-less, and non-productive human beings are not feted and rewarded just for being privileged. Your typical major corporation CEO, for example. 


Look 100 years ago, big picture. Its essentially 1:1 with dollars, and has equaled their fall, with a few large dips and spikes. if you look short term, you are trying to time the market; and that is a game only insiders can win. Day traders die poor. If you held 20$ of silver 100 years ago, you would have $20 of silver today. And it can only get worse by leaps and bounds for obvious reasons (technology)


Gold is mostly traded electronically but gold is physical: ergo most gold traded is counterfeit. Bitcoin does not share that flaw.  
Dont forget when FDR essentially stole all the gold. 
Most importantly: Tech is always poised to make gold exponentially easier to find, mine, and recycle, and to reduce the amounts needed for industry.  Unless we regress to pre-industrial society, gold is a very poor money.
Imagine a cheaply launched asteroid survey satellite which could pinpoint mountains of cheap gold and nudge them closer to earth. 


Indeed, you can stop that sentence right there.


Its largely the same reason they are not money. Various flaws from high transaction cost, variable quality, cost to validate, tendency to decay, etc. There really is not much for an punter to do with commodities if he is not involved in the production or consumption of them. Looking for an investment class commodity is the same as looking for a ideal commodity, which is the same as looking for a money. Following the trail, this leads past gold to bitcoin.


And suffer the same downsides as any proxy managed investment or public stock corporation. Fundamentally they come down to a simple concept: other people will work against their own personal interest and instead for your personal interest. Its a forlorn hope.


Please explain: I'm not aware of another side really. 
My vision of bitcoin is simple: it enables pure free market capitalism: "From each by ability and desire, to each by merit and results". 
It enables all people to be on the same level ground for investment opportunities and accumulation and transmission of capital. 
It encourages people to seek out the work that is most valued by others, and to avoid work which is not valued. It punishes the wasteful and the unfair in perfect proportion, while rewarding the careful and the fair as well.
It removes perverse incentives towards centralization, and allows disincentives of scale to work normally. It does not suffer the exploitative classes long luxury, and it makes a large stockpile of money something you can only spend once.
What other side is there?

Its impossible to tell how many senders are in a transaction. Even if there is only one p2[X]pkh input, that does not necessarily mean there was a single "sender" per se; there are plenty of ways to collaboratively form a signature from multiple sources, and have the final result look like a single input.
Also, its extremely rare to have a single recipient; in those case its almost always an internal sweep or some kind of rare manual thing. Average transactions have at least two recipients most of the time; the destination party and the change receiving party, which is usually one of the senders.

No its not; bitcoin could absolutely be eclipsed. ETH is an utter joke so that wont be it is all; many of us could accept some "other chain" taking over, but people always proposed such unlikely gimp chains such as bcash, monero, eth etc, which have such glaring flaws that it ruins the rest of your comment. 
Furthermore; in this case your point is still wrong in one way: inflation and market demand do work differently. If bitcoin loses popularity vs some other monetary commodity, then the ratio of current holdings stays the same. When fiat inflates, its like the founders issuing themselves more premined goodness, and the ratios of holding skew towards those who control the supply. 


No, its the normal state of a growing economy. Inflation happens naturally in disasters, to encourage rapid investment and quick recovery. Deflation happens naturally in growth, to reduce reckless investment and encourage savings. 
Deflationary spirals only happen when money creation and destruction are tied to debts. Such systems, like the dollar, cause crashes in disasters by encouraging savings, and cause run away reckless investment during growth, creating a boom-bust cycle.
Now a question for you: why do government prefer the latter over the former despite the obvious flaws?

 Sales tax just doesnt scale past 10%; attempts to do so cause massive black market activity. (this happens with cigarettes for example)


Its the bottom of the slippery slope. it starts reasonable sounding; like massive amounts of grey market sales for things like used cars, appliances, etc. People start doing barter networks, or classified ads trades, then start forming a full blown underground economy. 
The government panics, starts shutting things down/cracking down. Soon they have a "report your neighbor program" when you can call a red flag hotline to report untaxed transactions; next thing you know they are hauling in gramdma's baking cookies. 
My main point was; sales tax above ~10% starts to cause immense black market pressure. People can et very creative when it comes to a 10% savings on everything they buy; imagine 23%. 
You can already imagine a "gifting website" where you can give unconditional "gifts" of bitcoin, and get gifts of various consumer products in return, without any "sale" happening per se. Or even a sales website hosted overseas where "sales tax is the responsibility of the customer", but everything is strangely 20% cheaper than stores but all shipped domestically. There could be lawyers who set up small businesses for people so they can do all of their shopping B2B without paying taxes.
The main reason taxes work now is that they are largely automatic and beyond your control. Payroll taxes are stolen before you ever get your hands on the money. Sales taxes go as high as they can without creating too much black market activity pressure (usually between 4% and 10%) Large taxes are attached to easily stolen goods, such as cars and houses, which are hard to trade quietly.
Tons of trades happen without paying taxes today; small jobs for cash in hand under the table. Neighborhood level bartering and lending. Vending machine sales. Classified ad sales and trades. Most non-major-site internet purchases dodge local sales tax. Tons of economic activity avoid taxes where it is easy to do so and the risks are low. The art of taxation is the art of removing friction from the process, reducing the allure of non-compliance, removing privacy from financial activity, and making an example of people form time to time just to remind people.
A pure bitcoin economy would devastate taxation from day one, just because of the sheer privacy from it. The first step in a tax collection action is seizure; imagine how much harder that gets when the majority of a persons suspected fortune could be beyond reach ?

Silver: crap investment which loses money at the rate of the dollar
gold: poor investment that is highly manipulated and often confiscated
CD: return less than inflation takes
commodities: not an investment
ETFs: the best ones are composed of stock indicies
Real Estate: it is good or bad largely dependent on your ability to instantiate debt. If you can get 100 million dollar loans at reasonable interest, and the bank sharing or taking on most of the risk, you can generate a wealthy lifestyle pretty much at will. You are the in crowd, the power elite. If you cannot, then you will get smaller loans at higher interest, while holding all the risk your self. you are not the power elite.
There are essentially no real investment opportunities for non elites right now. You can get lucky with timing the real estate market, or you can hold stocks and take it, hoping other people buying high and selling low will subsidize the graft inherent in the system well enough to leave you with some gains. If you are not an insider, insider trading, then you are a sheep to be shorn at will. You will never make as much as true insiders, but you may do better relative to the average person.

Fuedal government rand on land taxes; they are simply not efficient enough to support a modern government. Read adam smiths book "The wealth of nations" for a primer on this topic. 
In the old days; you could counts goods and animals coming out of a plot of land to capture a reasonable guess as to how much tax could be extracted.  But if most modern work is virtual; and most of the money or products changing hands exist as network messages rather than physical goods, it becomes intractable.
Imagine a person who does white collar work; such as accounting. He doesnt declare his occupation or taxes to the government; and gets paid in bitcoin, which is also not provably his. "Where" does his work happen, per se? Where does he get paid, per se. how does his contribution to the economy show up in land taxes? 
If the government sets and arbitrary magic number for the amount of bitcoin they want for his rent; how do they even know the real amount involved and what is appropriate ?
They might be able to lower the amount until its cheaper to pay it than avoid it; but the government left behind will be tiny and trivial. They cannot audit each person, nor sieze each piece of property.


So would I, but I'm fairly confident that government wont allow such diminution without fighting back. The modern tax state is more about control than actual extraction of wealth. They dont actually need the taxes to extract wealth; they can literally create money.
There would never be another war, it just wouldnt be economically possible.

It can work if you get the timing right. 
The biggest risk is deflation; there will be a fit of deflation. Maybe in the next months, maybe in the next years. 
When it happens, the dollar will surge momentarily while all commodities, stocks, real estate, gold, and yes bitcoin all tumble rapidly. Its involuntary reaction to dollars being deleted by debt settlement, and people across all commodities panic selling to pay their own debts. 
Soon it leads to job/income losses which causes deflation to accelerate. 
The good new is: deflation is temporary. The Fed and US Govt cannot tolerate deflation for very long, and will step in to cause inflation. This immediately skyrockets gold, and might have the same impact on bitcoin. (or bitcion may steal gold's thunder, who knows)
So how do you ride through 6-10 months of hard deflation? Easy: have an emergency fund.  
An emergency fund is a pile of fiat which can covers your fiat debt expenses for many months. You never risk it or gamble it, because of this exact type of situation. 
If your friend has a suitable emergency fund, then he will probably do okay on his bitcoin stash. His shitcoins will get rekt tho, they always do.

While there is some interesting technology; none of it is groundbreaking nor cutting edge. All the concepts included in bitcoin were already at least a decade old when bitcoin was put together. 
What is brilliant about satoshi's work is the synthesis of fields: p2p, crypto, austrian economics, game theory, and incentive bootstrapping. He designed a system that could work at a tiny scale and low value, and decades morph into a world spanning system of epic scale with essentially no design changes, no security flaws, and a near perfect incentive system.


Then bitcoin rubs you the wrong way itself; bitcoin is first and foremost a technology designed to defeat monetary socialism.
Bitcoin is an attempt to undermine all that is wrong with modern banking and the modern dollar, to end the credit-debt cycle, to stop recessions and depressions, and restore normalcy, fairness, and economic stability. 
Its low tech and fairly simple technologically ; whats new in bitcoin is primarily a socioeconomic system designed to foment peaceful and voluntary monetary revolution.

A payment has a net transfer of funds from one party to another. 
A pure join or tumble has no net transfer of funds, aside from a small amount of fees. (everyone is getting back what they put in)
So making it clear that it is a payment and not a join gives away real information. Structuring it so that it could be a join, a payment, or even a combination join and payment is better, imo.
The upside of the simple payment mask is that it might confuse a simple or naive forensics algorithm.  It wont confuse a fancy one though, so I personally don't see it as a good tradeoff.
An example of how to make it a join+ payment
* Inputs from Alice: 2M 2M 3.75M
* Inputs from Bob: 2.5M
* Inputs from Charlie: 3M
* Outputs to Alice: 500K
* Outputs to Bob: 2M 2M 2M 3M 500K 250K
* Outputs to Charlie: 3M
Alice is making a payment, Bob is receiving a payment, and Charlie is just tumbling. 
What this looks like from the outside:


If it was a pure tumble, the only sure link would be the 3.75 -&gt; .25, the rest have multiple paths. the possibility that there is a payment involved makes it even harder to analyze, because now the owner of the 3.75 might not be the owner of the .25, which in this case we see alice paid it to bob, so classic sudoku has failed.
The original was:


Its clear that there must be a payment here. If you can color the coins before participation, then you only have two paths to follow. 
So, for the sake of example, if you knew the 2.5 came from "bob" then you have to guess whether bob paid 1.95 to alice, or alice paid 7.2 to bob. If the price rounds to an even fiat amount, you can bias the direction; it might be that 7.2 is a likely payment amount while 1.95 is unlikely. Its then more likely that alice paid bob, and the best guess is thus accurate.

After some digging, the gist of it is this:
* Alice is going to pay Bob X satoshi
* Bob has some funds lying around
* Bob propose that Alice pays him X + Y satoshi instead, but Bob provides the extra Y satoshi
* Alice forms a transaction which spends her X sats, plus Bobs Y sats, with an output amount of X + Y arriving at Bob's destination address
In short; its a real coinjoin between two parties, combined with a payment. The communication to coordinate it is like a kind of collaborative payments protocol. 
A downside compared to normal coinjoin is that there will not be a high sudoku complexity, due to the lack of lots of equal amounts. 
In their example transaction, you can see




It seems clear that it is a unilateral payment because the txfee is all shoulderd by one party, and there is no chance this can be a join. IMO this could be significantly improved by changing it to


The four output coins could be then going to the same person in a payment way, or this could also be interpreted like a coinjoin with a very high complexity number. (small amount tweaks needed to hide the source of the txfee)
Arguably, one upside of the transaction as shown is that is will quickly confuse the more primitive kinds of block forensics which will assume this is a simple wallet payment with change. But after just a few of these, the wallet membership count swells high enough for them to know its not a real wallet spend, and then its just a less than optimal coin join to look at, and thus the overt coinjoin is harder to analyze.

this is somewhat inaccurate. A transaction can have many inputs and many output, any of which can be legacy, wrapped segwit, or native segwit.
even just putting the outputs into a segwit destination is significant enough to call it a segwit tx. It may be a smaller size savings, like 3 bytes, but its still something. Why would you discount that? 
Today, sadly, native segwit for all inputs and outputs is still rare, but it will be the biggest savings once common.

The number of places that buy/sell/trade in LTC is relatively insignificant.


ETH is my poster child for "buzzword bingo". Most of the things eth people crow about are on my "downsides" list of things you do not want in a crypto currency. Premined? Turing complete? ASIC resistant? Unclear and variable issuance? PoS?


Unplanned hardforks of the main chain. Massive flaws in contract scripts causing loss of funds. Lack of any semblance of a long term scaling plan. The design documents are a joke. Its all too easy to measure, imo.


I am certainly open to other tech. In fact, before segwit I was very skeptical of bitcoins long term potential due to the malleability issue. There may still be a better design out there, im certainly keeping an eye out for it.

Naked shorts, if allowed, dont really affect the price of btc; its just like a side bet with both sides of the gamble settled in fiat. the contract buyer pays up front, and the contract seller has enough fiat in reserve to pay a full margin call should the short turn against them. Either way, zero impact on btc or btc prices whatsoever. It may help reduce volatility; as those involved in or dependent upon btc prices may be able to buy reduced volatility. For example; a mining operation that wants to maintain consistent income could buy put options and sell calls. 
Now, real actual shorting and longing can affect the btc price. Obviously going long on btc is simply buying and hodling it. Simpe demand there. Shorting is borrowing and selling it; for that to be possible the lender has to buy it first. 
So if banks allow for real shorting, then the effect of a short squeeze would be a massive pump.

If you arent consuming or producing bitcoin as a commodity, you probably have no real value to gain from options contracts. They are super easy to manipulate, and if you arent using them as a risk hedging system with the exchange it self as your counter parting then its just gambling, but the house just decides who wins and who loses because they hold all the cards.
"Technically your gamble was correct, however there was a brief sub second spike and we margin called you at a huge loss. Have a nice day"
"Excellent prediction, but the market dropped 100 points right as your options were expiring, then a few minutes later recovered back to where it was"
So if any gain or loss you would stand to make is not perfectly counterbalanced by your defined plan to sell or buy at expiration anyway, then you are basically making a free donation to the exchange operators. The exchange operators are the only ones in a reasonable position to write.

Nothing is 100% anything; we compare relative levels of socialist vs capitalism, and I chose the most socialist examples to be found. 


Of course; absolutes only exist on paper. 
I'm not arguing for *pure theoretical capitalism*, I'm arguing that we should make society as capitalist as we possibly can. 
In general; capitalism not only works well with free speech, it absolutely requires it. Central controls on speech will distort the market. The core of capitalism is the free market, which by definition is uncontrolled and decentralized.
Socialism allows for central planning; if you think central planning can work, then central speech regulation should work as well. If there is any chance that uncontrolled speech will disrupt central planning, then those with power will invariably eliminate that possibility.

Bitcoin does spend the majority of its time not too far away from the yearly low. So watching yearly lows does give a pretty good picture of what you can expect the value to be around. 
While yearly highs tend to only be available for very short times, and very few people find that is the right time to do some purchasing. 
That said, I think you might be making one mistake: Survivorship bias

This is not about depreciation. Shrinkage may be a closer analogy.
But even if computing equipment was immune to wear and tear like gold it would lose value,  in trade, and operating cost, and opportunity cost. 
The point here is that the nature of alternative models available for purchase is improving rapidly in quality while dropping in cost. That is inflation, and when one asset inflates the assets it is tradable for receive deflationary pressure in return.
If you know that the quality of computer you could buy with dollars will be more the later you buy, you are incentivized to buy it at the last possible time to meet your needs.
If you buy bitcoin instead of computing inventory for the same trade value you can expect bitcoin must deflate, while the equipment will be inflating rapidly (and thus you would want to sell it as soon as possible)

This is interesting. 
I've always thought that stored-energy would make a very interesting commodity system, and depending on how universal and durable it was, it could even be a form of currency. 
The most stable form of such currency today would be oil; since hydrocarbons at the most dense and easiest to handle form of energy. 
The properties of oil or any energy storage doesnt really make a good form of money however, since production is highly variable,  its not very durable, and its hard to assay. Also: it can be consumed. Not ideal. The fact that energy has a practical commodity value is also a malfeature to its role as a currency. Intrinsic value is actually a negative for a currency. 
 
Another important aspect is that human needs are not limited to just energy, but things which cannot easily be handled via energy alone (entertainment, real estate, etc) 
So while energy is interesting, bitcoin is much more suitable as a currency. It has in common with energy a universality of nature and a lack of centralized control. But is is vastly easier to transport and assay, and is far far more durable.

There is a difference between natural inflation, which is what happens when an economy shrinks and during disasters, and artificial inflation, which is what happens when the rich take taxes out of the working poor.


The idea is to extract as much blood from the host as possible without killing it. 
The true inflation rate is likely somewhere between 6%-10%, but it is hard to measure the loss due to productivity gains. In a hard currency regime with productivity gains, all prices should be dropping at some nearly constant rate. Perhaps 1% perhaps 6%, its hard to tell; but it is "The which is unseen" as bastiat would put it. There is no easy way to measure this lost opportunity cost.

A cost that is never going to be unspent. Its in the past; the hydroplants are not going to be unbuilt, the water cannot build up forever without flowing downstream. 
Bitcoin is allowing a sunk cost in renewable energy infrastructure, already paid for by society, to be used efficiently rather than go to waste. This means that the real net impact on electricity consumption by bitcoin is negligible. If you account for the savings of waste transmission, it might even be positive. 
It would make more sense for people to be protesting about the energy use of hydropower plants than bitcoin. IOW, it would make no sense at all.

The best time to obtain bitcoin is always "now".
That said: I'm not convinced we can hit a true bottom until we see a dollar-based stock market crash and/or a dollar-based real estate price crash.  Both of those are cyclical, and both are guaranteed to crash eventually. And when they do, they cause intense dollar deflation, and that drags down the price of everything, including gold and it will certainly hit bitcoin too. 
At the very bleakest bottom, just before QE/dollar-printing starts, that will be the lowest possible bottom we can achieve for BTC in terms of dollars. The truth is, we havent had such a crash since bitcoin first started, and until we see it, this is all uncharted territory.

I dont follow; Would it not just be the lesser of the two curves? It would also become elastic, since a high demand for it could boost rate which could attract more liquidity to clear the market.


Imagine that the coordinator has a set of liq providers who have registered an amount of liquidity they are willing to provide, and a price for which they will participate. (they could adjust their fee rates and amounts over time)
When filling out a round, the coordinator could reach out to those liquidity providers and include them in any unfilled rounds, starting from the least expensive. Of course, it would only be able to include them if other participants in the round have agreed to contribute towards the cost of liquidity sufficient to cover the expense.
An concrete example of a two participant round: 
* a liquidity provider (X) agreed to provide inputs to a join on demand, in exchange for fee coverage (txfee + coordinator fee) plus 20 basis points, then 
* a normal tumbling user (Y) indicates that they are willing to pay up to 50 basis points extra to expedite their transaction (above the standard txfee and collaboration fee costs)
* lets say Y's tumbling amount is 10 million sat, and this means Y is pledging up to an additional 50K sat towards liquidity, but would prefer to pay as little as possible.
* Including client X in the CJ transaction has a cost for the inputs and outputs to be included. It also has a cost for the coordination fee. Lets say for the sake of argument those sum to 10K sat
* Assume client X is the cheapest offer for liquidity, verified by client and coordinator
* Client X expects 20K sat as its fee, 20bps * 10million, and the total cost to include the liquidity is 30K, and since there is 50K available, X is invited to join the round
* Client Y pays a total of 30K sat extra to induce X to participate, on top of the 10K normal fees, for a total cost of 40K sat out of 10M
Of course, if a cheaper liquidity source is found before the round completes, X could be uninvited from the round on that basis. If there is not enough satoshi available to purchase liquidity, or not enough liquidity on offer, then the round has to wait as usual. 
But as soon as enough liquidity is available the transaction is completed. 
It provides an economic incentive for liquidity to be provided, and allows the cost to float with the market rate. 
The cost of liquidity could be evenly split across all pledging participants, up to the limit they indicated when joining the round. If they find they are waiting too long, they could increase their proposed amount in order to attract more liquidty and/or expedite the completion of the round.


Why not?
I dont see why it is not strictly superior. 
Even if the average is zero fee, there could be times when the network is slow or lacking for participants, and those that do participate want to do more tumbling that is possible. The risk and overhead cost of operating a liquidity provider hot wallet could be low enough and the fees high enough to attract additional liquidity. 
The liq providers could also benefit from tumbling as their primary earning. For example, a tumbling client with a very low time preference who is not in a hurry, may offer liquidity participation at no additional cost other than subsidization of their txfee + coordinator fee. (or even less) In this case, they are not participating for profit, but for the benefits of tumbilng - they simply want cheaper and slower tumbling.


I dont follow; do you mean solo tumbling ? I dont think that adds any forensic defense unless truly uncorrelated coins are mixed.

Do you have employees?
If so, they will need to be able to receive bitcoin for payments, and do it without your help. So in that case you will need something integrated with your cash register. 
In general, I suggest using something that is well integrated with your normal cash register, so you dont have to fumble around with anything special during a checkout process. 
If you do something special then it will eventually start to feel like a hassle.

Can you say why you dont like the obvious idea:
    allow users to register their interest in participating in joins if they get a small return. 
so the pool of fund available to join would be like a market: the more you are willing to pay, the more funds become available. 
For example: 
* only willing to pay txfee = no join
* willing to pay txfee + coordinator fee = join with other casual joiners
* willing to pay txfee + coordinator fee + some level of liquidity fee = join with liquidity providers and casuals

Any funds you hold in bitcoin form exist simultaneously in the US and PH too. It costs you 0% to transfer BTC between those countries because its already there. 
If you only receive payment in fiat, you may have some costs to buy BTC. And if you only make payments in fiat, you may have some costs to sell BTC. 
The first option is to cut costs by staying in BTC form longer. See if you have methods to earn BTC directly (a shopkeeper or contractor may have this option easily, but an employee might not). Also, see if you can pay bills directly in BTC. Every time you avoid a fiat currency exchange, that is a benefit. 
The second option is to make your BTC trades at a profit. If you are not in a rush to buy or sell, you can often do so at a premium or a discount. All btc buying and selling involves a maker and a taker; a person in a rush paying a fee, and a person not in a rush earning a fee.
A third option is to move your savings into BTC. You can move all or some of your long term cash savings into BTC form. The upside is that will allow you to keep a much large quantity of your cash savings equally in both countries. The downside is that BTC price is known to shift vs fiat currencies, and sometimes quite quickly. In the long term the shifts are always positive so far; so this should only be done with long term savings.
If you do not have long term cash savings, or you routinely need to move small amounts of money from fiat to fiat, you are going to have to pay fees. There is no way around it, since you have a high time preference, you will always have to pay someone more patient for the privilege of moving your fiat. You cannot control fiat, or declare which country it is in since you do not own a bank; you can only submit to the rules that the banks impose on you. Getting out of that problem can only be achieved by opting out of bank money. 
Bitcoin can help keep the fiat fees low, but it cannot eliminate them.

Bitcoin could easily absorb 1 billion USD. Talking with large providers, like cicle, coinbase, or any of the miner-sourcing specialists, it would be quite easy to arrange for a handful of OTC trades which sum to 1Billion USD. 
A larger question is how a newb like buffet could actual hold his btc. A 4 of 9 way shared multisig wallet with 7 airgapped hardware wallets assigned to 6 different bonded treasurers, one to himself, 2 recovery keys in bank vaults, would be one example of a good enough system for about 1 billion usd. you could even throw in a disaster insurance contract.

Are you saying that bitmain bought into a "silver" and were tricked into thinking it could be a gold? I dont feel that quite captures what happened. 
Silver's price history is proof that commodity value and length of service is useless for making a money. 
However bcash was something else; bcash was an attempt to replace bitcoin with a new token controlled by bitmain, and one that would not threaten their hardware advantages. 
They believed that with a near-monopoly on mining pools, a near-monopoly on mining hardware, and a near-total collusion between all major exchanges, celebs, and websites that they had enough of a coalition to replace the economic and technological core of bitcoin with one that was under their control .
It was a billion dollar gamble. It turned out that their "almost" monopoly was a good as a boat with "almost" no holes in the hull: it very quickly sank in deep water. 
It was not a naive attempt to buy a "silver" or anything belevolent; it was a failed coup, a hostile takeover attempt that came up short, and all or nothing gamble in a casino by a whale who thought they could break the bank. 
Their illusions have been cleared up: Miners are service providers. They dont have a stronger voice than anyone else in the community. Developers have power only so long as they have trust. And trust in not something you can buy or sell, but only earn slowly and lose quickly. All the celebs and early businesses who sold their trust instead lost it.

I'm sure anyone would spend it for material things, once that point is reached and they are ready to dip into savings. But you dont blow all your savings in a day, you keep savings for long periods and spend it slowly.
Hodlers arent going to switch over their saving account from BTC to USD just because the numbers got bigger. Traders might, especially the kind who think in terms of USD. For some reason they are most comfortable when they are dollar bagholders. But hodlers save in BTC for the long haul. They are most comfortable when their savings are 100% btc based.
Another way to tool at it is "Wont capitulate at any low price". No matter how high they bought in, the real Holder types arent going to sell just to recoup some small percent - they are in it for the political change they want to see.
So "Won't sell at any price" makes perfect sense to me. Hodlers arent going to dump btc savings for dirty fiats savings at any point.

I see those as the same; in Wasabi you get change and pay some fees. If you have enough inputs, you could get slightly less change and get slightly more fees, within the bounds of the join structuring. 
That said; it would be nice if a predictable output amount could be expected. That way a "spend" operation could be identical from a "tumble" operation. 


The anonymity model in zerolink is clearly better. In JM not everyone can map all the links. It depends on their order of participation. the Taker always can,  someone who controls the IRC server arguably could. It does reduce the value of joining for the makers, unlike wasabi's model.


Im confused by this terminology here; if other people participate in a round, then  you are mixing with other people. 
Do you mean that the funds must always return to yourself, and cannot be part of a spend to an outside address you control ? (jm doesnt handle that well either)  If so, then we are just using different terminology.
I think it would be a huge benefit if a spend was indistinguishable from a tumble. Do you think it is not possible for zerolink to allow spends ?
Transaction jargon:
* Join/Mix = any transaction with multiple separate participants with separate aims.
* Spend = a transaction including a transfer of funds from one person to another, usually to buy something or pay a debt
* Tumble = a transaction where the funds are returned to the same owner, only done for the purposes of increasing anonymity
If wasabi zerolink join tx's included an indistinguishable amount of tumbles and spends, then it would be much harder to perform forensics
Its the difference between:
* Tumble, Tumble , Tumble, Spend, Tumble , Tumble
* Join, Join, Join, Join, Join, Join
Many of the forensic weaknesses of JoinMarket come at entry and exit points from the tumbling modes, and the wallet exodus. 
Also, Unlike samourai, where a "spend" is pretending to be a "Tumble" using stonewall, its much better to perform a real tumble with other uncorrelated coins.

If even one person can rationally account for bitcoins future supply, then it is not pure inflation. 
* Gold: there was little understanding of supply and demand, and very little information on total gold supplies or expected increases
* Dollar supplies are mostly driven by money creation and destruction by banks. They arent predictable so much as observable.
* The tulip thing was a derivatives market; not really comparable
* The cycles could also be simply uncorrelated to halvenings
Unlike past situations, the total supply of BTC is very well known. What is less well known is the daily active supply.  The knowledge that bitcoin has an ultimate supply cap is the very basis for it having any value at all, and a large surface market is fairly good at evening out daily supply to match demand for predictable events.
Unexpected supply events, such as the surprise and unannounced MtGox sales had an immediate impact on the market price. Expected and anticipated changes, like halvenings, dont really seem to have any provable correlation to bull cycles at all.

Massive is your word; it is inflation none the less. It has to be or else the credit bubble would pop. QE has allowed the economy to limp along without hyperinflation. It has been variously higher and lower in the past.
And yes oil is down; largely due to technological deflation. We waste less fuel with improved efficiency in burning, and various extraction techniques have increased the supply. This is precisely the effect I described above and you failed to refute.

This is not about depreciation. Shrinkage may be a closer analogy.
But even if computing equipment was immune to wear and tear like gold it would lose value,  in trade, and operating cost, and opportunity cost. 
The point here is that the nature of alternative models available for purchase is improving rapidly in quality while dropping in cost. That is inflation, and when one asset inflates the assets it is tradable for receive deflationary pressure in return.
If you know that the quality of computer you could buy with dollars will be more the later you buy, you are incentivized to buy it at the last possible time to meet your needs.
If you buy bitcoin instead of computing inventory for the same trade value you can expect bitcoin must deflate, while the equipment will be inflating rapidly (and thus you would want to sell it as soon as possible)

The internet has "competition" theory, but in practice it has 100% won out, and all other network protocols verge on irrelevant. TCP/IP is the one world network. In the early days we had frame relay, serial phone protocols, banyan vines, ipx/spx, etc various alts. They are all now effectively dead or hyper niche.
Bitcoin is the "internet of money" in that same sense; at least for now, there is no crypto-money protocol which is close to displacing it. There is more value to society in agreeing upon one common carrier of value information, and negative value in having a smorgasbord of incompatible ones.

I can see banks existing, its just that i think they will actually expect settlement for any large purchases, and the collective fiction of current fractional reserve would largely be eliminate. Im not sure what the final percentage of "safe" float will be, but I expect it will be quite small indeed compared to our current system; bailouts would be impossible.
Also loans would likely work the same way. Todays loans are nearly zero risk, because the money loaned is imaginary. With bitcoin, actual loans would have to come from existing reserves, which means they will be much more carefully given out.
It would be nice to see banking return to being a plus to the economy instead of a drag.

Its not different, you are just deluded. The definition you are using is also just fine: you just have to peel back your delusions a bit. 
Read "the wealth of nations" to get some of the basic level info.  Profit is any increase in wealth we can create; its what leads to the good things in life that we all want. Profit is all the means of life, and it is natural that we seek it. It is knowledge, comfort, freedom, food, possessions, and more. 


You still think that the universe is zero sum, which is childish. When you build something new that does not mean you stole it from another dimension: when you profit you do not take form others you make wealth where there was none before.

Almost the perfect example; you can go back through history and find that funding wars is the primary motive for playing games with money. Since the days of rome when emperors would debase their coins to pay for soldiers, british kings played with tally sticks to finance wars, the american continental congrress printed millions of paper dollars back by nothing to finance the revolution, abe Lincoln invented the greenback to finance the civil war, and the modern form of banking financed ww1 and ww2.
The problem with war is that it is dangerous, yields no profits only losses, so nobody does it for fun; you have to trick people into it and playing with money is the easiest way. IOW, the dollar is warbucks.


Sure, its popular, I suspect that is largely because it doesnt have asics yet, so people can still "mine" at home. 
But many consider its fundamentals too weak to be a real contender, enough to make them sick of eth trolls.

No, since in that case the total capacity of the channel is 0.5, a 1btc transaction could never move over that channel all at once. However, (ignoring fees) A could send multiple smaller transactions to C.
For example: A could send 0.5 to C, who then sends it back to the LN in order with withdraw to his cold storage. Then A could send another 0.5.
Lets say H is a cold storage helper: When you send him funds over LN, he sends an non-LN transaction to your cold storage
* A [10, 0 ] =&gt; LN
* C [0, 0.5] =&gt; LN
* H [0, 10] =&gt; LN
* C Cold Storage [0]
A sends 0.5 to C:
* A [9.5, 0.5 ] =&gt; LN
* C [0.5, 0] =&gt; LN
* H [0, 10] =&gt; LN
* C Cold Storage [0]
C Sends 0.5 to his cold storage:
* A [9.5, 0.5 ] =&gt; LN
* C [0, 0.5] =&gt; LN
* H [0.5, 9.5] =&gt; LN
* C Cold Storage [0.5]
A sends the other 0.5 to C:
* A [9.0, 1 ] =&gt; LN
* C [0.5, 0] =&gt; LN
* H [0.5, 9.5] =&gt; LN
* C Cold Storage [0.5]
Now C has received 1.0 from A in total, with 0.5 in his lightning channel, and 0.5 moved off to cold storage with the help of "H". Moving funds to cold storage also helped to reset his lightning channel so it could be used to receive more funds from A.

Most gadgets and products lose value. You wouldnt try to save a laptop for 10 years then expect it to gain value (it probably wont even function)

Bitcoin is unique in that it is not inflationary; it deflates. And bitcoin trade vs the dollar would push inflationary pressure on the dollar.

Yes; the goal of a bitwise radix trie for an index would be to keep it in contiguous ram; and garbage collect immediately upon pruning. (or course, keeping the parent pointers or stack needed for that could be memory-expensive, which i didnt account for) 
The actual utxo set would need to be on disk; and that itself we would want to have normal garbage collection /defrag for.
The utxo set for most users is primarily insert/delete actions, which should be the most optimized cases even over normal searching. That in itself is unusual for most databases.


True, but it might be a fun background activity for downtime. The sheer time cost of rebuilding the UTXO from the beginning is the biggest barrier to doing it casually. Perhaps we are getting close to the era of a formal utxo checkpoint format.

New math may be developed, or flaws may be found in the hash algorithm during 1000 years, because that is a long time.  Its also possible that the math is simple enough that there are no shortcuts. (i.e in 1000 years Pythagoras' equation will still be correct.) In that case you can wait 1000 years or a million years and it wont make a difference.
Because according to the laws of physics we know, bruteforcing large keys via a computer; even the most perfect quantum computer which operates on the smallest planck energies with perfect use and no waste, would still take all the matter and energy in the universe and trillions of billions of years on top.

I dont think so; but if there is positive value in closing the channel for the other party then eventually they would want their funds back. 
It could also be possible to have a separate but secure network service that remembers the last chain state for you, perhaps encrypted so that only you can read it. That would be a reasonable safety net for a large channel which is at risk of catastrophic failure, such as being hit by a grenade.

Its a very solvable problem imo, but the trezor people dont seem to think memorize-ability is important to them. 
considering how easily it has been proven to extract keys from trezors, i think you should never keep them loaded for long and should wipe them after every use - which means easily memorized 12 word phrases are mandatory. For now you just have to use something other than a trezor to generate them, and be aware of the risks of restoring with trezors method.

Bitcion maximalism is common sense; there is no need nor purpose for insecure low tech alts pumped &amp; dumped with tons of meaningless buzzwords.

I'm not saying that bitcoin will always be the one true blockchain, but I am saying that only one crypto currency can survive in the market, and there is little need for a a second one. If you get as far away as mars, there is clear utility for a second chain, just not near earth.  
As far as I can tell, bitcoin is leading in hash strength, adoption, rate of development, and quality of engineering. I cant see any other crypto being even close; so that makes me a maximalist; aka a realist. You can talk to me about alts when any of those facts change.

This is a good point, i didnt even consider the bail out option for the upside.

The security of the network is proportional to the block reward which is ideally driven by the TX fee) 
If the value is arbitrarily low, so is the fee and thus the security, and the meaning of using it for escrow thus diminished. What good is escrow if it is cheap/easy to hack or defraud it?
Steady deflation and wide usage is ideal case for bitcoin. The foundational requirement on top of which "applications" such as escrow can function is based fully upon a long lived bubble of speculative durable asset savings, iow hard "money".
If you are only looking to blockchains as application platforms, such as records such as namecoin, payments such as ripple, laundering such as monero, or nearly anything Etherum is planned for, then I am skeptical. Because blockchains are not really ideal for such applications; its a very inefficient algorithm honestly, and without an in kind monetary base they lack security.
OTOH, networks built on top of a strong currency base, such as LN, may have a future, since having a way to do microtransactions on a hard currency has clear value; it is strictly derivative of the money function.

Its sometimes less obvious than it may seem. The rate of human progress should be causing prices to go down; This is common sense: it used to take X people to run a factory to make cars or mine ores etc, now it takes far fewer. 
The increased productivity should be manifest all around us but they are suspiciously stable (for some product, such as gasoline) 
There is inflation, its canceling out human progress for the most part, and also slowly creeping up overt pricing as well.

(1) in an inflationary economy you are forced to chase risky investments in low efficiency corporations. Its like poker playing in vegas; you have to hope there are enough poor players to provide you a surplus while also paying off all the house cronies. 
(2) Most index funds are new; once too large of a share of the market is indexed then they become very vulnerable investements. This is like when a wikipedia page cites a news article which references a wikipedia page; it becomes the blind leading the blind.
(3) most long term market analysis that support holding stocks long term simply fail to account for the enrons. Survivorship bias makes the whole thing look a lot better than it is.

Fair point; I suspect this attack would be far easier to construct on bcash; because you could make just barely not dust sized transactions with zero fees to populate it. Ignoring dev time, perhaps $100 would be enough to mount the attack on bcash...


The bitcoin specific problem seems like it should be more solvable; the total amount of data is well within the range that consumer disks can manage. Indexing in leveldb seems fairly slow for this dataset however, and its seems to suffer more past a few 10's of mbs. 
Ideally, the utxo database needs an index of 32byte hash values + 4 byte index (coutpoint) to a small object containing information like the scriptpubkey and amount. 
This seems like an exceedingly easy requirement to optimize for; the index object is extremely predictable in length, and at least the hash part of it has a very uniform distribution. 
~51 million TX outs, with a 36byte search key, could be indexed with a radix-tree into about ~317mb of index.(assuming a 32 byte node or page offset in the index, reserving the value of 0 and negatives) The search time would be quite close to O(1) especially if it was all in-ram.
Its fun to think through, i feel like there is room to improve over leveldb..

I highly recommend not using that feature.
I meant that the device should utterly blank or holding trivial values in a completely difference mnemonic, and absolutely should not be holding your real mnemonic with a passphrase to mutate it.
The problem with user-chosen passphrases is that they are weak, and are invariably guessable and subject to brute force methods. Do yourself a favor and no not protect bitcoin with words or phrases you chose yourself; always let a random generator pick them (dice or cards can work, and are probably best)
Unless your passphrase is a whole new 12+ word mnemonic, then it is a false security blanket. 
In general, I highly recommend *not* using that feature; instead always keep your wallet blank, and recover with your mnemonic phrase as needed instead. Never choose your own password or passphrase, and always assume that and pin or passphrase chosen by yourself will be easily hacked (because it will).
Always generate a mnemonic with random methods.

If coinbase's customers continued buying as normal, and coinbase sent bitoonks to their addresses instead of bitcoin, the customers would not be able to see any bitcoin showing up in their wallets.  Customer's would quickly become outraged and there could be countless lawsuits.
Also consider bitpay: if bitpay posts a bitcoin address but only checks for bitoonks, then they will never see any customer payments, because the customer will send bitcoin. This means merchants and customers both will be unhappy. If bitpay tries to helpfully perform a replay attack on all payments received, then they are still robbing people of their bitcoin.

There is inflation, its canceling out human progress for the most part, and also slowly creeping up overt pricing as well.

Its similar to "market closing" in regular fiat/stock exchanges. you wait until the panic and downwards momentum subsides a bit, restage a false rally, spoof the orderbook, etc. A dedicated small fry who will sell at any price can always get out; the trick is making it seem like they have no reason to.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:47:30


Correct; people would always choose to spend less to get more if they can. 
The trick is this part:


This works with metal specie because it is hard to validate, and thus struck coins are worth more than bullion. The convenience of being able to accept a coin at face value exceeds the cost of validating each coin (assuming they are in reasonable condition) They also have a very short range; hand to hand and face to face. IMO, it is not the law which makes people accept debasement, but the convenience and utility.
Validating silver coins is hard, whereas validating bitcoins is trivial. Unlike with metals, there is no seigniorage; you dont need to restructure bitcoins. There is no counterfeiting, no debasing, and no substituting possible: something either is bitcoin or is not.
And bitcoins are long distance tradable- which always reaches outside of the local authority; and always provides a baseline external valuation.
So there is no simple way to force people to accept a half-diluted bitcoin, because it would be very easy to tell the difference for the person receiving the coin, and it would not be spendable online in the same way, and would not serve the same purpose for import/export/trade.
I think these properties make bitcoin very hard to fractionally reserve, and also very hard to wrap in unbacked IOU's. 
The same properties may effective exempt it from greshams law; in fact you could argue that is the fundamental design of bitcoin from day one, and if it is subject to greshams law it would be a failed project by definition.
The fact that a bitcoin has any value over $1 to me is defacto evidence that it is not subject to greshams. I do not think blind speculation alone could have driven it this far; there must be some utility happening - some value prospect that eclipses the dollar.
An aside: the unbacked pure fiat dollar is its own counterfeit.

@_date: 2019-09-19 15:36:28
you can answer that: why arent you buying ?
The bitcoin market is full of millions of people and they all have separate minds. 
The most important ones are the regular hodlers. They buy in small regular amounts. They might buy a little more on dips, and a little less on bubbles. 
The most important sellers are miners; they fund their operations either by selling btc to themselves or others. Either way it has the same effect; a fairly stead sell pressure. 
The balance between miners and holders sets the real price. 
Panicky consumers come and go; all they do is make exchanges rich and put money in the pockets of alt coin scammers. Overall, they are more detrimental than anything. Derivative buyers and sellers either stabilize the price or get broke, so they also dont matter much.
So if you imagine how hodlers will react to various bits of finaincial news, you have your answer. They dont care; they continue to earn their normal income, and they continue to buy at their normal steady rate. If the number of hodlers grow, the price will slowly find a new high average. 
The next halvening will double hodler pressure on the market, and that will deliver us to the next ATH-floor

You have been trained wrong; even if you made a new address that would not have helped. Deterministic wallets are a lot weaker than you realize in this regard. 
When you share a private key from a deterministic wallet, all the other private keys can be computed. To be safe you have to make an entirely new wallet with an entirely new mnemonic (or a new hardened root at least) or else the same thing would happen.
In general, I dont advise newbies to ever share private keys. When ever you consider sharing private keys, you have to weigh it against the risk of losing everything in the same wallet.

In short; its 2^160 work for ripemd-160 collision attacks against satoshi's horde.
With p2sh, the incentive is instead to come up with the attack apriori, by maliciously finding a much easier to compute (2^80 work only) birthday collision before any funds are deposited. 
In short: this only works if you can pre-plan the attack such that the victim is tricked into depositing funds into a trapped multisig address. It does not work for existing addresses, and for single addresses it would be pointless because the only possible victim would be oneself.
This neatly explains it, thank you very much mr gibbs.

The only part that is in doubt is the "dust attack". 
Spam attacks are a double edged sword: spend too little on fees and they have no effect. Spend too much and they incentivize miners to switch back to btc.  So perhaps they art not talking about spam attacks. 
Next they could try to bloat the utxo. While annoying, it is unlikely to knock too many nodes offline. Less well designed chains like ETH already use much larger working sets.
So unless they have come up with a new form of attack, i dont see much here. 
That said, this is still the most serious assault on bitcoin since it began. We really need more widespread control of mining; hopefully these new Japanese chips will help spread out control somewhat.

Its not about what QE causes; its about what QE prevents.
If you are wounded in battle, and your body is riddled with arrows, QE is a way to keep limping around without ever taking the arrows out and cleaning the wounds so they can heal. 


That is the whole theory behind why QE should be used. Unfortunately, it lacks a mechnism for undoing the damage caused by credit bubbles. 
If a credit bubble is a heroin high, then a recession is like withdrawal. QE is the notion that you can just keep taking more and more heroin in higher and higher doses to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Sure, you can tell yourself that your body will suddenly grow stronger and be able to metabolize all that opiate without needing to go into withdrawal. But most people would say you are just in denial to think so.
In concrete terms; credit bubbles of overly easy money leave the economy in a bad shape, because assets are misallocated. Doubling down on that credit extension means that while you can forestall a crash, you are still not fixing the misallocations; in fact most likely you are making even worse assets, throwing good money after bad.

Money creation as a system "works" only in the sense that it is a cheat, a way to rig the game. If its not unfair, then it only thing it will do is make the dollar rapidly lose all value.

You realize why it works for a small group of people but not a large group, right?
Imagine a simplfied society with ration tickets. A ration ticket written by the king is like a command that everyone must honor, giving the holder whatever is written on it, and it can only be used once. 
If the king and a few friends are the only one who make them, then society still works. Obviously there is a hierarchy, where the king and his best buddies get the best of everything, where everyone else slaves away for very little. The king can just walk around and write himself a ticket for literally anything he feels like, while everyone else must accept the amount issued to them by the king.
Now, imagine if everyone could write or get these ration tickets in equal amounts: they would lose all value and meaning. If someone presents you a "give me your lunch" ticket, then you could present one right back, and both sides would realize this instantly and stop honoring the tickets entirely.  Very quickly people would have to look for a new way to organize society, because the tickets wouldnt have any meaning. 
Money is a bit more complicated, but boils down to the same problem: Money creation used as a technique to steal wealth only works if it is unfair; limited to a small group of elites. If too many people get money created for them, then the money itself stops having value.

They have debts to pay. Is there some law in your mind that you can just completely stop servicing your debts when there is deflation?

The economy recovered despite this intervention, not because of it.


Correct; bitcoin is a manifestation of Austrian econ.

you realize all that that is arbitrary right? And the interest you are paid will never match inflation, so long as its a dollar account. The 6 transaction limit is ridiculous - just a way to justify more fees. 
If banking continues to be a thing; then it should be radically simplified imo. why not give the interest of savings with the flexibility of checking ? Why have all sorts of secret fees and corner cases ? Why take days to clear what could be cleared instantly. Why allow for trivial fraud and network attacks ? Why allow for abuse of the chargeback system ?  
As someone who works on the guts of banking, ill tell you why: people are used to the old way, dont know what they are missing, banks like making money, and the government grants them a nice shield from competition. 
Anyway, its too late for all that. The opportunity for modernization was the 80s-90s. Technology has taken a quantum leap. Legacy banking will be moot - maybe even within our lifetimes. Consumer banking makes little sense in todays world. Its just not needed. Consumer loans such as mortgages can hopefully be abandoned as a practice once the dollar is displaced.

Thats actually a negative; SPV nodes trade away a lot security for a little performance. Bread's implementation is also particularly weak, in that it can be forked from the network due to incomplete consensus checking. 
Overall, bread has poor performance as a wallet. Electrum's solution is more elegant overall: still has no single point of failure, but relies upon full nodes rather than a half-baked spv node. For higher security levels, wallets that can link to a trusted full node provide a truely safe way to transact large amounts.
SPV can be useful for other things, I dont think they are particular well suited to being wallets however.
SPV wallets are a bad compromise; no significant gain in wallet security but a large hit to performance, and a burden on the network.

If you read what I wrote you would have know I was describing the credit cycles caused by adherents to keynesian economic theories. I was not trying to promulgate their nonsense.


Milton Friedman had some wacko moments as well; mostly due to trying to be relevant to modern politics. He flirted with dead end ideas such as UBI, and later recanted. Upgrading to David Friedman's works gives a clearer picture, devoid of most of the misadventures of the chicago school. Chicago school is a PC austrian-lite; its failings are largely fixed by reverting to the genuine article.


Reading your own past posts reveals which of us is aggressively overconfident. If you truly understood the chicago school and Austrian econ i would not have had to spell it out for you. You are brazen with your ignorance, stating the price is value and other basic confusions or the most primitive of topics.
Even your quote is radically out of context and you fail to see how i have been trying to explain it to you. In keynesian economies (fractional reserve national fiat currency with a central bank) velocity movements reinforce M movements precisely causing the boom/bust cycle. In a sound money economy velocity reacts to P and Q because M cannot move. In a keynesian economy velocity can in fact be a reinforcing factor, while in a sound money economy its strictly a dependent variable controlled by other forces.
You are failing to realize how the movements on the market equilibrium depend on the building blocks of said market economy; unprecendented foolery like the great depression could not be caused without this structural manipulation of the market network itself - as represented by the keynesian control system of monetary policy + fiscal policy + fractional reserve national fiat. 
Read Friedman's thermostat analogy which lays some of this out.
Please be aware of some of his basic teachings so you dont get confused again: price is not value. Fractional reserve money does not behaive as does ideal money. Suggestions to a keynesian control system to cause less harm do not imply endorsement of a kyenesian control system, any more than than bastiat or adam smith endorsed the theft of sovereigns.

The death of localbitcoins in the USA was a major loss in this war. 
LBC was moving major volume into and out of BTC form, and probably accounts for a lot of the early growth of BTC as a market. It was destined to die however, once it got attention.
Once the beast tuned in it became quite dangerous as feds and local police started randomly arresting using the system, while the big banks leaned on LBC the company to add KYC and essentially kill off their core product: Face to Face bitcoin for cash. 
Even if a form of LBC still existed which didnt compromise on facilitating f2f meetings, you still have the problem of various police departments using the service to rob from people participating. 
The problem comes down to the weaknesses of the dollar: moving USD electronically is very hard because nearly every way it can be moved is reversible, not anonymous, and requires tons of permission. Moving USD physically carries a lot of risk because it can only be done face to face, and simply having cash puts you are risk of being victimized by police.
Hopefully, a safe and casual way to move larger amounts of USD/BTC will come up again, so that people will have more easy ways to dump the dollar, and we dont end up getting ruined by the big exchanges.
Of course, the best option is to stick to an all BTC economy, and simple avoid dollars entirely. So far, this segment of the bitcoin economy is still very tiny.

I'm not sure what you mean here; if you are saying that a credit expansion drives price increases, then yes, I agree that is true.

Amounts and numbers dont mean the same thing with fiat as they do with sound money like bitcoin. Fiat money can never really be permanent by its nature, its always being created and destroyed. Even the new money created by QE can be destroyed by debt settlement, tax payments, or other means.
Its better to think of the supply fiat as a balloon inflated with the hot air of money creation forces, and shrinking due to deflationary forces. The heavy weight of debt carried by the balloon pulls it downwards, while QE generates lots of new supply which expands the bubble and keeps it afloat. The natural payment of debts, government austerity measures, and any cooling the in the rate of new spending and investment deflate the bubble. Real economic activity is supposed to be the engine that fills the bubble up, but that is not happening, so the false flame of QE is being used to substitute for it. 
When you have an engine failure, the goal of fixing the engine itself is not met by using a substitute such as QE, but QE does buy time to hope the engine gets better on its own.

This crash by comparison is only down to 1/3rd the peak, and the new low seems to be over triple the starting point.. so the "crash" is far milder, but the bubble longer to build up in the first place.
who knows is this is the real bottom or not, but it has a long way to go to match the old roller coaster ride.

That argument would be better for computers and tech gadgets which are far more purely in the realm of feature and spec bloat than cars are, but they actually do show price deflation so your assertion is clearly wrong.

I wasnt planning to teach keynesian 101.
In short: FRB works by creating a credit bubble of new money and new debt. The causes overavailability of money, and if mismanaged - malinvestment. With deflation, debtors default rapidly, causing creditors to stop giving out loans and the pool of money shrinks rapidly. The bubble pops, so to speak. A liquidity crises is caused by realization of malinvestment means basic trade paralysis - food rotting in the field while workers starve unemployed. The massive misallocation of societies resources is compounded by a failure of the monetary system.


Gold wasnt even legal to own for most of it. And there was never enough gold to match the dollar supply. not since lincoln first made the greenback. So there was no real backing - a 100% reserve system means there can be no money creation, and thus no depressions. 


Gold is too impractical - thats why it was replaced by paper money.


Except that you cannot sustainably run a fractional reserve on bitcoin. ASk mount Gox how that worked out. Thats the whole point of bitcoin. As soon as you fail to honor a withdraw you have a full run and collape and there is no power on earth which can bail you out.

It does; You can create other chains and even have them function for a short time. But bitcoin is many things together; a peer to peer network protocol, an economic incentive structure, a bootstrapping scaling and growth model, a development model, a economic community, and several other aspects. 
I'm not saying it could not be done again if bitcoin fails; someone could restart a similar phenomenon. 
But the fact is that blockchain on its own does not solve many problem. Its primarily useful as part of bitcoin, and thus depends on it to deliver its value.

Because hoarded money is not wealth. It cannot do anything to help the economy; it helped when it was hoarded. Stealing it to spend is the same as printing new money.


You just said it would free up dollars that had been locked up. That is increasing the supply. 
If I could create a trillion trillion dollars, put it in a box, and hide it, is the money supply affected or not affected?


They dont *create* wealth, they are not a source of it. They *have* some wealth, but it is continually replenished only by a sustained theft from the workers. Do you understand that?


The point is not whether it is good or bad; the point is that you think it will eliminate jobs and work. That is the luddism - that is the folly. Like all technological advancements, ML and automation are no more significant to society than the invention of shovels or tea kettles.


All tax systems are regressive, as are all government spending programs. That is an inevitable and unchangeable part of their nature. All theft benefits the thief, but at a great cost to society. Theft cannot be turned into productivity, as it is a force of pure destruction. It makes as much sense to imagine tax and UBI as a force for good, as it does bombing, pillaging, and genocide.


Please forgive my lack of eloquence. I will try to be polite.


If you were the only person on the planet, would you rather have endless food, entertainment, plentiful drink and shelter, or instead of all those things, would you rather be on a blasted wasteland with a billion dollars in paper money? One is wealth, one is money.
How much wealth do you think a lazy elite person who spends all their time at leisure and play can create? The may seem rich, but they do not create wealth. Where do you think their wealth comes from? If you call all involuntary or inequitable transfers of wealth "taxes", then does it not come from taxes levied upon those who do create wealth by working?
What do you think happens if you try to reverse the flow of taxes? How sustainable will it be.
Imagine a mediaval kingdom. The king lives in a castle, and the peasants live on farms. The peasants grow grains and vegetables and raise animals. They send to the king taxes, and the king consumes the product of the peasants. Now imagine you reverse that flow. What does the king make? How long will his wealth last if it is depleting ? He makes no grain, no vegetables, and no animals. So any wealth he sends to the peasants must have originally come from them. 
If the king promises to take more from all the peasants, but to give back equally, who will benefit and who will suffer more?
If he sells the idea that "everyone can be king, and noone needs to work" does that make sense to you?

Not all debt is created equal. When you have consumer debt or high interest debt, you are a loser. When you have productive low interest debt, you are a winner. Inflation is good for the latter; its literally how they confiscate wealth. The former group is where the wealth comes from.
Bitcoin is about putting everyone back on a level playing field. It removes the special privileges from those who can steal wealth by creating money, and also removes the consumer treadmill of bad debt.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:04:51


While there is some reward to early speculators, its really more of a reward for subsidizing the network and bootstrapping it.  There is no wealth transfer; the people buying and hodling today are taking a great risk for the benefit of others. Its a form of public service. 


Nonsense; that person will have access to real savings and finally be able to keep the value of their work.
The total sum of wealth available to society as a whole will increase; What bitcoin will do is release us from a stranglehold of old technology and outdated practices which have been wasting our economic potential. The extra liquidity, and removal of waste spending will allow a larger fraction of the workforce to focus on creating valuable goods and services (i.e. real wealth) 
What you are missing is the simple fact that there is no "transfer of wealth" involved at all. There is simply a releasing of our potential.

* 1 ). Yes really - you lose value fast with dollar. Ask your accountant if you don't know about this. they will advise you not to keep dollars around beyond an emergency fund. 
* 2). Not with dollars its not an investment, its a guaranteed loss. With sound money, like bitcoin, its an investment. And its the among best savings investments possible for the last few years. There is no guarantee it will proceed to keep reaching records highs - it has only happened 10 times in a row so far over a decade.
You are not forced to participate. You can sit on the sidelines with your loser coupons and enjoy guaranteed locked in losses like an idiot.

If the gain on bitcoin can be expressed in terms of dollars, then the loss on dollars can be expressed in terms of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the asset I choose to compare to and consider native, so the losses or gains I would have for dollars in terms of btc how I compute my gain/loss. 
For bitcoin, there is never a gain or loss, because 1 satoshi is always 1 satoshi.
For dollars held, the gain or loss depends on how many btc they are worth now vs when i purchased them.

Thats the problem - its not captialist enough. there is no real competition and too much regulation.


It costs them nothing; the drinks in the analogy, large and small are all imaginary. There is no cup and no soda. A bank would absolutely be motivated to offer better because there is no reason not to with such lack of cost. without competition though, there is also no reason to. its simply rent extraction.


They cant. Thats why crypto currency was invented.


You could still have escrow systems for security - that doesnt make it a bank. There could still be some types of loans, just not consumer debt.
Consumer debt is really just a plague; and it cannot survive without fractional reserve banking. If you are still laughing; you dont understand what service modern banks really offer. 


Maybe... but thats super pessimistic. A century ago there wasnt much air travel - the world was a very different place in countless ways. I think things can change faster than you may think. Finance has seems to be artificially static compared to everything else; but it cannot resist progress for long. 


For small amounts, its almost too easy: a hardware wallet. For smaller amounts, perhaps a custodial service. For large amounts, there no shortage of businesses competing to offer various types of escrow. 
Thats the thing; what banks offer is not really security. If bitcoin succeeds; they wont exist for long.

If that someone else is any kind of bank, then they would have conjured said money from thin air.


Categorically wrong. Fungibility is when all units as indistinguishable. Clearly, if a given unit of USD has some kind of history, then its possible to distinguish it.  If you could not tell anything about some unit of USD other than its amount, it would be fungible. Clearly that is not the case.
They may be using non-fungibility for the purpose of determining creditworthyness. Generally, when you exploit non-fungibility you have some aim in mine. Its not orthogonal at all, its the exact thing perfectly. 
I also demonstrated to you how this particular type of non-fungibility does not affect bitcoin. Get up to speed.

Most types of loans will cease to exist. And certainly far far fewer could possibly exist. Consumer debt would be all be eliminated, out of sheer mathematical necessity.
The new form of banking that takes over will be much like the origins of banking than the modern form. No new bitcoin can be created by a loan. Loans will be largely unavailable to consumers and individuals. Only short term low risk loans of a commercial nature will make sense.
Thus its fairly safe to say that by and large loans will cease to exist as we know them.

I guarantee you this is the case.
If you want to deal with fiat, you have to have a bank account. Cash is too unusuable in an macroscopic amount. To keep a bank account, you cannot have any crypto dealings unless your bank signs off. The only way the bank

Incorrect; You should learn about the motivations of the cypherpunks and cryptographers who designed it and its predecessors. It absolutely has a design intent, and if it is successful it will accomplish that regardless of your feelings on the matter.
Tool are not alive, but they does not mean they arent designed to a purpose. A grenade explodes to kill, a car transports along roads. People arens going to use ocean liners as hats. If the airplane is successful, people will be able to travel around the world more frequently - even if that hurts your feelings.


Bitcoin is designed with human motivations in mind. It is capitalist/anarchist sound money, with an economic incentive system designed to provide cryptographic security.  It was designed to do that job, and if it succeeds in the market it will perform it inevitably.
A thriving bitcoin market is physically incompatible with monetary policy and capital controls, with consumer debt, and many other Keynesian anachronisms.

Being wealthy requires leveraging debt. Living off of hard assets is stupid; its like paying cash when everyone else uses a credit card. Your cash payment gets the same price as their card payment, but they get rewards and kickbacks. So you are actually choosing to subsidize the card users. 
Debt works the same way. Any stocks, bonds, dollars, dollar denominated assets, and dollar linked assets you own all subsidize the people who know how to use leverage.
So its possible to live dollar debt free, its just dumb. Wealth in the fractional reserve economy is low interest debt.

there was a time when bank records were kept on paper, written checks moved most bank funds, and there was some kind of meaningful difference; and now that is largely historical. All the protocols are identical and checking vs savings is largely a "flag" of no value.
Im not talking about interest rates or fees; those change bank to bank, day to day.
Mechanically, bank accounts are identical.  Whatever differences separated them back 100 years ago have faded into irrelevance due to technological change.
That is my point: its perfectly understandable why people who are used to venmo, paypal, bitcoin and other modern things would find the distinction between savings and checking to be obscure, uninteresting, and irrelevant. Its an anachronism.

Its mostly a side effect of negative interest rates in banks. 
The prices for highly rated corporate debt have become so high that you lose money on the deal, but some people still buy them. 
They would never buy them if they could get a bank CD with even 0% interest for the same term, so its something that would normally never happen if interest rates were zero or positive.
If you know you need to hold cash for a certain time period, but the bank keeps charging you more and more every day, you are forced to look for alternative places to park the cash. (electronic cash not paper) Paper cash has an interest rate of zero, but its expensive to hold it in a safe with armed guards etc. So people try to lock in the highest interest rate they can for long periods. And when the best deal they can get is a negative yielded corporate bond, thats what you see today.

If you could borrow X * 100K dollars but only to buy gold, then you would expect the price of gold to be pushed up. If you could buy broccoli on 30 years of credit, then the price of broccoli would be pushed up. If you could buy a 4-8 year education on credit, then the price of education would go up. 
It should be obvious that ending the practice of money creation in a given market sector will reduce prices. We could argue by how much, but they would certainly come down. 
That said, having to save the full purchase price would also reduce demand. People would return to more economical options if they had no alternative.

Understanding the basics of how money system and taxes work makes UBI laughable from base principles. To rephrase UBI in simple terms, "We will take money from the people who work then give money to everyone"
By definition, its either a trifling amount, or else its enough to devalue the money itself until it is trifling. UBI in any amount big or small directly opposes the fundamental purpose and utility of money.

Bitcoin is way down near the bottom end of fiat river. The Fed's goal is for newly printed dollars to be tied up in treasuries, bonds, mortgages, and stocks, and not really filter down into everyday prices too much. It unavoidably impacts rents, but they dont want other commodities to be hit. 
For bitcoin to rise based on the dollar falling, some of those dollars have to filter down out of financial markets and actually start flowing through the wider economy.

Once again, these are highly related in terms of dollars, because a dollar earned and a dollar conjured from thin air appear to be indistinguishable. Bitcoin does not share this weakness, because a bitcoin cannot be instantiated on a whim, and also because noone sane would offer unsecured consumer debt in a solid currency.

I feel bitcoin has achieved the risk levels of a small cap stock. Thats not risk free - even large caps blue chips can lose 2/3rd of their value in a 9 month period. It just happened.

While it might be possible with some unexpected windfall of productivity growth; ultimately I am skeptical. The newfound wealth could extend the bubble longer, but the root cause of economic malaise will likely continue to go untreated.
There is a mass of malinvestment; poorly run companies which need to fail, a surplus of pensions without the backing investments, large amounts of government spending, and simple misallocation of fixed resources which I believe require an economic correction to remedy.
Without a correction; QE forever is likely to be what happens. The only question is how long it can last before reaching the singularity or destabilizing due to other forces.

Welcome to central banking.


This doesnt create a sustainable undead zombie economy, this just leads to outright collapse into dust. Its not a viable alternative. At least QE leaves a shell of a dead thing... UBI would leave nothing.
The reason noone takes UBI seriously is because it doesnt solve any problems, it just makes everything worse in every way. You would be directly destroying the currency and leaving chaos and people scrambling to find a way out.
Unless you are an "accelerationist" who wants to see the country burn to the ground, there is no viable reason to advocate UBI. A peaceful transition to bitcoin is far preferable than fire and fury.

The US is entering the poorly charted waters of QE forever. The Fed knows how the US economy reacted in the past to late stimulus, and is dead set on not allowing another recession. 
The question is: what happens next with this new fed policy. We can try to predict based on other countries who have sailed these seas before us:
Japan entered into the QE forever sea starting in the 90's [lost decade]( 
The result has been a fairly endless doldrums of stagnation. Slow economic growth paired with slow loss of purchasing power, with no end in sight. It has reached the point where the [BOJ owns ~80% of the Japanese economy]( with no exit plan. 
Its not clear how much longer this can be maintained in Japan, or what the effect of the US entering the same mode will be.

If you understood how money works you would realize that is a nonsense statement.
"keeping money out of the economy" is invariably a positive thing. It spreads wealth to those who have less money. 




Money is not wealth. It just doesnt work that way. The source of taxation is wealth, and wealth comes exclusively from those who work. There is no wealth to take or tax from the rich elites, all of it already comes from the people who work. They cannot benefit from being robbed more. 


So a technophobic Luddite cherry on top of your ignorance sundae.


* Automation is just another cotton gin. Dont be a luddite
* Taxes are always borne by the poor; dont pretend you can benefit them by redistributing their wealth away from them.

Okay; then let me flip it around on you: 
* Why does the US seem to be sinking into recession ?
* Why would the USA's QE program yield different results than Japans?
Shiller ratios, yield curves, debt ratios, stock prices, real estate prices all indicate recession strongly. From a historical review, there are unfailling signs that recession is due, despite the fact that the normal recovery from a recession never occurred. If QE worked, wouldnt we be able to sustain a recovery for at least a little while before faltering again?
Japan has walked down this road with similar if not identical results. QE led to a lackluster period of stagnation, followed by more and more rounds of QE. Now that the fed is talking about rate cuts and monetizing the 2 year treasury, does it not seem like we are following in precisely the same path?

Dollar prices changed, they didnt "go" anywhere. The dollar just got a bit more expensive.
Demand for dollars has gone up, and thus you get fewer dollars for your stocks when you sell and more stocks for your dollars when you buy. 
In the case of bitcoin, it looks some people gambled that bitcoin was going to go up a bunch real fast and they were wrong. So they were forced to sell their bitcoin for fewer dollars than they paid for them.  Since so many people were selling, you can see that the people buying the bitcoin from them could get away with paying them fewer dollars for each satoshi. Thats pretty smart; its always nice to pay less, even if what you are paying with is useless trash like dollars.

I think you have misunderstood the mechanics.
In normal sound deflation caused by increased production, people react by delaying spending - which ideal because it discourages malinvestment , rewards savers, etc. When people start spending, attracted by the low prices, then prices rapidly recover.
When fractional money deflation happens , its combined with decreasing production, so (M) is disappearing. The result is a nasty feedback loop where prices keep going down whether people spend or not; both M and V go down. Those who spend money attracted to low prices find that their spending does not cause any recovery - the money they spend doesnt recirculate instead it is destroyed when deposited at the bank. (it get used to settle some debt) So even the remaining production disappears because the only rational response is waiting until the monetary contraction ends and to start over from the shambles. 
Its very much a bubble collapse- and by not building such bubbles in the first place they cannot happen. 
Do you understand the basic machinery now ?

Basic econ. Here is a short explanation that is below 101 level: 


Savings is delayed spending. It is a type of investment - the best kind. Investing is not automatically good - much invested wealth goes to waste or even harm. Lending is the same. No investment is as economically good as savings. 
The only return on investment from private saving comes when the economy grows. So if the economy does not grow, there is no reward for saving.

"Down" is of course relative; there are still productivity increases cause by technology, and while absolute productivity might be going up, it could be drastically reduced from what it should have been. 
Productivity growth is not a way out of QE Forever however. Ultimately, the central bank will own more and more of the economy. Centralized ownership kills the engines of productivity, while a healthy correction while painful, clears out the malinvestments and debts without nationalizing all private assets.
In the short term; yes we may still see some good numbers, but so long as we must continue the money printing, things are headed to a bleak ending.
So unless technology outpaces all the taxes, overheads, and malinvestments to the extent that normal monetary policy can be restored, I dont think it matters.

Its foolish to to write derivatives into a market which can be easily moved to scoop  you as a way to gamble short or long.
Writing some calls out of the money as a way to sell held btc can work. Hell, if the price goes up temporarily when you do that you are happy because you got more than a market order alone could have. So instead of being short-squeezed, you are actually having someone pump the price at their own loss to give you a better deal. 
buying derivatives is still safe, since you cannot be exercised. For longs, its generally inferior to just buying btc.  Buying shorts is safe, but still just dumb gambling. 
The best way to bitcoin is buying BTC with lesser currency assets for long term savings, and directly spending BTC when you are ready for new goods or services.

It would be an excellent thing if people could horde money. Then poor people would have cheaper housing and more buying power. And it would be much easier for them to save for the future.


Completely wrong; printing money is inherently unfair, and is used to keep the poor people poor, and the old money at the top. The rich have access to new debt on better terms and vastly larger amounts.  When the rich people take out loans for new buildings or companies, the poor pay for it via inflation. Its a transfer of wealth from one person to another, such as featured in communism.

The purchasing power of money increases because the amount of good and services available increased while the pool of money remained the same.


The appreciation of bitcoin would be less extreme if it was the main money used in society and not a tiny niche startup currency.
Labor follows its own supply and demand curve. Businesses will employee those employees who generate the best margin; in general this means more expensive more productive employees crowd out cheaper but less productive ones. Employers have to keep paying higher rates for less quantity of labor, while employees have to keep improving their skills to be competitive. It takes a long time for the labor pool to expand, it does not track with productivity. So wages and productivity trend upwards, prices of goods and services down. Remember: services will use less total labor but at a higher rate per unit - "smarter work, not harder".
Wealth is not a zero sum game. Price levels are not wealth levels. For example: the GDP in nominal terms can flatline or go  downwards even as the economy of country grows and expands. Price != value.




It will certainly go down; we can only speculate by how much. I expect a noteworthy fraction, myself.


Yes they are. All the parts of house buying are impacted by money creation, not just the final price tag.
Bricks and steel would be cheaper- over time they would continue to go down in price as fabrication became more efficient. Labor cost might go up over time, as we discussed above - but the total amount of labor needed in the building of a new house will tend to go down, as people find more efficient ways to build them.

Food aid is ironically one of the greatest sources of starvation. 
The best "charity" and the most moral way to spend your money to buy things you like, and to earn your money fairly for good work. A person who buys a yacht or luxury car feeds countless workers and encourages life sustaining industry and good habits. 
Paying someone for a job well done is strictly better than simply giving them money; it doesnt create dependence and it gives them the pride of earning rather than the shame of subsidy.
Charity is morally inferior to simple spending.

a bank with zero assets, can loan 10 million from the federal reserve then fill up bank accounts up to 1 billion dollars (assuming it keeps a 10% reserve which it is exempt from at this size, so in fact could create much more). This bank has actual deposits of zero: zero dollars were take from someplace else where they already existed to deposit in this bank.  Thus, this bank has somehow created 1 billion dollars from thin air. That is how fractional reserve banking works.

You can visualize it this way: fewer people working for the same or higher salary, but producing the a larger amount of products than before. This leaves the profit levels the same for the business owners, but reduces prices of the good sold. This also frees up extra labor for other businesses or ventures to be created, and is the main process of the advancement of wealth production of a nation.

Here you are wrong; At any given point in time the cost/reward deman/supply are crystal clear. Just because you dont like the prices doesnt mean they are wrong.
it was clear through most of the bubble that mining work was being vastly overcompensated. So the market started firing back up old obsolete miners and deploying new ones as fast as it could adapt. This takes time. Once it came back down to normal, it is still well compensated, which explains the continuing growth in hashrate. 
You seem obsessed with short term swings, which easily average out compared to the time it takes to build out the infrastructure. This is partially because you are accustomed to the stabilizing effect of denomination: when nearly all prices and contracts are written in dollar terms, it causes a massive attenuation of short term price swings. Once the BTC market grows enough to start being used for denomination, you will see far less short period volatility.

Unless you think that 2/3 of stake is going to get online into hot wallets to vote, if not no PoS may ever happen. Or worse; if it does happen you may be trading tyranny of a small set for tyranny of an even smaller one. Furthermore, there are still ass-tons of flaws in the algorithm which may cause long range attacks of various types, which the miners can use. Worse still, even if the POS does fork, it dies without sufficient miners; nothing really prevents them from moving the security of the network away and double spending the hell out of the POS forks. Hostile mining can cause considerable grief on eth. All said, miners can still participate in PoS too, or attempt to stake grind or sybil it: you realize it might be cheap enough for them to DoS randdao in order to cause PoS to never converge.

False; that is crappy consumer debt at typically bad interest rates.

(The greater being the initial act of debt creation to buy such things)
Consumer debt; loans taken out for things which are not expected to generate revenue, is strictly bad and stupid. Unfortunately, the poor have little option, because they largely have no other way to buy a house or car realistically.

Some form of "money" is as old as civilization, but it has not always had money handlers in the loop. gold, silver, copper, salt, and many other commodities work peer to peer. 
There is a legitimate function for money lending specialists. A business being able to quickly react to a market need using leverage is a fairly safe business. And when done with real currency, involves real risk and does not involve a credit bubble.
Bankers who try to play games like fractional reserve with hard currency quickly go bankrupt without government protection.

If someone paid 1/1000's and tried to settle, they would likely end up paying 2000 times the amount they think they paid; they cannot settle less than a whole satoshi, and 1 satoshi is also the minimum miner fee. (the excess would go to miner fees or people receiving payments) 
If someone cares about losing this fractional satoshi, they would have to be very careful not to settle too early; and either spend or receive more before closing the channel.
They can:
* receive money over LN that brings them closer to whole values (close enough to settle)
* send more money to other people
* keep the channel open longer
As for the person who received 1 millisat from 1 billion people, hopefully for his sanity most of them came over a few common channels. When added all together, this means it should be easy for him to settle a channel for a large clean amount without any trouble.
for example, he could have received 333333.333 satoshi over channels A, B, C, and settle each for for  333300 satoshi, paying 33 satoshi miners fee for each settlement, and defacto giving 0.333 satoshi back to the other peer by letting it round down.

I see the disconnect; you dont understand the significance of lending in the dollar economy.
    


Printing money and loaning non-existent money into existence are effectively the same thing. 
It represents an instantaneous increase in the money supply.
Hard money "loans" are a separate topic; they are a completely different animal and not relevant to this discussion. 




Now, hopefully, you do. 
Loans are the mechanism of money creation in the modern world.


It is not possible; if you are counting fully backed hard "loans" then you are intentionally confounding the topic.


You cannot prevent all forms of lending and borrowing.
Even if you take it as a hypothetical, then money creation is still effectively a form of loan: its just instantly forgiven by the issuer. 
So this scenario is simply semantics, and you are still missing the point.
To summarize: inflation, money printing, and fractional reserve lending are all the same phenomenon in the dollar economy.

I told you two posts up that supply and demand do control the price, and that there is no inherent value. You seem to be missing the point, probably do to some mix of dislike and or obsession with the wrong information.
Do you realize or fail to realize that the "work" involved in PoW crypto currency mining has a very specific defintion, and is fungible. At the same time, at any given instant, the value of the same work is very precisely defined and a cost/earnings estimate is fairly trivial.
There is never any question about the present market demand or cost. Speculatively guessing the future cost/earning may be difficult, but due to the work algorithm in crypto, its probably one of the easiest futures markets to predict. (there is a floor margin at which some miner capacity will drop off)
Here is another bit to consider: if you are not a participant in the market, then your opinon on price levels is mostly irrelevant. If you think crypto is too volatile, or mining should have no value, then armed with econ 101 you should be able to immediately realize you are wrong.

But you make be making their situation worse with the donation otherwise. Food aid shuts down a countries agriculture, heightening dependence, empowering dictators, and ultimately starving more people than  before the food aid.
Those who are philanthropic often overlook the indignity of being given something for nothing; and it is bad for so many reasons while at the same time it causes dependence. Giving food is morally the same as the gift of a free shot of heroin from a drug dealer. (at least the drug dealer is self-aware)
There is a true test of when it is moral to donate: when you could reasonably expect the person to pay you back the full amount. At other times, its is jingoistic and patronizing at best, and horribly cruel at worst.
People need the dignity of supporting themselves, of standing on their own two feet and earning what they receive. When you take that away from them, it is harmful.


This is incorrect; not all spending is the same. Look at the broken window fallacy for an example of why.
Charity spending is not good for the economy in the way that food spending from earned income is. Food charity is a form of economic warfare. 
When you buy some product, any kind of valuable product that you see value in, you are driving the economy in a healthy sustainable fashion. When you give money to charity, you pervert and distort incentives, and ultimately harm the people you are trying to help.
To be clear: I am absolutely in favor of charity to help overcome exceptional temporary circumstances.

when someone empties out their entire cj balance, to put money back into their regular spending wallet.
The root problem is that the same person owns the change outputs as well as the tumbled outputs. 


Thats not the use case at hand; using a tumbler script to make a payment would be ideal if it was the norm. In particular, a coinjoin style wallet being used for normal payments would help solve the problem. However most online payment systems have a strict timeline, such as 15 minutes or else the payment could be lost. So its very rare for people to use tumbling scripts for payments.

Bitcoin is heavily deflationary, which makes lending impractical anyway, because the default risk would always be unacceptably high for both the lender and the debtor. 
Imagine buying a car for 1btc of debt. 1 year later, the car is only worth 0.7 btc, but your debt is 0.9 btc. Two years later, the car is worth 0.2 btc but your debt is 0.65 btc. The bank is out 1BTC, but the collateral on the loan has disappeared. The debtor is no longer able to afford the payments, and seeks to default. The bank repossesses the car, and takes a huge loss of over half their investment, while the debtor no longer has the car which he paid double the price for.  


Bitcoin Exchanges with large deposits can play games, but they take tremendous risk of insolvency. When bitfinex had massive withdrawals of tethers, it seems they were able to unwind, so they must not have been so foolish as to leave them unbacked. Evidence from the field indicates that being hacked is the primary source of unbacked exchange balances.  
And nearly noone will accept exchange tickets in place of bitcoin, so there is no payments float or redeposits. So even exchanges have very limited ability to fake deposits.
Dollar inflation is practically unlimited because the defacto policy of the fed is to lend/print any amount needed to cover loan reserves to member banks.  Compared to the USD, where $1 can become thousands, there is hardly any ability to safely inflate bitcoin, so it remains deflationary, and also becomes unusable for consumption debt.
For all intents and purposes; bitcoin cannot be fractionally reserved. If bitcoin wins the money wars, consumer debt is going to end. And I think that will make the world a much better place.

There are some suggestions to help make a successful bitcoin campaign: 
* Dont use bitpay, coinbase, or any other widely hated service. 
* Dont play games with altcoins - it looks bad and makes you untrustworthy.
* Support the latest version - that means segwit with bech32
* Support extensions like Lightning Network

It seems to be trying to compare apples and oranges, and with a not so hidden agenda.
LN is a payment network built on top of BTC.   
A more valid comparison might be: Making a payment on L1 vs L2 with lightning. And also, Receiving payment.
Staking seems to mean "on a hot wallet on line" rather than the usual meaning. I would fix the language. In general to send BTC or LN, both cases the funds are usually held in a hot wallet, and for receiving in both cases no funds are needed to be kept hot. so thats one example of a biased comparison with an agenda in this table.

* Can be spent world-wide with no limitations or barriers.
* Has a universal common value (changes fast but still is universal)
* Does not require you to give up personal private information
* Does not require you to trust the merchant with your banking info
* The store does not have to wait to get paid, or take a risk of not getting paid at all
* Settles *way* faster than any other payment method
* Less overhead than any other payment network
* Irreversible (you might see this as a downside or upside depending on the situation, but it is an upside in general)
Most consumers dont know what "settlement" is, dont care about their privacy, dont get paid their income in bitcoin, dont realize how much merchants pay for transaction processing, and like to be able to reverse transactions sometimes. 
This makes it hard for them to realize or understand all of the benefits of using bitcoin. 
But they are real benefits; so sooner or later you will find yourself using it or a system built on top of it.

I used to think so, but have largely found that that is fallacious. I find that type checking is often used as a crutch - as an excuse for insufficient unit testing. And that thorough unit tests make the overhead of typing a waste.
When writing low level code; you are close to the machine and bound to it and its essential types. At all other levels, types are more of a problem source than a solution.


The fact that they were willing to completely disable the strong crypto and RNG was the bug in that case. There is no perfect test for randomness, despite the types of tests specified in FIPS for such.

The price of houses is quite inflated by the free money printing. I imagine without that they would be 2 to 10 times cheaper depending on the market. 
Before real estate money printing became the norm, a house would cost ~ 2-4 years' salary depending on the market. And we have gotten a lot more efficient at building them and all the materials that go into a house since then. 


Is it a productive investment? If so, then yes, debt leverage can make sense, assuming your profit forecast exceeds interest and deflation by a good margin. 
If you plan to just live in the house then no, debt leverage is a social negative and a dangerous personal liability.

The Fed just raised rates to 2.5 % 
This means they are confident the economic situation is strong enough to power through the deflationary forces that the increased interest rate will cause, or they want to pressure the trump administration. probably both. 
Personally, I think they are playing with fire. Even if they have some productivity data that shows strength, deflation can easily become a run-away train that is hard to stop. If they lose control of the deflation rate, it will end up as the bitcoin singularity. 
Perhaps they have a trump card planned; if deflation starts to set in perhaps they will announce some emergency QE. Or maybe they will come back to trump offering a big spending plan which he will find impossible to refuse (like a 9-11 event)

Yes it does; One transactions outputs are the next transactions inputs. You can tell from the output scripts that the destination address is not segwit. A non-segwit destination means that the next tx will be non-segwit, or half-segwit at best.

I think he has the fundamental reason for centralization wrong; its not because its better or faster - its because the government tilts the playing field to give advantages to big centralized players. 
Decentralization is superior in the end; but due to market interference it takes longer to develop than it would otherwise. Small companies would more quickly chip away at big players, then decentralized tech would take over from the smaller companies.

If you are a bitcoin expert, and you fully understand all the crypto involved, how entropy works, and how bip-38 works, how network tx's and sweeping work, and are comfortable using manual level wallet controls from an airgapped machine with a good source of entropy... then you can maybe make paper wallets work. 
Otherwise, you are going to get burnt. Paper wallets are a very old tech dating back to the earliest days of BTC. They are fully obsolete, and shouldnt be used anymore.

impressive patience. 
A reminder - if you left that balance on an exchange then you dont actually own any bitcoin. Unless you withdraw it to your own control, you could lose them all. This has happened in the past when a major exchange went under. There is zero protection for BTC balances, because noone can print BTC to bail you out.
I highly recommend getting a hardware wallet, and withdrawing your BTC from the exchange. Until you do that, you own 0 BTC and an unbacked receipt for *maybe 10 BTC*.

Value doesn't change; price does. And remember, houses can be built - there is supply. The market is elastic. So I did not suggest that demand would need to go down. Demand can go up and prices still go down with deleveraging.
Value is value; demand is somewhat inflated by money printing; Price is deeply inflated with money printing. 


Another way to say that is 500,000 real estate dollars are worth maybe ~250,000 or fewer normal dollars. Its hard to say how much distortion there is until it unwinds fully.
The point is this has nothing to do with bitcoin; its a purely dollar side distortion. Bitcoin might help to end it, however. And that would be a wonderful thing.


It is not amazingly ironic that you are describing the present situation right now. What exactly do you think a mortgage is anyway? It's a lifetime of bondage to a bank that wasn't necessary in the past, a distortion that reduced home ownership and allowed a small financial elite to buy up nearly all property in the country by simply printing money.

even if they fractionally reserve 99% of their balance, and operated strictly out of their 1%, it still wouldnt be enough to create an inflationary bitcoin.
* withdraws for external purchases must all be real, so there are no redeposits
* deflation prevents lending, so there are no "debt bitcoins" 
* stolen btc which is spent is gone
I'm sure that exchanges have and do participate in stealing deposits. But that is still not enough to make viable fractional reserve. Remember, 1 dollar can turn into hundred or thousands. While even if all bitcoin was in exchanges, and ever exchange fakes 99.9 percent of their balance, you would still only have a x 2 multiplier. (and an insane risk of a bank run)
Unlike dollars, bitcoin can meaningfully exist outside of banks.
Imagine if you could call your bank, and tell them to erase $100K from your balance because you were transferring it to a napkin at your dinner table with a crayon. And imagine that napkin became real verifiable dollars that would be accepted at any bank in the world. *That* is why bitcoin cannot be fractionally reserved.

Think of hardware wallets as alternative calculators; they are a substitute computer to use instead of a windows or mac box. thats all. They are not vaults or safes; any physical security they provide is only vs amateurs. (and not determined amateurs either)
If you lose your hardware wallet you should sweep the funds as soon as possible; and consider your old mnemonic to be compromised.

Well of course you dont export the public derived keys. 
A nice extension to bip44 would be a bitcoin-cash extension. It could generate a fully private-derived key path with no children for each cash-note export. And it wouldnt risk key leak like public derived paths.
Import would still have to be sweep asap. But that unavoidable; you dont want to trust the person who gave you the cash any longer than necessary.

The goal of QE is to impact asset prices without impacting the broader market. 
If asset prices can stay high, then private debt can continue to increase, because collateral values stay high which keeps spending and money velocity moving.
So long as the fiat doesnt leak out, the system can skate along a little longer with low inflation and semi-stagnant growth, just like the last 10 years.
If money printing cannot be contained, the fed gets to choose between deflation (which causes unrest/revolution/anti-government sentiment) and stagflation/hyperinflation. With bitcoin in the field, the stagflation may simply be too risky, because monetary competitors like bitcoin can turn it into hyperinflation and ultimately hyperbitcoinization.
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:09:19
Hyperinflation, or even just a good bout of stagflation is bitcoin's holy grail "black swan" event. 
Since 2009 we have been waiting and hoping for a major first world economy to step on the old money printing pedal, and cause open market inflation across a broad commodity index.  
Once debt-caused deflation gains momentum, and if there is no more room for QE, then money printing becomes the only option in the central bank toolchest. 
That said, QE is an amazingly effective way at extending the lifetime of a bubble, and allowing the productivity curve to catch up with debt levels. 
If technology such as automation, ML, energy production and storage, etc all continue to improve and even accelerate, then the real economy increases fast enough to allow the debt to pile up without a crash. 
QE buys them this time, by artificially propping up asset prices and thus allowing new debt to continue to be formed. If the socialists dont get too greedy and take too much blood out of the economy, they might never have to pay the piper.
So it could be a while; perhaps a decade or perhaps longer, before a big enough misstep is made to necessitate mass money printing.
In the mean time all we can do is continue to improve the software ecosystem around bitcoin.

I have to say you took an incredible risk doing that. I cannot understand why anyone would deposit BTC onto an exchange other than a very small fiat purchase with the intention to spend immediately. 
The only practical use of an exchange is to deposit fiat in tiny amounts, trade to btc and withdraw as quickly as possible. BTC are only safe when in your own hands. 
Arbitrage sounds good on paper, but unless you are the owner of the exchange or close enough to trust them with your treasure, then its far too risky to deposit BTC on an exchange. 
Whether you are in the right or not, whether you are able to recover your funds or not, I hope others can learn from this lesson. A few percentage points of arbitrage is not worth losing 1200 btc for. 
Exchanges are temporary; they are ultimately pointless things that will cease to exist. As they become more and more unprofitable, they will always resort to stealing funds from their users. Those who are foolish enough to trust them will lose.

I would say it is positive for bitcoin, as it helps smooth out the price of btc across the world. Before Arb was common, the bitcoin price was wildly different across countries with weak fiat links.
So I do think Arb is a good thing, but putting thousands of btc at stake to earn a small profit each day of arb. And you have to leave funds hot on an exchange. 
This is like putting your life savings in the hands of someone with the ability to teleport beyond your reach at any second. 
So my comment is addressing the risk and obvious ability of exchanges to steal with little effort or consequences.  Ultimately, as BTC becomes more full-circuit, exchanges will be a thing of the past, and there is no chance they will go out of business gracefully. They will exit scam one at a time. 
I would recommend putting tiny amounts of money in the system at once, then arbing and immediately withdrawing. If the exchange has a good deposit/withdraw system, then you dont have to leave 100% of your funds in it at once, only a much smaller amount you put at risk. 
If an exchange does not have a bot-scriptable deposit and withdraw system, then dont use it.

Right; mortgages inflated the price of housing to where it now takes a lifetime to save up for one.  Before the mortgage, it was very possible to work and save up to buy a house.
The same has happened with student loans; it used to be possible to work through college, paying for your own rent, board, and tuition while attending classes with a student level job. Completely impossible today; thanks to the student loan.
It turns out that if you print massive quantities of money for something, the price goes up.

Unless you completely fail to get better at your job then you are more productive. 
Experience, familiarity, learning, and institutional knowledge all have a value, and for ar least 2-3 years productivity increases for new employees. 
Longer time-frames you might be right; an employee who doesnt continue to learn eventually stops raising their productivity.  There is also a price for opportunity cost and morale; keeping a popular long standing employee helps make other employees comfortable, and raising someone's salary a little bit higher can often reduce the chances of them being picked off by a competitor. 
Those are both special cases but with real bitcoin value. 
Salary going up is absolutely not inflation in most cases.

The network effect causes some level of centralization, but im convinced the government has a role. Without patents, copyrights, bank leverage, anti-competitive regulations, and other such tools, small businesses would easily chip away at the big companies margins. Hell, microsoft would be out of business the next day, and the major ISP's would probably start folding and selling parts of themselves to smaller companies within a week.
Google's patent minefield would lose meaning, and decent search competitors could come out. Apple monopoly on design and look would evaporate, and there would be countless apple lookalikes. 
Facebook and reddit would take longer - due to network effects. But not much longer.

Sure; but furthermore, they should not use any of the commonly available websites or tools for making bip38 wallets. They have far too many flaws and trust problems. if you really want to do it, have to code your own, because i dont know of any that i would endorse right now aside from some propriety ones that remain unpublished. The lack of segwit support in the spec itself is one major barrier too, so interoperability is limited.
Any bip38 passphrase used should be considered to have a very narrow value: it buys 5 minutes to sweep the private key away in case someone leaks the QR code image or bip38 string. Essentially its worthless.
Instead of bip38, its probably better to use a dedicated airgapped printer along with the airgapped machine, and print raw WIF format then cover it with a sticker. (ignoring the fact that there is also no segwit WIF standard). Some BTM's do something like this... while their implementation is somewhat fraught with risk people generally dont have too much trouble sweeping to the best of my knowledge.
Covering up the QR code with a sticker then makes it an appropriate bearer bond type of bitcoin-cash-paper, with less risk of compromise than a bip38 obfuscation.
As far as I know there is no good toolsuite for this available to the public. 
In short: the only thing to tell people about BIP38 bitcoin paper cash is that it is dead, for now.

just recently there was an exploit in safari that was a total remote root compromise. If you visited any familiar trusted web page, it could have a banner ad or other guest content which completely stole your btc down to the last sat.
I would say mac is not much safer than windows. The only viable desktop wallet clients with a reasonable chance of temporary safety are linuxes - like a ubuntu or fedora desktop. 
Even then I would limit the amount of BTC on a desktop computer connected to the internet to reasonable amount. A server linux is probably safe if well admined, but desktops have much broader attack surfaces.

This assumption is false. key stretching inevitably fails, as it is eventually overcome. The bip38 scrypt params are not increasing every year, they are staying the same. There are scrypt asics already. There is sufficient attack speed to render bip38 worthless. Brute force attacks generally work on human chosen passwords at some useful rate of success.
The reasons include:
* Humans are particularly poor at synthesizing entropy. You can actually detect human chosen digits statistically.
* Humans generally cannot memorize enough bits, without using mnemonic techniques
* The tricks people use to obfuscate passwords are well known to key crackers.
* With a profile of the target, you can radically increase success rate
* Wallets are subject to offline attacks; that means there is no way to rate limit guesses. Even systems with rate control are often bypassed (iphone for example)
* Humans can only memorize so many passwords, so we should get more use out of them than a single transaction
The only *guarantee* of security comes from entropy. Thats why modern wallets do not allow you to human-choose the base entropy. Thats why key recovery formats your base entropy into a very easy to memorize format. 
The lessons of modern crypto are very straight forward, and old school paper wallets are just not compliant. Apple tries very hard to let people safely use trivial passwords, and they get routinely cracked because its is a fools quest)
Its entirely possible for someone to use BIP38, and the old brainwallet standard safely. That method would be to synthesize 12 word bip39 mnemonic, memorize it, and use that as the password. But what a waste that is. Instead of a wallet they could use for years, they get one single measly transaction out of it. Of course the average person wont bother, they will choose 1999L0ve or something, and a certain percentage of them will lose funds. Inevitably. 
Self chosen passwords are unsafe for handling or securing bitcoin. 
Please think on it.
Remember; the scrypt time is symmetric. So your key stretching assumptions are facing off the weakest mobile phone browser crypto vs the nastiest ASIC farm. If a single guess takes 30 minues on the ASIC farm, how long does it take on the normal client ? For this reason, the defacto key stretching is essentially non-existent.

A sandboxed interpreter designed to run hostile code is a bad place for a wallet. 


You could say that about any interpreted or garbage collected language.

Having access to properly implemented crypto primitives in any language or development environment is still not ubiquitious.

Bitcoin is not an "investment", its best not to think of it that way. Its a currency, not an organization or business venture.


Real estate is very physical, its a meatspace thing. Bitcoin is the furthest thing from it.
So: how do you evaluate a currency? 
First, know what it is. Fiat cash is not really liquid enough to consider for "currency investment", and it always loses value so nothing to look at there. So realisitically, we are comparing bank money vs bitcoin.
We compare on:
* **Fundamental base properties** : portability, divisibility, limited supply, fungibility, durability, security, domain, ownability, controlability, tax
On this account bitcoin does very well in comparison to fiat bank monies. Its the only electronic money that can be used everywhere the internet touches. Fundamentals are the main reason to look at bitcoin.
* **Daily Use values**: unit of account for contracts, prices, wages; stability of value, volatility, acceptance, sticky prices
On these metrics Fiat still comes out on top vs bitcoin, and the dollar vs everything else. This doesnt help a "currency investor" since you arent acquiring the currency just to use it. And if anything, you want volatility so you have margin. So these are largely irrelevant. 
* **Trends**: public sentiment, new supply, destruction rate. 
Bitcoin responds to public sentiment, but that is notoriously hard to predict, and changes on a whim. The only clear pattern is the FOMO -&gt; Panic cycle which has happened so many times already. 
If you think bitcoin will continue to exist for at least 5 years, you can try to time a value based purchase strategy by timing the cycles.  If you think bitcoin will last for 100 years, you can try a growth based strategy, of slow DCA style investment with no intention of trying to find peak or valleys.
Personally, I would say the growth strategy is the best. It takes the least funds to invest, to mitigate losses by not having to venture too much. And the trend shows patience is the best way to get a good return. You can revert to spending once you "Find your moon"
If you dont think bitcoin will survive, there is nothing to do besides stay away.

While that is true in a simple sense; realistically not all dollars are created equal. The dollar is not fully fungible; for example car loan dollars can only be spent on new cars. Real estate loan dollars only on real estate. QE dollars on collaterlized securities. etc. Not to mentional international borders, etc. 
The dollar does now flow evenly; its more complicated. If QE is given time to fully unwind, then the fed gets to have its cake that it already ate.


While government debt is one factor, private debt is another. It still hasnt reached 2009 levels yet. An the Fed could always spew out more QE if debt becomes a problem.

Its easy to suggest a hardware wallet or a mobile wallet. bip44 style menmonic wallets, that suggest you write down your mnemonic as a backup before you memorize it, are ideal for most use cases. Its a good clean practice. 
What good is sending people to horribly coded, dangerous and hard to use websites with a long history of losing people money ? 
This isnt a risk tolerance thing, its a physical reality thing. There is no right and safe way to use a bip38 encrypted paper wallet that isnt fully redundant on a 12 word mnemonic anyway. Scrypt has asics now, remember. Remember this:  . Humans cannot choose bip38 passwords, not even smart cryptographers.  Use machine synthesized mnemonics, or roll them up with dice.
While belcher is distracting from his point by conflating web browser environment problems with language problems, the fundamental issues with bip38 paper wallets are real and we should no longer recommend them to anyone in any situation. Its a bad design, obsoleted and outdated.

Its a special type of money printing, which is designed not to leak out in to the open market. The new money circulates in small pool, such as stocks and mortgages. 
So it pumps up the prices of assets (businesses, stocks, real estate) without causing widespread inflation of all commodities. 
Its very smart; its the Tao of money printing. "To print money without printing money"
It cannot go on forever, or else the goverment ends up owning everything and the market collapses. But it has worked far better than I ever dreamed it would.

Lol, everyone is selling it. 
When you give up your personal information for any purpose, its naive to think the other party isnt going to try to benefit from it. 
When you shop with a credit card, the site, the end merchant, processors, bank, goverment, and various middlemen all retain a copy if they can.
When you buy a gun, if you think the ATF isnt keeping an illegal defacto gun registry, then you are naive. 
Anytime you are asked for personal details, you should expect them to be essentially public knowledge.

One of my main complaints with the btcpay ecosystem is their use of C# and microsoft binaries. 
What can you tell us about the codebase which will be used for your version ?
Good: C, C++, Javascript
Neutral: Python, Go
Not interested: Java, Ruby, C PHP, Haskell, etc

I think its fair. Its too hard for the average person to use safely, and is best discouraged completely. 
If there was an extension to BIP44 style wallets which could make private derived safely printable paper cash, which included an updated BIP38 (low security) handout level trivial passphrase, then yes it could be useful and safe enough to recommend. We could call it "bitcoin cash" or something.
IMO, the current ecosystem around bitcoin paper cash is just unsafe.

I just demonstrated why that is not the case. Read my post.


Thats how the whole world worked for centuries, you realize ? There may be some fallout from a dollar deleveraging, but overall the end result will be more healthy. 
The price of housing would right-size to the market, so in general housing prices would match real supply and demand instead of fools gold bubbles.
There is no need for a bubble &amp; crash cycle to run our whole economy. 


Manufacturing technology is why we don't need to be as self reliant as before. Even if the dollar goes away, the technology does not. Leverage has absolutely nothing to do with it.


Economic specialization of labor was written about in 1776. Its old as the hills, and it isn't going anywhere. It predates bubble money, and will outlive it as well.

Honestly i dont see much difference is the usability of any of the three major OS families on use for desktops. Linux is by far the easiest to install yourself, but generally people keep what came from the factory.  Polishes linuxes with support like chromebooks tend not to need much in the way of special support. 
In general; the main force that keeps apple and windows afloat is patent and copyright, both of which are strong centralization forces. 
If some company or cartel of companies where to form around non-copyright non-patent platforms however, they could lock the monopolists out of the industry by simply being better.
I could see a ecosystem which looks more like steambox / chromebook / etc - an open source platform supported by a variety of companies none with a central monopoly. Ubuntu has long tried to be the "apple of linux" but they have been run too much like a charity and simply havent found business niches. 
The tide has been slowly rising none the less, so I dont think the present state will last forever. small things, like being completely unsecurable, will chip away at the monopolists.

It also hasnt dropped to depression levels - which was a great achievement.


If any of the banks or recipients of large amounts of cash did something besides park it in treasuries or already-listed stocks, it would cause a "fiat leak". 
Those dollars pouring out into the wider market of goods and services would then cause inflation in more areas than simply asset prices, but also wages and everyday commodities. 
We saw this fairly steadily in the 70's; stagflation. If it happens in a weaker economy it can become outright hyperinflation.
However, under the last decade of QE, banks have been reluctant lenders, so the money has stayed locked in asset pools.


It remains to be seen; Japan has blazed a trail into further QE that the USA might be able to follow.
If you look how far Japan has taken QE, the next logical question is what happens to the market when the government owns nearly 100% of all assets.

There are a number of way that should immediately spring to mind if you have used bitcoin at all.

The way joinmarket is used, the change amounts essentially leak enough information to correlate ownership across joins. Read the original 


Personally, I dont think that feature is very useful for what it aims to do. 
One of the biggest weaknesses is the final sweep; if someone takes a starting amount of BTC, tumbles it via the JM tumbler script, then sweeps it off to their normal wallet, then it may provide nearly no privacy at all.

Its already being used for remittance, and I expect soon for international invoicing and settlement. There is also a fledgling cottage industry in international payroll. Bitcoin is functioning as a safe haven asset in places like venezuela, but at a very small scale due to their shattered economy. Really, its only used in places where current systems show major weaknesses.
 
But that is all small potatoes. Bitcoin is part of the Austrian economics/ Sound money movement. The scope of what we expect to change is far bigger than what we have seen so far. The changes we anticipate cut to the very core of finance and politics, and the way money itself works.
Its not just a new tech; its an attempt to end the credit cycle which has dominated everything for a hundred years. 


True; But as of right now, nothing else even comes close. In terms of development, technology or design.
