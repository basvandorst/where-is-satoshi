Psyched for this, as well! But chances are rather small that is *really* happens on May 22... That site seems to assume the median block goal-time of 10 minutes, which in reality is usually a bit lower since new hashing power keeps on being deployed.
I actually did some calculations when we reached exactly 50% of the halvening back in May: 
Assuming a 10 minute average block-time, the halvening was supposed to happen **May 28** back then. Now it's already down to **May 22**. Assuming the same perpetual increase of the hash-rate since the last halvening in 2016, my prediction was that it would happen on **April 17 2020**! And I stand by that :)

You can increase the gap limit, which defines how many "new" addresses should be generated deterministically from your seed. If your first addresses haven't been used, it doesn't generate further ones, unless you tell it to:

This is awesome. Just imagine how regular laws just don't work in that case. What if I just memorized the seed words of my Electrum wallet? What if I created an address out of the hash of the Russian Orthodox Bible and put 1mBTC in it? Would the book now be banned in Russia?
You get the gist...

Some people claim it's Gox selling BTC at Stamp. But this is pure speculation.

@_date: 2014-08-30 11:02:12
Exactly - Even if it is possible to buy fractions of a Bitcoin (which of course it is and always has been), it may be very important to keep valuation of the widely used denominator rather en par with regular currencies. It's purely psychological.
One thing we have to consider: People may compare the price in Bits to the 'old' price and think 'wow, it's value has dropped to a 1/1000!!! Must be when it got bust because that Bitcoin CEO in Japan screwed up'
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:38:26
Those words could be Electrum seeds. Before you figure out what they are, tell NO ONE what is written there. They could literally be the (only) key to the bitcoins. If someone gets to know them, they've got instant access and will likely steal them immediately.
Are those words normal english words. How many are there? Are there collections of them, each consisting of the same number of words? Don't tell us more than that about them.

1. They mine with their hardware. Because they invented the chips they can produce them for practically no cost. The block rewards are being forwarded to the shareholders (each share gets 1/400000 of the profits).
2. You can buy them from anyone who wants to sell theirs. You can also use a marketplace:  or you use fractional shares which are 1/100 of a full share:

Biometrics are no passwords or keys. They are mere user names. They *may* be used to unlock phones or restrict low-security features posing as an acceptable barrier to impose (in contrast to a safe password). But for a BTC private key... no. You'd have to imagine the entropy needed to do this securely, which is way bigger than the fuzziness and noise this technique produces (I guess)
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:14:19
I know, it's pessimistic, but:
    public String getUnknownPoolName() {
    String[] poolIdentifiers = new String[] {"THash.IO", "PHash.IO", "EHash.IO", "ZHash.IO", "YHash.IO"};
    return poolIdentifiers[Math.rand(poolIdentifiers.length)];
    }
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:24:42
There are several rules everyone agrees on: Only people who actually own the Bitcoin can spend them (Have the key), Bitcoins can't be double-spent, etc. etc.
Now it is possible for everyone to check whether a transaction is valid (obeys those rules). If it is, it should be included in the Blockchain and everyone agrees that this transaction took place.
Now, imagine someone wants to cheat - how do we agree on who's right? Miners solve very complicated puzzles, once they solve one, they may add all pending transactions to the Blockchain. This way it is incredibly(!) improbable that more than one miner agrees on to include fraudulent transactions or do something that is against the rules. Because if they do, no-one is going to accept their created block and hence they won't get their block-reward (25 BTC currently)
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:24:28

It just struck me while contemplating over today's chart. This has been pure FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) coming from Gox. There's been no implication for Bitcoin's protocol itself.
We're simply just where we left off. And I'd guess quite some people got burned while panicking.
I'm impressed, somehow.
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:10:25
Well, I did give an example in my last comment.
Apart from that it's really not about any specific company, but the mere concept of selling goods by means that try to appeal to primal instincts. I believe this really is a two-camp situation, either you like it, or you don't.
And of course Bitcoin isn't a company. Yet, any company using the name/logo/"brand" is fostering a certain perception of Bitcoin in general. Again, every company may do as they please in this respect. Still, **I personally**, don't agree with this way. And I believe many others don't as well.

@_date: 2014-10-09 13:07:09
Well, the system - Bitfinex - effectively guarantees the lender that they will get their money/BTC back. So there's an inherent price (depending on the leverage) at which the Bitcoins **have** to be bought back, or the lender wouldn't get back what they lent initially.
A soon as this price has been crossed, the position gets margin-called and the Bitcoins will be force-bought for the lender.
This may result in a cascade, and the price rises very violently!

Many. Basically every company that features women in their commercials who adhere to the typical beauty scheme, instead of looking simply friendly and nice. I would rather spend time with someone I can connect to intellectually.
What do those women have to do with the product? What are the *actual* advantages of the product in everyday life? Does the company have to appeal to instincts that have nothing to do with the product? I'm under the constant impression that they're trying to fool me. Simply seems unprofessional.
Example: At an exhibition where Samsung was presenting their products. Giant booth. All the women present wore the same, rather short *uniform* which simply looked unprofessional. Without entering a sexualisation and/or sexism debate here.
Conclusion tl;dr: We may want to consider a professional (or witted) way of addressing people. Teens' pipe-dreams are going to throw Bitcoin's public perception right back into the realms of nerdy basements.

Oh, and to ELI5: Computers need to store words, characters, numbers, etc by using bits. To store the non-natural number 0.35 you can opt to do different things: Store the number as a natural number 35 and shift the decimal point two times to the right. No information is lost.
A floating point number, on the other hand, has (depending on the operating system and processor) 32 bits to store a number (4294967296 possible numbers in total!!!).  That's not a lot if you want to keep places after the decimal point - just think about it. Because of that it stores the number as a combination of two numbers that are being multiplied with each other. This allows for a far bigger space of numbers we can store (still only 4294967296 possibilities of course, but they can be more arbitrarily spread.)
**The giant caveat now is that if we store a number, we don't store exactly that number**, but a number very close to the one we try to store (because of the limited number of possibilities). If we now add multiple floating point numbers, those errors sum up, and we potentially don't know how many BTC we have.
I don't even want to begin thinking about the goxequences...

Bitcoin won't matter there when it isn't relatively easily accessible.

Well, he blamed Tx-malleability before when in fact Gox's system didn't pay attention.
He could now blame hackers for a 'relatively' minor theft of coins, while - in fact - he has problems retrieving the private keys.
I really don't know what to make of this. I mean, I bet Gox is over. But Karpeles just seems so reluctant to give up and keeps on insisting things aren't over. He either still believes he can turn this ship around (and maybe is delusional in doing so) or he just messes with everyone (but why??? **WHY**???)

They could just create a PayPal escrow service that forwards the BTC to the buyer as soon as the transaction is finished. There wouldn't be a need for chargebacks anymore, since PayPal can be sure the BTC actually arrived at the buyer. Hell, they could even just monitor the receiving address and deny chargebacks as soon as the BTC arrived at the buyer.
I know, they'd be taking fees and everything, but hey... adoption. And people have PayPal accounts, they *trust* PayPal...

Yes, if you've found a solution it is trivial to verify it is a correct one.

- How many 1 TH/s miners can you produce and deliver *approximately* within the first batch? (What time frame will that batch be in?)
- Few people on the public forums like bitcointalk currently know about the status of AM's gen 3 chips. What can you confirm: Tape out has succeeded? You have physical sample chips being tested right now? AM has batches of gen 3 chips being produced right now? What are your guesses on the quantity of the current batches?
Your product is just being developed very quickly, before everyone else's (even AM) - so the public doesn't even know whether chips are confirmed to be working. Please help clear this up and **keep up the good work on that miner**! Thanks a lot!

A lot of them are, supposedly, verified and can instantly trade on your exchange. If you're ramping up the whole thing under a new management and do some clever PR, I guess a lot of people will stay there.

ASICMiner plans on moving their business to selling their chips, while retaining a certain amount for a continuation of their own mining business.

I run a full node on a 50 Mbit/s down &amp; 10 Mbit/s up connection with reconnects every 24h (enforced by provider) that cut off existing nodes once a day, and my node makes about **5 GB downstream** and **50 GB upstream** traffic per month on average at the moment. This may become more, once TX-volumes, trade-volumes and general interest in BTC go up again, though.

OP said that she asked him to buy them *a year ago*! If they were worth $20000 back then like he said, they're now worth $1m

Maybe they should just go and burn all those remaining BTC :)

Still not a decentralized currency and if your apartment burns down the money is gone. You can split up private keys and even encrypt them with a passphrase.

I do the same with certain items that I put in the fridge. Couple of days ago I had the fun of taking out some 3.9k dough for rolls again. Crazy, I thought I was the only one to do this.

This means that it will now take 52500 blocks to reach block 630000 and make the block reward drop to 6.25 BTC. The decreased supply may then result in a price increase in the following time.
Reaching the halving now should take about one year - mostly depending on how much hash rate is being added/removed to/from the network, and also a bit of variance.

What's the deal with Bitcoin?

Immediately tempted to buy more... Gee, I can get so _many_ mBTC for 1000 Euro
