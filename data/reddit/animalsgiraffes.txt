whats wrong with the BitShares blockchain security? 
this is the first time ive heard anything negative about it - in fact im pretty sure sergio lerner is a security consultant on the project. from what i can tell both software AND financial security are a top priority for the BitShares team

Yeah, I'm really looking forward to the introduction of BitAssets as well...
But for now I gotta say the near-instant confirmation times are pretty damn impressive. I just sent 100 XTS from one of my wallets to another and the transaction was sent, confirmed by 13 delegates, and received in less than 5 seconds

Bummer. Thanks for clarifying, I wasn't really sure what a top-up was.

I think the implication here is that once you have obtained BTS/bitUSD/bitBTC you can store them on the decentralized exchange without having to worry about it being compromised. 
You are correct though, there is still exposure to centralized BTC exchanges in order to obtain these assets, but once you have them they can all be safely stored on the decentralized exchange.

A word about the interviewee:
Li Xiaolai serves as a Director at Invictus Innovations, a newly founded company that specializes in cryptos and DACs. Invictus released their first crypto-asset, ProtoShares, about one month ago. Despite it's infancy, ProtoShares market cap is already $30 million strong. The reason? Without getting technical, ProtoShares effectively gives you a stake in every product and service the company will release. With talented entrepreneurs like Li involved, I would recommend checking out ProtoShares before it's too late :)
