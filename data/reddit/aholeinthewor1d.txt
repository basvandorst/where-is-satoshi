Yes. Every trade is taxable
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:49:06
Won't need Coinbase when FairX launches. Won't need any other exchange
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:13:42
The math would be a lot different. You can hold the BTC until 10k but what if instead once it hits 3k you bought a few different altcoins. You got lucky and all of them made decent profit. Then you did the same thing again. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:41:44
This is great and the link works but I am unable to actually download the file??
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:00:22
This. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:56:54
It does make a difference
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:04:15
That's what makes sense and from my understanding that's how people thought it was last year. Why all this fuss about crypto to crypto trades being taxable then? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:58:27
He owes tax on every single trade he did in 2017. This has been made clear.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:04:19
Um that sounds like smart investing to me. If there's a low price coin with small market cap, room to grow, and has a good team then who wouldn't want to make some crazy profits.. there's a better chance XLM for example will double current value compared to Bitcoin doubling value. I have nothing against bit coin but what would be stupid would be to invest in Bitcoin and only Bitcoin. Considering it's no different than other coins at this point. Outdated tech and slow and isn't actually used for anything anymore.. just a store of value
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:27:29
Every single trade crypto for another crypto is taxable. You trade BTC for ETH and hold for a month. You're up $1000 and then trade ETH for something else. You now owe tax on that $1000
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:21:15
Well.. if you pick a coin in the top 20  that's a few cents it's a lot more likely to double than Bitcoin doubling. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:19:59
I just don't understand how it's possible to figure this out. If every crypto to crypto trade is taxable.. couldn't you put in $1000 and make hundreds/thousands of trades and end up with $500 at the end of the year but still owe thousands in taxes? Maybe you made tons and tons of profits but slowly lost most throughout the year 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:20:28
EXACTLY what I have been trying to figure out for days.. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:13:52
The math would be completely different. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:24:23
There no denying that there are tons of legit coins that have way better tech than Bitcoin.. will they get as big? No. I never said Bitcoin was going anywhere. Just funny when people think everything but Bitcoin sucks. People are here to make money. No one cares about sending $10 to someone and paying $40 in fees and waiting 3 days hoping it goes through. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:38:25
Anyone? Lol
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:42:06
I don't understand why people are still with Bitcoin when there are better alt coins with way better tech and faster transactions
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:02:55
It's the future of money!
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:21:52
I have Coinbase, Gdax, and Binance. No crypto yet though. Just checked Gemini and still not verified. Once I log in it says "We are verifying your identity and will be in touch shortly. Gemini is currently experiencing extremely high application volume and there may be delays as the compliance team completes the review of your application."
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:00:06
So just pick a random online seller with good ratings and that's it? Do they just transfer it into my wallet? Also what is the best way to pay on there 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:26:17
If only I could get my ID verified on Gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:27:12
I have had to do this for coinbase but then again I just signed up and didn't add a bank account yet. I signed up for Gemini but don't think there's any reason they should need my SS number. So now I'm not sure where to buy from as a beginner. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:31:30
What is the point of this and what does it even mean
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:19:32
They get 12.5 bitcoins???
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:30:34
Hopefully my last question. Which US based exchanges support Ripple (xrp) and other alt coins besides BCH. I'm interested in Ripple and litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:15:18
From what I read even with lightning the transaction fees aren't going to be cheap. Considering how much media Bitcoin is getting more and more people are buying in. Is it ever going to be insane transactions for a few cents?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:39:32
Send one to me to get me started. He can have my macook pro
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:32:33
What alt coins are you buying 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:22:29
That's crazy. How many people typically in a pool like that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:58:21
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:48
How can a bank actually tell you what to spend money on.. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:12:02
If an ISP wants to start creating fast/slow lanes a VPN will not help it's not that simple. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:06:48
Thanks for the help! I'd only be buying around $100 worth for now. I'm assuming localbitcoins takes a % right? Also are there fees to transfer to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:59
I hope. I'll finally buy some.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:13:51
Coinbase needed it
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:55:10
Don't they require your social security number? I don't see why anyone would feel safe giving that up to ant exchange. Are there any that don't require that kind of personal info that are reputable? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:42
Litecoin with lightning
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:03:34
Absolutely nuts
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:36:01
How much did you have?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:09:12
VPN won't help 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:03
If it has the most potential out of any coin.. which from my research it does.. then I don't mind putting $50 in and holding for a few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:53
From my understanding litecoin with lightning would handle large scale adoption a lot better than Bitcoin with lightning. I could be completely wrong but that is what I read and I'm pretty new to all of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:08:25
Is it free to transfer from Gemini to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:09:04
Once all the coins are mined aren't transaction fees only going to keep going up? Doesn't make sense
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:51:19
Unless someone wants to put a large bit of money in now is there really a point in buying now. I'm not saying it can't go up but unless people bought in when it was really cheap it's not going to be nearly as big of profits as before
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:22:57
Send one my way to get me started!
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:26:44
I wish it would go to $100
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:56:23
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:41:55
Yea now if only they didn't take weeks to let you sign up
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:53:34
Do this. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:42:27
"I don't get it though. How is it money if you can't hold it" 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:05:37
The fact that fees are insane and people don't use it as a currency and instead and investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:30:49
How would they not be allowed to throttle traffic?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:58
That's what I'm confused about. Some people say you are taxed. Some people say you aren't but that you need to keep records showing the transfer in case you are ever audited. Who knows??
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:02:10
That's why you just buy small amounts of everything. Years from now you will make money on one of them. (Hopefully haha)
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:44:01
From my understanding it's not going to solve anything for long. Bitcoin with lightning and more people is going to be slower than LTC with lightning and lots of other alt coins.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:19:45
Thanks. If I purchase from there then what? Do I transfer to a wallet? If so are there fees?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:40:36
Don't have any... Read above
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:38:28
I'm new to Bitcoin and was wondering about this also. I'm going to be purchasing around $100 for now and wasn't sure where I should keep it. Is it true that if you leave it on an exchange you don't pay tax until you sell and that if you transfer to a wallet you then have to pay tax on it? Thanks?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:29
They want your social set number. I need to find an exchange that doesn't need that kind of stuff and that I can transfer to a wallet for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:45:11
Exactly. I'm new to all of this and haven't invested yet but it's crazy how complicated it really is. Exchanges, wallets, transaction fees, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:27:59
Hm. I'm new to Bitcoin and was going to purchase from them but this does not seem needed and they also wanted SS number. No thanks.. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:42:47
You do realize it doesn't matter who it is.. no one actually knows or has even the slightest idea what will really happen... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:03:46
Even with lightning there are other coins that have more potential than Bitcoin from what I've read. There are ones that can handle scaling 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:23:36
I've been looking into Gemini for my first purchase but don't think there's any reason they should need SS number. Besides coinbase and gdax what are some other trusted exchanges that don't need that kind of personal info? I'm only going to be purchasing $100 USD worth for now so I don't know if I should buy from an exchange and just keep there? Should I download an app on my phone and keep it there? If I do move it to a wallet is there a way to avoid fees? Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:19
Their wait is longer it even mentions on their site. My friend has been waiting 2 weeks to be verified with them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:40
All that fuss and coinbase worked right away with no ID verification. Bought $20 of litecoin haha
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:58:26
Yea and they all say something different.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:52:01
If only it was worth getting small amounts like $100.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:08:36
Wish I understood all of this 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:21:28
I'm going to be watching his videos to so I'd like to know where to start
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:55:54
Thanks. So can I purchase directly from Gdax and go right to wallet? Or should I just use Gemini? I hear it takes forever to get verified from bitstamp. I have a friend who's been waiting weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:05:23
How much money do you have to spend? Just starting to research Bitcoin and curious how someone under 18 has money to invest and how much.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:32:52
Now if only they would approve me. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:22:45
Yea I was worried at first but it looks like every exchange in the US (just about) needs this info. SS, drivers license, etc
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:00:57
From my understanding coinbase also has delays now 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:55
I tried earlier today. Even their website says there are delays. Same with bitstamp and bittrex and a few others.
