Whose mentioning developers? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:27:28
Oh jeez she said "Bitcoin is "in trouble"" on her post. Is roger banging Melissa? Tune in tomorrow to find out 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:55:08
He actually didn't say that. Said Bitcoin cash will become Bitcoin. He didn't say it would fail. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:06:48
Lol amen. By the way, do you want to buy my digital cat? Well ya can't! He's mine! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:58:09
But is it better than gdax? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:30:44
Ya I know 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:57:14
No he literally said Bitcoin cash will be known as Bitcoin. Didn't say Bitcoin core would fail. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:22:50
Sir it's been 45minutes- this whole thread is waiting on you 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:57:52
I was just trying to quote the news 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:25:23
Lol that's what I was thinking, have an updoot
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:16:41
Come on don't throw ethereum under the bus like that. You know ETH devs are working on scaling solutions. We can be frens?

I hear ya, my comment was just locker room talk ;) 
He's done a ton for Bitcoin. It's not like Bitcoin cash is that much better, lower fees, sure, for now. If people are switching to Bitcoin cash for lower fees, I guess they can do that. 
I would think that Bitcoin Cash's ability to scale into the future is much lower than Bitcoin's because of the larger support behind Bitcoin. However, it only takes one thought, one idea, from one person to change the game. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:04:14
Sometimes I laugh when I can't fully process what's happening. In this case, I couldn't believe my ears. I agree with you. It's a little insane how much shilling/ market manipulation is occurring in such a public setting. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:51:54
they mean the futures contracts dont involve buy or selling bitcoin, its buying and selling speculation 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:53:40
I laughed all the way through this - Bitcoin Jesus - kill me

Can someone help me understand what bitcoin transactions, the fees, the network, and the price need to be like in the coming decades when the reward shifts from minted coins to tx fees?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:10:40
Long live bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:29:18
Ya I jump from non to fiction a lot. Just read Siddhartha again in like a day, it was really enjoyable. I recommend a relatively new book for non-fiction "Thank you for being late" - since you are here in r/bitcoin, it's a really well written book on the tech revolution (among other things). Cheers mate!
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:57:31
that's tough man. Might need to go get a new number

B2X was a ruse. BCH was the plan the whole time. BTC will win out. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:12:19
He did fork it truly, he took the code and created his own coin. He normally works on integrating new protocols ahead of bitcoin almost like the Guinea pig.  Or at least that's what I read this year. Who knows where litecoin will go or what it will be used for - anyone know? 
**edit I don't know anything about litecoin 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:47:58
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:32:53
Eth fanboy here, can confirm. Flippening was funny. 
I think it's obvious this is the S2X gang throwing a tantrum, taking a money grab. Honestly, they're probably making a killing. Then they will decide to move back to BTC, and make a killing again. Rinse. Repeat. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:40:15
Interesting, thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:23:23
It's not just these forums. It's not just crypto. Fake news, manipulation, fake users - it's rampant. 
That's why you need to buy my shit-sifter 3000, it's only 2 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:12:31
This actually looks good - have you read it? Reminds me slightly of the "Four agreements" and how humans possess the power of spoken/written word, and how we can use it for good/ how some use it for evil. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:10:11
this guy forks
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:19:57
I'll add it to my list. Might have to read it after  
which seems pretty similar as well. 
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:13:44

Typical they put the cuffs on someone just below the execs that sold more stock. “They didn’t know” fuck that. They knew or they’re terrible executives, fire them. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:03:07
Is your bank account located in Wyoming? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:49:52
This is good for ethereum 
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:49:14
Why would anyone want to buy BTC now if they can't exchange back into fiat? I guess for a longer term play (maybe shorter given history)
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:22:26
Yea, you're right it was a french website. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:01:27
It's worth it
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:13:29
Jamie Dimon's empty comments probably didn't help

Do not buy from 3rd parties 
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:30:49
Why because it's going to be mostly private blockchains hosted by controlled miners? I'm not sure I haven't read about it. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:55:32
All of this would have been avoided if the property rights and loans and data were on a decentralized blockchain. Any blockchain. Bitcoin's future is bright, and so is the future for the middle and lower classes. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:24:05
Touché sir 
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:57:46
Not really something a normal person would laugh at. People aren’t born drug addicts you fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:38:21
Lol look man we could go back and fourth all day. I believe addiction is not a choice. It’s a mental health issue. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:30:11
And why should we believe you? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:23:18
Lol people choose to become addicts? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:48:41
You are looking at the last traded price on coinbase, when you go to buy or sell, you have to be matched with another seller or buyer. You will notice if you put in 1 BTC, vs .01 BTC in the buy, you will get a different price - likely because someone is selling .5 BTC at x and then the next guy is .5 at x+10 etc. 
If you want to execute true to the order book, use GDAX.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:50:47
Why do you believe that? Just curious
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:58:27
Ya he hosted a webpage for horrible shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:12:25
lol that's great
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:51:46
Taking advantage of other people’s weaknesses and addictions is not a product of “living under an oppressive government”.  Ross was greedy and warped. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:54:46
He’s harmed thousands by maintaining a horrible website.

I live in the US. I bought directly from the UK based ledger website. Not from Amazon. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:50:19
He facilitated horrible shit. The guy deserves nothing. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:49:47
Rot in prison Ross. Countless people are dead, countless homes destroyed, countless families ruined, because of you and your website. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:25:59
But he directly profited off of it and knew what he was doing 
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:53:50
Lol Ross didn’t invent bitcoin but sure his illegal, horrible, life-taking web of criminals helped the price for a short while. Bitcoin would have made it here with or without him.

I am intrigued by the blockchain business analyst certificate. I believe I know a great deal, but it's hard to find anything that you can stick to a resume without real blockchain work experience.

Scam alert- this is a scam. 
Your poor (fake) friend should not have invested his life savings. 
If this is real, your friends small investment taught him a lesson. That's it. The strong survive. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:55:06
You are not very smart. 
He absolutely was a catalyst for evil by enabling the Silk Road market. Ross was innocent? Ross was framed? Believe what you want. I don’t need to research this shit because I lived through it. Ross and his *dark* marketplace were disgusting and he loved it. He wasn’t like , say, Aaron Schwartz. Ross used his intelligence for evil and greed. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:13:23
And for those who don’t know Ross. He’s a criminal and is the catalyst for a lot of evil spreading across the world. Silk Road made use of bitcoin and gave it value but Silk Road was awful and hurt god knows how many. 
Fuck Ross. Thank you.

I don’t care what most people know. I knew Ross and I knew SR personally. I said *I lived through it* to convey(1) I’m aware of the history and (2) I saw that destruction it caused around me. 
a fuck ton of things that were sold on sr would rarely ever be in an alley. And that’s besides the point that it facilitated the spread of this evil. The dark alley was now available everywhere you had internet. Ross was largely the reason for that when it comes to sr. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:29:48
Ross deserves to be thankful everyday in prison. Sick fuck. Merry Christmas you filthy animals.
