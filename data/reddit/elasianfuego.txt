You’re totally right. It all depends on what price it’ll fall to before that buy in happens. If it goes towards the $6K or even $4K “recorrections” that I’ve seen talked about, it could cause market uncertainty for those looking for a more stable investment. I could see this scaring off the continuous influx of new money that would be necessary to sustain a higher price point before the end of the year. Will Bitcoin hit $10K? Maybe. Will it stay there? Not for long. Will it get back to $10K in 2018 and continue trending upwards? Definitely.
Futures will make people money, but who’s to say whether that money will actually increase the value of BTC, or whether the house will reel all the profits. It’s basically gambling with the price, and volatility in the market could cause adoption to go at a slower pace than usual.

I’m curious why you think this post was shilling BCH. I wasn’t promoting it, merely mentioning the opinion that there are groups of holders waiting for certain price points and timing to cash out, and possibly reinvest in other altcoins. Perhaps I should’ve used altcoins in general instead of BCH as a potential reason to cash out and reinvest?

Even then, your analogy goes even deeper. Not to get all iPhone vs Android, but android usually gets new features and tricks first while the iPhone takes more time to implement said features and tricks in a more stable release. Usually. Android phones tend to be more complicated and finicky with reliability, while an iPhone will generally “just work.”
