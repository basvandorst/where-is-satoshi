You don’t have to assure me anything, as I never asked you about it nor do I give two fucks about what you do.

I don’t keep detailed records for your auditing pleasure but suffice to say I added up the payments vs my initial outlay some time ago, and saw that I already broke even  and now all the payments that come in (every three days) are just free money. This is very handy when coin prices trade sideways or go down - I am still getting paid. All the salty fucks are pissed off they went all-in buying bitcoin and got dumped on, when what they should have done was be smart like me and hedged with some cloud mining. You seem like you could be one of the salty ones based on your negative beta attitude. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:35:34
But the Trezor is of no use if you send cloud mining payments to it as all the UXTO's kill it, and they recommend instead running a software wallet on a computer for this. Core wallet it is for me. Hurry up segwit!

There is only one thing to do people. Everyone with an iphone or an ipad - I *implore you* to downvote this app to hell on the app store! Write your reviews and trash it!
Satoshi himself wrote "bitcoin.com is not bitcoin", and I believe this is a thinly veiled attack on scam artist Ver. We needed a benevolent dictator like Linus Torvalds, but alas we ended up with a malevolent one. FML.
P.S. This is why I fucking hate Roger Ver

Most people I know say they would be more in front if they just filled their bags (with bitcoin mostly) and then just left it, rather than traded.

I do believe that the price of bitcoin is accellerating, and will do so for some time, but then the rate of change will eventually be steady and then decrease and then flatten out ot near zero growth. I feel that is a long way down the track - 5 years at least. Very much sigmoid.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:00:33
Trend lines are trends because they are followed. For them to not be followed, the conditions that give the trend its shape have to change. On the supply side it’s very deterministic. On the demand side that’s more variable, and is at the whims of market mood, but overall the demand rate is constantly increasing. I have no reason to believe this trend won’t be followed for some time.... and when that trend line deviates I’ll edit my graph ��

GPUs will be better as then you won't need to buy expensive esoteric hardware and more people would mine making it more democratic.
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:48:35
The only hard fork we need is Bitcoin Gold - to get bitcoin off specialised AES256 ASIC hardware mining and into Equihash GPU mining, in order to decentralise the currency once again. Make it so. BCH, B2X, etc be gone. BTG is what we need.
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:43:11
He got cocky and made big bets on Bcash, and now that those bets have soured he's just a sore loser. Sad.
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:46:04
This. They do need proof of work or stake or whatever, or else the tamper evident database is not evident if someone changes it. Blockchain is nothing without the distribution, so that one bad actor cannot change the database as the others outnumber the bad actor.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:59:16
That's why there are mining pools, and with cheap power from your workplace or parents then there will be a lot more mining going on than you think, and not just shitcoins but good ones like Vert and Zen.

How abut ten cubits of a quart of an eighth of a baker's dozen of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:43:02
the 2x is almost inconsequential. It's the fact that it's a closed-door meetup of only a handful of parties, exluding the Core team, with limited testing, practically zero community consultation and code review, shady moves in regards to replay protection, and a regression in the core wallet version bringing back bugs. There is also the spectre that with the transfer of dev power, hard forks will happen regularly to move to 4x, 8x and 16x in quick succession.
End result is that only cashed up miners can afford to run full nodes and then the whole bitcoin ecosystem is owned and run by miners for miners.
Increased segwit adoption, plus schnorr signatures and layer2 offchain scaling (which is opt-in for lower fees) is the only way to keep bitcoin democratised for all.

Yeah soz I moved the market down as I wanted to buy more ehehe. Just kidding. Give it a week or two it'll be at 6k. No need to panic. If you need help in keeping a strong hand then just look at this: 
It was the correction BTC had to have. All goood - still on track for 10k end of year or there abouts.

You can tell by his jaded demeanor that he's totally butthurt by Bcash bombing out, and acts like a jealous boyfriend whose girl ran off with another man. He's completely self-serving and about as useful to the bitcoin community as a chronic scrotum rash (and just as annoying).
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:53:07
BTC is trending around the long-term parabolic trend line. If it went too far above the trend line, then the crash down below it would be even more severe. So in that respect it's a healthy correction. See here:   now is a *very* good time to buy, and a lot of institutional investors are probably buying in right now.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:17:06
Roger Ver keeps talking about "Satoshi's vision", and here's the thing - Nakamoto's vision wasn't bigger blocks - it was one person one vote. Everyone running their own full node wallet. Only a PoW change can do this. I wholeheartedly approve the OG's post. Then again - we already have Vertcoin, and (possibly in November) Bitcoin Gold.

What are the chances of restoring someone else's wallet - like Satoshi's original one that still has heaps of bitcoins? This whole seed recovery thing doesn't sound too safe to me. There could be brute forcers trying to do that right now?

I think not getting paid *anything* is pretty good cause.
Interestingly this Marco character leased 747's to fly GPUs into Iceland  and then the Ethereum price dropped right down. Sounds like he took a gamble that didn't pay off and this "hack" is a concocted exit strategy, conveniently timed to get all the BTC / BCC split funds - before he splits.
With mining in Iceland, incorporation in Hong Kong, and residency of the key administrators at some undisclosed location - it would be very hard and prohibitively costly to bring them to justice.
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:27:34
They still haven't paid me anything. The did finally break their silence and say, 
"we are sorry to tell you that we do not accept refunds as stated in the clause 4 of your signed agreement. We do not issue refunds also because we have invested your payment in mining infrastructure. Investing in cloud mining is not without risk and we expect our customers to be aware of that and do their own research before purchase."
Damn can't trust cloud mining when shit like this goes down. I did my research. I was using 2TH/s with them for a long while and they always paid. It's just that when I pulled the trigger on 15TH/s there was nothing on their website about the hack and no warnings anywhere.
It's completely unethical to not pay me a single satoshi and offer no refund. I'm effing fuming right here. Feel like there's blood dripping out of my eyes. Don't let this happen to you.
