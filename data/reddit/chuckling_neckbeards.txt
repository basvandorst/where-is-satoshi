also physical gold is being siphoned from the U.S.
@_date: 2014-01-21 08:14:21
yes, official reported. I believe no audit has ever been done. I think China is going to announce that they have double their last official reported gold reserves soon.   
   
Also, wikileaks exposed that europe and the u.s. are manipulating the price of gold    
   
   
China and India are calling the hand of the west by buying up physical gold.

there's liquidity sloshing around globally

When I go on that site I see most stuff going to China. I think it's clear it's because of time zones.

Don't think so. I don't see any reason why BitCoin should be the defacto digital currency when there are so many other ones. People in China are buying because there are a LOT of rich people in China and few ways to invest money.   
   
I can see digital currencies being used in the future but they will most likely involve some governments somehow. I used to trade, low volumes, low liquidity = that price doesn't mean shit unless you've sold your BTC for fiat.

CCP members are trolling the U.S. China will support almost anything that is anti-US and vice-versa. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:53:39
I totally predicted this. See my post when I said a bunch of rich chinese people were manipulating prices.

I don't trade anymore. I suggest newbies look at the bigger picture and take a side. For example the US and other countries will never ever stop loose monetary policy despite saying they will ease. A cutback in Q.E. means a drop in asset values everywhere, and not too long after Q.E. either expands or goes back to what it was. This means in the future there will be a dip and than a rally to new highs.   
   
The modern economy literally would not exist as it is today without stimulus from central banks worldwide.

A lot of technical analysis was useful in the haydays of the ever-rising market. For example, you could say when mac d is rising above 20, 20 and 200 moving averages cross, etc, it's time to buy. It would often work because, well, all stocks went up.   
   
I used to run backdating tests on stockfetcher.com to see what strategies would work best. But the thing is, all of that is the past and it says very little about the future because post 2008 is very, very different from pre 2008.  
   
IMO if you combine macro with technical, you could do okay trading. For example we now know that the Fed is going to ease up a tiny bit on QE. The last time that happened all markets tanked.

Eh? China is different but not that different from the US. The US has corruption hidden or obfuscated whereas in China it's more obvious. Chinese government is more accountable to it's people than the US I'd say.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:56:11


   
not true. religion one is true. 


   
Uhh... no different than the US except that the CCP gives at least half a shit about it's citizens.   
   
...lol freedoms.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:57:53
pretty sure the U.S. fed would like the same
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:55:33
How? I think they'd support it as it undermines the dollar. Americans live relatively well off simply because the US government can spend infinite money with no consequence. You don't think the Chinese government would want Chinese people to have the income of Americans but with much much more purchasing power?
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:26:54
wait, so you can pay taxes to the german government in BTC?

I also have some inside information. I work in Taipei and a co-worker told me that a group of rich chinese folks who have a history of manipulating (cornering) prices of commodities are right now doing it with bitcoin. Don't ask me for more info because that's all I know.   
   
edit: As an ex-trader I can say that it only takes a small amount of money to move the cost of BTC one way or another.

How is China totalitarian and the US not? You mean that no one can challenge the authority of the CCP? How is that different from democrats and republicans? Both are pro big business parties.

that's not true
