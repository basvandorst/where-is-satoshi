This is the right answer.
If you have less than 50% hashrate, then this it's a gamble. With greater than 50%, it's a sure thing.
Let's say you control 33% of the hashrate, and the exchange waits for 6 confirmations. This means you must mine 7 blocks on a secret chain. You are gambling 7*25 = 175 bitcoins to perform this attack. If you are unsuccessful, those bitcoins vanish because the blocks you mined don't become part of the main chain. 
While you're performing this attack, the rest of the network is mining the main chain at double your hashrate. The probability that you will mine 7 blocks before the rest of the network mines 7 blocks is miniscule - less than 5%. That means that, every time you attempt this attack against an exchange that waits for 6 confirmations, you have a &gt;95% chance to lose $100,000.
If you control &gt;50% hash power, the chance that your chain will _eventually_ be longer than the main chain is 100%. The risk is now much lower. &gt;50% is the threshold at which the probability of success changes from vanishing with time to going to 100%.

In science things are rarely proven; the best we can do is mount evidence. If there is any evidence against, it is false. If evidence supports it, it is strengthened.
So what is the evidence? I've named two big ones; people that suffer brain trauma and strokes often come out of it with changed personalities and/or impaired mental function, things that can not be explained with a brain that is merely a filter for transmitting information to a soul. 
If you don't know anyone that has ever had brain trauma, then perhaps mind altering drugs are the best example. Drugs like LSD and shrooms can best be described as drugs that alter your perception, so you might be forgiven for thinking them as evidence for souls as separate, but drugs like alcohol, caffeine, and aderall alter a person's decision making and ability to focus, things that are more connected with what one might call a soul. How can that possibly be the case if the soul exists separately from the body? These things are just chemicals, interacting with the chemistry of your brain.
There is other evidence, of course. fMRI allows us to watch different parts of the brain light up as a person undergoes different mental tasks. Nowadays you can even buy home eeg kits from amazon that read electrical signals and predict intent with some training. More sophisticated kits have been shown to be able to predict a person's yes or no answer before the person even realizes they've decided. This can only happen if some part of the decision making process is physical. What room is there for a soul? Why do we need to invoke a soul when everything is explained so nicely without one? What evidence is there for a soul?

Some issues I see:
How do you know "The User Router" is connected randomly? What if I own five nodes on virtual machines - can't I just say they found each other randomly?
Ask 4 nodes for route to content - This sounds like you're trying to implement Tor (hopping data between multiple nodes before it reaches its destination), rather than a decentralized content map (otherwise you could simply use a DHT to map requests to content, like torrent magnet links). 
Not sure what you mean by "money is generated" - perhaps this scheme is supposed to work also as an altcoin, which means you now have even more problems to solve regarding integrating this scheme with a blockchain/proof of work algorithm. That said, you seem to be trusting the internal nodes with generating money - how do you know that I, a malicious user who controls nodes, won't just generate free money for myself? Why can't I just keep making requests until a node I control is the Final node (should be easy if I make  a request for a file only I have). 
A user can always lie about the quality of the connection.
Edit: I've read your proof of bandwidth section [here]( and I think I understand what you're trying more clearly.
The main issue is what happens if a malicious user controls multiple nodes. Suppose I have 20mbps bandwidth at my disposal. I claim that I am providing 100 mbps to the network; verification shows that I am giving your honest verifying nodes 10 mbps. I can then claim that that only accounts for 90% of my traffic. Another node (which I also control) says that I've been transferring 90 mbps to it, so I pass your "verification" and I'm awarded cloudcoins.

Barring that, it is still possible to be safe. Scan your computer for viruses first.

The script cannot be changed in a way that changes the transaction's behavior.
Ideally, the script would be signed along with the rest of the transaction. However, doing this would require a hard fork of the blockchain, something that is simply not feasible at the moment. Although the alternative would be desirable, transaction malleability doesn't affect the integrity of the bitcoin network, and the merits of changing it don't outweight the dangers of a hard fork.
If you like, you can form your own immutable transaction IDs for tracking transactions internally. They don't need to be part of the transaction itself, though I agree it would be better if they were.

Not every person can or should participate equally. If you have incomplete understanding of a subject, then you should defer to those that have a better understanding. It's a given that few if any people have a full or even adequate understanding of the ramifications of every single government decision, and our current solution is a fine one: elect or appoint someone or a group whose job it is to understand the issue in more detail. Those people need to be paid, and funding needs to be allocated commensurate to the work that needs to be done.
If everyone could opt not to pay, then the only initiatives that get funding are the pet projects that most affect you, the payer, rather than the projects that benefit everyone. This is the cruxt of the tragedy of the commons; never mind that a few cents a year pays for inspectors that ensure our meat is packaged safely - no one will opt to pay for it because it's a tiny line item that you don't even miss until it's been gone for a few years.

Well the idea is that you don't depend on a third party to handle the transfer (or, at least, that the third party is decentralized). If you want, you could of course implement multi-factor auth using a paytosighash address, or have someone else manage your bitcoins, but then you're back to having another party handle your money. 
Of course it's a double-edged sword; the same is true of cash. I could get mugged or lose my wallet or my mattress with all my life savings (heh) could go up in flames and it would all just disappear. I don't think anyone disputes that there are both upsides and downsides to using cash rather than a banking service.

Ah, you're right of course. More accurately, you lose as many off-chain blocks as you make until you decide to give up. If you stop after one block, you've only lost 25 bitcoins; after three blocks, you lose 75.
If you stop as soon as the main chain reaches 7, on average you will have made 3 blocks in that time - 75 bitcoins. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

That's not a very good example. Rules that capitalism on its own fails to enforce fall into the so-called "Tragedy of the Commons". The companies and consumers may well recognize that a given behavior is bad for the community as a whole, but if the behavior is positive for the individual then that behavior will be favored in game theory.
As an example: dumping toxic waste into a lake is cheaper than paying to have it properly disposed of. Everyone will agree that the community will be better off if no one dumps in the lake, but a consumer is several layers removed from the action; all they see is that Company A's products are cheaper than Company B's, and even if YOU buy Company B's products other people will still turn to Company A, so the person who loses out is you (because you're paying more for the same good, while others profit off of you protecting the environment).

That's not what "key" means here.
All iPhones are hard coded with a rule: "I only run software that Apple says is safe." Apple's key allows it to sign software, which convinces the phone to run it. This safety barrier only works if Apple refuses to sign code that gets around security checks. If Apple ever signs such code, then all iPhones will trust it and the security is broken.
That's a far cry from having a decryption key to all iPhones, though.
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:08:22
This is only one barrier. Security is about minimizing your attack surface, and this reduces the attack surface from "all iPhones" to "Apple's secure key storage. " It's entirely possible (likely, even) that the NSA has compromised Apple's key, but that doesn't let them decrypt every phone, merely bypass the erase-after-ten-tries part. That would be enough to break pin based encryption and get into this phone.
It's all really beside the point though. The FBI cares more about setting legal precedent than getting into this particular phone - if they really cared, they'd hire a local university to tear down the TPM under an electron microscope and read the key burnt into the fuses. It would cost probably ten grand, much less than the legal fees being spent here.

Nah, if one day all of the hash power decides to switch to Litecoin, then the rest of the network will continue to function without issue (well, blocks will come in slower until there's an update, but that's fine). And if you're referring to a 51% attack where the rules don't change but the miners are merely reversing transactions, normally there's financial incentive not to do that because you lose out on lost fees every time there's a fork. Here, causing other miners to lose out on fees is just a fact of life, built into the new rules. And we're talking about potentially really long forks - a dozen blocks!

Fox has nearly double the daily viewership of cnn, but nearly the same in the key advertising demo of 25-54 (319k vs 262k). Depends on what you want to measure, I suppose.
CNN has lots of clickbait, but their main stories are generally less biased than Fox and MSNBC, which tend to lean right and left, respectively. Fox in particular has a long history of publishing garbage stories, between the birther movement, Seth Rich, Pizzagate, and false reporting of refugee numbers under Obama.

Err, not exactly. If this were a case of two groups of protesters clashing, I'd agree with you that they're not terrorists. On the other hand, if there is a case that an antifa guy tried to gun down or run down a group of nazis, then I'd also agree that that person is a terrorist. 
Militants that murder cops are a grey area. Definitely militant extremists, but terrorism implies acts against (presumably unarmed) civilians.
Regardless of other cases, this case is clearly an act of terrorism, and any group that condones it is a terrorist group. I think you'd be hard-pressed to come up with a definition of terrorism that doesn't include this act.

You're a terrorist when you commit an act of terror (bombing a mosque, driving through a crowd of protestors, gunning down civilians, etc - unlawful acts of violence or intimidation against civilians for political purposes), or plan to commit an act of terror, or knowingly join a group whose purpose is to facilitate the planning and commission of an act of terror.

I'm aware of the stories you're talking about, and you're misrepresenting them here. The Trump vacation story actually did mention that the White House was under renovation, but the only reason it was news is because Trump has now taken more vacation in his first six months than any modern President, after specifically calling out Obama for taking too much vacation.
I'm not aware of a story where CNN claims Trump beats his wife, a link would be nice.
The two scoops story was an amusing headline (yeah, clickbait), but the content of the article was an interview Trump gave to the Times, when the two scoops thing came up. In any case, that's no worse than Fox's coverage of Obama ordering Dijon mustard or giving a salute while holding a latte, but at least this was covered as part of a larger story.

I don't think you're grasping what I'm getting at here. The antifa aren't terrorists. Neither are the Nazis. There is a pretty clear line where "terrorist" starts, and I don't think either have crossed it. 
Showing up with weapons is not terrorism. Clashing with a rival group is not terrorism. Even calling out for violence on social media is not terrorism. If you don't see how that story changes when someone runs down a group of people in their car, then I don't think we'll ever see eye to eye on this.
Edit: I should note this is not my personal choice of definition for the word, "terrorism". This is pretty much what everyone means when they use this word. I'm curious how you would define it, that this event is not a terrorist act.

That's not quite how it works. BCH doesn't take some of the value of Bitcoin with it; it's worth what people will trade for it, and that's it. That said, it's quite possible that some people are holding onto bitcoin for longer than they normally would have (in anticipation of receiving BCH for free), and those people may sell and cause a dip. It could also be that people will simply sell their BCH and buy more BTC with it, it's difficult to gauge what will happen before it happens.

Perhaps you can give me some better links, because if this is what the internet counts as CNN being caught fabricating fake news then I'm pretty well convinced that most of their opposition consists of fringe conspiracy theorists and propaganda bots.

You have a few options. You can just sell on an exchange like bitstamp, which will take a bit of time to set up but lets you sell directly to others on the exchange to fill out buy orders and withdraw however much you make. This will almost certainly crater the price and you'll get a lot less than 1.4 billion, something closer to hundreds of millions.
You could use a service like coinbase, which places withdrawal limits but offers a spot price to exchange USD to/from BTC (plus a fee because now coinbase takes on some risk). You can then withdraw about $100k/week until you're cashed out.
You could use a BTC card, which is a VISA card that lets you spend your BTC on traditional transactions.

It's definitely true for passwords.
For brainwallets, it's only true if the words were truly chosen randomly. Don't use a Shakespearean sonnet, for example - or even just "four random words off the top of my head" - you're probably a lot less random than you think. If you have a way to randomly generate from a dictionary (through some system of dice rolls, for example), then you need to make sure you've chosen enough words to be safe.
&lt;EDIT&gt; For example, on my linux laptop: 
    $ wc /usr/share/dict/words
    99171  99171 938848 /usr/share/dict/words
So my dictionary has 99171 words in it. If I pick five at random, that's log2(99171^5) = 83 bits of entropy. A bitcoin address *should* have 160 bits of entropy, so I'm not quite there yet. In order to reach 160 bits, I'd need log(2^160 )/log(99171) = 9.6 words from this dictionary. Round up to 10 words for 166 bits.
    $ shuf -n10 /usr/share/dict/words
    variability's
    clean
    circumvents
    import
    advice's
    headers
    Zomba
    Sana
    zithers
    unctions
This would be a secure brainwallet, assuming my laptop's random number generator isn't compromised.
&lt;EDIT 2&gt; I'm having some fun with this.
Let's use Romeo and Juliet as our wordlist: 
    $ wget -q -O-  | tr ' ' '
' | sort | uniq | wc
        8019 8017 60712
There are 8019 unique words in the gutenberg plain text copy of Romeo and Juliet (by the way, this is why having a proper shell is a godsend: I can build a script that does something unique and useful in a single line of code by connecting programs together with pipes!). So we need log(2^160 )/log(8019) = 12.3 words, let's make it 13. We only need 3 more words to match the entropy, even with a far smaller dictionary! This demonstrates why using numbers in addition to letters doesn't help very much - increasing the number of *types* of symbols is far less useful than increasing the number of total symbols used in the password. So, 13 words from R&amp;J:
    $ wget -q -O-  | tr ' ' '
' | sort | uniq | shuf -n13
    butcher
    Citizens.
    hurt?
    child,
    reverse
    messenger
    weapons.
    very
    weraday!
    Father
    scarce
    collection.
    hark
~~&lt;EDIT 3&gt; Make sure you use a good source of randomness, as shuf by default apparently doesn't use a secure generator. I'd add --random-source=/dev/random to the above commands, but it will be slow - make sure you jiggle your mouse a bunch to generate randomness.~~

You may have missed my edit. Here it is again:
Let's suppose you have 1 BTC, $1000 dollars in your bank account, and a sandwich account with $10 of stuff in it. Does it matter whether that sandwich account contains bitcoins or dollars? Of course not. Either way, you're turning $10 of stuff into sandwiches.
None of what you wrote is relevant. I'm saying that it doesn't matter whether you use BTC or dollars to buy sandwiches. You were going to exchange $5 of *something* for a sandwich. If you know with certainty that BTC is going to go up, and that future value is worth more to you than a sandwich is now, then you should either A) keep the bitcoin or B) turn the dollars into bitcoin. It doesn't matter what tokens of value you started with, only what you end up with.
And, for what it's worth, "holding" on this subreddit is just the opposite of spending. So if you're talking about spending bitcoin, you're by definition talking about "holding" (or "not spending", if you prefer).

Holding dollars instead of BTC is irrational for precisely the same reason. That's my point; if spending BTC is irrational, so is having dollars.

You have to buy them on an exchange. If you're in the US, coinbase is probably easiest. You could also use localbitcoins, which is like craigslist - you'll meet someone in person and trade cash for btc. It can be sketchy (like any in-person trade), but it's how I got started.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:16:25


Exactly. And I'm saying that if it was worth it to hold onto that bitcoin, then it was worth it to switch dollars into the same amount of bitcoin. Again, there's no distinction here. It doesn't matter how you reach the endpoint, the result is the same. The person that paid with bitcoins ends up in exactly the same position as the person that paid with dollars instead.


Well, that's disappointing. I guess I can't reach everybody.

That said, it definitely felt kind of like a drug deal - meeting in the whole foods parking lot, handing him cash in exchange for a mystery product then leaving. I've since switched to coinbase, but I can totally see people being sketched out by localbitcoins even if their interactions are with totally well-meaning and professional people.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:27:48
Why buy anything that's not BTC if you could have bought BTC and it would have doubled?
Alright, let's step through this one step at a time.
Person A holds money only in BTC, no dollars. He uses BTC to buy a sandwich. If he had not bought the sandwich, he would have $225 in extra assets.
Person B holds money only in dollars, no BTC. He uses dollars to buy a sandwich. Had he not bought the sandwich, he could have his choice of either $5 (if he keeps them in dollars) or $225 in extra assets if he instead buys BTC.
At the end of the day, there is no difference between A and B. If you know with confidence that BTC will increase, then it is equally irrational to trade BTC for a sandwich as it is to trade dollars for a sandwich instead of dollars for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:50:55
But you can just as well say, "I shouldn't have been holding dollars, because if I put it into Bitcoin it would have grown to $275". If, at any point in time, you think you didn't get rid of your Bitcoin because it will probably go up, then you should be dumping your dollars and putting them into Bitcoin as well.

No, it is possible to fix transaction malleability without segwit. Segwit is an upgrade to Bitcoin that has several effects. Which effects you consider to be the main ones is entirely a matter of semantics.
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:12:53
The blockchain is the core of Bitcoin: it stores the list of transactions. Miners are awarded bitcoins for packaging transactions into blocks and sticking them onto the end of the blockchain. This process is designed to be expensive so that changing the blockchain (thus reversing or invalidating transactions) is expensive and impractical.
Bitcoin probably won't split into two separate currencies. There may be a period where there's confusion and multiple competing versions, but I think the community will eventually settle on one. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:59:34
Things are a bit chaotic right now. There's a mini war going on between proponents of two different ways to upgrade Bitcoin so that it scales better to more transactions. It recently came out that a major mining group has (probably) been secretly using hardware that gets a performance boost by exploiting an unintended feature of Bitcoin, and one of the upgrade paths invalidates that. As you can imagine, there are lots of vested interests here and a LOT of money being poured into convincing people one way or the other.
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:56:57
The upgrade is to allow Bitcoin to scale to much higher numbers of transactions. It just happens that this upgrade also fixes that exploit. 
Here's a brief overview: right now, there's a 1 MB cap on the size of blocks that can go into the blockchain. That translates to a few transactions per second (~4 tps depending on how you count). If you remove the cap, then people could fill the blockchain with so many transactions that it couldn't possibly traverse the network fast enough, so some kind of cap needs to be there. The two main upgrade paths are:
1. Bitcoin Unlimited: add a feature to the blockchain that allows miners to signal that they want to change the cap. If a certain number of blocks mined signal that they want to change the cap, then the cap increases. This way, miners can adjust the size of blocks going forward as network speed increases.
2. Segregated Witness: tweak how transactions get stored in a block, such that each transaction takes less space and there's an effective increase in capacity of ~1.5x without actually changing the cap (this may also be accompanied by an increase in the cap to 2 MB). This requires fixing a bug called "transaction malleability", where transactions can have their ID changed by people that aren't involved in the transaction (they can't change the input and output amounts, only an identifier that gets used to refer to the transaction).
Thing is, fixing transaction malleability enables a second innovation: if transaction IDs are immutable, then you can actually transact with Bitcoin without using the blockchain at all except as an arbiter in case of disputes. This means you can offload a bunch of small transactions from the blockchain and effectively increase the capacity of the network by many fold. This innovation is called the "Lightning Network". This upgrade also prevents ASICBOOST from working, which is a technique for mining blocks using 20% less electricity than would otherwise be necessary. One mining pool in particular has been (probably) using this technique in secret.
That's pretty much it. You can find arguments on either side for why the other side is dumb and they should go back in their corner and sniff glue. The discussion has unfortunately become quite toxic, with the community even splitting into two separate subreddits in response.

There's no quantum algorithm for any modern hashing function.
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:06:56
The absolute minimum energy required to flip a bit is k\*T\*ln 2, the entropy required to force a thermodynamic system into one of two states. This is assuming no energy cost of the state transition itself and no energy required to support the computation, merely the amount of energy required by any thermodynamical system.
 
Let's suppose your system as at the same temperature as the cosmic microwave background: 3 Kelvin (if it's sitting in isolation in space it will be heated up to this temperature by the cosmic microwave background). Each bit flip will require 2.9 × 10^-23 joules. Let's suppose that calculating a pubkeyhash from a private key requires about 1,000,000 bit flips. To go through 2^160 keys, you'll need 1e6\*2^160 \* k \* (3 Kelvin) \* ln 2 = 4.2 × 10^31 joules.
 
 The sun outputs 3.84 * 10^26 watts. Divide those two, and I get a little over a day of solar output. Not bad. Better get started on that Dyson sphere.

Quantum computing is only an improvement if there's a quantum algorithm for what you want to do. So far, no one has figured out how to reverse hashes with it, and lots of people are trying. They may someday figure it out, but only in the same sense that they may someday figure out how to break a hash with a traditional computer. There isn't an obvious way that quantum computers can help.
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:56:17
Alright, so let's go through these one-by-one.
The first one I've seen before and is hilarious, but not fake news. Sensationalist, yes, and dishonest, but no impact on the story.
The second one is a bit strange. The guy being interviewed isn't a CNN employee, but a cameraman that went with Don Lemon to Africa. Don Lemon literally points it out over the air during this segment. It's not like CNN took their cameraman with them and tried to pass it off as a random protester on the street, which seems to be what your linked video is implying.
In that third video, I don't think Anderson Cooper is saying that CNN didn't report on this case at all, but rather that CNN's reporting didn't say that Clinton blamed the victim. If you look up Clinton's defense, it's not that the child brought an attack on herself because of a fantasy; it's that she fabricated the accusation in the first place. You'll note that Clinton actually won that case, which definitely wouldn't have happened if the defense was "she brought it on herself". 
I defy you to show me an article written by CNN that actually has the contents of the dossier in it, or reports the dossier as true, or even so much as links to another site that has the contents of the dossier. CNN reported (correctly) that the dossier had been shown to Obama and Trump during a briefing, and left out the details.
Yeah, CNN cuts mics and drops feeds, I won't defend them there. They're not a perfect network, but I disagree that they're as bad as Fox, with a history of sensationalizing such groundbreaking reporting as the color of the President's suit, what sort of toppings he likes on his meals, and whether it's Presidential to salute while holding a latte, while reporting on such definitely-credible journalism as whether or not there's a child sex ring in the non-existent basement of a pizza parlor, whether or not Obama is a secret Kenyan Muslim, whether or not a former DNC staffer was assassinated for leaking documents, Planned Parenthood profiting off of aborted tissue, and out-and-out fabrications about how the statistics stack up in regards to gun control, healthcare, and climate change. Even if CNN is sensationalist, they at least push a narrative that's not predicated on lies. Just take a stroll through some of the statements on politifact to see how bad it gets on Fox. Now, these numbers can't be used to determine how truthful a network is in general (Politifact only investigates statements that can be directly verified and seem interesting to investigate, so there's a natural selection bias in there), but it's Fox news that consistently makes statements that are wrong, over and over, in the same direction, to fit a particular narrative.

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad bitcoin is doing well, but these bitcoin news sites are constantly predicting the new bubble is "just months away", so is it really any surprise that it finally happened?
Remember during the gox/willybot bubble, all of these sites had hypotheses about the bubble related to Chinese markets that turned out to be completely off the mark. I don't expect this time to be any different.

A mining pool isn't going to double spend at a coffee shop, and you've just migrated your attacker pool from anyone with "a fake bitcoin wallet" to "at most a dozen people in the entire world" with access to control a pool. Even if that is who you're worried about, a mining pool doesn't quite have that capability, since the network as a whole only spends $6000 per block, and the network is much larger than any given mining pool.
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:19:56
Did you read your link? That attack requires the ability to mine two blocks in a row, which is stupidly expensive. At best, if you know a lot about your target you can get by with mining and throwing away a block, which is still stupidly expensive (actually MORE expensive if mining is profitable, since you're throwing away coins instead of electricity).
Certainly can't be performed with a "fake bitcoin wallet." What does that even mean?
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:28:55
Mining a block is expensive, yes; it should cost, on average, $6000 to mine a block (otherwise, miners will build up infrastructure and then the difficulty will increase until that becomes the case). That number is approximately the mining reward (I cut it down by 10% to allow some profit margin for miners).
So to execute that attack you need either $12000 worth of electricity immediately at your disposal, or a willingness to use $6000 worth of electricity and discard the &gt;$6000 block reward.

Is there something wrong with these statements:
Each of the merchant's peers have one of the two competing transactions.
These peers will each try to forward the transaction they have to the merchant.
The merchant receives one of the tx's first.
The merchant then receives the second one, which contradicts with the first. 
DONE. If the above is correct, then the merchant has seen both TX's. The rest of the protocol _does not matter_. It will reject one, sure, but again - irrelevant.

I am aware of how race attacks work. I started off this chain by saying the merchant doesn't have you as one of its peers. You can't simply drop your transaction on it first; it needs to propagate through the network. You can absolutely listen in to the transaction queue and look for double spends, I'm not sure why you think that isn't possible. Just look for a transaction that conflicts with the one you have, and if there is one then don't accept it until confirmation.

Their peers pass them the unconfirmed transaction. To double spend, you must now submit another transaction before confirmation.  But there's a problem; a client only forwards transactions that don't conflict with existing transactions. This means you need to forward it quickly, before the first one has propagated to the majority of the network. This means you have a window of a few seconds at most to execute the double spend, and this action is broadcast to the whole network, including the merchant. So now there's incontrovertible evidence of you trying to defraud someone, within seconds if the transaction taking place.

Gold's "intrinsic desirability" is driven almost entirely by speculation. It's desirable because other people want it, so you expect to be able to sell it to them later if you need to. Yes, gold has some real functional benefits, but that amounts to a tiny fraction of gold's current market value.
It's certainly less volatile than bitcoin currently, but I wouldn't really call gold's value stable in the long term (Check this graph

The merchant is presumably well-connected. It only takes four sessions to reach half of the miners; you're still talking about the second transaction appearing within the ten seconds it takes to reach the door, and then you have to hope miners accept that over the actual transaction, and the longer you wait before attempting the attack the less the other spend will propagate. Even assuming you attempt it every time you spend something, all of your attempts will have been recorded on camera.
It's  unsurprising that they are frequent; people will try whatever method they can to gain coins. But performing a race attack in a whole foods requires you to run away ASAP. if you're doing that you might as well just shoplift, or do a charge back on your visa.

Log scale is perfect for volatility, as percent changes appear the same size no matter where they are. A linear scale would give the appearance of less volatility in the past  because raw dollar amounts were smaller, so a drop from $30 to $2 would appear less than a drop from $1000 to $900 - clearly wrong. On the other hand, a log scale shows a drop from $100 to $10 as the same size as $1000 to $100, which is correct.

I'm quite aware of how the network works.
This is why the merchant needs to be well-connected. It only takes one of the merchant's peers to forward the transaction for it to show up. You can't split the network such that half contains your merchant and half contains your miner; some of the merchant's peers will have the attack transaction and some will have the good one. They will both be forwarded to the merchant, at which point a red flag is raised.
Heck, try it right now. Send two conflicting transactions from a remote location. They will both appear in your pending transactions in your wallet. This is because the network is very well-connected, and even if the first one propagates through the network well, if the second one propagates to any reasonable degree the probability is high it will reach you as well from one of your peers. 
It doesn't matter if the vendor sees your payment first; the second one will show up within seconds. At this point, the merchant doesn't know which one will go through, and they simply have the customer stand to the side and wait. The merchant doesn't need to know who will win the race condition; only that there is one taking place, and that can happen in far less than ten minutes.
There is of course an extremely small chance that the attack transaction won't reach the vendor at all, but does reach the miner that mines the block. The probability of this is very, very small. If this happens, then the person has effectively accomplished the same as if they had simply walked out the door in the first place without checking out; but before it works, they'll have to attempt thousands of times where they'll stand around waiting for the confirmation.
Let's do some math. Let's suppose that both the attacker and the merchant are connected to 6 peers (a very low number for a merchant). The attacker sends the attack transaction to one out of the six peers. We can estimate that approximately one sixth of the network has the attack transaction; the rest has the legitimate transaction. The probability that the merchant will _not_ see the attack is (5/6)^6 = 33%, with a probability of attack 0.33/6 = 6% chance of successfully pulling off the attack without the merchant seeing until block confirmation. Now suppose a well-connected merchant has 40 peers. The probability of success without being caught drops to 0.01%. That's almost 1500 attempts where you are caught and must stand to the side for each one that your are not caught, and in the attempts where you are not caught you have a 1/6 chance of success (or, on average, more than 8500 attempts before a single successful attack). This is where we get back to the premise of the thread: when is it worth it? For low-value transactions, it is not worth it to spend, on average, 8500*20 minutes (assuming you wait for 2 confirmations) = 118 days waiting to the side for the chance to reverse a single Whole Foods transaction, _especially_ if repeated attempts will trigger an investigation and possible fraud charges.

In the US, you can use MoneyGram to send money to someone, as long as you have a payment slip, which is like a piece of paper that says where to send the money to.
You can use BitInstant to order bitcoins, and print out a payment slip. Then bring this slip to a MoneyGram location (like walmart), and pay however you'd like (such as cash). Moneygram takes a transaction fee, and then the rest goes to BitInstant, who deposits BTC into your wallet at the exchange rate you agreed to when you placed the order.

Two main problems: 
- Lack of anonymity. We could solve our voting issues right now if everyone could look up all of the votes of everyone and audit the polls themselves, which is possible even with centralized voting if the votes themselves are public.
- Assigning votes. How do we give one vote to each citizen? The bitcoin method of generating new transferable units won't really work, since it gives more coins to miners and early adopters.
Probably the "ideal" way to do it (if anonymity isn't desired) would be to assign each registered voter a public/private key pair. Each individual would sign their vote and broadcast to the whole network. We would need to validate this against a government-supplied list of valid public keys for registered voters. We don't need a blockchain, because "double spending" is a non-issue; votes don't actually transfer to the person you're voting for (voting for Romney doesn't mean that Romney now gets to spend my vote on something else). If the network rejects your vote, that means that the government has removed your key from its list and is attempting to rig the election. At very least, this gives some accountability.

I don't know about bitpay, but coinbase uses the current bitstamp price with a 1% fee. Using mtgox to price is meaningless when talking about coinbase, because you can both sell _and buy_ for the bitstamp price (which is typically less than mtgox).
What you said is only true if you bought bitcoins on the most expensive exchange then tried to sell them to a cheaper one, in which case, yes, a dollar is "worth" 0.95, but that's only because you made poor decisions when buying your bitcoin.
I absolutely agree that volatility hurts bitcoin's spending power. But it's also true that you'll wind up with more value tomorrow than less; you can't predict either way, and if you could, you could make money timing the markets. It's not strictly a loss.

An exchange is a centralized place where people who want to buy and sell bitcoins can get together. The ticker price is what people at that particular exchange are buying and selling for at the moment.
That's why you have different prices for different exchanges; there are different groups of people doing trades within an exchange, and often there's a cost involved with getting your money into and out of an exchange (this reduces the amount of "arbitrage" - buying low on one exchange and selling high on another).

There are many people that will say that banks suck, but that's besides the point.
The point is you don't _need_ one. Why do you need a bank? Right now, it's a place to store money so that you can get it when you need it. It allows you to make online purchases. It gives you (very small) interest on your money. All of these things are rendered unneccessary if your coins are stored in the blockchain (except the interest bit; but most people don't make enough off of interest to even consider it in their decision-making).
The most useful thing it offers is fraud insurance, but that's only necessary because their infrastructure is fundamentally insecure; in order to spend money, I must hand a random vendor the credentials necessary to spend my money.

If the double spend is performed instantly, then the transaction will be recognized by the retailer at the same time as the double spend. They will see both the correct transaction and the attempt to defraud immediately, and simply tell the customer that the transaction failed to go through. Even if it takes five to ten seconds, they can still flag down the customer, as at that point they will be collecting the receipt and just leaving. Of they bolt, well then they're shoplifting. If not, then let them clear up the mistake, obviously we don't arrest people for simple errors like that. Attempting to defraud someone is a felony. If you're caught multiple times trying to do this, or you have an app that lets you do this, the penalty is worse than if you just tried to shoplift in the first place. In fact, every attempt is itself a charge which you have written into the public record. If you're caught once, the penalty can be quite severe. I don't foresee it being a worse problem then pretty theft/shoplifting, and charge backs.

They're discarded _by the merchant_. Which means the merchant _gets to see both of them_. The peers don't know that the merchant has already seen a conflicting transaction. 
Look, I know how the protocol works. I've walked through how the protocol will allow a merchant to see both transactions. If there's something I've written that specifically contradicts the protocol, please let me know. But for now, here's how I see it:
Attacker sends two contradictory tx's to its peers. They propagate such that one fraction of the network has accepted the first, the other has accepted the second.
Merchant has peers distributed randomly throughout the network. Some of them have accepted the first transaction; the others the second. _Both_ groups of peers attempt to inform the merchant of the transactions. 
Seriously, if you don't believe me. Try it. Two contradictory tx's originating from a remote host _will_ appear in your wallet. 
In fact, a quick google shows that someone has run [_just this experiment_.] ( 
What I've said is quite simple. It does not contradict the specification or the fact that each of the peers will only have one transaction. Please re-read it, as it seems you've misunderstood my post. Hopefully that will clear up the confusion.

He largely misses the mark, unfortunately. What is "intrinsic value"? He simply *insists* that gold has intrinsic value - people want gold for itself! Do they really, though? Not really; they want gold so they can exchange it. A very, very small fraction of people want gold because they can make it into jewelry/electronics, but that's an extremely small fraction of the people that actually want gold - certainly not nearly enough to cover the value that's reflected in the speculative gold markets. Its electrical properties and relative shininess don't magically protect its price from wild fluctuations; at best, they place a floor on the price, because even if all the speculators jump ship there will be a handful of people that still want it for functional reasons, but that floor is far below gold's current value - and if that floor is what Schiff means when he says "intrinsic value", then such a floor exists for BTC as well, as even if it doesn't become a widespread, accepted currency it will still function as an intermediary exchange for transactions that need to happen "off the grid", but can't be handled by cash (such as internet transactions).

A retailer like whole foods would be fine with zero confirmations. If you're going to steal you're better off just walking out without paying than going through a checkout line and submitting a fraudulent transaction. What are you going to do if you're standing there waiting for your food to be bagged and their computer bleeps that there is another conflicting transaction? You have to submit the double spend almost immediately, and that transaction is just as visible to them as your fake one. If you somehow manage to get away with it, well, now you're on camera stealing food. At least of you had shoplifted they'd have to comb through the entire day's footage to find you, buy now you happily identified yourself at the counter.
