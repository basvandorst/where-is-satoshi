You're the only one of the two of us talking about him. You might not have his dick down your throat but you certainly have his balls in your mouth and on the tip of your tongue.

You're pathetic. Seek help. Or keep posting to NoFap you pathetic sociopath.

This is patently false. Bitcoin has upgraded through hard forks multiple times in it's history.

ASICboost still exists on both the Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) chains.
For examples of ASICboost on Bitcoin (BTC) see: 
Which has been defensively patented by the above group, potentially leading to the same Monopoly type of ASICboost that was being lamented not long ago, and is currently being lamented in your comment.

That's impossible. You can have a hardfork that doesn't result in a chain split. You cannot have a chain split without a hard fork. Again, this is by definition not true. From the quoted article:


At least two branches are created at every hardfork and were created during prior hard forks as well. If a branch is not mined or widely supported, it dies out.
This is also why any version of Bitcoin Core implementation prior to 0.7.2 fails to sync. That is when the 2013 hard fork took place. See:  for version history and whether they are syncable or not. Also this chain does a great job of explaining why the 2013 hardfork did not result in a chain split.
Thank you for your input, but I source all of my facts from official websites and forums. I'm simply trying to keep you honest and help you learn, which you are not being currently. If you'd like to continue discussing, I'd challenge you to find reputable sources to your claims, as I have in all of my responses so far.

Some of my responses seem to be slightly off although they are backed by reputable sources, but the original hardfork claims are ironclad. Anyone with your length in Bitcoin should know that Satoshi hardforked Bitcoin numerous times. That's irrefutable and, ignoring the other rabbit holes we seemingly went down, is still 100% accurate. To claim Bitcoin has never undergone a hardfork is a complete fallacy at best, and a willful misleading lie at worst. That is my original point and it still stands despite your attempts to change the direction of the conversation.


That is a like. It was written a long time ago, and most recently updated today. When you make blatant lies in your arguments it makes everything else you're trying to say seem more suspicious. I've sources all my statements. You have numerous unsourced and controversial claims that I can not find any backing for outside of Twitter personalities.
Please provide a source proving otherwise, but in lieu of that I believe we're done here.
