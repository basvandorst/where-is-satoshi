I like it, everything on there deserves to be. You could actually put around 90% of all coins on there.

No one has given a damn about that dead project for 2 years

So we can talk about altcoins as long as they implement SegWit? I'm pretty sure Litecoin has it's own sub to discuss Litecoin.
The hypocrisy is real in here.

Is this a Litecoin sub now?

Give it some time, Bitcoin is about to get hit with the reality truck soon enough

Do you really think SegWit will just magically be activated on Bitcoin because Litecoin, a *dead coin that has been dead for 2 years* is implementing it for no real reason other than LTC was an easy target?
Good luck with that

lol what the fuck is the copycoin going to teach Bitcoin, both have the exact same problem. If LTC gets just as big it too will get stuck in a ridiculous stalemate some day. Good luck on your LTC bag holding though

lol you guys are so desperate and full of shit
Every time Bitcoin actually gets used for something you dummies call it an "attack".
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:13:54
Did this become a Litecoin sub again today?
You fools are getting taken to the cleaners

43% of the last 144 blocks is not the same as 43% of the last 1000

If the altcoin is a SegWit coin it gets a pass, apparently.
But Bitcoin Unlimited is still an "altcoin" according to most in here, even though it is just a client, one of many, and not the network.
