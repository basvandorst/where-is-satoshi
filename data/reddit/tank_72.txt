I love it
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:55:52
But still a good news ����

I would say first step in this direction ! If a government accept payments from btc — then we are on track ����

US shutdown - share markets crashing — let the world sew that BTC is stable and independent fron the old eco

My two favorites are XLM and BURST ... 
XLM because of speed and nearly no transfer costs
BURST because of PoC . I believe this could be like a btc 2.0 coin ...

If you searching for a coin without the energy demand — look for BURST and the PoC ; they compare energy needed by btc block = 450kw to 0.1 kw by BURST...
They also implement by march a fork which will include the advantages of  a tangle and sub-tangle as also smart contracts.
Coin exists since 2014 but in September 2017 a new dev team tokes over the lead — PoCConsortium....
For me a hidden hero which has the chance to be a new btc 2.0 !? 
Have a look and be inspired ! ��

I think this guy/girl/group wants to cash out ... and this is okay ...  but they should stop playing with the market ; placement of the complete size on a level like now and give the market a chance to buy — and to start on a weekend is really stupid... volume is better on working days

We should all help ... just everyone in this community should just  buy now 0.1 btc say limit 11k ... we would see it by midnight.... lets start....
Where is my creditcard ..... ah here ... lets go ...

I prefer the PoC ( Proof of Capacity ) from BURST coin. Here you just need some hdd to be in mining and it cost nearly now enery — DOYR and be on fire — i love this concept ..... ����
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:41:08
Good new
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:53:46
Letd hope for a real btc crypto fan
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:11:57
The have still PoW and not PoC ! So Nano is more similar to XLM
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:31:40
Ah and check this video : 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:24:07
 To start mining on BURST has a very low barrier ... just plot on any hdd no special hardware needed like btc mlning... this makes it really cool
And yes hdd costs but compare it to a btc mining maschine ; hdd prices are really low ������

Would be nice if btc would rise now — like a safe heaven approach .... instead of  buying CHF
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:44:57
I bought at 9210...  if you. Follow we would have a buying power with over 7000 btc — this will kill theb wallstreet guys .... future exchange is closed —- they will all get margin calls tomorrow ����

Yes and no ��
If the goverment  accept btc to pay something you are near to an accepted currency.
Control by goverment about you is something else which you can sort out with own political activity ! ���� has nothing to do with btc

A daydream ��������; but PoCC is working hard on it to make it real

I think PoC will be a good answer —  BURST is the first green coin using the proof of capacity ...
