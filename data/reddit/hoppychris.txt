My favorite thing about bitcoin ATMs:  
Is that they need a teller.  Someone's job is to be the ATMT.

I negotiated when I thought they were worth 1100 cents each, but then they went down to 600 cents each but I hadn't tied it to fiat currency, because gum wrappers were the future.

I would trust Paypal to keep bitcoin safe from everyone except for Paypal, who will likely freeze accounts and charge fees, so that's pretty rad.

Great title!  That'll make it super easy to search for later!

John Waters (director/creepy-dude/awesome guy) called bitcoin a gift card, and it's not that bad of an analogy -- 
"The rudest possible gift is a gift card. It means you think the person is stupid and has no interests. The only good gift card is Bitcoin. You practically have to be a hacker to know about it. I want a Bitcoin gift certificate. That’s a glamorous gift card. You can use it to buy hit men or drugs."

Sure, but the chances of sending it to someone else in their payroll system or that the payroll system knows about are WAY better than one in a billion.

Does this machine have a "sitter" yet, to stop an enterprising youngster from sitting next to it with a "cheaper bitcoins" sign?

Nice!  Where are you planning on going?

Remember, if you never sell or spend it, you have not realized any loss ever.

It is, because they didn't remember/bother to make it 0.09.
My favorite system is probably the one used by Ubuntu -- it's the year and the month.  The upcoming release?  14.04 -- easy and you know how old it is!

Don't do this -- a few years ago I agreed to be paid for my work in Bazooka gum wrapper comics, and it didn't really work out.
@_date: 2013-10-03 15:59:32
That would also line up with the "no murders in that town" thing.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:17:50
It would help even more if it were, y'know.... true?  Which it may or may not be at this point.

It's John Waters, "There's some new thing that you can use to buy hitmen or drugs" isn't exactly a terrible thing.

I have no idea why you got voted down -- it's not a bad idea, and connecting it with gift cards does make it more understandable for people.

Sure, give him some bitcoins or whatever, but why the heck does he not have a bank account?!!?  Maybe (not actually maybe, legitimately actually) it's absolutely more important to get him a bank account with "fake government fiat money" than to have him speculating in internet-wizard-dollars.

It's occasionally helpful to see the person who is losing the 4 dollars as the person that you bought it from.  They had the opportunity to have that increase in value, but sold it to you for one dollar (for whatever reasons they had -- maybe they needed the money more than the currency and the future price increases in the currency.  Maybe they thought the price was going to go down.)

Opie and Anthony care about bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:41:03
Exactly what I was thinking.  Especially in a case where someone was only accepting bitcoin, I don't think it would add credibility to their business at all!
Also, easy and fast?  Maybe possibly, unless the transaction doesn't get confirmed in the next few blocks, so let's just make sure it goes through fully.
I like the idea of bitcoin, but there are definite disadvantages as well.
On the other hand, maybe the poster and survey respondent is a drug dealing assassin.

Because the end of the article had very little to do with the beginning, and just sort of trailed off?

Using bitcoin wouldn't make it legal to run a hotel out of your home.
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:49:38
I really just hope paypal (owned by ebay) steps in to add some credibility to this whole bitcoin thing.  I'd gladly let them take a healthy percent and freeze the accounts of no-goodniks.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:40:54
I think you're using the wrong money supply.  There are currently a few ways to measure it, but it looks like it's about 1.1 trillion for M0 (which is just the coins and bills in circulation) and about 11 trillion for M2, which includes things like savings deposits, since you still "have" it when it's in the bank, which is a closer measure of "how much money do people have."
So....  
(I love Wolfram Alpha)
About half a million each if the value was the same.
But yeah, it's not going to be.

Sure, but you don't go around dropping the fact that you don't have a TV.  *That's* the thing that sets someone apart as better than you.
I mean... I have a TV, but only because I won it.  In a reading contest.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:46:41
He's great!  I was just reading this article and came across the Bitcoin reference, pretty nice.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:38:25
Because (see above) I am (mentally) incapable of spending bitcoin once I have it!
(Not really, I just had a reaction when looking at how much I'd paid for games when I thought I was paying less.  I guess that's why bitcoins aren't just internet-US-Dollars, they are their own thing).
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:10:07
phew!  You dodged that "actually never ships" bullet!

Although they need most people to be running a full node early on, altcoins just using the same ugly QT client definitely doesn't differentiate them.  Make one that looks nice and is understandable!  Is it just me that thinks it is crazy that namecoins don't even have a graphical client on Windows?

So it's sort of like getting a tip in starbucks gift cards.  No server will think of this as the cash equivalent.  But instead of starbucks, it's something they've never heard of, can't use until they accumulate more of them, and... hmmm
I do like the idea of it, but getting people to think it's nice is another thing.
@_date: 2013-09-13 20:17:34
Too true -- I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they hadn't really made a killing on selling miners.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:41:12
Well sure, and more people will use bitcoins if Paypal does start using them, but there's a difference between knowing that it's going to happen and being excited.
For 1 BTC I'll kick you in the shins, as hard as I can.
(I really would)
I'm another person accepting bitcoins, but that doesn't mean my service is good.  (I'm too small to kick "well" for people who want to be kicked, and for people that don't want to be kicked I'd kick to hard!)
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:12:54
Do you happen to buy all of the things he needs for him?  Does he babysit / deliver papers / rake/mow/shovel for non-bitcoins?  How does he use Bitcoins, and where does he get money for everyday use?
I'm rather puzzled by this, why does he want bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:08:44
The one big YES, BUT to that is that the availability of ASIC rigs is quite questionable.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:54:40
And remember, if anyone asks any questions that could potentially put bitcoin in a bad light, or if anyone points out anything negative about bitcoin, the hive mind shall not stand for it.

I don't have the internet and had to go speak to my local reference librarian to find out what this "Google" thing is.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:23:16
A great idea!  If you've been talking about bitcoins with your waitress or bartender, feel free to throw some additional tip in as bitcoins, if not, then maybe just don't do that.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:25:20
Oh!  this comment did it!  Made me think about the issue in a new way.
I've never actually bought Bitcoin before, only mined it, and buying it seems annoyingly complicated.
And as someone who has only mined, my thought process is "well, I'm not getting that many more of these things".
Is there an actually-easy way to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:48:03
Ooooh, can't wait for the 14-years-from-now Spotify of Drugs -- cheap, legal, and easy to use!
@_date: 2013-10-15 21:19:24
That does bring up a very good thought exercise -- let's say you receive the paper wallet in the mail, "in case of my arrest, etc,etc,etc..."  What then?  It's not like you can empty it and sell them off, those transactions would be easily tied back to you, yes?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:51:13
No, no, no...  what 14 year olds who want bitcoins *should* tell their parents is "I'm going to go outside and move around a lot more, I've been looking at this computer too much."

This is potentially the circle-jerkest painting of all time.
@_date: 2013-10-07 21:30:14
Maaaaybe, but there's also the idea that I don't want my upstairs neighbor running a hotel out of their apartment.  Or running a bar, or a brothel.  Sure, bitcoin will make it less likely to get caught, but it doesn't make it ok.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:45:51
yeah... after hit save on that one I realized it was a wee bit unclear.
um, yeah... so yes!  tons of people use paypal, but there's no reason to get excited that they can now do their awesome paypal experience for a wider audience.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:21:15
Or people who are just starting and don't *know* that they don't need full nodes.  You want bitcoin, get the thing that says bitcoin.  A few days later you might realize that multibit would be good.
@_date: 2013-10-09 21:16:23
Well not associating your name and other personal information with your payment does seem to be a way to prevent that information from being stolen.
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:58:25
And hopefully it's a picture of a *sample* paper wallet, or someone just lost their bitcoins.
But yeah, nice article, and not the usual extreme opinions that we usually see.

Or better yet, Weekly groceries -- still just 1 bitcoin!
