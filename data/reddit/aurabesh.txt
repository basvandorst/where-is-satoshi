And there was told you should cry more....well here it is!
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:37:53
You need a buyer before u can sell so yes it should. People are not having dollars/euro’s on exchanges in general.
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:03:08
When bitcoin has big value I think more and more stores are going to accept bitcoin. So no need to sell bitcoin for cash. Just spend it for goods.
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:40:06
Yeah i see what u mean ��������
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:39:50
You can break the loop by not knocking over her coffee this time!
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:44:01
Then you broke the loop!
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:06:42
Nope sorry, i probably missed something.

Isnt that your winning lotteryticket? 
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:32:57
We were at 20k before, clearly not in your graph.
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:42:48
We can be 95% certain that the price of Bitcoin will fall between $3,005, and $81,998 in the year 2019.
Rofl.....Sharp prediction ��
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:07:22
The usual scam posts.
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:23:00
Useless post? Or was this meant funny in some way?

@_date: 2019-06-23 09:38:55
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:03:36
Then you read the wrong articles..
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:05:35
Dont forget wall street bonus and Chinese new year!!
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:26:56

@_date: 2019-02-15 14:48:58
@_date: 2019-12-13 06:15:38
The silver is for golden comments.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:41:03
Be stupid enough to post it....
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:56:56
If you cant afford a safe or cold wallet you shouldn’t buy crypto if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:31:11
Fake if you ask me....
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:02:42

And this all at once form John Macafee’s boot.
@_date: 2018-11-11 08:48:26
September 6th.....
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:50:09
Articles told before they are selling because they are upgrading. There are too many articles about miners selling and shit. Its the usual fud spam to get the price lower. Nothing to do with denial....
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:46:10
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:22:48
We will go down more, but never crypto is dying.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:38:07
Why are you spamming those posts all the time. Your clearly part of the fudwar retards. There is no reason why you should otherwise with your 3 week old account.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:21:47
Are you realizing that China already knows but they are busy playing their own game?
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:24:34
Lol dude go back to your cats and squids, you have no clue 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:20:24
Or it is manipulating the media...and they are ready to catch.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:37:05
These are young redditaccounts....not rare these days!
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:50:38
India keeps banning, just like the China fud..
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:46:45
Not at all! Dont see why you would post this. Everyone who use kraken got a mail. So why ask the question?
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:21:09
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:45:19
Here comes something like Thekey (TKY), digital biometric ID, in use.
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:25:38
These chocolates again........and again...and again.. ��
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:07:59
People clearly never learn....
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:08:06
And maybe it’s going down.....or sideways!
@_date: 2019-01-29 09:49:00
Best way is to do it not now!!
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:22:07
Anyone seriously it would happen this month?
@_date: 2019-01-28 16:59:18
Hoe many times this is gonna be post?! You are the 147th. Here my downvote..
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:39:10
So where last year the prices dumped they will now raise?
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:44:08
Farming Karma with stupid questions?
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:29:50
Indeed a fake post!
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:39:23
Old, fud...get a life!
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:02:10
Not at his lowest point in months. Unless you think we gonna drop more offcourse.
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:59:41
Poor post tbh!
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:28:19
Not true
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:42:24
When is the fork?
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:24:41
Congratulations!! I hope you had a wonderfull day!
@_date: 2019-09-21 07:50:51
Indeed this!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:45:34
It’s shit and you have to read it before you now it’s shit.
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:23:40
Just depends where you live. You and i are probably lucky enough to live in a western country. For OP this might be a big amount of money.
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:42:51
And again 3 minutes of my time wasted...
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:43:00
Article had nothing to do with banning BTC....clearly Fud!
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:16:51
You have a very bad posting history, asking BTC to bet, living in bulgaria so not in UK...
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:19:01
And what about the ‘paper btc’. Recent posts about paper btc and paper gold kinda worry me..
@_date: 2019-05-29 18:23:02
@_date: 2019-05-22 18:33:02
And get scammed for free?
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:51:23
Ehh no...?! Have a nice birthday though!
@_date: 2018-12-23 09:54:02
I love snow!
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:36:32
Then this wall paper is not relevant for you....kinda strange question, not?
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:26:04
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:50:08
When you try to make a joke but no one thinks its funny.
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:09:51
Your sick.....
Edit: reported
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:43:06
