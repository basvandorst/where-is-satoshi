Con-base is consistently showing the wrong price, has broken charts on both Con-base and Gdax, did some shady market manipulation and most likely did insider trading.  
And right now they'r still all on a paid holiday from filling their pockets, so if things are broken, well too bad, better luck next year, which luckily is around the corner.

No, lightning network itself works off chain.  
However to get on the lightning network you first have to open a lightning channel which is done on chain.  
Your lightning network channel will have a certain amount of bitcoin (the amount you put on there) on it and you can keep trading back and forth with other linked channels, including the ones the people you'r connected to are connected to and even the ones those people are connected to, etc.  
(So if you are connected to a well connected node you don't have to open other channels).  
The other time that lightning network comes back to being on-chain again is when you or the person/entity you'r connected to close the channel, this is when all the bitcoin in those channels goes to their respective owners on chain instead of off chain.
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:36:52
That's why there is so much effort put into making lightning network, rather than a copy of our current Banks/Pay-Pal.  
I personally wouldn't call a solution like Bitflyer to Bitflyer payments a bad interim solution while people are still in the process of adopting Bitcoin/crypto.  
  
The main idea is to move from a trust system to a trust-less one.   We live in a world where everything is setup around trust systems, so we have to transition from one setup and mindset to another.  
This doesn't go equally easy for everyone.  
So in my opinion while we are making trust-less transactions be as "convenient" as the ones everyone is currently used to through 3rd parties like Pay-Pal/Visa.  
There should be ways that let people go about their crypto in the same way as those 3rd parties let them do it even though that means using these "trusted" 3rd parties for now.  
If people are already using crypto even before we can transact as conveniently in trust-less ways as we do through 3rd parties, then they will have much easier time transitioning to the trust-less solutions without having to get used to handling crypto first.  
I guess what I'm trying to say is that these kind of solutions help the adoption for the general public as simply owning (a little bit of) crytpo even if it is on an exchange gives reason to learn more about what it is you own and spark questions and conversations about crypto.  
While the general public still learns more about crypto, in the meantime the crypto developers can move things forward into making real trust-less solutions equally convenient.  
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:46:19
Absolutely agree with your fears and I think it's on everyone that understands the importance of trust-less systems to educate others on why we should be switching over to those from the current trusted systems (short summary: you can't trust people).  
I personally don't think that crypto can delay its adoption to wait on tech to be on par with current systems before we push for mass adoption.  
I think that adoption is needed to drive the development and get it sped up enough to catch up and overtake the current systems that we have.  
I think that adoption and tech push each other.  
More adoption, means more minds will tune into the crypto space, means faster progress, means more adoption means more progress, etc.  
As long as out of all the people that join the space there are enough people that understand the importance and necessity of trust-less solutions over trusted ones the progress on the trust-less front will speed up in tandem with the increased adoption.  
But yes the scary part is if the "trusted" parties will start to fight that progression to hang on to their power, but luckily that in itself can cause progress to be made on the trust-less front which would have to find ways to bypass whatever was come up with to stop them.

The difference would depend on which off-chain/2nd layer methods you are using.  
So in the case of Bitflyer to Bitflyer/Coinbase to Coinbase off-chain crypto transactions it is not different than Pay-Pal/(Visa).  
In case of something like lightning it is quite different as lightning strives to do the same with a trust-less setup (which requires the underlying blockchain to work).  
The previous is easier to set-up while the later keeps you in control of your crypto but requires more effort to set up.

Also important thing to understand is that a lot of the bitcoin price reports from Zimbabwe are extrapolated.  
Basically if someone buys a couple of dollars worth of bitcoin for a 50% markup if you extrapolate that to a whole bitcoin it would be $10000+ even though the person only bought $10 worth of bitcoin.

You wouldn't keep your BTC savings on such account, your BTC would still be safe on your cold storage.  
Just like now you shouldn't keep your BTC savings on an exchange.  
You would only keep a small amount of your BTC there for everyday spendings.

After watching some Koreans trade alts, I don't think a lot even care about the products they'r buying.  
For them Segwit2x futures are just another ticker on the exchange to trade with.  
They go in, when they think there's money to be earned and they dump it as soon as dumb money follows.  
If you buy in because of them, you'r the one that's giving them money that's all.

Nice timing, just before a hard fork will happen that in combination with current market players could potentially f*ck it all up.  
If we survive this one, you ll have broken your bad luck curse.  
If bitcoin gets screwed over this month tho, make sure to only invest in things you want to see crash and burn from here on, cuz you ll have proven to have cataclysmic super powers.

Market cap is not the metric to value crypto's by.  
If there is only one crypto on the market "Crypto A" with 100 coins valued at $1 each the market cap of that coin is $100 and since it's the only coin it has 100% market cap.  
Next day I fork that coin into "Crypto B" with 1000 coins and my friend buys one of those from me at $0.10 the market cap of this coin becomes $0.10 x 1000 = $100 just like "Crypto A" and thus within one day take 50% market share of "Crypto A" while spending only $0.10
So yes directly quoting market cap is a terrible metric to value and rank any crypto by.

Based on the direction that bitcoin has gone so far I think (obviously all of this is my personal opinion) that bitcoin will evolve into a combination of things.  
The base use for bitcoin itself will be store of value and it will be seen like stocks or savings that grow over time.  
The price, transaction time and fees for bitcoin will stay/become too high for small purchases. These factors will still be fine when moving bigger amounts of coins around, or for the times that you want to stay anonymous.  
The way that we ll use bitcoin for our daily purchases will be through 3rd parties.  
These parties once they realize that they have to go with the times or die out will rush the progress in this field.  
I can see companies like PayPal and big banks (probably a smart startup company will beat them to it tho) allowing us to store bitcoins with them, while allowing us to make small purchases instantly from our account like we do now with our debit/credit cards.  
They themselves would group up all the bitcoin transactions from their customers in bigger chunks and basically work like a bank.  
You would only keep as much bitcoin with these companies as you want to trust them while your bitcoin savings stay safely in your own wallet, basically the same way as we do with exchanges.

You literally refuting what I say without any explanation and basically saying because you said so.  
And if I say that everything you say is irrelevant just like in your case doesn't make it so.  
In this debate market cap was literally presented in a way where it does not account for market depth, yet here you are speaking for everyone and telling that everyone knows this.  
What I'm saying is relevant exactly because this is how market cap is currently being used, as a misrepresentation of every coins value.

In this specific case the point of blockchain is the fact that it secures the bitcoin which makes bitcoin a trusted source of money which in turn becomes accepted money for other payment methods such as this.  
Also in this specific case when accepted in its bitcoin form the sender does not need to convert their bitcoin to the local currency.  
Just like with any other kind of money you can spend bitcoin in more than one way so in this specific case off-chain, for something that doesn't require an on-chain transaction doesn't mean the blockchain securing the whole currency becomes useless while this specific payment itself does not need to be trustless (trusting Bitflyer in this case).  
So this doesn't diminish bitcoins use-case of being usable as trust-less on-chain payment options when it's needed directly from your own private wallet owned by you instead of an exchange if you need that layer of security for your transaction which would come at the cost of transaction/confirmation speed.
