I am not an avg miner, but it goes like this:
Bitcoin miners solve calculations, and by doing so are rewarded with bitcoin. If a lot of people do it, the payout is very low (a $500 dollar miner gives 0.12 bitcoin A MONTH), so it gives you small amounts of money as rewards. 0.12 bitcoin is a lot because its over 500 dollars with the current bitcoin price.
Now, the mobile version works like this: everytime you open the app, it has a claim button which you can press every 20-40 (usually 30) minutes to give you satoshis. Satoshis are like a smaller valued bitcoin, like cents in dollars (fixed, ty to another mining app, 100,000,000 satoshi is 1 bitcoin). Every time you claim satoshi, u see an ad. 
The creators are rewarded much more than you are tho. (Every ad = (lets say) 0.1€ to the creator, but you are given 0.01 of it). Now, when you get to your withdrawal amount(10,000-20,000),(the creators already got like 50$ from u, you get your small amount of bitcoin(yaaay)
This is what I know :)
Sorry if anythings incorrsct
