If everyone "opted out" of internet ads, our internet would suck.  There were serious problems with free content when ABP started getting popular.  I referenced Penny Arcade earlier.
Yes there are large mega-corporations on the internet.  There are also millions of DIY content creators that need ads to make their house payments.  Most people don't care about non-intrusive ads and have no problem viewing them to support the sites they enjoy for free.  If you aren't one of those people, feel free to turn them off.

It's not always a win for customers.  The consumer has to pay to convert back and forth from fiat (which may be a temporary issue).  They also lose consumer advocacy support from credit cards (ie no chargebacks).
Vendors should offer some discounts to make up for their reduced fees and no lost revenue from chargebacks.
To put it another way.  If a toy is $100 whether I pay with it via CC or Bitcoin, I'm going to pay it using a CC.  Because if I buy it in Bitcoin I lose 1% converting from USD to BTC and if the merchant rips me off I can't request a chargeback.  If I buy it in BTC I'm only doing it to support the protocol and not because it makes sense.  Since the average consumer doesn't care about BTC, they aren't going to adopt it until they see some of the savings passed on to them in return for their trouble and increased risk.

You rock man thank you so much for doing this.   A real life example for the internet to look up to. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:45:46
Exactly, and for that risk, transaction fees are lowered and the merchant has no risk for charge backs.  So part of that partnership should be a sharing in some of the savings for the customer.
Bitcoin is awesome but if the consumer lowers the fees for the merchant, and gets all his consumer advocacy taken away, there isn't a real benefit for using them short of wanting to support the protocol or trying to stay anonymous.
Most merchants are offering bitcoin discounts, not doing so is short-term selfishness IMO.

First: Excellent initiative from your son, A+
Second: Buy him something awesome from the changetip money after he rewrites the paper on Ponzi schemes showing clearly why Bitcoin is NOT one of them.

Uhhh he gave it ALL back.  And johnhoe is doing the same thing. It's not a cult. This is MONEY. People make careers out of stealing money. The fact that someone is doing it for free to help people from actually losing money is pretty impressive and worthy of praise.  Have you helped anyone from getting a few hundred thousand dollars stolen recently?

The way we're handling this case it puts us on the slippery slope. Where the state can accuse someone of malicious crimes (attempted murder), but never press charges? They can claim you are a dangerous criminal while never having to present evidence to show why.
I don't know if he's guilty or innocent, but I don't like how they've been assuming he's guilty the entire time. If he's such a ravenous murderer, why aren't they charging him with murder? We're talking about a man's life here, he should get more than a few days to prepare a proper defense against a witness.

To be fair to McDonalds, the vast majority of all hamburgers sold in the US are from the same crappy beef feedlots.
Actually, even the expensive steak houses still pump their cows full of corn and antibiotics.  Unless you get grassfed beef you're getting an unnaturally raised cow who probably waded through his own feces for his entire life. Even bison meat is corn fed now.

Not to feed the troll but in my brief experience with Bitcoin, the crypto community is anything but tight fisted.  Some of the most generous and giving people I've ever encountered actually.
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:13:54
Exactly, they should offer a discount to offset this negative, or at least issue the refund in BTC or USD.  I think they are potentially worried about currency price fluctuations and don't want to have to refund a BTC that is worth significantly more later on down the road (ie you pay 1 BTC for a laptop at $600 a BTC and then 2 months later you get a refund for 1 BTC at $900 a BTC).  But I doubt anyone would have an issue with using a USD conversion at the moment the refund is processed.  ie that same refund would only give you .7 BTC when they processed.

They could make it beneficial for both by offering half the savings.  For example, if they save 1% on fees, they could offer a .5% discount for people that pay using bitcoin.  That way both the merchant and consumer have an incentive to use Bitcoin.

Would be awesome if this was a major precedent set by the courts.  If they allow them to submit the evidence, we might as well throw out the 4th amendment.
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:28:10
No seems like the opposite. No refunds and even though they save on transactions and don't have to give cash refunds they aren't offering a discount.
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:03:34
Online merchants don't have the ability to accept cash. I bet if they could they would offer discounts.

Here's a good tip for investing, really it's the only tip you should memorize.
NO ONE can predict what will happen in a market with certainty. If they could, they would, without risk, become insanely rich, and would be incredibly stupid to tell anyone else about it.
Everything you read in the papers, on the internet, or see on TV is speculation; and for every person who believes something good will happen, someone else thinks the opposite.
Take calculated risks, never risk more than you can lose.

Also remember these are since 2011, BTC wasn't worth $600 until half a year ago.

I don't see how they are related.  Newegg immediately gets a benefit because their transaction fees are lower (Bitpay &lt; Visa).  In addition, they no longer have to worry about chargebacks.  In addition, any refunds they issue will be with store credit, which is another big financial incentive. Network acceptance is irrelevant, Newegg gets these advantages with one paying customer or 5,000,000.  The only thing that changes with market penetration is that a certain point they may elect not to convert Bitcoin back to USD, which would essentially save them all of their fees and be an even higher incentive for the company.
As of now, all the risk is with the the Bitcoin user and they don't get any of the reward.  IMO Newegg should either issue refunds in USD/Bitcoin or offer a small discount to make up for the fact that if they get a crappy product, they don't get a cash refund like every other paying customer.

Who cares, the result is the same.  If you don't like it, turn off "display non-intrusive ads".  Problem solved.
Guys like Penny Arcade came out and said things like, "Hey, if you stop looking at our ads, you either have to pay us, or we will stop making comics."  People can decide for themselves if they want to view non-intrusive ads or pay content creators directly.
How can you fault a company for providing their users with choices?
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:59:05
It's a fine line.  If all of the ads on the internet went away a lot of our favorite sites would stop as well.  Ad revenue sustains the internet.  Adblock saw they were having an adverse affect on the internet with their success and let web developers continue to earn money by forcing them to have non-intrusive ads, something we can all live with.
You can opt out of it if you want.  I think it's pretty fair and very effective.

Here's a unique service, "For $100 of Bitcoin I will give you $90 of cash."
Honestly I thought the biggest advantage of the MIT giveaway would be the start of a much bigger local cash for bitcoin market, maybe better apps for linking two people that want to trade.

There's a lot of ways to monetize on a huge user base of financial services.  Any new invention or payment system would pay big money to partner with them.  Think of BillPay, the biggest issue is getting the user base.

You're also assuming they don't have insurance to cover the theft...
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:25:46
The FDIC doesn't do anything that private insurance can't do. It was created out of necessity, because there was a time when if you put your money in a bank, and the bank got robbed, you lost your money.
Bitcoin's only been around a few years and integrated insurance already exists for a few providers. In a relatively short period of time it will be standard for hosted wallets.

That's why our government never "Allowed" free speech. They are not allowed to make laws prohibiting it. By nature that it is a natural right, one we are all born with, and can only be taken away (immorally).

I can't see how the cons of larger blocks outweigh the pros of fitting in more transactions. It's still a relatively small currency, if we're already having transaction issues then it seems like a no-brainer.
The average person, who is perfectly happy with Visa or cash, is not going to want to deal with two currencies depending on how much money they are spending.
We have billions of dollars of hardware invested in blockchain mining, they can handle the blocks.

What about using an altcoin? Go on an exchange, buy $48K worth of Dashcoin with your bitcoin, buy it over a few days to make it less obvious. Receiver takes the Dashcoin and buys bitcoin with it over a few days, sending them to 50 different bitcoin addresses.
The Dashcoin can't be tracked. So at least the sender is in the clear at this point.
But honestly for $50K I don't think anyone is going to extend the energy. It could be laundering, it could just as easily be some guy transferring between his wallets. A million?  Maybe more interesting...

Hatred of the US goes back to the founding of the country. Thomas Jefferson can provide some insight:
“We took the liberty to make some inquiries concerning the Grounds of their pretensions to make war upon a Nation who had done them no Injury, and observed that we considered all mankind as our Friends who had done us no wrong, nor had given us any provocation. THE AMBASSADOR ANSWERED US THAT IT WAS FOUNDED ON THE LAWS OF THEIR PROPHET, THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN THEIR KORAN, THAT ALL NATIONS WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR AUTHORITY WERE SINNERS, THAT IT WAS THEIR RIGHT AND DUTY TO MAKE WAR UPON THEM WHEREVER THEY COULD BE FOUND, AND TO MAKE SLAVES OF ALL THEY COULD TAKE AS PRISONERS, AND THAT EVERY MUSSELMAN (MUSLIM) WHO SHOULD BE SLAIN IN BATTLE WAS SURE TO GO TO PARADISE" 
It's not a black and white issue. Saddam was an asshat who used chemical weapons on civilians in his country and others, he murdered hundreds of thousands of people and was a ruthless, corrupt dictator.
That doesn't excuse the death of more innocent civilians but I don't think you will find a clear answer as to how to deal with that. Civilians dying from the US OR Saddam is a tragedy.  However, in this case, he had used chemical weapons against two of our allies (Kuwait and Israel), and was keeping aid resources from hundreds of thousands of starving civilians while the world waited for him to obey rules he agreed to.
War will never end, because the world is not made up of sane, rational, kind-hearted people. Some people are just assholes that want to project that onto others.
