Funny thing is that I just started a quicken online account and API for coinbase wasn't part of their list and I had requested them to integrate it.

I believe the issue will be pocketed for a bit. After the US truly has a the largest bitcoin volume traded and and companies centralized around it located there too; only then will small scale regulation begin. For now though it will stay untouched. That's my two cents on it.

The future is relocate to Kansas City, and work with google fiber on this. Can't argue with 1Gbit up/down.

I did buy 1 BTC from them about two weeks ago. It took almost a full week for the transaction to go through, but **I DID** receive it (finally). I think they're still pretty much in a startup phase and their BTC supply is too low, they probably don't have enough BTC in their system to really meet demand.

One must keep in mind that this most recent jump in btc was almost entirely due to cyprus. So one could expect a steady rate to gradual rise until the next eu country/any other currency, for that matter bottoms out.

I may not have many BTC but there's a wallet-less person out there I'm sure you know who could use that more than me. Regardless, thank you, this will go to my wife's first wallet. She's still a "non-believer."

They should just remake the first one. Nakatomi Tower Vault holds 1000s of Paper Wallets.

edit: 
"May 22	 laszlo first to buy pizza with Bitcoins agreeing upon paying 10,000 BTC for ~$25 worth of pizza courtesy of jercos"
Today that Pizza is worth over 6 MILLION DOLLARS.

Awesome, thanks, better than the one I use

It rolls off the tongue well. And it should very much be kept. I think homage has to be paid to Mr. Nakamoto, regardless of it being a pseudonym or not. 
Think of some kid 20 years from now in a small southeastern European country who's national currency IS Bitcoin asks his father. "Why is it called a Satoshi?" He can respond with with the story of the Genesis Block and the Genesis of Bitcoin itself.
