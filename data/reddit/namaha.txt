Actually, looking at the source code of the webpage I'm not really sure. The title of that collapsible menu clearly calls out 21 countries. If it had instead displayed a count of the "av1CountryContainer" Collection then I'd agree it was probably a mistake and someone put the same country abbreviations in by accident.




Regardless, this still has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin, and should not be on this sub.

Roads and schools need maintaining. Even if you don't own a car, you still MASSIVELY benefit from the existence of roads. You have to leave the house sometimes, and even if you rarely do you won't survive without having shit delivered to you.

Those coins will almost certainly never be returned to the original owners. As for the guy, it depends on who catches him. If Law Enforcement catches him, you can bet your ass those coins are gone for good. If one of the many victims catches him, well, that's another story (that will likely end in his death...)

1. Don't try to day-trade
2. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose
3. Use multiple-factor authentication
Follow those 3 rules and you'll do just fine

Because it will be wholly ineffective at keeping BTC from getting a foothold in the market. 
Not to mention they are driving away customers who used their service in the past to buy BTC, and any future customers who would have done the same.

He was actually identified prior to the tracking of the 96,000 coins, not through the coins themselves
Edit: And the reason the 96,000 coins were able to be tracked through the tumbler is simply because of the large amount. Smaller amount of BTC are much easier to lose track of
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:19:42
That is kind of a silly example since you cannot guarantee that BTC will be worth more in X amount of time
Also the fact that OP just said that he would spend BTC if he needed or wanted to. Really not sure what you're getting at here mate!

OP edited his post. I'm guessing he originally had "1 BTC for $400" instead of 2 BTC

Absolutely! Its their choice and I'm not saying they shouldn't have that choice. I just think it's a dumb one.

I had the same shit happen with my bank when I was making payments on coinbase. They disabled my online access to my account, and told me to call some Support line. When I did, they told me absolutely nothing about why a "security freeze" was placed on my account, and told me I had to go into a location to verify my identity or whatever.
Frustrating as hell. I can't wait until I can ditch banks alltogether

There are definitely ways for him to obscure the transactions enough that they can't reliably be linked back to him. He could also make use of anonymous BTC exchange sites like localbitcoins.com
He will definitely have to unload his stolen fortune in small loads at a time though if he wants any chance of not being caught

I know you're being sarcastic, but to some extent it is true. BTC relies on peoples' willingness to accept it (like other currencies), and "marketing" can certainly play a big part in that

A 3.1% transaction fee really isn't all that much. Credit Card companies charge about as much if not more IIRC

@_date: 2013-12-06 19:59:37


It's a potential loss though, because if you had waited for them to be worth more before selling, you would make more money. What's not to understand about that?


Personally I keep a reserve of BTC, then when I make a purchase in BTC I just go to an exchange and buy back the BTC I spent. Keeps my total BTC levels the same but still lets me use them in commerce.
BTC has taken big hits before, and will take more hits in the future. It's my firm belief that it will recover and then some.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:41:55


Absoutely. But then, I would also just immediately go to a BTC exchange and buy back whatever BTC I spent (at the same exchange rate that I spent it at). That would effectively keep the amount of BTC I own the same, while still allowing me to spend it
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:01:03

Well, BTC aren't technically infinitely divisible *yet*. Currently they only go down to 8 decimal places at most. The BTC protocol can be modified to allow for smaller transactions though.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:21:43
If the price keeps falling and doesn't ever recover, then it was a good choice.
Given BTC's past though, the chance for it to not recover is pretty slim. If (when) it does, the people who sold will feel mighty silly
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:19:15
Keep a watch on the price and buy more if it sinks lower

@_date: 2013-12-06 19:39:23
You're correct, we don't know (hence me saying there is a (albeit slim) chance of non-recovery), but looking at past trends, other (more positive) attention BTC is getting, etc. it is very reasonable to assume that this is not an all-out crash and that the price will rise again.
People who panic-sold at a profit will still feel silly if the price rises back up again and they realize they lost potential hundreds/thousands :). Provided they didn't buy back in during a dip of course 
Just remember, panic-selling almost NEVER ends in the seller's favor in the end. Unless you can accurately predict the future
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:26:42
It would need to have an escrow and since BTC is still so volatile you would have to be able to pin prices in BTC based on the USD (or whatever other fiat currency). 
There are some markets out there that use BTC, but there is definitely room for improvement all around. If you think you're up to it then go for it!
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:08:53
There may have been legal goods on the Silk Road, but it was still illegal to buy them there. By doing so you would be directly contributing to the operation of a criminal organization (since SR was taking a commission from ALL sales, not just illegal ones). Not to mention the fact that by buying on SR you are circumventing taxes (which for things like cigarettes can be quite serious). This makes it illegal still, so the Feds are in their "rights" to seize all of SR's assets.
Edit: Downvotes for providing correct information. Nice.

I'm speaking more about smaller-time investors than people who are Traders by profession. You shouldn't play the woulda-coulda-shoulda game, but that doesn't stop it from invading these peoples' minds (and making them potentially feel silly, which is all I was saying)
