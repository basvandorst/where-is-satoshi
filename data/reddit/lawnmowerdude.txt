Typical troll action this is: If you open this site on an android device you get redirected to some virus stuff .....
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:02:05
Thanks man, that is is a solid writeup of what I'm thinking about.
So it's called Hyperbitcoinization already!
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:03:29
So are you saying the price of a bitcoin is about 4 times less than indicated?
@_date: 2015-12-13 18:58:38
More interesting; Why Satoshi ... ?
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:48:05
Somewhere the chain reaction is going to start leading to the next credit crunch...
@_date: 2015-12-23 18:46:30
This is ridiculous and shows how far of you guys have gone...  
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:07:37
This is ECB folks. These guys are really on the edge of financial excellence through economic wisdom! /s
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:59:45
It's the Node Index that is to improve :-)
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:57:20
True, they have no clue but category 2 has the additional property of public failure!
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:35:08
So next question is: How many stocks are traded at Nasdaq?
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:17:46
You're on to him man, i think you're really close!
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:52:48
You Americans are made war upon by your own government and you still don't get it? 
I'm telling you, this Bitcoin thing is going to be huge one day.
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:04:16
No worries. We won't see that anymore in a couple of years. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:57:30
Them poor Greek, in the endgame these Syriza guys are gonna throw them in a lot of trouble!
@_date: 2015-05-11 21:40:47
So, Bitcoin will go to 500,= soon ?
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:12:51
That's what I always say when we talk about the development of Bitcoin and the risk of continuity for that matter; Bitcoin development is like Linux development. Linux rocks and so will Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-05-01 10:48:33
It must be said. You are one positive monument man!
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:14:18
Alright man, that's how you do it. Next you may want to register at bitnodes.io and get a measurement for your Peer Index (PIX).  My PIX at the moment is 9.1159   :) 
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:45:07
So the halving of the block reward will have an earlier ETA?
This is actually good news :-)
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:09:16
You may have a point there
@_date: 2016-03-17 07:34:09
So... what do you think of a confirmed transfer time of around 20 times faster than bitcoin has?
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:42:59
Looks like his new friend(s) made him do this: 
Nothing new here, just another bankster. 
Expect them.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:38:18
They are going to have a wonderful working relation together, these new friends!
@_date: 2015-05-10 17:19:08
More like; Bitcoin will be the default payment option.
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:58:01
Same here, i know you now feel like a not-so-very-old dude ;) 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:39:43
He is right. The amount of debt they hold is not sustainable in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-05-10 17:11:45
This Krugman guy is a phenomenon of the Revolution. It is a chaotic process which has an outcome that is incomprehensible for guys like him. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:38:15
So that's actually good news. There's only 15M bitcoins ...
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:56:06
Not gonna happen; simply too profitable for these guys to keep status quo.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:39:56
There is a way to vote for bigger blocks by running a BitcoinXT or Bitcoin Unlimited node ....
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:42:11
That's about the dumbest strategy I have heard of in a long time.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:51:14
But were you drunk?
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:27:28
Which makes this Simon guy look pretty ridiculous: 
"Named by City AM as one of the Top 10 most influential people in Fintech, Simon’s work at Barclays focuses on understanding the impact of this new technology on Barclays 
businesses and clients"
 
@_date: 2015-07-04 12:03:43
Very sad. The poor man is fucked classic bankers style; the weak and defenceless paying the bill ...
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:05:08
Permissioned blokchain? 
I must have missed something there but I don't understand this concept. Is this what they mean by blockchain without bitcoin? Which makes unpermissioned the Blockchain including Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:38:06
This clown. Next thing will be to ban all music he doesn't like....
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:22:42
They changed their mind and realized they have to keep the coins because, well you know...
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:01:38
So you are saying I can't send my friend a few bucks to help him out?
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:40:19
The problem is they shouldn't be in the Euro at first because of their trouble having a sustainable household. Do you know how they are faked into the Euro and who was the primary assistant?
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:38:07
you see ....
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:43:16
yeah, and mine is still within top 25 :-)
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:26:06
Now what a coincidence this is! At the same time bankers are trying to shove negative interest rates down your throats!
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:30:24
China has lift off!
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:44:50
Any other evidence then just the smell of it? 
Seems to me there are lots of buthurt screamers out there who haven't got a clue why their but hurts so much ....
Evidence or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:40:43
I think you should think again and follow the facts back in time!
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:52:54
yeah, probably
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:52:30
RESPECT, for turning them down!
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:59:16
I know man. Thing is it is maybe even a better illustration of the impact of Bitcoin on transaction costs in the online economy.
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:18:35
Here you have a perfect demonstration of the endpoint of a fractional reserve: it is doomed in the end because it leaves too much slack for moral hazard. Thiefs and bankers are unnoticed until it is too late!  
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:18:58
Maybe it is a true positive! 
Did you check the MD5 hash?
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:06:34
Is that Blythe in her younger years?
@_date: 2015-10-20 18:19:14
sounds legit
@_date: 2015-11-14 09:54:08
No, it's 'Hope to you there'. This is gentlemen.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:43:46
That is 42, not 17 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:12:32
I ran the node behind a 4GB connection .... service for all other hosts got disrupted, had to squeeze available bandwith temporarily. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:04:49
I'm pretty sure you couldn't have seen the attack on my node from your monitoring setup. Also complaining about it doesn't identify the node itself, so how could I have identified myself? 
The amount of traffic directed towards my node was enormous, not scriptkiddies work. This node was in the top 10 of the network at a certain time. That made it a target by definition in the Bitcoin space. I quit because I realized that such kind of professional vandalism will obfuscate a whole community!
I don't think it is such a small issue as you mentioned... Let's see what will happen 
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:57:57
Yeah, it didn't work those times maybe because of the enormous DDOS attack. 
I get this feeling it will happen again this time ...
