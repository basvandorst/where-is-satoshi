"I grew up in Argentina, my parents were sheep ranchers, and I saw them lose everything at least three times. Once because of inflation, once because of deflation and once because their savings were confiscated. I recognize that those are extremes but, when you grow up in that environment you become much more aware of problems with currency. So when I saw bitcoin it was like a dream."

@_date: 2014-01-13 08:25:00
Yep, the big problem with coinbase is that they don't have different access levels. If someone gets your API key, they can do whatever they want.
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:03:25
well, my point is that if you trade with btc, doing it locally or internationally is the same thing regarding fees. No extra cost.

Someone already created a pull request adding a .gitignore!
@_date: 2014-01-19 05:07:21
I don't get your point.
 * Merchants can keep the btc using coinbase and I think it should be possible with bitpay as well.
 * The sushi place used bitpay, but they could use their another thing and keep the btc. That's totally up to them.
On the other hand, this has nothing to do with the merchant. It's just to get back the btc you spent.

UPDATE (25th April 02:30 BST): Xapo CEO Wences Casares spoke to CoinDesk to clarify the situation, stating that the company is currently working with an undisclosed bank to launch the open-loop debit card product, but it has yet to select a credit card network with which to power the offering. However, it was originally planning to use the MasterCard network.

I think $1 off is less than the money you save on credit card fees. I hope you can do better than that.
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:13:14
well, if you keep the btc, there is no fee. if you cash it to usd, 1% fee after the first 1m dollar. At least that's how it works with coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:57:17
Can someone explain what this means?

@_date: 2014-03-17 21:17:42
mmm... more or less. The app is done from the customer point of view.
Let me give you an example. Imagine your customers are a party of two. If they are using this app, one of them pays for 100% of the bill and the app will be used to ask for the 50% to the other person. 
It would be nice to do it from the merchant perspective, but it's something I didn't thought of when I did this :(
 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:11:52
Yes. The user sending the request needs to have a coinbase account. The bitcoins will be sent there.

I have been using my chase account to buy btc in Coinbase without an issue. What could have trigger this situation?
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:42:31
Nice comment. Let me reply your questions.
* What exactly is the exchange rate at which I am selling/trading my BTC, and what is the exchange rate offered to me for a buy-back "BAS: Buy as Spent"? *
Not something I care for a lunch bill. Using the price at the moment of writing:






Fee for buying: 


Lost money in fees:


That's around 2.33% of the original price, which is much less than the credit card fees the merchant pays.
* Who is the merchant using and who am I using for the immediate BAS? If Coinbase is the answer in both cases, am I morally fine with them taking &gt;2% cut for their claimed but failed services? *
Removing the 1% will not be possible all the time. It's only possible if Coinbase is in both sides, which in my example it wasn't. Also notice that the bank fee will always exists.
I am not concern of paying the 1% + $0.15 to Coinbase because right now is the best way I have to buy BTC.
I like the idea of "If the merchant is also Coinbase, no 1% fee to BAS". It's a nice marketing campaign for them.
*Why would I buy something using BTC only to re-buy back the same amount and overpay &gt;1%?*
There are two separate questions here.
* 1) Why do you want to pay with btc? *
This is answered all the time in reddit, but my personal answer is:
 - Merchants "should" offer discounts for btc payments. They are not paying credit card fees so it would be fair if we share that benefit.
 - When traveling I would prefer avoiding exchange fees
 - I feel more secure scanning a qr than giving my credit card
 - I want to promote btc
* 2) Why do you want to buy back? *
 - I want to use btc because of it's benefit and I prefer spending fiat
 - I implemented BAS because I was lazy to re-buy after doing a purchase. Sometimes I did it hour later and the price volatility made me lose more money
 - ** Using BAS will maintain the price or even increase it **
Examples for "Using BAS will maintain the price or even increase it":
 - If the merchant sells the btc to usd, the price is maintained
 - If the merchant keep a % of the btc, the price will go up
