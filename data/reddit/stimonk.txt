Very true - but I think the  reason not to disclose their identity would be to avoid the intense pressure from governments to shut it down or build a loophole (think:NSA) to track who owns which wallet.
The more curious thing here is that it could be a group of people, rather than just one person. It could be a large group of people under a single pseudonym

Well I was a conference and one of the largest development groups for ecommerce platforms stated that integration of bitcoin was a necessity for retailers -especially those operating online. Can't remember the company, but they're responsible for setting up many of the fortune 500 brand's ecommerce solutions. 
I'm still a newbie to cryptocurrency - but I suspect all it takes is one major bank to start holding bitcoin before everyone follows suit.

Damn, they're not giving the $10 anymore.

This is the part of bitcoin people need to see - it's the true power of what this currency can offer. The transaction fee is how most payment gateways/banks make most of their money, and it's truly one of the ways consumers get screwed over.
The fact that Bitcoin has a low &amp; flat transaction fee regardless of what's exchanged would be a very compelling reason to use it. No bank or financial organization can compete (or would want to compete) - it's their bread &amp; butter.

Neat service - if I can offer a tip - create a mini tutorial on how to use the site, as the homepage is a bit confusing and could be optimized to direct users into taking their first lesson. 
Thanks :)

That's not true - you can usually move around up to $9k without contacting in advance. Once you hit that threshold you raise a lot of flags, unless you're using it locally within the bank - like moving it to a bond or some form of investment.

Interesting, probably very cost-effective compared to the alternative of accepting credit cards where you have to pay the CC companies the transaction fee for each item, whereas if they use bitcoin they could save tons in transaction fees.

They're going to reward users for tuning into the game and commenting. 
It's positive reinforcement - comment on the game and give some insight they can share on live TV, and they'll give you some bitcoin - it revolutionizes engagement with your viewers in real-time.
Sports is one of the only content that viewers still want to watch live, and that means watching it on TV (and to a lesser degree streaming online). People still pay for cable to keep their sport channels, so they need to keep people tuned in and engaged, and this is one way to  do - it's a very strategic decision and a smart one at that!

Securities/stocks is built on speculation, and Warren Buffet's strategy is based on minimizing risk by selecting stocks with a long history - which means he seldom invests in new technology. Note that this approach is used to protect existing profits/investments, it won't make you super rich - only better protect your current holdings/investments.
It's a very conservative approach, but fortunes are not always built on betting on the sure thing.

India has a population of 1+ billion people with growing access to smartphones. People in rural areas don't always have access to a bank and are vulnerable to theft. 
Bitcoin could easily take off as a means to transfer funds with low transaction fees, and since a lot of e-payment gateways don't really accept or do business with India (e.g. Paypal has very strict rules about Indian accounts), bitcoin could become an easy way for them to transact online - and I don't think it would be very difficult to get many retailers there to accept it as a payment.
It just takes one wealthy bitcoiner to start a campaign and start the infrastructure.

I have the equivalent of $0.23 worth of bitcoin, I probably don't belong here.

But the guy was holding it at the time, I would imagine they'd have to say something like "You're under arrest [..] we have a warrant for the laptop you're holding" - otherwise wouldn't that count as unreasonable searches and seizure

How did they know it would encrypt when closed - I guess they were wiretapping, but I find the whole thing bizarre. If they grabbed it from his hands, isn't that theft? I get they might have a warrant, but it seems weird that they wouldn't have to disclose that before taking it away from him.

I guess that doesn't hurt..

Great idea - but I was really hoping he would ask her how many of her passengers actually use bitcoin vs. opting for other methods.
