If you flip a coin 10 times you might even get 10 heads or tails on every flip. That's not a pattern. You have to flip it thousands of times in order to get a statistic and a pattern. That is if there is one at all.

All I am saying is that you should care more about how much crypto you hold. That is if you care about crypto. If you care about making more USD then the price does matter.
Personally I trust the technology and I am trying to collect as much crypto as I can. So if the price in use falls I see it as an opportunity to buy more crypto.

Blockchain is a p2p database with consensus rules. You can use it for a trillion things other than cryptocurrencies. Most of the cryptocurrencies use a Blockchcain, some use a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or a combination of both.

It is possible considering that once cryptos are strong enough. Fiat currencies are going to lose value. Therefore $1 today doesn't not equal $1 tomorrow. On top of that add fiat Inflation. 
Plus cryptos are not just currencies. They are store of value, value transmission network, shares, dapps. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:44:59
No. War comes from inflation. As long as the government can print as much as they want and make you believe that it's worth something they have unlimited funds for war. Hacking wallets is something else. Keep your private keys offline and you have nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 00:54:39
Exactly, now you want to be able to trade that with goods and services. You shouldn't care about trading it with USD. The FED can print as much fiat USD as they want. USD is not scarce, while Bitcoin is, just like gold.

Wait. A blockchain/protocol like Bitcoin, Litecoin etc. practically don't have a leader. I agree with you that they may affect people's opinions but that's because people will always seek for leaders to guide them. That's their fault not litecoin's or decred's fault. Technologically speaking Bitcoin and Litecoin don't have major differences. Anyway these projects are not companies whatsoever. There are a lot of projects that ARE companies though, I am just saying that not all altcoins are companies. 
Just because there is gold doesn't mean we can't use silver or bronze. I would say that we need to use Litecoin for example alongside Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot scale globally. Also there are problems out there that Bitcoin hasn't solved that need to get solved.
- Fair and equal distribution.
- Centralized miners (ASIC, GPU farms).
- Centralized exchanges (which IMO are the biggest threat since they collect a lot of cryptos especially Bitcoin, thus centralizing it).
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:36:26
My TA (Elliott Waves) confirms that. Might even surpass 10K. 10-12K probably.

Fuck ETF's and fuck the SEC. Remember what Bitcoin is all about? So we don't have to deal with those fuckers.
P. S. Also fuck the Wall Street. I'd rather have Bitcoin adoption between the people and not the whales. Do you want them to buy a lot of Bitcoin? I don't. I want the people to buy Bitcoin and devalue the value of fiat.
I don't even count my crypto in fiat anymore. I count them in crypto.
Don't forget that they can print as many USD and other fiat currencies as they please and buy your crypto from thin air. Don't sell for fiat. You are doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:17:40

You can also game on macOS and Linux. Otherwise on Windows you could use Malwarebytes Anti-malware and BitDefender Antivirus. Both score high on malware detection (rootkits, adware, viruses etc).
Also keep the OS and applications/games up-to-date, be careful what and from where you are downloading stuff.
On top of those I would add Unchecky and Antirun (Google them).

It doesn't expose your private key. Meaning it's stored on the hardware wallet with NO posibility of expose online or on your machine. Even if the machine you are using is infected. My suggestion would be Trezor. But really any hardware wallet is MUCH better than keeping your money on an exchange. Why would you trust an exchange for God's sake ?????
Donyournown research please. There is plenty of information online.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:16:10
Have you ever sold higher or bought lower than the current price? In other words did you ever lose money on purpose mate?
@_date: 2018-07-17 05:06:48
It's not accurate at all. The correlation between them is high. Not 100%, but high. In any case, both are extremely volatile in price with no guarantee of hedging, therefore no guarantee of minimizing loss. If we were talking about futures then I would say that would be a nice hedge.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:04:48
Do you even know how trading works mate? The price goes up or down because someone (dynamic traders) are selling higher or lower from the current price. That's the ONLY way a price moves. Selling and buying as a passive trader ( at the current price) doesn't move the price.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:53:46
