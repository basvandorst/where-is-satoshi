It's original design and purpose was to undermine a corrupt banking industry.
Of course that's going to attract all the tin foil hat wearers...

I've never like this part about Bitcoin. $0.06 is a lot in some countries. And what prevents all miners from agreeing to stop accepting transactions that pay less than $0.50 fee's, or even $5.00 fees?

My question is how they will make money on this. Financial institutions don't do things for free.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:21:53
So one day we can expect to pay as much or more remittance to miners instead of a bank? Why is that better than using a bank?

I don't think his employment or social normality has anything to do with his opinion of the video...  Unless your being facetious. In that case, LOL!
I think it's annoying because she is attempting to use a pop culture reference in an awkward way while also belittling people that are ignorant to Bitcoin. This has two effects: 
1. Anyone that she offends will become more entrenched in their beliefs and less likely to research the topic. 
2. Tarnishes the image of people that own Bitcoin.
I'm not sure what her goal was but it didn't help Bitcoin, her, or the people that use it. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:42:33
If you're into Bitcoin because you hope the price will go up, you're doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:29:19
Maybe I'm missing something, but can't bitcoin's public ledger be mined? Couldn't we figure out who owns most addresses with some clever mining algorithms?

The funny thing about history... It can repeat itself, but it doesn't have to.

"Disable Wifi"
Software can't turn that back on and connect to a network without him knowing? The physical switch on the side of a laptop is software controlled. A driver can override it. 
Call me paranoid, but I'd rather have that WiFi card physically removed from the laptop.

He was right. I'm having trouble attributing this rally to anything concrete. It's making me nervous.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:32:52
I just saw that too. He used to run an exchange. Why would he do this to the market? Sell the coin slowly so you don't cause panic.
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:59:27
If you were a whale that big, it would absolutely cause a bubble. The stock price would overshoot it's real worth and you would buy over... WAY over at the end of your purchase. 
If you traded for the house fast enough, you might not see the crash when the bubble collapses.
@_date: 2014-05-01 08:12:53
If you keep buying Bitcoin, the supply will decrease and demand increase. With enough money, you would create a shortage that could incite panic. You would likely create your own bubble. 
I'm only speculating here, but I think Bitcoin would become unusable at 100 satoshi's per US dollar or $1,000,000/BTC. You would basically run out of decimal points.
If the total market cap ever hit $21 quadrillion we would be in some serious trouble. We could run into trouble before that happened, but usability was the first thing I thought of.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:39:40
Oops. I was clearly not the first.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:43:37
I hope he drops the price a little more. I need some more opportunity to buy in!

It's not an investment. If you try to use it like an investment, you're going to get burned.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:21:07
It's not a get rich quick scheme. This is not a stock. The real real impact will be how Bitcoin changes the way we all exchange money.
If you want to try your hand at "playing the market" go right ahead. Maybe you'll make boat loads and prove me wrong. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:09:20
I believe it could be Mark's BTC. The seller is behaving in a way that doesn't destroy the market.
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:58:34
No, some of us bought at $1000 and tried to get rich quick, and some of us are using it for what it was designed for. 
If the price should do anything, it should not change at all.

At the expense of her public image? Whatever floats your boat I guess...

I gotta start selling on local Bitcoins then....

"Storing BTC in ANY web based system is asking for them to get stolen, frozen or otherwise lost"
This is the most important quote I've read on this forum. Stop trusting companies with your money. They do not hurt like you do when your whole savings goes missing/inaccessible. It doesn't matter if we're talking fiat or coin. 
Do it the hard way and make manual offline cold savings wallets. When you withdrawal, scrap the old wallet and transfer remaining to a new wallet. It's hard work, but your money is always in your control and safe.
With security you are constantly trading convenience for safety.

But shouldn't the has rate follow the price?
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:10:40
You got it backwards. It would make sense that miners would buy more equipment if the price went up.

Yes I do. And so does the majority of the world. It takes them an entire day to make that much. 
Can you even fathom how much your Bitcoin will be worth when the majority of China and India are using it daily? It HAS to be compatible with small transactions.

Bitcoin is permissionless. It does not need permission from any state to exist. 
If you can tell me how a state would even hope to ban something like Bitcoin, I'm all ears. My opinion is that a "ban" would be words with no teeth.

So Bitcoin only works for the rich now?

So you don't think demand will go down, but you don't think it'll go up either?
@_date: 2019-10-05 00:58:02
Btc isn't based on nothing. The value is based in scarcity, which is the same as gold. It's the same thing that gave every currency value up until we left the gold standard. People can depend on that scarcity which is why it's worth so much. When you buy a Bitcoin you know it isn't possible for someone or some organization to just devalue it.
The value of fiat is actually pinned to nothing. There is nothing scarce about it and there is one private company hitting the print button whenever they feel like it.
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:08:55

But Americans affect the usage so little. It's other countries that are driving demand. You can see it in the price fluctuations. Good or bad American news does nothing to the price, but all China has to do is sneeze the wrong way and the price goes nuts.

Wow. Here's another one. Redditor for 1 month. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:49:59
If you look at it like a stock, you'll probably lose a lot. The mentality that "I want to buy this now so I can trade it for fiat later" is a dumb idea IMO.
I'm stock piling because I think I'll be able to use Bitcoin on all the cool apps and systems that are being invented right now. I'm excited for what they're building, and I'll need as much as I can get to able to use those things. If you think about it like that instead of like the stock market or that your gambling, you won't screw yourself if the price plummets.
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:14:47

Gotta love the internet. Endless critics, but not one person lifts a finger.
@_date: 2015-08-28 16:56:13
I'm not saying its meaningless in mathematics. As a marketing strategy, I feel nothing when I hear "strength in numbers". It doesn't get me excited, and to be frank, "strength in numbers" sounds like the reasoning behind a ponzi. 
My thoughts are "Bitcoin: Strength in Numbers" because there are a lot of people using it? Because they need a lot of people using it? 
Currency is a tool. Much like a screwdriver, I don't care how many Craftsman vs Huskey screwdrivers there are, I only care if it works and it's easy. Tag lines should sell something based on how it makes the users life better.
Great topics for the tag line would be something about it's low remittance or its network uptime. Hell, I can't count how many times my bank has been inaccessible to me, but Bitcoin's network has a 99.989% uptime.
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:16:03
This is another great one. I'm a fan.
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:13:08
Until I see someone get off their butt and design a better one, I'm in agreement that this is the best design so far. 
Visually this is significantly more official looking. It's simple and doesn't overload me with info. It's also visually attractive. And while it doesn't beg me to dig into the site, it does peak my interest. 
Seriously, great design work If you are a volunteer, thanks for the work. It's nice to see people devote their talents.
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:55:12
It makes sense though. I'm not a huge fan of "strength in numbers". Feels meaningless. It's like "Go team".

The fact that this was hushed means it has got to be recreated. Someone doesn't want it to exist, so it has to.
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:27:11
Bitcoin is not replacing cash. Personally, I don't think a superior product over cash has been created yet but it won't be long. When you have the coordination of some of the smartest people on the planet working on something it's only a matter of time.
The thought that paper money can never be improved on is delusional.

Not sure what you mean by this. I was saying that if you had an analog phone connected to a POTS line, that somewhere on the internet it would be converted to TCP/IP packets likely using VOIP protocols like SIP. SIP wouldn't let a phone call stay open if one side hung up. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:52:40
Almost all calls, even international ones are now VOIP. Even if you have plain old copper lines running to your house, the call is going to get converted to VOIP at some point along the way to India. 
There is an internet protocol for handling a VOIP call called SIP. Kind of like http for phone calls. This is how it works:
