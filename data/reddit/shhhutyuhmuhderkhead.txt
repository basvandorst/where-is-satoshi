Have you got a link to the video where he does that? I tried searching but couldn't find anything. 
The thing is you're not only ok with it but see it as a positive thing. Corporations losing that power is a step backwards, no?
I'm somewhat ok with it as I believe private companies should have the ability to choose who they do business with. The bigger issue is the lack of competition in these industries and the disproportionate power it gives them. I think they need to be more responsible with how they weild it.

This is one of the reasons bitcoin was created.

So like WikiLeaks who PayPal did it to previously (with government pressure).
Yeah Alex Jones is obviously a nutjob, but it's all subjective. I'd rather the merits of a person be judged by the population as a whole and not a handful of corporations. Also, did he actually call for his viewers to harass families or did he just claim that they were crisis actors? I support their right to make that choice but definitely don't consider it a positive development for democracy. 
The only plus is that it'll speed the move towards decentralised, private, censor proof protocols. Do you not feel hypocritical supporting bitcoin when it'll make censorship such as this (which you consider a positive thing) completely impotent?

Bitcoin's for buying things on darknet markets, assisting people who've been cut-off from the financial system, funding political revolutions, evading capital controls.
It's not for some fat tub of lard to get rich off before cashing out to US dollars because he's happy with the crony capitalism of today's society.

Trump's inner circle aren't the only people with political power in the United States. 
Thiel is no longer part of PayPal, and just because he supports Trump doesn't mean he loves Alex Jones.

How can we be sure government isn't placing pressure on these companies? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:07:11
How is it a ridiculous idea? 
Regardless, do you not think it's better to take a strict stance against censorship by oligopolistic industries in the meantime, while we work on building the infrastructure to make it impossible in the future? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:15:04
You never heard of the shadow government? 
It's unusual that a bunch of supposedly independent entities all decided to take action against him around the same time. Reminds me of the time social networks banned crypto ads.
Bitcoin supports AJ, it was designed to prevent this from happening. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:18:43
Are you that limited to not accept that it's a possibility?  And that it hasn't happened on multiple occasions in the past?
It supports censorship resistance and through that people like Alex Jones. It'll support you too if you ever need it.

I think he's fairly well-intentioned unlike Zuck but probably receives a lot of bad advice and is also prone to his own fuck ups. 
It's a shame Twitter doesn't have a messaging app as internationally popular as Whatsapp, that's the reason facebucks are likely to succeed.

I don't think there's any context where you shouldn't be allowed to film during a riot. 
Police are made up of the same individuals everywhere. Standards are generally looser in the US but given the opportunity it doesn't take much for the French or Spanish police to show their true colours.

Fair enough, I still think that in a 5 years time once more competition enters the market we'll look back on current hardware wallet prices as insane. 


Their last firmware update was in April and was non-essential. I'm sure they have plenty of software developers but they're not working on the Nano S.


I already own a Nano S which I bought last year for 20% cheaper than the current price. I like the product I just think like most crypto-currency security products it's way overpriced. Other examples include $99 for a piece of metal ([Cryptosteel]( 
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:23:49
Even with the discount it's still more expensive then it was at the start of the year. 
Some competition is desperately needed, the profit margins are absurd.

Lol so necessary....

I don't know for sure but the fact that hardware wallets are an effective duopoly and the demand for secure storage of insane amounts of wealth is probably highly inelastic, I think it's a fair assumption. 
The hardware I imagine is very cheap and the software on the ledger itself whilst needing to be extremely secure isn't particularly complex and once it's done, it's done.
I'm sure they spend a decent amount developing official wallets for the hundreds of different cryptos but I'd rather they didn't. There's a bunch of free, open source user interfaces which are fully compatible with the Ledger Nano and offer a far superior user experience ie. [MEW]( [MyCrypto](
I get that production and boxing of these devices is more expensive than mainstream electronics and I'm glad they're not being built in some unknown Chinese factory.

Ethereum the protocol hasn't been hacked once. If you're gonna criticize at least figure out how it works.

This isn't EOS, ETH transaction cost money and nobody's bankrupting themselves to promote their shitty gambling app for longer than a couple of days.

It has more daily transactions than bitcoin so yeah

Mainly decentralised exchanges which I honestly find superior to their centralised counterparts.
Instadapp and through it Maker/Compound.
Once Augur enables Dai based trading I'll be 100% jumping on that. Currently don't due to volatile ETH price.
I tip the websites I visit through Brave (not sure this counts as I don't really pay it much attention to it, and the tipping system is pretty centralised, I just like the browser particularly on mobile)
God's Unchained I'm not into but I see the potential in that type of thing.
Not really participated in any DAOs as of yet but expect that to take off (much like Defi) within the next few years.
Provably fair gambling dapps will become a big thing in the future, however I'm only really interested in poker.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:39:58
Because bitcoin's never struggled with slow block times and high transaction fees? That's the price of decentralisation with current technology.
By all means attack ETH as an investment, the current market has me doubting too. But don't tell me it's not being used when it clearly is.

Right wing news and social media has spent years attacking Assange you plank. 
I don't think anyone should be persecuted for publishing leaked information that is of public interest. I don't give a fuck whether they are politically biased or not. 
I support Wikileaks the same as I support whoever leaked the Panama Papers and I find Clinton blaming Russia for the DNC leaks as laughable as when Putin blamed the US for the Panama Papers.

@_date: 2019-04-11 15:22:24
Article from the daily mail about "gloating Assange". Look at the comments for examples of how right wing media consumers viewed Assange at the time.
I'll admit things have done a 180° since then and many right wing people are supportive. But still this is mainly restricted to Libertarian and Alt-right style right wingers. Traditional conservatives, neo-cons and Zionists detest him.

It's backed by nothing. Read the Wikipedia article for the Petro and tell me it's not a shitcoin.  The Venezuelan government can barely produce a functioning website let alone an economically sound cryptocurrency. If you're that confident in the Petro why don't you invest?

Authoritarianism and placing the "state" above the individuals that comprise it.

If you can't see how NSA spying and national states of emergency evoke fascism then you're a fucking idiot. 
Funny you should bring up newspeak. Given that one of the things Orwell took from his experience in Catalonia was how rapidly lefties could devolve into totalitarianism.
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:08:44
It's the Venezuelan government that claims it's backed by something, in the white paper 1 petro = 1 oil barrel. I know Maduro is a fat lying sack of shit. 
The government can't alter the supply of Bitcoin nor can it censor transactions. 
 If you're that confident in the Petro why don't you invest and wait a couple of years?

You're right apart from people aren't flooding into Europe because they support European values. They're coming because European values (and a dash of neo-imperialism) have produced safe streets and strong economies. 
It'd be like Ripple lovers infiltrating Bitcoin because of it's brand recognition and booming price then calling for the end of POW. In this case it wouldn't be a massive deal as you can simply hardfork, what do you do when your culture is supplanted in the physical world? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:32:45
The fascists are already in, immigration and the problems it brings provide the excuse for a bigger and more authoritarian government and make for a convenient scapegoat when the economy goes south. 
Full right wing reactionism isn't the solution but it's where we're heading, If we want to curtail it we need to see some common sense immigration policies. About 40% of the immigrants I come into contact with on a day to day basis have objectively made the country a worse place to live. These aren't charming Ted Bundy style sociopaths but blatant spot them from a mile off scumbags.
You can hardfork a currency but not a piece of land and there's a certain level of population influx we're approaching which can change the culture of a country irreparably. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:16:21
I don't see many Venezuelans complaining
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:41:25


You can support all this while still viewing a loose immigration policy as a threat that will only lead to a strengthened and less democratic nation state.

Turkey is the only one I consider truly totalitarian if that can be classed as Europe. I'd consider Switzerland to be the freest. They all apply authoritarian policies to various extents.
Former communist countries are very blatant about it and are leaning towards the totalitarian end of the scale, I forgive this somewhat given their histories and economies.
The EU is becoming increasingly involved in national politics and Greece for example is ruled from Brussels as much as they are from Athens. The Euro was the worst thing to ever happen to southern Europe and barring a spectacular turn around I can't see indebted Eurozone countries ever recovering their sovereignty while being part of the Euro.
Within the historically freer Western and Central European nations there's been a steady increase in authoritarian policies. The UK is especially hilarious with it's anti nazi pug and facesitting laws.
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:52:16
That's strange because you sound like exactly the kind of sandal wearing leftist he'd criticise.
I'm using the word fascism because despite what some people claim I don't consider Tony Blair or Emmanuel Macron to be particularly left wing. They're centrists with totalitarian urges. They then wave around a refugees welcome sign to win a few sandal wearing voters. Maybe I'm throwing the fascist word around a little bit too liberally but then I hear people calling Salvini a fascist so maybe not. Salvini's the type of guy I'd go for a pint with, Blair's a war criminal.


What gave you the impression I can't see that? We disagree in that I think the mass immigration that has come into Europe since 1945 is a symptom of that US occupation. Mass immigration increases the nation state's GDP while fucking over the common man.
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:09:12
If the EU wants to survive then that's true. 
It would involve national leaders acting against the immediate interests of their people, if they want to maintain the pretense of democracy they need to convince voters that keeping Italians happy outweighs the negative of taking in thousands and thousands of migrants. 
In the years that it takes to reach an agreement Italy get's fucked more and more. To me Salvini has done the right thing in stopping the boats coming in. Adds a sense of urgency to other EU leaders.

I'm unarmed and harmless, I don't think he was that bad a dude.


And you don't think they share any similarities? There's no point arguing over the definition of words, whatever it is it's authoritarian and shit and I don't like it. 


Most mass immigration hasn't been from warring states. Also the recent wave spilling into Italy from Libya is due to a war that was as much France's fault as it was the US. Of course Italians are the fascists for wanting migrant boats to dock in France rather than Italy.
