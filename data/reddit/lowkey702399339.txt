Fair enough, if you use a credit card that way. I am afraid many do not. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:21:48
Nothing negative about it. Credit card purchase of crypto should be discouraged as it can only bring instability to the system. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:28:42
Exactly. And it will attract heavy regulations at the time when crypto are not ready yet. So, Visa and Mastercard are doing good to the ecosystem by introducing the additional fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:52:56
It won’t, but it can cause default in a large number if there is a prolonged stagnation or downturn in values. This would be used by banks and governments to outlaw exchanges and even cryptos. Not good when the ecosystem is not ready to function outside of fiat.

For me, bitcoin is what I think it is not what .gov says it is.

BTC have to live to the high expectations set over the last 6 months. In the absence of "great" news any news is not good enough - hence a low confidence and the price to match.
Having said that, the gloom expectations are set in and any moderately good news will lift the spirit to the new highs.

Incorrect. If more people stretch their finances to buy crypto they would be weak hands during the downturn.

16 mil Bitcoin x $15k = $240 bill. 
$240 bill = 34%
$240 bill/ 34 * 100= $705 bill 
$705bill - $240 bill = $465 bill
$465 bill = 1000s shitcoins 
$240 bill = bitcoin

There was only one 35 year cycle since 1974 and the beginning of the free printing frenzy and none since 2008 and the really really frenzy printing. 
The Dow is fed by the huge amount of imaginary money and yes some of that imaginary money is being flown into cryptocurrencies too.
The money injected in crypto is far less than $500bill. This is a silly metric to differentiate stock market assets/commodities but has nothing to do with Crypto.
In the case of crypto, it just means that the last person who bought a coin paid $X and that that X multiplied by a number of coins in circulation. It doesn't mean by any stretch of the imagination that this amount of funds are invested.
Nevertheless, this is I see as a positive sign showing the potential for growth on a much larger scale than it is anticipated.

That works for the stock market in order to differentiate between the shares values of different companies. This is traditionally used way to value companies to the overall market. 
It may work if one wants to distinguish between different cryptocurrencies but not cross markets and crypto asset classes. 
It doesn't have any sense comparing Apple, for example, which is a tech company that make and sell hardware and software to the customers, creating profit or loss and where value of each share is linked to the profit, with a virtual value of a cryptocurrency.  
Yes, both would be as worth as someone is prepared to pay, but each share of Apple would be linked to the overall declared profit, where each value of a crypto coin is only linked to the previous one sold.
It is a new class asset and there is no proper valuation tool for it yet.

IF you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: 
If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,

Without high fees there would be no Cryptocurrencies, full stop.
Here is why,
High fees come from the miners who prioritise transaction according to their fees as blocks being congested, due to the 1MB block size (which is artificially imposed maximum to maintain decentralisation of the blockchain).
This is one of the main attributes of Bitcoin. If ever the decentralisation is undermined you would not have Bitcoin and whole ecosystem would disappear as a consequence of that.
Decentralisation ensures the censorship resistance, definitely most important attribute of Bitcoin.
The censorship resistance ensures, in turn, the immutability which is also most important attribute.
Guess what, this keeps Bitcoin scarcity intact which in f. turn gives this excellent value to Bitcoin.
Conclusion, if you had no high fees there would be no value in Bitcoin and you wouldn't give shit in sending or receiving it.

There are few relevant issues with January 2018
Coinbase will release Bcash to pre 1st August owners, so I would expect a huge pump up by Roger &amp; Jihan to convince these owners not to sell Bcash.
The futures will expire in the mid and the end of January, which will slightly move the price up or down.
The holiday gatherings will increase the size of network exponentially with a considerable push-up.
My estimate $25k, and probably $30k by February.

If you had bitcoin prior August fork you'd have an equal amount in Bcash, so you wouldn't worry too much about it.
Any prudent bitcoin(er) would HODL both of the coins, just in case. Drawing conclusion out of it,  one should buy Bcash every time he buys bitcoin, to hedge one against the other. 
Bcash is being pumped now and will be pumped for some time. It is very artificial and a couple people dependent. In short, if anything happens to Jihan and/or Roger Bcash would be rendered useless. 
Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't depend on anyone but the community and collective HODL.

Somehow it works out by doubling of the previous critical mass, which was $17 -19k.
So my conservative assessment $34k will be lower critical mass next time, drop to the 30-40% and then grow to the next critical mass.

It isn't too late for investors to hop into cryptocurrencies after the bitcoin futures launch on the Cboe, an analyst told CNBC on Monday.
"Relative to assets, you're talking $100 trillion in investable assets," said Brian Kelly, founder of BK Capital Management. "All you would need is 1 percent of those assets to be allocated to this and you've got a double in bitcoin."
This is actually incorrect.
1 trillion investment would not just double the value of bitcoin but 10x it!!!!
Edit: Incredible how far one can go without a basic investment mathematics. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:27:31
Higher the adoption higher the threat.  
The US government ia not ready to offer an alternative to Bitcoin. 
That is why the Bitcoin is not institutionally atacked yet. 
The game theory would dictate that they would develop a strategy based on anticipation what their major competition would do, China mostly. 
Outright banning would be a very poor choice of the strategy. It is not to say that they may make a poor choice though.

It's working perfectly fine, I agree. That is not enough to become widely accepted though.
There are so many bits to be added and improved, like LN, atomic swap, business adoption and so on.
To be perfectly clear there is no a single business yet that built its strategy on adopted blockchain technology. That speaks for itself.
We are on a right path, but far from concrete product.

Everyone else was congested at that time, yesterday rocketing price
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:20
The general trend is upwards heading that way.
This dip is caused by an attack created by Bcash people, not the first time this has happened.
 
They waited for Coinbase to list Bcash so in order to stop a sale on a massive scale (140k Bcash was locked on the exchange, from August fork) the majority "owners" dumped Bitcoin, creating panic among ppl who had a weak hand. 
It was also an insider work catching many ppl out of guards. 
If you look at the combined price of Bcash and Bitcoin you would realise this just a pump of Bcash on account of Bitcoin.
If it was a process that lasted for months, then it might it would be worry, but because was sudden and obviously planned to cause panic, it will be short lived.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:40:24

Bitcoin is reacting (dip) exactly how anyone who wants to protect itself would react.

It is a very volatile asset class, and ppl would invest in what they investing for hundreds of years in the time of crisis - gold.
Bitcoin needs a few years to establish itself in the psyche of ppl as a safe bet. It is far from that yet.

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:56:06
I think he is wrong on two accounts;
Andreas never said this was good for miners, nor he would ever observe it from that aspect. He also never observed who own the exchanges. He just said that the futures were not necessarily bad for Bitcoin as the people who run futures come from different origin to Wall Street banks.
Putting that aside the ex-trader believes that the future would divert investment by institutional money from buying Bitcoin to investing in the futures contracts.
The worst thing that would happen to the ecosystem would be the institutional money buying Bitcoin at this stage. No, we want ordinary people to be on the board now, and then the wall street afterwards, just in case if this turn to be a bubble they to be last in line. That would the first time since this game has been played.

It is a highly speculative asset, as most of the people still ask what it is, after 8 long years.
You and many others are missing the point.
It is irrelevant what it is used for today, as it was completely irrelevant what was internet used in 1991.
It is not just medium of exchange, store value or currency, it is all of it. It is neither of those at the same time.
We, collectively, are searching for use of this amazing concept, given to us, to be able to communicate to other people without relying on someone in the middle telling us what the truth is.
For the first time since our ancestors discovered see shells, we discovered a fundamentally different way of communication and frankly we do not know how and when to use it.

The players on the futures are different to ones who we were seeing until now. 
It will be larger quantities and much more conservative so I don't think there will be big short or big long.
A big short is placed against big long and this is how it can work only. 
Whether a large number people do long and thus create a mass of positive bet that a big short counteract or a few players do it it is irrelevant. 
The players on the futures are not betting against Bitcoin or those who purchase Bitcoin, they can only bet against those betting against them. 
If there is no one to bet for Bitcoin there will be no one Bet against. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:06:17

Milk doesn't cost 1400% more yet, is the construct you're looking for. 
The phenomenon is that all central banks artificially keep interest rate low, therefore there is no currency that hyperinflation can be measured by. 
As there is no comparable currency the shock that will come from years of suppressed inflation will be catastrophic. 
The blessing is in crypto's existence and ability to suck in all the hyperinflated values and possibly, just possibly, save the day.

It is based on a game theory, which in turn is based on human selfishness and greed.

If you study any bubble so far, it was the institutional money that created it in the first place and at the end, the public held the bag. This time, institutional money is lagging behind the public making the prediction and the graph useless. 
The bubble will burst for many ppl and many cryptos, the bubble may burst for bitcoin too, to be resurrected again and again. 
Any new technology behaved that way but we recorded two, probably inaccurately, tulip bubble and south sea bubble, which had no comparison with a new technology ones like dot com and bitcoin.

I think all this Future issue is over thought and too much of attention is given to it. 
It will not start as a boom at all, some would short some would long but not in a large number or in large quantities 
Don't forget they are dealing with real money and there will be near the balance with slight shifts up or down.

Don’t short bitcoin. Just go to cash when I think it’ll drop the price. Yes I did go bitcoin to cash when it went under 8k. 
I’ll go back to it if we go up now to ~$7.5 and than drop down not lower than to $6.3 establishing a new higher low. 
I have strict stops so can’t lose much of cash.  
In this way I can only increase bitcoin in the bull market and slowly leak cash in a bear market

@_date: 2017-12-15 08:25:14
This is what I meant too. But what I really meant is not that one cannot short Bitcoin because it's mythical power but because it is a new asset class.
Bitcoin as an asset that doesn't behave by rules of commodities and yet it is classed as one.
It doesn't behave as currency and yet it is treated as one. 
It doesn't behave as a pure social network related asset and yet some try to price it as such. 
It will take many months for players, humans and computers, to discover how to play it. 
And guess what, bitcoin will adapt and change again and again. 
That's why one cannot short it, or even long it either.

Bitmain would do it, not for the potential profiting but for maliciousness of destroying bitcoin (core as they call it) in order to shift to Bcash.
What is stopping him is the game theory that stipulates, at this time, if they attempt 51% attack there would be complete obliteration of the cryptospace. 
If they are forced by the change of POW or some other force, as well as if flippening happens, they would attack mercilessly.
As long as Bitcoin has the hashrate increasing at this rate, we are safe.

Bitcoin is based on the game theory and Nash’s equilibrium that is created where all the players keep the game going in a non-cooperative game by being self-enforced trough credible threats. 
The players being users, miners and developers. But in essence miners against/with everyone else.

Fair enough if you do not understand why I do understand. 
If consensus is sought and close to achieve to change POW from SHA256 to whatever SHA might be, this wouldn’t be possible to hold in secret and Bitmain would know that the change is imminent. 
At that point he would be more than equipped to attack 51% and severely damage Bitcoin with price plummeting, and the hashrate migrating to BCH. 
They would mine the higher hashrate network with presumably higher price and profit. 
I argue they would do it only if they are cornered to do so, not otherwise as the game theory is not allowing it.

The logic behind 1MB blocks is that an increase to 2MB would knock out many nodes thus increasing centralization, and it would work only for limited period of time.

If you really want to get into the depth of it you should read the data carefully not superficial and frankly dumb. 
You should read ins and outs to determine whether are these exchanges, dates of receive to determine whether are recent and institutional funds and so on. 
Granted there are a number of early entrants who HODL and fair to them for being visionary in the space. 
Second, miners are in China for the same reason that most of the production of this planet is - cheap labor and energy. 
Third, if there is no large electricity expenditure the game theory would not be applicable and the all crypto ecosystem would not exist

I agree with you on the basis of necessity for the ecosystem to be future proof. 
For the sake of argument, and under the assumption that there is no PoW change, there will be a need for larger and larger memory need for the nodes. 
This will limit the number of people being able to run full nodes.
At the moment it is insignificant cost and it is in a revolutionary spirit to run it, but if the time comes for Bitcoin to become a mainstream not many people would see it that way but would expect to be subsidised or incentivised for looking after the network.

Bitcoin is a new class of assets, not defined truly yet. 
It did go through a very brief "currency " stage, which showed to be unworkable at this scale. 
When/if lightening network is up and running, Bitcoin may recover and retain that characteristic- being used as a currency. 
Problem for that is in fact that is now seen as an investment vehicle with returns on a unprecedented scale. 
According to Gresham Law "bad money drives out good money" and that is exactly what stoped or slowed down Bitcoin use in every day life. 
If you remember USD, backed by gold and strong industry, became the world's good money. 
Well, not the case any more. (Multiple reasons)
So, Bitcoin will be at the stage of investment until it reaches equilibrium with the acceptance use. Or in simple terms when it's price stabilise to the level of cc5% yearly increase compared with USD (level of inflation)
At that stage it will become "store" or "reserve" value  and that will be entirely and unseen before assets that has all characteristics of Currencies, USD, store and reserve value with incredible fluidity.

Piramide scheme is called Piramide because early entrants cannot lose money.

Perhaps I wasn't clear enough; what I meant is that very often money circulating  (M1 and M0) is used to compare to the market value of Bitcoin.
What I am saying there is no need for that to happen for the market capitalisation to achieve the equivalent currency M1 and M0 size. The only fraction of M1 is needed to flow into Bitcoin to produce a multiple of the value.

Because the non safe replay protection and uncertainty of the way the fork will go, ppl will be very cautious to move, creating misbalance between sell and buy orders.

After the fork no one will be selling anything in fear of lack of replay protection, boosting the price while it last. 
After it settles in, people who moved from alts to gain on the fork will move back to alts of their choice. 
The rest of new funding will stay on whatever chain win. Or, alternatively, divided on two chains.

You are very correct in the assessment of risk and dangers to USA HODLers. 
Gold, for example, was illegal to be owned by American citizens from 1933 - 1974.  
There is a twist though, if USA ban or limit or tax or do anything untoward this new technology it will put itself and its citizens back of the train. 
It would be probably the stupidest move since Trump election.

The price seriously dropped in the past but no reflection on the general upwards trend. 
Value of everything is based on the collective imagination of a large group of people. 
Bitcoin's value, as a store or medium of exchange, is not based on present usefulness but the collective imagination of speculative value in the future. 
Bitcoin would not lose its importance if the value fluctuates in larger or smaller extent but only if it's fundamentals are undermined. 
Fundamentals of bitcoin are decentralised, censure resistant financial language distributed to whomever wants to participate.

Gold is an inert metal. By definition useless. 
It is only because was shiny at the time when there was no shiny stable objects people started exchanging it. It was sea shells or jade before that
It was collective thought and consensus that gold had value and was collective imagination that made it valuable.  
Gold was one of the first communication tools at the time of building first communities and empires. (Everyone could speak gold)
We are far far in communication sense from gold era. 
Admittedly it can be good as food additive and also in dental care. Not enough to justify price though.

When I said lose I meant dominance in the world reserve. 
 USD was for many years the reserve. The rest were having only 20ish % of the pot. 
It is slowly decreasing to 60% now. 
It was for many years extremely profitable state of affairs, for USA, UK and Japan. Germany too. 
Since Euro came about and China rise the world. Ew powers would not allow this imbalance to continue. 
It's not about economy or value of bonds and securities, it's about change in power balance. 
For USA losing this advantage will be catastrophic, so it would be much better if no one has it. 
If it is decentralised, immutable and distributed would be a winning combination. 
Guess who can apply?

Money, just like a religion, is a communication tool. 
To compare and understand cryptocurrencies and why they will be successful in overtaking fiat we don't need to go further than Roman empire.
Christianity was adopted by Rome not because they liked it but because the Rome grew to the multiethnic and multi-religious empire.
They needed a communicating glue for all these people.

""So I don't support Core just because I like them or I think they are the best developers but because their interests are aligned with my interests as a user.

I don't think the core devs have "interest" as such. They understand the problem of scalability better and, I believe, they are working imaginatively from the point of preserving the most important characteristic of bitcoin - decentralisation. 
I agree with this motion that decentralised and distributed is making bitcoin censorship resistant which in turn making it immutable. 
Immutable and scarce things are valuable. 
Some users believe that the core devs are wrong in seeking a different path to achieve scalability from the way prescribed in the white paper. 
I believe this to be a dogmatic approach which by definition produce stagnation, not an improvement.

There is a difference between this one and the last one. 
It the last coordinated pump BTC lost value equal to the increase of BCH, indicating the flow from one to another.  
When it stopped the process was reversed with the price combined increase as it would be following normal astronomical 2017 trend. 
This time BTC is static with BCH rising. 
Either new money is pumped in BCH, or more likely there is a flow from BTC to BCH but the price of BTC is compensated with a new money coming in. 
I believe it is later and once pump of BCH stops, the BTC will jump to $10,000 in one day.

It would be foolish to think that Bitcoin is somehow immune to busts and booms. 
There are hundreds of reasons for Bitcoin to suddenly lose its value
FUDs, government regulations, corporate meddling and internal fighting. None of these can seriously damage Bitcoin. 
There is however one that can damage in greater extent that is a fundamental fault in the technology. None observed yet, and due to the simplicity of Bitcoin probably never will
Bitcoin may lose, and did indeed in the past, its value up to 70%.  But it has always reverted and superimposed the previous level. Precisely the reason for collective belief of invincibility. 
HODLers determine the bottom resistance level. 
More HODLers that are convinced Bitcoin will succeed higher the resistance level. More people know about and read about more HODLErs there are. 
Because the technology and logic and philosophy behind is sound.

It will work for some time as more and more people use the transport system. 
You can keep making large and large carriages but these will become very unstable on the railway to the point of topping up.

We are talking about bitcoin as it is fixed in time to be one or the other.  I don't think that is possible at all. 
It is fast evolving, incredibly adaptable and yet immutable entity. 
Immutability is secured by censorship resistance from its decentralised nature and its scarcity. 
It is a currency, speculative investment vehicle and store of value at the same time. 
It is irrelevant if one of these characteristics is prevailing in a particular snapshot in time.

Even if it is correct $90 trillion x 1% = $ 900 billion 
Now it comes a funny bit. You don't have to "buy" 16.7 mil Bitcoin. Or to be clear it will never happen as it is impossible. 
All you need is to buy a fraction of Bitcoins, probably the amount that is circulating around, the maximum would be 5million. Should be fairly easy but laborious to find out how many are in circulation. 
Now if you invest 1 % of $90 trillion (although the investible money is probably larger than $150 trillion),  which equals $900 billion it would rise every Bitcoin to $180k.

Well, it has wider implications. 
You may read occasionally that a certain amount of trillions of money are in circulation, and more often than not these figures are used to indicate a possibility of Bitcoin rise. 
Or even more simple, there is numerous comparison of the value of gold with the value of Bitcoin. 
As if it is needed $7trilliion for Bitcoin to match Gold. 
It is actually the only fraction of gold needed to be poured into bitcoin for bitcoin to rise to the 7trillion market valuation.

Agree, Bitcoin is not a currency, although was invented to be. 
It evolved into store of value where all the other cryptocurrencies flow to     
It is very volatile agree, but not in negative notion in my book. 
Paradoxically, this volatility is the most important characteristic that has influenced the upward movement of its value over the months and years.
What are the causes of this volatility?
1. Daly trading - 5 -20% swings 
2. Media influence i.e. Banning in China, regulatory news and so on - larger swings of 10 - 40%
3. Fundamental faults or perceived faults in the ecosystem i.e. Large magnitude hacks - Mr. Gox - up to 70% swings. 
Evidently, once ecosystem adapts to it, the original price is reversed or even superimposed by new values.   
What I call HODLers resistance is probably the most important factor of defence of the Bitcoin. 
- Core HODLers which would not sell Bitcoin even it falls below 30% or more of the present value. These are true believers in the technology, probably from technical background or due to their ideological stance. They would resist even most serious attack on the ecosystem. 
- Base HODLers are creating resistance to the point of 30-40 % of loss. These are investors who would resist any FUD or China news as they understand fundamentals of the technology and are investing in the long period. However if the basic of the technology is attacked successfully these would back down. 
- General HODLers, or I call them WOBBLErs (5 -30% swings) are weak to any attack in smaller or greater degree. These are comprised of investors who can hardly afford or even borrowed funds to invest. So called weak hands. 
These would be prone to panic sale which can be created with larger movement on the market such as those created by Whales. 
Also they would be panic selling when any negative news penetrates the media. 
(Most infamous Jamie Dimon expression of opinion)
Unfortunately they are pray to professional day traders who base their game on the amateur quasi traders' habits. 
They constantly try to time the market and unfortunately they would ultimately lose. 
Why is volatility beneficial than?
For the simple fact that the price bounced several time over the period of 8 years regardless of the cause. This in turn created a collective sentiment of Bitcoin invincibility. One just need to look at news over the period to realise how many time Bitcoin was declared dead. 
The continuous overall upward movement of the value coupled with media interest attract attention of more and more participants. 
Not everyone will go into depth of technology or ideology behind Bitcoin, but those who do do will put themselves as well as their money into Core, or Base HODLers and this is where a new level of resistance will be set. 
This growth of the resistance level has a huge upward room due the the fact that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still very far from mainstream acceptance. 
Bitcoin is in bubble. Sure. Everything is bubble if placed in correct time frame.
