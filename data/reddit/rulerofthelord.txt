Ouch. Yeah, i'll just wait, as long as nothing happens with Intel I'll be fine...
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:46:15
I was looking at it yesterday and was about to purchase, but then I decided I would think about it overnight... Good on you though!
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:26:39
I’m going to keep my order in for now, unless I can find it somewhere else where it is in stock from a approved seller. From what i’ve seen, they are all either out of stock or really overpriced.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:17:54
I bought using paypal, I think you can ask for a refund, but i haven’t tried it before.. if you can find out how, i’d like to know :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:01:07
I'd like to point out that they did push back the ship date, but they did give you free shipping! --At the cost of an increased price for the ledger (Now €79.99). So really, you end up paying the same... Maybe a little more... 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:40:42
Well, considering ledger is all out of stock for a few months, its all I(we) got sadly...
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:58:28
This is what happens when I procrastinate lmao
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:18:57
Huh.. chances are that’s not working anymore is it... website is still running though..
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:13:53
If someone exploits meltdown I mean..
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:03:11
Good point, but the 3rd party factor is still what pushes me back... Also, there is no estimated ship date, they might just be putting up an item they don't have until they get another batch from ledger... (If I understand Amazon correctly, i may be very wrong).
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:56:03
Yeah, but the seller isn't ledger, some 3rd party. I want it directly from ledger, also it cost about $130, compared to the now $95 on ledger. Guess I just got to suck it up and hope nothing happens with the Intel meltdown stuff...
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:17:52
You might be, check the website and your order status. Mine has a message saying it won’t be shipped until after March 20th
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:02:02
Yeah... i think you were also pushed back.. Pre-order is for orders to be shipped After March 20th. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:58
Some people I know bought at 19.5k, now they are complaining. At least they aren’t panic selling (yet)
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:47:28
USB Asics are more for fun than to make a profit. I mine on a 980Ti and 970 (sometimes) which are from my gaming computers 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:59:09
Correct, got ahead of myself :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:13:50
Remember a week ago when we broke $3,000..
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:04:55
What fucks me up is that I need an ID to pay with paypal. Is it different for a bank account?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:43:36
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:39:24
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:08:50
Definitely! 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:43:48
I will forever hold! Theres no point in cashing out since if i hold it in a few years i can have much more, plus whatever more i get for mining
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:37:40
I mine using nicehash, so i get paid in btc for mining alts mainly
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:33:52
I-i-i have $40
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:12:47
Congrats! Where did you buy it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:34:07
Exactly. Cant predict everyone else. Look at Bitcoin cash though, it rose after a while but then dropped again. Still, no one knows if that will happen again or not. Thats a good idea though, probably do the same now that you say that
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:58:22
It’s $6,845 in coinbase for me currently
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:15:43
Never gonna sell. Not like i got alot anyways but hey
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:26:43
Probably gonna sell that when it peaks. Free money afterall! Anyway, i dont think it will succeed. If i does, oh well what are the odds, i missed out.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:42:57
PM me if you find anything, I could also use the info.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:57:44
Hey! My mom uses that!
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:55:22
If i were to guess it would be power costs.. then again power costs vary... and it depends what you are using to mine...
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:23:26
Its a pretty easy choice.. money is money.. worthless if you dont have someone you love
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:11:23
If China bans, you buy ;). It does help though, more people will hear about bitcoin helping it grow
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:16:07
Thanks, will definitely switch now! 
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:34:21
Its never too late, as long as theres profit. Mine away!
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:38:58
I have the same question. I'm thinking about breadwallet (ios and andriod) as that will support it and other people say its alright and they will support BCC. My issue would be after that, i'm using electrum now but i would have to stay in breadwallet because elecrum doesnt support BCC.. and i would much rather have a desktop wallet.. Anyways just spreading the information.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:48:40
Found this on just now!  
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:38:41
i switched to eletrum specifically to support BCC because someone else said it would smh. im not paying any more fee's to go onto another that does support
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:52:56
Nothing, the bitcoin cash you couldve had would just be gone. Also dont use coinbase for a wallet, if you pass it all over to electrum then after the fork (aug 1) you wont have the bcc because it doesnt support it, but you will be able to claim it by moving your private key to a wallet that does support bcc
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:56:25
Honestly, it could sky rocket or drop low. We don't know, its really random to predict
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:57:23
Thanks! Appreciate the downvote!
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:16:37
I won't, thank you for your response, i'm gonna see about switching to Electrum as someone else said.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:37:28
second this
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:44:06
Personally, i'm going to mine until the 31st and until the whole BCC thing is settled (after about 72hours max) ill start mining again. Since you are starting now, i would wait until all the dust settles. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:44:45
I second this :)
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:55:47
Looks... Interesting...
