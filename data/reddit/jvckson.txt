Even if the US made bitcoin illegal. There is no possible scenario in which the whole world would do so. Illegal activity will still be performed with crypto. Bitcoin is an idea. You can ban ideas but you can’t get rid of them.

This sub is turning to absolute garbage because of old news with clickbait titles. If you want to post something from a year ago to inform new members of the community, at least put the date in the damn title.

“I have seen things. Don’t ask me how.”
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:52:52
Because why should I trust anyone but myself with my financial independence/security. HODL to change everything.
