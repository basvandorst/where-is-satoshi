I've been in since 2010, If I haven't sold by now I never will. Shit thanks to bitcoin I got 3 apartment complexes who's revenues I use to buy more coin every month. Personally, I'd love it to dip lower to 2k so I can grab a hell of a lot more. But I don't feel that's very likely with where we currently are in the market

That sentiment didn't really overtake the market till it hit 3.5k started small at 6k, but 3.5k is when it went mass wide. So yeah, just starting now so maybe another 50% or more drop till it becomes mass sentiment. Which is good cause then I get to buy a hell of a lot more.

Shit yeah I saw that post! They took it down? Fucking idiot mods -_-, it's thanks to them we can't put out the proper image for market sentimate for a bull run to start. This is how it's been for the 9 years I've been in this game. If they don't allow that market sentimate to naturally go to the top well never be able to rally the bulls

~~I started with 2100 coins, the hodling  number everyone was going after in 2010. Sold 100 coins in 2017 to buy myself some properties and now living off that retired. Slowly buying back the 100 I sold with the apartment complex rents too. But I'm still holding a little over 2k coins just for the offchance it breaks the million mark one day and I can buy a town~~ 
*Yeah bitcoin is dead I sold all my coins, fuck this sector it's never coming back*
