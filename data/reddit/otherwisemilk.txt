I downloaded the bluewallet like everyone recommend and received 5 Satoshi from this nice guy on here so I can test out LN but I'm having trouble sending it to my "new HD segwit" or "new segwit" card. Can someone help?

I don't want reddit to do the work for me. I just thought maybe reddit can point me in the right direction. u/BashCo already suggested I use BTCpay as a fiat ramp. ultimately I want to have a LN fiat ramp where anyone can send BTC or cash to this machine and seconds later receive the BTC or cash minimizing fees and wait time. the current bitcoin ATM is slow and fees are stupid high.

You nailed it. LN is complicated for new users. Most people prefer simple and easy to understand. Imagine telling your grandma "you may not really have an understanding of how lightning works... Do some research if you get a chance, wish you the best." because it's too complicated.

Anonymous transaction and it's accepted almost everywhere. Just because you dislike cash doesn't mean it's not useful.

The Lightning network. 
The fact that it's not grandma friendly. that your funds gets locked up. large transactions have problems sending. That it's a hassle to have to maintain an open channel with every vendor you transact with restricting your freedom to eat/shop at new places. That you don't really own your money with a custodial wallet. It's a hassle to have to pay exchange fees to convert your LN coins to Bitcoins especially if there is a minimum and/or maximum amount. That there's no clear roadmap or time frame for any company that's working on the LN, I really wanna know what's next to look forward too. 
This is why I will just stick to using Bitcoin 1st layer. Even tho it takes an hour for 6 confirmations it's still simple and straight forward.

Where would you draw the line of the Lightning Network failing?
If LN stays in beta by always saying it's 18 months away then it can't fail right? It's like pausing a game of Tetris forever and saying you've never lost a Tetris game.
Personally I'll be researching other coins and reallocate my portfolio to coins that has solved scaling issues. If no other coins exist then I'll be moving my money into Gold and Silver.

Honestly I like Bitcoin but I hate the Lightning Network. It will be cheaper if you just accept Bitcoin directly with 0 or 1 confirmation vs having to maintain some 2nd layer solution that's even more complicated. There are still tons of issues like lost funds, having to stake your coins, failure rate, fees in opening and closing a channel, ect. The LN has an army of programmers trying to solve these issues for a long time now but the only answer we get is "soon" or "LN is still in development".  I have LN funds that are stuck in my wallet because the fees to take them off is much higher than it's worth. Also I hope your questions get answered because I too would like to know.

Agreed, I stated I will stick to using Bitcoin. I just stated why I dont like it because it was a response to the OP

Where can I find the road map for Lightning network?
@_date: 2019-03-15 02:25:02
The ATM should have used the Lightning network if they wanted fast transaction.
@_date: 2019-03-03 00:48:54
I just thought it'd be a good idea to accept more then just cash and plastic.

Idk if someone can help me with this but I'm trying to set up a wallet where customers can send transactions through the LN so they can get their product instantly, but I also need the funds to be sent to an exchange as soon as it arrives via LN so it can be sold for fiat or a stable coin by a trading bot. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 03:59:23
I too want to try out the LN but my address keeps expiring.

What will happen if the major Lightning network Hubs were attacked and taken down during times like these when block sizes are (getting) full? Will the on chain fees skyrocket since all channels are forced closed and has to settle on chain? and will the funds get stuck in limbo if your balance was too small to pay the miner fees?

They sent bitcoin over radio frequency (RF).

I agree, adding on to that. I think having the option to keep your coins through a centralized authority and/or being your own bank is a great idea. The flexibility will reach a broader audience and once more people are comfortable about storing their own private keys then they can switch to it. Big companies tech companies like Google will keep your private keys safe even if in the unlikely event its data base gets hacked. The leaked keys will be out there but it will still be encrypted so you will always be able to move your coins to a safer location.

I'm just making it clear for whoever is reading your comment. Not everyone knows the acronym for radio frequency. Especially if they didn't understand the original post in the first place.

So you have to fund your Lightning network wallet with your BTC to send it to another's person's Lightning network with BTC? Why don't we just convert the whole bitcoin network into the Lightning network? That way we can all enjoy faster transaction and new users won't have to jump through extra hoops to have access to fast transaction.

Why didn't you just make a text post? Then you wouldn't have deal with the shitty 140 character limit.

I was introduced to bluewallet when I first asked about it too. I had almost $1 in it from tips and stuff but I couldn't withdraw it to the block chain because apparently since you dont own your coins on bluewallet you have to use an exchange to get your money on chain. Then more complications came up like the exchange was out of money, then the exchange had a minimum withdraw of like $1.20 so I couldn't withdraw it.

I think he means if bitcoin gets adopted then transaction fees would cost more than the product you're buying so it's not even worthless, it's costing you money.

bitcoin dominance used to be like 90%+ it has been overall on the down trend since 2013. OP is just celebrating small victories and ignoring the big picture.

why the sudden hate for custodial wallets? people were recommending them to me when I asked about a LN wallet.
