Serious question.
Why whould you want to accept a currency that might extremely degrade in value in a few hours and other way round, why would you want to pay with something, that might be worth way more in a few hours?

Thinking exactly the same.
I always wanted to know how many people who visit this subreddit own Bitcoin to make FIAT-profit. 
I'm pretty sure its easily 90% of the people here.
The only reason why the price is sky rocketing the last few months, are the news about Bitcoin millionaires and bought Lamborghinis etc.
It really is simple economic theory that as soon as people start exchanging into fiat money, supply rises and the price dips.
Im also pretty sure that the price will crash once it hit's standard payment method and will be accepted at sites like Amazon.

And who's going to give away credits if banks aren't needed anymore? It's ridicilous to think banks will just disappear in the next 50 years. 
The normal bank account is a product that just costs money and doesn't earn you any. Guess they'll be happy to get an alternative but maybe we'll have one in 25 years+ considering how ridiculiously expensive and inefficent Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are at the time.

Because I can't decide who to give it to and factor in hundreds of factors to minimize my risk of payment fallout?

As someone who's thinking of buying BC, what is the use?
Afraid of buying now as it has no real counter part and I can't spend it on anything really when the bubble bursts?

Yeah cause you cant get drugs otherwise. What would be the benefit of using bitcoin to pay for services?
