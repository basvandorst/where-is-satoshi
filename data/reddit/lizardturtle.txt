32K volume... either a whale is dumping or we got some massive panic-selling going on here -- best case scenario for holders is going to be both of those things occurring. Start timing and buy 'em up boys

Just found out about Gemini yesterday, thought it sounded pretty neat. Are the fees similar to Coinbase now?

I still don't see why people would want to use it to buy stuff at this stage -- it's too early. An $8 pizza today is a $16 pizza tomorrow. It's usage as a currency is still far, far away from being realized. That being said, I applaud your dedication to using it for its intended purpose at such a volatile time.

This seems to be how it works. I've been watching the price for around 2 years now since the Great Boom of 2017, and briefly played around with using it to buy stuff in 2015/2016. Never bought any but it definitely seems to fluctuate in monthly cycles. Roller-coaster ride of an asset to own, that's for sure. Still a long ways out from being a feasible store of value and fully-fledged currency IMO though.

Appreciating my Bitcoin by taking yours out of circulation? You shouldn't have! Too kind.
On a more serious note: you are responsible for maintaining any accounts/wallets that you store Bitcoin in. If you lost access to a wallet, you're likely screwed. But if it was on an exchange, you may be able to recover your account. Seek out customer support from whoever was holding your stuff.

The lower the price goes, the more you can tell all of the things people say on here is nothing but pure speculation/bs. Bitcoin had its moment — that bubble is popping. Perhaps we'll see a day where it blows up again, but the key word there is "perhaps."
I'm really glad I didn't chuck any money into this thing.

I'm not sure why you would convert an asset with a market value of $0 to $0, but power to you brother!
