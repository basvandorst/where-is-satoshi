He's an idiot. BTC is supposed to be a currency, but for some reason morons think you should hold it, which is the exact opposite of a fucking currency. Nobody knows where it will go, it doesn't have to go up. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:35:59
Sorry but the USD is still the primary currency by far, so using something nobody uses as your frame of reference is just stupid.

You don't have to count having sex as a fucking activity. I know most of the people here are damn nerds but it's pointless to throw in an activity like that. Yeah, I take dumps everyday but don't count it as leisure time.
It really is hard to imagine, I mean what time do you go to bed? Are you out there throwing the Frisbee till 11PM? There is a ton of downtime at night, you just sit there with a lamp and write? I guess when you have enough money, sailing can be a daytime activity but lets be real, most people that's not a realistic thing they can just go do, same with hosting drone sessions. 
Also not sure what 'attractive people' coming to a group session has to do with anything. I go out with 'attractive people' as well, I wouldn't mention it randomly. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:39:05
Sorry but that argument only works if the uses of it are tied to the value of BTC in of itself, which it's not.
1 BTC yesterday got you ~7.5k worth of goods
1 BTC right now gets your 6.8k worth of goods

You can't use the past to accurately predict something as speculative as bitcoin. Just because YOU said it will be worth hundreds of thousands doesn't make it anymore true than anyone else's prediction.

@_date: 2018-03-21 12:50:59
Yea because the 5 people selling shit for bitcoin out there just sell it for so cheap right? You can buy the same shit without going through the hassle of using a currency nearly nobody in the world actually uses, you probably got a house/car that you couldn't get with fiat because your credit sucks ass and you couldn't get a loan.
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:17:50

with excuses like that, even it bitcoin drops to 1000 and sits there for years you moronic holders will still think it's going to the moon.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:23:35
Exchanges getting hacked left and right, Whales causing the market to tank, a lack of interest from retail investors, price volatility meaning you can lose a few grand if selling for bitcoin, etc etc...You delusional hodlers don't look at it from a normal point of view, you've brainwashed yourselves into thinking it's gonna moon again. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:26:02
Please do not pay your employees in BTC unless you want to go out of business. That 'worthless shit fiat' is what the world runs on, regardless of whether or not BTC hippies think it's bad. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:22:13
No idea, just saying you can think it has all the fundemental value in the world but unless people are willing to value it at 10k/100k/1mil/whatever, the price isn't going to do anything. Just because a few people think it's valuable doesn't mean other people see it that way. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:51:01
Well what kind of jobs do they do? You listed one, but you know as well as I do that 99% of startups fail, it's hard to imagine you can just get a kid some money from him saving up and then they just become successful. It's all well and good but shit isn't easy, there has to be a good handful of people you've mentored that just didn't make it or their business failed. 
Idk how you think just anyone can sub in their TV/Internet entertainment for actually acting on set though, that's not realistic for really anyone. Sure it's fun to do activities, but what the fuck do you do when you come home and it's dark? Most people are usually up hours late at night, do you just sit there staring at the wall?
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:04:41


Not really, just because they sold doesn't mean there's anymore bitcoin in circulation than there was currently. You had 1 BTC, you spent it. The seller than has that 1 BTC briefly before converting (selling) it. Whoever buys it now has that 1 BTC. You are creating liquidity (although if it's a small purchases it won't change anything).

and 1 BTC was worth 20k 4 months ago.
1 BTC now is now worth 8k
What you get for your BTC has decreased heavily, why would that not be a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:11:24
Exactly, but people here are blinded by the lambos and think that because it mooned once it just HAS to moon again. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:42:58
This shit is exactly why bitcoin won't be adopted in the near future. Look at all these scam sites, and look at everyone's recommendations for securing it. 
All these keys and shit, multi-factor auth, wallet types, hardware and software wallets, nobody wants to go through that to keep their shit safe. They want to have a bank that does all this shit for you, which won't happen because its not regulated.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:17:05
people are stupid and think that because bitcoin uses this great blockchain technology it should be valuable, but the value of it is only what people are willing to pay for it. They have to make a case for why someone would pay X amount for it.

The technology is good, not disputing that. It has uses. But, I'm talking about praying the price will moon. We don't know what it's value is, but bitcoin isn't the first or only tech to use blockchain. There's no reason why it couldn't crash.

Convert your currency to something that nearly everyone who accepts it will just convert right back, the value of what you can buy with it slides like hell. 
Like it or not it's not a currency yet, any store that accepts bitcoin for something, is valuing that 'something' at a price in BTC equal to it's value in USD.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:03:45
history of what, mooning? it hasn't been used for anything, it's way too volatile to be used for a currency right now, and the only people interested in it are people thinking they're gonna get rich.
you're the .0001% if you're actually thinking it's the future. some enjoy that, they think they're getting in 'early', but for we don't know what it is yet. speculation is all.
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:00:43

@_date: 2018-03-09 20:00:42
you're right about the news, I get that, and it's one of the reasons that you have a good stop point to minimize your losses. I personally don't think TA is much use in bitcoin unless you're day trading, in which case it's very easy to just watch price swings for lower-lows. Price patterns are real though, they exist for a reason. An ascending wedge is bullish because the price is showing higher-lows, meaning buyers are coming UP to the sellers, showing a possible bullish move. 
I think we're talking about two different things: trading and investing.

It's interesting reading this thread, but you really do make it sound easy, and if it was, everyone would be a millionaire.
The gist of your thing is, basically renting property, correct? You don't really flip or invest in the real estate itself but rather you just buy for cash then rent out?
Sounds intriguing but I know personally I could never spend even a year of my 20's living in a fucking closet or shaking up in bunk beds. Normal people don't do that, you really can't have a life working 80 hrs a week and living in a bunkbed with no cell phone.  
I just can't really see where you get the numbers. Working 80 hrs/week  @ 16/hr is about 800 after taxes, pay 300/rent, 500 + 2400 (800 for the next 3 weeks) leaves you with about 2900 for the month. I mean, I guess doing that for 3-4 years would you get enough for a property. 
If that one guy rents those apartments out that were 45k for 2, they must be in shit condition. How does he get his money back? Nobodies gonna pay that much for shitholes.

Channels that big, especially on something like bitcoin, hardly mean anything. You can see it broke out of 1 channel slightly then fell right back down, so you drew another line at another point. It's hard to use them for anything because of false-breaks like this. Unless the channel is very defined, it's not very useful. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:56:19
Basically he's saying you live on nothing, no internet/TV/car, eat the cheapest food out there, so you're only paying very low rent each month, combined with working 80/hrs a week, over the course of a few years I think.

TA is used to give good entry points and determine risk vs reward. getting a good R/R is what you need, forget everything else. All it's about is taking a position where there's minimal risk for the largest possible reward. The % of time you're right means nothing if your R/R is good. You could only be right 30% of the time but if you take 3 small losses and have 1 big win, you're in the green.

Check google statistics, check any search engine's stats, the numbers are dwindling for any terms related to crypto. Services left and right (Amazon, Microsoft, Reddit) are removing BTC payment options. '''normie''' money is not coming in, the volume on every coin is dwindling. You'd be right by saying blockchain tech has good interest, which it does, but the currencies themselves are losing interest. 
Also, 8k is 40% of 20k, so yes you could say currently it is down 60% from it's high. At it's low, it was 70% down from it's high. A healthy correction doesn't lose 70% of it's value. The stock market is in a correction right now. From it's peak to it's low of the correction, its barely an 11% drop.

You say loser addicts and shit, but you're the exception. You can't really talk down to other people for something they enjoy, it makes no sense. People like going out and getting drunk with friends, it's not because they're degenerates, it's because it is fun. Same with occasionally playing games or watching TV, it's only wrong because you think it is.

This matters how?
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:26:05
Yep, you're right.
Think of the 200MA or the 50/200MA golden cross. Realisticly, those things mean nothing. It's literally just a number. Why are the last 200 closes added up and divided by 200 significant, instead of the last 201 or 199? People have been conditioned to see 200 as a hard resistence/support place, same with 50/200, people are conditioned to think that way and that influences market sentiment.

I'm not sure who you date has anything to do with it, I'm was saying you literally are worse off physically and mentally than in your 20's, it's a fact. You can blame addiction and shit, and yes a fucking alcoholic would probably be healthier if he quit, but having a few beers on the weekends with friends isn't bad like you make it out to be. 
2 years is a damn long time for some people. What is a timeline you're looking at? You get someone who quits their job, they do what exactly to live the way you speak of? Move to a city with one of those programs, live in a bunkbed for 2 years, then what? Start a business that has a 1% chance of being successful? There's tons of people who do what you speak of, save a ton of money only to fail when they start a business. I think you speak of only success stories without pointing out the failures. Most people who quit their salaried-job and try to do what you do, would fail.

You guys who say that's its not inflationary and try to say how it's value has moon'd as an argument for it's use as a currency need to realize that a currency is to be spent.

If you're going to meme like other threads here about the value of the dollar tanking over 100 years, you fail to realize that's how it works. You need that to happen, spending money causes that to happen, investing causes that to happen. You cant have a currency that's used while still ballooning in value.

You must've been out of shape in your 20's. I know people like that, in their 40's who's doctors say they're in better shape, only because they were out of shape in their 20's. Unless, you're magical and a total stray from the norm, because humans are more physically fit in their 20's, you can ask a scientist. Same with women. Some studies are even proving a few beers a day is good for your long term health. 
And is good to be better primed for success, but you make it seem like in 2 years all your responsibilities with be over with, which isn't true. It takes years and years of busting your ass to make whatever business your doing work and relieve you of the financial burden.  
What is the general game plan you recommend? You do 2 years of no spending and work 80hrs/week? What about a normal salaried job where you just cut spending, or does it have to be some blue collar shit like you were talking about? Why don't more people do this, you make it sound so simple.

Yea and 1 piece of shit is still 1 piece of shit, that argument is stupid. You can go ahead and not compare it to fiat but because 99.99% of the world uses fiat, you have to make the comparison. If there were just as many places that valued their goods in BTC (not in it's USD/EUR relative price) then you'd be on your way, but that's not the case.
1 BTC in December would buy you 15k worth of goods
1 BTC today will buy you 7k worth of goods
If you find me a case where something that cost 1 BTC back in Dec costs 1 BTC today, then you'd be right. But that's not the case, that thing will now be 2 BTC.

in terms of BTC and shit driven purely by hysteria you're right but tech analysis is a thing and works for a reason, regardless of the direction if you're going up or down. There are plenty of traders who trade purely based on support and resistance levels, and they are successful for a reason. 
the 200ma is seen so much as support/resistence because it is. you think it's just pure luck that thing like that happen? Like I said I agree with you on BTC because it's driven so much by public opinion, but on regular stocks and commodities it does work, not all the time though.

Of course it is based on past price movements, nobody can predict future price movements. But you can use as a guide to help interpret where you think prices might go. If tech analysis didn't get exist, how do momentum traders play the opening bell at all? They use volume, flag patterns and L2 data, none of which is fundamental (Because many of these momentum plays are companies that are trash).
Same thing goes for the 200MA being used as support/resistance, you can find a ton of instances of it being hit and traders then pushing prices in the opposite direction. Of course it's not 100% reliable, but it can be used to make a calculated entry point.

Of course it already mooned, that's why the odds if it running up again are so slim. That was entirely FOMO driving that run, there is no real valuation it's all speculation. I don't know why people can't be fine with it being worth 10k/5k/whatever, they expect it to be 100k+, I guess because of that pipedream of getting rich.

USD is backed by the government and wildly accept around the world. Also, you don't invest in the USD, you use the USD to invest in companies. 
Bitcoin is backed by nothing. It's hardly accepted anywhere in the world, so if it dies nobody really loses anything. In order for the dollar to lose it's value a dramatic world event and shift in economic power would have to take place.

TA trading works if you know what to look for and realize that it isn't a price prediction but rather a way to make an educated guess to put the odds in your favor. 
You are right about the idiots on twitter though. People in general will be hesistent to say they wrong calls but more than happy to share their wins. People daytrade because you get in and out quickly and don't suffer huge losses. You invested at the right time, good for you, but investing is not always the right idea.

People are what gives it value, and if nobody adopts it and it's never used it becomes useless.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:46:44


You guys are getting further and further out there with this. Nobody knows what it is yet, it so early in the crypto stage that every single coin out there including btc could die, very easily, making all your bitcoins worthless. It's not even good 'money' yet because everything you can buy it is still based on it's value to another currency and this value fluctuates by double-digit percentages every day. If you had 20 BTC back in December at 20k, the amount of goods you could buy with it has decreased by over 70% since then. That doesn't sound like the kind of money you should want to own. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:08:00
Way more companies died than blossomed after the dot com crash. That small number of people who were successful were smart by picking assets that stayed around. Most people weren't so lucky. The same will happen with Bitcoin. It will probably die, and many other coins will before something actually useful comes about, and that small number that get into that will be successful.

@_date: 2018-04-05 14:27:51
Just because it's written in code doesn't mean it has value. Hard to say it gives people security when exchange hacks have been happening at a constant rate, and bitcoin isn't guaranteed unlike your money in the bank which is federally insured. If bitcoin becomes widely adopted then it could see some sort of medium of exchange that is safe, but as of right now people like to know that if they pay someone for services/goods and don't get their return, they can at least do something about it. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:27:00

Most end up playing SPX/SPY options. The big tank today in the afternoon was called in the chatroom. Of course nobody knows with certainty but the point is to get in with a low risk/high-reward. I believe at around 2 or so today SPX was hitting an upper trendline, so it was called. You take that trendline as your risk, and the reward was at least a 4x move.

It's just delusional people who missed out on last years get rich quick scheme so they've convinced themselves it's going to happen again. The funny thing is people actually thinking it'll hit 1 Million. It's ludicrous, but in their heads they're fantasizing about that new yacht their gonna get with all their money.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:57:28


Because people here say it will of course. Everyone here is going to be rich, don't you get it? Every poster here is going to be a millionaire when it moons to 1million.

What's your endgame, in 5 years the apocalypse happens, all currencies become useless and the world just magically adopts bitcoin as the one world currency?
Of course this plan also involves the prices going to 1,000,000 and you getting rich in the process right?
Like it or not fiat is here to stay. You can fear-monger all you want but there's no sense in you thinking a currency used by 99.99999% of the world is doomed and a currency used by 0.000001% of the world is bound to succeed. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:06:12
Its a combination of both. The didn't randomly shoot up because everyone all of a sudden, in 45 mins was bullish again on it. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:02:02
That's nothing compared to the amount of people dropping it. You realize that Soros and co. basically said they are interested in the space, nothing about actively investing in bitcoin. If anything, they'll short the market and fuck over all you dumb hodlers. Billionaire companies are dropping support, interest is incredibly low and no new money is coming in. No, a goldman exec taking a job at a crypto fund doesn't mean that fund is going to start dumping cash into crypto immediately.

Yep because the past prices predict the future right?
Why isn't everyone in the world buying based off this ground breaking advice?


No new money is here to lift it. Normies didn't know about bitcoin back then. It was the early adopters, crypto dudes in the beginning then everyone and their grandma started buying it and were scared the fuck out of it.
Sorry but there's no new money left. That's just the reality. I'm not saying it won't have it's uses, but this sub would be a whole lot more tolerable if people focused on actual uses of bitcoin and improving it rather than focusing solely on the price because they want to hit a million so they can retire their fat asses.

He's just some moron either larping or happens to live in a place where they accept bitcoin. Which is probably a pain in the ass considering goods aren't valued in bitcoin but rather in the currency of wherever he's living so his buying power fluctuates a lot every day. What a shit living. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:58:54
What a sound argument. With that logic, what's to stop it from hitting 1,000,000,000,000,000? Nothing right?
Oh wait, how about the fact that you need new money to poor into this speculative as fuck technology and nobody in their right would mind would pay anywhere close to that for a coin. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:19:36
The problem with fundamental analysis is you really have to know the sentiment of the broader market. Plenty of stocks have been tanking recently even though their growing like crazy. Same can be said for stocks that are jumping while having the same or even lower numbers.

Yep, it was a get rich quick scheme. It's hilarious seeing people thinking that was actual adoption when in reality it was people who just thought it was an investment that was skyrocketing.

You can't compare the number 70 down to the number 300 or 2000 up, because those numbers are limitless. The highest possible correction/crash is 100, so 70/100 is a lot. A shitton actually.
Problem is morons here will always have that argument that it was 800$ a year ago, so basically even if bitcoin goes to 900$ they'll still be saying 'BUT IT'S STILL UP COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:12:04

@_date: 2018-04-05 12:30:05
people for some reason think if bitcoin became the world currency that there would be total anonymity, with nobody ever requiring to put down any piece of info.
So basically no more buying shit online because there's no name or address to send too, and the chance for being scammed because no chargebacks is high. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:11:29
They do this because people lose their money when shit gets hacked and they lose their digital money and run to the banks requesting them to open an investigation and get their money back. 
But of course you have the tin foil nuts who think big banks are trying to suppress bitcoin and crypto from taking over!!!1!!
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:43:36
There's going to have to be some sort of middleman system to ensure people don't get scammed or adoption is never going to happen. Most bitcoin enthusiasts do agree on this. You can keep your coins stored like you keep cash under your mattress free from hacks, but your shit isn't always going to be on your person, it won't get spent that way and in the end you'll just have people hoarding it like they are now. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:25:12

You already had your FOMO-induced normie buying spree, sorry there's no new money left to trick into this ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:04:40
Comparing the banks to regular people is stupid. Just think about it logically, if everyone started hoarding their USD and stopped spending, what would happen? In what way could that possible be good for an economy? No spending, businesses make less money, they're forced to either pay their employees less and or close all together...it's not a good thing. Gold isn't used as an everyday currency now anyways, it's basically just a hedge investment.

There's good reason for it, the bank doesn't want thousands of customers complaining about being scammed, the exchange shutting down or random 3rd parties selling them shit. I think people here severely underestimate how much people want a 3rd party regulator to complain too if something goes wrong.

Soro's made his money by making very low-risk/high reward  investments/trades. He won't take something if there's potential for a huge loss - which there wasn't on his famous billion dollar short (it either went his way, which it did, or didn't go his way but stayed where it was).
No way he enters the market now. The news didn't say he was going to actively start trading it, but that he was interested. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:09:44
BTC is nowhere close to being considered on the same planet as gold yet. Gold has been a store of value and safe haven like other metals for thousands of years, bitcoin is a manipulated, speculative digital currency who's price flucates nearly 10% every single day.
