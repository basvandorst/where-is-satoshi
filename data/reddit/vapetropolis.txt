You can use colored coins to issue assets, other crypto 2.0 coins can also do this, such as ethereum, nxt and counter party, but you must use their internal currency.  colored coins and mastercoin however do this on top of bitcoin, sort of like http on top of tcp/ip.  We used colored coins to launch an ipo of our business:

[ - Bitcoins for Vaporizers!

This happened to us today too! [Vapetropolis](
I have no idea why we were targeted.  I think it's unfair that bigger vaporizer sites can still use paypal.  They told us over the phone we were violating their terms by selling vaporizers and froze our paypal account.  They told us we have 3 days to take them as a payment option off our site.

We started accepting them in February I believe.  It's probably about 1/3 of our sales.  This is our [webssite!](  Lately though it's been like 80% of sales.  We get like a bunch of sales whenever bitcoin makes a bump higher, it's interesting.
