Ridiculous to state that history shows that countries fall, money collapses, etc but the blockchain continues. The blockchain has such a short history that it's barely worth mentioning.

Look at the exchange. There are dozens of people ready to sell at 600. There are more lined up to sell at 605. And 610. And all along to way up to $1000.
To make a trade at $1000 you'd first need to buy every coin being sold at a price under 1000, which is an absolute shit load.

Again, very low taxes compared to any other developed country, with exception of the USA.


There are guns. Oh you mean legal guns? There are legal guns. Oh you mean legal handguns? Correct, and the reason they were banned was due to a populist conservative overreaction to a shooting spree.


No. It's comparable to the USA, especially once the new unemployment benefits commence. At least the USA has generous social secuwrity andr foodstamp systems.

Interested in your opinion of the world's most stable currency, then. Clearly not the Euro. Nothing from South America, of course. Japan is a mess, most of Sigh East Asia fluctuate wildly. China, of course, fixes itself to the USD (mostly to tie to its stability). 
Switzerland? Maybe once upon a time. Maybe it is still more stable than the USD, but it has challenges -  


So I expect a whole rash of more stable currencies. I really can't think of any.

Wouldn't you need to consider whether the bitcoins you sold increased in value, rather than whether you have a net gain?
For example, you buy 2 BTC for $50 each. Later, you sell 1 BTC for $100. As I read your comment, you'd assume you haven't made any gain, but when you sell the other 1 BTC it will be 'all profit'.  I understand that the IRS would say you've gained $50 on the sold property, and the other 1 BTC has a cost base of $50.

That doesn't follow. It's an incredible technology. Investing in Bitcoin related businesses is probably a good investment opportunity. But neither of these two things mean that investing in Bitcoin directly is a good strategy. The network functions just as well whether 1BTC = $100 or 1BTC = $100,000.
Consider, also, many superior technologies lose out to simpler, cheaper, or better promoted technologies. Betamax, FireWire, whatever Tesla did that Edison smothered... history is littered with good ideas that didn't catch.
If Bitcoin is obviously a good investment then investors would have pumped the price to astronomical levels. That this hasn't happened is a sign that there is still doubt and risk. It's not at all related to the tech itself.

1. Not true. The ruling just clarified this. Previously it was unclear and potentially open to determination in court. 
Of course, the logical assumption would be that any appreciation would be taxable as income or capital gains. Which is exactly what happened.
2. FIFO. Or LIFO, if you prefer. Trivial for someone like Coinbase to implement. Trivial for anyone to gather by crawling the blockchain. I'd write the program myself but it's so easy that I'd be undercut on pricing and wouldn't get a decent return.

I don't care about the 1% but that's just because I don't care. Your argument, meanwhile, is asinine.
The current 1% are mostly high income earners. There are a handful of old money types, and there are some criminals too, but the best majority are business-people who work hard and innovate. People who develop new things, people who make difficult situations work.
The BTC 1% are enthusiasts who got on board early and didn't sell. Granted, some are important in the growth of Bitcoin, but the majority haven't done shit to deserve to be in the top 1%. They were just lucky that what sounded good to them actually was good. You could say clever but hindsight is 20/20 - if Madoff's investors got rich you wouldn't say they eye clever.
Again. I don't give a shit and if you have the money then you deserve it by definition, but to suggest that Bitcoin holders deserve wealth more than the current wealth holders is ridiculous.

MtGox lost almost everything until some users traced the wallets and identified 200 000 coins that hadn't moved. Gox then "found those coins in an old wallet that they thought was empty".

What happens if the point isn't exactly between the two lines? If you "rotate" through a full 360° then you'll end up with two circles - one smaller than the other. 
Thus you'll get the same result by "rotating" one parallel line around a fixed point.
And what happens to all the lines shooting off into the forever? They aren't part of the circle. You only need the single point in the line which is closest to the fixed point (center).
The set of points which are equidistant from a fixed point. No lines, no rotating. You can of course add the lines and rotating, but they aren't necessary. I could also add that it has to be a nice sunny day but that's not necessary either.

If you have a Bitcoin wallet and a credit card - the setup barriers are removed - then it's a lot simpler. It is potentially cheaper; the merchant *should* offer an incentive for purchasing with Bitcoin because they are actually saving that 3% credit card fee. Although you potentially lose purchase protection, you gain wallet protection.
It's not always better, but when you want to buy something online and don't have a credit card within reach then you'll appreciate how simple it is.

The biggest concern I have with Bitcoin is a lingering fear that it's all a circle jerk, and when comments like yours are down voted it heightens that fear.
You're absolutely right. Bitcoin is great when buying online, it's great for person to person purchases, but it's not better than a credit card in a physical store. I normally pay with NFC through my phone. Sure, not everyone has an NFC terminal, but it's a lot more common than Bitcoin. Just as easy and convenient and I get credit card rewards and buyer protection.

Off the top of my head:
Firstly, the post doesn't make sense. "You have to understand the history of money first, and only then can Bitcoin fix it."
1. You can't fix the history of something - the past is the past
2. Use of Bitcoin is use of Bitcoin regardless of what you know about the history of money
Second, there's nothing wrong with debt. As this article indicates, it is very beneficial in financing large plans. It helps us buy cars and houses that would take a very long time to save for. It helps the government provide stimulus during economic turmoil.
Finally, wars over fiat currency won't stop with Bitcoin. Governments will simply have wars over Bitcoin instead.

I think about this a lot. The best consolation I have it that the market capital or total value of BTC isn't enough to support any kind of large volume without serious fluctuations in price. 
The other thing is that as Bitcoin establishes itself as an important part of the financial infrastructure, it's importance and irreplaceably grows. That leads to certainty of value which should make it a good store of wealth like gold.

The reason this doesn't work (and it is a good idea) is that the customer agent has no recourse if your payment "bounces". So I link my bank account and buy with Bitcoin, but I don't actually have any money to buy with.
Of course Coinbase or whoever could absorb that cost but they'll factor it in to your price and it will end up costing more than PayPal.

The cost of mining a coin will always trend towards the value of that coin - do you even get how Bitcoin works? - and if coins become valuable, difficulty increases and pollution will increase.
Pretty simple right? I mean back in 2011 I could mine a coin at home in just a few days using my CPU. It cost just cents in electricity. Now it costs hundreds of dollars in electricity. When / if coin prices jump, the cost of (and therefore pollution involved in) mining will soon follow.

Too bad we don't have exactly 21 million BTC anymore to split amongst the exactly 7 billion people in the world, right? Because if we had all those coins, and we know there will always be exactly 7 billion people in the world, we could share it out perfectly.

No, it's not. It is borrowed from investors. I buy a bond - I'm lending the government money.


No, it's not.
Firstly, check the history of government debt. It's been higher as a percentage of GDP and it decreased significantly (it doesn't go to zero because it doesn't need to and it's illogical to do so).
Secondly, when bonds mature the government can easily issue new bonds. It's a debt that can be rolled indefinitely. The *real* (inflation adjusted) cost of writing bonds is negligible if it exists at all.


Given there's no printing and it's not out of control, no, it's not.

I don't think you can.
People want to know that they can trust the technology before they use it. For some that will mean understanding the workings enough to be confident; for others that will mean having the reassurances of people they know and trust (who they assume understand the workings); and for others it will mean waiting until the tech is mainstream and common - a kind of safety in numbers approach. 
Sounds like you are the first, and you hope the people you are talking to are the second. Maybe they need some more people they trust to assure them that it's safe before they jump in, or maybe they are actually the third type and won't be comfortable until it is mainstream. 
Right now there aren't any huge reasons to use BTC, and one might as well just forget about it. But giving people the assurance that you trust the network is a good thing and it will stay with them.

I don't see any reasoning here. This is just a statement of opinion.
If 'they' wanted to shut down Bitcoin they can launch a DOS attack to flood the blockchain. They can block relevant ports wherever possible on friendly infrastructure. They can attempt to hack encryption (while I'm not sure it's possible, many people believe the NSA have means of cracking 256 bit encryption).
If 'they' wanted to stop Bitcoin there'd be a PR onslaught over various made up problems and threats on the mainstream media.
The truth is that 'they' love Bitcoin because it's a new source if revenue that will be incredibly easy to mine for customer and user data.

That's asinine. If the trend isn't going to continue why talk about the trend? The trend *is* exponential. The log chart is what should be used to represent exponential growth. It's that simple.
I don't believe the trend will end today, I just don't agree that we can assume it will continue for 5 years. There will undoubtedly be a saturation point, and the value will flatten out. But the fact remains that at this point in time, the trend is best represented by using a logarithmic y axis in the price chart. It's not unheard of, and long term charts usually use log values. Look at long term gold price, inflation or GDP growth. Anything where value changes by an order of magnitude *needs* the log chart to make sense.

This is the same as sqrt(good trans)/sqrt(total trans), or sqrt(good/total). I'm wary of someone proposing a less than ideal formula, it implies less than ideal thinking. 
This "score" will not then 
- always be between 0 and 1 (what do you do with this number? Why do we need to sqrt it?) 
- not account for the age of transactions 
- not account for size of transactions 
- not be able to reconcile transactions across multiple addresses (eg I have three addresses) 
So I create an address, buy a coffee, buy some gum, buy the paper and then - using my good score - scam someone on a new car. And repeat.

Not sure if you're serious and stupid or deliberately exaggerating. Why in earth would you think that the top 10 million high income individuals got there through inheritance? Do you have *any* evidence for this other than the story that you tell yourself to feel better?
If you ever worked for anyone who started a successful business (more than 5 employees?) then there's good chance you know someone in the top 1%. If you know a doctor or someone who excels in some professional field then there's a good chance. If you know a great technology person there's a good chance.
The argument about the 1% being evil rent seeking families of wealth is one of the most asinine I've ever heard. If you look at the statistics, the top 1% of income earners make something like $700k / family per year. Yes, that's a lot - but it's not inconceivable to anyone working in professional field, or anyone who is a job creating business person.

Almost all investment in Bitcoin is US based, so if the regulatory environment becomes untenable Bitcoin will take a huge hit. Surely you can see that.
Many other countries, like it or not, take their regulatory lead from the USA. Doesn't mean they copy the USA, but they wait and see what they do before deciding whether they should follow the lead. See Bobby Lee's comments about the rest of the world watching.

I'm extremely interested in your 6% cashback card with no fee - can you share it? I'm sure the credit card company will have no problem with you giving the name. I find lots of 1% no fee cards, a few 2%, but everything above that has fees. 
Realize that "free" international transfers are a huge scam. What's the spread on their buy/sell prices? I've been able to do "free" international transfers for years, but my bank's spread was 5%. That means I'm buying foreign currency for about 2.5% above the spot price. If you try you might get to 2%. You'll never get close to 1% unless you *are* a bank. 
With bitcoin I can get in for 0.5%. Of course at the moment I need to get in and out to transfer my money, but ideally (and if BTC was widely accepted) I wouldn't even need to sell the coins - I'd just save or spend them. And if I don't need to buy them, either - maybe I get paid in BTC - then I have an almost competely frictionless currency.

I understand your point of nothing having intrinsic value, but I don't agree. Gold has both value in both aesthetic and industrial ways, as do other precious metals.

Typically a company will be relatively fixed to the currency that it deals with. A Japanese company makes yen so is valued in yen; a US company makes USD so is valued in USD. If the USD/yen exchange rate changes dramatically neither company's value should change as a result. 
If your imaginary company earns BTC then sure, their value should stay the same in BTC. But if they earn USD their value will be relative to the US dollar, not BTC.

He has around $3700 currently in the form of BTC. Is he comfortable holding that much BTC? Why that amount specifically? 
Consider he found $3700 cash. Would he invest all of it in BTC? There is minimal friction and transfer cost associated with BTC at the moment so that's the decision he is making. 
To decide what he "should do" you best imagine that he has $3700 worth of "stuff" that can be converted into BTC or USD. How much are you going to put into BTC?

This makes me wonder what you've been reading about QE. Are you listening to Krugman... or Kaiser?
Economic fundamentals are not Ludwig von Mises. There's nothing wrong with QE. If you worry about "this country" then what country would you have faith in, and what's your plan for the future?

Sorry but I don't have 20 minutes to watch a guy sketch crap on a screen. 
I've looked at the logarithmic growth rates of BTC value and I don't think it's a point of concern, but I don't believe the usage has increased in line with the value. The price has been driven up by investors, not by "regular people" who are choosing to use BTC as a currency. For most people it is not a useful currency at the moment - instead it is a speculative investment, like a tulip.

Here's a quick lesson in what is known as 'ramping'.
If I wanted to sell bitcoins I'd tell you the price is going to go up, encouraging you and others to buy, driving the price up so that I can sell for increased profit.
If I wanted to buy bitcoins I'd tell you that the price is going to go down, which would discourage you from buying or encourage others to sell before the price dropped. I'd then be able to buy for a lower price.
The truth is that no one knows for sure. The long term trend so far is up.

It is value by decree. Not law, not force, but decree. The government and the people decree the value of the dollar through a free market of negotiation. The people (sans government) decree the value of bitcoin through a free market and b negotiation.
It's hard for you to accept, given you hate (your understanding of) fiat and you love bitcoin, but just stop hating fiat.

I think "the money never passes through [the miner's] hands" is misleading. BTC never really passes through anyone's hands. It is only ever assigned to someone. The miners, by way of confirming transactions, are the ones who assign (or confirm the assignment of) coins.
It's easy for you to say that miners are not money transmitters, but they are clearly involved in the facilitation of transactions and thus money transmission. You'd need a lawyer to decide if they touch on the regulated area, and FinCEN clearly believe that they do.

So, for example, one BTC is worth $800. You want to tell some stores that a BTC is going to be worth $800 so they can fix their prices.
And what happens when the price changes?
You can't just "use" a constant exchange rate if they exchange rate isn't going to be constant. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:27:23
That's bullshit. The USD is far more stable than BTC is likely to be for many many years.
BTC is more efficient (ie lower friction) than old style currency which is its primary advantage - transfers especially international and between institutions are virtually free. Free of typical financial fees of 3%+

Our current system uses exactly this. Dollars and cents. Bitcoins and satochis.
I don't buy a book for nine and ninety nine hundredths of a dollar, do I?
Realistically, things are not going to cost 1.0210301 BTC. If Bitcoin is successful then things will be purchased in multiples of Satoshi, with BTC being worth an awful lot. 
Planning what we will call things like this is silly. A suitable naming convention will arise as appropriate in good time. For now, one point two five Bitcoin works fine.

He will have to prove when he bought the BTC; failing to keep accurate tax records is a big problem. If he got them for free then the entire sale value is taxable. You can't just say "I paid $2000" - the response is "When? How? Where's the evidence?"

If you have a mortgage then the bank will never go for it. The risk is too great for them. When you normally sell a house the banks attorney will make sure they take their cut before you get yours.

Intelligent people have studied money for a very long time and those are agreed and understood definitions. You don't need to abide by them but you can at least have the common sense to take those concepts into account when thinking about the topic.
Bitcoin is extremely rarely used as money. It is rarely used as a payment mechanism, but when the "price" is a real time calculation of the current BTCUSD exchange rate and the proceeds are immediately converted into USD, the item is being bought in USD merely using BTC as an exchange mechanism. The number of cases where an item is available in BTC without being tied to USD is minute.
Maybe you don't agree with history on the definition of money. Good for you. Bitcoin doesn't really fit into that definition.

I actually defined the word fiat in my post, and it means 'let it be done' or 'by decree'. It's not an English word so the definition is very sketchy, and the Latin roots have no reference to government.

He's not saying it isn't revolutionary - in fact, I think he's worried because it is revolutionary. He's simply stating it has no external stabilizers and is difficult to tax. He's right about those two things, and he believes that makes it evil. That's his reasonable opinion.

That's not the reason the sale is not really in bitcoin. The reason the sale is not really in bitcoin is because the price is set in USD.
If I sell something for 1 BTC then I'm selling it in bitcoin. If I sell something for USD$1000 worth of bitcoin, then I'm selling it in USD$.

Although the odds are written 1/1 it's not a fair bet - the value of the bet is dependent on the outcome.
If you bet "yes" and you win you get at least 10x your placement, because the value of the placed BTC will be at least 10x current value. 
If you bet "no" you win somewhere between 0 and 10 times your bet.
