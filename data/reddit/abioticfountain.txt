Exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
As a secondary question, is there a way to easily move my wallet to an external HD? I'm not always running my wallet for obvious reasons, and I would like to store the whole thing on my HD, but still be able to access it whenever.
Edit: I of course have my wallet.dat backed up somewhere else in case I'm making a foolish descision by trying to move the wallet.

What I mean is I don't want the 160 GB on my Computer, I want them on my external Hard Drive (1TB). But I also want to be able to run it off of my HD. Is that possible?
