Here is no-brainer Python script for someone who got the dictionary.
Just Monte-Carlo it to death
    import random
    import BrainWallet
    import re
    target = "13D1VNPVyepQWMBPR8XtfQfQ4FJ4qu7DD3"
    words = []
    lens = {}
    with open('dict.txt') as fh:
        for s in fh.readlines():
            s = s.strip().lower()
            if re.match("^\w+$", s):
                words.append(s)
                l = len(s)
                if not l in lens:
                    lens[l] = []
                lens[l].append(s)
    while True:
        brainWallet = random.choice(words)+random.choice(words)
        left = 17 - len(brainWallet)
        if left &gt; 0:
            brainWallet += random.choice(lens[left])
            for i in xrange(10):
                bw = brainWallet+str(i)
                addr = BrainWallet.get_addr(BrainWallet.gen_eckey(passphrase=bw)) 
                if addr[0] == target:
                    print addr
                    print bw
                    exit(0)

There could be a brain wallet of length 100 or just a random private key. No way to check if challenge is valid.

Check if BrainWallet.py is working as standalone script.

that means your dictionary has no words with length = 2
change 'if left &gt; 0:' to
    if left &gt; 0 and left in lens:

The deal is as big as if two people generate same private key. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 11:44:53
it is not big deal if two or more private/public keypairs generate same address.
