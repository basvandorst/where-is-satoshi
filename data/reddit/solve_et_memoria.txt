Incase you or others don't actually know why:  the reason Bitcoin-people hate on bcash-people is because bcash-people refer to bcash as "bitcoin". This is objectionable because Bitcoin started in 2009 whereas the bcash fork of Bitcoin took place in 2017.  
 
For an example.... Bcash-people will say that their 10 year anniversary will be marked in 2019.  
  
This type of misinformation is problematic for many reasons. For example if you go to Bitcoin.com or r/btc you will be left with the impression that Bcash is what we analyze when doing technical analysis of the past decade of Bitcoin trade history. This is counter-productive. 
 
Normally when someone explains this a dozen other n00bs will reply with "well if you're too stupid to research your investments you're going to get screwed and that's the risk anyone takes". This is not incorrect. The reason we take the time to explain the difference between Bitcoin and Bcash is to contribute to a safer, more transparent climate that encourages new money to invest in crypto, generally speaking.

Actually there is a clear cut answer to "why do bcash people believe bcash is bitcoin?" and someone else already posted it. Here is the quote: 
 
"For example, their view is that BTC stopped being bitcoin when segwit was introduced, and BCH is now continuing the original chain/vision." 
 
I don't know how to properly reddit-quote, but what I just pasted is the answer to your question.

I have around 15 aluminium 1a (which is a division of yoyo) yoyos that cost $75-$165 USD made by small companies here in the USA/Canada.
Google: onedrop, clyw, spyy, anti-yo, general-yo.
4 of those 5 companies are profitable businesses selling cnc milled aluminium objects to what I suspect is a much smaller demograph than bitcoin.
