And only $8 per transaction!
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:23:05
Just wonderful if that unconfirmed amount is normal because I sent some btc about an hour ago and it's still pending.. I love Bitcoin and this isn't a shill post.

This picture is the reason why I'm glad I didn't get into Bitcoin until later.. I would of bought like 500 btc for like 5 bucks back in the day and would of formatted the hard drive or lost it somehow and would of spent the rest of my life thinking of what if...

Thanks for allowing us to take part in something that you don't own or control.
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:55:09
Did you buy it with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:39:06
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:52:55
How can you block something that you don't control?
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:41:16
I don't understand I though swift was a transfer system that processes transactions where bitcoin is just a currency.
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:45:44
Great job sending like 50 bucks to make sure it works first.

Am I the only person that uses btc to buy shit online?
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:44:16
So I'm putting away a couple hundy each paycheck in my btc wallet. The more I collect the better I feel, it's actually electronic money I own, I don't have to keep cash hidden in my house!

Also don't use Google authenticator, there is no back ups or a efficient way to transfer it to a new phone, you have to do it manually and it doesn't assiocate with your Google account just physcial phone.
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:05:40
I had like 15 of them.. I transferred them over.. well I had to log into each site and change the 2fa on each..  last pass is great

By wake up you mean put fiat into bitcoin right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:26:23
Ooh... Just 1 thousand reviews
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:30:49
In my opinion, alts are a highly overrated phenomenon. Bitcoin gets on perfectly fine without a centralized bank. See: there's the block chain beneath us now... No fiat. No fiat at all, but giant blocks, ten minutes long, scoured by fud and fomo into a constantly changing shit show we called crypto, flowing and shifting around the pole in ripples ten thousand blocks wide. Tell me... would it be greatly improved by another shitcoin?

It all began with the forging of the Great blockchain. Three alts were given to the Elves; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven, to the Dwarf Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine shit coins were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire gains.

I'm starting to think most people on this sub misunderstands the real value of Bitcoin. Financial freedom from the world banks and the ability to send and receive a currency that anyone in the world can use should be discussed more than the overall price of the coin. Mostly all new markets with this much press will always fluctuate this dramatically, Bitcoin will continue to grow in price and fluctuate less and less. More people from all over the world will start using the currency when their nation's currencies become less and less secure. That's when bitcoins true value will be revealed, priceless.

You sound like a child. Did coinbase not accept the DEBIT CARD cause you're parents cancelled it? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:31:25
Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this in.. I'm just really behind block chain and bitcoin! It's sucha weird concept owning the money that you earned....

Thank you cousin, let squat together and give thanks.

I'm thinking verge... You can actually still mine that effectively.

It's nice the banks let us spend our money.

Sounds like verge can fill the void here.

What helped me was just stopping.. that may sound weird, I have this thing if I set a date or say I'll quit or start something at a specific time I always fail. Just stop, the first few days are rough, you can do it. Also don't tell anyone or make a big deal about it.. Thinking about it differently might help too.. You don't have a problem, there's nothing wrong with enjoying something.. You're stopping something you enjoy, take comfort in that and know it will take some time but you'll stop enjoying it all together.

I envision a sea of excerise bikes hooked up to batteries that powers Putin's mining operation. All who oppose him will have to ride the blockchain until their leg muscles catch fire, they will burn for mother Russia. You and me cousin, we will ride the block chain to the very end, bylat!
